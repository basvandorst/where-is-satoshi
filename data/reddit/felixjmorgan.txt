I have faith in the longevity in crypto and still think BTC is the safest bet for growth in at least the mid term. It’s not a blind bet, it’s a bet in the transformational capability of the technology above the short term panics of the general public. There’s been a LOT of newcomers recently and I don’t think their inexperience should influence my decisions too significantly.

Futures are basically trading on what you think is going to happen to an asset (bitcoin, gold, whatever) in the future. You don't trade the asset, just a contract that says you will pay X amount at Y date for Z asset.
Good explanation here - 
NASDAQ is the second largest exchange in the world, so them launching BTC futures is pretty huge news.

This place is good - 
On the corner of 4th and Brazos. Went there during SXSW, was really good.

I've got one, you wouldn't believe how often women ask about it. I don't have bitcoins on it though, just use this face -

What's the best way to purchase from the UK currently? The only options I can see take up to 24 hours, and obviously it's so volatile at the moment that I want something a lot quicker.
