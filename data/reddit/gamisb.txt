Has the full weight and force of the largest military power ensuring the protection of any goods exchanged for it on a global scale. Has one of the largest financial institutions in the world dedicated to its stability and implementation world wide. Is one of the largest currency in use for nations credit and debt built off of its founding nations stability and credibility.
You want to talk backing but you’re propping up a currency that’s made up of zeros and ones whose creator abandoned the project after creating?

And yet you've still yet to explain what "Too big to fail" is supposed to mean in this conversation.

Anyone that generalizes “90 years” of financial history without a specific moment in mind has no argument.
Why don’t you educate me instead of of hedging off an assumption?

Because what makes money work is having tangible and understood security and backing behind it. Crypto currency lacks both of those entirely.
Nothing will replace the dollar so long as “Full faith and credit of the United States” retains its global appeal.

Well it's no wonder no one takes them seriously.

No, what I said was...


Bitcoin or any crypto currency is not new, just redressed ideas in a digital form. It lacks the sufficient backing and protections necessary for any currency to work within global financial structures and barely operates even within personal financial transactions. Outside of its fanbase it's worthless and fails to convey the basic measure of faith that every transaction since the dawn of man has stood on.
Without those it isn't better by any measure.

Your point? 
Is this a common trope here? Can’t make an argument so bitcoiners just throw out slogans or make wide sweeping generalizations?
