Damn American banks are years behind Europe.

So many relevant usernames here

Since XBT are a finite number and are not renewable, they're not 100% a currency but more like a commodity.

So if a game for windows offend you, boycott Microsoft, am I right?

I was going to pour my XBT into mtgox in november, but my ID card copy was refused because... I still don't know, so my account never went validated.
Well, that was close.

You have never watched BBC.

I should open a bitcoin exchange...

We are the witnesses of a new era.
Like the first time a national ad referred an HTTP address.

I would buy, too.
I'm thinking about converting my litecoins into bitcoins or buying bitcoins with dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:39:02
The article points that. I used google translate.

That thing looks more like a coin changer in an arcade than an usual ATM.

In Europe, paid vacations is the norm for almost any kind of employment and everyone is happy and prices are still fair (and don't let me talk about medical prices).

If you think health care is expensive in Europe, don't get hurt in the US.

It's already rising on kraken.

After reading the update, it looks even more fake.  All the dialogue seems a huge 4chan style green text. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:08:42


Tell that to Swissair.

Just think that the best way to make money from bitcoins now is holding an exchange platform.
@_date: 2016-11-18 11:32:02
Ask your local bank for Indian currency cash, that's how I do usually and my bank has a pretty good conversion rate. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:46:44
You pay fees and commission every time you pay with your credit card... 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:17:15
Not my battle, but even if there are [no laws about online refunds in Switzerland]( it's a bit of a dick move to reject a refund offer **after 1 day** since even Manor and Migros will give you a refund no-questions-asked.
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:38:38
If you're in Switzerland, you can buy bitcoin from any tickets terminal. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 19:43:15
I missed usenet. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:24:55
By Microsoft past records, they could be able to actually release the only bitcoin blockchain that could duplicate your coins, crash the whole chain and erase your wallet remotely. All this while creating a proprietary standard incompatible with anything else existing. 
No, thanks.

It's basically a "meat market".
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:55:37
In a country where you could get arrested if you're walking on the streets with a beer in your hand?

The problem with drunk driving death in the US is that you basically handle it the other way around.
First you make your teenagers taste the alcohol, grow a responsability around it, then you give them the car keys. Not before.

Also called the Euro.

You spelled Fox wrong.

This is so going everywhere on facebook.

Swiss francs?
