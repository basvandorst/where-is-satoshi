Thanks for correction. Fixed now.

This was done in Adobe Illustrator and a lot of the images were made from scratch (as there is not a ton of BTC related graphics out there)

Thanks for pointing out - we are looking to do a round of revisions sometime this week and will add it to the list :)

Much appreciated!

The sign is a tilda:  ~  
It means "approximate".  We didn't want to use the exact amount of bitcoins mined because it changes every day.

We have noticed a few small things as well. If everyone can come to agree on the specifics of the errors, we will be happy to consider revising this later this week.
We've also toyed with the idea of just continuing to update it every time a new significant BTC related event happens.

Hi Redditors - thanks for the feedback on this.  Sorry for the slow server.  Zero Hedge and Business Insider both posted it at the same time and bogged down our server.
On the citations side, you are correct - we were in such a rush to get this up that we forgot to add.  Perhaps we can update later today.  Most of the stuff is from btc related sites so there's not too much that should be out of the blue.
Good points on the public key cryptography and fast/free transactions fronts.  For the latter we originally had it in there but eventually tossed it because we had so much copy.  Too much copy in an infographic = not good.

Bennett certainly did the design, and he's fantastically talented! Some other folks from our team also helped with the research, flow, copy, and all of that goodness.

You are right that low rates helped create the mortgage crisis in the first place, but we are referring specifically to QE1 (in the United States) which started three months after the Lehman Bros. collapse.

Thanks for posting! Here's the HTML version that is a little easier to view than the .jpg

The introduction was to set the stage for the rest of narrative. We didn't mean to imply that the subprime mortgage led to BTC, but definitely that the chain of events did make people more leery of government issued currency. Our point here was more that BTC couldn't have come around at a better time :)
