you can get all of those combinations.
cheap and fast would be unconfirmed transactions. not reliable; still part of bitcoin.
two years ago bitpay forwarded unconfirmed transactions as "paid" to vendors. zero delay pizza payments... good times :)

because... 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:37:19
is anyone testing spam attacks? eg sending millions of payments in circles back and forth across as many nodes as possible?
those are the "real network" tests i'd be interested in. denial of service kind of things.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:35:18
unconfirmed transactions are instant :P

There are no "greek euros". The paper has the same value where ever it was printed.
A funny idea is also that some people suggest just creating drachma again. Trust in the whole makes money worth something. Who would trust this nee drachma created out of thon air? Id keep selling goods and service for euros, even if they are not official tender...

Why implement (cpu) mining? Seems useless to me and goes against the idea of a barebones full node daemon.
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:39:35
you can. also true for some python/django/... sites with mod_python.
state of the art would be a standalone process for the app and eg nginx as a frontend server only forwarding requests to the app server and serving static content.

Watching that my first thought (after: aah friends) was how easy computers were. Clean ui, nice colors, very task oriented (my computer: files: open file: edit...)... today windows, osx, ubuntu/gnome, android... i always feel like they are hiding something from me, forcing to do things their way... everything is virtual and on who knows what cloud...

Wow... considering how bad that all sounds for bitcoin, 275 is pretty good... who else can loose nearly half a billion and still traded as much.
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:57:35
based on that: would that mean most coins sold in 2014 and today that are pushing the price down, are newly mined and not early adopters cashing out?
edit: hm well probably not. early adopter could have been moving around coins all the time, and still sell chunks now. is an age analysis of moving coins possible or the "source" lost due to amounts splitting and merging in transactions?
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:56:11
No it does not mean that. The comma is important. They gave you the choice to either a) verify and release deposit or b) no verify and get money back.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:58:06
Do your thing... whatever you think best... i own a few btc and encourage friends and family to get/look into it,  but "trust" with money things is a risky business. People can hate you forever if things go wrong with money and promises.

~~nope. it's the other way round.~~ edit: oh, you mean "decimal mark" by saying "dot"
source: i live here and [wikipedia](
actually using dots _or_ commas to group thousands is stupid.
people should use a blank if they must, e.g.: 
"USD 102 400,00" or "USD 102 400.00" ... no confusion and it's an accepted [ISO standard]( (except it looks weird :P).

then i disagree: 
i think the wealth of information makes most people today too lazy to think or analyze. it's all right there without effort and most is consumed without second thought or questioning. if it's not easily found it does not exist. there is a widespread ignorance of things that came before the internet. part of that is the thought that it was all better in some mythical, romantic past.
this is definitely not the first time people have worried about the status quo and the power of their leaders. the difference is that some people think, that clicking and sending messages to some fcc website are strong actions and revolutionary. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:55:40
there was no deflation.
my rent and insurance was raised. energy did not get cheaper. maybe a few things stayed the same, but most things still got more expensive. 
and there was no significant raise in wages and promised tax reforms will probably dont come due to bank bailouts and simply lack of funds.
all the time i read about shrinking of consumer spending. people dont go on vacation, buy less electronics, dont eat out. you simply cant spend what you dont have and those who do get trapped in dept.
i am feeling pretty good about my bitcoins as a store of value these days.
edit: here are some numbers:  only '09 had some negative inflation

subjective is not code for anything, it's a word with established meaning.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:43:38
or simply from the source: 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:06:54
it seems people have discovered it: huge bids appeared this morning
EDIT: a word
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:13:33
okay, so if it's not subjective, it must be objective.
objective means "not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts" according to google.
then why does the price (the representation people use to enumerate value) of gold and bitcoin change over time?
how can something change over time, when it (the value) is based on unchangeable properties of a thing (facts) and not opinions?
the price is determined by supply and demand, changeable over time, influenced by people. the value is not an objective fact.
the value is subjective.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:39:02
Yes, that is exactly what i am saying. All crypto coins get their value from faith, from hype, from what people think other people will buy. Taking advantage of rising and falling between coins can produce output. Output is what traders want. Greed powers crypto coin.
Edit: maybe not *only* greed, but its a big part.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:32:21
and now one of them is gone.
i would not completely rule out a bug in the exchange. you got to have a lot of money on the exchange to place such a bid... why put it there, if you do not intend to use it...? on the other hand if the exchange allowed the bid without having the funds... bug.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:43:50


so literally subjective.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:36:43
i keep thinking of *btc* as the "thing to be traded" and not the *price* to be offered and asked for... it's weird.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:53:46
it does not produce worth, not any value, not anything really... of course. but there are now more euros in my pocket and less in someone elses. it produced output for me.
trading bitcoins is like the whole financial system: a big nothing where people win when other people loose.
i am sure i do not fully understand how bitcoins work cryptographicalyl in detail or how economies work, but my guess is, that those loudest in this subreddit don't either.

@_date: 2013-11-29 06:55:43
Maybe i was misusing the word "arbitrage". I followed btc and ltc closely on multiple markets and there are times when eg buying btc "via" an ltc/btc exchange is cheaper than directly eur/btc before a rise. Not a lot but crypto/crypto markets allow "weirder" trading, with the only goal of making money.
The other thing others mentioned: yes ltc follows btc. See, that is why i say both are bought and sold because of the same motivation: faith in the suckers (great quote!)
But ltc was a little late to the game, which made it so great to invest in before the hearings at 4 eur and even this week at 10 or 15. It was practically guaranteed to follow btc upward and it will continue to do so.
If btc fails ltc will too though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:54:24
it makes sense for trading, exploiting arbitrate etc... and since trading is what drives a lot of attention to btc currently there is room for more than one.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:10:20
those are bids, right?... well, they want to buy. i am stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:44:59
Bitcoins do not gain value by themselves. The extra meals are paid for by real people putting real money into btx purchases. Its not magic.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:26:02
it is *madness*, current bid: volume: 3,179.975 at price €505.00000 :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:11:41
Apples and oranges.
Paypal confirms instantly when i order pizza online and free for me as customer.
My bank recently transferred (sepa) a few hundred eur to somebody elses account (at the same bank) in a few minutes (to buy btc) for free. Both transactions happened in the same system.
When comparing transactions you must take into account if you are interfacing with anything. Thats where traditionally fees and delays occur. Btc transfers are within the system and of course should be instantaneous... 
Eur to btc exchange transfers take ages. That is what should be measured as transfer speed.
...and also free. There is all this big talk how there is no middleman and p2p and stuff, but the whole transaction queuing and fee mess breaks that idea. Even if the middleman is this faceless privately operated network of nodes.
Transfers within the system are absolutely not groundbreaking fast and also not cheaper with bitcoin. Especially for those ever so popular micropayments the fees are too high. And waiting a few hours for your 0-fee transaction to go through to pay for that iphone app or mp3 you just bought does not make for happy customers either.
I think btc are great, but the system also has a lot of deep rooted problems to solve on the way to mainstream.
