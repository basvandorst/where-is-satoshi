This is only if you're interested in pure price speculation. The existence of other coins does not affect the Bitcoin software architecture or network. It does so indirectly as users voluntarily enter or exit the space in terms of running nodes or mining. Otherwise, the volatility experienced will exist regardless of tethers or alts. 
Also, in terms of the confidence of people, if they are only price speculating, then they will exit (weak hands) and people more interested in the technological development of the project will have a better chance to enter and hodl. I would argue it will create more confidence as these other tokens implode or fail.

No, *she* is not being fair for failing to consider what OP had to say, especially when trying to explain the merits of a hardware wallet. I imagine OP tried to explain the merits of BTC as a tech innovation, and she failed to see any points of interest. This is short sightedness on her part. If a bank's approval is all you require for something to be *real*, then your opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. I bet she blindly trusts her banking financial adviser without question too, because the guy "is her friend" or some other nonsense.

It is pure supply and demand. Supply is absolutely fixed. Demand *as a technology* will fluctuate based on how many people actually look into it as it ought to exist *as a hedge against a more volatile store of value*. If you think investor money is the only thing upholding btc value, then I would argue it's pretty short sighted. Momentary panics will affect the rate, but it doesn't affect btc as a stable store of value in terms of supply. In terms of demand one could argue that their respective stores of value are credible and stable, but look at 2008, and lots of more volatile states going through hyperinflation or government censorship of financial decision making. 
In any case, what I'm hearing from you is panic due to momentary price fluctuations. I'm saying that it's happened before and people's confidence had been shaken time and time again, moving prices down 60% for over a year from my experience, but as long as the tech doesn't change, it'll be fine in the long term.

This is a fair stance. Though there's only so much you can discuss on the technical side, there's plenty of speculation to be done BEYOND price, such as how this will impact socioeconomics, psychology (going from not rich to rich very quickly), marketing, a new industry being born...etc. I wouldn't mind seeing more discussions on these other speculative topics rather than purely the price. In any case, the price is what captures the attention of most when technicals can only go so far before it becomes too dry. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:51:20
Stop it. There is no "enemy of bitcoin", there's only financial incentive. Using language like this makes you sound silly and not serious. If you want to be treated seriously, explain your position with some thought and organization to get your point across. Also, these problems and attacks that bitcoin experiences were expected long ago. You don't claim to disrupt banking and expect to get away with it smoothly. This is also an opportunity for bitcoin to continue proving itself by encouraging competitors to enter the fray.

@_date: 2017-12-27 04:30:11
I'm just answering the question. The noobs are only interested in price because it's typically a minority of people who are interested in the tech. There's a lack of understanding as to where crypto is getting its value/network effect. Similar to how most people do not understand a car engine, but will buy a good looking car nonetheless. I recognize that the noobs gave hodlers wealth. I was not attacking noobs for being noobs. They are what they are until they have weathered some storms.

Do you have another segwit address generator to recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:45:57
This is a pretty dumb position to have. Any coin you support at this moment requires industry adoption which is *communicated to industry through client demand*. Just because you want alts to succeed doesn't mean you can escape this fact that you likely leverage to get your shit coins accepted. Also, if your alt gets main stream recognition, you don't think it will go through scaling issues and more complex issues due to increasing block size limit as the only solution offered? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:49:18
If you're paying fees from exchanges, then it's not bitcoin's fault. The exchange is not supporting segwit. Demand segwit and custom fees from your services.

May I suggest that this interaction between you and diregoat is also something emergent of the network effect? People are coming together to learn from one another voluntarily. This is fundamental to the bitcoin P2P protocol. The basic architecture of the protocol may be spilling into the way we communicate with one another. Multiply that to a global scale, and you have a sociological phenomenon. Since bitcoin is a way to communicate trust, then this would make sense.

I think you make a very good point. I suppose once this service is decentralized, then it will just be direct btc transfer with the blockchain. The issue with only using the blockchain currently is that people have to download wallets before they can receive or view their coins. ChangeTip allows for a transitional experience between a familiar space (social media) and bitcoin. 
I can't imagine ChangeTip removing their fees...that's how they will expand their business. So a new service will have to be developed that doesn't require fees. Something like OpenBazaar, but for tipping and personalized digital addresses in any format.
Edit: Also, I think your suggestion is amazing. Put the onus of the fees on the depositer. But then the only person paying the fee would be a person who wants to continue using ChangeTip through directly depositing into ones own tipping account...not sure how that would affect their bottom line.

It could be that Satoshi presenting him/her/themselves in the public light would allow for the opportunity from attacking parties to create smear campaigns to attack Bitcoin's credibility. If we had a face to remind us of the creator every time we read about Bitcoin, the discussion would be less about Bitcoin and more about the person. Maybe Satoshi understood Bitcoin is too important to deal with distractions?
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:00:45
Hmm, maybe I am not being clear. I meant to say that I would like people who don't use social media to be able to receive tips. I don't see that feature on the tip.me account. 
For example, I have friends I've been wanting to send tips to on Facebook, but it's in beta, and these people are not Twitter users. As an alternative, I would like to send them tips through e-mail.

I would trust it more if it had an escrow. The reputation is fine, but I want to buy a decent sum, and the platform is just not there yet for me. I'm looking at a seller right now, and this user has placed a 1.8B buy limit because I have no reputation on the site.
Edit: with regards to the escrow, i just don't feel it's safe enough, nor can I purchase as much as I'd like without higher risk. The price fluctuates between users if I want to spread risk, and it just feels like a headache.

If the answers already provided are not enough to answer your question, then the question would have to be adjusted. If there were no miners at all (due to your suggestion that they work on consensus decision making), then you are really asking the question "wouldn't it kill bitcoin if no one serviced the network", or more simply "wouldn't bitcoin be worth nothing if no one used it", then the answer would be yes.

Late to the game, but I too have been completely absorbed by Bitcoin and its implication on a social and global scale. My background is counselling, but my interests have expanded to finance, economics, and social justice. Money is another means to convey trust and to communicate production. Many problems have evolved from corrupted centralized systems (even relief funds can't be trusted in the hands of centralized authority), so what brilliant way to fund programs that people create for specific needs. I have become so obsessed with Bitcoin to the point that I'm running personal tutorials all the time, and running informal info sessions for the public. This community is brilliant. Cheers!

I've always liked the "This week in (subreddit)" threads with images depicting weekly developments. Bitcoin could have something similar based on the past week's most upvoted or comment laden content with a mixture of BTC core dev news. 
It could be something more organized too, like an update on the following list:
* Adoption (News on Canadian business adoption)
* Core development news (Mike Hearns' commentary on mainstream adoption)
* Phishing attacks or vulnerabilities (Continued phishing on e-mails with examples provided like a screen shot)
* Business commentary (not new, but what comes to mind is the Butterfly labs CEO trying to be part of policy making)
* Drama in the community (The Fappening)
* The overall emerging industry, anything that's innovative (OpenBazaar beta)
This provides a very brief summary to keep everyone informed on the basics of the week. If additional details are required, the individual can do their own research.
**Edit**: a word
**2nd Edit**: Maybe even have a small business adoption or not-for-profit featured at the bottom to get people feeling like they can take part in a larger movement as well.

Leaders were important in the old system which relied on authority due to limitations on information dispersal and trust. The information age we are currently in necessarily provide us with an abundance of knowledge and perspectives. The need for a leader is therefore decreased. 
Edit: satoshi remaining anonymous also seems to be empowering developers to continue developing, which expands the networks responsibility to fend for itself. It's not the sole responsibility of satoshi to fix everything.

From my understanding of the technology, the integrity of the blockchain is maintained by the network of nodes. Nodes are devices running a wallet which also keeps track of transactions (a copy of the blockchain...not every wallet needs to keep a copy of the blockchain). Every transaction needs to be verified by all the nodes throughout the network. Though a transaction is published, it is recommended that the transaction should have 6 confirmations before it can be seen as being fully paid out (this is to avoid double spends), the confirmations are nodes that have gone through the block chain and confirmed that address X has the amount of coins it is trying to spend. This reliance on the network prevents corruption as the blockchain will not make sense of transactions that are not synced (or are corrupted). The network mitigates corruption if one node goes down, which also is what makes this technology "decentralized".
I believe that's how it works, though it may not be the question you're asking.

I haven't gone through the entire thread, but it feels like you're sitting in a place of privilege, which is something you've already indicated in your OP. Perhaps YOU don't need to send money to China, but :
1. many immigrants wish to send money back "home". Unfortunately, there are major fees associated with the claiming of the wired fees. 
Someone has already mentioned that this is still a developing tech, so many of the perks for a person in your position are yet to be created. However:
2. there are many perks for those in the developing world, especially the unbanked or underbanked (no or limited access to the global financial infrastructure). Another big factor is government devaluing your dollar through inflation, so Bitcoin is used as a store of value for your earnings.

I've been an enthusiast for about 9 months. I've had lengthy discussions with close friends, and tend not to preach unless people ask about it. I passively educate on the topic, and I've done some information sessions for the public as well. I guess I'm slowly building a reputation and people have it in the back of their minds that they could begin accepting Bitcoin for products and services.

That would suggest there was no demand for Bitcoin. The price is based on demand of the technology. Look at market-caps. 
If no one wanted to use Bitcoin, and decided to sell their Bitcoin, there would reach a point where the price they are selling at is too high because they will have difficulty selling them up, leading to a price decrease (voluntary on the part of the seller). Does that make sense? This is what makes the price drop: when there are too many sellers and not enough buyers.

The idea was not to replace browsers, but really just a recognition that the blockchain, even though it exists online, is something different to a website. Perhaps a website could be created for what I'm envisioning, which is really a searchable platform for all blockchain related transactions, whether they be bitcoin or something else. Perhaps for the moment this could be done through browsers. 
In the future, I imagine blockchain transactions to be more complex, requiring a different apparatus to navigate altogether. 
Edit: Bitcoin may incentivize a decentralized cloud storage network requiring a new app in order to interact with it effectively outside of browsers.

There are some wallets that will support both chains and give you the option. After aug1, everyone holding btc will also have bch. The part where you may have security vulnerability is when you upload from seed attempting to access bch if you hadn't first moved your btc from the same seed. The reason why it's a vulnerability risk is due to risky bch wallet software that have not been tested thoroughly, and there may be a chance the wallet is malware.

Personal opinion : bitcoin is primarily interesting to me because of its decentralized and open  *development*. If you check github for the authorship of the 3 coins (bitcoin core, bcash, b2x), you'll see that authorship is most active and populous in core (31). I trust that many people with github history are scanning through code, staying transparent, and developing on money technology. I do not trust ~~3~~ 7 devs working on the past month for a new financial paradigm,claiming to be the best manifestation of satoshi's vision and *the one true coin*. 
Assuming you're a native English speaker (or at least a fluent one), i find it helpful to look for cult like language to raise skepticism. If a group raises platitudes commonly with little to back up, or becomes defensive when asked to explain, then i lose confidence in that project.

Bcash is a hardfork from bitcoin. A hardfork is an irreversible update. Bcash happened because of the contentious scaling debate that created 2 factions where bitcoin core preferred optimizing blocks before a block size increase and bitcoin unlimited (bu) preferred dynamic block size increases immediately (hence their name). Bcash is a project after bu rebranded to bitcoin abc. Bcash also seemed to launch shortly after the user activated soft fork which gave us segwit(2x-pending). Bcash increased block sizes to 8mb right off the bat and has a few other specs that i don't know much about because i don't care for big blocks before optimization.

It depends on what you could be worried about. I am mainly interested in BTC, but I am not selling my BCH as I'm not going to interact with any non-tested software, especially when it comes to using my seeds.
Regarding the arc of the fork story, here's my ELI5.
Enter scaling debate. We have one side who wants to increase thorough put without increasing blocks (Bitcoin Core, which developed Segwit), and the other side that only want on chain block increases (Bitcoin Unlimited/Bitcoin ABC/Bitcoin Cash). 
Segwit had been developed for over a year and has been activated on Litecoin for some time now, however, there was never consensus on integrating it into the network due to miner signalling. We were at a 2 year stalemate in terms of finding a solution for scaling so a *Bitcoin Improvement Proposal* (BIP 148) was recommended where instead of relying on miners to signal support, users would signal instead, hence the *user* activated soft fork (UASF). This was due to happen on Aug 1, 2017. 
As a response, Big Blockers announced a user activated hard fork, termed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which increases the block sizes to 8mb and a few other changes to the mining difficulty adjustment process. However, due to the lack of time to prepare for BCH launch, software may not be well tested, which can be dangerous.
What BCH does is effectively split the chain from Aug 1, 2017 and forward, however, it retains transactions before this date. So, if you hold BTC before Aug 1, 2017, then you ALSO hold BCH in the same amount without doing anything. The amounts of BTC and BCH are all located on your private key, and as long as you use software/exchange that supports BCH as well, then you have access to it. However, if you want to use a strictly BCH wallet, then be careful because you are exposing your private keys which ALSO contain your BTC. 
If you want access to both BTC and BCH, please first move your BTC using your private key to another location (hardware wallet, software wallet, another paper wallet) and then use the SAME seed to access your BCH and use it like an alt-coin. 
If you don't care, then proceed as normal. If you transact on the BTC network (using BTC, or using platforms which support BTC) then everything remains the same. The only difference is IF you want to access your BCH as well.

I said this on another thread, but rely on github. Check on the pulse and authorship of each project. This info is pretty good in helping me maintain confidence in core. They have the highest authorship (by 5x the next highest authorship) and you can simply ignore the mud slinging. I trust a project that's had sufficient peer review over 7 dudes or 1 dude releasing shit without sufficient notification to companies like exchanges. Electrum cash's authorship is even worse as the authors are anonymous.

I just read about coin join and I'm pretty excited about all these 2nd layer techs. 
For the uninitiated, coinjoin is not an alt.

This increases anonymity among the batch of users for best fungibility.

A huge boon of bitcoin is that you do not need the approval of any entity to enter the ecosystem. Like some comments have already mentioned, just download a wallet and you can IMMEDIATELY start exchanging your work for bitcoin. As long as you keep bitcoin AS bitcoin, you are likely able to avoid taxation. If you're curious, you can contact your German State tax authority, the Bundeszentralamt für Steuern. Chances are, they have not yet created taxation policy around bitcoin income and may only tax upon the sale of bitcoin, which would be capital gains. 
However, as long as you keep hush, there's few ways for the state to investigate into your bitcoin activities.

It's never too early to migrate your coins. Even old timers for bitcoin sometimes get lazy and leave coins on an exchange hoping to make a quick trade. Keep in mind that my philosophy about btc is long game only. My portfolio has only gone up as the years go by, but you have to ignore the every day price fluctuations. Never buy what you can't afford to lose, and ignore the price. Get it off the exchange and make sure you have key backups.

Vinny lingham(sp) is an entrepreneur from South Africa that promotes bitcoin but then went with ver et al. And signed the 2x agreement because "boohoo, toxic community and bitcoin core needs to be unseated because they have too much power". He is not technical, he is pure business, and resorts to wanting to keep promises to his business buddies than actually promote code changes that would be safest and most logical.

With the train of logic that he did a lot of work and therefore deserves to feel like he should be some authority, what about the dev team? Did they not create the very thing he promoted? The promotion would not have been possible without development, but development can still occur without promotion, even if it took longer.
No doubt he did a lot in the past, but let's not kid ourselves and think that it was an act of kindness on his part. He had gained from it as well.

The ecosystem is new enough that industry structures are just NOW building. These things take time. I would recommend researching a lot before just diving in. Bitcoin.org resources are legit.

Yes, the wallet has a browser extension to interface with but this allows it to bypass vulnerabilities of a contaminated device. The ledger doesn't speak to the computer at all. It speaks to the extension alone. 
As for you losing stuff, this is more a personal issue. Put the ledger somewhere safe and not with your other USBs.

Bip(s) = bitcoin improvement proposal. Each proposal changes a little bit of what the network (nodes /miners) is willing to accept in terms of transactions, or other forms of changes like changing activation at what rate of signaling (miners signal change readiness) . Bip91 reduces the signaling threshold for segwit activation, which means that a change in bitcoin that allows increased transactions per block can activate at a lower miner signaling rate (80%) vs the original activation rate (95%). This all means that miners may be now more accepting of segwit, leading to a decreased chance of a chain split, and less contention in the bitcoin space.

I originally worded this differently because I also, like you, think that this is suitable for people with basic computer skills. I am a mental health counseling therapist, so my competencies are certainly not in computers. I have the ability to read instructions and follow steps, but if it gets into technicals like requiring me to use hex or understanding the difference between root key and chain code, I do become confused. This psychological obstacle because a massive barrier to entry with many folks, unfortunately. I recall working in retail and people would not understand why a printer was not working because they did not clue in that they could *read the LED screen for instructions*. 
You're correct that there is a simplified experience on Armory. My reaction was certainly in response to a subjective assessment of the layman and their computer literacy/competencies. I may have less trust in their competencies than you do.

Through the signaling of miners or nodes. The signaling is simply some hardware running certain bip code. So a miner can be running Bip91 which bootstraps (requires) other bips , like bip4. If they run the program, then the network recognizes this as signaling. Once you achieve some rate of signaling for approximately 2 days (the network measures in blocks rather than time), then it activates or "locks in",or in your terms , is agreed upon.

If you use local bitcoins then make sure you're not dealing with agents and again, review the laws around money laundering in your jurisdiction.

Not sure what happened with my setup, but I attempted leaving Armory on and it stopped syncing at some point. When I restarted my computer, it was 2 weeks behind. I think it had to do with the block dir location, but I have limited technical knowledge so who knows.

 I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but my understanding is that transaction information has always been cumbersome. Segwit aggregates part of the signature (witness) and drops it from the transaction. Hence the name.

Newbs are scared of the price. People don't typically make near $2500 investments /purchases often. The fact that the bitcoin price continues to rise gives the impression that a "deal" or opportunity was missed, and people are averse to not getting deals. In addition, bitcoin is still an experiment, and most people's mentality is not in the long game. They always want to trade it back for "real money". Typical consumer or investor =/= rational actor.

Since the switchover to mBTC, I found that the volatility argument holds less weight. The fluctuations are no longer in $100's, but in $0.10's, which is normal/comparable to regular fiat commodity shifts. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:43:23
I hadn't considered that! I don't know about Coinbase, but other exchanges require ID verification before accounts can be used, which gives incentive to make larger buy orders in my opinion. But there is still that business risk to making the default unit of measurement different than the full BTC. So much psychology in market behaviour.

Just wanted to pitch in a bit about the volatility issue since it's brought up a lot. I am not an economist, nor have I ever taken an in class course in the field (mainly just online courses in banking), but it seems to me that this may be about perspectives. Bitcoin appears to be volatile because the asking rates are shifting constantly. Fiat doesn't do this. However, what fiat does shift that is not so directly communicated is its purchasing power. If you look at fuel rates, they are shifting on a weekly basis (at least), and annually, inflation makes it so we can purchase less with the same amount of money that we hold, and this becomes increasingly clear when we look at the global markets (different countries and their inflation). To me, this sounds very much like volatility, but presented in a different way than bitcoin. Essentially, the fundamental issue that people would be concerned with is volatility in purchasing power. So, unless I'm mistaken, bitcoin is not the only currency that is volatile.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:18:57
Perhaps it's not just inflation that's affecting the purchasing power to the extent that I'm considering. I'm looking at examples such as tuition, price of food, housing, etc. I'm not 100% on the forces that affect these rate spikes, but my essential argument is that fiat is not as stable on a mass level with regards to purchasing power as the arguments against BTC would suggest. Does that make more sense?
@_date: 2013-07-14 21:57:48
I think this is a good argument, but perhaps even more important is the fact that no one knew the ownership of the site was being transferred. Perhaps if there was an asterisk at the top indicating that hands were being changed, then the community would feel more understanding. However, from reading some comments, it doesn't seem like that's how things went down.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:23:34

[This]( g+ thread gives some information about where Nick Weaver stands regarding Bitcoin's fragility. It doesn't target EXACTLY what he means when he says it's "crazy stupid", but I think he's making the case that BTC can never integrate into the fiat monetary system.
@_date: 2013-07-14 23:08:16
Oh yes, absolutely. I think the owner is doing the best he can by being open, honest, and apologetic about the situation. I've never owned a site, nor am I much aware of how site management works, so I'm unable to say much about the foresight required to speculate on damage that can be done by selling a domain. If I were to guess, the initial reaction is "OMG someone wants my site for money?! FUCK YA!", but based on the amount of money offered and who was purchasing, it could turn into a "hmm..I wonder what they'll do with this site"? Perhaps I'm looking at it with a bit of hindsight bias, but I'm really just analyzing the community's reaction and less so the judgement of the original owner. 
Edit: too many guesses in one sentence.

I agree with the presumption of innocence, and though I agree that his affiliations does not NECESSARILY mean that he is for the things that I have suggested, but my "judgement" is not finalized. I do not think judgement is ever finalized, but with facts provided comes educated speculation. 
My speculation is probabilistic based on the tendencies of people who wield power. They tend to try and maintain power. His actions, being affiliation and promotion of CoinValidation, also support that assumption, no?

Though I understand ad hominem attacks are not condoned in most arguments, these particular tidbits of information are important to consider. This guy is trying to implement a system of "security" between BTC users/centralized institution. His character shouts "do not trust this dude, he has his own agenda" either political or otherwise. It's natural, based on looking at his affiliations, that he is not looking to equalize power, equalize wealth distribution, decentralize power/rule. Heck, he probably would vote against having the BTC code open source. Long story short, the stakes of BTC are high when people like Mellon emerge. This seems less an ad hominem attack than a PSA for the BTC community on someone who wants to rock the boat. An ad hominem in this circumstance could be considered if OP started saying "Mellon fucks fruit for fun" with pics attached, but what OP released is stuff relevant to Mellon's intentions as a potential BTC 'regulator'.
