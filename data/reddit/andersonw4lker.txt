Everything you write assumes everyone wants to pay for things in traditional currencies, with traditional methods of value determined by governments and financial institutions who control the world economy. It’s bitcoin it’s a global currency. You don’t have to value it in your “stable” dollar or anything else one bitcoin is worth one bitcoin not whatever price people are buying and selling it at that just an artificial price which is why it can fluctuate so rapidly.

You miss the point it’s a currency itself you only need to know its value in $ if you are converting it. If your not converting bitcoin then 2 btc is worth 2 btc it’s worth 2 btc when you send it to someone and worth 2 btc when it arrives and 2 btc 2 days later or 2 years later if you don’t convert it.

- Knows he has made a bad investment decision 60% loss 
- Believes the price will continue to go down. 
But is still holding.
You’re either quite stupid or  trolling.

BTC is measured in BTC. Do you measure your $US in GBP ?

So the price can go up and down $600 in a couple of days but it will take a life time to go up to $8000 ��
