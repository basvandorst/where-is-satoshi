I agree. I see this as the future. Everybody is yearning for change and this is very viable. BTC is still in the baby steps. I’m no veteran to crypto by any means, but I know revolution when I see it. Fuck the man and stick it to em!

Your mother disagrees.

Just to side on precaution, I would wait until after the 10th to see what happens with futures. It could see a good dip then you can buy low. J/s

So I'm a noob to crypto and made my first purchase on coinbase and its saying I'll receive my BTC in a week. How long does it take subsequent purchases to come through?
Edit add-on: Does it follow the network transfer times for each cryptocurrency respectively?

I reckon you're right.

Mmm salt

Awesome, thank you for the advice! I have my GDAX account set up as well, I'm just still learning how exactly to navigate/understand it. I'm not too worried about the transfer fees at the moment since I'm not investing huge amounts of money but no fees is definitely better! Also do you know of any good offline wallets for iOS?

Lol just hold, I bought in at 16.4k. Personally I hope it goes back down. Like, a lot. I want to buy more for cheap.

Not a good idea to tell people how much you’re invested. I know it’s fun to subtly brag and assert yourself, but it’s not smart.

You are smart.

I’m holding my balls now what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:00
Well would ya look at that, it’s back up.

If you’re afraid of losing it, you shouldn’t have invested it.
