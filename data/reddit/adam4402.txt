Lol, you appear to be even more suspicious than most BU developers.

I would rather know how to activate it.

Thanks! Finally useful answer :).

UASF Bitcoin installer is here:  (just download the "setup unsigned" version if you're running Windows and install Bitcoin client as usual)

I think miners don't care. They're actually profiting from this situation. You should rather contact your favorite Bitcoin service (exchanges and others...) to consider supporting UASF. Learn more at uasf.co and if you can, run pro-UASF node. You can download it here:  (just download the "setup unsigned" version if you're running Windows and install Bitcoin client as usual)

Thanks ;)

Advertise it. Obviously in a civilized and non-aggressive way.

I'm sorry but my vision of Bitcoin is different than yours. I think we should have censorship resistant and decentralized network for transactions ranging from few cents to millions. There are many solutions (Lighting, SegWit, ...). We just have to implement them. The Internet is also decentralized and revolutionized the transmission of information, but most people use it for watching cat videos and chatting about that handsome girl... You don't need such complicated and decentralized network for that, yet we have it.

Yeah, and then we have Litecoin and other altcoins, which just don't give a shit and are usable even for micro-transactions...
