getting government bailouts for defrauding the public. they shouldn't have received assistance for corrupting the system.
I don't know if you'd buy that, but yeah, when you logic'd me... I had to think deep about any ACTUAL crime they committed. Good job making me think.

This is NOT the democratic vision of "progress" 
In fact, the only people I've met who actually SUPPORT this bullshit are conservatives who are too old to understand how the internet works.
Best case, Feinstein is trying to appease the republican majority by hopping on their "Patriot Act" bandwagon that nobody asked for.
trust me on this. I've been called a "libtard" enough times to earn my "liberal wings." We are not for this bullshit.

They voluntarily paid 5.1 bn. They weren't even fined. If they weren't above the law, some very powerful people would have been arrested by now.

I use square to pay my monthly rent, and to pay debts to friends, and I ONCE got an email from Square saying "oops! We double charged you on accident, We are working with the bank to ensure you get your money back!"
If Square can do it, why can't Apple!?

You know how you're watching netflix, and sometimes its crisp and clear, and other times, it looks like a garbled shitmess?
That's how much is lost with UDP.
It'd take too long for netflix to make sure you receive every packet they sent by you sending back an acknowledgment. Because then they'd have to resend packets AGAIN. Basically all streaming services utilize UDP sends to keep up as much as possible. Its like they send packets over an extremely congested highway, crossing lanes without a blinker. "Good luck everybody else!"

Who are you? the UDP president?
You probably won't acknowledge that either...
