You just became a hodler
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:55:20
Well its true that it's more or less a one way street after people are done mining, but its going to be a while before there are 100mBTC left. More like when several countries get nuked.

I see that you have lost much money on an exchange, and i thank you for your contribution. I can tell you that as a succesfull trader, a good amount of that money went to me. I hope you do not mind. Let's hope you lose your anger soon and will give it a second try, just to lose your money again to us, the elite.
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:42:05
I mean, yeah. 7400 must be passed to go to 10k, so i guess its going to 7400 too.

Sell high, buy back for same dollar value. More bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-09-21 09:27:55
All you have to do is tell reddit that you sold, price will go up after that.
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:43:23
I bought something on a certain marketplace, some postcards. Was around 180 euros at the time, 5.5 bitcoin. Makes for a good story, but never did fomo.
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:31:46
So what are you trying to do on an exchange then? The money you will earn has to come from somewhere you know..
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:43:37
Someone bought at 17k and he is a little angry right now. Do us a favor and sell your stuff at 6k!

Why would you pay 26 for a 20 dollar code in the first place?
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:17:32
Selling them is not an option i suppose, only spending
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:34:22
About the difference between 500k and 1,5 mil. I'd say that's quite a difference.

There is no typing searchbar in payment method. Also search while selecting options would be a modern website-feature.
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:20:33
I know why; people sold.
@_date: 2018-10-21 19:24:15
And this is an example that runs on ~0.9% price increase. Much more price fluctuations happen around a 0.05%, the minimum fee on binance. This is the smallest increase for any profit, combine it with huge amounts of money and these 200 dollars multiplies with magnitudes. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:25:55
Are you saying im getting a discount to buy bitcoin in the coming days? I'll take it!
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:22:01
Assuming you sell straight away, yes.
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:24:46
You can apply that in the chart and what do you know, it's actually declining with the price of BTC: 
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:37:05
Because we are the end of a technical pattern, a huge triangle is coming to it's tip. It started around januari. Before next friday we will see a major market movement and you will have your volatility back. 
And for the whales: They will wait with pushing the market untill their buy or sell can break a support or resistance line. So far we are too far from them, but not for long.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:57:25
50/50, amiright
@_date: 2018-10-08 10:35:57
It's reddit, what did you expect? Memelords all over
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:21:43
The worst part: i left the overshot on the marketplace, i think around 0.2 BTC. Never took the effort of transferring it back to a wallet, since it was only ~5 euros.
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:42:20
Technically correct, the best kind of correct!
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:41:37
The best way is to buy low and sell high.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:01:45
You clearly don't get the idea of HODL if you are doubting the technique. Selling would be trading already, not HOLDING.
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:15:51
He's right you know, anyone with 4,5 million in bitcoin wouldn't be stupid enough to put that on an exchange. Private wallets exist for a (this) reason.

It depend on you how trade; hodlers have more use of the non log scale, as their holdings grow like the 'normal' chart.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:18:25
Just after i buy, thats when everyone can drive the price up.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:46:19
It's great you read all over reddit now "im considering quitting once and for all". It's the perfect buy.
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:38:55
So you are saying it bottomed out? Okay. i'll buy.
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:18:01
I can give you an address, if you deposit it there it will generate BTC all by itself, using a trading bot. It gives you back \~10% every month. Interested? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:33:28
It's to show them that it is not profitable, keep them busy so they don't bother others.
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:14:18
Its the most stable crypto there is actually, apart from the USDT

 Not so sure if starting a website selling drugs privately is such a good idea, let alone legal.  At some point this guy must have been like 'well there is a lot of cash coming in and my website is selling drugs, let's continue'. Seems pretty okay he's in jail, maybe not for so long tough.

Not how paper money works, your own country also has way more value in paper money than it has backed by gold.
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:29:54
We'll all be about 85k more poor.

Lets start this self furfilling prophecy:i bought.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:57:21
Calculating in percentages is very deceptive: 92% drop and 1500% increase appear to be very wide apart but they are actually not: 92% equals to a factor of 0.08, while 1500% relates to a factor of 16. Hence, these two values are only 28% (1.28 = 0.08 x 16) apart from eachother, not 1408%. So calculating like this is somewhat fair, but only if you keep buying the dips. It even assumes you knew and picked the lowest and highest point to buy and sell,

Tell me again how he bought 'physical' bitcoin.

Forward to 2021: 10 btc is now worth close to 1 mil. Everyone is trying to get into your passwords.
