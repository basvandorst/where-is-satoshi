BTC entire market cap is barely 50 billion dollars more than the largest hedge fund, Bridgewater. Look up the balance sheet of ICBC (the biggest bank in the world) for what a big bank is.

Im not trying to rain on your parade. You are free to do whatever you want. I just have never seen TA be a truly reliable way to trade with any accuracy.

Guys, moving averages are not some type of magical predictor. It is A MOVING AVERAGE. It simply reflects the AVERAGE of the past 200 days compared to the current price. Of course, it will *seems* bullish if the price is rising faster than the average of the past 200 days. But the price can reverse and slip under the MA. Just because it may indicate a recent quick upward price movement in the recent days/weeks, it does not mean the trend will extend for any period of time. This is my problem with Technical Analysis. There are lots of things to trade off : fundamentals, regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs, geopolitics, a long-term investment thesis. I think TA adds more noise that offering a clear signal. And as an investor, you want clear signals. Just my two cents.

A price being above a moving average just says that the price in the past days/weeks is higher than it was over the past 200 or 300 days.  Thats it. Maybe the price is now temporarily overvalued and it will fall and reset to a fair market rate? Maybe the opposite and there will be a bull market? There is nothing in the MA to price relationship that indicates a price will *continue* to go up based on past MA trend.

People are exiting alts for the safest crypto option. If BTC crashes after this, lot of players will exit the market completely. Its basically a sign of “our last hope in crypto is BTC” for investors.

The idea that “money” is completely founded on the idea of trust by all users of it. Bitcoin / blockchain is a perfectly “trustful”. It feels like crypto is an ideal evolution of money, better than any of its predecessors in history of mankind.

Blockchain IS inherently trustworthy. It is a decentralized ledger built on confirmed blocks reached by a consensus which requires no "intermediary" to settle or execute transactions. It is precisely the right monetary property to build incredible trust. 
I think crypto (BTC and others) just needs a bit more time for adoption. Then, people may find less reasons to go back to another form of currency of less...trust. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:42:40
I think the point he makes is that Trust is the foundation of money. “In God We Trust”, etc. Trust that your money will be accepted globally.  If people adopt Crypto, I cannot think of another form of money that people would so confidently trust due to the inherent way a blockchain protocol works. I can see how crypto will be an easier currency to ‘trust’ that fiat and viewed as potentially a superior currency as it gets more widely adopted.

I am crypto investor so dont jump down my throat. I own BTC, ETH, NEO, and ICX. 
Banks are not the enemy. This country was built on credit issued by banks. Some argue that "credit" is one of the most important inventions of all time. Credit grows small businesses / large corporate, builds towers, expands airline fleets, finances international trade and working capital, and tons of other things like. You may hate banks now, however, they made America and they do a lot of good for the economy.  
Also, there are Savings &amp; Loan Banks, Credit Unions, Thrifts, etc that serve main street, the middle class, and local businesses. Bank Deposits are one of the most valuable parts of an Asset/Liability Management for these local financial institutions. It helps them leverage their balance sheet (in a healthy, regulated way) to lend to local communities and offer low-risk products like C.D.'s to middle class who want to grow savings and try to out-pace inflation. 
Banks offer FDIC insurance. Crypto doesn't. Lose your private key and you are done. No lawsuits. No bailouts. Just evaporated money.
I like crypto but let's chill for a second with bashing banks. They offer credit to small businesses, private/public sector projects, and individuals who need it in ways that I think go unappreciated by a lot of crypto "enthusiasts".

Im looking forward to average joe doing the credit analysis for the municipal bond that needs to be issued for the new bridge being built through a major city. 
I believe in crypto for certain uses but banks and professional lenders to allocate credit to companies and projects are necessary. Ill change my opinion if someone can provide me alternative to things like issuing like loans to expanding airline fleets and working capital solutions. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:26:34
I appreciate the thoughtful response. My belief is that deposits are good because it gets lent out to where liquidity is needed. If my money is in crypto, that money is sitting idle on Ledger doing nothing for anyone. Credit is not being extended from that deposit. I really think this is one of the things that irks me about banks going away. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:15:48
Teaches me how good I am at ignoring my problems.

I wish this was the kind of conversation I could have instead of the dude a few comments down that told me to have sex with an inflatable George Washington.  
A lot of what you are describing sounds like the principles of asset allocation and portfolio management. I understand anyone would want to have cash as cushion in the event of a literal or figurative "fire". What you are concerned with is risk. Sure, your money as bitcoin on a ledger is safe and accomplishes exactly what you are talking.
Two points thought:
1) Regarding risk, FDIC - Insurance for your deposits up to 250K is a good policy that gives me a ton of confidence. That money is secure there and that "risk" doesn't bother me and should not bother anyone. That is insurance issued by a government whose treasury bonds has the highest credit rating on the planet and is the benchmark for all risk globally. Your cash on a ledger under your bed and your cash in FDIC insured account to me are equally risk-less. To argue differently is comparable to defending the construction of a doomsday shelter in your backyard. 
2) My concern is that Banks which have the expertise and responsibility to extend credit for all of the activities I previously mentioned in my other comments do not have liquidity anymore.  Those risk-less FDIC insured deposits grow their balance sheet and contribute to all sorts of economy-growing activities when that money otherwise would be sitting on an equally risk-less Ledger Nano under a pillow. 
Both are risk-less - but one is stimulating the economy.
This is my struggle -- unless I am missing something

What planet are you on where you think lending is a easy? Please look at a Prospectus for a Mortgage, Municipal Bond, or Syndicated Loan. 
Or just read start reading why Prepayment Models for mortgages exist.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:52:49
If banks disappeared how would a syndication or a lending facility needed (at that scale) like the link below be possible? That is a sincere question not rhetorical. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:01:28
Yeah, who needs a mortgage at competitive market lending rates anyway. Its called supply and demand. If half of the liquidity at a local mortgage lender is gone because it is sitting in digital wallets doing 0 when the same amount of people needing a mortgage exists what do you think will happen to your interest rates? Double?
These are the things I get confused by. Keeping all the money in crypto doesnt put the liquidity to work. I can only see rates going up for whatever is left in the banks because money is more scarce. Communities hurt. 
Again, prove me wrong and help me understand why my logic is flawed.
Crypto is a good technology with a lot of good uses but not the financial salvation I think people think it is.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:05:12
Exactly. This is why counterfeiting is such a punishable crime. This is why In God We Trust is written all over the bills. For the system to work, you need everyone to believe to maintain its integrity. Its not a bad or good thing. Its just the way it works....with many things in civilization.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:09:53
Time flies. While I agree 10 years is a long time, 2 years (to me) seems short. There are so many factors other than technological capability for something to be feasibly implemented. There are cultural components, public education and trust, and additional periphery services around the technology that need to emerge. I think crypto adoption is moving at a reasonable speed.  I think 2 years is aggressive but let's agree 10 is too conservative ;-)

Guys, bitcoin is one of many digital assets that will be used in the future. Its not THE one. Diversify.

This is horrible advice for any new trader. Seriously OP, take this down.

I think there are lots of things you described that banks can accomplish with DLT without touching BTC
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:14:31
Im going to say this as clearly as possible as a person who is long in BTC. I work in financial services closely with the innovation side. No financial institution is worried or interested in BTC. But there is huge interest in DLT.  Banks are sincerely interested in Ripple’s technology but could not careless about XRP.  Not every story about blockchain and payments innovations is an endorsement that BTC will moon or be widely adopted.

Im lucky cause I resigned that all my btc was gone about 6-9 months ago.  I just didn’t bother to sell so I’m emotionally at peace. Now its all just a party for me cause im back in the black baby.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:46:21
Dont stress yourself out! Bitcoin is not magic. Start by realizing that at its core blockchain is a decentralized database. The technology has a lot of uses that financial services (retail banking, insurance, corporate banking, etc) finds really useful as they try to build efficiency and mitigate certain risk.
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:15:09
I think BTC will stick around but I still have yet to see a reasonable way to value the damn thing after years of research. I cannot understand by 100,000 is something reasonable But, I do believe it is a digital store of value and the longer it sticks around, the more legitimate it becomes. And it has been over a decade... I genuinely have no idea but if I were a betting man.....no.  And I am HODLer
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:13:23
It should be clear by now that Bitcoin is only to be accumulated and held as a store of arbitrary value like gold or other precious metals and stones. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:08:21
BTC has no utility other than a potential store of value. You’ll never buy hamburgers with it. Also, no one provides any substantial fundamental analysis on BTC market price. People lean on aTA garbage which has failed them as recently as 48 hours ago. On the other hand, traditional fiat has so much soft-power utility beyond being an actual exchange of payment. When 1 USD is worth 3 whatever-foreign-currency that is important. No one uses BTC in their daily life other than to hoard it. At the end of the day, I firmly believe BTC will be akin to gold — little utility as a from of payment but remain a store of value based on whatever arbitrary consensus emerges for price.

@_date: 2018-07-13 01:07:17
Jesus christ — here we go again. Guys, lets also remember interest rates exist because there is a limited amount of money and there is a demand for money. People/companies need money. So if you have it you can lend it to them to someone else. How badly they need it — the higher interest rate they will pay.
Guess what guys, in the future if the entire economy is run on Bitcoin.... people and companies will still need loans. You will still need to get a mortgage. And you will need to pay an interest rate on that mortgage, even if your mortgage is paid in Bitcoin rather that USD.
