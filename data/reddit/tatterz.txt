The problem is is that me moving some of my BTC to Segwit is a $30-$50 fee.
[Seriously, why am I getting downvoted? Cus I don't like the high fees??](
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:45:47
Can you explain to me how to transfer them from legacy to segwit without the high fees, then? [Because I'm getting $37 as the lowest fee.]( I rather just not move them at all if thats the case.

I did. Everything made sense except that part. We never had a bubble that peaked to 650. Most recent bubble was 1200 and the prior bubble was 260.
I agree though, it certainly won't break 260 (without a major flaw in protocol) and I think the lowest we'll go (considering China rumor to be true) is $320, testing China's December 18th low. 
If China FUD is simply just FUD, we've hit the bottom.

Actually, using the martingale method and 2x profit payout, I have about a 96% chance of turning 6btc into 6.5btc hehe. 
Its pretty tempting. UGH.

Okay, lets say that bitcoin is the only currency used, world-wide. You get your paycheck in bitcoin. Whats to stop the IRS from taking a percentage of your bitcoin each paycheck, like they do fiat?

Sorry, a buddy MMS'd me this photo. Don't look at me xP
I just thought it was hilariously terrifying. Definitely scares me away from gambling my btc. When I have an urge to maybe try my odds, I put some doge on Doge-Dice and act like they're btc

They released  public announcements, but for a while the December ruling was considered a rumor. The 3rd pary payment was a rumor for a week or so, at first.
Shit is weird there in China. The PBOC might think they said all they needed to say in the December documents. Instead of making a new statement they tell the banks what they should do and its their job to act on it.

That Shrem reference is very fitting - They arrested him the morning of the NYC hearings...at an airport for "money laundering". Obviously, the setting was exactly perfect for the arrest. They tried to make it look like, to the mass media, he was fleeing the country or some crap.

This is actually good news!
It prevented someone from wiping the entire contents of my brothers Blockchain.info wallet. The theif's transaction eventually fell off and my brother immediately got his coins OUT.

You do know that is a $2 rise on practically zero volume. 
The market makes the news. Good news is good for long-term, but might only be a little pump &amp; dump in the short-term

I don't really think its rigged, honestly. The profit should be sitting close to 1% but its at 0.28% because of this whale who won massive amounts of coin. Its possible it could be rigged in order to gain back the coins that were lost though, IDK. 
I've been messing around on Doge-Dice and my W/L is 475/396 which may be pretty good luck since its suppose to be pretty even.

Back in December, China banned companies from accepting bitcoins as payment. They even banned the purchasing of mining equipment
The government is making it damn hard to buy and sell bitcoin and pretty much impossible to spend bitcoin. Its really not much more than a speculative investment over there.
A bitcoin ATM might be doable for a while but it would be pretty ballsy to implement.

It wasn't ghash that caused this dip. It was a long squeeze and some sells due to the silk road coins on the move. Ghash played attributed to the fud but not the lead cause.

silk road closure was in october.
On topic: Nothing really, a lot of people thought it was going way lower than the $64 bottom but $64 hasn't been seen since.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:19:54
I've been thinking something along those lines, as well.
@_date: 2017-03-04 06:29:33
Spending Bitcoin is essentially that. No different than cashing out to USD and buying something with it...It's even seen that way for tax purposes.

If you buy $10,000 worth of Bitcoin at $28 and it drops 90%, how is that different from buying $10,000 worth of Bitcoin at $13,000 and it dropping 90%.
It's not - you're still down $9,000. There's no difference.
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:28:11
The price of coin doesn't matter, it's the percentage that matters. The 2011 bubble was the biggest bubble in Bitcoin history.
@_date: 2018-10-06 10:11:10


omg you're more clueless than I even thought. If I bought $28 worth of BTC at the price of $28/Bitcoin, I'd have 1 Bitcoin. If I bought $28 worth of BTC at $20k/Bitcoin, I'd have 0.0014 Bitcoin. *If the price falls 90%, I lose the same amount of money regardless of my entry price. If I try to buy something with my Bitcoin, they've lost 90% of its purchasing power regardless of my entry price*
