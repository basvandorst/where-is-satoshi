Does not surprise me in the least bit.  Homero's number one objective is to censor and control information at any and all costs including using lawyers scare tactics threats etc.  If Paycoin was a country it would be North Korea and Homero would be Kim Jong UN.  *Looks like they got it back up but here's a screenshot for proof [WHILE IT WAS HACKED](

Don't worry I'll pay it forward to Mike the author of the article.  The only thing I'm looking to gain is saving people from losing their BTC to GAW.  I greatly appreciate Mikes work on this and I thank hardleft121 for his generosity.

Oh yeah how are those Hashlets doing now hows that zenpool paying out 1 satoshi a day doing for you.  Keep eating up those lies because when you shill like that you're just as much a criminal as Homero.

GAW are the kind of pepople that put things like this in their code, if you understand this then you know Paycoin will be the Zimbabwe of alt-colns:
33 / ( 365 * 33 + 8) = 0.00273790757487762382809259105617
Daily Rate * 350 = 0.95826765120716833983240686965901
Daily Rate * 100 = 0.27379075748776238280925910561686
Daily Rate * 20  = 0.05475815149755247656185182112337
Daily Rate * 10  = 0.02737907574877623828092591056169

Now that this post is linked through CCN I'm sure there will be a lot more downvoting but thats how the HashTalk community is.  Its kind of like North Korea if you don't go along with everything the dear leader says dissent is crushed instantly, shadow bans are very common also and that can be easily proven as some insiders are starting to talk.

["innovations"]( please enlighten me on these innovations and one thing you can do with XPY that you can't do with BTC.  Like I said before when I buy BTC I know i'm not making One man and his insiders rich and I will always have my Bitcoins under MY control nice and safe.  Other than highly inflationary what innovations are you talking about.

I seriously doubt it, but someone that has been scammed by GAW should contact someone to find out.  Everything they say needs to be cross checked with a reliable source.

You're right about them registering domains to try and stop you they (HashTalk GAW cultists) discussed doing just that [HERE]( (extortion!!!) in their celebration thread of your Blogs hack [HERE]( wish you luck in getting back to doing what you do best bringing us Crypto News!

They're just about to reel in their loyal GAWsters for one final money grab so they can keep the Paycoin turd afloat with their own credit debt.  [Final Plan almost in place](

I stopped using Coinbase a year ago when I found out I wasn't in control of my Bitcoin.  The whole point of Bitcoin is to move away from centralized banking.  Store and control your own Bitcoins its not hard.
