I decrypted all clues, so I'm sure I have many pairs and the order. But it miss me one pair to validate my theory. 
Have you idea ? Reward if it helps me
Thanks

Someone has an idea for the order of the pairs ? I'm pretty sure I have the pairs but I test many combinations and nothing. 
If I win I will reward if you help me.

Propose one pair
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:14:44
Why ?
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:36:00
Possible but it must pair with another word

Hi, how can I test the private key that I found ?

I think they are clues about the order in "To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot."

I know but there are still many possibilities. Need a pair with one of these word ; problem / tail / proof/ help / online. I don't know which one

"Lost transaction costs almost users" What does it means ?   
"Lost transaction costs" = fee   
"almost users" = ???   
What can be pair with fee ?
