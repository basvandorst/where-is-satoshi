Well as long as you didn’t get a rash, I think you cane out ahead.

Just put that money into Canadian pot stocks

That’s why you always stay in the game and never pull out...

Did you make money? If the answer is yes, then you made a good choice, don’t try and think of what ifs or the next time you invest you won’t make that choice and fail.

Or people will realize that you can’t purchase anything with bitcoin, so as currency goes its unstable and...well as a currency (which it was designed for) useless.

Someone finds 12.5 bitcoin every 10 minutes that’s 550 years to get the remaining 6million bitcoin? Mining it is one way, but obviously buying it is another way to obtain...I’m just more interested in how it’s valued...22million bit coin has now just created a false value of $440b. Ie what does big coin represent, some of it now represents cash as people have used current currency to purchase BTC...argh, I think I’m thinking too much.

I really need a ELI5 TL&amp;DR explanation of bitcoin, how it gets its value, how you can buy it and sell it and how the current cost can be justified.  I’m 36 have been trading since I was 18 but never ever followed crypto currencies as I could never wrap my mind around “miners” etc.  is there only $18mil Btc? Have they all been accounted for? So many questions.

What’s your end game then? If it’s an investment going from 20k to 400 would literally be worthless in terms of %.  Of you got in at the $400 level selling at 20k wouldn’t ever be thought of as a stupid move.

Sure you did...good purchase though

I don't think you have read anything regarding how apple pay works.  What you just described is currently how iTunes works. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:36:55
That's an option! You do not have to have a credit card stored on iTunes in order to own a iPhone, that's why a lot of people use gift cards instead. Once apple pay goes live you can delete your iTunes card/cancel it and then make iTunes purchase with apple pay...in the meantime, put an extra layer of foil on that cap.

Invest in Canadian pot...Aurora, radiant technologies, hemp (stock ticker is hemp)...easy double in less than a year...radiant tripple in last month.  WEED is also a good stock ticker as corona has interest in them.
