I was excited to see this and wondered why this wasn’t bigger news but then found out why. It just holds other stocks that might be associated or have a blockchain technology.
There’s IBM, SAP, and SBI holdings in there.
I’d say just buy the stock directly if you like it.
Some of these “blockchain” associations are weak at best.

Tried and got stuck a couple of times with an RPC error.
I believe my bitcoin.conf file does not even exist and needs some options set to allow lightning to connect to Bitcoin. Or possibly a permissions issue.
Also read about a cookie that bitcoin runs to avoid all the rpc username/password setup stuff but haven't had a chance to look into it.


Wonder if it's a PATH issue or something where there's a cookie file being set but lightning can't find it.
Any ideas on the missing piece? I know it has to be something pretty simple. Hopefully not SElinux or something OS side.

Man you got a LOT of reading to do.
That tired old "Bitcoin uses too much electricity," argument is played out and not even comparable. The right comparison there is the traditional banking system. When you throw in all the costs of the back end that has to support the infrastructure, it's not even CLOSE. On top of that, there are many coin systems that don't even need mining, which also cuts down on almost all of that energy consumption. 
So, the crypto universe continues to become more efficient with each new technology.
Now, outside of forced government regulation on the consumption side, tell me exactly what the oil industry has done to improve the energy consumption of their product? Anything?
Oil doesn't power Teslas, which by the way smoke any oil investment. So the two are not mutually exclusive. You can make money and have a better social impact by going with more environmentally friendly technologies.
Also I recommend the Bitcoin whitepaper which shows the problems with centralized monetary systems which broke the entire economy in 2008. Cramer literally personifies that old world thinking and is stuck in an outdated model.

Sorry one more question, if you don't have time or are tired of answering it's okay. I've researched this one a few times but can't come up with an answer.
Basically my goal is to change the rpc username and password.
So I did the following:
* Shut down lightning
* Shut down bitcoin-qt
* Changed the rpcpassword
* Restarted everything
But gets a username / password is incorrect error. 
Thinking about recompiling lightningd again and start a fresh instance to solve the issue but wondered if you knew of another config that I missed, either in bitcoin or lightning side.

@_date: 2018-01-12 19:17:21
Yep, it's good advice to invest in 19th century companies like GE that pivoted to oil and gas, their awesome 2017 stock returns show that. 
And 5 year oil returns have been absolutely AMAZING.
Take the opportunity cost of investing into oil vs. investing in crypto over the past 5 years and tell me which one comes out ahead.
Many crypto projects also are geared towards providing a better social impact. 
Oil, on the other hand, and its centralized control, have resulted in multi-trillion dollar wars over the past 100 years as world powers kill millions trying to control it. Environmentally, it's also a disaster. Companies like Exxon knew about climate change in the 1970s, and decided to suppress the information.
Face it, its time is up and it needed to be kicked out a long time ago, for alot of really good reasons.
Oil is moving sideways at best and becoming extinct at worst, relegated to a reserve energy source and consumer products basic material provider.
So investing in crypto not only has a better social and environmental impact, it also makes way more money. Like EXPONENTIALLY way more money. It's not even close.

OKAY HERE IS WHAT I DID
For anyone else may run into this issue.
I was trying to edit bitcoin.conf in $HOME/.bitcoin on the command line and it just wasn't doing anything. 
The reason for this is because I had moved my default data_dir to another filesystem since /home was just too tiny.
However, bitcoin.conf was missing on the other filesystem as well. 
Tired of guessing where to figure out where to put it, I just opened QT and went to the Options menu and clicked on Open Configuration File and pasted everything there. It will also show the path to where it is saving the file. (In a ../bin directory in my case).
Works like a champ now.
Thanks for all your troubleshooting, it's great to be a part of MAINNET

I was just going to add to it, if he can throw some sort of "all in memory" index solution in front of the node, that could speed things up even faster.
On a side note, I bet there's lots of room for improvement in most blockchain apps by throwing a memcached or Redis in front of many of these nodes. I know one project is using Redis, can't remember the name off the top of my head.
I think there's alot of untapped potential to tune up even Bitcoin.

I second this idea, have seen this as the highest throughput solution in most applications.
Tuning the data provider can sometimes speed things up, but it starts to choke when it scales under high loads.
Any application dev supporting the concept of parsing in and out, should be bought free lunch for the week. This method really does have the most dramatic effect on load and scaling, and it just requires a minimal amount of time, but saves ALOT of headaches and hardware.

This is hilarious. Bitcoin is on the threat level now for the central banks. The too big to fail banks tried to hold the line in January by cutting off liquidity flight into digital currency, but they are just stalling for time.
These old institutions need to either get on board or gtfo.
Recording industry example:
* Tried to fight digital music
* Won battle for a couple of years
* Rebellion gathered strength
* Steve Jobs co-opted digital music and created one of the most successful companies of all time, setting records in the middle of the worst recession ever
* Ironically recession above was due to reckless monetary policy
* Bitcoin created from the ashes of that Recession

The scaling issue is beyond obvious to anyone that's been in technology for a while. Database and storage are the absolute hardest piece in the entire stack to scale up. Other models (like TCP/IP that you mentioned), had already worked on solving scaling issues decades ago. This is nothing new.
A big monolithic piece of data is fine on a local machine, but when you are trying to ship its contents around, it gets tricky.
That's why you need an "agent" that represents the data to go around and quickly merge delta information on behalf of the storage.
Increasing blocksize is a bandaid, as noted many times. It would work fine on a LAN but trying to sync globally and simultaneously across thousands (eventually millions) of nodes just isn't going to work, period.
Vitalik also recognizes this and is why he is pushing sharding and plasma hard in Ethereum as well.
Lighting could become the global standard for scaling since it will be supported by many protocols include Bitcoin, Litecoin, Stellar, VTC, etc.
This also works with the TCP/IP analogy as back in the day there were also competing network protocols like token ring, IPX/SPX, Banyon Vines, but it wasn't until the world wide web came online that everyone needed to standardize on TCP/IP.

Thanks, I added the section below
* converttopsbt (Creator) is a utility RPC that converts an unsigned raw transaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.
* createpsbt (Creator) is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and outputs and converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is equivalent to calling createrawtransaction followed by converttopsbt.
* walletcreatefundedpsbt (Creator, Updater) is a wallet RPC that creates a PSBT with the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change to it to balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs that the wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only balance), UTXO information will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO information present, key and script information will be added which the wallet knows about. It is equivalent to running 
* createrawtransaction, followed by fundrawtransaction, and converttopsbt.
* walletprocesspsbt (Updater, Signer, Finalizer) is a wallet RPC that takes as input a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss it, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial signatures.
* finalizepsbt (Finalizer, Extractor) is a utility RPC that finalizes any partial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a fully signed transaction which can be broadcast with sendrawtransaction.
* combinepsbt (Combiner) is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It can be used at any point in the workflow to merge information added to different versions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the output of multiple Updaters or Signers.
* decodepsbt is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in a PSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.
**Low-level RPC changes**
* The new RPC scantxoutset can be used to scan the UTXO set for entries that match certain output descriptors. Refer to the output descriptors reference documentation for more details. This call is similar to listunspent but does not use a wallet, meaning that the wallet can be disabled at compile or run time. This call is experimental, as such, is subject to changes or removal in future releases.
* The createrawtransaction RPC will now accept an array or dictionary (kept for compatibility) for the outputs parameter. This means the order of transaction outputs can be specified by the client.
* The fundrawtransaction RPC will reject the previously deprecated reserveChangeKey option.
* sendmany now shuffles outputs to improve privacy, so any previously expected behavior with regards to output ordering can no longer be relied upon.
* The new RPC testmempoolaccept can be used to test acceptance of a transaction to the mempool without adding it.
* JSON transaction decomposition now includes a weight field which provides the transaction's exact weight. This is included in REST /rest/tx/ and /rest/block/ endpoints when in json mode. This is also included in getblock (with verbosity=2), listsinceblock, listtransactions, and getrawtransaction RPC commands.
* New fees field introduced in getrawmempool, getmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants and getmempoolentry when verbosity is set to true with sub-fields ancestor, base, modified and descendant denominated in BTC. This new field deprecates previous fee fields, such as fee, modifiedfee, ancestorfee and descendantfee.
* The new RPC getzmqnotifications returns information about active ZMQ notifications.
* When bitcoin is not started with any -wallet=&lt;path&gt; options, the name of the default wallet returned by getwalletinfo and listwallets RPCs is now the empty string "" instead of "wallet.dat". If bitcoin is started with any -wallet=&lt;path&gt; options, there is no change in behavior, and the name of any wallet is just its &lt;path&gt; string.
* Passing an empty string ("") as the address_type parameter to getnewaddress, getrawchangeaddress, addmultisigaddress, fundrawtransaction RPCs is now an error. Previously, this would fall back to using the default address type. It is still possible to pass null or leave the parameter unset to use the default address type.
* Bare multisig outputs to our keys are no longer automatically treated as incoming payments. As this feature was only available for multisig outputs for which you had all private keys in your wallet, there was generally no use for them compared to single-key schemes. Furthermore, no address format for such outputs is defined, and wallet software can't easily send to it. These outputs will no longer show up in listtransactions, listunspent, or contribute to your balance, unless they are explicitly watched (using importaddress or importmulti with hex script argument). signrawtransaction* also still works for them.
* The getwalletinfo RPC method now returns an hdseedid value, which is always the same as the incorrectly-named hdmasterkeyid value. hdmasterkeyid will be removed in V0.18.
* The getaddressinfo RPC method now returns an hdseedid value, which is always the same as the incorrectly-named hdmasterkeyid value. hdmasterkeyid will be removed in V0.18.
* Parts of the validateaddress RPC method have been deprecated and moved to getaddressinfo. Clients must transition to using getaddressinfo to access this information before upgrading to v0.18. The following deprecated fields have moved to getaddressinfo and will only be shown with -deprecatedrpc=validateaddress: ismine, iswatchonly, script, hex, pubkeys, sigsrequired, pubkey, addresses, embedded, iscompressed, account, timestamp, hdkeypath, hdmasterkeyid.
* signrawtransaction is deprecated and will be fully removed in v0.18. To use signrawtransaction in v0.17, restart bitcoind with -deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction. Projects should transition to using signrawtransactionwithkey and signrawtransactionwithwallet before upgrading to v0.18.

I’ve seen other platforms do it on a sliding scale where the non-accredited investor was only able to invest a certain % and that was based on their income and net worth.
That way we don’t have situations like modest income earners buying 5 houses, but it doesn’t leave potential participants on the sidelines.
The problem with the accredited investor rules is its an all or nothing limit.
Was that limit picked arbitrarily? Or was it based on risk management the way insurance industry does it?

I don’t share the disdain for ETH like a lot of posters here, but I will say that syncing ETH absolutely requires an SSD, unlike Bitcoin, that can do it on low end hardware like you did.
Geth nodes will get to 99% on traditional HDD and then get stuck, ETH devs themselves have documented that an SSD is required. I believe this is more about the architecture of the local node itself than the blocksize. They’ve invested a considerable amount to tuning up the base level 1 layer.

The popular opinion in the cryptocurrency subreddits, especially on is very negative towards Robinhood.
I am going to disagree with the popular sentiment here and say it's not a bad way to get your feet wet. Buying there helps drive support of Bitcoin, and it makes things easy for beginners so you don't have to worry about things like private keys, backups, or misplacing things.
Now, the reason Robinhood is met with so much hostility here is because it goes against the whole idea of Bitcoin, which is to be your own bank. If you have your own wallet, your Bitcoin cannot be confiscated or lost by a third party.
Another alternative you can look at is Square's Cash app, which is also an easy way to buy Bitcoin, but lets you send it to another wallet to take full possession if you want to.

Is there a power saving feature that's shutting down the HDD? You might be able to just change a setting to keep it from shutting off and stay with your setup without having to buy anything new.
External HDD should be fine to run a Bitcoin node.
Also make sure to tune up your dbcache setting to 80% of system memory in Bitcoin Core software and restart it before syncing, it should speed everything up.

Good point, these blocksize controversies have too much religious drama, would be good to focus on scaling layers 2 and 3

With respect I must disagree and think that insurance will not only be a wanted product, it will be absolutely huge.
There are many layers of insurance built into the existing financial workflows. As bloated and unnecessary as that sounds, it sets a certain expectation from the population. Insurance companies, for example, have reinsurance backing them up. Defense in depth.
The *technical* precautions you mentioned will work, but unfortunately 99% of the population is going to have no idea how to do any of those things.
It would be like never having a data backup, common sense and unthinkable for a technologist, but overlooked by most.

What you could do is set the dbcache temporarily while you sleep, then when it's done synching, you can set it back to the default to give all the RAM back to your desktop.

I don't blame them for hating the current setup.
Many of them are graduating and finding a very hard time finding work, even with a good work ethic and solid credentials. I am personally seeing alot of college kids get hired on at jobs they are massivley overqualified for.
They deserve a new a system and I'm glad to see them being the ones to upend the existing one and lead the way.
Many of the gatekeepers now, when they were same age, had it easy. Let's be honest about that. You could get a college education for very low cost, and I know multiple stories from that generation, who paid for their college simply by working summer jobs at factories.
When they graduated, they literally just had to show up with a degree and they could get work. And investing, heck if you just buy and held, you would make a fortune simply by just being in the market.
Kids today have to deal with the following: 1) a terrible job market (even with full employment, the quality of jobs is much lower than in decades past. 2) skyrocketing, immoral financial burden of educational loans 3) ridiculous housing prices 4) shrinking wages due to global workforce competition

This has nothing to do with protecting consumers, and has more to do with protecting market share.
The bank does not loan out "their money," they are just a custodian. They reuse their customers' savings accounts along with direct access to the Fed for their own low % loans, and make money on the spread or by reinvesting borrowed money.
Banks and entrenched credit cards (VISA, Mastercard) are running scared, and putting up barriers to entry to try and protect themselves.
Banks need to wake the f up and get on board, they'd make way more money in the long run instead of fighting it.
By the way, CFTC guy said in his testimony that crypto actually has 3 characteristics, not just money -- it's a commodity, a store of value, and a currency, all in one. 
Embrace providers like Square who are working with crypto and not against it.

There are lots of great ICOs out there changing the game for the better, to label them all as cancer isn’t thinking it through.
How is this any different than Kickstarter, Kiva, WeFunder, Prosper, any other crowdsourcing website, the VC game, credit default swaps, banks that use your money to make more money, or just printing money?
Look at rootproject, which has a goal of fundamentally changing society and uplifting a whole set of the disenfranchised, by creating a new incentives model that never existed before.
Yes, you have stupid scam projects like Paragon, and you have shillers manipulating the market on questionable projects like Walton, but that’s what happens when you have a new paradigm.
For every Amazon there’s going to be 9 Pets.com.

I wouldn't mock the fusion machine. Apple and HP both started out of a garage, Facebook (I don't like it but 2 billion users is no joke) started by a college kid in his dorm room.
The Space Program had its roots from a bunch of German hobbyists out in parks launching the same rockets you can buy from the hobby store.
And we all know Bitcoin was started by a whitepaper.
The two investments I went in already had double-digit revenue growth and were profitable before going onto the site. For them, the issue was just getting the funding to scale up.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:33:01
LOL, JP Morgan [absolutely did need that bailout money]( 
Goldman Sachs gives this same tired old line too. In Goldman's case, they not only got bailed out by the Feds, they also got bailed out by Warren Buffet, who not only offered his name to stop the bleeding, he got a ransom deal with stock options AND a huge dividend attached to it.

I wouldn't say billionaires are clueless, unless they had their wealth handed to them (heirs, House of Saud, etc.). Many were absolutely brilliant for their time.
However, time moves on and wealth building strategies that may have worked decades ago, may now be commodity businesses with no chance of being lucrative.
This is like the Maginot Line in France, a brilliant idea and well-built, but 20 years too late, and completely brushed aside by the Lightning Network. I mean, lighting tactics of combined arms, mobility, breakthrough, and exploitation.
There are many old school guard who get it, you see names like McAfee and Tim Berners-Lee in the game, but often former thought leaders are in a different paradigm, and have made their money and don't get it, and also complacent/comfortable so unable get hungry enough again to even try it.

When subpoenaed by the Feds, they printed out all documentation and handed over billions of physical papers. How they got away without obstruction is beyond me.
They also claimed they would have survived the Recession without Warren Buffet and the Feds literally bailing their scumbag azzes out.

Really it depends on how he is using his real machine and what resources he has available.

They were also the key factor in the 2008 meltdown when the world economy literally locked up, as companies were unable to get credit when the bond market crashed.

Again we're making alot of assumptions about what the original poster is trying to accomplish.
There's also the case to be made for centralizing too much into VPS providers like AWS, Digital Ocean, Alibaba, etc., and why we need more nodes outside of those.

I would move the wallet to cold storage, or if you need to, you can put your wallet on a VM, and then just turn the VM on whenever you need access to the wallet, that way it's not sitting there broadcasting that port for anyone to sniff until the VM is on, and it's also encapsulated inside of the host to obfuscate things a little.

Must respectfully disagree, though I understand where you are coming from.
The foreign exchange thing does suck but taxation guidance is quite gray at the moment and it's better to stay on the side of caution, especially if you're a registered CPA. 
Say the IRS comes after the CPA, he can't claim ignorance or lack of clarity in the laws.
There's alot of this "oh the IRS won't care or find out," advice going around Reddit, and have to say it's pretty bad.
Feds are the absolute worst entity to make mad. You cannot and will not win against them, once they get their sights on you.
I agree fully that the tax laws right now in crypto are terrible but better to stay cautious, yeah you can save a few bucks and some time by not filling out the form but the potential downside is enormous down the road if you made the wrong gamble.
I also think the comment is misdirected against the tax preparer, when it should be used constructively to advocate tax law changes themselves.
There was a lobbyist group on here a few weeks back trying to do just that but they got a really hostile reception.

I originally invested into Square because their growth rate was ridiculous, nothing to do with crypto, so even without it, they are still a solid pickup.
Once Visa started getting hostile towards crypto, I dumped them and used the money to double my investment into Square.
There are quite a few disrupting payment processors out there, like Clover, for example, and they can offer more competitive rates for merchants, but I think Square has the end to end process nailed down pretty solid and the customer experience is an excellent package.
Overall though the crypto investment is just icing on the cake and Jack Dorsey is supporting Lightning Network directly so should be supported.

Too much anti-Windows tribalism in here. Thanks to those that helped him out with finding a solution.
88% of the world [still uses Windows on the desktop]( so bad mouthing them just hurts adoption.

Yah, last week was mostly, "man, f it, I'm turning off Coinmarketcap now and not going to look at it anymore."
For some, that can be signs of capitulation. 
People are chilling out alot more and not looking for the next greatest thing that will push the market back up.

Great job guys, I read the whole thing and glad to see people pushing the technology ! This type of online chatter with random strangers is very reminiscent of the OP's first post where he talks about the evolution of online collaboration, very garage-roots feel to it, when things are the most exciting.

Lots of dumb political crap in here. 
But let's get real. Iran government sucks but that's a sad result of western governments directly interfering back since WW1 times. So you can understand why it's so defensive, especially considering how their neighbor got knocked over recently and destabilized, and also how the West is also closely allied with their number 1 arch enemy in the region Saudi Arabia. (Who are the *real* assholes that blew up the World Trade Center).
But let's not put that on the people of Iran who are stuck in the middle of these ridiculous power games, and ironically are very friendly towards the West and natural allies if anyone would ever wake the f up and realize it.
However, anyone from the West considering moving to Iran to setup shop, is a pretty terrible idea.
* 1) The West is not going to like you setting up *anything* involving freakin **cryptography**
* 2) The Iranian government is going to feel free to use you as a pawn against your own government and seize your assets at any time
Really if you're from some place like Russia, China, or some neutral country, this could work but pretty dumb idea for anyone else !

Another person could argue some of the original Cypherpunks were anarchist if we wanted to put people into structured boxes. Others were the idealist type I am talking about. And yes, there were Libertarians among them. Someone even argued some they were anarcho-communists.
We could go on and on with the labels.

Yes, and it's beyond obvious. 
They were also easy to spot during the bull run, when they were in shill mode and running up specific coins.
I mean seriously, we had coins releasing a weekly dev update, and posters claiming it was so awesome they were *crying* over it.
Now we are in the bottoming process, it's easy to spot the FUDsters. Not going to mention specific coins but there's another project under attack this week as well.
When you see a thread run up over 100 responses in a couple of hours with very strong opinions, you know what happened. This crap is *not* organic, it's 100% staged, coordinated, and fake as hell.

For me I have a different take on it being apolitical -- it's not owned by the "Libertarians," or the "Progressives," it's apolitical and is something that goes beyond the normal drawn box lines of those outdated constructs.
