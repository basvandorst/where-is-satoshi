I would argue that Brooklyn is way closer to Brooklyn than Stamford is.  As long as you are not taking public transportation, of course.

Roses are not all that expensive here, it's the delivery.  I have paid $40 for a morning order to be delivered before 5pm before.

We already knew what a Bitcoins was.

Probably done intentionally so you can see the DELL logo being the right way.

Depends really!  If it's voluntary you can get as crazy as you want.  GPS with a text message to confirm, or even compare GPS with known tower location.  Hell, use the camera as an ID?

Oh wow, keychain makes so much more sense.  Also I think we have a habit of selling the user short.  Most are hip and willing to learn, but some others slip through.  I have done no research with this, though.

Comcast has lawyers and precedent protecting them.  Also, the only thing worse than downloading CP is being falsely accused of doing so.

If someone does not trust what reddit says about their privacy policy--and privacy is actually a concern--than this conversation is irrelevant because they should have been protecting themselves from the go.
To answer your question though, I was just posting some relevant information from the announcement that sheeps like myself may find interesting.
