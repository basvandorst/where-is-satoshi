Yeah, I was prepared.  The clerk was not.  She had to pull out an iPad to complete the transaction.  I think she was using Bitpay, but I am not sure.  All she had to do was punch in the amount owed, and a QR was displayed on the screen.  Had my wallet open ready to send, scanned the code, signed a receipt (don't know why I had to sign anything, but I was ok with it) and I was out of there quickly.

We were chatting so I did not take out my stop watch to time the interaction.  The sales associate was very nice and she was impressed at how easy the transaction went too.  In fact it went quicker than the lady in front of me who was fishing her wallet out of the black hole that must have been her purse.

Not having to deal with your identity being stolen when using it online is a HUGE plus.  Have you ever had to fix that?  With bitcoin, you don't need to have your private data out on the internet as much.  It can limit the exposure of your personal details.  Your spending patterns are no longer logged and mined by your credit card processor either.  There is a ton of infrastructure out there that captures, records and profiles you and your habits based on your credit usage.  I find it easier to use, and I will never have an account maintenance fee with it either.  It does require some care and thought, but all financial matters do.

Funding my hobbies.  Technology, Precious Metals (I like me some Silver) and Gardening.  What I do like is not having to enter my credit card number anymore on web sites that accept BTC.  There is comfort there.  The least amount of times that I do this on the internet, the better IMHO.  The places where my credit card information is stored are reducing in number, which lowers my risk profile there...while simultaneously increasing my risk profile in using a highly volatile digital commodity.   I usually buy a little bit more than what I spend on the same day I make the purchase.

Actually I am taking a class at Microsoft in Cambridge, which happens to be next to MIT.  I had heard about how MIT had given Bitcoins to the incoming freshman, and that the campus store was accepting them.  It was convenient for me, so I tried it.  I repurchased from Coinbase right away too.

My phone did do a recent software update.  I hard reset it twice, and everything was back to normal.  I was wondering if it was a display issue, and it was having a hard time loading the transactions.  All is good.  Remember to backup your wallets!

I know the owner.  I am sure he will laugh at it, and probably not understand it.  It is surely an opportunity for him, but this is a very rural part of Rhode Island and there are a lot of "swamp yankees" here, so there is probably not as much utility or interest in the next generation of finance and money, just yet.  There still is a barter economy around here.  I will be sure to replace it, and stop in from time to time to see if the key gets swept.

Yup.  That is where it was.  I will post mine elsewhere to make it a hunt.  1 beer.  Thanks!

There is gold and silver,  and   This will be the new exchange.  Imagine a world where there is no central controlled currency.  It is what it is, no exchange rates, it's flat.  Scary new "rush".  BTW, I am available to anyone who needs to talk privately about this gold rush (shameless plug).  This first interconnected "world" currency IS pretty exciting.

I foresee an escrow service tied to a shipping confirmation.  The entity that delivers the goods sets the state to delivered, and notifies the escrow to release the coins.  It would not be too hard to implement, and we already have tracking numbers and can see when things are in a delivered state.  Just need to tie it together.

The truth here is that if one had paid in BTC one would not have volunteered ones personal information.  I for one would love to have just scanned the QR, and have been on my way.  You have me on camera, and I paid you.  Are we good or do you require something more?  I'll shop elsewhere when "you" clarify your policy...or start accepting Bitcoin cause someone else will.

Sure, I think cash is great.  It is just inconvenient.  Having a digital safe harbor like bitcoin that allows for a pseudonymous transaction just like cash is great too.

Scary to think that the telecom companies can really filter this out on the network.  They may not be able to stop it all thanks to some brilliant people, but could dampen the speed.  The British already have a "porn" filter from what I hear.
