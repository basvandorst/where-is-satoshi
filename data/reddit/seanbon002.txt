Vertcoin is ASIC resistant, uses Lyra2v2. Only being mined by desktop GPUs.

Where do you put the USD? Under the mattress?

Cause segwit. They refuse to just add segwit. They are waiting for something before they do but it's taking forever that I finally gave up and used a different wallet for segwit btc transactions.

Canadian here. Yes it works perfectly in Canada. I've been using it for  awhile now.

This is great. I will be prepared for the next one and have a good suggestion.

Still to expensive imo. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:29:08
It works. I use it almost everyday in Canada

I exclusively use fold app at Starbucks now in Canada. I can't go back to not getting 20% off

Nice. Does anyone know of the best paper to buy to print your own stickers? Nothing I have found so far has the nice classic glossy sticker look.  
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:38:24
interesting. Cool idea for sure.

Andreas was on a live London Real show last week that I am waiting on to be put up. I wanted to watch it live but missed it. 
Brian Rose the host of London Real has been into Bitcoin for a few years now. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:03:28
This is true. I have actually started going to Starbucks more again since using fold app. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:33:45
You have 18 connections which means your public. Anything over 8 would indicate public.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:49:13
Agreed. Tried greenaddress a couple different times and just ughhh. Horrible. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:29:13
Wish they made an iOS app
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:06:03
That's still a no go to me. No update and no segwit. My receive address still starts with a 1 and no option to create new wallet or anything like that. (This is on iOS)
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:18:02
Try closing the wallet software and restart it. I’ve had this happen where it doesn’t update the info... had this happen with Vertcoin wallet on my ledger nano S as well. 
I came back to see 6+ confirmations. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:00:03
I've used foldapp for Starbucks. Really easy and straight forward. 20% discount. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:52:22
Do you really need to login with Twitter to use this? 
@_date: 2019-09-13 04:11:49
Hmm talks about bitcoin privacy. The website does not have ssl :(
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:10:41
Awesome. Looking forward to this 
@_date: 2015-04-10 23:01:55
Alternatively does the email option work the same? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:31:31
Also less humans needed in boring mundane jobs. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:42:17
$400 for that? GL with mass adoption. Would be nice if it was At least  in a proper computer case or finished better... Ya it's got a bunch of stuff pre installed but the hardware... 
@_date: 2015-04-12 00:19:03
Just used it in Canada. Really easy and quick. Thanks. Look forward to the apps

How do you view it on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:12:05
I've been using this in Canada for a couple weeks now. Works perfectly. I love seeing the realtime 20% savings. 
The barista said I had $1.19 left on my "Starbucks card" but when I looked down it updated to $1.56 left :)
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:23:42
Foldapp has replaced my Starbucks card completely. I did some quick math to see if the 20% off from foldapp was better then the free drink I get from my Starbucks card for every 12th purchase. 
Even when my free drink is an expensive fancy one it still works out better to use fold app.

All that debt is used as currency in the economy. Without that debt you have no money supply. There will always be more debt owed then money in the supply. 
And they have the nerve to suggest Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme...

This is how I bought the culture high 2, the internet's own boy and some other docs straight from Vimeo. Fantastic way to do it. Drm free downloads, and stream able from Vimeo.com anytime and available from day one.
I was really disappointed not to see Citizen Four for sale on Vimeo or another place drm free. Unless I'm missing somewhere..
