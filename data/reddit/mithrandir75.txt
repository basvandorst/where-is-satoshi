Looks like they realized their error and corrected it.

Hi,    
Thanks for your questions. No, tea is not grown in New Hampshire unfortunately. Tea is grown mainly in subtropical to tropical climates and New England clearly doesn't qualify :) . We are members of New Hampshire Made because we order our tea from an importer and package it here in New Hampshire.   
We actually do have an Earl Grey tea [found here]( ! It's delicious and the white blossoms mixed in help to smooth out the often bitter aftertaste.

Thank you for the suggestion and pointing that out.  I hadn't considered that.  So far our orders with BTC have been light, but I'll look at this anyway in anticipation of growing.

We do not plan to stop!

I just used Google forms to list out instructions.  Feel free to take a look to get an idea.  As demand to purchase with BTC increases I'll likely get more sophisticated... Or try at least..

We actually get that question a fair amount from people who aren't joking.  I used to also work occasionally with a friend at his local coffee business and people used to ask us where in NH he grew the coffee.  Most people have no idea where food comes from...

Sorry you had problems with the mobile site. If you were trying to pay with bitcoin you cannot order through our regular cart system. You need to go to [this page]( and follow the instructions. This does work somewhat like a mail-order catalog, so it may be helpful to write down your order and size of the items before proceeding.

This news really hit me hard, and just when I thought the market correction since January was bad enough.  Well, it's been fun everyone, but I guess I'll be selling now and packing it up.  This sub will be deserted within the month, no doubt.  Try to cheer up everyone as best you can...I know it's hard in light of such depressing news.....
