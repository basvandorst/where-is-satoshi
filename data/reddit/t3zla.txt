Keeping a physical, unencrypted copy of his website activities was a terrible idea regardless of whether or not there was personal info inside of it.

I do always feel like i am committing a crime when I deposit $1000 into a random person's account where I do not know their name, number, or even the state they are in.

I would agree with you if you were not being retarded and trusting coin base with your funds. Download electrum for fucks sake.

Guys localbitcoins.com is amazing. It takes me 15 minutes to run to the bank and make a deposit and then I instantly have bitcoins in my wallet.

I want to use mycellium for convienence but there are not as many traders as localbitcoins. It is a vicous cycle :P

While there are other (very sucessful) markets, the problem with them is that they are still centralized and only run by one or two people each. The owners could still run off with the money, still get arrested, and still get their servers siezed or shutdown. OpenBazaar is decentralized so none of those things could happen. It would be virtually indestructable

Weed *bowl* not bowl of *weed*

Both of the markets have their ups and downs. Just use the one that your vendor is on. Agora has terrible uptime and evo has been known to delete bad reviews per vendor request

Yes but that was *pure* coke going back onto the streets instead of stuff already cut with lethal crap.

As long as it's good shit I don't care who it comes from. I haven't been arrested yet
