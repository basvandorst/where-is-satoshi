The best way always is dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:25:09
If your looking for a real answer it could go to $0.  But if litecoin is around 20-30 dollars it's a bottom.  I'm buying at 4400 then seeing a consolidation then to 3100-3000.   Call me nuts been called it alot... but I'm a conservative.  Dollar cost average buying is the best way to go.  Next bull run goes to 60-100k ( if that comes which I believe it will ) pick and choose your battles.   Think long term cold storage like 50 below cold.. that is looking locked for four years.

Never tell anyone how much btcs you have! Buy a cold storage.  Welcome to the shop show! It's time for btc to make the bottom or rollercoster Down
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:16:27
Guys I want you all to understand the psychology and timeline of how the last bear markets ended.
1. Find a market bottom and test the 20 weekly moving avg
2. Test bottom a second time to find support and confirm bottom.
3. Break above 20 weekly moving average and test 50 weekly moving avg. Only to be rejected.  
4 have a false break down and have a golden cross getting above both averages.
5.  From first time finding market bottom and golden cross needs to be a significant amount of time (250-270 DAYS).  
6. Follow the break out and final capitulation candles have to have massive volume.
It is critical we confirm the bottom at least twice and this phase happens over a extended period of time.  This allows for the mentality of moon boys vs whales and weak hands selling to stabilize.  
So if you thinking we're going to 10k in a month there's your dose of truth.  Crypto winter is here to stay for awhile. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 03:17:05
Cipher IDK about you but buying at 6,600 is much better than 20,000.

It's actually a Fibonacci fan with a descending triangle. between the 21-23 is probably our next big move.  Everytime btc "bounces it hits a fib retracement level also" but I guess that has nothing to do with  the price either.��  While we are both correct though both do move the market.
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:12:23
Should include something like...
Please watch the documentaries Banking on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Beyond the Bubble....
The easiest and safest way to buy is through coinbase.

So my parents got divorced and my dad has to pay my mom XX amount of money per month.  Well lately the payments are not syncing with the dates that it is coming out of his accounts long story short both complain about the time involved with snail mail for paper checks...... and complain about wire transfers costing $40 through the bank (different banks and different states).  While I try to calm down both of them via phone in the back of my head in still laughing about the day I told them about btc about 6000-6500 in the previous bull run. If the gave it the time of day they would understand the power of btc and why they don't need a bank or paper checks.  I've told them many times and just gave up the "laggers" in adoption of this tech are not my problem.  Love them both but you can't fix stupid!

The fomo is strong with this move.  But most technical signs are bullish in macro trends. Micro trends are showing over bought.  If you not buying now you're a idiot.  60+% the bear market is over now.  May see a pull back for support anything above 3200.  I'm bullish a.f.

So my friend Bitcoin and I started working on this car and recently its been pushing about 8000 hp.  But this fool, Bitcoin, isn't happy.  He's in his shop right now working.  I'm talking headers, cam, turbo.  Out of his mind! I'm just sitting there drinking my beer laughing, "YOU CAN'T GO OVER 8500 BRO!  Just take a breather your not ready!"  I just checked up and this psycho is headed to the race track and it barely runs! Needs to be tuned and new tires!   He keeps whispering, ".... this one... is... for dad...."  God, I hope satoshi is watching !!!  He's going up to the starting line.  Luckily it won't stay running!  Oh Sh\*\*! He's in the burn out box with the tires blooming smoke!   "BITCOIN STOP! You're CRAZY!"  
Bitcoin: "THIS IS GOING TO THE MOOOOON OR I'M THE CHALLENGER!"

It's just the network valuation is overweighing the value of the value being transmitted on the network.  It would be the equivalent of a p/e ratio of a stock.
