Fuck you.  No.  If they wanted to know who they were dealing with they should have asked when I set up the account.  Not after i've been using it for years. You don't do business with someone and then randomly hold their funds hostage and change the terms of service.  That's fucked up.  If you think that's normal then you're fucked up.

These, but mostly the effort required to do the research to answer these questions.  Most business people have been successful because they stuck to what they know.  For somebody who understands bitcoin and has used coinbase, it's a no-brainer, but I can't even count the number of things I avoid in my life  solely because I'm unfamiliar with it.

they aren't a bitcoin company.  That'd be like calling Reddit a bitcoin company just because they accept bitcoins
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:45:21
It's just a step towards wider adoption.  As people realize that they can use bitcoin more places, they become more willing to accept it for more things.  
Short term, no it's not going to bump the price. But wait till this summer when Tiger Direct and Overstock give their employee's the option of receiving paychecks in bitcoin, or the ad agencies they use start accepting bitcoin and then there's incentive to hang on to some of that bitcoin instead of losing money on exchange rates.
The strength of a currency comes from the confidence people put in it. Confidence isn't going to sprout up overnight

You might try bitfinex, they have a .1% deposit and withdrawal fee ($20 minimum, only on USD crypto deposit and withdrawals are free) and their trading fees are less than .2%.   If you're trading 10k a week like you say, then you're saving $80/week on trading fees which should make up for the deposit fees if you structure it right 
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:30:25


Not online.  When I pay with bitpay or coinbase, all I have to do is click the link and confirm the payment details, I don't have to type in anything.  However when I pay with credit card, I have to insert the number, the security code, my name and my address, and often times the name of the bank that issued the card.  Bitcoin really is gaining in terms of convenience.  It's certainly not where it needs to be yet to go main steam, but it's getting tere.

Have you looked at Ethereum yet? I don't know why'd anyone would bother with this subreddit if the following wasn't self-evident to them:
cryptocurrency is the only financial medium in existence that allows one to freely and securely send any amount of value anywhere in the world instantly and at a truly fair cost without having to trust any other third-party.
I just don´t understand why anyone would bother with bitcoin if they can´t see the categorical importance of this technology.  It´s the internet of financial contracts
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:23:58


I don't understand why you think that..


Yea, but they give it to you in bitcoin.  It's not reasonable.  Especially when I asked that instead of a refund I just get store credit towards my next purchase.  They pretty much gave me the worst deal possible, as well as the most difficult for them.  It's like they went out of their way to make the entire deal as shitty as possible for me.

No, he lost them because he moved them from Coinbase, all 60 of them. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:26:50
You would have to mod your client with a script to do this automatically for you.  I wouldn't call it 'trust-less' since you'd have to trust whoever wrote the script as well as the person(s)  who control the scripted client.
There are also third party webclients that can do this for you, I believe coinsplit.io has already been mentioned, but then you have to trust that service.
What you could do is make an M of N wallet scripted to automatically split the funds for you after prompting each of you for your private key, but it'd probably be simpler to just create a regular M of N wallet and then when you are ready just split the funds manually.

Dude. Of course I contacted support.  They told me I'm shit out of luck unless I release all my details.
It happened randomly.  I've had this account since Coinbase first started.  I never connected a bank account, just used it as a really simply online wallet.  then yesterday I was trying to send some money and I get this error: More verification required to send funds. or something like that.  I contact support and ask WTF?  They're like "sorry for the inconvenience"  I told them I wanted to close the account.  They told me they will not release funds until I give up my privates.
Look through my comment history.  I have been promoting Coinbase forever.  I was a huge fan.  I still think they are good for somethings, but I feel completely violated right now.

It doesn't really do anything that you couldn't already do on any bitcoin exchange, in fact it does far less, as far as I can see.  It's basically Coinapult locks with a more competitive fee.

The fact that you are comparing an SEC regulated ETF to Magic the Gathering Online Exchange pretty much confirms it for me.
I've been working with bitcoin since 2011.  No, I'm probably not going to buy into this ETF because I'm confident enough in my security methods to fore go the management fee.  However that does not mean that I would EVER recommend to anyone, whether it be my friends and family or strangers on the internet that they choose personal storage vs a regulated ETF like this unless they were extremely knowledgeable IT professionals.  
Your security is certainly not "full-proof"  There will always be a villain out there more clever than you who could weasel out your private key wherever you have it hidden if they were determined enough.  And even if you're the most accomplished IT security expert in the world and have your key memorized, that won't stop a couple determined thugs from kidnapping you and peeling off your skin one little strip at a time until you eagerly offer them your private key.
Sure that's all still relatively true of keeping your funds in an ETF, but the fact of the matter is, while for people like you and me its perfectly fine to handle our own funds, for the vast majority of the people in the world something like this ETF is going to be a far far superior option.  If you can't see that you're a dimwit

Well, they could, just not without moving the market.  
I see what you're saying though, since price is directly tied to market-cap and volatility, it has an affect on its utility.  I'd argue that price is more a symptom of these aspects that affect bitcoin's utility rather than a contributing factor, although for most practical purposes that's a moot point

This sort of advice wouldn't have helped op. He was moving to cold storage. You have to use online wallets like Coinbase or other exchanges in order to initially purchase btc in the first place. So he would have been hacked no matter what method of cold storage he used. Obviously there are still many steps he could have taken to prevent the theft, but your advice is not one of them.
I'm not saying it's not good advice, but in case there is a noob reading who may be confused, this would not have made a difference in this particular instance

Don't spend your mined coins, just buy some with your fiat, or earn another way, and spend those coins and consider the 1% or whatever that you lose in the conversion as an investment in the bitcoin economy making your mined coins more valuable.

A large percentage of bitcoin volume is still speculators.  The price can't stay still for too much time before these guys get bored.  Since the price looked like it was starting to sink a bit after jumping to 650 everyone decided it was too high.  If you look at the charts, it's fairly likely that the price will drop to as low as 515 in the next month and a half or so, but it shouldn't drop any lower than that without some really bad news coming out for bitcoin.

from the FAQ:
How do cancellations and returns work?
You can cancel an order yourself before the order is processed (usually within the first hour of placing it) on the order detail page. If you need to cancel after that, please reply to your order confirmation email.
To make a return, please reply to your order confirmation email. Our return policy will match that of the vendor from which you purchased the item -- usually, returns received within 30 days after the purchase will be eligible for a full refund.

What about in the future when the rewards have halved and ASIC technology is no longer cost effective to keep advancing and you have these giant mining companies running on razor thin margins.  What if a couple of them get the idea secretly short the bitcoin market and then publicly attack the network..  They wouldn't even have to succeed.  The loss of faith just from the miners turning on us would collapse the price and earn them a fortune that far exceeds years of running on those paper-thin margins.

you'll get the hang of it. Back in 2011 when the price crashed from $32 in June to $2 November (and then stayed below $10 all through-out the next year) it seemed like there was nothing but bad news. Hacks, scams, bugs, bankruptcies, Wired released a feature piece called "The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin" It felt like the world had written us off.  
But whenever I'd feel lost I'd just look at the code: Anything wrong with it?  Nope, works fine.  Then I'd look at the world: Anything out there that allows me to instantly send any amount of value anywhere in the world at cost without having to trust any bank or government or other fallible institution?  Nope.  This is the future.
Back then I figured $100 was about 5 years in the future. $1000 was at least 10 years off. Tiger Direct accepting directly? Countries banning it? Re-writing tax laws? Investment firms brokering access to wallstreet? That was the stuff of sci-fi novels.
You spend a few years with bitcoin and your sense of limitation will be blown away and soon enough you'll come to enjoy these lulls and tell the newbies about how you used to have to copy and paste these long-ass public keys directly into the core desktop client after waiting near days to download the entire blockchain.

I haven't read through the discussions so you have that up on me but I can't shake the feeling that Mike wouldn't make proposals with the sole intention of compromising the security of Tor.  
I've heard of his stance on whitelisting coins and while I don't agree with it, I can understand the reasoning behind it (Think of how many bitcoin hackers would have been thwarted, how many people could get their stolen funds back).
I'm not trying to defend Mike's actions, I'd just like to hold this community to a higher standard of discussion.  Pointing fingers and screaming 'government shill' is akin to the anarchist version of "Think of the children".  If we're going to disagree, let's do it constructively.

what OP didn't illustrate, though he mentioned them, was the signatures.  The CSV will have a copy of the message for each of the above addresses signed by the private key of each address.  Thus the only way the auditor could read each message would be by using the specified bitcoin address to decrypt it.  These signatures can't possibly be forged anymore than one could forge a bitcoin transaction

Bitpay has also been in business a lot longer than Coinbase, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of their valuation came from actual bitcoins they accumulated early on that have since appreciated. 
They could also be over-valuated or valuated based on projections.
I would be really surprised though if Coinbase didn't receive the majority of their revenue from the 1% exchange rate from people buying and selling.  I just can't believe that's not their bread and butter.  The majority of people who purchase bitcoin in the states go through Coinbase.  Considering the size of the darkmarket now, that's a lot of people

These kind of reactions are overkill and detrimental to the community at large. This the internet.  Are people suddenly no longer supposed to be free to express opinions that differ from yours?  Mike's proposals may complicate the anonymity of the darkest corners of the darknet, but they also increase the usability for the vast majority of privacy seekers.  There's always been this tension between security and convenience and just because someone is on the other side of the argument doesn't mean we should write them off as some kind of liberty hater.

no, no no.  Please just stop talking.  Go read the white paper for bitcoin, then read the white paper for Ethereum.  They are two different protocols. They share some similar ideas, and bitcoin certainly inspired Ethereum, but it would be monumentally more difficult to incorporate turing-complete implementation of Ethereum than it would to alter the the number of bitcoins released in each block.  Fuck. I could go into the source code of my bitcoin client right now and change the number of bitcoins released each block.  Of course nobody is going to agree which such so that´s why we don´t worry about any such change occurring.  But such a change has nothing to do with the architecture of the protocol itself.

I'm sorry some of us had a little faith in the good will of a company with the reputation of coinbase.
MtGox was a completely different ball game.  Mark was obviously incompetent and corrupt for years before that scandal broke.  I took my money out of Gox the first time they fucked up like any sane person should have done.
This is the first I've heard of Coinbase pulling this kind of shit.  Did I know it was possible?  Yes.  Did I think it was likely? No.  I had been using them for over a year with no problems and having heard of no problems.  Why are you giving me shit for having expectations of a reputable company?

It was a huge thing back in 2012. MNW ended up getting banned from the forum because when Pirate ponzi scheme first started showing cracks, he said he would bet anyone who was in doubt that Pirate would come though, offering them a kind of hedge against the investment.  A bunch of people took him up on it and when the Pirate disapeared, MNW said he was just trolling everyone.  He ended up paying some of the bet, but he lost a lot of credibility

The problem that I'm worried about is what happens when the margins for these giant and largely centralized mining groups begins to thin.  With the increase in mining power going up fast and the rewards halving pretty consistently, this is bound to happen eventually.  What's to stop miner conglomerate A from colluding with mining conglomerate B to make a huge short on bitcoin and then threaten the community with a 51% attack and making a fortune when the price collapses.

They weren't shitposts.  They were the highest voted in the thread.  I was participating in the conversation between Ferroh and MNW, niether of which are trolls (well, maybe MNW, but Ferroh is a very respected member of the community).  This is what happened:
Matthew Neal Wright posted some advice on investing that made the front page. Some redditors started making comments about MNW's past misadventures vouching for the scammer Pirate and then reneging on a bet he made in favor of Pirate MNW began defending himself in his usual style. The mods then came in and deleted the entire conversation claiming that MNW's past investment experience had no relevance to his present advice.

That's not really accurate.  If the hackers had hacked the entire data-base of any bank, they would have the same kind of vulnerable information that the Gox hackers have now, including social security numbers, wealth figures, related accounts the like.

No, they used the term "inherent" which is incorrect because that would have to mean that volatility is built into the bitcoin design or that it must always be volatile.

I'm more concerned about this idea:
every 4 years the reward for miners halves. yet the investment into mining is still increasing.  There's eventually going to be a couple big mining conglomerates who have a ton invested into bitcoin mining and are faced with imminent profit losses as their rewards are halved.  If they decide to say 'fuck it' and go out of business, all of a sudden it will take weeks for a confirmation to be confirmed.  But more likely these oligarchs who together have all this power over bitcoin will collude to pull one big scam and get out with as much money as they can.  Either way, its just not sustainable.
(That's not to say it can't and won't be fixed.  I'm just saying the current model is deficient.)

We do not live in a civilized society.  A society that locks non-violent drug users in cages, tortures our captives and murders people without trial from drones is anything but civilized.  If we lived in a truly civilized society then SR would never have needed to exist in the first place.  SR was the first step towards becoming a truly civilized society.

You really think these ETF guys will be able to issue bitcoins they don't actually have though? I always figured those gold certificates were backed up by real gold in a vault somewhere and that there was some kind of accountability in place for it

No, this is the exact opposite of NEOBEE.  NEOBEE was for Euro users who wanted to get into bitcoin, this is for bitcoin users who want to get into gold and fiat.  it's far far less risky and requires far far less banking cooperation. 
Also this is run and backed by Voorhees, who's already made his fortune and who benefits more from the value that this service lends to the bitcoin community rather than the revenue from the service itself.

There is such a thing as trusting a company to act in good faith.  Coinbase has violated my good faith with these recent actions.  I am warning the community of this breach of faith so others like myself who did trust Coinbase will be more wary.

Yea that's tough, I'm sorry for getting on your case about it.  Backing up your wallet is as easy as putting it in a small trucrypt file and emailing it to yourself.  As long as you use strong encryption with a good password that you know you'll never lose, it's safer than fort knox.

@_date: 2014-04-20 22:14:20
Personally I'd be far more willing to let the whole incident slide if you weren't such an arrogant prick about the whole thing.  You don't seem capable of simply admitting you seriously fucked up, made a morally abject decision and genuinely hurt many people who had entrusted you with their faith. 
 Instead you call it a prank, deride your victims as likely scammers themselves with no intention of paying it back, and justify everything with the little penance you did obligingly did pay.  
I'm not necessarily saying that your wrong in anything you've said, just that you stink.
It reminds me of Scott Adams when he created that pseudonym to prop himself in online discussion boards and then behaved like pompous cunt when he was found out.

This is a sore point for a lot of bitcoiners. Personally I think mining is the single weakest aspect of the bitcoin protocol. There are other protocols like ripple that have developed a consensus authenticated transaction system and I'm hoping there will eventually be a bitcoin fork that switches to a similar model

@_date: 2014-04-06 19:41:24
The company that lunched the first Ripple implementation simply aren't recognizing any other validators except their own at this time, probably to reduce risks and avoid complications while the code is still in Beta, but anyone can take the open-source code and launch their own implementation that is completely decentralized whenever they like.
I still don't understand why is so hostile towards Ripple.  I think as concept its more robust than bitcoin and honestly I think cutting out mining is going to be an important step in bitcoin's evolution eventually.

true, but there are some genuinely new ideas and improvements being made that I don´t think Bitcoin will quite be able to replicate fast enough to compete, like Ripple or Ethereum.  At first I believe these new protocols will be complimentary to bitcoin, but eventually, if Bitcoin can´t keep up, they will start over shadowing it.

@_date: 2014-08-22 19:57:52
I agree, and I'm all for decentralization and individuals having the power to take control of their own money.  But I also believe that services like coinbase have a valid role to play too, especially for casual users.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:17:10
Yea, its a good time. Price might dip a little below 300, but considering there really isn't available roof on how high it could eventually go, waiting for another price drop at this point is like risking a 7 course meal just so you can lick a few crumbs off the floor

@_date: 2014-08-21 21:23:10
There has never been a single legit VC - backed bitcoin company that lost anyone's money. I trust coinbase to keep my coins safe more than myself because I am more vulnerable to hackers than they are even if I spend months educating myself on computer security. They are also a hell of a lot more convenient

Please think about what you are saying, Coinbase isn't even an exchange, they are a broker.  I can instantly trade as much money as I please on a real exchange like bitfinex, and I can deposit or withdraw fiat or bitcoin.

Bitcoinica was the first exchange to offer margin trading, it was started by some 17 kid in China named Zao Toung who sold it just before it was hacked and people are still trying to get their money out the litigation process.
BS&amp;T was pirateat40's ponzi scheme
BIPS is just a payment processor that competes with Bitpay.  I don't recall there being a scandal.  (Edit: BIPS was also hacked November 2013 losing 1300 customer bitcoins)

They only care about the network as long as they are making a profit.  When the profit margins thin, there will be more incentive to manipulate the network if they can figure out a way to profit from said manipulation (i.e.  They put short bitcoin on margin and then go rogue and when the price crashes, they make a fortune)

@_date: 2014-04-15 08:28:50
I like Ripple, I don't understand why it gets so much flak on this subreddit.  People whine about it being premined and centralized, but that's because they don't have the wits to separate the protocol from the company.
I really like that they did away with mining, which I think is the least sustainable aspect of Bitcoin, as well as its weakest point of failure.
Bitcoin is open source and I don't think there is a crypto-currency in existence that can really hurt it. If anything truly groundbreaking comes out, we can always fork the bitcoin code and implement it.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:55:10
ok, I thought all decentralized systems used some form of consensus.  Can you clarify the differences?  I'm looking for a lesson
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:04:37
Exactly.  but it is very close to 1000kb.  A decent percentage of the world's population using bitcoin is not going to make smaller blocks
@_date: 2014-08-22 20:05:14
That's a great idea, but its not exactly simple and certainly not idiot proof.  If I were a new user, that would take a couple days of googling and testing and even then I'd have this uneasiness about fucking something up, losing a key, having a hacker put a key logger on my computer, whatever.
I trust coinbase as much as I'd trust any bank.  it's great for casual users.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:17:59
I feel like Ripple is going to want to sue the shit out of Stellar.  How does Mcaleb think he can get away with this?
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:16:26
Technically, it´s not actually that difficult.  
All these other competitors to bitcoin have to be open source.  So if one of them comes up with a truly brilliant idea, it would be fairly easy for devs to implement the protocol change (read: copy-past) in a way that maintained continuity with bitcoin´s old chain (i.e. we all still have the % of coin in the updated (likely forked) protocol that we had before.
The real difficulty is the politics of getting everyone to agree on a particular change.  What will likely happen is that bitcoin will fork several times (much like different linux distributions) until one is taken on by a serious market mover (like google did with android, which is linux)

This is exactly the sort of services that bitcoin needs to see coming out.
However, It seems as though they've left out the key component of the multi-sig process..  The Arbitrator.  Who makes the judgement call in the case of a dispute and how do they get paid?  I don't see that covered anywhere in the explanation.
I like that some is actually taking on this challenge though 
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:19:11
Ethereum and Ripple both allow a much more flexible protocol that allows people to issue their own currencies or financial contracts etc..

It's a scam or something shady.  There's no such thing as buy bitcoin in bulk.  Stay away.
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:58:22
Bleh.  The comments here are depressing.  Nobody seems to be able to admit that the mining aspect of bitcoin really is unsustainable as is.  I think it can be fixed eventually with a hardfork, but its much like the size limit of the blocks or the fix that we'll need to be able to really incorporate sidechains.  It's an issue that will need to be solved eventually.
I'm not saying bitcoin really is doomed, but lets try and give some credit where credit is due.  Mining in its current form is unsustainable.

Which part of the statement is hyperbolic exactly? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:06:23
You seem to be implying that just because centralized financial institutions capitalize on the benefits of bitcoin, decentralized alternatives can no longer exist.
Stripe isn't trying to become the end all be all of bitcoin.  They are trying to become the first major financial processor from the established system to take advantage of some of the benefits bitcoin holds. 
They are still going to be discriminatory, exclusive, and highly regulated (at least initially).  And liberally minded innovators like you and me are still going to neglected and we're going to avoid their service and utilize more intelligent options.  
The important difference is that in the future Stripe lays out in this blog, Bitcoin will not be some cumbersome, fringe novelty.  It will be the equivalent of cold hard cash today.  "Sorry, we don't take ~~cards~~ ~~checks~~ Paypal, only ~~cash~~ bitcoin"  Sure it's a bit more inconvenient.  But going to your bank or atm and taking out cash is a hell of a lot easier than verifying a coinbase account and waiting for ACH transfers to come through.  It's a win win for everyone in the bitcoin world
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:00:10
no, never.  the insecure nature of credit cards has conditioned me to do any and all shopping from the safety of my own personal machines.  I see your point though.  However I still don't think I'd ever feel comfortable doing financial transactions on a machine I couldn't trust

I really wouldn't expect any immediate boost for a relatively unheard of clothing store.  A lot of merchants are jumping on the bitcoin band-wagon hoping to share some of its spotlight, but when it comes down to it, a business is going to thrive on its own merits and bitcoin integration should be the same.  If you don't think bitcoin is a superior payment system, or you don't have customers specifically requesting it, don't bother.
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:04:30

It is easy to fix problems just like that, like you said, the issues weren't critical. You can look at the fixes yourself and easily see that they are definitely improvements (more iterations added in most cases).  I'd much prefer to use a program that was being maintained as new hacking methods are discovered constantly.

@_date: 2014-04-15 06:49:32
Zinc claims to pass on all the same benefits except for certain manufacturer warranties that specify buying through an approved re-seller.
Anyway it's still way more convenient. If I want to buy something via gyft, I have to find it on amazon go through the checkout process and figure out exactly how much it costs go to gyft and purchase the necessary credit, apply the code, and then go through the checkout process again.  And that's relatively painless compared to buy through a different store where I don't get to pick the amount but instead have to buy $50 exactly or $100 exactly.
This plug in not only makes that process unnecessary, but it helps you find the best possible deal from the get go, saving you time and money.

That's the stupidest reasoning I've ever heard. People who have lots of bitcoin want everybody to get as much bitcoin as possible because it makes thier bitcoin worth more.  The people who want smaller blocks are generally mining interests who want to see more fee revenue

Let's drop the kiddie porn thing. That was an irrelevant and unproductive place to take this discussion.
By your own admission the financial sector is opaque and difficult to understand. "That's the way the game is played" doesn't mean it's not corrupt. If you look at all the evidence put together, this is very obviously a case of corruption. This is the second revision of the license and probably what the final product will look like. There's no reason objections that weren't heeded the first time around will suddenly carry weight. Lawsky is a finacial lawyer and has zero expertise in the technology world  other than the meetings he's had while putting together this license. That means his consulting will likely focus helping businesses obtain said licence. How do you get license? It's opaque, but basically you need the regulators permission. Lawsky knows every single person that stamps these permissions. He knows the secret handshake. And now he's started a business selling this secret handshake. 
I'm having a hard time digesting the idea that anyone could be as naive as you seem to want to be, but I'll tell you what. Let's table this discussion until the final bit license is released. If the positive changes that you've linked actually take place then i will eat my words and concede the argument and edit all my posts to that effect. I have been wrong before, and I wouldn't mind being wrong in this case. I just can't fathom reality being anything other than it appears right now

Sure that's the case for right now, but in the future, after most of the smaller ventures have given up and some of the bigger ones have bought each other out/merged operations to stay competitive we'll be looking as a different landscape.  The miners will only be able to sell their miners at a little below the electricity efficiency rate and will still have some r&amp;d costs from developing the latest asic.  They have to decide if they're better off selling the equipment or taking advantage of their power over bitcoin.  Even if they do decide to take the moral route, they buyers of the old equipment are going to be faced with the same conundrum.  If you're faced with making razor thin margins or exerting control of/manipulating a multi-billion dollar asset class.  There are many people who'd choose to do the latter.

Yes, basically the price will continue to downtrend until either the price reflects actual adoption, which would be less than $100, or until some other big fish jump on the bandwagon, and there probably wont be any more big fish for a few months at least, by which time a better bitcoin will become popular and most of us will move over

Well I asked that they not give any bitcoin back and just give me store credit first, but they said it was impossible so I figure that meant that they had never cashed out the bitcoin in the first place.  It's like they went out of their way to give me the least value possible
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:55:27
p2pool is still a pool, its just a decentralized one without a central authority. As far as I'm aware, when you use p2pool you are still opting against mining in the client with the full node so as far as full node hosting goes, there isn't a difference between p2pool and other pools.
Anyway, I think you're mistaken to believe that miners are the main source of full nodes. Most full nodes are hosted by users who are committed to bitcoin.  I agree that there should be better ways to incentavize running a full node.  I admit that larger blocks will disincentivize full nodes.  I don't see how mining centralization is going to be a consequence of larger blocks

All the good day-traders I know never use the news as indicators.  They just look at those charts and wait for their specific patterns to show up.

Nasdaq is NOT using bitcoin.  They are using a distributed ledger system.  And you don't need to use the "currency" as a currency.  In Ripple or Ethereum for example the "currency" just functions as an anti-spam mechanism whereas the units of value are issued and used on top of the protocol

The company that lunched the first Ripple implementation simply aren't recognizing any other validators except their own at this time, probably to reduce risks and avoid complications while the code is still in Beta, but anyone can take the open-source code and launch their own implementation that is completely decentralized whenever they like.

nobody is making money off this and its benefiting the community at large.  The truecrypt team should have opensourced the code before they abandoned the project.

Well I disagree.  I think 1mb was always too small to scale, especially if you want to build lots of cool side-chain projects ontop of the protocol and I thinks its too early to begin experimenting with the fee market.  But that's kinda the crux of the issue I guess
Maybe I'm not fully informed on the issue, but I don't quite understand your last point about trusting miners with too much hashrate.  What does that have to do with anything?  The miners just validate the blocks, its the nodes that have to figure out how to store the added bulk
@_date: 2015-05-26 02:10:42
Since you're a lazy ass i went and did the research and came up with this:  
Bigger blocks make it harder and more expensive to run full nodes with crappy old machines/tor
20mb isn't going to be enough eventually either, we're just kicking the can down the road.
There might be a better solution we just haven't figured out yet
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to make users pay a fee to have their transactions included in the blocks. That was kinda how the system was designed
Basically they just want to wait for a more elegant decision
How did I do?

I don't understand why you guys don't partner with a better bitcoin processor to give you better exchange rates.  You guys are charging something like 2.5% under spot to sell bitcoin when the steepest rates at coinbase or bitpay are only 1%
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:59:26
That's true, although it shouldn't be too different from using coinbase, and maybe even easier since coinbase doesn't let you keep USD in their account so you have to wait a few days for each and every transaction to clear. 
Do you trade both ways or mostly just sell bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:26:25
What do you want me to do? Use program that the developers themselves have said is not secure? I donated more than enough money when they were active. Give up on your project and leave people insecure? Fuck you too then. Just because you wrote the code doesn't mean you don't have a responsibly to the people who have trusted it with their sensitive information. As far as I'm concerned, truecrypt forefiet thier rights to the code when they abandoned the project. You can't take your ball and go home when it comes to security software

You're talking about mining pools I assume.  Adjusting the block size isn't going to have any bearing whatever on whether or not a miner is going to opt to use a pool.  Anyone who doesn't have a million dollar setup is going to join a pool for the simple reason that otherwise you will be waiting years before you actually find a block.
Miners are not generally the ones who run full nodes anyway

The point is that the development of veracrypt is opensource.   They have developers who are performing edits which are completely transparent and everyone can see happen live.

Nobody has a problem with this.


Like what exactly?  I can't think of any reason crypt needs to be treated differently and neither does the department of justice.  Lawsky is very alone on this opinion except in the case of the ill-informed and the special interest powers that stand to be disrupted.  The only reason I can think of for creating this licence is that he will personally profit by it.  If you have a (-relevant-) example I'm all ears. 


Which is exactly why its unethical to do so, to prevent the incentive to make dealing with the NYDFS onerous for others to deal with and secure his monopoly in the field.  The reason he's likely chosen crypto-currencies to focus on is that none of his predecessor's secret handshakes will work thanks to the new cryptocurrency handshake he's invented and called "Bitlicense" There's half a billion dollars in venture capitol just waiting to skimmed by this clever little lawyer leech. 


Why are you in this sub if you don't believe in the power of this technology to curb the scope and impact of systemic corruption?


That's what I thought
 &gt;Does it impair new companies to a great degree or not in actual practice? 
 So far there is only one company operating legally in NY.  Vs thousands New Mexico.  Not Coinbase has gotten approval. So that one has already been answered.

@_date: 2015-05-21 14:39:54
wtf? Are you high? Porn is not at all analogous.  Kiddie porn is a criminal activity that involves preying upon and exploiting children.  Also, porn makers are not required to submit their films for approval.  They just release their shit because they understand what the rules are and if someone thinks its wrong they have to prove it before it gets banned.
Bitlicense works completely opposite.  Everything is banned until you obtain explicit permission.  If you want to start a service or even alter an existing service, you are require to apply for a permission before you are allowed to even get started.  It is completely up to the discretion of the state to issue licences.  You honestly don't see power imbalance this gives to the license issuers?
As I said, the only context in which a permit system makes sense is when managing physical space, of which there is a limited amount.  
Rules are one thing.  If you want to say that a business has to be reasonably confident about the identity of their customers, fine. Whatever.  Then you bust companies that don't follow the rules.  Creating a permit system for a digital space is creating an artificial scarcity that benefits nobody except the artificial gatekeepers.

Yes it does because p2pool is the only way a miner can have a chance of getting a reward without using a centralized mining pool

I'm going to need you to go ahead and explain this because I really don't see how that's true and it kinda sounds like you don't either.

that's exactly why Gavin proposed the larger blocksize.  More transactions/block means faster transaction times and fewer dropped transactions.  The size of the block isn't really an issue for miners, if it was they would simply not include all the spam transactions or transactions that don't pay a fee.
I mean I guess I can see how incentivizing higher fees would make mining more profitable and make it more competitive, but I don't think that's really going to come into play until the next halving

I didn't understand anything in this comment. Do you know what a URI is? 
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:07:09
Who is actually using bitcoin and denying it?  I have not heard of one person or company doing this.  People who claim to be using "bitcoin technology" are usually using a proof-of-share distributed ledger system because it removes mining from the equation.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:56:59
Where is this?  What happened?
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:06:16
That's exactly what is being debated.  People who don't want to increase the block size are saying that there's really no rush.  I disagree, as does Gavin.  But I think they are right when they say that the consequences aren't quite as bad as what a lot of people are screaming about
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:39:25
He included a clause that requires any business offering or altering a crypto currency service to get explicit permission from the state. Now he plans to profit by "consulting" businesses looking for permission. It's poster board corruption

The second audit has been finished. Also veracrypt is open source 
@_date: 2015-05-21 11:48:51
Requiring permission to act instead of merely outlining the rules by which action must take place is unnecessary in a digital space and serves only to create an atmosphere where regulators become market makers who's service is sold to the highest bidder. The only reason I can think of where a permit system makes sense is where public space needs to be managed  (i.e. parades, public booths, etc). In the digital world where space is not an issue, artificially limiting access is merely a way to line the pockets of the artificial gatekeepers
@_date: 2015-05-18 23:31:31
Isn't that what the developers do?  Who is supposed to conduct these reviews?  Why didn't anyone care about reviewing truecrypt, which wasn't even opensource, until last year?

I never thought Theymos actively promoted it.  I was just summerizing what MNW was claiming when his posts got deleted.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:15:35
So then what does that have to do with the block size?
@_date: 2015-05-27 02:51:53
How do you reduce variance without forfeiting block generation? 
Ok, so let me get this straight. btcguild as a server that distributes hashes to all the connected miners, when a miner finds a block there is some mechanism that prevents the miner from taking it directly to the rest of the network and claiming the reward all to himself.  Instead, btcguild broadcasts the block to the network and splits the reward among all the miners according to how many hashes they tried and contributed.
So how does it work in P2pool?  There as to be some mechanism for splitting the reward and for preventing the individual miners from the reward.  It seems like you could very easily run your miners on P2pool without running a full node, just like centralized pool miners do.
What does running a node have to do with anything?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:59:42
How much money are you talking about?  Coinbase and circle are perfectly fine for anything under 10,000. If you want to do more than that, I'd  recommend bitfinex.
There are a lot of good cold storage guides out there. I think the faq here in r/bitcoin has one. But what I would do is wipe any old computer, install the client, (no need to worry about downloading the entire chain you just need to generate a wallet) and then backup your keys (encrypted of course) on a few flash drives. Copy your public keys somewhere you can access them for sending coins. 
Getting hacked really is a rare occurance for most individuals with some basic awareness of computer security. You're far more likely to lose your keys or forget your password. That's why I generally advise newbies to use a service like circle or coinbase with two factor authentication unless they are talking about their life savings.
 If you do decide to go ice-cold nest egg, definitely practice your procedure with a small amount (taking it in and out of cold storage) before messing around with real money.  
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:13:15

That's what I thought.  He definitely did his research, and I think he has a pretty decent argument
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:53:13
That doesn't really add up since the reward is being split between half as many miners so even if it takes twice as long they are earning twice the share that they would normally

It's really not as big a deal as you seem to be making it. Just buy a couple and keep them on circle or coinbase. Both are just as secure, probably more-so, than payal or online banking. If you want to put aside a nest-egg then install a wallet on a clean, offline computer and keep a couple backups on some securely stored flash disks and treat them like little blocks of gold.

You can spend it just fine from Coinbase. If op had done this he might have lost the cost of an online purchase instead of his entire savings. 
People will call you an idiot if your bitcoin aren't locked away on three separate flash drives, and yes cold storage is certainly the safest, but you still have to know what you're doing. There's a reason security it firms exist 
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:43:31
No, bitcoin is exponentially more useful than gold. In fact, cryptocurrency is the only financial medium in existence that allows one to freely and securely send any amount of value anywhere in the world instantly and at a truly fair cost without having to trust any other third-party. That's it. Nothing else. Not the anonymity, which honestly is about as difficult to ensure as it is create a fake identity. And not the 21 million market cap, which is really just an arbitrary and undeveloped adoption scheme that will be subtly undermined by the increasing number of alt-coins sprouting up.

I don't think you understand the future situation.  In the future, there will be no 'individuals' joining pools.  They will all be forced to close because they can't compete with giant warehouses running super efficient ASICS on from specialized power sources and cooling systems.  We will be dependent one 5 or 6 giant entities. If a couple of these entities decide (in secret, of course) to simultaneously short the market and then publicly attach the bitcoin system, faith will drop instantly, as will the price, and the conspiring entities will make a fucking fortune.
There is literally nothing we as a community could do to stop them unless we figure out how to fix the system before this happens.

It bothers me that people like you keep saying this because its not true.  You can very easily implement a blockchain ledger without using bitcoin.  Tons of alt-coins do it all the time.

Bitcoin is in the middle of a controversial hardfork. The vast majority of the community is in favor of the fork, (called BitcoinXT).  But there are a few individuals with a lot of power in the community, including the mods here, who oppose the fork. 
The mods have been deleting all references to XT and the community is starting to throw an insurrection.  Its a pretty exciting time for us

@_date: 2015-08-16 02:03:23
I think the pitchfork mobs are the result of the censorship, not so much the cause.  I respect your position, but I'm confident that XT will emerge eh the long chain and I can't wait to see issue get archived
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:48:48
That's bullshit. And the majority of the community agrees.  The fact that the mods have to use their powers to censor all disagreement  just illustrates how much bullshit that is. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:48:00
Basically, it doesn't bring the 8mb block size increase into effect until Jan 2016, and then it only does so if 75% of the miners have voted to use it.  This is to remove the risk of switching to the wrong fork.
You you really cant lose by switching to XT.  If it doesn't achieve majority, no harm done.  you simply keep using sub 1mb blocks.  But if it does achieve majority, well you've obviously made the right choice.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:15:47
Sure, and 95% are inactive

That's awesome, and I have tons respect for all the devs and all the work that they are doing and have done.  but this blocksize issue has been on the table for a really long time and the community wants to make a decision.  If it comes down to XT which has a solution, and core which doesn't seem willing to come up with one, how are we supposed choose?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:49:20
Well whatever you want to call deleting the highest voted discussion thread in your sub because you don't like what the majority are saying.  Blatantly corrupt at least

This is fucking classic.  Thank you for the find
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:37:01
The 8mb blocks don't go into effect until 2016. Every rational person agrees that the bock size needs to go up "eventually". Nobody has put forth a solution to better than XT. Projections show that 1mb blocks will adversely stunt bitcoin before 2017.
If you don't like XT, write your own fork

What incentive does a miner have to lie?  Creating uncertainty in the system would hurt bitcoin and thier profit base
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:46:15
So they actually left instructions for all mods to not do any moderating at all?
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:38:21
This is my understanding of the situation too.  I would welcome an opposing viewpoint though
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:22:00
We sure as hell didn't censor any information about the hardforks back then
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:17:34
okay, you can wallow in your circular arguments if you want, I'm going to go take part in the innovation of XT
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:01:44
What was the topic of the other case of censorship? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:44:34
Those are really easy fixes
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:45:53
Lightning can function just as well on XT.
And no we don't have time. Every minute we put off the scalability problem is a minute we can't continue innovating on a different, more pertinent issue
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:39:14
That's fine, I'm all for core releasing their own implementation.  Personally I hope XT inspires them to break this stupid gridlock and finally make a decision.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:24:31
Not on the XT side

I just don't see it. What is there to be confused about?   Miners willing shooting themselves in the foot? Not a scenario that's worth giving weight when the consequences are being left behind on an old chain while ask the evidence suggests the community has moved on

@_date: 2015-08-15 22:35:59
It makes it the next natural progression in case of gridlock. It's happening because it needs to. It's happening because a lot of people want it, so yes. It's right

Personally I don't think bitcoin.com should make its money promoting wallets, but I'm not condemning anyone over it

heh, fair enough
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:02:10


Those people should also switch to BitcoinXT.  The fact of the matter is, the core developers will absolutely not let XT become the dominant chain. As soon as they see XT gaining tranction they will implement their own block-size increase to keep people from switching.  
This whole this is just a brilliant way to break the gridlock among the core developers
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:42:00
No, but history does
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:02:33
Are you fucking kidding me?  Everybody agrees the block size must increase eventually.  XT is the ONLY solution that has been coded up and offered.  
It's not a fucking attack, its just common sense progress.
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:12:02
Never mind, I see it now.  Thanks
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:04:22
I meant like a summary of the actual proposal.. Like how much increase how fast etc..
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:45:56
It will be implemented as soon as the stuborn few people people who don't switch to XT realize they are doomed if they don't
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:07:40
Maybe if the mods stopped deleting the original discussion threads we wouldn't have to keep reposting back-ups
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:06:07

funny how the facts fly in your face and yet you forsake them anyway.  
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:02:05
This is a perfect response and voices everything I feel as an XT proponent. I don't think its perfect and I'm not a huge hearn fan, but I'm ready for progress to be in the realm of scalability hopefully this will kickstart that progress
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:47:16
You are seriously arguing that we should censor this sub for our own good?  Like Big brother?  You want to Big Brother bitcoin?  
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:09:49
... Name one core developer or expert who believes the blocksize should never be raised.
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:55:38
If that's happening, then its happening on both sides of the argument.  You cannot tell me that OG bitcoin fans are somehow more pious than the XT crowd.  Look at all the comments, the majority is clear as fucking day.  its not a fucking brigade, its an uprising. Fuck off censorship czars
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:41:09
They just can't reach a consensus and a few are accused of purposely dragging their feet in order to profit from smaller blocks.  I'm not sure about the ulterior motives, but I haven't heard anyone argue that small blocks are the most desirable ultimate solution.  
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:47:06
Mods labeled BitcoinXT an alt-coin and began censoring accordingly.  The community is not having it
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:41:31
Holy Shit.  The mods have really gone off the deep end.   We are in the middle of a full on insurrection 
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:31:28
The fork brings the debate to an actual vote, so people can still talk about it if they want, but progress is being made in the meantime
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:18:50
No, he was and has always been reluctant to take a leadership role.  However, this gridlock is insane and XT is the only solution anyone is willing to get behind. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:01:04
What incentive do miners have to lie?
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:20:16


Just the fact that you admit this means that XT is nothing like any other alt-coin.  If litecoin became more successful than bitcoin all of a sudden, would this thread change focus?  No.  Because Litecoin is not fucking bitcoin.  XT is bitcoin.  It has a very real chance of taking over the network.  We as a community need to have this issue in the open.  You are being a disgrace by trying to brush it under the rug.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:31:35
I honestly don't see larger blocks significantly reducing full nodes, by the time the blocks fill, we'll have the hardware to handle it
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:50:04
Good point.  Also, If everybody in the world except you stops using bitcoin for some reason, your coins will lose thier value 
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:54:49
version 0.2.10
The only point that is relevant is that XT is the only solution present.  The time has come and gone for just waiting around.  Anything we implement now is going to take months and months to test and make sure its ready for primetime.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:00:03
That week never happen. If a &gt;1mb enters the chain, that means old core has functionally ceased to exist.  If bitcoin ever decides it was better with smaller blocks, a soft limit can easily be implemented
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:30:25


Its not a fucking Alt. There is a very real difference between an alt and a fork.  Forks still run on the same network. Alts do not. There are maybe 15 people in this entire sub calling it an alt instead of the fork that it is. Just because half those people are mods does not make it true.
In the future, if we have other bitcoin forks, they should also no be censored.  We the community should be free to vote upon the forks that we feel are pertinent.  if you have thousands of forks, just leave it to us and stop trying to dictate the political narrative of this community
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:56:56
Yes, is just a Thermos minion.
is also an anti-XT nut job who believes it is the mods duty inflict their personal views on the community via censorship

really? But Bashco is moderating the v/bitcoin thread :(
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:22:35
First, I just want to apologize. I thought you were thick when i started this argument. Now I just disagree with you strongly.
The old code may exist, but nobody is going to be using it if the majority of minors are on XT. It will become an incompatible old version. 
If sone crazy situation ever comes up that pitts miners against the rest of the user base then we'll just implement another solution, but there will never be a case where we have to switch back to OG bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:50:28
That is kind of sketchy.  You know what I think should happen?  The rest the core developers should get off their asses and put together a block-size increase that they can agree on so we dont have to make this kind of vote.
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:38:10
its really just a ruse by Hearn to force the hand of the other core developers.  Once XT starts to gain steam they'll have to increase the blocksize to prevent losing complete control of the project
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:53:54
And all you small blockers are being led by small minded censor kings
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:10:52
I'm not paranoid if that's what you mean. Any problems that arise in XT are fixable ones
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:34:25
That won't happen. XT requires 75% of the vote before going into effect. The only people who will experience trouble are those who don't upgrade
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:06:22


You mean Gavin? The guy Satoshi personally left in charge and has devoted himself to the impartial development of bitcoin ever since?
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:20:14
I'm in that number
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:19:16
the 75% number comes from miners, not nodes
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:36:17
Yea I used to be their biggest fan on this sub.  But they have shitty practices and they don't even accept bitcoin for their ads.  They are a leech on the community
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:34:27
Then fucking step back and let them deal with the fallout.  Stop sticking up for those corrupt assholes like you're some kind of impartial mediator.  It's not your responsibility to try and placate the community.  If you want to extend the olive branch, line up on the right side.  There is absolutely nothing "understandable" about the decision to censor XT.  Its  purely political move that is out-right disgusting.  It cannot be justified and you are looking the fool for even trying
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:03:06
That's what I suspected.  Its mostly shit posts, all the good ones are still censored. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 15:19:44
I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. A disclaimer is a statement that denies responsibility. The word doesn't make any sense in this context.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:03:00
people donated a decent chunk of change to darkwallet, its pretty lame for the developers to take the money and run
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:43:06
I heard p2pool is going with XT
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:42:14
If the blocksize was never raised, eventually fees you sky rocket and bitcoin would fail.  Would you prefer a loss of 200 million or 6 billion?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:53:19
There is a very real sense in which they do. Do you consider slavery wrong? Guess who won the civil war?
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:05:41
I'm skeptical. Sounds a lot like shooting yourself in the foot. Especially if the uncertainty brings a price hit
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:15:45
same task, different stakes
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:58:05
Well I've been in this community for several years.  I have the utmost respect for all the developers, but Gavin has been proven himself an adept and non partisan lead. I have no qualms siding with him in political matters regarding bitcoin.  The bock size debate has been a serious issue for years and XT is the only solution that really exists right now.  If other solutions are presented then we can talk
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:54:11
Is not hype, is how the software works. The dictators with tantrums are the ones who refuse to offer any concrete solutions to real problems
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:52:14
Do you have any idea how crazy you sound?  the only reason to withhold information is if you're scared of truth
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:54:57
75% of all miners. If you upgrade to XT you already vote for larger blocks
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:03:12
What are you taking about? How does a miner vote except with hashing power? 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:39:49
No, people give bitcoin value. Coinbase and Bitpay represent millions of people. Anyway, if you're fine being such a small continent then good on you i guess. I don't understand the principles you're standing up for, but I have no problem with you standing for them
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:27:20
Its not blockstream.  Thermos has been a long corrupt member of this community with waay too much control of discussion. is just his little minion.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:59:23
why would XT nodes relay double spends?
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:14:03
That's fine, be concerned. Then come up with a better solution. 
I disagree that bigger blocks will lead to centralization and I'm tired of a debate where one side does nothing but shoot down solutions.  
If an XT contender enters the frey then maybe I will switch sides. Till then progress must be made 
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:49:09
How the hell are you not grasping the concept of a 75% mining threshold before the XT kicks in? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:15:02
Because we have enough trolls to deal with
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:05:48
You couldn't mine bitcoin with 25% of Bitcoin hash rate.  Blocks would take hours to confirm. The chain would be completely abandoned within days
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:08:28
This is my theory too
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:16:54
Are you kidding me? That's how you want to argue?  You are a fucking moron who obviously knows nothing about the issue. Hard rules have been changed several times in the bitcoin client, so your argument is invalid, the original bitcoin chain died years ago.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:40:56
You mean the block reward? 
The problem is, if nobody is using OG, then 25 OG won't be worth anything
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:32:02
The most profitable option is the one that is being used and has value.
Who is in support of XT?
 Coinbase
Several exchanges and clients and many others I cant remember.  Just coinbase really would be enough though. 
Who can you tell me is so opposed to XT that they would risk losing all thier business putting up a fight?  
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:48:46
Why would anyone have a problem with this? Where is the downside? 
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:02:16
Wow.  And yet the top post is still censored?

It's easy to claim vote manipulation when the majority disagrees with you
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:45:15
The only way a &gt;1mb block gets accepted in XT is if it already has 75% of the hashing power. At which point XT  is bitcoin and "bitcoin core" is now an incompatible old version

Significant difference there
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:57:03
I hear a lot of clamoring for decentralization.  I am completely unconvinced that that block size increases will adversely affect decentralization
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:57:39
It's not a concern. Smaller blocks = centralization as fees rise and people depend on centralized LN hubs
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:45:06
They have said so, we've said fuck off.  They seem to be saying 'whatever' for now:
We'll see what happens in the morning
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:30:23
Yea, I'm in favor of increasing the blocksize limit, but I really dont get all the Blocksteam hate. These guys are adding a ton of value to bitcoin.  The projects they are working on are basically the infrastructure for future crypto
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:18:45
That percentage is up to 4 already today.  Better watch out, XT is coming

Their withdrawal fees for people outside the Eurozone are kinda steep. $15 minimum + .09%.  That's a lot more than the $.25 or free ACH that I get from most US-based exchanges.

Perhaps they should post their solutions as BIPS instead of whining about how they need more time to come up with something

@_date: 2012-06-01 02:57:25
You wouldn't be able to do it all at once, and you'd definitely be moving the market, which means you might initially lose some of the value of your savings as speculators try and cash in on the movement.
If you did it gradually though, or used bitcoin in tandem with another physical currency, there's a lot of potential in the idea, and it'd definitely be easier to implement than trying to start a currency from scratch. 
@_date: 2012-03-26 19:26:00

Hey I am a huge fan of your site and how you guys do business.  I was just curious what it would take for you guys to incorporate Bitcoin as a payment system.  The system has come a long way since the days of its recent notoriety and with competitive payment gateway services like Bitpay and Paysius making bitcoin acceptance seamless and much cheaper than VISA Master Card and the like I just thought I throw it out there as a suggestion.  Not to mention the 100,000 + bitcoin user techsavey community that are eager to patronize bitcoin friendly businesses.
Just a friendly and hopeful heads up :)

Its not a no brainer because as soon (if) as these hit the market, the difficulty level will skyrocket and there's only a few months left before the mining reward halves to only 25btc/block.  It might still be worth it, but I wouldn't call it a no brainer.

It's just the start. Think about what this paves the way for:
 Imagine building an integrated gamer's marketplace denominated in micro-bitcoins that automatically converts your idle hashing time into bitcoins which you can spend in game or trade with others and withdraw at your discretion.
  It's like mixing ogrr.com with a mining pool and having it be integrated with your favorite games. You mix in an option to add "credit" (i.e. micro-bitcoins) with paypal or creditcard with a ridiculously high exchange rate..  It's very easily a mulit-million dollar market and coinlab is getting in on the ground floor by seducing gaming companies with promises of no-cost revenue from their players idle gpu s.
[edit] 
besides, the parents likely won't even know what's going on. It's like a hidden fee. It may not be moral, but it could be lucrative.  And it can't be any worse than the shit toy advertisers do to manipulate impressionable young minds into loosening their parents wallets.
@_date: 2012-06-27 18:15:55
No, its not distributed to the rest of the users, its given as a reward to the miners who are securing the network.
@_date: 2012-11-29 16:11:03
They'll give them back if you give them a hard enough time about it.  They can't just steal your bitcoins. Make some noise.  Start campaigns on Facebook and Twitter and the forums. Give them grief until they figure out a better way of enforcing AML, KYC bullshit.
Also stop using them because they suck.
@_date: 2012-04-14 19:41:17
damn, you seem to know an awful lot about the protocol. Are you a dev? And if you were, how would you deal with/prevent a 51% attack? Between  [Vladamir's Proposed mining operations]( and bitcoin mining [botnets]( I feel like any entity who decides to try to 51% bitcoin has a serious task on their hands. Not to mention a task that is way out of their element.  What branch of government specifically would take this on? The Secrete Service?  The CIA? NSA?  The NSA is the only branch I feel would be equipped for such a task. Actually now that I think about it, they could probably pull it off too.  I I guess we just have to hope they have more important things to do than mess with our little experiment until bitcoin outgrows any single government
@_date: 2012-12-21 21:12:56
These are terrific improvements.  I'm incredibly stoked with the dev team
Way to go guys!
@_date: 2012-09-28 01:15:23
Maybe, but the way of accepting the code IS decentralized.  If people don't like a code release, the miners won't switch and they'll have to create a fork. 
Standards are needed for bitcoin to be globally accessible.  If you don't like the standards created by the Bitcoin Foundation then either become a member and voice your opinion, or else create your own foundation and your own set of standards.  It's not a requirement to adhere to the Foundation's standards to use the bitcoin network, that's the beauty of the bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2012-11-29 17:24:37
Here here.  This happened to me last year.  I had to raise hell to get my bitcoins back.  This policy they have is completely illegitimate.  All their bullshit about AML compliance is just an excuse. If you can't process the bitcoins, give them back. End of Story.
@_date: 2012-06-09 19:02:08

@_date: 2012-12-20 02:40:55
That was really disheartening to read through.  Lost a ton of respect for Roger.  You'd think someone who is so invested in the bitcoin community would know better than to cause this kind of scene.

Does the site pool coins and/or have a green wallet option like Instawallet used to implement?  If so it'd be highly attractive to those looking for a way to obscure their blockchain transaction history.

I'm hoping this is the case.  I don't understand why they can't just be upfront about what the issue is.  If they were like, "Yea, Dwolla's being a bitch, better avoid dwolla withdrawals for a couple weeks till we can work something out" I wouldn't be so upset.  But Campbx does all their Dwolla transactions manually and I've never had them take more than a few hours

Gavin is the lead developer, so they will have a large influence over the future of bitcoin.  However, because of the way the protocol has been designed, anyone who dislikes a code release can simply refuse to implement it and fork the protocol.  People are free to choose whichever fork they like and free market evolution is free to take its course.  Nobody gets to say how the rest of the world uses bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-04-14 09:22:04
Yes, they could.  But the protocol could also be altered if the developers realized this was happening. 
 It'd also be pretty expensive, and it'd become more and more expensive as the popularity of bitcoin increased.  The hashing power of the bitcoin network already exceeds any one of the worlds most powerful supercomputers.  
People tend to imagine the government is keener and more organized than they really are.  I'm betting bitcoin will be one of those things where the the powers that be won't know what's going on until its too late.

@_date: 2012-04-24 05:16:00
which GPU do you think they should use?  I think the idea is to harvest the idle computing power of the millions of casual gamers out there; the 'farmville' types. If they leave the game on while they aren't playing, they'll come back to find they've accrued 'points' or whatever.
 If they were really serious, they'd be much smarter to just configure their own mining rigs.  However, I think the ratio of people who mine bitcoin, to the people who play farmville might just be enough to offset the difference in hash rates.
@_date: 2012-10-12 23:56:39
any suggestions (besides obvious typos :(
@_date: 2012-09-28 00:32:42
The Foundation has no way of controlling Bitcoin.  They can only promote it and provide a locus of cooperation for others who want it to succeed.  Decentralization is programmed into the protocol. 
@_date: 2012-04-24 16:53:56
that's why I don't think this idea is aimed at people with intense GPUs, its aimed at people who play free games and marketed as a way to give companies that make free games an alternative way to make a profit.

Mt.Gox just released a pretty decent merchant solution for bitcoin, it looks pretty simple, I'd check it out.

I just placed an order to sample their wares.  I'll try and come back with a review to say how it all went.
(edit)  They aren't using bitpay so I had to email their support after placing the order to get the bitcoin address and the the btc total which is kinda awkward, but not so bad.
(edit2) They've already responded to my email and they informed me that they are indeed in the process of working with bitpay to help make a smoother process

I'm no fan of Mt.Gox myself, but as far as getting beginners setup with bitcoin, they are by far the easiest and cheapest option available.  Pointing newbies to anything that involves the bitcoind client is begging for a frustrating experience.
  Bit-pay.com is also a valid option, but Gox is still cheaper.

Its hard to tell, but bitcoin has been on a pretty steady up-swing for the last month and it doesn't look like its slowing down yet.  consensus is that its going to go to at least 8 before any serious consolidation strikes.

If you run a node, and you own x amount of coins, you should be able to broadcast to the network that your coins are in favor of xproject, the same way that the network broadcasts coins belonging to a certain public key.

Why do think they didn't try going with zk-SNARKS?  Too difficult to implement with the BOINC system?

Then why promise to open up the program selection process to PoS voting?
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:45:24
I'm not sure I understand, obviously it wouldn't be 1 person 1 vote, the more coin you have, the larger vote you would get.  I think that actually creates a fairly effective incentive for adoption

@_date: 2011-10-12 05:29:56
They wouldn't be putting a bitcoin client on their phone, they'd be using a third party system built on bitcoin, like Flexcoin, except it'd more likely be one offered by a major exchange like gox or tradehill.
The bitcoin architecture isn't designed for being mainstream, its designed to give others a platform for building mainstream applications.  If bitcoin becomes popular, the vast majority of transactions won't take place within the bitcoin client, it will take place within paypal-like systems that are built on top of the bitcoin architecture

@_date: 2015-03-13 06:22:54
You could, it would just require a fork.  I sort of feel like if a really smart PoS consensus algorithm gets worked out that saves us all the mining waste, such a fork will probably be inevitable

It doesn't really matter what the miners and the uneducated think. All it takes is one smart group of individuals to write the fork, the rest will find thier way as they come to see the light, exactly the way the world had done with bitcoin vs existing financial institutions. The people using bitcoin will have plenty of incentive as long as the distribution method makes sense since they will automatically have the same stake they had in the preforked protocol

You have to save your Google authenticator keys separately before you do resets like that. If google backed them up automatically it would defeat the purpose since a hacker who compromises your Google account would automatically have all double factor keys. 
Greenaddress will probably reset your dual factor eventually, but they are going to be super slow and cautious about it, as they should be, since any hacker anywhere can claim to be in your shoes right now.

That  scenario might be somewhat a little analogous if Mark had taken the resume and then told OP 'Nvm, I can't help'

So why didn't you bother asking for an official comment?  Oh that's right, because you're a hack

The whole reason they 'don't allow' US accounts is so that they don't have to do any stupid verification procedures.  This is Eric Voorhees we're talking about.  The guy hates the government.

never for the length of time this kid is facing.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:57:29
Yea, but you didn't request an official comment. You're basically a bitcoin tabloid.
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:23:33
Sure, but it's not a direct fork.  Aka, I can't use the bitcoins from the previous chain on the peer coin network.  Also, while I have you here, can you explain to me how peer coin distributes their coins?
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:33:08
I don't think people in this sub realize that mining (aka proof of work) is an antiquated and wasteful system of crypto currency distribution. All the smart ones are using consensus verification methods. Hopefully bitcoin will make the switch sooner than later, but there will be zero central central government Cyptos using mining.  It's a really superfluous concept 
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:35:00
So you're saying the problem is with the distribution process? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:34:53
Everyone's giving you a lot of hate and acting like this is normal, but it's really not. The same thing happened to me and after fighting with them tooth and nail they finally relented and released my coins without forcing me to divulge more private knowledge. (I posted about the whole affair a few months ago) it sucks and I have since taken to greenwallet as my goto online hot wallet. I just want you to know I feel your pain 
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:35:19

huh. So how are there any coins that actually work with it?
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:25:47
I don't think it's negative so much as serious.  Everybody in this sub, minus the trolls, are advocates.  We all want to see bitcoin succeed and we all (hopefully) contribute where we can.  An apologist is like a professional arguer.  Nobody is going to call me up to have a televised  debate with Paul Krugman.  Yes, it has religious connotations. But lets face it, for many of us bitcoin is more than just a cool new tech, its a revolution.

How do you foresee this working with a decentralized marketplace like Openbazaar?  Have you thought of collaborating with them at all?
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:53:33
It's actually the otherway around. Coindesk is pretty much the only reliable bitcoin-oriented news source, hence they are the only ones who've actually contacted Pokerstars for a comment.  If coinfire was worth a shit they would have done this from the get-go.

All that's left is for us to get this modern marvel into the hands of the people..  and the fastest way to do this is by avoiding prohibition. Alcohol and nicotine are shitty drugs compared to marijuana but you can't get weed at 6 o' clock morning from wal-mart for $3.50

If you get how it works, then you should understand that any attempt by the government to 'register' users or apply any *real* control over bitcoin can easily be side-stepped by anyone who knows what they're doing.  Government has been trying to control the internet since its inception, the reality is that the tighter they squeeze the less they actually get a hold of.

Bitcoin has so much momentum right now, news-wise, that it requires a steady release of  "good news" just to maintain its value.  The price will only change if there is bad news or great news.  Good news is par for the course now.

Look, its simply naive to think the government is going to just leave a billion dollar economy alone.  Until the rest of the world realizes how unhealthy governments really are, we are just going to have to deal with their existence and the fact that they are going to be meddling in our shit. 
 I would much prefer that the government treat bitcoin like tobacco and alcohol rather than marijuana and cocaine.  If we push our luck and openly promote bitcoin as a tool of governmental subversion, then we are asking for a "war" that frankly I do not think would fair well for bitcoin just yet.

Yea, that's true. I guess you're right.  But being one of the core devs, a lot of people look up to you as being an authority on all things bitcoin.  With all the weight your opinion carries, don't you feel some responsibility to maintain a higher degree of objectivity and inclusiveness when addressing the public forum?  
You're obviously incredibly intelligent and passionate about your views and the points you make in your arguments are all valid, but from an outside observer, it doesn't quite seem fair to reduce SD to nothing more than "an attack on the network" or to give Litecoin the label of Ponzi even if their vices do outweigh their virtues

It's called automated fraud assessment. Stop blaming coinbase for a problem in the US banking system. Nothing was stolen from you. Read their  terms of service. Something about your transaction triggered a flag and the transaction was cancelled. 
 If you had to fight off the amount of fraud they deal with everyday you would have done the same exact thing. Go try making your own ACH exchange platform if you don't believe me.
Obviously coinbase doesn't work for you, there are other ways of obtaining bitcoins. Go use them.

Look, I don't really have a problem with your speculations, I also agree that it will continue to rise, just please stop using the term "bubble"


If you've been calling it a bubble the whole time its been rising, you've been wrong because bubbles pop.  If you don't think its going to pop sooner than later, then you don't think its a bubble.  "semantics" are important because without them, we have no idea what other people are trying to say.  Don't waste the term "bubble" on what is better described as a rebound.
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:29:05
I'm not talking about bitcoin behavior I'm talking about incorrect terminology.  This isn't a bubble because the price has not even exceeded the price of the last "bubble" which was only a few months ago.  When the price goes over $200 we can start discussing whether or not the term "bubble" might be appropriate

This^  I went all in on bitcoin back in 2011 (when it was $20 unfortunately).  EVERYBODY told me I was an idiot and for a while I almost began to believe them, but I really believed in the technology so I rode it out and I told them if it ends up being a bust, no biggie. I've got no to family support, my bills are manageable and I've got my whole life to earn it all back again. Carpe Diem!

What exactly would Paypal have done?  They aren't mediation court, they can't make the company pay.  What if the company was going to pay with credit card or bank transfer?
 The company probably just paid because they didn't want the fuss or the mark on their record.  There are plenty of ways to keep people honest without paypal, Including small claims courts, and Business Bureaus, not to mention that Bitcoin has third party escrow built in so if you don't trust the party you're dealing with, you can find a part you both trust to ensure that both parties hold up their ends of the deal before anyone get any money.  
Face it, bitcoin is simply superior money in every fathomable way and in the future everybody is going to start seeing it

You sound like a doctor, or someone who listens to doctors way too much.  How did doctors become experts?  They studied. Aka research.  Where does information come from?  The internet is the largest pool of information available.  There is nothing that a doctor has that I can't get access to.
Between Google and my local Labcorp, I've never failed to correctly diagnose my condition.  However, I've had doctors with elitist attitudes like you're exuding right now completely botch several.

There is still plenty of unabashed ignorance out there, but overall the past year the reputation of bitcoin and the community has been steadily improving.

I'd certainly prefer that Ripple become open source like they are saying they'll do eventually, but I understand why they'd want to retain control until they procure a larger lead in the 'network effect'.
  Again, for the end user it doesn't really matter the price of XRP, very few people, if anyone, are going to invest in XRP.  The people using Ripple are going to be using most national fiat and probably bitcoin, which is great for bitcoin because it provides a seamless platform for exchanging bitcoin for local currency. 


So far, that's exactly what they've done.  It's not meant to 'secure transactions'  It's meant to be anti-spam, so they're trying to make sure its distributed in a way that one person can't somehow end up with all the XRP. 
(Edit) I agree its sketchy that they are keeping such a large portion of XRP for themselves, but as of yet, I don't really have a problem with it.  The elegance of the protocol is still apparent.
@_date: 2013-07-02 17:45:41
Dude, I seriously used to have so much respect for you until you went bat-shit trying to convince everyone Ripple is a scam and reflex posting these links everywhere.  Can you just chill?  
Ripple is different than bitcoin, it might not be structured as transparently as bitcoin right now, but to call it a scam is akin to the buttcoin derps calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme.
(Disclaimer: I am not invested in Ripple, nor do I plan to be.  However, I do believe it might provide another way for bitcoin to gain greater penetration into the mainstream

You're best bet is to just start it.  There is very little information about how such things are supposed to be regulated, but unless you start making a ton of exchanges (like as much as mtgox) which doesn't seem likely for a while at least, it doesn't seem like people are going to care.  By the time people do start caring, hopefully you'll have made enough money to be able to hire a good lawyer to sort it all out for you.
Ideally, if you already have a storefront/business license for something else, there shouldn't be anything left to do but add your exchange service and advertise.
If not, start advertising on localbitcoins at a markup you think will be sustainable and see what the demand is

Coinbase has over 700,000 customers right now, this is a great.  If even just 10% of them use this feature, it will be money well spent.  Every die-hard bitcoin proponent with a US bank account will want to use this feature since it means that we can spend bitcoin without diminishing our bitcoin savings or spend a lot of time manually replenishing.

In fact I'm in the process of launching my own bitcoin-centered blog for travelers. 
I understand it can be a painstaking and highly competitive endeavor.  
What I have a problem with is shit-quality pieces and mindlessly re-posted news being played off as "analysis".  If any of these "little guys" think they are benefiting the community by plastering their SEO directed noise in they need a swift kick in the rear.  I'm pretty sure most of them are self-aware enough to know they are just doing it for the traffic ratings. (I'm looking at you onbitcoin/bitcoinnews)
If you want to publish high-quality, well-researched content, I'm all for it.  In my opinion, this piece does not achieve such honors for the reasons listed by the guy I initially responded to.
I realize that I've come off as quite a dick and I honestly feel kind of bad about that.  That said, if you want something constructive, I recommend submitting a couple articles to some of the more established publishers (Bitcoinmagazine and Coindesk routinely publish guest content) to guarantee quality control and make a name for yourself.  That way you're not making bad first impressions while you're getting your feet wet.

Even though I subscribe to many libertarian/ancap ideas about individual freedom, I'm really beginning to get sick of the unbridled politicization on this subreddit. Bitcoin can work just as well within a socialist context as it can with capitalism and anything in between. The blockchain is completely public and can be used by the government to enforce taxes if they need to. Yes there can still be laundering, but just like today with cash, most people won't risk it. Bitcoin is a needed revolution in money, not politics. Although just like any powerful technology, it can become a fierce political tool, I personally despise the people that choose to use it that way

Just use a third-party wallet. A trusted third-party wallet is 100x safer than a computer noob trying to do bitcoin on their own. If they want to go into more detail, let them do it on their own.

Blockchain.info and inputs.io are also very decent

I'm not-so-curiously frustrated with everyone here hating on Ripple for no reason other than "They're not really open source".  An argument which has nothing to do with the fact that Ripple still allows people to get a hold of bitcoins via ACH transfer

no.. 30btc was the price back in november when btc was still $12.  If you want dividends you can get access via coinbr or havelockinvestments or you can bitfinex.com and lend your btc to day-traders or do the same at Kraken which announced it was opening soon

I think the fact that Ripple doesn't require any mining is one of its most attractive features as an alt-coin. 
 Sure, I'll grant that the distribution can be critical to the success of a cryptocoin system,  But thus far I don't have any problem with how the coins have been distributed. 
 Also it doesn't sound like XRP is really supposed to be a currency the same way that bitcoin is, considering that they focus on letting people trade and exchange the entire spectrum of existing currencies, as well as create their own.

For a lot of people, storing bitcoin at coinbase with double authentication is a hell of a lot safer than using the default client.  The chances of coinbase running off with or losing your bitcoins are a lot lower than the chances of your computer getting hacked or forgetting your password or deleting/not backing up your wallet if you're a complete computer noob.


It's true enough.  6 confirmations is an arbitrary number picked by a lot of people to secure without a fraction of a doubt the transaction.  In reality, 1 confirmation is more than 99.99% secure and there are very few instances of people trying to pull double-spend attacks. For small value transactions I'd take 0 confirmations anytime as long as I had no reason to be suspect

open up as many lines of credit as you can, then go to a bank or a WU and get cash advances on all of them and use the cash to pay off your student loans and then try filing for bankruptcy.
The problem is your credit is probably not so hot considering you already have such a large debt. I can't imagine you getting anywhere near the $40,000 you'd need to pay off the student loan..

I will concede that surgery and the like requires training and practice that I wouldn't attempt without, but I still think US is over kill with the amount of responsibility it reserves to 'experts'.  
Believe it or not, I care enough about my life to do enough research to know which drugs will help me and which will do harm, and if I'm really uncertain then will consult an expert.  Besides, I hate the idea of protecting people from themselves, if they really need so much nannying, maybe its better to let natural selection take its course.

They don't all have to be in Japan. 175 might be an exaggeration, but the point is they had a bank that was working fine for a long time. Now all of a sudden there's a problem and 3 months later they still can't find a single bank that will process more than 10 international wires/day?  There is something super fishy going on.
(edit) I'm obviously speculating with no proof or real knowledge to back up my conspiracy theories, stuff just doesn't feel right and Mt. Gox isn't releasing a lot of information on the matter.  Poor liquidity seems as good a reason as any for the issues they are experiencing

It sounds like they are pretty much counting on the bitcoin price going up.  What if it falls? 
From an investing point of view it seems better to just hold on to bitcoin since the risks are lower (assuming that both bitcoin and NEO profitability depend on increasing bitcoin prices) and they yields would be higher (assuming that bitcoin price increases are indeed NEO's primary source of income as is stated)

Personally, I think there will become a bunch of alt-coins coming into existence, one of which will figure out a way to keep the distribution of coins equal with the growth of the economy and loans will be conducted in this new currency, and probably everyone will just switch over to this currency eventually.

The wallet.dat includes a lot of information, but the important information is the private keys.

A bubble is an irrational speculating inflation of price.  It means the price doesn't line up with the actual value of the commodity.  "The beginning of a bubble" means not yet in a bubble because you're predicting the price to go up, not down.  All the people calling "Bubble" in February and March were wrong, especially since the price still has not returned to those prices. The bubble occurred in April.  If you're calling "bubble" now, you're saying the price is about to drop.

No.. that's not how they work.

They don't handle it in the same way.  I'm not sure if you've ever dealt with Mtgox/dwolla/paypal, but all of them will *actually* steal your funds and refuse to return them until you surrender enough information for them to completely abscond with your identity.  To my knowledge, Coinbase hasn't started this practice.
What OP is complaining about is a cancelled transaction and lost time.  Compared to what could have happened, this is trivial.

I'm very familiar with Erik and his multiple enterprises.  I've been following his involvement with the bitcoin community for over two years.   I've always found him remarkably rational and insightful and I've never found him guilty of any actions I would consider unethical or "bad" for bitcoin.
I was really just hoping you'd offer something akin to a "point" for being upset so I could grind it into the belligerent mush that it is with some old fashioned logic.

Review so far:
Everything seems to be going smoothly. The process is pretty straight forward although it would be nice if I could somehow just click "book this" in the hotels.com iframe and have all the relevant information (hotel name/address/roomtype) auto-filled for me.
The price on Hotels.com was about $3 more expensive than the same hotel/room on Agoda.com, so not bad, but it'd be nice if we could choose our booking agent.
The bitcoin exchange rate given by hotelsforcoins.com was about 5% lower than spot and 3% lower than the 24h average.  Hotels in Thailand are pretty cheap so the difference was only like $1.50 which really isn't too bad considering I get to use bitcoin, however I'd be a bit more disconcerted if I were making a $200+ reservation.
The payment processing time was reasonable. It took 27 minutes from the time I got the payment confirmation from Coinbase to the time I received the booking confirmation from hotelsforcoins.  If you do a lot of  budget hotel shopping like I do, this can be a bit worrying because often times the best deals/locations will only be available for an hour or two before they get booked and it could be a bit disappointing to find a killer deal only to lose it to the added processing time.
So far I'm very pleased with the service and don't expect any hiccups at the check in, if there are I'll make an edit here

Coinbase is not an exchange, its a broker. When you place an order, the buy for you on an exchange and hold the Bitcoins until your money arrives so they can replenish their USD on the exchanges. Right now, they probably have no USD on the exchanges because everyone has been buying so fast they haven't had time to replenish. If that changes you'll be able to buy again

If you wanted a fair take, you should have made a better first impression.  There are way too many competing outlets to be introducing fluff pieces like this.  I have to sift through crap from onbitcoin, bitcoinoutpost, bitcoinbulletin, thegenisisblock, coindesk, bitcoinnotbombs, forexminute, letstalkbitcoin, forexstrikervideo, bitcoinstarter, bitcoinprbuzz, codinginmysleep.. and that's just in the top two pages.  
The vast majority of the shit on these sites are reposts of legitimate news and pot-shot arm-chair 'analysis'  Can I afford to waste precious time sifting though hundred of articles that say next to nothing? Well, maybe, but that's just because I occasionally have a retarded amount of time on my hands to procrastinate with.
The point is, your market is flooded.  If you're not going to bother standing out, prepare to sink into obscurity (and receive undue hostility from myself when I'm feeling particularly grumpy and fed-up with all the bitcoin hacks)
(edit) Just wanted to say of all the above, Coindesk is easily my favorite.  They are obviously hiring talented writers who are making an effort at putting some 'Economist-esque' consideration into their content. The Genisis Block and Coding in my Sleep also produce some worthy OC, but I'm not really into mining so most of their content evades my interests.

You're comment is kind of an ideal example of why more female representation would be beneficial for our community.  Woman comprise 50% of the population, if they don't feel represented, they are less likely to participate in the community.  
My opinion is that, as far as ITT goes, gender presents a much more significant gap in representation than ethnicity.

You've pretty much got the gist of it.
 Though it might also be worth mentioning that the bitcoin community also contains a high percentage of OCD syntax nazis who will pounce on any opportunity to correct a mistake.  It might feel a bit abrasive at first, but you get used it and ultimately it keeps us all on our toes ;)

It doesn't increase the costs, but if you use bitcoin instead of USD at a business that doesn't give a discount for bitcoin, then you are losing 1% on every transaction.  I think of this as an investment in the bitcoin economy that will eventually make my bitcoin savings worth more and therefore well worth it.

Thanks, that was actually a really informative article.. 
 I'm still not sure whether we're seeing the end of the recession or not.  On one hand, there have only been 4 chapter 9 municipal filings this year compared to 25 in the last two years, on the other hand, Detroit is easily the largest government entity to go bankrupt so far, by a large margin.
I guess your point was that this isn't really the beginning, its been happening for years now.  Still seems pretty crazy to think about

All the good ones have been taken down. Campbx accepts money orders and Dwolla and maybe local wire transfers which might be cheaper than international transfers.

the sidebar links represents a very narrow spectrum of political ideology.  The fact that these ideologies are being promoted by the mods while all the others are neglected is an example of ideological bias, which is inherently limiting.  OP is advocating the elimination of any particular political avocation, which would go a long way towards keeping bitcoin's image objective.

First of all, no.  Acaps don't run bitcoin. people run bitcoin.  some of those people are ancaps.  I am an ancap, but I'm not so arrogant as to suppose bitcoin couldn't exist without my ideology.  It most certainly could.
Second of all, this subreddit is supposed to be exactly a "cross section of bitcoin's user-base" and exactly not "A small sampling of redditors dabbling in the world of anarcho capitalism"  That's the entire point of OP's post.  The two top mods in this subreddit are very vocal about their political agenda, and OP is suggesting that bitcoin as a whole and therefore this subreddit would be better off if it wasn't so blatantly politicized.  I agree with this despite having political leanings that align very nicely with the mods and the ancap population of this subreddit.

These questions have been asked and answered a bazillion times (we like exaggerating here).
1.)  People have been expressing this concern since early 2011.    Those who ignored it became wealthy.  If you´re not into bitcoin because of its revolutionary potential, you shouldn´t be into bitcoin.
2.) Everyone is crying about volatility, but its really not an issue. I hold my savings in bitcoins and I keep a portion of my income in a ¨spending wallet¨so when I need something that I can buy with bitcoin, I do so.  This portion is becoming larger and larger as bitcoin becomes more and more accepted. Everything is automatically priced in USD and automatically converted using real-time exchange apis.  Honestly volatility has never been anything but a blessing for me

This is really only true for those looking for total social upheaval.  I'm not anti-radical, but most people are inline with "the current regime" so if we're going to appeal to the mainstream, it makes sense to speak their language.

Again, it appears obvious you've never used Mt.Gox if you are going to try comparing them to relatively excellent services like Coinbase or Bitstamp.

That's not what it sounded like from the complaint.  They listed as their evidence that they got the IP of a VPS DPR used from the server they had grabbed, which means they had control of the server before they started tracking his webtraffic (theoretically)  There isn't any explanation at all in the complaint about how exact they were able to locate SR's server

I've used them too.  The prices are not quite as good as amazons, though not too bad.  The browsing is quite a bit more awkward than amazon.  It's much harder to narrow your search results to get what you're looking for.  And although the catalogued # impressive in number, the search function is really terrible and has mentionted, its a bit cumbersome to navigate it all.
it has a lot of potential though and the support is great.  Product arrived very quickly and in great shape. Would recommend if you're wanting to support the bitcoin economy

I'm not sure how that means it will crash.. Sure, if bitcoin were a mandatorily enforced currency like government fiat, then deflation could be a big problem, but it's not. It's a voluntary alternative with some promising features, it definitely won't ever be the only currency in use, but it's conceivable given it's unique benefits that it will continue to grow in popularity and use and become part of a larger alternative currency economy

the characters are all random. I hopped on the btc-dev channel as soon as it happened and together we all went over the math and determined it would take some hundred million years with a super-computer to crack it.
They were actually really nice about it and mentioned even considering implementing some kind of back-door key that could only be used on a wallet if all the devs got a partial key, but honestly I'd rather have learned an expensive lessen than add that kind of centralization to the system.  Besides, back then it was only a couple hundred dollars.

It's not mandatory.  If you don't like the service, don't use it.  There are plenty of people who've been scammed who wish there was an escrow service to help mitigate their risks.  There's nothing wrong with making scams more difficult to pull off and thus less lucrative for scammers.

just because I miner is willing to to mine for low fees, doesn't mean they will get the block.  What is more likely to happen is that as miners decide they don't want to bother with fee-less transactions, people will start paying more for the fast transactions instead of having to wait for a cheaper miner to finally win a block

At first I was thinking that since bitcoin has escrow capabilities built in, we could have the WASP site administer merely be given the ability to make a decision when there is a dispute, but not actually be able to control the funds.
But of course that leaves open the issue of mixing the coins and being able to trust the operator of the mixing service. Is there even a way to create a trust-less mixing service with bitcoin? Or are we going to have to rely on the development of open transactions or zero-coin for anonymity?

Just because one of Google's financial subsidies invested in Ripple doesn't mean they had anything to do with producing the code.

It's fucking open source now. How much more transparent can you get?


No, it's been positioned as a compliment, hence why bitcoin is the highest used currency on the Ripple network..


This is 100% wrong.  You don't seem to understand anything about the Ripple protocol.  The only centralized component right now are that the Ripple developers are controlling the validation nodes on *their* network and they specifically say that this is a temporary phase while the product is still being developed.  It is entirely possible for anyone to run a Ripple network where anyone can run a validation node and hence have a completely decentralized network.  Please give me one instance where the bitcoin protocol is superior to the Ripple protocol and I will shut up.  Please.  I'm getting tired of this debate already

True. I guess I'm just uncomfortable with people demanding bitcoin discounts. It makes sense for merchants who really want to get their hands on some bitcoins or want to promote the bitcoin economy but for the average business, I feel like having community expectations of discounts might diminish the luster of accepting bitcoin.
Honestly I'm more than stoked to merely have businesses offering services for bitcoin at spot.

I think the saving grace for bitcoin that most authors like this don't take into account are that bitcoin is open source and constantly evolving, when serious problems arise, solutions will eventually be found.  Also, the bitcoin protocol should be thought of primarily as a base-level protocol, like TCP-IP.  The internet didn't really start showing its promise until HTML and other higher languages started taking advantage of the the internet's true potential

presuming the most recent 0-confirmation bug has been fixed, it would be incredibly difficult to pull off a 0-confirmation double-spend. The occurrence of such a fraud would be infinitesimal compared with cash counterfeiting or credit card fraud.  The only sort of "brick and mortar" establishments that would really need to practice confirmation observation are the ones that would deal with really valuable stuff like cars or whatever and such transactions usually take time anyway for paperwork or whatnot.

I have to concede your argument.
However, I still think there's a point to be made in the fact that SR and the US government were in such direct political opposition to each other that a kind of dichotomy can be drawn.    
After all, there is obviously no third party to step in and hold the US government accountable for crimes they commit and it is completely in their interest to eliminate the kinds of societies that DPR espoused and was apparently trying to bring to fruition.  If we let something like an alleged (and arguably entrapped) hired hit shake shift our support from the man who opposed the US government to the government who is now prosecuting him, it leaves us wide open to all kinds of sinister social manipulations.
Because of the political reality DPR existed in when he allegedly called for those hits (a reality created and brutaly enforced by the US government), he was essentially choosing between the life of blackmailer and the lives of himself and some number of the SR community.  I AM NOT SAYING HE MADE A MORAL DECISION, but I believe that there are few people, certainly nobody within the leadership of our current government who would have chosen differently. 
 If I had to choose between between DPR and Obama as a world leader given the all the evidence available, I would choose DPR as I believe him to be a person of far greater morals.
Also, just as a side, I really appreciate your replies because they make me think much harder about what I actually believe so thank you for engaging me.

If you look up [alternative currency]( you'll see that there are plenty of popular alternatives to government fiat, many that have been around for years.  Liberty Dollars were taken out on counterfeiting charges, there is no law against issuing your own currency as long as its not being passed off as USD.  
Sure, the charges drummed up against liberty dollars were completely BS and the government might be able to make a law against bitcoin, but  currencies like Pecunix, Webmoney, E-Gold, and Lindon Dollars have existed for years longer than bitcoin, make up a far greater share of the e-currency market, have been used for equally sketchy transactions and are far easier logistics-wise to shut down than Bitcoin but they are all still thriving.

It depends on how serious the offence is. If they kidnap someone important, they would be idiots to use bitcoin for random. The NSA would watch those coins like hawks and they would almost certainly be able to track them back eventually. Those coins are useless unless you spend them and the first transaction you make opens up a whole new entity via which to profile you. You'd have to be extremely clever and dupe some other criminally minded person into anonymously swapping your coins for something truly untraceable, like cash or gold.

It's a little late for that now, all the speculators reading your business plan are frothing at the mouth because you're essentially a whale who is announcing your entrance into the market months ahead of time.

I completely agree with the parallel construction.  Nothing else explains how they located the SR server in the first place.
Isn't there that open source wasp project for underground marketplaces?  I feel like if it were as easy to set up a site like SR as it is to just throw up a hidden service, we could have thousands of competing marketplaces.  The only problem is then being able to trust the successful ones not to run away with the escrow pot.  Maybe we could make a distributed, trust-less escrow system that all the opensource market-places could utilize without putting any single person in control of that much money.

I think this is probably the best criticism of bitcoin that I've come across and I'm really impressed to see the quality of debate here.  I haven't thought about this problem as hard as I should, but I believe that the counterproductive effects of volatility will be reduced by the introduction of things like bitcoin futures and that the voluntary nature of the bitcoin philosophy will give rise to complimentary systems and crypto-currency solutions that will allow for a more fluid response to such fluctuations

Listen, it doesn't matter if he was the fucking dictator of the company, what he did

Damn dude, look. I think Roger is awesome. He's the greatest bitcoin evangelist there has ever been.  But you have to be able to call a breach of trust when it's laid out so clearly.
 Everyone who has read Blockchain.info's privacy policy has the right to believe it will be respected no matter what kind of personal vendetta a partial owner might have. Roger had no right to use his admin access to beach that policy. PERIOD. I don't care if it was $60^10.  Just because he owns half of the bitcoin world does not give him the license to ignore an individual user's right to privacy. 
 In fact, I would argue that the very fact that he is so incredibly influential in our community would lead us to able to expect him to go above and beyond in regards to honoring privacy rights that a large proportion of the bitcoin community holds especially sacred.
I'm a huge fan of Roger. But that doesn't mean I'm just going to let him slide when he fucks up. I respect him way too much not to hold him accountable to the position of leadership that he is taking on.
(edit) that said, you're right. He apologized and that should be the end of it. The asshole at the top of this thread who started raking all this mud better have satisfied his jollies

I think the biggest question to ask yourself is, "why not?"
Coinbase makes the set-up process fairly mild.  There's not really any maintenance or start-up costs and while bitcoin may not immediately be your bread-and-butter, its got a ton a of potential and its definitely one of those "the early the better" kind of things.  Honestly, I'm racking my brain and I can't think of any reason not to implement bitcoin other than laziness

If coinbase fails, it's because they broke some law or had a serious security breach, they aren't lending out your bitcoins on risky loans hoping to make a nice profit.  With Banks on the other hand, you don't know.  All the depositors in Cypress thought their funds would be ok until the government decided the failing banks should pay their debts with their clients money..
Also Coinbase uses much better security than most online banking that I've used.  If a hacker steals your identity and drains your accounts you can hope the bank will take responsibility and magically fix it all, but most likely your still in for an uphill legal battle, best case.

I think there's an argument to be made that DPR was acting in self-defense given that (in his mind) his targets posed a very real threat to him and the lives of many in the SR community.
Also, the laws by which the upper echelon of the US government operate are not transparent or open to reproach by us citizens as has been made painfully clear by the recent NSA leaks.  The evidence on DPR, if it is indeed legitimate, comes from his most secret communications.  If we were privy to that level of 'insideness' on the part of the heads of our state, I doubt that there would be anything less sinister.

Since bitcoin has escrow capabilities built in, we could have the WASP site administer merely be given the ability to make a decision when there is a dispute, but not actually be able to control the funds.
Of course that leaves open the issue of mixing the coins and being able to trust the operator of the mixing service.  Is there even a way to create a trust-less mixing service with bitcoin? Or are we going to have to rely on the development of open transactions or zero-coin for anonymity?

I think Ripple is really going to be bitcoin 2.0 (not the currency, the protocol)  I don't think it will necessarily kill bitcoin, in fact I believe it will help bitcoin become more widely accepted, however I do believe that the currency of the future is going to look a lot more like Ripple than Bitcoin.
The thing I really like about Ripple:  It's inclusive, so it works very well with all currencies and easily lets people create their own currencies and credit.  This makes it much more flexible and gives it a bit more utility than bitcoin. It also means that people like Krugman will like it because, "You want a stable but inflationary currency that a small group of people can control? Here, knock your socks off and make any kind of currency you like.  We'll see what kind of money the people prefer.."
 I also like that they did away with mining since I'm a bit worried about how bitcoin mining will sustain itself in the future, although to be honest, I still have no idea how their consensus system actually works and nobody seems to be able to give me an explanation as clear as I can understand bitcoin.
The things I don't really like include:
1.)  The fact that I still really don't understand it at all
2.) All the power that the creators are giving themselves to distribute the currency.  I would really like to see them succeed, but I don't think its a very good idea to centralize the distribution process like that.  
3.)  From what I understand, Ripples (XRP) completely disappear as they are used, which begs the question: What do we do when they run out?  I imagine we have to create more, but I don't understand how the creators intend to do this, Although I do understand that this will take a very long time to happen which gives us plenty of time to figure it out, which is basically the answer that the bitcoin devs are giving us about questions about mining rewards/sustainability/block sizes etc..
4.) Finally, I haven't the faintest idea how to fund my goddamn Ripple account with anything (USD, BTC, etc..) let alone how to obtain Ripples.  
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:52:46
No, that's not what it means, coinbase purchases the coins at the time you place the order and then waits for the funds to actually arrive before releasing them. Of course I can understand why some people might speculate this
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:56:35
Sweet.  I'm going to try it out right now and put up a review for the community :)
Review so far:
Everything seems to be going smoothly. The process is pretty straight forward although it would be nice if I could somehow just click "book this" in the hotels.com iframe and have all the relevant information (hotel name/address/roomtype) auto-filled for me.
The price on Hotels.com was about $3 more expensive than the same hotel/room on Agoda.com, so not bad, but it'd be nice if we could choose our booking agent.
The bitcoin exchange rate given by hotelsforcoins.com was about 5% lower than mtgox spot and 3% lower than the 24h average. Hotels in Thailand are pretty cheap so the difference was only like $1.50 which really isn't too bad considering I get to use bitcoin, however I'd be a bit more disconcerted if I were making a $200+ reservation.
The payment processing time was reasonable. It took 27 minutes from the time I got the payment confirmation from Coinbase to the time I received the booking confirmation from hotelsforcoins. If you do a lot of budget hotel shopping like I do, this can be a bit worrying because often times the best deals/locations will only be available for an hour or two before they get booked and it could be a bit disappointing to find a killer deal only to lose it to the added processing time.
So far I'm very pleased with the service and don't expect any hiccups at the check in, if there are I'll make an edit here

I probably would if I could get wind of such an opportunity, it's a lot more convenient to just buy/hold bitcoins since any break-through in a protocol interface will likely lead to an uptick in use which should also have a positive impact on price thanks to bitcoin's restricted supply

Seriously?  Ripple is intimately connected with bitcoin in numerous ways.  It's founders are hardcore bitcoiners with several bitcoin projects, it's protocol specifically implements bitcoin, bitcoin is the single largest currency conveyed via its network and hell, bitcoin is overtly mentioned over 3 times in the announcement.  
I'm pretty sure with all the crap that gets submitted to this thread, the argument for this announcement being relevant to bitcoin is one of the stronger ones.

Listen, like I said, I'm a huge fan of Roger. He's the greatest bitcoin evangelist there has ever been.  That doesn't change the fact that he abused his power and breached the trust blockchain.info's user base placed in their privacy policy.  Where I'm from, that's a serious grievance.  If that happened at a real-word bank, there would be a lawsuit at hand. 
All I wanted to say is that what he did was not "an itty bitty, easily justifiable in the right context "bad thing"" I'm not attacking Roger, I'm attacking the idea that just because someone is important they don't have to be accountable for their actions.

Coinbase is by far the easiest and most painless, and yes, its as simple as creating a paypal account. Give them an email and a bank account. It takes 3-5 days to confirm the bank account and 3-5 days for each transfer.
for two non-users it goes like this:
Japan user creates mtgox acount, wires money to mtgox via domestic transfer ($5?), exchanges for bitcoins (0.5% fee) sends bitcoins directly to US non-user coinbase account who exchanges for USD(1%) and withdraws to bank account (free)

Like Gold, Bitcoin has a limited supply, so its not going to be insanely devalued like government fiat.  It's price, like gold, is going to steadily increase.
Gold and Silver are unattractive as a medium of exchange because they are not as convenient as digital options. They are great for long-term investments.
You can't pay someone in gold from your Iphone.  That's the advantage that bitcoin has. 
 The only thing Gold has over bitcoin is that it's been around longer.  But if you look into the cryptographic fundamentals of bitcoin, you'll see that there is enough "sound monetary policy" to have significant potential as a currency

A lot of us were hoping that the big start-up ventures like Coinbase and Coinsetter and Bitinstant would have made more visible progress by this time, but things still feel as bad (maybe even a little worse with Gox losing its Dwolla connection) as they were 2 months ago and so a lot of the enthusiasm has dwindled

The point is that A.) this means we can easily shop at stores overseas with our US bank account and, more importantly, B.) we are supporting the bitcoin economy, encouraging more merchants to accept bitcoin, and increasing the value of our bitcoin reserves, which is worth far more than the paltry 1% conversion fee we are paying.

The price is increasing much faster than the general economy, this is merely a product of poor liquidity resulting from a lack of reliable exchanges.  I'm really hoping some good exchanges start launching soon because we need them direly.  If that happens before the end of the year, I'd guesstimate bitcoin prices approaching $1000 by 2015
@_date: 2013-02-23 08:31:06
I agree. Some of the shit that comes out of bitcoiners makes me cringe.  Change doesn't always require Armageddon, bitcoin is a proof of concept.  It's voluntary and anyone can choose to participate.  It doesn't need to be a threat to government and I don't see any reason for the government to interfere as long as nobody jumps the gun and starts declaring war.  There's no precedent for judging bitcoin and as long as everyone keeps a level head it should be perfectly easy to work out a win-win for everyone involved.

Because we want more people to use it!
Bitcoin can't actually be controlled or regulated by governments, but if we let the people in government pretend like they do control it, then they won't run around being such a pain in our ass.
People who harp against bitcoin regulation either don't understand how bitcoin works, or else are so extremely anti-government that they just hate the idea of government being associated with their beloved bitcoin.
It's really stupid.  It's like saying drugs are better when they are illegal and government isn't involved in regulating them.  Drugs are drugs.  If you don't like the way the government regulates your drugs, you can always go to the blackmarket and get them in their unregulated form; but that doesn't mean drugs are better off being illegal.

Alright, I'll drop the mixing. 
(disclaimer: I was using the term kids in the broadest sense of the term.  I still consider myself and my generation all kids)
If I understand correctly, [BitWasp]( seems to be aimed at tackling the code issues.  There should be someway for users to verify that the code used is in fact trust-able.
I don't know if I understand your issue with Tor hosting.  I agree its concerning how the feds located the SR server in the first place, but I think they probably used some illegal NSA surveillance to narrow their targets and then monitored all of them until they figured out where DPR was keeping his server, and then they just parallel constructed everything to make it legit.  I think this will become less of an option when there are thousands of websites like SR running around the deepnet.
A good site administrator would set up multiple servers around the world and keep the site constantly on the move.  I think its likely that an entire economy will build up around people offering networks of anonymous VPSs with encrypted drives than not even the physical owner can easily tamper with (or better yet, even be aware of).
PGP is really the only viable solution to secure messaging.  Everyone should get used to using as much as possible and there should be more apps that make this process easier for the end-user.
Tor node flooding shouldn't be too much a problem.  If SR was smart, he'd have allocated 5%-10% of the profits to setting up secure remote relays.  It's like the bitcoin network, there is strength in numbers and if we all pitch in we can prevent an single actor from taking control.
I'm pretty sure everyone has learned their lesson from DPR about keeping your darknet ID completely disinfected.  It's easy for us to give him shit about it now, but back then SR wasn't shit and even if he had emailed his ID directly to the FBI they wouldn't have bothered with him.  His real mistake was not getting the hell out of dodge once SR began to take off.
I still think the biggest issue is getting a escrow system that doesn't give a thirdparty complete control of the funds, like you mentioned earlier.  Worst case scenario being the minors get the disputed funds or whatever.  
The guy running the site makes a decent living facilitating transactions and mediating disputes but can't run off with a million dollar escrow pot. This way reputable dealers can set up shop anywhere, identified by their public keys, and if anything does happen to the site, no harm done, just move over to the place across the street.  
Customers are protected by the WoT and PGP.  There will probably even be a separate decentralized rating hub where the reputations of venders are catalogued and updated

People who think republicans are using the threat of default to force Obama to compromise on budget issues.  If the country defaults it's bad for everybody and the blame falls largely on Obama's head.
Some people think the trillion dollar coin is an elegant solution for Obama because it gives him some wiggle room to deal with stubborn republicans.
Obviously it's a silly idea, but note that it's not the same as dumping a trillion dollars on the market since the coin would merely be deposited at the federal reserve and wouldn't go into circulation, it's just a way to put off the pressure of the debt ceiling until a satisfactory budget plan can be reached.

I don't want to harp on Bitstamp, but their regulatory preparation so far (at least as has been publicly released) is abysmal.  On the exact same level as Mt.Gox.  The only reason they haven't received a smack-down like Gox is because they were never big enough.  Now they are about to wear the crown and I certainly hope they have learned a lesson from Mt.Gox, but I haven't yet seen anything to convince me

I'm not sure I completely understand.  You want a tor alternative?
I feel like Tor will work fine as long as the marketplace itself is highly decentralized..
Although now that I'm thinking about it..  What if there were some way to take each aspect of SR, isolate and decentralize it.  A decentralized marketplace that wasn't really run by anyone but used a basic shopping cart system and user submitted data to connect venders with buyers and trusted third-person moderators for escrow disputes.  Fees would go to paying the moderators and the hosting fees and secure amount of nodes.  
Venders could list their wares and prove their identities via PGP, it wouldn't matter what site you visited because they'd all be getting their data from a single decentralized source, just like the bitcoin blockchain works. 
Reputation and trust would easily be implemented via the WoT.
 Hell, anybody could list anything, the concept would actually work incredibly well for just about anyone.  It'd be like a decentralized Ebay, with lower fees and the venders and buyers could choose from a multitude of moderators who would also receive WoT identities and ratings from the community and get to pick the fees they charge.
Fuck, you're right.  It wouldn't even be dependent on Tor.  It could be used in conjunction with any anonymizing service.
If the protocal is set-up right, it'd be impossible for LE to take down any more than they could take down Tor or Bitcoin.  It's free-fucking software than anyone can download and run.
 Damn dude, you're blowing my mind right now

@_date: 2013-10-07 10:20:02
I'm totally in agreement with having an decentralized mixing system that can't be targeted and made some kind of Achilles heal
All I'm trying to say is in order for the market to be successful, there has to be anonymity and ideally we want something where we don't have to trust any third parties (like we did with SR)  
Having everybody just figure it out for themselves is going create (in my opinion) an unnecessarily high barrier to entry and fuck over a lot of kids who didn't do enough research or possibly just had back luck with their decisions.  
This is why I'm beginning to think that an alternative currency protocol like Open Transactions or ZeroCoin might actually be the answer.  Once these aggressively anonymous protocols are in place, it should be relatively trivial to convert Fiat --&gt; Bitcoin (which is becoming more and more heavily monitored and less and less anonymous) --&gt; A far more anonymity friendly currency protocol.

Justcoin is a bitcoin exchange.  Considering about 30% of the material posted on this sub is junk, I think that's relevant enough to qualify.

What I think a lot of people who are worried about the "legality" of bitcoin need to realize is that the use of bitcoin breaks absolutely no law what-so-ever and an attempt to ban it would require some seriously painstaking legislating that would be almost impossible to mask as anything other than a breach of the 1st amendment.  Such a law would stand a worse chance than SOPA.
The US seriously wanted to ban public use of military-grade cryptography on the grounds that the technology was a tool for mass destruction.  It was the entire executive and legislative branches of the government against 1 lonely cryptographer and the little man won. 
If people want a case precedent for bitcoin, that's where they need to look. The day legislation against bitcoin passes, the world will be descending into something very scary, and the people on the side of bitcoin will ultimately be on the better side of history
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:36:39
It's not exactly "blind faith".  The transaction can be seen in the block-chain almost instantly and 0 confirmation transactions are non-trivial to revearse.  The trouble someone would have to go through to pull off such a scam with POS, they might as well just shop-lift or run out on a tab/cab-ride..
Also, POS merchants already run this risk with counterfeit bills/bouncing checks etc..

While the second group might be right in theory, the first group (of which I'm apart) think its stupid to imagine that government would actually leave us alone and if we don't pretend to play nice from the get-go, we're running the very real risk of eventually becoming "criminals" according to the state

I wasn't talking about Shepard's piece, I was talking about the absolutely terrible piece by Kate Rogers, where nobody on the show knew anything about what they were talking about. I thought it was the most recent, but now that I've looked it up, the Shepard piece was more recent.  My bad.
(edit) Shepard's apparently done bitcoin a couple times, all of them focused on the relevant qualities of bitcoin and avoided typical ignorant media sensationalism

Mtgox has yet to be replaced by a reliable exchange USD accessible exchange. People forget that Bitstamp is just as much a mcgivered under-the-radar obscure foreign country exchange as Mtgox ever was.

dude, you're supposed to list your website when you make posts like this

I was assuming most of the early purchasers would be brick and mortar stores that already accepted bitcoin and were looking to expand their role as a bitcoin hub, which is I think how the Vancouver guys do it

I guess even the haters gotta ease up a little when they look at the scoreboard.

Actually the percentage of the world that doesn't have access to the internet is smaller than the percentage of the world that doesn't have access to bank.  Both electricity and internet costs are dropping fast.  
Over 75% of Africa has a cell-phone, where-as less than 43% have bank accounts

From California originally, but a few months ago I moved to SE Asia.  Been traveling a lot which is what gave me the idea.  I feel like bitcoin has a ton of potential with travelers.  I'm currently querying smaller travel agencies to gauge interest

The idea is that as bitcoin is adopted, the number of transactions and the price of bitcoin increase in such a way that they keep mining profitable and fees low
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:02:08
Yes it is.  We can report them to the financial fraud division of Japan I suppose
@_date: 2013-06-25 22:01:25
Coinbase should really get on this since they are the only bitcoin service that processes ach -&gt; bitcoin. In the meantime you'll have to just do it manually
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:11:41
gold is worthless too if you throw it away.. I've never heard of either of the sites you're talking about.  Why not atleast use established casinos like SD or bitzino or that minecraft casino?
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:15:20
Open up a localbitcoins account and sell them at spot, everyone is always charging 5% markups so you should be able to get rid of those bitcoins quick
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:42:47
That's not a bad thought.
 The only issue I have is the the price on the chinese exchanges was going at a full $5 under the bitstamp price, so if this was arbitrage, someone is definitely doing it wrong. (Aka, they should have sold on Mtgox/Bitstamp and bought over in China)

Ah.. you mean wizardry. I wish I weren't such a muggle
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:40:26
Pretty sure those adds are paid for.. which I guess means you can consider your losses a 'donation' to blockchain.info to support their valuable service.
Seriously though, condolences for your loss.  Try keeping your bitcoins over at inputs.io if you want to avoid temptation

Ok, You seriously need some straightening out.


You obviously haven't read shit.  The people behind this are the people who helped develop bitcoin and the bitcoin community from the very beginning. Stefan Thomas is the man behind the original "What is Bitcoin?" Video and website and numerous other bitcoin projects.  The lead developer of Ripple was the guy who initially created an ran MtGox (Before it became shitty)
Believe it or not, 'mining' is one of Bitcoin's weakest concepts.  It requires a shit ton of energy, promotes specialist miners (which decreases decentralization) and increases the amount of time needed to confirm a transaction.  
Also, the fact that the bitcoin protocol is limited to the transfer of bitcoins is another significant weakness. 
Ripple solves both of these issues and does so with a not-unremarkable degree of elegance.  Ripple (now that its open-sourced) gives us all the monetary freedom and decentralization that Bitcoin offers without cumbersome mining requirements or being dependent upon a single economic model (aka 21,000,000 units of gradually released code that a lot of people will think of as funny money).
You are WAY too focused on XRP and the way it is distributed.  I'm going share something very very important with you:  It doesn't fucking matter.  XRP serves merely as an anti-spam mechanism.  If you don't like the way Opencoin or Ripple Lab (or what-ever they are calling themselves now) choose to distribute and regulate their XRPs, you can boot-up a network with your own fucking X-milones as anti-spam units and distribute them as you please.
Personally I have 0 problems with the way XRPs are currently being distributed.  They are currently being used to incentivize users to join the network and to fund development.  Seems pretty damn reasonable to me.   If they try and pull any funny shit, I'll pull out and join a better run Ripple network. And they know this, which is partly why its so admirable that they've open-sourced their code. Because now they are held accountable for everything they do and if they start slacking off and let someone else's network become better then they will instantly start losing business.
Let me finish this rant by saying I am incredibly committed to and invested in Bitcoin.  More so than the vast majority of people in this subreddit.  If Bitcoin goes down, I pretty much lose my life savings.  That said, I'm sick and tired of the circle-jerk that this thread has become.  If you can't take a second to honestly consider a bitcoin alternative without bias, then you're just as bad as the Bankers and Regulators who are too big and important to see the crypto-currency revolution that is about to make them irrelevant.

Yea, I think the largest chapter 9 filing by a municipal entity so far was 4.8 Billion by a whole county in Alabama.  This is pretty huge

No, they couldn't, because I'd never sell my last bitcoin..

closed source ≠ scam.
I'm as big a fan of open source as the next guy.  I agree that Ripple's viability will increase exponentially when they open source their servers.  But the 'scam' terminology is not helpful and really needs to give way to a more productive lexicon.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:50:17
Yea, would tear him to shreds
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:51:01
No, it means they're afraid you're buying from a compromised bank account and the bank will take back the funds after they give you the bitcoin and they'll get screwed.
Usually emailing support when this happens will get your account whitelisted
(edit) they've also been known to give you the price you bought at anyway when this happens if you talk to them
@_date: 2013-01-30 04:08:38
I've been looking into them.  They seem fairly legit, but they are still in beta so tred softly
@_date: 2013-02-26 06:33:59
Is the link working for anyone else?
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:33:48
in the company

They are very good. If they had a bit more volume, they'd be the best. 
@_date: 2013-02-12 18:38:53
the price of bitcoin is too damn high!
@_date: 2013-01-02 00:46:52
I'm not sure it's that cheap, satoshi dice has to pay it's shareholders based on it's profits, which are pretty transparent thanks to everything being run on the blockchain. If Voorhees is really recycling the profits, then a decent chunk of that success is coming out of his pocket
@_date: 2013-07-02 18:31:41
You arrogant piece of shit.  I've been a part of the bitcoin community since 2010. I could drown your ass in Cassius coins.  You're incapacity to hold a rational discussion on top of your inane disposition to offend me has caused me to block your ass
 
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:49:18
No, it definitely wouldn't. They have limits, daily and monthly and their 1% fee would add up to nearly $10,000 on this amount
@_date: 2013-07-19 20:36:28
 actually makes it really easy to pay employees with bitcoin.  I'm sure as more businesses start accepting bitcoin, this will become more common
@_date: 2013-02-23 08:20:50
He's not naive, he's simply not jaded yet, which honestly I think is a good thing.  The bitcoin community doesn't do itself any favors by putting itself at odds with government.  There's no reason the two shouldn't peacefully cooexist.  If you're so sure government is going to come down on bitcoin, let them do it unprovoked. It'll give a us a far better chance in the eyes of the public.

I'd want it to let people book travel anywhere using any payment method.  The bitcoin travelers would pay us in bitcoin and in turn we'd pay the hotels/rentals/airlines etc.. in whatever currency they prefer.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:43:29
Dude, just email them.  I haven't seen a single coinbase user who was still upset after actually emailing support..  Why does everyone have to grab a pitch-fork as soon as the run into a hiccup?
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:54:45
You have to utilize currency exchanges like mtgox.com or find someone to buy the bitcoins from you
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:03:26
Step 10:
Pay about 15% markup
