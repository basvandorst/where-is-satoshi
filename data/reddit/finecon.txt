Bitmessage does have a chain of the last 2 days of messages, which is how you can receive messages when you are offline, but obviously this is not equal to the bitcoin blockchain which goes back to the genesis block and which relies on each previous block to continue its consensus.

The fallacy is if someone thinks the y-x amount of money isn't their money but rather the house's. If you walk in with $X and make $100, that $100 is now yours, not the house's. You can walk away with that $100. If you pull out $X and leave in $100 you are still gambling $100 of your money, not the house's.

Thats right: just awareness, how many people know that a lot of the get pink apparel sold didn't even lead to donations to research, just the spreading of "awareness?"

That's what I always wondered. From my standpoint this debate is a simple demand vs supply, where users are demanding larger block sizes to attain lower fees and miners are demanding less supply and hence lower block sizes and greater fees. Making a hard limit cap on block size is like making a cap on possible supply, maybe instead the size should be allowed to float and then miners can reject transactions if the fee isn't great enough, free market doing its job.

Buddy, you clearly have a lack understanding of economics. Yes, if the money supply increases it has been inflated, but if output increases by the same amount then price inflation doesn't occur. Furthermore, printing money does not result in an equal increase in money supply, sometimes its more and sometimes its less.


The problem is, that would likely cause hyperinflation since everyone wouldn't all of the sudden increase output by a million dollars.


Actually its one of the most predictable things in the financial world, the Fed does not like surprising people.


Inflation hasn't averaged 2% over that time period so I don't know what you're trying to prove.... 2% isn't the annual inflation rate, it's a target. Regardless, I really don't like discussing economics with people who have no interest in fully understanding it, even if they share a strong appreciation for bitcoin as I do. Happy holidays and goodbye.
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:59:47


But the value of money doesn't "suddenly" drop, it drops at a steady average of 2% a year, which allows people to use it knowing it will hold a constant non-volatile value in the short term. As for the long term, holding cash is not an effective investment.

edit: Seems like many people are missing my point, so I'd like to clarify some things. Personally, I have devoted my life to studying economics with the end goal of fighting global poverty and wealth inequality through more natural economic incentives versus say communism where it's forced (and generally fails). I have great grievances with how capitalism and banking and fiat money works, but compared to implementable alternatives, its the best option. I love bitcoin, and think it has immense power to disrupt how the economy works today and giving people opportunities they didn't have before (the leading cause of inequality and indirectly poverty), but some of the concepts of the bitcoin community exhibit great misunderstanding of basic economics and will only cause greater poverty and inequality. Yeah, holding bitcoin could theoretically leave you better off because its fixed in supply, but in the end its at the expense of growth in the economy. Using bitcoin is great, but if you own it and it sits there, its making the economy worse off. However, **THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU NEED TO SPEND IT**, simply loaning it to a friend who is starting a business, buying a miner with it (I know you're spending but in the end it produces bitcoin for you), loaning it on bitfinex, all are forms of investment that help the economy grow, give people access to output producing capital they didn't have before, and makes everyone better off.

I agree with many of your points, especially the "STUFF based society." A common misconception is that economists say consumption is necessary for the economy to be healthy, but that's not the case. Economic production is caused by consumption sure, but also by import/exports and investment (consider an economy where the gov't doesn't exist or gov't purchases are allocated to either consumption or investment), and the big thing is consumption only benefits the economy once, when money is spent, while investment continues to help the economy grow in the long term. But consumption is easier to control, so it quickly becomes the target of manipulation by economists in order to boost the economy, even if its not the best way to do so. As for your investments, over the past 49 years investments in general have appreciated very much, which is why a passive approach of index investing is commonly suggested now a days. By doing so you essentially peg your money to the growth of the economy, which has been impressive for the past century. As for bitcoin, it could be wise investment too, but obviously we can't really know for sure until after it has performed as a nice investment (isn't that just unfortunate haha) and it could also redefine the economy, but one things for sure, if people hoard their bitcoin en masse (i.e. not say us bitcoiners holding a relatively small amount or people holding but loaning it out or investing in capital markets) it won't be beneficial for society as a whole.

So if you yourself held any treasurys they would have appreciated in price due to the Fed's actions and if you sold them, you would get a piece of QE money.

Money invested into the stock market only goes to companies if the companies are selling more shares. Most of the time it goes to someone selling the stock.

First of all, you keep using appreciating and depreciating, but the central bank doesn't directly control that, and it also has no effect on the economy as a whole, inflation and deflation do.


Again, you're confusing appreciation/depreciation and inflation/deflation. If the currency goes up in value, this may actually cause people to spend more. If a currency deflates and is the generally accepted currency of the economy (or better yet the only currency in a closed economy), this is a legitimate concern. Just as people in hyperinflation scenarios spend all the money they can just to get rid of it, people in deflating economies will do the opposite, and if deflation cannot be controlled, it will likely spiral into hyperdeflation. In an open economy that mainly uses one currency but transacts with the outside world, it becomes even worse because as their economy diminishes, they can't buy goods from other economies. 


Fine, invest in inflation protected securities, it won't return that much, but at least your money it protected against inflation and it is risk free.

Many agree it's not enough because it really isn't enough. If you reread my post I argue against a cap. However, if the cap is removed and there's no way for miners to decide what they supply, then it hurts them, and that's what the current debate is about: how much to raise the cap and/or how to do so. I suggested instead of deciding what to make the cap in order to set a fixed supply, it should be allowed to float and miners allowed to pick transactions to include in mined blocks based on the fee size, allowing the free market to decide the average block size.

You have a fairly good understanding. So the Fed pumps money into the economy by purchasing Treasurys. These Treasurys are bonds issued by the US Government to bidders in an auction they hold frequently throughout the year. After their issuance they trade around on the secondary market between buyers and sellers, with no involvement or care of the US government other than where to send the hypothetical interest check to.
Bond prices move inverse to interest rates. A bond yield is simply the amount it pays out in interest divided by the price of the bond. So say I issue a bond for $1000 and I pay $100 in interest yearly, the yield is 10%. However, shortly after I issue and sell these bonds interest rates fall. Therefore, my 10% is comparatively high so people find it an attractive purchase. This pushes the price of my bond up in price, but I still pay out the same $100 annually, thus compared to the price of the bond (which has risen) the interest paid is lesser, and thus the yield is lesser.
As the Fed purchases bonds, they push up the price of the bonds which lowers the yields. After all, the government agreed to an issue price and interest amount, and although the bonds have increased in price, the interest remains the same, meaning the bonds now have a lower yield. So therefore the Fed's QE and purchasing of bonds is tied to interest rates. This is because a lot of interest rates are directly or indirectly related to Treasury interest rates, which are considered risk free.
As for inflation, inflation does have a connection to interest rates in that the nominal interest rate (the amount that is actually paid on the bond, for example a $1000 bond with $100 annual interest has a nominal interest rate of 10%) is equal to the expected inflation rate plus the real return. Thus the real return on your money is the yield or nominal interest rate minus inflation. Currently we are experiencing low or even negative inflation, which has allowed yields to remain low. If inflation rose up people would want a better return on their money.


To answer this question, no one can say that its a bubble or not, but bonds have increased in price, and it is tied to interest rates since the effective interest rate, or yield, of bonds has fallen in line with the increase in bond prices. As the Fed increases interest rates bond prices are bound to fall so that their yield adjusts accordingly to interest rate changes. In fact, Warren Buffett has said he would short the treasury market if he had an effective way to properly do so (he has too much money, him shorting the market would have crazy effects).
As for you question about money leaving the country, I'm not sure what your specifically asking. If you have any other questions or maybe could rephrase that one perhaps I could help.

He's touching a little bit on economic theory, but missing some things. The total economic profit of mining should be zero-sum, but the equation to find this is total economic profit= total income(bitcoin) - cost of electricity(labor)-cost of *renting* miner(capital). But in general, whoever is mining the bitcoin owns the miner, so they are essentially renting it to themselves. Assuming that the price of electricity remains constant in USD terms, the USD return for this miner who rents to himself should be equal to the risk free rate when adjusted for volaility in bitcoin/usd price and mining difficulty.

I think the biggest correction we will see as a result of all this newly created money entering the market will be in bond markets. If you calculate the annualized return of the stock market from 2007 to now its about 7% which is normal. We've just seen impressive returns following the subprime crisis, however these impressive returns include the stock market regaining its lost value after the crash. Therefore, I am not too concerned with what will happen to the stock market, but rather the bond market. The money introduced into the economy by the Fed was introduced by purchasing bonds on the open market, mainly Treasurys but also others such as MBS. This made the price of these securities rise, and now we see the low yields that we do. Bond yields are at an all time low, as are all interest rates. And when the Fed chooses to raise interest rates, it may shock the bond market.

You're not improving their lives, you're improving their short term purchasing power.


What is it then? Is bitcoin something to invest in or is it a currency? Currencies are not meant to be invested in, they are made to allow economic activity to seamlessly occur, since there is something with fixed or near fixed value readily available that can be transacted for everything.


Exactly, since holding cash would otherwise be an alternative, and since that alternative lowers economic activity, cash is inflated. This causes there to be investments, including risk free investments, that bring you greater value while also growing the economy. That is the point of inflation. Have cash? Three options: Hold, spend, invest. Holding does nothing for the economy, spending and investing grow the economy by even more than the amount spent or invested. Therefore, its beneficial to discourage holding, and I would agree that doing so would be unfair, *if* there were no riskless alternatives.

A lot of people think that due to rehypothecation they don't actually own shares, but this isn't the case. You own the shares, and if the brokerage goes out of business or fucks up and looses them either while lending them out or otherwise, they are insured by SIPC. Furthermore, you can buy shares direct without a broker.

First I'm going to address your second statement. Holding currency in an investment account wouldn't be a wise decision. Why let your money sit and loose purchasing power when it could be earning on itself either in the form of interest, dividends, or capital gains. Second, the government can't just come in and seize money for no reason, I don't know why you think they can.
As for your first question, sure the government and business are often in bed with each other, but regardless the government can't and doesn't just swoop in and seize assets from a 401k without reason and legal justification. It is illegal for the government to seize your assets or come in and liquidate your assets and claim the balance, and it would be delusional to think that such a think is occurring. This isn't a government pension or social security, its a private account holding private assets.
Furthermore, your original statement was that this security was limited to accredited investors so that other investors would have to keep their money in a 401k. That shows no understanding of the reasoning for requiring that unregulated securities be sold only to accredited investors or what a tax advantaged account is. First of all, unaccredited investors have plenty of options other than a 401k. Second, as long as your 401k provider were to allow it and you are an accredited investor, you could purchase any unregulated security, such as this bond, and hold it in a 401k. The government has no real interest in you keeping money in a 401k, since this defers when they collect taxes, but they allow investments in a 401k up to a limit to allow tax advantaged retirement saving.
Edit: added 3rd paragraph after reading your original statement.

I agree, its hard to foresee what the inflation rate will be, but the investments I'm talking about are pegged retroactively to the inflation rate, adjusting for changes after they occur and are measured. And yes, there are many different ways to calculate inflation since things inflate at different rate, but in this case the peg is the CPI, which makes sense because for the most part were talking about everyday consumers here. As for risk-free and investment being non mutually exclusive, it's because someone else is actually taking on risk, aka the bank, FDIC, or federal government.

Yes there are good and bad investments, but if you bundle all the publicly traded investments (available to the average joe) into one (i.e. a total market ETF), they have performed extremely well over the past 100 years, especially compared to inflation.


Yes, but if a company issues cryptosecurities you are buying them with currency, and thus not holding it. And yes by holding bitcoin, you are investing in it, and that's not what I'm arguing against. However, my reply was in response to someone who seems to wish that fiat was removed from the economy and bitcoin was the dominant currency, in which case holding bitcoin does cause the value in real goods of bitcoin to go up, but is likewise detrimental to society because its sitting dormant. So no, holding bitcoin is not harmful to society, and I hold a small amount, but if bitcoin were *THE* currency, then it would become detrimental to society.

Today regulations and the way corporations work causes a pyramid flow of wealth as you described and that's an issue. But switching to a purely bitcoin economy and spending only on what you need is still free market capitalism, just an even purer form.


I agree with this, but in addition, if I work the hardest and produce goods the most efficiently, then I can attract investors who would otherwise just be holding their bitcoin, and produce more goods at this rate of higher efficiency. Capital markets are extremely important to the economy. And with your regards to debt slavery, I agree, sometimes debt is helpful, but many times it essentially pushes you into slavery, hence capital markets are of much more significance to a better economy than debt markets.

Well the Fed doesn't buy the Treasurys from the government, so the money doesn't go to the government. First the government auctions securities to the primary dealers, the first people who buy them, then these people eventually sell them on what called the secondary market. So basically someone already loaned the money to the government but now they buy and sell these loans on the secondary market for various reasons. Think of it like bitcoin, you have the miner create the bitcoin and sell it and receive his compensation, but then it floats on the secondary market where it is bought and sold for various prices on various exchanges. By purchasing these Treasurys from the secondary market and holding them on its own balance sheet, the Fed is removing debt securities from the open market and replacing it with cash. Since they just sold their treasurys for cash, the people who sell the treasurys to the Fed will look for something else to do with the money to earn a return. If its a bank it will likely loan it out in the form of mortgages or auto loans, personal loans, credit cards, etc. If its an individual investor or fund or pension or the likes it may invest in other bonds or invest in the stock market or private equity, etc. Regardless, investors are replacing treasurys with cash and will look for somewhere to put that cash, meaning it'll eventually get invested into the economy.
As for interest rates: sometimes companies and financial institutions may tie interest rates to Treasury rates or may enter interest rate swaps involving treasury yield rates, but not always. The important thing to understand is that in the financial world Treasurys are considered to be "risk-free" and the yield on a treasury security for a given time frame is considered the risk free rate for that time frame. This may be heresy in to say that they are risk free but if you think about it from the financial world it really is risk free, the United States is arguably the most powerful country in the world and there is a low risk of default, it has yet to occur. Furthermore, the US would only default if it couldn't pay off its debt by raising more debt and since the financial world considers treasurys risk free they will always be there to buy treasurys from the government especially in times of recessionary economies, meaning the US will always be able to create more debt to pay off its old debt. Lastly, if the US did default on its debt, the whole financial industry and world would be totally fucked, so nobody in the industry even considers the possibility of Treasurys being anything but risk free. Now since there is a publicly known and available "risk free rate" it becomes easier to calculate the rate for types of debt that carry a risk of default when compared to the type of debt that has no risk. For example if I'm a home buyer with horrible credit and I want a 30 year mortgage the bank may base it off the 30 year treasury yield + 5% but if I have better credit it may be +3% if I have perfect credit than maybe +1.5%. Now think of it this way, if I'm a corporation with a AAA rated bond yielding 2% and treasuries are yielding 2%, who cares if I have an AAA rating? Investors would rather invest in the treasurys since they can get the same return, but with no risk. Therefore, they will sell the corporate bond and buy the treasury until the "spread" between the yields on the two bonds come to an equilibrium. So the treasury will appreciate in price as people buy and the yield will decrease to say 1.5% and the bond will depreciate as people sell it until its about yielding say 2.5% and the market decides a 1% spread is fair for the risk inherent in the corporate bond. So although the interest rate of the corporate bond is not tied to the treasury rate, it is still affected by it. Conversely, if treasurys are yielding 2% and a AAA corporate is yielding 10%, investors may think that the corporate bond is paying more interest than it should for its risk. Therefore they will buy the corporate bond, raising the price, and sell the treasury, lowering the price, until the yields get closer together and the spread is equal to an amount the market determines is fair.
Inflation is low right now for a couple reasons. First of all, during recessions spending decreases and prices fall which results in deflation, which is offsetting the amount of money that is being pumped into the economy. Furthermore, as we grow out of the recession the economy and GDP grows. If the money supply increases by 2% and the GDP increases 2% and money velocity stays the same, then there is no inflation or deflation, the money supply was simply increased by the Fed to match the growth in the economy. Therefore, its possible to put money into the economy without causing inflation. However, inflation may occur in the future, no one can know for sure, especially because something like QE has never been done before. However its the Fed's job to reduce inflation by doing the opposite of what it did in QE, it will sell securities and receive cash in return (its long term goal for inflation is 2% since this is enough to encourage investment without having heavy negative effects).
The Fed doesn't set interest rates for Treasurys, those are determined by the rate that bidders at the initial auction are willing to pay, however once they are traded on the secondary market the yield can change. Bonds are generally sold with a par value of $1000 and if it has say a fixed interest rate of 2% then it will pay $20 in interest yearly. This is agreed upon, the government will pay whoever holds the bond $20 in interest every year, regardless of the price of the bond. So as the Fed buys 30 year bonds on the secondary market and pushes the price up from $1000 then that $20 in interest is a lesser and lesser percentage of the price of the bond, which could be now at say $1030, meaning the bond has a lower yield, which essentially is its new interest rate.
I hope I helped to clear it up some more for you. I know the financial world is confusing, and it just gets more and more complex as you delve into it. But feel free to keep asking, since this is what I love to talk about and it bores most people, even finance students! Also, you may notice that I spelt the plural of Treasury as Treasurys and I know this isn't proper english but for some reason in finance its spelt that way about half the time.

It does push people a little bit extra to invest, but the main reason is to encourage consumption. The problem is many people in this community pretend as if that's the only option, either hold a currency that is inflating or spend it, when that's not the case. The Fed doesn't inflate the currency by 2% to penalize those who don't consume, its to penalize those who hoard currency and don't contribute to the economy. Investing is a viable option that allows you to put your money to work in the economy while not being subjected to inflation. And when people act like this means the Fed is pushing people to take risky investments, they are forgetting the numerous risk free investments available to them, many of which beat inflation over the long term and some of which are pegged to the inflation rate.

First of all solar is extremely far from replacing fossil fuels, EXTREMELY far. As for the law of accelerating returns, comparative laws such as Moore's law have been disproved as law for the indefinite future, even by its creator. Also, how does food get printed? Please explain that to me.
As for the economic side of things, a basic economics course will show you that deflation is harmful for the economy. As deflation occurs people are encouraged to produce more to earn more money that will increase in value, increasing aggregate supply. Simultaneously, aggregate demand will drop as people wish to save money rather than spend it since in the future it will have more purchasing power. This just further accelerates deflation and economic activity is brought to a halt. Everything does not get cheaper, I don't know how you surmised that since there is centuries of data showing quite the opposite. Furthermore the purpose of inflating the money supply is not just to raise prices but rather to increase the money supply on par with an increase in economic output. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 00:07:44
The problem is that for the same reason people will be motivated to work hard to obtain money that will increase in value/deflate, people will also not want to spend money since the longer they hold it the more purchasing power it has. The result is aggregate supply increases and aggregate demand decreases, further pushing down price levels i.e. causing more deflation. Suddenly you have hyperdeflation.

People don't always go for the cheapest option. Your also forgetting the prices of services.

The economy doesn't experience decreases in production costs that technology does and furthermore you're missing the point of inflating the money supply. The purpose is to match the growth in the economy.

Right, this has no relation to cryptography being banned. Read the post by He says we don't ban, but mentions the issue cryptography faces with relation to quantum computation, which you falsely refuted. Of course quantum computers would not ban cryptography, even if every form of cryptography was breakable, that does not mean its banned, it just means its breakable.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:48:19
Yes, you're missing the point. The reply to that comment from which this thread started says they don't ban it in response to the first comment, but then adds that by creating a quantum computer they could easily circumvent many forms of encryption, meaning they don't need to ban it to make it an ineffective security option for many uses. You responded to him by saying that cryptography is left unaffected by quantum computation, and I pointed out that public key encryption, the diffie-hellman exchange, and various other implementations of cryptography would be very well affected.

Explain to me how PGP, bitcoin, bitmessage, and a diffie hellman exchange would all work as they do now in a post quantum computer world. The answer is they would not, all the features that these implementations exhibit have not been mapped to quantum proof algorithms, its a simple fact. Thanks for wasting my time talking about something you clearly have no knowledge of, I don't see the need for us to drag this conversation on any further, so if you want to do your own research the article I linked is a decent introduction and you can read further on the topics mentioned on your own if you'd like.

It has the potential to chance the price of bitcoin significantly in the short term, and it describes a situation which would be impossible if trading were done on a blockchain. Two reasons right there that show how this headline and bitcoin are quite intertwined.
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:47:14
It is true, straight from wikipedia :
 "The problem with the currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently large quantum computer running Shor's algorithm."

No they do not. Try reading the whole article in detail, there is much research going into post quantum cryptography approaches, but many have not yet successfully been implemented. At this point it is still open a state of open conjecture for many of these approaches, and they haven't been proven or applied successfully. Sure active solutions such as proper symmetric encryption and Kerberos exist, but those do not work for everything we depend on cryptography for.

To be fair, taxes are originally how drugs were made illegal, since the federal government doesn't have the power to outright ban substances (hence an amendment for prohibition). They required a tax for the substance, but you couldn't buy it with the tax already paid and you must present the substance before paying the tax, so if you bought the substance and went to pay the tax and claim your stamp, you clearly had the substance for a period of time *without having paid the tax*, a crime. Once the US signed UN treaties making certain substances illegal however, this was no longer necessary since Congress has the power to create legislature to follow treaties the US has signed even if the power to create such legislature is not outlined in the Constitution or amendments.

I said bitcoin was *superior* to gold. And also, rates weren't raised until December, so that doesn't explain 11/12 months in the year. Furthermore, what I'm saying is that gold is becoming outdated and isn't used as a store of value in times of crisis as much as it was in the past. Treasury bonds and gold have traditionally served that purpose, but I think in the future it will be more of Treasury bonds and bitcoin versus gold.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:57:59
You sound a little delusional. The Fed cannot buy stocks. And companies buying back stocks is the complete opposite of borderline fraudulent. What could be borderline fraudulent is the dilution of shares through option issuances. And yeah, expect another round of QE, but until then monetary policy will begin to tighten up. The whole reason for this is to minimize deviations from the moving mean, no QE would have resulted in a much larger recession than what we experienced.

From what I understand after a short read, the bitcoin is held in a multisig wallet and returned as you pay off the loan. So you deposit $125,000 in bitcoin as collateral, get $100,000 cash and pay that back with interest, and then get your bitcoin back. If bitcoin doubles in price you get $250,000 back, your still exposed to market movements in your bitcoin holdings.

Even if regulated exchanges do close, there will still be unregulated exchanges which I think are still dominating the market compared to regulated exchanges. Combine that with the fact that bitsquare spreads are oddly small compared to their lack of liquidity and the lack of instant exchanges and you're not gunna have a lot of market makers interested in providing liquidity.

Well gold isn't a currency, and it's also asinine to hold a currency for a long period of time. Individual equities may occasionally crash, but the whole stock market has yet to even come close to that. In the great depression the DJIA only lost about half of its value, then regained it all and then some in under a decade. Its pretty clear equities are the way to go for long term store of wealth, the numbers do not lie. I'd rather have my wealth decrease by 50% then regain everything in under a decade than have to hold a metal that loses value for several decades before regaining value, even if it means I need to take a look at my investment account once a year or so.

No, but unfortunately greatgrandpa's investment wouldn't have faired too well either. From the period during the great depression until about 1970, gold actually was on a steady decline in value when accounting for inflation, and then after 1970 it went from under 500 an ounce to almost 2000 an ounce around 1980, then down to under 500 again, then back up to over 1000. It seems gold really doesn't do a good job of preserving buying power unless you cherry pick the right time frame. Really, the only way to maintain your buying power is to properly manage your buying power and not hold it in one basket.

@_date: 2016-12-21 03:05:56
No, I was aware actually. And that is not what I asked, since legal tender does not mean you can use it to make a purchase, only to pay off a debt with no payback type restriction. So while you can pay your state taxes in certain states with gold, any store can and likely will refuse to accept it, just as they can refuse cash which is also legal tender (for example, many stores refuse bills over $50, even though it is legal tender). So again, when is the last time you ever saw someone spend gold to make a retail purchase or can you cite any retail chain that accepts gold as a form of payment?

The standard fees for hedge funds are 2% of assets under management and 20% of total annual returns. Hedge funds don't aim to beat the market by cutting down on expense ratios, they charge high fees in return for either very high returns or market neutral and otherwise hedged returns.

Yes, and people purchase them to store value...


That simply isn't true, both of those are examples of what people use to store purchasing power, and historically they are some of the best examples.

Ok, and the problem still exists that there is no liquidity. Bitsquare is to just buy/sell BTC P2P? Great! Oh wait, nevermind, the only sell offer up right now for USD is for 0.3 bitcoin. How am I supposed to use bitsquare as a platform to buy btc p2p if I can only buy 0.3 bitcoin and then the order book is exhausted? I'm not arguing that bitsquare should be for trading, I think it should be for p2p buy/sell, but in that department it is failing.

Regardless of the fact, Bitmain no longer has a monopoly due to asicboost. It is generally more profitable to mine bitcoin than bitcoin cash (I know this isn't always the case), and giving up use of asicboost to mine bitcoin is more profitable while reducing the centralization threat. So far the bitcoin community as a whole has decided segwit is beneficial. NYA players haven't fully enabled it and may never in order to create the illusion of a problem, but they have been losing in that department.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:16:06
AFAIK they can mine blocks that contain no SegWit transactions, so they are losing out on a bit of fees by doing that, just like they are when they mine empty blocks. As SegWit adoption continues to increase and the block reward continues to decrease this means even more of a gap they are suffering. So again, SegWit integration through a soft fork has essentially reduced the threat caused by asicboost and will continue to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:36:47
Isn't asicboost useless on bitcoin now? IIRC they needed a hardfork to use asicboost with segwit, which is one of the reasons they supported a hardfork. Bitcoin cash is minable with asicboost and segwit2x would've been too, but bitcoin is not.

Ok, but you can simply not update your phone. It seems the FBI wants this version of the OS so they can put it on a phone they already have physical access to, but since this version *does not exist* they cannot do that. They are asking apple to make it for them, i.e. it does not exist.

your response:


@_date: 2016-02-17 22:51:45
It's not the data that they are making vulnerable, its the restriction on how quickly you can enter the passcode. The encrypted data has no implicit vulnerability, it is completely secure up to the level of security determined by the passcode. Unfortunately the passcode is likely only a simple 4 or 6 digit code, so it would be relatively easy to brute force, however apple has designed the phone so that there is a delay between code entries. The FBI is asking them not to build a backdoor in the traditional software sense, but rather to modify the OS so that the delay no longer exists, and they can quickly enter passcodes to quickly brute force the phone. So it's not even a backdoor the FBI wants, they want to brute force the phone, they are just asking apple to make it easier for them. Apple has responded by saying they have never made software that would allow you to enter codes without delay, hence such a solution for the FBI *does not exist* at this point in time.

That is how it works in the US banking system. The US has reserve requirements. BoE applies to GB which only has capital requirements.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:09:59
That is not correct, deposits are being lent out, and a small amount of these deposits are held by the bank as reserves for people who want to withdraw their money. Banks cannot just lend out money out of thin air, they have reserve requirements and restrictions on asset and liability ratios.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:31:25
Bitcoin in mined at a predictable rate yes, but again I could do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin. Use the same system that US banking uses. Accept 10 bitcoin in deposits, lend out 9 and hold 1 as a reserve. There are now 19 bitcoins. Sure only 10 truly exist, but there can now be 19 bitcoins held as deposits if the 9 loaned out are deposited, and this can continue to increase if the cycle is repeated.
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:46:26
Yup, it's lending money with interest, and the money being lent is deposits, a fraction of which are held as reserves instead of being lent out. It's fractional reserve banking.

@_date: 2017-10-05 21:43:04
I only study US banking regulations, and they do have reserve requirements. Furthermore, capital requirements also restrict banks from creating unlimited amounts of money, and are argued by some to be more effective than reserve requirements even if enacted alone. Furthermore, the way "new money" is created is not the same as when a central bank injects money into supply, in fact you could create "new bitcoin" in the same manner by using fractional reserve banking.

YOU ARE SO WRONG! Please look into what you're arguing before you argue it!


NO! MBSs are not derivatives. Not. Do you understand what not means? If you happen to know anybody that refers to them as derivatives, you should imform them they are wrong, because they are not derivatives. Its as simple as that. They are securitized loans. They do not derive their value from an underlying security because they are the security. And therefore, they are also not leveraged, the underlying is not leveraged.


As I said before, the Treasury did not take over Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, they were placed under the conservatorship of the Treasury, meaning that the Treasury was effectively the board and CEO. The Treasury however did not buy out either company, and therefore does not own either company, both of which are publicly listed stocks (tickers are FNMA and FMCC), which are owned by private investors, not the government. The government doesn't own these mortgages! Furthermore, neither does Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (which aren't banks by the way), they simply securitize them and sell them to private investors.


Proof? Can you actually say anything that is partially factual or does everything just come out as a pile of bullshit?

One of the main reasons to hold fiat versus income producing assets is due to the fact that they have extremely low price volatility, which bitcoin does not. Bitcoin has quite some time to mature and stabilize before institutions that aren't simply speculating on its price begin to hold it.

Please do some research before you continue to hold your stance.  Lehman Brothers collapse was not due to leveraged derivatives, in fact they held little derivatives that were equivalent to long MBS esposure, that was AIGs department. Lehman's fault was that they owned subprime MBS, or otherwise sold them and accounted them as sold even though they were contractually obliged to buy them back in the future, while leveraging the value of the entire firm with bonds and bank loans.  For example, say I raise 10 million in debt, buy 20 million in unleveraged vanilla MBS, then these MBS fall in value to below the 10 million in debt, this would result in a bankruptcy and is exactly what happened Lehman.
As for Fannie and Freddie, this link you shared only points out that they were placed under the conservatorship of the US Government. FNMA and FHLMC are a complicated situation since they are and have always been government sponsored entities, but in this situation they remained publicly traded but all financial decisions were controlled by the US Treasury (note this isn't the FED, whom you claimed took over both of these GSEs originally).

You're jumping to some false conclusions. Fracking is not the cause of the drop in energy prices. In fact many fracking companies are struggling to remain solvent now because of the drop in prices. Fracking is actually a cost ineffective way of obtaining oil compared to conventional methods such as drilling.


The TV may have dropped in price, but it has now also become a near essential part of American lifestyle, hence Americans spend more on a product that is becoming cheaper, leading to an indeterminate effect. You also overlook a large number of commonly bought items that have exceeded the rate of inflation, for example: healthcare, housing, and education.

They don't hold fiat, they hold bonds denominated in fiat, which pay interest (well not always with the whole negative rate fiasco). For central banks to hold bitcoin, I'd expect to see government bonds denominated in bitcoin for the banks to buy, which I'm not certain will happen.

I'm pretty sure with SecondMarket OTC trades the pricing is usually slightly above market to account for the slippage that would occur if the buyer tried to buy them all on the market. Of course this benefits the seller since they would also theoretically experience slippage at their loss, but its always been the case at SecondMarket for them to trade slightly above market price IIRC. I would imagine these auctions would have similar pricing effects.

I actually find that last sentence interesting that "lack of inflation is caused by little of the money going to the middle class." That very well may be what's allowing a large increase in money supply without inflation if money is not ending up in consumer markets.

I'm not going to argue against banks putting money into overnight swaps versus lending to consumers, even if its not spurring direct economic activity its a way for the bank to earn a low risk profit while also decreasing the chance that other banks will face a run. These types of transactions are 100% necessary in order for our banking system to work.


Sure returns on CDs are low, but so are returns on any risk free investment. There are plenty of alternatives to the stockmarket however (bonds, P2P, private placements). Also 401k =/= investing in the stock market. In fact, you can purchase CDs in a 401k. I also wouldn't call what occurring an obvious bubble. We've seen the stock market produce insane returns for the past few years because it has been recouping the lost value in 08, I think once it gets back on to track with where it would've been if the crash didn't happen it will return to the mean annual return.


Blatantly false. Theoretically if some QE money went to joe we could see inflation but theoretically we could also experience deflation or no change. Think about how leveraged the world was before the crisis. Suddenly everyone deleverages and the money supply shrinks = deflation and recession. The FED attempts to correct this by pumping up the money supply, the result=inflation from the state of the economy RIGHT AFTER DELEVERAGING (ie deflation then inflation) Therefore, the end result is unclear and that's what I'm trying to study.


The FED, the FDIC, and the federal government set guidelines for the amount of risk a bank can take on. Obviously there is therefore a clusterfuck of regulation, but each body has an interest in keeping bank risk at a proper level. The FDIC needs to insure deposits without taking on too much risk itself, the FED wants to keep the economy growing at a steady pace by balancing risk, and the federal government theoretically seeks to do the same but obviously can have ulterior motives.


I did somewhat leave Joe in the gutter, because its blatantly too risky to offer unsecured loans en-masse to the general public. I agree thing have to change and the word is spreading. Just look at startups like commonbond and SoFi. These startups will allow private investors to invest in student loans, hopefully pushing down student loan interest rates and making the financing of education much cheaper.

Yes for all debts, but buying something at the store isn't a debt, it's an instant transaction. A example of applying the legal tender for all debts concept is how you can go to the bank that issues your credit card and pay off your bill using cash.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:33:42
Well I mean you seem to have some misconceptions. First of all banks can put money into CDs, they issue CDs. Also with your comment on the stock market, you say other investments are no longer available, but what investments are no longer available that once were? Furthermore, there are plenty of investments that vary from the stock market, at least from what I can see. Retail investors can easily enter the bond market, P2P loans, participate in forex speculation, invest in private businesses, and even invest in student loans and the like.


What do you mean by this? Banks do often "lend to joe" through home mortgages and credit cards, but by offering unsecured loans or lines of credit or funding student debt they are taking on extra risk, albeit with a higher return. This issue however is that A) banks don't want to take on extra risk since they are still wary after the crisis and B) banks are limited to the amount of risk they can hold on their balance sheet, hence the rush to treasurys and home mortgages that have less risk.


Student loan rates =/= Federal funds rate. Student loans are generally long term loans that carry credit risk compared to the federal funds rate which is for overnight lending to solvent banks, comparatively risk free. The current student loan rate is down to about 4.5% IIRC, so it has adjusted similarly to the federal funds rate.
The intended effect of lowering the interest rate is to spur investment by searching for better yielding investments, and as such is appears investors have flocked to the stock market. I find it interesting that more has not been channelled to private student loans and the like, but you and I play a role in that just as much as anyone else.
@_date: 2015-11-01 22:47:29
I feel like you actually have no idea what you're talking about. A decrease in mortgage signing rates would have no effect on mortgage derivative prices. Derivatives could decrease in value because they derive their value from the value of a mortgage backed security, which would slightly fall in value as rates are increases in order to enhance its yield. And this decrease in value would be no where near 30%. Take for example the Vanguard Mortgage Backed Securities ETF, the average duration of the MBS this fund holds is about 4 years, meaning the fund would only loose 4% of value if rates rose 1%. Rates would have to increase by 7.5% in order to warrant a 30% drop in MBS value and thus a 30% drop in derivatives.


Fannie Mae is the Federal National Mortgage Association and Freddie Mac is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, both of which are government sponsored enterprises which has been the case since their creation by the federal government. The government didn't take them over. Even if the government did take them over, which they can't because they are already GSEs, it wouldn't be the liability of the FED, since the FED isn't a government entity. Furthermore it wouldn't be a liability for the government either, but rather an asset.
