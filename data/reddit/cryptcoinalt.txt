Can I then send the monies to a normal bank? If I wanted to? Or transfer to pay a mortgage bill etc?

How do you get BTC into GBP £ fiat? 
Any other options other than coinbase who only send in EUROs?

Can you then send the euros or gbp to a main bank etc?

You dont get your fee's/ loss refunded if you are shown to be lax with your security anyway so who the hell is the LP specialist  - also all the UK banks do not offer 2FA where as almost all exchanges and hardware wallets do so there is an extra layer.

Depends who the bank was  - MBNA has stopped me buying at Coinbase- They are dictating where i can spend my money!!  I can burn 10k on a holiday but not at coinbase! NOW this is why the WORLD NEEDS CRYPTO  - big banks dictating you can invest here or there but you can pay us interest, let FIAT depreciate in our banks whilst we pay you.01% but f'k me don't go buying an asset class/currency/investment we don't like... SWIVEL banks.. I will be slowly taking all my money out over the next 12 months  - no debt, no mortgage and sit in   and  or even use $LEND (as  would say "Gonna be ' BIG')

Robert you are full of it! who paid you in the government.
A woman took out loans to buy BTC and she sent it oversea's!!  Did anyone ever use fraudulent credit cards, FIAT etc . Did the Mafia, gangs use BTC or was it FIAT!! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:24:47
i'd say yes as well but don't invest in it unless you can afford to lose it..  or you can buy a car or book a holiday and lose it anyway
