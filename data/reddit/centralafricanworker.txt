f/2.2 is pretty wide for an aperture.  Nearly 100% of real professional lenses (medium format) are f/2.8 or slower.

Typically when you short something, you borrow it from someone then sell it. Selling it will put downward pressure on the price.
Selling futures contracts naked could also drive spot market prices down
@_date: 2014-09-01 16:28:29
I'm talking about the real pros who use medium format.  AFAIK there are only 2 lenses faster than f/2.2. Contax and Mamiya 80mm primes.  And sensor size doesn't matter to exposure, it only changes the fov.

My buddy has a 4 car garage with 12 20 amp breakers (So he can weld in any bay, including an air conditioned paint booth).  My rigs are strewn accross my house because I have 15 amp breakers. My two-card rigs take 6 amps each, so max two per circuit.  I have 5 rigs, 10 cards total.  I have to pay my friend for the electricity to run his AC and the rigs, plus 100% on top of the electricity.  It works out for me, as my wife hates all the noise and heat.

If it's a dedicated miner, you should consider 5970's.  They are $550 vs. the 6990 at $700, and are more power efficient.  There are only 6 left in stock at my local computer stores.  I have thought of going to get them but I already have 9 of them.

I bought a watercooled 5970 for $420 used.  It paid for itself after it found its 2nd block in about 2 1/2 weeks.  That was before the last difficulty increase which was 50%, and the next one will be above 70%.
@_date: 2011-05-16 17:31:08
Difficulty just jumped 50%, and is about to jump another 70% or so if block discovery stays above 9/hr.

no he unlocked it to a 6990.  The new 6xxx series cards can be bios unlocked to higher numbers.  He must have discovered a new bios hack that lets you go from a 5850 to a 6990.  ATI has been holding back on us.  They had all the technology for the 6990 in the 5850 at the time of release.  It's a process called binning.

That is $5300 in GPUs alone.  I'm guessing you are going to have to spend another $1000 for the rest of the machines.  How long do you think it will take for the equipment to pay for itself? Have you taken into account rising difficulty?

*Edit this is not true.  Its an error in the calculation used to figure the total has rate.  It uses the difficulty and block discovery rate.  422 Ghash/s is calculated using the old difficulty and the new discovery rate.

when you ship this I would recommend removing the graphics cards, as UPS/USPS/FEDEX can be pretty rough.
I had a computer shipped to me once, and the cpu heatsink had broken off and was rolling around the bottom of the case.  It was an aftermarket heatsink and was pretty heavy, but not as heavy as a 6990.

The way pooled mining works is that the Pool Server tells your computer the difficulty is 1 or 2, depends on the server.  Every time your computer solves a very easy block, it sends it to the pool server.  These are the shares.  The pool then reviews the blocks and sometimes one is below the current target and that is an actual block.

having your CPU run at 100% utilization 24/7 could shorten the life of the CPU.  Make sure you have adequate cooling on your CPU, and I wouldn't try it if it was a laptop.  Most laptops cooling cannot handle 100% load for long without overheating.

In the South, there is definitely a Robin Hood mentality among jurors.  They will always take money from the wealthy and give it to the poor, even when it's their own damn fault.
Two examples:
Patient tells doctor that they have no medicine allergies; doctor prescribes antibiotics; patient develops rash due to allergy; sues doctor for $850k and wins.
Mother gives power of attorney to son; takes POA to bank and cleans out account; mother sues bank; bank must reinstate $150k that was legally taken by the son with the POA.
Jurors want to give money to those that have none from those they see as having enough to afford it.

originally had plans for a third 5970 (6x GPUs) but did not have enough time to learn linux.
Also I actually had this hooked up to a 1000W silverstone PSU that it was hooked up to when it was air cooled.  When I cranked up the overclock past 900 Mhz on the cores, the PSU would trip.  It was probably due to the extra load on the 12v by the two pumps (added reliabily, I picked up 7 on eBay for $100, results in insane flow though) and fans.

Travelling for two weeks for work in Arkansas.  Nice change of scenery from my usual travels to Chad.  I wanted to work on two of my rigs while here in Arkansas so I brought them with me.  Running 3x 5970s, if I add a 4th, the extension cable (rated for 15 amps) gets warm.
I just found out that one of my 5970s that I thought was fried, ran at 101°C for about a day (was still hashing when I shut down the computer), but wouldn't post after that, is actually fully functional as a secondary adapter.  I was about to RMA the card.
For clarification: When I checked on my computer the gpus were 99°C and 101°C. The pump on my watercooling loop failed.  The water in my block and the nearby tubing had boiled off.  Phoenix was still hashing away though. I closed the windows, shutdown the computer, replaced the pump and tested the lines/bled the air out, and the computer would not post. Replaced the 5970 and the computer worked fine.  I just tested the card again, but as a secondary adapter and it works fine, back hashing at 830Mhash/s with 1000mhz core/347mhz memory clocks.

If that is true it is better to just buy the coins today and hold them.  Much less hassle, and more profit.  Purchasing coins is a better way to speculate on their value.
Right now you can buy more coins with your money than your hardware would ever generate.  Difficulty is only going to go higher and higher. my rigs have generated over 90% of the coins they will ever mine, and I only started mining about 2 1/2 months ago.  There has been more than 10x increase in difficulty since I started.

100 BTC is about $1700.  Assuming you can build a rig for $1/Mhash, you will get 1.7Ghash/s.  Right now that will get a little over 1 BTC per day.  With the increases in difficulty every 10 days of 20% or so, the 1.7 Ghash/s may never make 100 BTC.  This is ignoring electricity costs, which are now significant.
@_date: 2011-05-25 20:16:43
It wouldn't have to be inflationary, just a steady 6 blocks per hour with 50 BTC per block; no decrease in block size. As long as the demand for BTC or the goods and services in the BTC market grew at the same rate, there would be no inflation or deflation.
I would think hoarding would be worse in the deflationary model, hence used less.

Yes, there is.  On short rounds you are penalized more for having less computational power.  People with large amounts of hashing have a greater chance of avoiding stale shares.  Short rounds favor more computational power in pools.  On long rounds there is no difference.
