I don't understand how people are confused by this. The story broke today, it's not old news. The events happened in the past, but the information came out today. 
Take a hypothetical: if a company fraudulently reports millions of dollars in nonexistent sales a month ago, and the market is unaware of that until today, it's not old news. It is breaking news about events that occurred in the past. This is simple.

Because people don't understand how markets process information. It's not old news if no one knew about it. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:20:55
Where was it previously reported? It's not old news if it's the first time the story has been reported. That's not how markets work.

The government doesn't have to set specific prices for the US dollar to have value! Prices may change, but the fact that a dollar has value is unrelated to those prices. The government doesn't say "x will cost ___ dollars' but it does say "pay x taxes in dollars." It also says "fund our government with x dollars and we will pay you x + interest in y years." 
As far as I can tell, bitcoin has no value OTHER than investor belief. The only way it would have intrinsic value is for it to replace ACTUAL currency as a means of exchange--and I am asking you to describe a scenario in which this is the case. But you are unsurprisingly deflecting. 
It is not a strawman. You compared value of belief in bitcoin to belief in the US dollar, and I countered with reasons why the US dollar has value other than investor belief.

In your scenario where the US dollar collapses and bitcoin is somehow the dominant currency (rather than the renminbi, or the Euro, or some other combination of state backed currency), what do you expect the geopolitical state of the world to look like? I would really like a well-reasoned answer to this question. You're clearly imagining some degree of stability and security, if a digital currency which requires massive energy and telecom infrastructure is still functional. How did we get from our current state to this new state?

Coke might not be a necessity, it is subject to government regulation (although well established and understood) and it certainly has many competitors, but it also is tied to an operating business with relatively predictable cash flows which allow investors to actually value the price of the stock. Can't say the same about cryptocurrencies.

My last word is that Zimbabwe =/= the US dollar. This is actually an argument IN FAVOR of what I am saying about the importance of geopolitical state power. Zimbabwe can experience hyperinflation because it is a non-important fringe state with poor financial management and no significance to the world economy. 
A deflationary asset is useless as a means of exchange. Why would you ever spend money if it will be worth more tomorrow? 
Just because bitcoin represents a concept that people believe in ideologically does not mean it has any value. Countless other coins can accomplish the same function as bitcoin and there is little barrier to entry. 
There will have to be huge societal changes for any other currency to replace the US dollar (let alone a decentralized digital currency). Things don't happen in a vacuum.

But the market was already pricing it in even though no one knew about it! /s

But that overly simplistic comparison ignores the fact that the US dollar is backed by the US government. There is a clear financial, economic, and military structure in place that gives the dollar its value outside of pure investor belief. Bitcoin has belief and....what else? Some technological merit, sure. But unlike an operating business, there is no clear path to actually monetizing that technological innovation other than THROUGH investor belief.

Imagine investing and not knowing what "Fed" stands for. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:51:41
Okay, let's say they aren't predictable. They are still cash flows! 
If you use stupid meme language like "FUD" to describe investment you are asking not to be taken seriously.

Backed by the government means that you can pay your taxes in US dollars, it means that the government issues its own debt in US dollars (in the form of the most stable asset class in the world, the US treasury), and it means that the dollar is the reserve currency for the entire world financial system. These are real factors. What do you even mean when you say "If the government started mandating what everything's value was in dollars, we would have communism." The government already does that; try paying your taxes in anything else. What is the extent of your education in terms of monetary economics? I recommend doing some reading before you get too lost into ideology. 
Again, if you are imagining a future in which the US dollar has collapsed and non-state currency reigns supreme, you need to describe the conditions of this society. Why does the energy and internet infrastructure underlying digital currency still exist? What are the 300 million+ people living in the former United States of America doing now that their government is no longer around?

I will do that, as there is a clear economic benefit to me doing so (in the form of money invested and also in the form of tax exemption). 
If you can really imagine a scenario in which crypto coins have replaced the US dollar (or the renminbi, or the Euro) and the world isn't also ravaged by massive war and/or economic and societal collapse, I would LOVE to hear your reasoning. How would this crypto society come about? What institutions remain? Who is maintaining the infrastructure of the internet? Why are your coins worth anything?
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:44:52
Not only that the system will collapse, but that it will do so in a way that preserves the necessary telecom and energy production infrastructure that enables digital crypto currency to exist. Which to me seems far more unlikely than a collapse alone.

So refreshing.
