Mind sharing the name of that video game? I'd like to try my hand.

Great work, guys.

That wasn't necessary, @_date: 2017-12-17 02:59:37
Sir, I apologize. The post was written when I was high from being tired.

You know what, the dot com bubble sounds like alts and shitcoins to me. 'ICOs'

Not saying it's not parabolic. It may be, or may not. We may be too early a position in the charts to say but it is consistent with adoption. 
Business adoption or user adoption makes no difference. The users of the world dictate what is used in our time now, do you think businesses would accept bitcoin if their customers demanded it so?
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:33:18
Incorrect assumption. Adoption is causing the rise. One would argue that speculation is not adoption but the actual fact is BTC is being bought because of it.
Come for the potential profits, stay for the vision and tech .

How about lobbying CoinMarketCap for a switch to mBTC?

I can salute that. OP reached his moon indeed. One small step for OP, a giant leap for Hodlers.

Wow why Malaysian Ringgit?

Christ you gotta watch it and give justice to that one ball that was eaten. It could've been the right one.. could've...

Why the hate, people? Let him do what he want. He and the Libra Association (big money) can do whatever the hell they want.
Bear in mind, Libra is exchange tradeable, which would make it easier for people to get onboard to Bitcoin and the other alts. And would also make it easier for people to exit Bitcoin and move back into fiat.
So much win there, why the hate?

In Asia we have forced tips in the form of a 10% Service Charge (or any percentage) - there's no need to tip. 
That was a culture shock to me too when I found out US waiter / waitresses get great tips at times. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:48:17
Referring to the tipping or the service charge sorry? 
Yeah our part of Asia (SEA) usually have service chatge

Someone get some wet tissues please.

Thanks MrD3, truquini, I too was about to do the same.. and then Ripple tanked. I'd also like to add that I also believe in BTC long and wanted to grow my coins.
Greed is a dangerous weapon indeed. I'm sorry for your losses and glad that you seem to have as very positive outlook in general! Keep it up sir and keep hodling.
Note: I'm an insanely lucky trader that have never lost a trade in 5 years that I've been trading. I owe it to blind luck and a preference to hodl. Your post made me feel comfortable as I have been worrying I'm hodling and missing out on the alternative bubble. I'm glad I'm hodling after all now.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:00:09
So glad to see I'm not the only one seeing that. Their loss our gain.

Does using Blockchain info wallet means we sort of control our keys?
