At the very end:
"It's too bad there's no money in this, isn't it?"

Buy a book and learn it from the inside out. You'll have infinite job options regardless of price.

This is a complicated question. You'll enjoy and understand cryptocurrencies better if you pay attention to progress in the developer community instead of Mr. Market.

Sent some btc with a small fee forced by multibit a couple of days ago. It confirmed in ~72 hours

Spectacular. Bitcoin's biggest problem right now is that even highly intelligent people don't quite understand it. Many ideas that are "common knowledge" would be in the same boat if they weren't drilled into our head since birth. One can only hope bitcoin's core principles become less intimidating to the general population.

"Real". With current monetary policy in the US, deflation is as theoretical as the cause of gravity

In Paul Krugman's utopia, there is no room for bitcoin to exist with even the relatively small amount of relevance it's gained thus far. He's praying it will fizzle out, and trying to justify why it will / should. He does have a very static view of the world, with a terrible sight for innovation.

The number one problem with Krugman is his static view of the world. To believe in a centralized government / banking system, you have to believe that the world today is the same as tomorrow. 100 years ago you took a ship to cross continents. Economic theory needs to keep pace with technological advances. They guy just says what die hard liberals want to hear.

Give it time. The infancy of bitcoin and the current policy's enforced will find their way into a stand up routine if / when crypto currency makes it big.
