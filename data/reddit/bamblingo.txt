my address is 1zVf1xZeGrDgTZn9uk2uhEoXKrjPugH21  (~.2743 BTC)
i am sure it is correct because when i decipher my public code into coinbin the same exact address shows up as the one above.
i bought the coins and they already made it to the LBC account. the public address i used to go from LBC to coinb.in is

you made me retrace my steps and i found the issue. 
one missing letter in the private code......
but again thank you

already did that.
they told me since they recieved them they couldnt help and told me to contact coinb.in instead and they have no phone number but i emailed them

this is the TXid for this transaction
i just simply wanted to send them into the address earlier so then i could use a market but now it appears they are stuck and untouchable?
the loss of AB is really screwing me over made everything so simple

and yes sorry didnt see the second part

no the address is for my wallet, while the number given to me was the public code for my wallet.
i thought the transfer would happen automatically but i think i may have jsut figured it out.
and dont worry i didnt take offense to anything and seriously i appreciate the help

also using coinb.in shows that the address is linked so it has to be connected...

coinbin can decode public keys and turn them in the standard address. that is how i know the address is right.
connected just means i thought the coins would be "connected" back to my coiinbin once they cleared through the block chain
