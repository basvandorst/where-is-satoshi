Jessie from Xapo Support here! In order to fund your Xapo account, the funds will need to come from an account in your name. If you don't have the payment option that you chose, you can email buy and ask us to cancel your buy order so you can choose a different payment method!

I'd rather eliminate the need for nasty letters ;)

Jessie from Xapo Support here! So sorry to hear that you're having this issue. Do you mind please PMing me with your registered email address so we can check your case ASAP? Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:12:45
Nope we're not! Jessie from Xapo Customer Support here - is there something in particular that you can be helped with? Send a message to support and I'll respond :)
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:20:31
Don't worry! We don't actually require a linked Facebook account to order the debit card. This was a tool used for our early beta testers. Although we have now closed beta testing, we will reopen the full debit card program soon and linking a Facebook account will not be necessary in order to receive it :)

Hi Francisco,
Sincerest apologies that this has been your experience with Xapo! I cannot seem to find anyone in our system by the name of Francisco Dominguez that has had any sort of compliance issue. Either way, that is an extraordinary long time to wait, so can you please DM me with your registered email address so I can make sure you get taken care of right away? Thank you!
@_date: 2017-04-11 00:08:26
UPDATE: user's account has been fully verified! Also, I understand and sincerely apologize for your frustration that it took our compliance team 3 weeks to be able to fully check your documents! All is okay now, though and thank you for your patience!

Hi John,
Jessie from Xapo Customer Support, here! Just an FYI, we were making an update on our site and for a brief period of time, there was an interface issue. Nothing happened to anyone's coins or accounts, it was just that they were not being displayed properly! Everything is okay and has most definitely been fixed by now, so go ahead and login to your Xapo account and you'll see that everything is in order now :)

Hi Jonathan,
Xapo Support would be happy to help you! (We suggest always sending an email to support first so that we can handle your case there.) If you could please send an email to us (from your registered Xapo email address) so that we can solve this issue for you, that'd be great :)
@_date: 2015-11-18 15:39:51
Jessie from Xapo here! Just wanted to clear a couple of things up:
1. Your funds were not stolen!
2. Your bitcoin will always be yours.
3. Xapo tries to help its users with the beloved "anonymity" factor of bitcoin. The following FAQ will answer that perfectly for you :) 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:01:50
Hi there! I can see that someone from our team has already responded to you and we're trying to work with you to resolve the issue already :)

Jessie from Xapo here! This is something that is being handled personally with Edward. No coins were lost and Xapo, itself, was not hacked! The post was deleted due to the fact that this is a personal matter that is being handled directly with Edward. Thanks everyone!

Hi there,
Jessie from Xapo Customer Support here! May I ask if you have reached out to us about this yet? Emailing support is always a good way to go about this!
Regarding your account, may I ask if you have an ad-block or anti-virus on your browser? It seems as if something is blocking you on your end! We received a similar case today in which when the other user disabled this newly installed ad-block, they were immediately able to log back in. Do you mind please checking this out and letting me know? Thanks! (P.S. although it seems to be that something within your device is blocking the site, you can also send me private message with your registered email address so that I can take a look at your account!)

Hi there,
Jessie from Xapo here! Sorry that this has been your experience. With the amount of phone hackings and portings, as well as how easily it can be done now, Xapo needs to (and always will for the sake of your money) err on the side of caution. That being said, we're sorry that this caused some friction for you! Can you please DM me with your registered email address so I can make sure that someone from our team contacts you to resolve this?
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-30 16:01:37
Amazing! Glad your Xapo card is treating you well, especially while traveling! :)

Hi there!
Jessie from Xapo here. It seems that we have a display issue where it stays at (0) processing and isn't making the proper change to (1), (2), etc. We'll be fixing that in the future, but yes, it will always go by the blockchain's confirmations so once a transaction has reached 6 confirmations, Xapo will automatically recognize that and it will change from (0) processing to complete. Thanks for your patience as we work on this fix!
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:58:50
Hi there,
Jessie from Xapo here! Please note that Xapo does not control how quickly transactions are confirmed on the blockchain. When a payment is initiated from Xapo, the funds are immediately sent and Xapo makes sure to cover a big enough miner's fee so that it goes out and gets confirmed as quickly as possible. Transactions into Xapo are completely out of our control, and please always remember that you can check the transaction on the blockchain in order to see how many confirmations it has! Simply paste the address on the blockchain that it was sent to/from and match it up with the exact funds sent, date, time etc. and you'll be able to see what the holdup is! 
Also, for all inquiries such as this, it would be much easier for you to just contact support so that you can be helped directly and don't need to wait for when/if we see a Reddit post - thanks! 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:33:20
Yes, if anyone emails that email address, it will come to me directly and I can expedite your case!
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:39:51
Thank you for posting this warning!
Jessie from Xapo Customer Support here. I would like to officially confirm that the email is in fact a scam and is NOT at all related to Xapo! If anyone sees this email, please do NOT open the attachment! 
Thank you &amp; safe bitcoining!
