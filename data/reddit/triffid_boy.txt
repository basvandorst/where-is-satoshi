I'd agree if the bitcoin Blockchain/processing could be used for something other than transactions. 
I think it's missing a real trick by not using that computational power for something useful, or sellable, as far as I understand the mining algorithm is just difficult for difficulty's sake.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:11:53
A typical interest rate is between 0.5 and 2% no? So you would get between 50 and 200 per year in the bank?

Neither and both. 
If you were looking back through human evolution it would be difficult at every offshoot species to say which one was going to become human, it's the same when looking at the evolution of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:18:19
Me too! Want to push my holding up to 0.1 bitcoin! 
Hold my beer. 
I think there will be a correction, there has been plenty in the past. But this looks a little different and the correction could be from 10k down to 6k, best to hedge bets and buy small amounts consistently!

Bitcoins are infinitely divisible. Any number of people could use it.

Haha I admire your balls but I think you mistyped your address. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:33:31


No it doesn't. You could know 200 people, of which 100 use bitcoin, and 100 people don't. That would make you 1 in 2.

I'd be willing to take a chunk of that too! I was just pointing out that mbrochh's way of justifying the point of view was invalid.

I'm aware a lot needs to change, and there's plenty of time and opportunity to allow it to change.


I don't disagree with you that my knowledge is lacking, I'm only recently taking more than a passing interest in bitcoin.  
That said, this is a shit argument and instantly identifies you as someone I'm not interested in the opinion of, just saying you know something that I don't without even stating it (let alone providing a source) is hilarious - it's actually for this reason that I dropped as a source of info. Maybe isn't much better for factual information, but at least it's fun and well spirited. 


Well this is only currently true, my understanding is that a consensus to increase the divisibility would solve this problem.

I agree that we need to be rid of nuclear in the long run. Renewables were not suitable 40+ years ago when nuclear was ready &amp; beyond safe. More investment in nuclear could have lead to the use of reactors that don't produce waste. 
There are even coal power stations that have the potential to release zero carbon.
But these are both technologies that we should have been on instead of traditional coal/gas, over the last 20 years. We can, probably should, skip nuclear altogether and go renewable and battery. 
Not really convinced a reduction in population would help, most of the really populous regions use significantly less power-per-person. It's mostly us westerners using a shittone of power - but this is something we can supply with renewables.

@_date: 2017-08-14 16:30:56


All those disasters included, Nuclear is still by far the safest and has resulted in the fewest deaths compared to fossil fuel. Which, until now, was the only alternative. 


Yes there would be, since western countries are the biggest contributors to these issues - and have the lowest populations. 
I agree populations need to be reduced, I just don't think it will solve any of these issues.

@_date: 2017-08-13 19:05:48
Better than coal. Although I agree that we should be on other renewables by now. Nuclear should already be the thing we're on, moving towards renewables. Anything to get that carbon down.

so... don't sell and crystallize your losses. You can't have invested more than you can afford to lose, and you're an idiot if you thought it was going to be an overnight investment. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:44:17
haha, I had hoped to get across that it was an emotional, rather than factual *feeling*. As in, once I feel like it's dropped enough to justify buying more, I'll buy more. I'm not worried if it's the real trough or still massively higher than the real trough - because it's within the amount I'm happy to lose - and I'm in for the long run.

Bought a little as it starts to dip, will buy more when i feel the bottom of the trough. Still sticking a couple nights out worth of cash though - I'm going to be out of a job for four months next year so need a little bit of security.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:08:30
yep, it comes with its own risk. But if you want to minimize the risk of losing money you have essentially already spent (e.g. just ordered that tesla) then a stop loss means that at worst, you lose out on gains beyond what you need, rather than a market crash meaning you're in the hole for a new tesla. 
The flip side is it was a flash crash and thus there was no reason to sell, as the market recovered - so you lose out on the gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:03

@_date: 2017-09-12 15:34:31
Yes, and with an update each bitcoin could be infinitely divisible. 
So imagine a world where the entire economy is based on 1bitcoin. 
Imagine people trawling through tips because of the possibility of finding old hard drives with bitcoin on. 
And then imagine that same world after someone finds 100bitcoins on an ancient hard drive.

@_date: 2017-05-27 08:45:00
So, I'm a noob with btc. I bought at about £1700, but only an amount I wouldnt find traumatic losing on a night out. Around £150, I had a fun week but as of this morning I've "lost" a fair chunk of money. Ain't selling, don't need the 100 quid back. 
I think part of the problem is that people in desperation buy btc and hope to get out of their troubles. The national lottery in the UK results in long queues in the poorest parts of the UK every Saturday, the richer areas might play, but they don't hang their hopes on it.

Up until your 30s the best thing to invest in is yourself. Get a strong education and as much experience as possible so that you're more adaptable. If you've got cash, use it as a safety net so you can study the stuff you're most passionate about.
