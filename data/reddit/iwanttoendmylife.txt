what if I job this summer?
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:38:25
Yes I play from blockchain directly to SD
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:48:56
I know :/ I really do try...
I can 3-6x my profit from it but then itjust fuckes me over! i think it is rigged or something to be honest.... when i went in for my 91% was off by 6 from 6000 so unfair
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:04:11
I'll try, I am already in -6.44 in overdraft fee from my bank from a coinbaes transaction for .1 btc (WHICH I OF COURSE LOST)
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:51:09
that is the system that made me lose btw
when i use that system though and consistently keep getting losses i usually get furious, then go all in and then BAM!
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:42:17
this made me feel better, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:29:15
Yeah but I was planning on making it back on my own and paying it back from my own...
wouldn't it be better that way to not involve them and get rid of the debt myself?
probably not going to work out at the path i am goign down right now :(
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:06:31
wont go to a doctor who just takes a money and gives me harmful medications
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:36:52
Shut the fuck up dude if you have nothing positive to say get the fuck out of this post then. 
I know it is all my fault I just want someone to relate to. It isn't a fucking joke post. You dont know my fucking life.I have been depressed everyday and you dont know what you're talking about. I may sound crazy but you can go fuck yourself you fucking cunt.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:37:47
Yeah I am contemplating that. for some reason though I still can't get this feeling of gambling out of my head that i can win more! I feel like I hae the worst fucking luck ever imaginable :(. I win a shitload, like 4x or 9x my profit, then it goes all gone!
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:02:15
I am probably going to find a summer job to pay that off.... but I was plannig to go to so many festivals this summer but now it is IMPOSSIBLE now! I could have bought electric forest ticket and all this awesome stuff but due to my stupid gambling habit i have nothing!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:09:19
thanks for the horrible advice!
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:05:02
ya the stress and anxiey felt from losign all the money is dinfitely affecting my studies n shit :///
i have seemed to gain a growing feeling of apathy towards everything
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:47:08
I am not enjoying my life at all. I have zero life here at college
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:07:34
thanks :/
I got a 2.49 GPA last semester, hoping for a 3.2 or higher this semester
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:45:50
What illness though? An addictive personality? 
You don't know how fucking self-hatred I feel to myself right now. Even though I lost a shitload of bitcoins a few weeks/days ago I was glad I made 100 from 26 today. But then I lost it all, off by fucking 6 FUCKING NUMBERS I THINK GOD FUCKING HATES ME. Then in my other wallet with .5 BTC i gamble it away and lose it right away because of anger. I dont know what to do. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:49:37
I feel like whenever I get money I go straight to CVS and deposit moeny and gamble the 50/50 bet right away... its fucking pathetic.
i went there like 5 times in the past week or two it is fucking embarrassing
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:34:10
i am majoring in chemistry currently at university of illinois @ champaign.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:53:48
No, I have not talked to them about that weed paraphernelia debt. its fucking retarded didnt even have weed was just a vaporizer in my college dorm. They odnt know about that. They would be pissed.
See, they'll be pissed about the gambling and that. I dont want to break their hearts anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:32:00
Yes probably. It just feels like im growing more apathetic and self-destructive everyday.
i have even considered going down that road you have described. I have tried oxycontin, I have tried heroin, and those were the only things that made me feel okay.
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:04:45
yea i mean people probably have more losses than me like over 10k or something but I still feel like fucking shit. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:31:06
thanks :/
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:44:11
Sigh its just that if i never gambled in the first place I would have like over doubled or tripled my profits :(
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:51:28
yes... but this is probably the biggest mistake ive made in my life.... and the self-hatred is terrible. als btw i barely have any friends at all that i can consider true friends
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:31:33
great to hear :P
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:48:28
Would it be wise to tell my parents about this? They would be very dissapointed in me but i dont know who else to turn to :(... Dont really want to talk to a Gamblers anonymous thing 
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:32:55
Is that young man you? Good story.. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:43:11
I have lost 500-600 dollars since my Spring break, not including BTC inflation.
When I found out about satoshidice, that is when it went downhill.
 I have made many trips to CVS just to go straight to gamble and lose it. I donated blood, made 30, turned it to 100, lost it all. 
Made 1.4---&gt;9.5 BTC through somehow, not kidding.... only to lose it all the next day. I wanted more, and more.
I have also turned .1 BTC--&gt;2 BTC and lost it all
I then got angry and bet .5 in my other acc and lost that
These are just examples, I have lost much more. 
then i kept chasing my losses. even pawned things that I owned lol.
u can look at my thread if u want, it is definitely not a good route to go to. don't chase your losses. 
if I had invested in BTC instead of gambling I would have over tripled my profits.  I would have over 1000$ worth of Bitcoin
I started gambling when they were about 50-60 each.
Wish I had never started. I would be a much happier person. 
I have gambled away $100 my dad gave me this weekend and it makes me sad :'(
In the long run you can never win. Someone showed me this 
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:33:35
I want to buy btc becuase i know it is a good investment however satoshidice is right there in the fucking blockchain sidebar that it is so tempting to not play....
i wish there is a way to ban myself from that website.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:44:27
I am not really into doing that stuff
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:03:44
Was never into gambling, but since satoshidice is like right on the sidebar of blockchain, it made it tempting. I was never a gambler at all before I got into bitcoin. 
not saying bitcoin is because of this, but I feel like it makes it more accessible at least for me.
not sure how to really explain this....
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:07:24
I come from a good family. They are good people.
But I know they would be very dissapointed in my decisions i have been making lately.
i have even considered buying heroin because I am so fucking depressed with my life. Gambling is a fucking pathetic way to live and I regret ever finding satoshidice.com 
another story was I pawned my gpen (oil vape) to my friend and then went to CVS and made a 50 percent bet lost right away in less than 20 minutes. 
I feel like shit. However, I don't want my parents to worry about me even though I am in a terrible situation right now....
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:53:12
oh hai, im 18 btw
Edit: :p slowly recovering
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:17:53
Good decision, when I went all in when I had 9.5 BTC on a bet the number I got was like 63,000 something. lmao. the site fucks you over.
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:52:35
yea i feel ya, its just that voice in the  back of my head where im like i can win. i went all in (30 dollar sworth from my plasma donation today) and turned it into 120 somehow. then i lost it all on a 91% bet that if you get a number less than 60,000 you win. Numbers are from 0-600000 going all in losing only 6006  :/ Sign from above that I am not worthy of shit, it rly does i gotta findhelp somehow
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:29:30
Ya I am an asshole aren't I? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:59:22
my parents are very well off in my opinion, however I don't want them to know that I have been gmablng.
i did tell them that i lost 100 dollars off SD (they dont know what that is) but then i continued to gamble the money they gave me for school and shit i feel terrible i cant even afford school supplies anymore :( 
I really do feel suicidal though, I would end my life in a heartbeat right now if it wasn't for the people that care about me and I know they would be hearbroken
