Speculative means, the chart is jumping up and down sharply and in a wide range, as compared to most other assets, which makes it unpredictable even for the same day. Whereas saving money has turned out to be ok for most people in most situations, it's agreed there were bad exceptions in history. However, how crypto would behave and be treated in such situations, is not known yet, so it's just an assumption that it could save somebody.

You hit the point. Also the number of channels to be opened can only stay reasonable when a central hub (a bank?) would open the channels to its customers, routing the payments. Try to calculate the number of channels required if everybody has to be connected to everybody, it's obviously going to insane numbers by exponential growth. By design, LN must end up in a centralized network, when adoption will exceed the play around stage.

Well you're just presuming that you can successfully hide your crypto, so that nobody knows about it. This might be true in some cases today, when you are careful enough, but I'm quite sure that governments will find a way to always know about what you have. As soon as they know, they can just force you to pay any fines or other debts in dollars and send you to prison if you don't pay.

Don't know whether "whales" are actively manipulating the market, but for sure many professional players in these markets have the ability to be some minutes ahead of the average guy when they see that any news will have impact on a rather small asset like crypto. So they will buy or sell before the news are public.
Regulation might not catch this volatility. It is inherently caused by the deflationary appearance of crypto coins. Nobody would "hodl" dollars because they would expect them to rise in value i. e. in its buying power. It's also not a wrong behavior of the "hodlers", this is just the effect if you create something which appears like a deflationary asset. If you like gambling, go for it. It can go to the moon or to zero, nobody knows. 
But an asset like this won't be a currency for common daily use, you need something much more stable for that. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:49:38
There were times when you could get interest rates for your savings above the inflation rate. And you got this interest rate for your interest too, which made you a small fortune over decades. This is actually the weird situation, in the most basic economy lessons, they tell you that interest is the price of money, meaning that the lender would earn this interest from the borrower. Which makes a lot of other economical math logical. The zero interest rate neglects this logic, with several strange side effects. I hope the US will continue to change that again and other big economies will follow soon. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:04:24
I know, but you need an open channel for everybody who you want to deal with. My calculation of 4 channels anyway only holds with centralized hubs, or do you want to get controlled by only one single hub processing all your financial transactions? With no central hubs, everybody would require 20 to 50 channels, and to open and close another 10 to 100 during one month.
In my above example, if only every 400th channel gets closed daily, the bitcoin network is full already.
And I am talking about the math for 100 million people. "Worldwide" would mean several billion, maybe 3 or 4 billion people who would have to do any kind of financial transaction. Plus all the companies and authorities, can't tell you the number of them right away.
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:29:01
As a buyer, you rarely have to deal with credit card fees. The seller will have the cost invisibly in the product price, but in many cases the price is just the same for everybody, which makes the credit card the most convenient payment method (not talking about PayPal which is even more convenient).

I don't think they will all fail. Deutsche Mark didn't fail for 50 years until it was replaced by the EUR, which is doing well until now for 20 more years. USD didn't fail either, basically it exists for more than 200 years. They only had to change its underlying paradigms several times. And until now, they always created a substitute for any failed currency. In this global world, I hope that neither USD nor EUR will ever fail, I fear it would actually cause war. Remember Lehman Brothers? It was only one single bank, and the worldwide impact was huge already. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:50:25
The bitcoin network can process maybe 10 or 15 transactions per second, whereas Visa alone actually process more than 1,500 transactions per second, so they process at least 100 times more than the bitcoin network theoretically could accomplish. 
LN would require myriads of nodes, channels and bitcoins in these channels to work on a large scale. Centralized hubs are indispensable but not visible yet. Even if only 30 percent of the US population try to live with only 4 channels to central hubs open, you need around 400 million channels with some satoshis in it. Every closing of a channel hits the network above. 
So maybe you can answer your question yourself now. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:21:28
I wasn't missing this point, so I only counted 1948/9 until 2001. But yes, the Mark had to be replaced several times between WWI and WWII. The gold standard ended already 1914, after that, the trouble started. However I suppose it was more due to the (lost) wars and the worldwide economic depression phases than due to the fiat alone.
@_date: 2018-09-11 07:25:09
Still to prove that this works, at the moment it doesn't. And the hubs will get more and more similar to banks, a network as you describe it requires some hierarchical organization on the technical part already. How about the trillions to put into the open channels, I see this is why moon and lambo and why we need sub satoshis, but do you actually believe that? So let's see when or if this will gain enough momentum to grow at a rate which deals with the above figures showing the real scale.
Answer to OP is simple, completely impossible today and tomorrow.

It's not that I actually disagree, I only want to point out that when someone would live his life like an ordinary worker although he has lots of money, he will just die rich and his heirs will happily spend. Of course spending money must not be exaggerated, but hoarding is also an exaggeration. So your person A is exaggerating the spending, he could live in a nice but cheaper house, still spend money for other things, and invest for the future, whereas person B is exaggerating the hoarding, living a very poor life for the benefit of others.

@_date: 2018-09-09 12:25:21
Main argument against deflationary currencies is that people don't use it in daily life but rather hold it, so a government would have to enforce its usage. Still people would try to avoid the usage by bartering or by using another currency. It's a variation of Gresham's law, you can see the actual effect by just looking at bitcoin. It's so obvious when people don't actively deny to see the proof. 
"Inflationary" currencies only work when the inflation rate is managed to be steady and low, like 2 percent per year. The stability is much more important but the small inflation rate keeps the idea of rising wages and rising prices running without too much impact on the real world. Comparing - or better mixing up - such a well-managed currency to a failed currency in hyperinflation is ridiculous kid's BS. 
There is no final word about it because it is a debate about the fundamental philosophy of your economy in the end, as you said yourself.
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:08:31
Basically I was ok it with and I made it to the end �� Only the part about LN looks a bit oversimplified, given the clear facts and substance you provided in most other parts. And you should consider that crypto has to compete with other highly speculative assets in the portfolio of investors. They will not put the whole the risk oriented part of it into crypto only, would look even more professional if you share some thoughts about that. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:47:02

The actual theft is that they put the interest rate to zero. There were times when you could regularly put some money onto your savings account, and you got interest above the inflation rate. Then you got interest for the interest, and after a decade this could be a small or big fortune already.

Well they just don't like unconfirmed brand-new email addresses, guess why.
Some years ago, I regularly sold my used items to other private people, over the years it was more than hundred items for sure. There was NO issue with PayPal in that time. Maybe 10 cases with issues between myself and the buyer, and in maybe five cases PayPal to stand up as the escrow to resolve the dispute. They are not saints, it's true that they immediately block the funds of a disputed case, and they reserve the right to decide the dispute. I agree however that PayPal have accumulated much too much power in the meanwhile.
I'm coming back to PayPal very often in the crypto discussions, because they are a storybook example of a real game-changer in the worl of payment: So they actually are what crypto want to be. There were lots of online payment services at that time, but PayPal were the ones to INTRODUCE TRUST in the online retail business, their escrow offering attracted everybody and made them to what they are now. Starting back in 1998, they do 200 transactions per second today.

Yes I guess bitcoin is going to be replaced by something else somewhere in the future, but this better thing is still to come. As your example showed already, it's often not the pioneers which make it in the end. Tether would have been close to this better thing, if it would be a decentralized thing and if at least they would have performed a crystal clear, transparent and independent audit which would have been generally accepted, but now the trust of big economic players is gone forever, I suppose. Bitcoin suffers from a lot of issues which unfortunately are not accepted as issues by the community, especially the strict deflationary approach which is one essential reason for the exaggerated hoarding and gambling, thus causing high volatility, thus hindering mass adoption in daily life, and there are even more issues...

No intrinsic value though, which means you need some other guy to buy it from you at a price you can accept, and you need the network up and running which means you need miners. You hope that no bad guys will show up and threaten your or your family's life in order to get the keys. You hope that government will not forbid crypto usage (believe me they will detect it if they want to). So for long-term and big investments, a lot of hopes.
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:21:21
This is the one point which is very questionable. I fully agree that inflation is also a good means to keep the spiral of rising wages and prices almost flat. But we all know that things which we make spinning faster and faster will break down in the future. Our wealth is built on the exploitation of the 3rd world countries. For instance our throwaway attitude towards Smartphones is built on the shoulders of the Foxconn workers, which are 60 hours per week slaves, taking their breaks in cages called rooms for 6 people with paperboard mattresses. Don't get me wrong, crypto isn't the savior even when the kids want to believe that. But probably, if a currency like USD or even EUR would break down, we will have a bloody war all over the world, billions of people might die from violence or hunger. Economics as we know it rely on the "more and more" and I don't know a good solution how to bring the fast spinning circle to a soft halt. So yes I believe that something must be changed because we can see the national debt issues and how smaller countries are at risk. I don't think that most people here can imagine what actually will happen when USD fails, they actually dream of the world just changing to bitcoin overnight and then go to Starbucks the next day on their way to work while looking into their smartphone to buy the latest fashion lol. Maybe it's better them kids believe that, like they believe in the Easter bunny.

Directly after WWII, Germans had the issue that the old money was worthless and new money was not yet there. 
People were bartering to get the most urgent things, of course the people were very poor and looking for food and clothing. Soon the "cigarette currency" was born, the Americans provided cigarettes but they were really scarce, the intrinsic value was guaranteed by the smokers who craved for them to actually smoke them. All others used them for bartering against a somehow agreed standard value - which is the most basic function of a currency. This kind of currency worked for almost two years until the Deutsche Mark was introduced. I think this is a good real historic example how currencies work. 
However this was the recovery already. If only one big currency fails, the following worldwide economic crisis will ruin lots of people, there will be hunger and death on the streets. I'm afraid wars would follow soon, for the one or another reason. Can you remember what happened with Lehman Brothers? It was ONE SINGLE bank which failed, no currency affected at all. And it already ruined many people and caused a big economic crisis all over the world. Now imagine the USD or EUR would fail, you wouldn't want to see the outcome.

Boosted economy would be fine with me, but looking at it more long-term and globally will reveal the issues. The Western world is selling everything including their knowhow into China because that's the only way to still sell more and more (growth is always expected in this economy style). However soon, China will be a saturated market too, and maybe you can repeat it once again in Africa. After that, where to sell all the new goods?
Interesting thought from your side about money supply, you might be right, even after a currency failure, states can just invent the next one and print more again.

@_date: 2018-09-02 22:39:50
You hit the point, that's why mass adoption won't come with bitcoin. Deflationary currencies can't be used for daily life. Even when forced upon a people (and you would have to force them with centralized power, lol) they would still find a way to not spend it, for instance going back to bartering, or using a foreign currency secretly. And many keep telling you the price might be stable later, but how should we come from here (community toy) to there (mass adoption) if the community itself is preaching the hodl doctrine. Of course it's the right way to hold it as long as you believe it's dollar value can still get higher, but that's exactly why it's not a currency, but a speculative asset. 
So never stop using your own brain, as you did it already.

My apologies for keeping you busy with the guessing.
Originally, I was not thinking about a crypto guy but about Elon Musk, who actually is one of those visionaries who can change the world. However, it seems he is at the edge of failure, because reality doesn't always follow his dreams.
If you were rather thinking about crypto people, look at Jihan Wu. He recognized the business opportunities and made literally billions (of dollars) by mining, operating the biggest mining pools and inventing and selling mining rigs. In only about 5 years! But again, it seems that his success might not be sustainable. I could imagine that he always was aware that he is just riding a wave, and is currently looking for a smooth exit (he is not yet successful especially with the smoothness).
So what these visionaries obviously do, they can see how to do things differently and can make them happen in the real world. And they see business opportunities faster than others and go for it.
But you can also see that big ideas may be followed by big failures. Let's see how it goes for both of them. I agree with you that nobody needs idols, but it is good to look at the successes and failures of others to learn from it.

What I meant with the tech was, that segwit is still lacking adoption and I have understood it would be needed for LN. And LN itself, I'm afraid, would only work well with centralized exchange nodes, because this would lower the required number of open channels significantly.
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:46:22
It was just one common theory to explain the sharp drop, that it would be based on the GS news. At least we can see that it's all based on psychology and emotions, when someone shouts "GS is out" the market drops, two days later someone else says "it was fake news" the market.. no didn't come back, but simply did nothing, and then dropped again sharply a day or two later.. Another idea is that the GS wasn't the primary reason, but something else like the silk road wallet, or anything which didn't even become public. 
It's a lottery where the big players get to know the winning numbers with a small but sufficient head start.

The author clearly states that the ecosystem built by this new Bakkt company will be completely different from the roots of BTC, it will be fully centralized, built on trust and mostly off-chain. The question to be answered will be, whether and why the blockchain would replace all existing background infrastructure, given the fact that everything else would just be a copy of today's banking system.
But I could well imagine that this would have the potential to rise the USD value of BTC, because Bakkt would have to absorb a considerable amount of BTC in the first place to set up a safe operating mode (see OKex as the counter-example).

For LN, you would require centralized hubs, this is basic IT knowledge IMO. Look at how the Internet especially www is organized. 
For the escrow position which is essential for retail business and which cannot entirely be performed by programs, you need an acknowledged third party which factually is a centralized agent.
For risk management, you will require big companies which don't look as bad as OKex last week when something happens.
For the urgently required regulations, the companies will have to invest a lot (reserves, custody, scalability,... ) which will force consolidation and you will end up with a handful of big players.
At the end, this would pretty much look like today's banking system, all original ideas of crypto abandoned. 
But if it's all the same in the end, crypto is not needed because there's already a mature banking system. So the long-term outlook isn't good. Today, I don't see the game-changing effect which would be required. 
Just don't believe the crypto ecosystem can survive when the first world industry and finance system fails, people will be literally fighting for food, and plants wasting electricity (if any available) for crypto mining will be burnt down by the people who need heating, working fridges and who require light to earn their living, also at night time. Stable electricity supply? Stable Internet? Online access for everybody?

I would have expected such countermeasures earlier by single countries, tbh.. If more countries do the same, it would be a threat for Bitcoin too. I suppose China doesn't act against it because they see how much money their miners and exchanges earn, and good business is  super appreciated in China.

Bitcoin is backed by nothing except the belief of the community. Please overcome the fallacy that something has value because there was effort to create it. (How much time would I need to draw a colorful big picture, and what do you think would be its market price?) 
Since a bitcoin has no other purpose than being a bitcoin, there's no natural demand. On top of that, it requires the network to be up, running, and accessible.
So if you want to bet on it long-term, here you go. But it's a dangerous bet.

The world is a big monopoly game already, the game was invented by watching reality..
Capitalism lets everybody start with business, but after a certain time with lots of players, a tough consolidation phase will separate the wheat from the chaff. With more money, luck and/or good decisions, some players get ahead of the others and rise in an upwards spiral, while they suck down the others. Unlike the monopoly game, usually a small group of players stay, an oligarchy. After some time, somebody has a game-changing idea and can catch up with the oligarchs, other ideas are revolutionary, killing the old markets and creating new ones. Still the smart old oligarchs have a headstart with all their money. 
We will see this happen again soon with the thousands of coins in the market. Bitcoin has a good chance to stay. Ether and Tether are the runners-up, but still all of them can fail.
You can already see that crypto can't change the world order. Although we see new billionaires catching up on the old ones, using their opportunity and being lucky, it's still the same game. Again, it's an oligarchy, few people make the big money while many people pay for it. So you're right about that. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:28:15
It's true that it's difficult to use bitcoin as a currency while others use it for speculation, since the price is volatile and the deflationary appearance makes everybody think how much they actually pay for their goods if the price would rise and rise.
But there's no rule what to use bitcoin for, so the market develops its own behavior. May change in the future, nobody knows.

I would say it's rather the transaction volume which doesn't reflect what's going on. It seems that bigger players often send around coins among all their addresses, for whatever reason. And I don't think that for instance Huobi could constantly have a 24h volume 20 times higher than Bitmex.

At least everybody who has "more" should own two addresses, one with all the Bitcoins and the other address to be filled from the first one with the amount for "daily use". So you have 10 BTC, send 0.2 BTC to the second address and use the second address to pay. Of course this can be traced back, but most people won't do, all the time. 
Looking at this, it's actually a major privacy issue for BTC which might be a problem for wider adoption.

Deposit currency outnumbers actual cash about 5:1 in the Euro zone, should be comparable for the dollar.

A bit naive what you're saying in your post. For most people, you can at least tell which level of society they belong to, only looking at their outfit, their house and their car. What about all the famous people living in Beverly Hills or Monaco? The most expensive places to live in a region are usually well-known, and it's also known to whom the properties there belong. The rich people themselves are also famous and listed in the Forbes magazine regularly. So not so many secrets at the top. 
Regardless whether you have all your fortune as Bitcoins or dollars, would you want to live like a beggar? You would rather spend a reasonable amount of your money for a good living, so it would be visible that you're rich. Of course you can do some understatement regarding your financial power, and make less of it visible to the public, but most people wouldn't want to exaggerate this. Your heirs will be incredibly thankful when you live your whole life like a beggar, only to leave them millions. Be sure that they will eventually show it to the world then.

And looking at a currency to be a means of exchange for daily use, you need stability. Sorry I can't see how BTC can get there, it's a chicken and egg problem with wide adoption and reasonable stability, that's the target but there is no road to this point.

Bitcoin is a new religion, that's why there's so much hatred especially against people who split from the sect, and there is a lot of dogma talk "HODL" and promises for the life after "to the moon and lambo".

Maybe you're a genius like Da Vinci who already sketched helicopter models around 1500, but nobody could build them without the needed materials which were not invented yet. So maybe you woke up decades too early like Chris Pratt in The Passengers.
I'm afraid the next future is less shiny than you dream of it, and I hope your landing after the flight won't be too hard. Basically we need visionary dreams.. but some might be too visionary still.
What everybody should be aware of, if they're expecting a total failure of the current economic world, don't believe that this will happen peacefully. History has no examples that major changes of the world order would happen without major wars, with whole peoples killed or displaced, and nobody knows today how the surviving parts of the world would look like when this is over. I'm quite sure that any survivors will find their gold easier again than Bitcoins, if at all. 
So to state that crypto will just take over while big existing currencies fail, is a bit naive at least. Don't care about Bolivars or Liras, they don't count on a global scale. But imagine the USD or EUR crashing in this way - hell will break loose. Remember Lehman Brothers? It was only ONE SINGLE bank.

The absolute price in USD wouldn't matter if it would only be so stable that you can use it in daily life. No prob to either spend 1 BTC or 0.01 Satoshi for a coffee if you can rely on it and calculate with it for a while. 
However due to the limit of less than 21 million BTC, the value of one BTC would have to be incredibly high. Only cash plus sight deposits worldwide exceed 22 trillion USD, to replace only this so-called money supply M1, one BTC must exceed 1 million USD. Don't say this is going to happen or even possible, it would just be the math.

There's a lot of wrong thoughts about the usual currencies being "inflationary". Basically the banks try to reach stability, however the 2 percent inflation rate should help to keep up spending, it's not the big issue. The real sin was to go to the zero interest rates, which are against a stable logic of economy. There were times when a private guy could save money for an interest rate of 3 or 4 percent, overcompensating the inflation rate. With interest on interests, you could make 2000 bucks on top on interests within 10 years by saving only 100 per month. At zero risk! And for me it's also clear that borrowing money has to cost money (positive interest rate), this was the original business of stable and honest banks. So I am convinced that the people blaming the small inflation rate instead of the zero interest rate are barking at the wrong tree. It's good to see that the Fed, finally, is trying to get away again from the sick zero rate. 
And many people overlook that all banks do a lot of intervention at the markets every day to keep the currencies stable. Short-term stability of a currency is super important for day-to-day life, imagine that retail business is working on profit margins of 0.5 to 2 percent. So without intervention, currencies would jump up and down a bit more, and the mass psychology programmed into the trading computers would amplify these effects to make any currency look like today's crypto markets (not that strong of course, but for a major currency like USD or EUR, jumping 10 cents every day would be an economic nightmare already). 
Sorry for the long-winded foreword but it is important to see this first. Then finally, it's also important to look at the deflationary behavior of bitcoin. In a variation of Gresham's law, the deflationary currency will be held and not used in daily life, because you feel that you pay too much when using it. We see this with all the long-term "hodlers" just keeping it forever, waiting for the moon. I can see no way how people could be motivated to use a strongly deflationary currency in daily life, I guess they would rather go back to bartering or invent a substitute currency which is inflationary (see the principles of Gresham's law again). So the limited supply will be the really big issue: Instability could possibly be cured by mass adoption, but the deflationary approach will be even intensified by further adoption and will make the daily use more unlikely. So bitcoin's destiny by design is to be an asset for speculation. 
TL;DR It is not the small inflation rate but the illogical zero interest rate which puts economy at risk. Currencies are kept stable on short terms by intervention of the banks which is very important for economy. The deflationary design of bitcoin makes it a speculative asset rather than a currency, won't get better with further adoption, unfortunately.

This is not completely correct, for any producer the cost is only their expenses, not the full selling price which is known in the market. So they have them as an asset in their books whose actual price is not known yet (depends on the market price at the time of selling in the future).

If this is not feasible, it's not building up trust, to say it politely. Last resort should be the issuers themselves who should happily refund the dollars, even in billions, to make crystal clear that their scheme works on a large scale too. So if they don't do it...

Even when I'm from Germany and have read the news about it, it's not completely clear and partly pending.
This Berlin court declared that you need no banking license to deal crypto, which means for instance, everybody can open and run an exchange, as far as I understand.
But this included, or was even based on, the statement of the court that crypto is not at all money, a currency, or similar to it.
The court in Berlin is a state court of the country of Berlin but not on the level of a federal court. The authority which was blamed by this court to act beyond their competence, the BaFin, is the federal authority responsible for all banking and payment stuff in Germany. It seems they won't accept the rant, but will forward the case to another court on the level of the EU.
For me, it's not really clear what it actually means for crypto in general. Best thing to happen would be a clarifying and binding statement from this European court, for the whole European Union.

I'm still very interested, but my conclusion is that bitcoin cannot make it in the end. Especially the missing stability, the deflationary approach, the missing scalability on chain and the decentralizion issues when using other layers will make mass adoption impossible, at least with the current decentralized and unregulated ideas. The huge power usage for mining, the pool concentration in China and the wildwest exchanges are contributing to the failure. Still, market manipulation is a thing, the latest issue was the temporary USDT crash, and there is more to come.
At the moment, the chart looks like a wave running out, since December. Every high is followed by a lower high. I suspect the bottom resistance at 6,000 being still artificially held for the benefit of big players. Maybe there's another bull run any time in the future, but immediately the block chain will get stuck again and fees will jump to the moon faster than the price. Basically the 20k peak demonstrated that it couldn't work on a large scale. 
Sorry for the bad picture, but that is how I see it. Usually people say it will get better with mass adoption, but see that there is no road to go there: Living on a desert island, you know it would be better to be on the mainland, but without a ship it will remain a dream.

Every guy coming up with such a figure should pay the predicted price multiplied by the number of months until the due date in dollars into a fund, and get it only released when it was true, otherwise people get it refunded to cover their losses partly. 
In this example, 250,000 x 50 = 12.5M dollars paid upfront, to show us that he is serious. 
The higher the prediction and the longer they shift it into the future, the more they pay. Would help to keep that BS under control.

You are perfectly right, but how to explain this to somebody who is religiously bound to such myths? 
The price of something is ALWAYS and ONLY about demand and nothing else, if trade is free. You can starve as a brilliant painter if nobody likes your pics painted with weeks of effort, or you earn millions by kicking a ball on a grass field because thousands of people pay hundreds of dollars each to see exactly you doing that. It's fully irrational in the end.. And this is even true without any currency, one tribal guy would for instance get corn for singing and dancing, and the other one wouldn't. Surely when an economy develops from a tribe, there are some logically comparable things like, you give me one hen and I give you two pounds of corn, etc. And even later, economies of scale kick in. But imagine that the neighbor village would be vegetarians: Then there is no demand for hens, so their price is actually zero. When the others ask them to sell their hens, there is no demand at all regardless of the effort. But you were obviously aware of all this already ��

No beans required, there is enough other food. There are lots of very useful things in the world, but their price is determined by the external demand. A demand is heavily influenced by many circumstances, such as location, time, available alternatives, expectations, experiences, appeal and attitude in general, and many others. Useful things like beans may have a constant and foreseeable demand, which may help to make their price rather stable. And there is no hype because beans are boring, which helps again to keep the price stable. But there is nothing intrinsic in a stable market demand, it's all coming from the outside.

I see, in your personal reality, things have a mysterious value in itself, which should somehow explain why the market price of anything can vary and can be zero as well, and why companies which offer useful products nevertheless go bankrupt when their production costs are higher than the market price. Since this seems to be a religious belief from you, we can stop here. Oh wait a second, maybe you should know that in Europe, tons of fruit are thrown away by the producers every year due to overproduction, and earlier for years, governments bought beef and butter to create artificial demand to support the low prices caused by overproduction. Intrinsic value because it's eatable, ok.

If you are full already, or if you don't like beans and have other food available, or if you have no cooking device, you will not pay anything for beans because they are worthless for you. On the other hand, you might pay very much money for beans when you are very hungry and no other food is available. So the value of the beans is completely driven by external circumstances. No intrinsic value is given in anything, it's only driven by the demand. And the demand is driven by multiple factors of a current situation.

There is no intrinsic value in anything. Value is only created by demand, and depending on several factors. I don't know why everybody here want to believe against any common sense, that effort to create something makes it valuable for somebody else.

Maybe this has been discussed many times already but I still don't get the point: Given the idea that BTC should work as a currency, why do some of you want it to gain incredible value in very short time, and why do you think it's necessary to hold lots of BTC forever? To me, this seems to be not only two different targets, but also contradictory ones. In the fiat world, you would use a currency with a very precise gut feeling about its value looking at the goods you can buy for it, and you have lots of sources of information to see its (necessarily rather stable) precise value when comparing to other currencies. You would hold it only for the reason of being able to pay something immediately, and to keep your fortune when there is no better option at the moment. Whereas, when you want something which gains value over time, you would use shares, or houses, or rare old cars. Since I appreciate so much the underlying technology of BTC, it would be worth to see it really adopted by the public but it won't, given an average value change of 20 percent per day!
I understand that one of the essential targets of BTC is, that it must never be controlled by any institution. But, and this is what I am really convinced of, you must get rid of the soaring and the crashing, and of the daily 20 percent ups and downs.
The key question is, wouldn't it be possible to get an algorithmic solution for that stability issue?
The BTC community obviously has a lot of super brains. After the brilliant idea of implementing the LN, I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this: get the BTC value stabilized by algorithms. Surely it must gain value over time when the community grows, due to the limited amount of bitcoins, but this process must be steady, foreseeable and without surprises. After you have managed that, I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling, and these will then be lots and lots people who are not inside the technology but who are just using it for all the advantages it has. Smartphones are used all the time by billions of people because they are so terribly convenient, but how many of them know all the technology? It doesn't matter to them because it works anyway. I think a technology is mature enough for the really big world when a standard user doesn't need to know anymore how it works. The "user experience" of using BTC for payment must just "it's working always and everywhere", and the next key success factor is a very reliable stability of its value. 
Unless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks. Of course the winners of this game will be at least millionaires at the end, but millionaires in fiat money, and this still ongoing gambling game will not cause any progress on the original idea of crypto currency.

In Germany, you can run a one man business either under your own name or founding a company with limited liability, and this is similar in most countries as far as I know. I am aware of this and also of several helpful special constructs which can be legally set up between these two simple types. But for instance, most people must buy their own house under their own name, husband and wife together, because otherwise the bank won't give you the high required loan. Only people with enough money can found something like an asset management company "Ltd." So when you say it's not about hiding, then you are looking for something similar for crypto. The general setup of having an asset management company should be available for crypto assets as well, this shouldn't be different. The way I understand it, most of your financial transactions would be by the company, so any lawsuit regarding your crypto activities might only go against the company, and your private assets are protected by the liability limit and the separation of company and private assets. 
But I cannot see how this could be achieved without having this separation of assets by your own company. Law will require disclosure of the legal ownership of the crypto, and if this is not you or your own company, I would be afraid that any other party would be the legal owner and could take them away.

Yes they are hovering and it goes up and down because both huge currencies are under free trade of everybody. But please see that the governments do a lot of activity every day to get this somehow balanced at least. Maybe the biggest issue the upcoming crypto has, some schemes try to use a pair of coins, one stable and one unstable, to provide both a currency and an asset coin, but also them still to prove whether they work.
Especially for the BTC, I don't see how to make it stable. It's a chicken and egg problem for wider adoption.

Several topics got mixed here, let me separate them. 
If somebody who dies has debts, the heir has to stand in and to pay the money back.
PayPal got so big mainly as the trusted middleman which was missing before, and such a middleman will still be required when you buy something, for instance if the physical item you bought is faulty or the wrong one. Don't believe that real world complaints can be solved by computers. PayPal does not compare to crypto here, they would rather let you use your crypto if it would be convenient and stable enough, and would still take their fees.
But I don't say PayPal are nice guys, they're a huge company who want to earn as much money as possible. So easy to imagine they would use wrong words in the situation above, and they don't care where from the heir would get the money to pay them back, or how this guy feels.

Sure much less fraud possible this way. But I wanted to point out that there is a last and important organizational level in such security networks of fiat and CC schemes. I read desperate posts here from crypto guys when something is going wrong with crypto, and often there's nobody else to help than this community.. Crypto urgently requires working complaint and refund processes, and trusted middlemen, regardless whether the tech itself is trustless - but I don't see many crypto guys who are actually aware of this.

Well, he should have said, the central banks do a lot of things to keep the inflation rate of the Euro close to 2 percent, whereas nobody is taking care of the relative value of BTC.
Currently Bitcoin behaves deflationary and oscillating, which makes it comparable to highly speculative assets.
In this shape, you cannot use it as a currency, because you cannot determine the value of any goods in Bitcoin even for a short future period. For instance, when you plan to buy food for your family in 7 days, you don't know whether you will pay 0,01 BTC or 0,015 BTC. It's like you would have to pay 100 or 130 Euros which matters a lot in daily life. And, you wouldn't even want to spend the 0,01 BTC because you suppose that two days later, it might only be 0,008 BTC. Whereas with Euros, you can plan to spend 100 Euros for the food during the next months. In two years, it will be rather 104 Euros to get the same. Inflationary, but moderate and you can plan with it.

For instance, current price already includes a lot of hope for the CBOE ETF to be approved in August. If delayed, disappointment will cause a drop immediately after these news are out. However, delay is super probable because SEC will want to use all the time allowed, but they have to stick to the rules which don't allow to claim the full possible time at once. So after this likely drop, wait and see. If this ETF is not granted in the end, further outlook is not good.

Please understand that the European banking system is somehow ahead, and EU forced some improvements as well. Almost no checks needed any more. Bank to bank transfer is so simple that you can do it at the POS in seconds. Usually transfers are available the same day or the next day. Internet accounts often run for free, only some banks insist on fees. Working processes to quickly dispute debit notes (and only processed with your prior consent). Apps for everything you want to do on your account with security promises, banks take the liability. So the user experience is not like a dinosaur here, it fits modern life.

Sure, there is an inflation rate but it's 2 percent per year and it's somehow predictable. So in times of zero interest rate, not all your property should be on a bank account, but it's super easy to deal with the stable circumstances the classic banks offer.

Not a lawyer, but no lack of understanding either. Appreciate the lot of effort you did to show the details. I think your ideas might work as long as crypto is still something exotic. Laws and regulations take time because governments need to adopt kind of understanding in the first place, for that they need tech experts, then economy experts, then law experts. They do research and finally come up with ideas how to regulate and how to make sure that a normal person can't hide too much from them. I don't believe they let you own lots in crypto anonymously in the future, but yes this is an assumption.

For Internet transactions, you still have the choice to stick with typing the CVC which is a low security thing, but you can choose to go for an advanced security scheme which is called 3D Secure, using your smartphone. Have to admit that I didn't use it yet so I don't know whether it's working well.
In real shops, I think to make contactless payments more convenient, they would waive the PIN up to a certain amount, however controlled by the risk parameters of the chip and the bank, so hopefully no security hole. But you can't avoid chip and pin processing when demanded by the terminal at the POS.
But it depends on the bank and the card, my low cost card is still using chip and signature..

I am afraid that BTC will stay in a technical niche because the miracle of stability will never happen just by chance, and therefore it's useless for the majority of people. 
PayPal does not claim to be a currency but they solved two major issues of internet users: you don't want to give your account details to everybody, and you want someone who guarantees that your payment is properly treated i.e. you will actually get your goods. They were the first to solve this on a large scale.

No, exchange rates are built at millions of stock exchanges all over the world, and billions of traders actually do transactions based upon these rates. This is not centralized information. A stabilization algorithm will of course have to look at multiple sources of information and use multiple fiat currencies for the cross check. BTC must not be "bound" to any of them, the stabilization must be like the suspension in a car.
It is a matter of fact that BTC will be "yet another" currency in the world for the foreseeable future, so everybody must have the chance to know how much they can buy the next day for their BTC to use it regularly. This includes that exchange rates to fiat money are an essential topic for BTC to succeed.

Exchange rates are public information which are kept up-to-date within seconds across the world. The algorithm must virtually buy BTC when the value gets lower too fast and must release them again when the price gets higher too fast. Must be an open algorithm known to and executed by the community. I did not say it is easy.. but I would rely on people who can invent blockchain and LN which seems much much more complicated.

I think the date was August 16, and the most probable decision IMO will be no decision but further delay. Might cause a drop nevertheless due to the disappointment.

Maybe everytime when you invest in BTC, you spend the same amount buying any lottery share. Compare over some years time which "investment" will make it.

The real price is 2,40 in the resto next to my flat, but it wasn't only 1 EUR ten years ago as proposed above in the example, but rather 1,90. Agreed that this is more than 2 percent rise, but other goods went even down in price since then..

Deflationary currencies don't work.

I cannot see the difference. If BTC is 100k on Monday, 150k on Wednesday, 50k on Friday, what did you actually pay for the coffee ☕? And how many BTC should you accept as the price for your next coffee?

Banks and stock exchanges in very different countries such as e.g. US, Russia, China, Japan, leading Arab and European countries will not be willing and able to work together to manipulate something. Exchange rates belong to the most transparent things in the world, I agree that states, big business and banks can influence them but still the influenced rates are then reality for everyone so anybody including an algorithm can act and react accordingly. It is not possible to give a falsified information to BTC or anybody else regarding the actual exchange rates.

Mathematically, playing a lottery is the same as paying for an insurance. In both cases, you bet on something very unlikely to happen.

I was commenting on PayPal only because it was mentioned before. It has a lot of flaws for sure, but the "user experience" of the majority is that it works well and super convenient. That's why it was widely adopted by non-technical people who don't care how it works internally.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:04:52
So you believe that some secret agents all over the different countries will cooperate to give a fake rate to BTC while everybody else is still trading on "real" rates.. This is very unlikely and it could also be avoided by the algorithm. Sounds rather like a conspiracy theory to me.

It's not a mistake to play some lottery for fun. First get your expenses and savings done of course, then use a small amount which is left over just to give it a try. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:42:56
Yes that's what I meant. Your house getting struck by lightning has a similar probability as winning in the lottery. In both cases you play the game and pay for it, the only difference is that you would like the one event to happen and the other one not.

Looks like a doctrine, getting somehow religious. However such strict communities usually don't reach a wider audience and stay as rather small groups of firm believers who try to make the world believe that they are on the right path.

Disbelievers are supposed to be mentally ill. Fits into the picture. I stop here since you are using insults instead of rational arguments. Bye.

See that I said "shall" and "theory", I'm not saying that all of it turned out to be always right. In Germany, average wages have been rising moderately, the rises being eaten by the inflation when looking at the goods that can be bought. Feelings actually are important for macroeconomics, after WWII the Germans got a new currency and were told it's backed by their future GDP.. and they believed it and trusted in the new Deutsche Mark, made it one of the hardest currencies ever, more stable than the Euro later. 
Understand your point on inflation, seems it wasn't necessary as long as the demand was so big that basically everything could be sold, you only needed to be able to supply (which however was the big challenge then). But markets went into saturation in the 70s and it was no longer as easy as to just expand production to make more profit, and thus to provide positive outlooks to your shareholders. The vendor market turned into a buyer market, there's too many things to buy, no more flaws in any supply. Since shareholders want to see their assets grow, you need more profit at least in the nominal figures. And you need to pay more money to your employees to make them feel confirmed for their efforts. That's how I was told the inflationary spiral would work, until now it mainly succeeded to do that in Germany.

You need not do it if you fear to lose control over yourself or your expenses.

Of course BTC must remain decentralized, I did not suggest to change that because then it's not BTC any more. The algorithm must, in an open and decentralized way, make sure that when e.g. BTC rates would go down by more than 5 percent within 8 hours when compared to a basket of fiat currencies, BTC coins are put into a buffer stock. And vice versa.
Gold and other rare raw materials are not used for daily payments but for investment and speculation. So BTC will not be a currency if it wants to behave like gold.
I made the example with gambling and penny stocks because you cannot do any reasonable investment into BTC as it behaves now. See the chart after the 20,000 peak, at what point in time could you seriously have bought or sold? This is pure lottery, sorry to say.

Good to live in a society which is not playing according to these rules.
There are people who are sick, people who have children, people who have to care about disabled relatives, not everybody is strong enough to survive in a shark pool.
