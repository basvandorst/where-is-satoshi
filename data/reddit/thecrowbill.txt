Theoretically, it can never matter to the functionality of Bitcoin what value at any given instant one Bitcoin represents. Because it is not a fiat currency where an exchange of physical objects (or the electronic equivalent of such) takes place, a Bitcoin can be electronically divided to represent a fractional value as small as necessary to complete any transaction. Theoretically...

IANAL, but I can think of several ways to fight this. First, we're dealing with trademarks not patents. A registered trademark is a brand recognition tool registered by company for the exclusive promotion of their product or service. A patent, by contrast, refers to the legal ownership of a design or concept for a physical product. Since we're dealing with branding and promotion rather than manufacturing and products, domain name registrants such as bitgold should have no trouble showing that they were the established service provider prior to the usurper's claim on that trademark.

Mycelium is a wonderful mobile wallet with many "extra" features. I would like to see the developers produce a Windows app or a browser extension for added accessibility.

Thanks, I'll look into it.

Short answer: possibly.

Ewww. That's not very promising. Did they charge your bank for the purchase?

Thanks for responding. I am now trying to open a support request with Gildera. Their website (as well as Mycelium's) could certainly use some more intuitive support information.

I like your idea, learning programming through Bitcoin,  but I think you are missing an important distinction. What you say about everyone being a programmer nowadays may be true. What you are talking about, however, is not so much programming as it is coding. To use your washing machine analogy, the "programmer" chooses which of the functions provided from the machine's manufacturer they want performed for each particular load. The program they choose may be quite complex, but it is limited to the functions and options that are available using the machine's control panel. This is essentially the algorithm level of programming. Were the user of the machine to require a function other than what is available using the machine's control panel , they would need to change or add to the functions at the hardware level. That is coding. Good luck in your endeavor. I will be on the lookout for it.
