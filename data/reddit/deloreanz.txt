What are some practical applications for distributed computing on homomorphically encrypted data?  It seems to me that the secure computation of data is what differentiates Enigma from a distributed data storage system like Storj or MaidSafe.  I had a similar idea for an alt coin a few years ago but I think I stopped looking into it due to certain limitations on the kind of work that can be done on data encrypted this way.

Probably no more expecting Chase to be a Wells Fargo killer.  There's room for at least two companies in this space, and considering the agreements Coinbase already has as a payment processor I wouldn't expect them to be going anywhere.

Yes, but it'll take use cases like this where people have a clear advantage to use bitcoin rather than traditional options.  They probably won't even know they're using bitcoin.  People generally don't care about TCP/IP but they can't live without their facebook updates.

The problem with looking for matching chunks of text in the address, like the beginning and end as you suggested, is that an attacker could generate a vanity address to match those sections.
I had an idea once that apps might be able to use custom icons for each address similar to gravatars, using a subset of characters to generate a unique image, but an attacker could simply spoof this if the technique was reverse engineered.  In the end I think a (hopefully distributed) service could help users manage their addresses because much or all of its characters are needed to ensure security.

Agreed.  I think those of us in the US don't realize how terrible the money system is in other places in the world.  Our system is far from perfect but bitcoin is a godsend in places where money isn't a reliable tool.

I'm not trying to throw gas on the fire, but I distinctly remember thinking people were stupid for buying thousands of bitcoin when it crashed from $30 to a few bucks.
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:15:31
I was going to buy Tesla stock after visiting a store and being very impressed having seeing their tech and plan in person, but then decided against it because analysts (read financial weathermen) advised strongly against it.  I could have lived with losing several thousands buying at $30/share, but the possibility of a dramatic price increase (turned out to be 10x) would be worth that risk.
I recall the general public consensus that the iPhone and iPad were going to fail, but having seen those in person on launch and understanding what they brought to the table I was betting they'd make a lot of money for Apple.
tl;dr Being informed can help justify or reduce risk.

I'm reminded of the technicality that Blizzard's lawyers used to shut down WoW Glider.  IIRC they used the DMCA to claim Glider was illegally making copies of WoW since it would copy variables (like player names, spawn locations) from WoW's memory into its own, even though you could argue they weren't copies since they were in volatile memory.

That may still be a good buy if they're holding long term.  I'm pretty terrible at day trading so I'll buy and hold until selling is a life-changing event.

I'm all for bullish bitcoin calculations, but the assumption that every person on earth could have at least $1 is silly.  Several billion don't even have bank accounts, to some people $1 is a fortune, and its not hard to imagine many don't have any practical access to technology.  Of the 7B, about 2B are children.  Sure things can change but I think you're better off starting with a subset that you know could practically end up owning some bitcoin.

That's just one mining company and you're assuming that's an accurate statement.  Of course they'd want everyone to believe they have a huge margin and "significantly" is subjective.
Mining companies are going to compete for blocks and expand their operation while its still profitable.

Why are they listing BFL as a source for bitcoin mining hardware?!

@_date: 2014-10-21 00:45:09
Ya I agree.  This was just a fun little test but we'd run one or several full nodes with web API fail overs for any production project.  It got us thinking about some ways bitcoin could be used with hardware like this.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:49:36
At first I agreed with you but then considered that miners will most likely mine as long as they make a profit, so we could assume the network operating cost is at most the value of the coins being mined.  Given the level of competition I'd guess the cost is about equal to the income, if not more due to speculation or miners trying to minimize losses.
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:55:53
I actually thought the same thing back when it crashed from $30 to a few bucks.  I'm glad I panic held.

I once asked Andreas about this and to date its the best reason I've heard for why Bitcoin's PoW should be useless for any other purpose, more so than the relative power usage argument.  He suggested that if the PoW was based on protein folding or some other valuable service, fluctuations in those markets would indirectly affect Bitcoin mining and value.
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:06:57
At a first glance I thought this meant I could fax Bitcoin to someone.
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:38:37
Of course.  But the core point here is that all dedicated SHA256 Bitcoin mining hardware can only benefit the Bitcoin network as long as it's significantly larger than other networks.  The reason for this is no serious SHA256 alt coins will pop up for fear of Bitcoin miners pointing their machines to the alt coin network to perform a 51% attack.  This has happened to several coins but I forget which at the moment.  In this way one coin dominates an algorithm, effectively claiming ownership over the machines running its algorithm.  Obviously if a coin started to decline or some catastrophic news came out, its possible miners could migrate their ASICs to another coin.
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:40:18
You're forgetting the value of the Bitcoin mining ASICs that exist.  Sure Bitcoin has developer momentum but millions of dollars of dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware out there provides orders of magnitude more security than other smaller networks.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:57:43
And you felt it necessary to rub it in their faces with a snide remark.
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:31:43
There could be more innovative features for a new coin to offer, but attempting to stop a network hashing majority and faster transactions for merchants seem like a winning combination; security and easier adoption.
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:25:24
ASICs for mining by definition put more power into less hands.  It's more likely that a room full of ASICs would exist under one person's control than a warehouse of GPUs.  An attack could come from any source but some are more financially feasible than others.  As for cpus in a botnet, you'd need 500k computers running at full tilt to attempt an attack.
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:34:28
One major advantage to Litecoin, or any coin that's not a scam is it offers a great way to swap back and forth between crypto currencies.  If you're speculating with BTC and think it's hit a peak for a bit, you can swap into another coin quickly and back into BTC.  This seems a faster and cheaper way to go about it than cashing back into fiat.
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:27:41
Litecoin's has been growing, and personally I've done well with it while BTC had it's dips.  I think the true value lies in a coin that's used, and right now LTC is pretty limited so its price currently is probably more speculation than anything.
As for volatility, looking at historic charts I don't see how you could differentiate LTC from BTC.

From what I read, only password hashes were stored and stolen.  If that's the case a hacker couldn't access your email even if you had the same password.
Rather than breaking into email accounts with stolen passwords, it seems the worst they could do is get into forum accounts and read any personal data there.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:32:11
Exactly.  Asking people to change their perception of the word hacker and understand bitcoin at the same time is just not going to happen.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:59:23
That and MtGox inducing crashes.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:14:56
You're assuming that buyers of ASICs are only people who won't attempt an attack.  An attacker would have to buy a majority of any sort of hardware, the difference with ASICs is that barrier is lower now.  They may start out mining legit but anyone who has a majority can attempt the attack and even if they never intend to the security risk is always there.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:39:11
Every time I see a new peak I think to myself, "I'll be looking back and thinking this price point was a steal."
I remember distinctly doing that at $87, $100, and $140.  I even remember thinking people were fools for buying thousands when it tanked to $2.
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:32:35
The term implies a person gaining access to something they shouldn't, or twisting something for their own benefit.  
Ask any family member what they think of when you say the word 'hacker' and you'll get your answer.

Doesn't anyone remember what happened to [Jim's Drugs store after Walmart was destroyed](  Seriously though throwing weight into other markets doesn't guarantee they won't do the same thing, and even if the market share is distributed more evenly there will still be people screwed by one market or another when they mess up.
In the same way we want our currency distributed, I'd push for markets being so as well.  I've read some discussion about this on the bitcointalk forums.

Another large difference is transaction and validation time is quicker in Litecoin due to the faster rate of coin generation, one block being generated every 2.5 minutes.  This will also lead to 4x more Litecoins than Bitcoins in existence when mining is done.  Since coins can be broken up into fractional portions I don't think having more really matters much.
Unfortunately GPUs were made to work with the 'scrypt' algorithm so GPU mining is far better than CPU.  It remains to be seen if FPGAs or ASICs are financially valid for Litecoin mining.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:24:18
