Does the transaction show up on the blockchain?  If so, it is legit. By legit, i mean you have those BTC. 
As to "withdrawing". There is no withdrawal. You are in possession of the BTC, not some bank. 
If you wish to convert to some more usable currency, you can do so via exchanges, but be aware that exchanges of 10k or more will trigger automatic money laundering alerts. 
I would spend the coin directly at places that accept BTC.

Two factor authentication token. It generates a one-time code according to some known algorithm. When you log-in, the server also generates this code internally. It compares what you enter at log-in to what it has generated, and if they match, you're in, if not, your're not.
It provides an additional layer of security to just a password.

@_date: 2017-11-04 09:55:03
Why would you not compile it? One of the main reasonings behind running your own node is trust, and using precompiled binaries mitigates that trust. I realise that auditing the source and compiling everything is ridiculously impractical, but the bar of compiling bitcoin core is so low that I don't understand why it would not be done.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:26:26

@_date: 2017-11-29 10:23:23
They are both based on the same hashing algorithm, so the same address may be generated by a wallet, but they are not the same chain, so sending coin to an address you don't own means they end up somewhere else.
Seems that address has seen little activity... it's going to be hard to find out who owns it. I'd say your LTC are gone.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:30:17

They're kind of like an independent witness to transactions. The more independent nodes the higher the trust factor in the overall system.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:30:31
Thanks. I'll have a read.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:55:54
Well no, not really. IRS is an agent of the US government that collects tax, nodes are validators of transactions. If you have only one witness to transaction, there would be no way to prevent double-spending, i.e. sending the same BTC to two different addresses. With multiple witnesses, this becomes impossible, or at least extremely difficult.

Of what? BTC? That's exactly the opposite of what you want...
Of some other currency? USD? Very unlikely.
Lets say you got your terminology wrong and you meant to say 'hyperdeflation'. Even in that situation, value would be directly tied to utility, and if enough people don't see the utility of BTC (or any crypto) it will increase in value for sure, but nowhere near the curve some people are predicting - i.e. everyone wants a slice of a pie of limited size.
BTW, so we're clear, I am pretty bullish on crypto as a technology, but I don't see the global appeal some people predict.

@_date: 2017-10-20 09:38:10
This is one of those instances where I would steer away from pre-packaged deployment and towards building from source. It is difficult to have complete trust in something that is obscured by layers of abstraction, particularly when its compromise has such high potential worth.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:28:25
Point 2 means that I have a fairly spacious server that I use for other stuff, which has a disk partition allocated specifically for storing the blockchain. I then attach this partition to the raspberry pi over the network, so it sees it as a local directory.
This means that I can just boot the Pi off a small SD card, but still have lots of storage pretty cheaply.

As you can see, it's only 197G at the moment, but one of the joys of LVM on Linux is you can grow a volume pretty painlessly.
On the cliient it looks like this... basically the server (192.168.1.222) exports a filesystem which the client mounts and makes appear like it on the Pi

What if I told you a bitcoin has no value? In fact, 'a bitcoin' doesn't even exist.
@_date: 2011-06-17 09:18:13
Yeah, it is a pretty serious issue alright. Couple of things to bear in mind, though. 
1. We are very early adopters. We are the ones ironing out the usage bugs. The design from a crypto standpoint is solid, but the fact that it relies on a very insecure infrastructure for transactions and storage is a major issue at the moment. 
2. Infosec companies are already looking at solutions to this problem. Tools which provide seamless encrypted lock-and-release of the wallet file are probably only a few months away. Handling of two wallets, much like you would a savings and deposit account is just a matter of discipline.
I don't expect BTC to be accepted in the mainstream for a while yet. I mean, it is a fairly big mind-shift in how exchange can work. Of course, it may fail entirely too, but I'm gonna hedge on the side of success.
@_date: 2011-06-17 08:51:27
Yeah, a misguided sense of security is very reassuring.
@_date: 2011-05-26 08:15:34

The 5000 series is a different architecture. It will mine slightly faster as an equivalent 6000, but at the expense of higher power consumption.

Ignorance is the problem, not the tools. If people just go with the idea that antivirus is the catch-all solution without even understanding what the problem is, they are doomed to pwnage.

If it was 'designed' this way, then it was poorly designed, not maliciously designed, as implied by 'scam'.
However, it was not 'designed' to enrich early adopters, that is just a function of its model, and a short-term function at that. The gold-rush shows similarities. Gold-rush pioneers were enriched by their mining of gold. However, gold wasn't designed to enrich people either... people decided that it had value and as such people that had gold became rich.

Heh... when I heard about the crack lastnight, I did worry a bit, but I knew that my MTGox p/w was different from my GMail one. I did still go through everything (eBay, Paypal, Amazon etc etc) and change them all anyhow. 5 minutes work, and I slept much better afterwards.
@_date: 2011-05-29 19:02:04
I wouldn't worry about it. I set a pretty aggressive fan profile in MSI Afterburner, and have 2 6950's running at full tilt for over a week now. The GPU core temps hover around 65degC.
I had my single card running for about a week prior to that, with regular fan control, and it was hitting 90degC with no ill effects.
@_date: 2011-05-26 08:14:32
deepbit, and I was at ~310MH on a single 6950. I did the shader unlock, and running at stock clockspeed, my hashrate jumped to a regular ~370MH, but BTC production jumped from ~1 to ~1.4.

He does make one valid point... that the system will be tested at some point. it remains to be seen when and how this will play out.
His other points are based on a short-term view, invalid assumptions and plain empty statements.

Yup. The transaction will sit in the blockchain, but the recipient doesn't get the BTC til the client downloads the blockchain and decrypts the transaction.

Based on current metrics, a 10 character, full 7bit alphabet MD5 hash can be broken in less than a year on a single 6990... scale that to 10 of them and you're looking at a timescale of a month!!
But, you are correct... people that don't take adequate precautions with their passwords are asking to be hacked.
Personally, I use lastpass... unique passwords for everything... 12 chars, full 7bit alphabet.

Nothing wrong with it at all. Thing is, you need to keep your encrypted volume offline at all times, unless you are actually sending or receiving BTC.
What I do is keep my primary bitcoin client and wallet.dat in an encrypted volume on a linux machine that is only accessible via SSL based VPN. I do day to day transactions on my laptop, and immediately forward coins to my primary account, I then log in to the linux box, mount the encrypted volume, open the relevant port, start the client, wait for the transaction to arrive and be verified and then kill the client. I then mount a truecrypt volume in my dropbox, backup my wallet, unmount the truecrypt volume, unmount the local encrypted volume, close the port and disconnect.
This has scripts to make it easier, and only takes about 2 minutes (apart from the block-chain download), but it keeps me safe.
I only have about 50BTC too, so it's not like I am a BTC millionaire, but I do take security seriously.
@_date: 2011-06-11 17:26:28
Not sure why you'd think that. I have 2 6950s crossfired, and I get 2 workers with ~350mh/s opposed to a previous, single worker when I had one card.
@_date: 2011-05-29 19:23:50
If people are speculating, they might be thinking that 35 coins today might be worth $300ish, which is not a bad deal for your xBoxes, but if there is a surge like there was a couple of weeks back, they might be worth 3 or 4 times that. Even though I bought a second GPU on the strength of what it will make for me, I won't be cashing the BTC any time soon.
@_date: 2011-06-20 11:18:34
Even with strong passwords, a poor hashing scheme is little defense in the face of a large-scale GPU hashing attack.
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:36:19
Correct. A two factor auth system is only as secure as the least secure factor. The fact that someone can commandeer that factor with almost no effort basically nullifies the entire system. When a lowly customer service rep is the custodian of your online security, there is something amiss.

Well, maybe not RSA dongles, but some form of 2FA, definitely. Banks do this, and MTGox should treat the sensitivity of their data in a similar way.

Looks like my sources are flawed. Based on your figures, I had another look, and found tests on ighashgpu that are much more in keeping with your figures... almost 42 billion hashes/s for a 62 character keyspace, which when applied to a 127 character space is a few orders of magnitude closer to your figure than mine.
I defer.

Not sure why you were downvoted. It has an online component - your key database, which despite being supposedly encrypted, can be reset or have access reset through some outside access. Thus making  'something I have' into 'something I have *access to* (along with other people)'

I don't not like mtgox, but I strongly dislike that they are the default exchange that people seem to gravitate to. This places a pretty big single-point-of-failure on the ability to exchange BTC. To the untutored, BTC equates to the overall stability of the system, including the ability to exchange BTC for fiat and vice-versa. A weakpoint like mtgox, makes the overall concept look bad, and untrustworthy.
Of course, a more positive viewpoint might be to consider mtgox a sort of technological clearing-house for processes and mechanisms to make BTC exchange a more resiliant and secure procedure. Let them make all the early-adopter mistakes, and let the rest learn from them, and implement means of dealing with them.

This baffles me. I mean over the last 15 years, we have seen the reinvention of the music and movie distribution industry and publishing is equally undergoing huge rework.
