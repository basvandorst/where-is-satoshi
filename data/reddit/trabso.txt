The "nobody will run a full node if blocks get big even though it is essential to run a full node or else you trust someone else who does" argument is circular. People will run full nodes because of this very concern, so there is no 'node death spiral' as is often claimed or implied.
The very fact that people aren running full nodes now is proof that the trust issue has not arisen yet. As it does, interest in running full nodes will soar. It's a self-solving problem, and the lack of imagination is with the Core Commisars who can't seem to imagine a problem solving itself without their intervention.

That's actually how Bitcoin is now, except instead of users being able to configure everything in their clients directly, they'd have to download other code versions that have the settings they want. Sure, make everything adjustable by the user. Users won't adjust things like the block reward because they know they'd get forked off. Duh. 
Conflating block reward with blocksize demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of Bitcoin, like an engineer who assumes wearing no clothes in public is just another fashion statement. Though they are both just code changes, one has incentives behind and the other doesn't.

Arriving at developer consensus is such a nice vision. The nice thing about dev consensus is that if it cannot be achieved, nothing changes and no one is shafted. It also makes it so nothing can interfere with your business model for Blockstream, since you can always veto any change that would endanger that business model. This sounds very constructive for sidechains and LN. A big thanks for your contributions.

People can catch buyers easily by posing as sellers. Unlike with home deliveries where there is plausible deniability ("Anyone could have sent that package as a frame job"), the buyer checking in the crevice of a tree has no such plausible deniability. Especially after the buyer walks off with the item. 
Buyers using drones to do their pickup would be harder to deal with, though other drones could just tail them to their final destination. It'd be an arms race. As drones developed cloaking techniques, tracking tech would likely improve. Not to mention the seller can just include a small GPS in the package (though buyer drones could try to detect this, and on and on the arms race goes).
Buyers would probably try making the dropzone be their residence porch or mail slot and specify that fake postal markings and stamps be put on the package for plausible deniability, but that would degenerate to the simpler existing system (except the need for stealth in packaging).

You're assuming the shifting of capacity over to sidechains would only effect sidechain security, when in fact it affects Bitcoin security as a whole by changing mining incentives.
@_date: 2016-12-06 02:05:39
However valid that path may be, it doesn't change the fact that artificially limiting the main chain when the main chain can be safely expanded much further opens up the floodgates to altcoin competition. Altcoins can use sidechains and payment channels, too. If an altcoin is safe with a 10MB blocksize limit, it will have an order of magnitude advantage over Bitcoin. The network effect is not infinite.

Hashrate-schmashrate. Anyone can change the protocol and the ecosystem can follow, with different mining method.
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:48:23
Exactly. The economic majority can "force" changes, but it can't force anyone outside that majority to accept them. If Theymos and others want to keep using 1MB Bitcoin or something marginally bigger, Coinbase and the economic majority have no power stop them. Their smallblock coin just may not be very valuable anymore, perhaps "forcing" them to adopt the economic majority's version (but there is of course no actual forcing happening, any more than a big investor bidding the price up tenfold would "force" people to take profits).

Or is it? A simple fork removes the paralysis. It's like Life Selector.
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:56:13
You're not getting it. Hard forks *are* Bitcoin's consensus model whenever a controversial choice must be made. If that is not the case, we may as well pack up and go home because there are going to be plenty of controversial choices in Bitcoin's future. The quasi-consensus enjoyed for the first few years was a luxury, and really more of an illusion caused by Satoshi having dictatorial control. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:09:38
While I agree Core is dragging its feet, this clip was far too short to tell anything (were they groaning at Greg starting to answer or at Michael's question?). But the question was dumb in the first place. Every implementation has a de facto dictator, and yet Bitcoin has no dictator because everyone can choose which implementation they want to run. 
"Dictator" has always been a dumb word for the repository maintainer in the context of Bitcoin. The solution to political gridlock within a project is multiple competing implementations, not some special governance structure for the One True Implementation, whether that is a "dictator" or something else. Governance structure within one "official" implementation is the wrong place to be focused on. Bitcoin's governance structure must be decentralized, but not by incongruously attempting to decentralize one implementation.
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:07:06
US treasuries are a pretty special case, being backed by full faith and credit of the most powerful government in the world. Bitcoin doesn't have anything like that to help it.
@_date: 2015-11-07 06:59:55
The economic majority of Bitcoin users will *always* have control over the highest market cap chain that is called Bitcoin, almost by definition. If there were a way around this by devs or forum owners doing something with governance or moderation, Bitcoin would be a dead end project.

Excellent summary of why this painting of certain positions in the blocksize debate as "centralist" and "decentralist" is a desperate propaganda tactic. 
Some might believe we only need [a few nodes]( spread around to different jurisdictions, but most want at least thousands of nodes all around. The goal is the same: immunity from central command and control, maximum resistance to attack and censorship. Governments need to be addicted to Bitcoin and the economic benefits it brings. This cannot happen at small quaint sizes.

What do you mean "went" so well? The decision time to adopt a fork will usually end up being near the last minute. I'm sure that most players would prefer to get their blocksize cap increase through Core, and still hold out hope that it will happen. After the scaling conference particularly. 
It makes no sense to judge success of a fork-based market decision before the market is forced to make that decision, especially when it may not be forced to make the decision at all. Alternative implementations wait in the wings in case Core stalls for too long, but there is still time. Not a lot of time, but enough to keep the market patient for now.
@_date: 2015-11-13 13:44:16
Exactly. And "fewer nodes" is a non sequitur because adoption fuels the desire/need for various parties to run nodes. Smallness is a poor way of getting the benefits of decentralization, which are immunity to centralized control and attack.

You're making a disingenuous argument asking for specifics that Blockstream hasn't made public. (Their business model, how they hope to profit.) This is rich after you just accused parent of concern trolling. Not knowing their business model, it makes sense to be concerned. You know how to play an audience, I'll give you that.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:25:57
I think you overestimate how natural the kind of dynamic thinking you're using comes to people. Most people can't think past "look at the trend, if we extrapolate..." imagining that miners are automatons that do not think for themselves, and the same of investors and infrastructure. There's a strong attitude of over-planning where the feeling seems to be, "If we don't design things so that they happen deterministically, they won't happen." Markets just don't work like that.
@_date: 2015-11-13 13:37:20
Both you and the OP are throwing around ill-defined terms. What does "fully decentralized" even mean. What we really want is resistance to all manner of central control and attack. 
Agree with what I think your point is -- the *degree* of decentralization is a means to an end, not something to be fetishized.

As I said initially, ASIC commodification assures eventual decentralization.

Pooled mining is not ideal at all, but it is nevertheless a blatant mischaracterization to say "3 [pool operators] control mining," as Gregory Maxwell just did. He seems to be using it as a talking point to further his agenda, because it is deliberately stripped of important nuance.

This seems different from the usual idea of a smart contract, which requires a robust ecosystem of oracles to avoid centralization risk in determining the truth. If Hedgy is the one authoritative oracle, what's really the difference between this and just having it be a contract with Hedgy included as a party, other than fancy blockchain trappings?

Gold has an enormous market cap, in the trillions. Still, it didn't get there without having been mainstream for millennia and still largely mainstream accepted in many countries, especially unstable monetary regimes. Bitcoin cannot go from virtually useless for everyday people straight to reserve status. It just don't work that way. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:19:11
We were talking about cost to miners *and* users. To users the dollar amount rising absolutely matters. Mining costs in fiat are relevant, too, as we are talking about marginal cost of inclusion for each additional transaction.

@_date: 2015-11-10 16:08:39
Well you can just fork the code and make your own commits. If the market likes it, you're good to go.
Peter's conflicts of interest don't matter for pull requests, because no one is in control, certainly not him. There are at least three levels of control:
1) The committers have the ability to commit or not commit his pull requests
2) The users and miners have the ability to use or not use the resulting Bitcoin Core version
3) The market has the ability to favor or not favor the Core implementation over a different implementation (via a hard fork underpinned by investment demand)
Now when it comes to whether to take something Peter says on authority, the conflict of interest does arise. But in Bitcoin you should never take what anyone says on authority, so this is basically moot. There are no real VIPs in Bitcoin, despite what some want to believe.
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:08:21
Altcoins won't take over. They will merely exert pressure by threatening to take over. The pressure will either push Core to make changes, or drive people (and investment dollars, if it comes to a contentious split) to other implementations *of Bitcoin*, not altcoins.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:40:36
It could happen, but it will only happen (and last) if it absolutely needs to happen. That would mean there really is value in having two versions. Fortunately, every current bitcoin holder would have equal share of both, so no investment loss on your holdings. Each will be worth less, but the total will be the same or likely higher because the assumption in this scenario is that it absolutely needed to happen, so it happening should raise the total value of the system.

Inaction when you're about to trigger an action (start having a transaction capacity that is close to actual transaction volume) that was set to trigger automatically isn't necessarily more conservative.

Commodification of ASICs will make this moot. 
James has this exactly backwards, just like the Scrypt altcoin proponents. ASICs are a good thing. There just happens to be a period where they centralize on their way up the tech curve. Eventually they commodify and the decentralization is even better than with CPU power.

Possibly, but of course it would be an extraordinarily hard sell. Or maybe not, because the point of hard money was to get away from central bankers, not to fetishize absolute numbers. When the market is at the wheel, the whole point of having "money that is hard so that it cannot be diddled with by overlords or committees" becomes irrelevant, because no one person or preset group can diddle with it at all.

It would help if you could say what the lies, distortion, and false equivalencies are. 
You may say that Blockstream won't *actually* do what the napkin drawing says, but parent didn't say that. He only said they *can* do that, which is a highly relevant statement and the drawing communicates the potential threat in the most compact form I can think of. Blockstream may be the noblest organization that ever existed, but since we have no way of knowing that we still have to be aware of the possibility the napkin drawing depicts.

Consider that BTC has risen about four orders of magnitude in five years. How does one *not* get rich off that rise despite investing early? The way to do that is to keep only a small percentage of your assets in BTC at any given time. This requires continually selling off most of your coins, because remember the price is mostlt going up wildly on average so that even if only 10% of your net worth went into BTC in, say, Jan 2013, by summer that is 90% of your net worth. You have to sell about 90% of that off to maintain BTC as only 10% of your net worth. 
You thereby miss almost all the gains.
To ride the bull as it rises, and get rich off it, you really have to keep a high percentage of your net worth in BTC.

Gold has thousands of years of history of the mainstream being involved, and in many countries it still is involved heavily. India, China, Japan, Germany, even a large contingent in the US...though it would be more if the average Joe realized we aren't on a gold standard anymore. The current situation of pure fiat money is a historical anamoly, and a highly unstable one, which is part of why most of us are here.
Bitcoin isn't just going to waltz in and be used by central banks or international corporations as a reserve asset. It absolutely must be heavily demanded by the masses in commerce first, or else these entities will have nothing to buy with it if push comes to shove (the whole point of a reserve asset). 
Think of it this way. If you go to buy a used car from someone, how many people would refuse a gold bar vs. how many people would refuse bitcoins? There is no way to reserve currency status but through mainstream status, because if a good cannot be used to obtain a lot of actual stuff, no one will feel comfortable holding it in reserve.
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:29:05

You talk about razor thin profit margins, but much of the costs in the "income minus cost" equation are sunk costs for equipment purchases, which aren't a factor during the adjustment period almost at all. Also consider commodification of miners ("miner is also a water heater"), which will happen long before 20 years have passed. Furthermore consider the price drops due to the usual Bitcoin volatility much more than a mere halving, coupled with the not-so-razor-thin profit margins point due to sunk costs, and this becomes a pointless concern, especially so far in advance. Seems like you small blockers are pontificating again.
@_date: 2015-11-10 03:27:46
The assumption is that miners can't just switch mining pools if one misbehaves. Of course history shows (DeepBit, GHash) that they can and do, and furthermore that the offending pools slink off to be bit players afterward.
Not to mention that what counts as "the hashing power of Bitcoin" can be changed by a hard fork supported bt investors. I've rarely hear Greg mention investors as part of the equation, even though they hold the ultimate power.
