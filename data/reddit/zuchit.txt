is bitcoin unlimited a scam like one coin?
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:53:59
Weird. I don't understand why us exchanges have creepy kyc process.
KYC process in exchanges in my country were not this bad.
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:23:52
that's bad. there should be a way to fix this right?
can you tell how you got this ransomware? 
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:13:24
me too :D
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:39:53
what happens when someone sends me bitcoin
* before the fork?
* after the fork?
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:34:36
As a foreigner, you may find India to be nice and you may be able to have a good life in metro cities here.
But as a Indian, I hope to move out of this country for various basic reasons. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:36:33
I had a dream that I bought about 5000 bitcoins.
I have no idea how I was able to afford that much of amount in my dream.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:13:06
does going full btc mean you don't have to pay taxes?..
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:30:01
So what does this mean? Will btc value climb again to $400+ ?
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:56:25
I see that this transaction has 7 confirmations. Yet to see it added back to my address.
by wallet, i meant the bitcoin address. I guess that's what you meant by being specific.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:08:09
probably market manipulation by BU whales to create panic and fear about the current situation.
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:00:20
for how long? do you think it'll fall down in value to what it was few months ago? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:35:38
Thanks. Hope BTC stays strong.
@_date: 2017-03-28 05:40:01
Nice. I wanna try this later this year, hopefully on some cloud server.
Do you have any guide on how you set this up?
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:55:50
damn, that's way beyond i ever expected. Would btc value go back to $300 range again? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:48:13
who is gonna use bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:33:12


what if i have coins in both forks? how is that bad?
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:54:14
transactions are not anonymous. Anyone can follow any transaction, which is not easily possible with traditional banking system / cash transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:01:55
makes sense! ty
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:51:59
I'm still hodling to my BTC. This is a tough time, I'm very tempted to convert but I feel that will be an immature decision.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:31:19
Yep, it's about that Ethereum shit. I have received like 5-7 messages since yesterday!
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:56:08
also, people who have fully invested in bitcoin and moved away from fiat.
they have to be lying if they say the price fall doesn't make them nervous.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:48:51
why is  is down for me?
also bitwage.me shows https error on android chrome.
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:25:29
An extreme version of this will roll out in India very soon.
On top of ATM charges for withdrawing own money, they are gonna start charging for even depositing money to their own bank account.
Also, of you dont maintain a minimum balance, they will fine you.
Essentially the system is setup such a way that poor will become even poor because they are gonna get heavily charged even for basic banking.
And all this is changes are put forward by the largest bank in the country that is owned by the govt.
Fk this banking system
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:55:08
there has never been a "storm" like this ever before. the whole existence and reputation of bitcoin is in vain in this current situation.
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:19:31
damn! I have seen over 30 purple balls in last few minutes!
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:10:00
it sounds like a way into a vicious cycle of keeping up hopes on bitcoin rates. 
Anyway, i think i wanna take a slice of what i have and invest the rest into this game.thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:02:42
an company with indian name,  but doesn't support INR.... 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:41:04
ofcourse, you can, but you probably need to post nudes in subs dedicated for that.
let me know if you do ;)
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:04:50
I have no business with them.
But should i be concerned about fork if my btc is in paper wallet?..
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:49:34
oops. soory for misunderstanding. 
wala in Hindi is some who is / has.
bitwala would mean someone who has bits
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:43:47
i'd quit my job if that happens :D
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:42:17


why? how?
@_date: 2017-01-28 14:16:57


what happens if there are no transactions to add ?
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:09:25
yea. fucking already move on with SegWit and shut down those BU dumbfucks!
I can't wait any long. After each day I'm losing faith in BTC because of this uncertainity.
Hope this gets sorted out soon
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:32:10
Okay, that sounds like a reasonable explanation. I was wondering how it was possible for a regular website to have "google" like indexing on mentions of a random string address in internet.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:40:50


You need to have better quality check on your list. I would like to point out that compared to coinsecure or zebpay, www. buyucoin .com is really unprofessional and amateurish. I suggest you to remove that website from the list.That website throw alert on every page load for me. I think developers are developing in production server. lol :D
I have tried all the platforms and to be honest, I think coinsecure is the best exchange and trading platform in India that deserves to be recommended. Their rates are also much better than other platforms.
They have all the guides covered in their website.
How to use: 
Bitcoin for beginners: 
Trading practice: 
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:22:43
what if power got cut off while it's syncing ? Will I have to start over?
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:59:04
I swear i had the same question pop up in my mind when i woke up today.
Anyway, I think as long as it is in a crypto form, it is taxed. I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:33:27
so was it just a refund or did they give a btc as compensation?
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:17:54


so 1 Mbps internet is nowhere enough to run full node right?
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:08:57
looks like you didn't get what i was referring to.
If you look at mentions tab, you can see this reddit post linked there.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:49:59
they are stalking you? wtf?!
@_date: 2017-01-20 10:17:48
thanks. i guess running full node viable in my place.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:14:32
Hey, please add coinsecure.in to the list. It is one of the best exchange platform for india
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:58:16
how does this site can track mentions of this btc address on internet?
If you look at mentions tab, you can see this reddit post linked there. How?
@_date: 2017-01-12 12:33:29
ok, but given the anonymous nature of cc, how is tax authority gonna know if anyone shapeshifted it?
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:47:07
ya, or how is abra different from localbitcoins?..
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:55:15
reading your comment in this thread, i think you are in line to **actually** lose money in someway.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:02:59
Wait, isn't satoshi nakamoto still a mysterious identity?
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:00:43
i think he meant shapeshifting to ETH. It's not tazed unless you convert back to usd right?
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:29:09
man, Switzerland really is the heaven on earth. It was the most beautiful country i ever visited. 
wish i could live there.
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:00:13
would you sponsor visa?
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:06:50
Damn. That's terrible. I have some amount deposited there. Guess i should be moving them.
Hope it gets resolved for you
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:07:32
Bit what about trading?
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:26:46
we're in cryptowar i guess. glad to be a witness!
hope segwit wins
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:04:39
Unless the current drama is solved soon, it will be replaced by other coins.
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:32:41
somebody please hack down that cancer!
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:31:07
Hey mods, this is so unfair. Pay me too /s
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:47:45
I don't know if it's because I'm more technically knowledgeable, but for me it is obvious that its a scammy site. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:26:01
Lol. It'd be tragic is hf happens at that time
@_date: 2017-04-30 04:58:57
Well, they wanna fight? let's fight.
It is very easy to fight against them, just start an anonymous blog calling out them. They will have hard time dealing with taking it down, esp since they themselves are a scam!
We can even delist their site from Google ( I have the privilege to directly contact Google employees, so it won't be that hard to convince them that they are scammers and ask them to take necessary action  )
@_date: 2017-04-19 04:16:27
It's nothing but a troll coin funded by greedy millionaires to stall real development in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-17 04:27:23
Political parties and banks.
We get charged even if atm withdrawal is unsuccessful because of no cash in atm
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:01:29
95% of bitcoin development is done by team called Bitcoin Core. They proposed a solution called Segwit which increases bitcoins txn capacity.
However, BU team wants another solution that give miners more control and ability to increase blocksize. But the problem is mining power is concentrated by few millionaires who manufacture &amp; sell / run bitcoin mining hardware. Going their way means that the future of bitcoin will be at their mercy and greed. This threatens the decentralised nature of bitcoin.
Now for Segwit to get activated, more than 75% miners should activate it. But these few millionaires do not support Segwit because that will effect their earnings.
The current stall means that for a bitcoin txn to go thru, the tnx fees should be higher.
These BU team who are stalling Segwit in bitcoin is profiting from this higher txn fees.
This drama has been going on since last 2 years and I'm not fully aware of depth or all happenings. But from my judgment of observing for last few months, I learned that BU team is incompetent and lack programming skills to develop for bitcoin and we should not trust them with future of bitcoin.
For better understanding and depth of this drama, you should read older threads about the same.
Jihan Wu and Roger are the major culprits who are behind all this issues.

cash shortage is ~~a problem~~ not a problem in some parts of India.
you got it upside down.
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:56:28
the fucker make it sounds like we are criminals.
Didn't expect he was such a snitch
@_date: 2017-04-30 11:01:10
having seen multiple cases of how Google handles reports of hate blogs against company X by angry customer calling a business scam and content policy on their blog platform, I'm sure couple of blogs like that is more than enough to make onecoin go mad as well as have these blogs come in first page search result for their keyword.
On other side, if they try to sue Google, they'll soon realize they are digging their own grave.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:52:55
Been missing the moon posts and our rollar coaster guy.
Hope new price fixes to $1.5 K within next week.
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:37:37
Did you even read the post title? It is an actual news about current situation published last day. Not some made up clickbait shit.
Also, it is not a secret that RBI purposefully reduced cash fund for ATM's to promote "digital" india.
My father is a bank manager and he still has to deal with cash shortage in ATM's but is helpless because RBI won't send enough cash. 2 out of 3 ATM's in most towns / cities in my state are closed due to no cash!
@_date: 2017-04-08 04:02:50
First of all, coinbase or any other exchange​ should not be used as wallet.
You're tota noob if you've been thinking like that.
@_date: 2017-04-30 12:41:41
yep, i'll see what i can do about it ;)
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:56:27
Good to know. I thought it was popular short name like NYC or LA
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:00:18
Pls don't justify using exchange wallets for the sake of easiness.
If not hardware wallets, there​ are good wallets like jaxx and exodus
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:11:02
LMAO. Feeling bad for him. poor guy..
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:51:07
but that ain't gonna help to keep you any more secure! NSA had tools for linux distros as well and it was was leaked too.
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:59:50
Will bitcoin pass $15000 by this year end if segwit gets activated?..
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:03:15
Aparently, some people who commented do not really understand Bitcoin or VC in general.
"The virtual currencies should be regulated. but, in proper manner, need to study and make a rules to regulate it in proper way, all transactions should be done under governments tracking system.
India is growing country and we can not provide international banking facilities in traditional way, it will coast a lot even if we continue with traditional approach, also takes too much time, so, if we want better future and compete with the world then we must go with the future."
"Bitcoin should recognise the Indian government.
It's benefit..
Indian income will increase.
through every transaction to the form of tax."
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:52:40
what a shitshow! :/
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:42:46
Exactly. I think it is time to use satoshi unit. My friend is not that confident in getting into bitcoin for same reason. Though, I have suggested him to start with 0.001 BTC but not sure he's willing for that.
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:52:04
only to get visa denied?..
I had the golden opportunity to visit MTV this year, but due to political situation, Google decided to send us elsewhere.. :/
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:45:19


only if you want to add on to your losses. This piece of shit country is too fucking hot and humid and power loss is very common every day on top of expensive electricity cost.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:07:47
I guess we don't need moon guy for every 100$ increase now. It's getting little boring tbh. 100$ increase don't feel like big deal for bitcoin atm. 
Bitcoin is now at whole another level and i prefer to see him every 1000$ increase until it's not a big deal.
I expect to see more of moon guy at ~$1950 + very soon.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:44:41
I feel exchagnes here are going crazy.
coinsecure disabled access to exchange via web browser.
btcxindia stopped trading  BTC and replaced it with XRP!
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:48:20
BTC is pretty expensive there. Coinsecure is the best exchange 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:44:14
smart contract feature will thrive along with automation.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:17:50
What do you use bitcoin for? I bet you are hodling it under your ass like all other wannabe millionaires
