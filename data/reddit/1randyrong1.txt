So he was very clear this is towards scammy, unethical faith healers etc... not just any church. But! Why could we not also worship Bitcoin, our savior from the root of all evil!

I think taxes are good! Mega churches should have to help out on the goodness

Btc just had to scare off the fresh meat, can't handle newbies making money
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:12:23
This is a nice community where you guys actually provide answers instead of implying someone should already know
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:00:16
See, that wasnt my question. I was more curious about compensation for miners. I didn't realize tx fees amounted
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:21:50
Hit me with the bad news doc
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:00:30
