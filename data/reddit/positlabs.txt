Easiest way to increase traffic is to give away free bitcoin. It doesn't need to be much.

THANK YOU! I felt the same way.

Have you looked into Anoncoin? I don't know much about it, but if you're being private for good reason, then it might be worth looking into.
Otherwise, if you're being private just for privacy sake, I suppose you could learn to write some code. blockchain.info has an awesome api. You would just need to know the rules for determining taint levels.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:56:16
No. Most people use it for gambling.

There was an exploit used on coinbase to get these emails. Totally unrelated to gox.

I couldn't get this script to work. Seemed like it was 99% of the way there, but I couldn't find the point of failure.
Tried this set of instructions and they worked like a charm.

Haha that's what i get for reading headlines
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:02:46
I got a few of these. They were part of the big attack that happened after mtgox made the announcement about transaction malleability. I think they were meant to slow down transaction processing times so the attackers could take advantage of the malleability issue. I don't think any others had the same issue as gox tho.

Kind of off-topic, but the government hires the lowest bidder to make websites. That's why the quality is so low.

No computer is needed to run Prospero x3. They are standalone units

Probably not this particular ruling, but there's no way that bitcoin transactions won't be taxed. I think major pressure will be put on merchants and exchanges if bitcoin becomes mainstream.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:55:35
Since all BLTCoin derivatives are consumable coins, I don't think there should be a limit.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:39:02
Haha... did you not read the announcements?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:36:39
Kerpeles is not MtGox, btw.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:49:23
BLTCoins have an expiration date. If they can be traded so quickly as to run out of bacon, then I would be surprised.
And, related...
It's been proposed that the age of a coin could be used to determine its standing in the transaction queue. Same goes for sandwiches. Older sandwiches will get priority in the queue.

Isn't this already the unofficial slogan? Anyway, it's perfect.

It's crazy easy to run nodes on Amazon ec2 instances. And once you have the full blockchain, you can duplicate it and spawn more nodes. It's not free though, so I think only people with vested interest would do this
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:25:14
Why is it capped at 8 passive outbound connections if certain ports are closed? Is that the only case where a connection is uni directional? 
Edit... I guess that could just be the default cap for outbound connections
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:34:28
I'm still having this problem! WTF?
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:55:52
ASIC is useless for folding. Curecoin uses ASIC mining to generate coins that serve as an incentive to fold.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:56:30
Oh, maybe I'll increase that. It's taken a couple of weeks to get this many connections.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:24:33
If you're in for a long term investment, buying at market rate is a perfectly fine strategy.
Also, you can set up a recurring buy on coinbase. I haven't tried setting it up, but I imagine you can set it to buy $100 worth of btc once a week.
At the same time, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

Not quite the same experience. Vircurex was way more transparent in what they were doing, and they're already back online.
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:55:17
Right. It's a powerful tool, but most people don't know how to create an EC2 instance, ssh into it, install the bitcoind cli, etc. Barrier to entry is too high. I think setting up an EC2 instance might be frustrating enough to make the layman say 'fuck it', and give up.
There might be services that do this, but it would be better to have a one-click bitcoin node spawner. I know EC2 has instance templates, but is it possible to share those with others? Maybe I'll look into this...
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:40:16
Yes, I also hold BaconCoin. It relies on and supports BLTCoin.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:13:13
Ooooo! This would actually work. Not super accurate, but I think it would do for tax purposes.
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:53:11
That's almost correct. Mining is done with sha-256 mining hardware, and rewards are 55%. The other 45% goes to folders. The idea is that by using sha-256 (asic, same as bitcoin), it will allow for GPUs to focus on folding.

I don't know why everyone is insisting that this statement says gox is dead. It's just an official statement about gox in general. It was made because gox is setting a bad example, and people are losing faith in the exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:53:36
Search 'trezor'.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:43:36
Tell that to auto correct. It's always splitting "bitcoin" into "bit coin"
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:10:08
"...to be reported in some way."
Um... the blockchain does that, I'm pretty sure. Not sure how much of a burden that creates. 
The tax IS a burden, though. Can't say I'm not surprised about the ruling, though.

Looks good at a glance, but can you give a tl;dr?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:17:25
Google transaction malleability.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:07:55
Possibly, but if they can let everyone cash out by doing it, then it's fine with me.

You can run a node on Amazon servers. It's crazy cheap. I did this because I didn't want to lag my house. 
Downside is that it's mostly done on the command line

Please explain how this is more restrictive than current licensing practices...
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:49:05
Maybe it isn't another discussion. Why exactly are you against licensing? Is it because it restricts usage to one person? Colored coins would make it super easy to lend licenses to friends.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:18:14
What? Gambling with something disqualifies it from currency-hood? Just the fact that people are using it as currency makes it a currency.
People are using it for gambling in particular because it serves as a loophole for the current laws against gambling online.

Sandwiches can be "mined" by sandwich artists. It works like a mint, but it is distributed, and anyone can do it.

Bah. I can't find the post. Somebody made a post on reddit that explained the exploit.

Did the gox transaction api reveal anything that the blockchain doesn't?
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:49:25
Yeah it would be awful nice if they changed it back. Unfortunately I don't know who did it , so I can't ask the directly

Right. So all of the other exchanges are working WITH gox?
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:11:54
It would have to be an exchange site that also serves as a wallet... barring no deposits from other sources

The following question isn't related to the new tax policy, but this post made me think of it. 
I paid for $10k in mining equipment last year, but I haven't made any profit on it yet because it hasn't shipped. How does this relate to my taxes for last year? I've never made any large investments before, so I'm not sure what to do with those numbers
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:23:51
