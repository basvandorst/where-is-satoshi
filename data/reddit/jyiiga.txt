Yes, but it would destroy its greater value and potential. Imagine if everything cryotocoin evaporated from all the app stores, ATMs were removed, countries declared it illegal. Those sort of things could easily put it into a downward spiral.
Hopefully it never happens.

Not that I can tell. I've already jumped through all of the available limit increases.

I believe the weekly limit on coinbase is 15k.

I know everyone likes to mock these individuals that are in a position of power, but lets consider a hypothetical (though improbable scenario). 
If some of the larger governments around the world had a meeting specifically on crypto and decided they wanted to control or end its use. You could not stop them. 
I hope the revolution keeps chugging along at its current pace, but the faint possibility of implosion is always in the back of my mind.

With the right infrastructure in place, they can clamp down on it. China is toying with a blanket block. 
"The Chinese authorities may be moving toward a broad clampdown on Bitcoin, including peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) trading platforms. Using the Great Firewall to block IP addresses, access to foreign bitcoin exchanges could be blocked and the Bitcoin transaction network could be disrupted within the country. Bitcoin miners are also worried that their operations could be restricted."

The sad truth is, the moment your average user sees .io they become wary.

Well you can at least say you were part of this revolution. Thats about it though.

This is why they are working on things like BTC to LTC lightening network.

When this stuff ends up on the first page of all. It really goes to demonstrate how ignorant most people are on the entire subject. What a damn mess these comments are. o.o

People have been predicting the downfall of it from inception. Yet its churned out hundreds millionaires in a few short years. Sucks missing the ride huh?

Its pretty damn fun watching the live charts. I just watched it hit 9k and then surge back up to 9400 in seconds.

Pretty huge investment to mine bitcoin these days. Though you could probably mine some alt coins. Better off just investing if you are interested.

You are not going to lose 100 dollars. However, its also not going to be seeing 100k. Some 2020 projections have it at 20k. 
However, that basically just it doubling at this point (which is great). So you would turn 100 dollars into 200 dollars. You gotta have money to make money. Never invest more than you are willing to lose.
