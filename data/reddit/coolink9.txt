So here's what happened.... I got a transfer from someone approximately 21 hours before my coins was hacked. I was using my Bitpay wallet and I restored a previous wallet using my pneumonic recovery phrase. Newly generated address was used the only thing that wasn't new was my wallet itself as I restored if obviously. What do u guys speculate happened? So here's a piece of information. The device I am using is a rooted Nexus 5x, the only possible thing I can think of is somehow this guy either had an Android rat installed on my device but again idk how that's possible I'm not a total noog when it comes to security and downloading things installing programs that I can't say are legit and not infected with malware. However, one thing I did realize, is on one of my back up cloud drives I have a picture of my pneumonic recovery phrase. Even if someone has that phrase, I haven't had any coins in my wallet for Months! I've never had anything like this happen before. Even if they did get it because they got ahold of my recovery phrase, I still had a password on my wallet but I guess that doesn't matter once they got my recovery phrase right? But the next question. Even if they got all this information, how could they possibly have caught notice of coins being deposited into my wallet when they weren't there for even a whole day? I'd get it if it was a few days or weeks. But not even 24 hours passed by and they knew I have coins in my wallet!? 
Whoever this was, they are sophisticated in their hacking and I strongly advise you all to be more careful securing ur wallets. This guy must have bots and scripts in place that automatically monitor the balances on his victims wallets and constantly running recovery phrases etc. To see if they received any new transactions
