yes, but i must be forgetful, what stocks are LISTED on etrade?
oh that's right, they are not an exchange, they are simply a broker who has an account at an exchange, for which they paid probably millions of dollars for. 
Exchange vs Broker...look it up

Also, in case anyone was wondering, a seat on NYSE costs upward of $3 million USD. You know, if you feel like doing a couple hundred dollars in trading you should totally get a seat on the exchange :-|
MPEX positioned itself as the largest and best exchange in the bitcoin economy. The 30btc fee gives you quick executions, access to liquidity, and low rates. The interface is for people who will program up a system to use it. 
So if you think MPEX is trying to be the "eTrade" of bitcoin economy, you are wrong. There are brokers who do that already, they hold the seats on the MPEX, and you go through brokers and pay their fees. This stuff is really obvious, btw. 
tl;dr If you plan on making a living, or "brokering" deals for others, MPEX is for you, if not...i recommend CoinBR

not if that company promised to always release 100% of its net profits as dividend...
have you read the IPO agreement? I would say staying true to your word in the world of bitcoin is probably way better than changing things as you feel like it. 
ALSO, he is not issuing any NEW shares, these are the same shares that he issued originally. He only OFFERED 10,000,000 at that time or 10% of the company. He is simply offering out 5% more. 
I don't know him personally, but it seems like he is doing everything extremely transparently, and honoring his agreement as listed on mpex.

I actually spent the morning emailing this guy back and forth. He's a nice guy, and I answered some of his questions. Being combative with people who disagree with you rarely brings them to your side. 
This is very new, give people time to learn about this and they will eventually use it anyway.

again, i am going to try and explain this...
if you want to buy and sell stocks, you could do this a couple of ways. You could get a seat at an exchange, for stocks that would be NYSE or NASDAQ, the cost is around 3-4 Million dollars.
The other option, is to go to a broker who has purchased said seat from the exchange, and they will act on your behalf to send your orders and deliver your stock...that is the way the CURRENT financial system works.
tl;dr you are trying to buy a seat on the exchange when you really wanted an ETrade account...

Sounds cool, is the product mainly the platform? In other words, is this like think or swim but for bitcoins? Or are you guys going to have an exchange part of it as well?

Seriously, this makes a ton of sense. If he wants to expand and be able to take more bets for higher amounts, he will need to get more capital. 
Someone was talking about 7 days of operating cost. He gives away all the profits as dividends. So he is staying true to his word, and not using the profits to build up more funds, but rather, issuing more shares.
Some people act like a stock that pays out 70% yield (at last IPO price) on dividends should act like a growth stock...riiiiiiight.
TL;DR He isn't using profits to grow, because he gives them out as dividends, so he is issuing shares so he can expand.

I monitor all the charts, and this sub a lot, I was checking CNBC randomly, and thought I was in the wrong app. 
Cuz a million dollars isn't cool anymore...you know what's cool? A billion dollars...

the best way is to buy puts (or sell calls) using MPEX, you can use coinbr.com as a broker if you don't want to directly deal with mpex, as it's user interface is difficult and it's fees to register are high.
So far as I know, that is the only way to take a "short" position in bitcoin aside from selling bitcoins and holding cash.

I personally think that one of the biggest factors was Coinbase.com
They are now doing $1 million dollars a month in bitcoin. They offer a simple, easy and understandable way to get into bitcoins, so I think that has helped demand. I personally venture to say that as they restricted sales due to volume, they may have caused the slight dip. Pure speculation of course.

Android already has a virtual currency that can do so much more...

I think a local store which was willing to act as an exchange would be awesome. You could get a lot of business from people who don't want to wait for banks to clear
