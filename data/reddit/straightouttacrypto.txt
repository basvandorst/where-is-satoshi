My opinion is that the only reason Bitmain's ABC fork (with then became "BCH / Bitcoin Cash") got so much traction and is creating so much confusion is because of the gigantic segwit2x fiasco.
Many Bitcoin actors committed to segwit2x to then retract as soon as segwit was locked in (and some warned that it would happen). And so segwit happened, but 2x didn't. And that's when some big players joined force with Bitmain's fork.
Not commenting on Satoshi's original code's comments mentioning bigger blocks and not discussing if 2x bigger blocks would have meant that no node could process the Bitcoin blockchain today, the fact is: it's people committing to segwit2x to then retract once segwit was locked in who created their archnemesis.

It's amazing how people continue to be imprecise and perpetuate bogus numbers. A BIP-39 24 words seed is 256 bits.  It's 2 exp 256, no 2048 exp 24.  It still huge, but being precise and correct is important. It's 24 words times 11 bits (2048 is 2 exp 11), which gives 264 bits. Out of these 264 bits 8 bits are used for the BIP-39 checksum (the checksum is 8 bits when there are 256 bits / 24 words).
Believe me I know how it works: I had to write a cracker for my own very first BIP-39 seed for which I simply forgot to write a word down (I had 23 instead of 24 words). Lesson learned.

I'm talking about segwit2x, getting BOTH segwit and, well, 2x.   2x just like the comment by Satoshi in the original codebase said should be done as some point in the future.
I have nothing against segwit. What I don't like is that many agreed on segwit2x, fully knowing they'd withdrew as soon as segwit was locked in. This was anticipated, this is what happened.
People who agreed on segwit2x then pulled out once segwit was locked in are precisely the reason many early users, like me, were very disappointed.  Quite some went as far as considering the "2x but no segwit" chain was the "true" Bitcoin.
This whole fiasco could have been avoided.

I don't disagree with that but the whole shitshow could have been avoided, and I hope mods here won't ban me for stating a fact, if company who had vowed to switch to segwit2x didn't, as expected, pull back once segwit was locked in.
All these people openly lied to get segwit locked then pulled back from 2x.
Without that move Jihan would have been alone with his ASIC boost ABC chain.
It's pulling out of 2x once segwit was locked in that created a sizeable exodus from early Bitcoin adopters to what became Bitcoin Cash.
I wish talking about that total dick move was allowed here and not insta-banned by mods.
It was a bad move and it created the mess we're still in, so there are lessons to be taken.

First let me say I believe in BTC, not BCH/BSV/ETH.


So a key principle is that nobody controls bitcoin and segwit got added "without anyone controlling bitcoin", but that segwit2x didn't get added because "nobody is controlling bitcoin".
How's that not double-standard?
To get enough to vote for segwit, segwit2x was promised, then as soon as segwit was locked in bigger blocks (clearly panned in the original codebase by Satoshi) disappeared.


Early adopters, individuals like me who have both read the whitepaper and looked at the original sourcecode and who have ran or are running full nodes and who know 2x bigger blocks wouldn't have created any problem whatsoever.

People in other subs do exactly what they please. Also sadly some people who have now totally left cryptocurrencies (no matter which one) helped create this situation.

\&gt; Bitcoin is self-defeating as a currency when it can gain 40% in 2 weeks.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin. 40% gain in 2 weeks, 80% loss. Whatever. That's how it is and it's a very good thing. If you want a stable coin, than you can buy USDC. At this point you can even not bother with crypto at all for that matters.
Then what you see as scam coins have sometimes behind them very early adopters who feel they've been completely betrayed.
Is ETH a scam tech? What about ZK proofs as in ZCash? XTZ?
Everything but BTC is a scam coin to you?

I think technically not a longest-chain but a "chain with the most PoW" (which happens to also be the longest)...
If I understood properly CW+Ayre are planning to split their mining power between the BCH/SV (to protect their fork from 51% attack at least a bit) and the BCH/ABC fork (on the latter they'd only mine empty blocks and be rewriting history for a few blocks, with empty blocks... Until BCH/ABC dies). That's their plan as I understand it.
They could get additionally tricky and do tx censorship on the BCH/SV chain from tx coming from addresses they know belong to Roger Ver / Jihan Wu.
Now it shall require quite some mining power to both 51% attack BCH/ABC (Jihan Wu as quite the mining power too) AND still protect BCH/SV from 51% attacks.
So I think what GP is saying is that if BCH/SV manages to 51% attack BCH/ABC nobody shall be paid anything in BCH/ABC anymore.

I don't know: I think something like 50 plus currencies experienced hyperinflation during the last 100 years. Nothing to sneeze at.


Are you pretending to not understand? If the inflation is fixed by something (like amount of physical gold that is found and extracted yearly or an inflation curve set in stone in source code), then the government cannot confiscate people's savings through inflation. And hence it cannot snowball into hyperinflation.
When I see the amount of QE that went on, I think it's legitimate to doubt the state's ability to not screw things up. But ofc for state-loving socialists, the ability of the state to confiscate people's savings through inflation is the best thing since sliced bread.


Oh yeah I forgot everybody here got in during the peak, putting all their savings into BTC, and are hence ruined.

Shorting worked so far for basically anyone who shorted in the last year. It's non-stop bear market. And bears made money.
I managed to trade well and end up with more coins, but I've got "more coins worth less".
So congrats to all those who shorted during this last year.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:27:32
Some smart people are going to buy more at a price much lower than what they sold for (I remember someone getting flamed here on Reddit for saying he was selling all his ETH above 1000 USD) and some ppl are certainly going to close big shorts.
However I don't think all those who got burned since one year are going to buy back anytime soon. I guess for them it's "lesson learned" (that's how they'll see it) and they'll never come back to crypto.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:30:22
\&gt; When the prices drop, who exactly are the coins being sold to?
To people who believe price is going to go up and who either go long or close shorts (or both if they reverse their short position).
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:31:58
Sure but a lot of the buyers are shorters closing their shorts. So these coins were lent and once the shorters close their short, they end up in the end, for example, of people who saw their coins go from 6200 to 4300 USD in a few days. Some of them are going to panic and put more downward pressure.
Also you do realize that one of the reason price is falling so fast is because the order books are so thin? There are hardly any buyers.

I'm a software dev and I'm in crypto since 2013: but not as a crypto software dev (except for my own, user non friendly, crypto related tools and utilities I wrote for my own use).
I 100% agree with what you wrote. I think the subset of software devs good at UI/UX and who can understand how crypto works and write safe and secure software is sadly abysmally small.
Not much changed since 2013.

What could happen is a MITM (man in the middle) attack where the destination address is changed. It could changed on your screen or on the way to the hardware device or in the email you received. If your computer or anything in the chain is compromised, bad things could happen. There are even copy/paste malware in the wild which changed Bitcoin address when it'd recognize one in the clipboard.
HOWEVER good hardware wallets do show the address you're going to send to on the hardware wallet itself. So if you're cautious you can detect such attacks. I "whitelist" known good address in a physical notebook (an actual book where I take notes, not a computer "notebook"). And I always double-check that the address I'm sending and which appears on the hardware wallet is actually one of the address whitelisted on my notebook. At least for tx above a certain amount.
So: steal private keys, no. Trick you into sending to an address which you didn't intend to: definitely doable.

\&gt; Funny, my rent is in USD and it's the same every month!
Was the same for people in Venezuela. Until it wasn't.
\&gt; If I paid my rent in bitcoin, it would cost me 3x as much as it did in January.
If I bought my house today in Bitcoin, it would cost me 3x as much BTC as it did in January. However it'd still cost me 20x less BTC than when I bought them in 2013.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:16:51
I'm in it since 2012 and I do panic. This is a huge crash. I don't see any sign of any buyer anywhere. Order books are ultra thin on every single exchange. People who've been burnt during the last years aren't going back to crypto anytime soon.
I'm not selling anything though: I sold enough near 14 K USD to never be forced to work if I don't want to again but I'm still very concerned for Bitcoin and crypto in general.
It's as if the interest is dying.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:38:53
I'm not making FUD up. I bought BTC at about 200 USD and then I bought ETH at the very beginning, which I sold near the peak (in BTC). So when the run up to nearly 19 K USD happened, I was "crypto rich", which I never really was before.
Which may be why now I'm concerned. I'm still HODLing the coins I have and it's still a lot. However I'm very happy that I sold quite some near 14 K. Hindsight is 10/10 but it was a big mistake to not sell more.

Nobody can generate all your public keys from some of your public keys.
However AFAIR one private key leaked and the master public key and all the private keys can be generated. Don't know if it works the other way: if you've got the master private key and one public key, can you generate all public keys? I guess you can. Don't know why you'd ever want to generate more public keys from an old seed out of which you lost the master public key (modern seeds allow to derive both the public and private keys and you cannot lose your master public key).

Because the 4 last time I wasn't crypto rich. So I didn't give a shit. At least I think that's why : - /

Lol. It's sunny here today (Spain) and I can buy Bitcoin on GDAX/Coinbase, on Bitstamp, on Kraken and on several other exchanges.
I'm not so sure people are lining up to buy something that lost 80% of its value in 10 months.
Once again: I'm HODLing those I have left.

What a load of FUD. If anything Bitcoin is much much much more accepted than before. It's way easier to buy with USD / EUR then it used to.

That is already what is happening. Some are not selling, no matter the price. The question is not who are the buyers but who are the sellers.
The sellers are the miners. And in less than a year the daily supply is going to be slashed in half.
