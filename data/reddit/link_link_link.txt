Much appreciated buddy

thanks for the info! Unfortunately it says that there's been 88 confirmations... Do you still think it may show up eventually?

Ok so I have the official Bitcoin app with two wallets: One BCH and one BTC. When I created a backup for both wallets, I found that they shared the exact same private key. 
This morning I bought a small amount of BTC though coinbase and immediately (stupidly) transferred it to my BCH wallet (In the official bitcoin app) thinking that it was the BTC wallet. The transaction shows as "compete" in coinbase, but obviously the BCH balance is still 0. Any help would be much appreciated!

Holy shit man! I got it! Thanks again, I'm glad I didn't listen to that douche Riz haha.

Shit, well I'm a noob. Thought I would give it a shot, but apparently I have a lot to learn. Damnit

I assume that means i'm fucked?

Transaction was about 12hrs ago. Yes I'm using the bitcoin.com app. If tap "receive" and toggle between BTC and BCH, the addresses are different, but I've definitely been messing with it like crazy and likely tapped "generate new address" at some point. And yes, I can see the address I sent the BTC to when I log into coinbase. I really appreciate your help man!

damnnnnn! That seemed so promising! I definitely thought it was going to work. Unfortunately, when I scan the addresses for funds, it says "could not update transaction history." Could this be because of high stress on the servers?
