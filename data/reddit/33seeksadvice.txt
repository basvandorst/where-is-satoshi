I'm sorry about your situation. Ransomeware is becoming a pretty popular thing now. I had a meeting earlier this week to see what we can do to limit the rick of being exposed to it as well as our recovery process. 
As far as buying bitcoin, you can try Coinbase. They're frustrating, slow to respond, and always have some sort of issue going on. But its the most convenient way that i know of. You can also try LocalBitcoins.com. they tend to be higher priced, but are almost instant.
Would you mind sharing the email? Im really curious.

Coinbase is legit. Just very poorly run. I have to contact them every few weeks to have them review my account because for UNK reasons, they keep suspending my ability to buy and randomly lower my limits. Its one or the other. On top of that, they take forever to respond. Its pretty frustrating and inconvenient at times. But, when it works, its great.

I think these guys do custom commercial applications

Sounds about right. First response will be generic and usless.

A week or two. And then its usually something generic that doesnt apply to your issue. So you'd have to send a second email that will take about another 2 weeks.
