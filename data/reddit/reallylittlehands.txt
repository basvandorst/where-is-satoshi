No, it just keeps on inflating, I took this number from the public information available on the blockchain.

Sounds like the answer you give when you don’t know how to answer what I’ve said. 
There’s a reason bitcoin’s market dominance is fading.

People need to stop blindly following a bitcoin salesman. Reddit is great at catching out bullshit, which is why it is being shamed by the bitcoin religion at the moment.

Yeah you’re right... good luck

THESE ARE NOT OPINIONS THEY ARE FACTS... 
An average transaction fee of $164 is not an opinion. It’s written on the blockchain
Bitcoin’s dominance has dropped to 43.8%, more money is invested in Altcoins than bitcoin now 
The mempool has 105,000 unconfirmed transactions and bitcoin can only confirm 6 per second.
MAYBE IF YOU LOOKED OUTSIDE OF THE MASSIVE CIRCLE JERK THAT IS R/BITCOIN YOU’D SEE WHAT’S GOING ON

Bitcoin’s competition is Gold, Silver and Oil... except Bitcoin isn’t nice to look at or useable in anyway.

I literally got nothing from that... 
The problem is the $160 average transaction fees and the 100,000 mempool... this isn’t bullshit, it is a fact.. if bitcoin fixes those problems then great but at the moment it is useless as a currency and I’m not sitting around hoping that someone fixes it. Instead I’ll come back if it is fixed! Useless an alt coin fixes it first.
