I don't use Coinbase. I sell via Bittylicious or localbitcoins. Never had any issues.

This is a possibility. There are murmurs already of how much energy is consumed by the mining process. The powers that be don't need to try and stop bitcoin from a technical standpoint; there are endless subversive techniques they can use.

Somebody do something!

We're still fighting against the criminal banking system - it's just disguised under "scaling issues", BCH and endless in-fighting. It's much more dangerous now as the enemy has realized the way to destroy Bitcoin is from within.

You could say that about stocks, ETFs, derivatives, etc. Most people's investment interests are limited to high interest savings accounts and property.
My point was bitcoin is popular enough now that any wildly ridiculous gains, like putting in X and it being worth 100x in a few years is gone. 
People still might make tons off bitcoin or crypto, but it won't be without risking serious capital of their own. The people who made made huge amounts of money off tiny investments are those who got in when the whole thing was under the radar.

The time for making enormous amounts of money on Bitcoin is gone; frankly, I'd say it's gone for cryptocurrency as a whole. It's too widely known now, the average guy knows about it and could buy it if he wanted, the "man" certainly knows about it, which always means the average Joe isn't going to be allowed to win big on it.
You may make steady profit over the long term, but those huge headline figures are gone. You need to keep your ear to the ground and try and spot the next big thing. By the time the average Joe heard about bitcoin the game was already over.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:22:56
That's what I thought it was. I'm at work so I saw it and scrolled quickly down.

No, it's not good at all. The system has won. They failed to take over BTC, so they just created their own BCH with a bunch of centralized miners. Just wait for the endless FUD against BTC, forcing maybe a "legacy" moniker to existing BTC, their illumanti friends will get some big retailer like Amazon to accept BCH over BTC for payments and boom.

We've seen a bubble like this before. Not buying until it inevitably crashes to $2000 again.
Wish Ethereum would pick back up :-( Bought a lot of that in the last bubble when it was damn near 400 bucks a coin... fail.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:28:29
Celebrities are just the interface between the system and the brain-dead average person on the street, so she has absolutely been brought on to spread FUD about bitcoin and crypto in general as and when required. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:42:34
$3750 - IT'S JUST NOT GONNA STOP.
Are we gonna be ok guys?!
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:48:45
You call my post ludicrous for speculating one way and then proceed to drown me in your own speculation. 
My concern sometimes is the cult-like mentality over any criticism of bitcoin. Anyway, nobody knows categorically how it's going to play out, but it's certainly going to be interesting to watch.
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:53:48
Good job man. Didn't know that. Glad you stopped by.
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:28:02
See Illuminati will all surround BCH and make sure it survives.
This is the system distributing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:53:36
Ethereum has a plethora of potential applications and real companies out there employing Solidity developers. It's here to stay.

Ledger put out a step by step guide on how to do it. See here: 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:30:14
BTC is Bitcoin. BCH is an altcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is some straight up garbage. Everyone knows it. It's heart warming to see bitcoin fighting off these attacks and remaining true to its core philosophy. To the moon!!!
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:48:13
By storing them in your own wallet - be it a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor; a software wallet like Electrum, Exodus, etc; a paper wallet or brain wallet.
In all of the above cases you control your private keys. If they're held in "your" wallet on the exchanges, you're relying on their security measures.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:10:51
Holding bitcoins in coinbase is buying crypto. And no intent on my part to sound aggressive, sorry.
The easiest way is to use a software wallet that is installed on your PC, laptop or phone. Electrum and Exodus are both highly rated wallets for bitcoin (although the latter also stores numerous altcoins too).
You then just send the coins from your coinbase wallet to the receiving address of the software wallet on your PC, laptop or phone.

Reminds me of:
"Never make decisions when you're angry"
"Never make promises when you're happy"
It's always stuck with me.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:32:16
That's your public key presumably?
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:51:22
A wallet (hardware, software, paper, brain). How can people be buying crypto and not heard of wallets?
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:56:14
Thanks. I did read this and I have installed the Bitcoin Cash app. When I open it, it looks identical to the bitcoin app and even shows "BTC" as the balance, rather than BCH. Is this the correct behavior?
Also, with regards to sending coins to addresses on their respective chains to ensure proper splitting, they said they're going to release a tool for this. Can't see anything like that on their website and time is kinda getting on now....
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:46:35
In your own wallet - software, hardware, paper, whatever. Do you research and choose the method that most suits you. In all cases, though, ensure you're responsible for your private keys, not anyone else.

It's a running joke from a bitcoin forum a long time ago when someone misspelled "hold". 
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:18:08
Wrong. The site goes down like clockwork every time there is a crash.

wot u lookin at m8? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:25:57
So, your wallet address is not your public key? If not, can you explain the difference?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:46:23
It's absurd to think people are going to be selling their BTC at the exchange rate.
End-to-end, from your fiat bank account to BTC wallet, localbitcoins still has some of the best rates around.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:53:25
They have £200 of my money too. Pricks just took it and didn't bother giving me the coins. No response from support. Outrageous.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:05:25
Ok, will do. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:08:48
Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but as long as you have your coins in a wallet that supports UASF you'll be safe. Trezor, electrum, samurai and ledger all support UASF to my knowledge.
