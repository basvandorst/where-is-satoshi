No. Yes, many. Yes. The entire Chicago/monetarist/Keynesian school is grossly incorrect. As a concrete example, and even most Austrians overlook this, government spending is figured into GDP with a coefficient of 1. That coefficient should be much lower than 1, usually more like 0, and in the case of an imperial contraption like the United States more like -1. Is that gross enough for you?

Jon Matonis wrote a bit about them when he blogged for Forbes.
Basically, they are centralized mixers requiring that users trust the operator (me). bitcoinlaundry.com allows for an arbitrary number of transactions in, to a single address, and only one transaction out to a single address, sent after 10 confirmations of the full amount specified on scheme creation. bitlaundry.com provides a single input address and up to 10 output addresses. Output transactions can be scheduled (pseudo-randomly) to occur over up to 10 days and with a maximum of 10 transactions per day.
bitcoinlaundry.com charges a flat fee based on the scheme value. bitlaundry.com charges that plus a per-transaction fee.

Indeed. If the Gox balance sheet is really like what was shown in the purportedly leaked document, a lot of people are losing a lot of money.
If this turns into a bankruptcy proceeding and Japanese law works anything like what I'm familiar with, depositors with fiat and/or BTC on the exchange are going to be low in the pecking order for getting reimbursed out of the bankruptcy estate. Shareholders would be paid dead last, and I believe unsecured creditors before them. But before customers get anything back at all, it's going to be legal, accounting and audit fees, employee wages and benefits, secured bondholders, fines, taxes due, and on and on.
Assuming Gox ever gets the $5.5M back from the US FedGov, US$ depositors are going to get a *maximum* of $0.41 per dollar owing, and that is *before* even taking the nearly 750,000 BTC owing into account. If you value those at $500 each, it's a *maximum* of seven-and-a-half cents per dollar owing.

Every so often, when B-Millions isn't mixing his dance choons together, he drops two-second-long bursts of noise into the mix from an unlabeled record he handles with delicate precision. Some in the crowd check their phones after these bursts occur, and smiles can be seen in the glow of smartphone screens.
Because B-Millions isn't just a DJ. He's also giving back to his listeners, tipping fractions of Bitcoins back to fans who bought their event tickets online, early. He's also a node in a growing network of covert transaction distribution, paid not only for spinning his tracks but also for relaying Bitcoin transactions to his listeners. Their smartphone apps hear the Bitcoin transaction data in the noise and pass it on to the rest of the network, while occasionally rewarding their owners.

Long-term, no "sovereign government" (a hobgoblin used to scare the children into obedience, really) has this power. Bitcoin needs lobbyists like a fish needs a bicycle, and I see a group I once supported eagerly working to get fish riding bikes. Also, sending Bitcoin to DC is like sending My Little Pony to the veterinarian -- except that the vet will actually try to help.
No, the lobbyist bit is not "the" reason, only the straw that broke the back of my rage camel at the way some things Bitcoin have been going lately at policy-making level, such as using Github as a platform to purge "radicals" from the bitcoin.org press center page; pushing "quick and easy" (but actually major) changes (e.g. the dust spam reduction patch) through with absolutely no community consensus; and then attempts to browbeat objectors into submission by screaming such rubbish as "get your politics off github!" as well as using geek conversation domination strategies to shut down and marginalize outside input. Add to all that the inexcusable sins for any non-profit board member pointed to at  and I think reasonable people can see that this is about far more than one issue, and that your accusations of personal vendetta are ill-founded at best.
The "we, who?" question is intended to illuminate a major difference of opinion and to challenge to thought-blocking use of "we" to shut down discussion -- all the way up to the level of creating an unbridgeable gap between positions, a schism. On this issue, I am an unabashed schismatic.
So, in the interests of that, fuck you very much, I DO live in your vaunted "real world" and fuck you as well for attempting to slip another ad hominem under folks' mental radar via an underhanded attempt to claim consensus and brand me as insane in the process. Fuck you also for saying "no offense" and then, essentially, "you're an idiot" in the same sentence. Finally, fuck you for having the audacity -- and by "audacity" I mean "hubris, overweening pride" -- for calling me "Pops".

@_date: 2013-04-20 19:30:26
Very poor reasoning, IMHO, from the school of Keynes.
In a naive model over a short period of time we can assume that the amount of all human wealth on earth is essentially static. Where that wealth is held in inflationary monetary instruments (fiat currencies), expansion of the money supply (which sounds so professional and neutral) equates directly to reducing the current value of all people with savings in the currency and arrogating that stolen wealth to the money suppliers and their cronies.

Hi. I'm the author of the article at nostate.com.
"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him" is an ancient teaching from Zen Buddhism. Like most things written in and through and about Zen, it can be interpreted in many ways. In my post, I use it in the following sense:
In Zen, seekers after enlightenment (true knowledge) are presented, many times, with leaps of insight accompanied by degrees of spiritual awakening. The stories are many of students, perceiving a truth or emerging from meditation, running excitedly to their gurus, exclaiming "I see! I get it!". The roshi's (guru's) response often looks very odd: "great, now do the dishes", or the roshi may even strike the seeker, up the the point of breaking one of his limbs. The point here is that, having achieved some mastery over the subject/object distinction, having seen beyond the Veil of Maya, the seeker has immediately collapsed back into error by his exclamation.
Likewise, there is a tendency among seekers to perceive the divine in their teachers, whether roshi or random strangers, and then fall immediately into the error of venerating the teacher instead of understanding that, as Tolstoy titled his book, "the kingdom of God is within you". Thus, if the seeker meets someone while he is on the path (road) to enlightenment who he identifies as a being greater than himself, a Buddha, he should kill that being -- meaning not to actually murder anyone, but to recognize the impuse toward erroneous veneration, acknowledge it, grin at it, and let that misidentification slide on by, taking away a lesson in the process.
That may not explain, exactly, the title under which the OP shared my post, but, I pray, may point you in the right direction.

Some client code (including my outdated bitcoin-php library) naively assumes that all Bitcoin addresses start with a "1". I think the only reason I learned that multisig addresses start with a "3" is because Vitalik Buterin was sleeping in my kitchen for a few days.

Aw, shucks! :-)

Have I expressed my love for you lately, FT?

Amen to that!

I've never been Satoshi Nakamoto either!

Early and somewhat regretful life member here. My confidence in the foundation is exactly equal to my confidence in Jon Matonis, which is extremely high. Unfortunately, Jon is only one vote on the board, and my opinions on the rest range from neutral to unmentionable.

Waste of energy. As far as I can tell, and as far as I am advocating, the Foundation is unsalvageably corrupt in its current incarnation, and shouldn't be trusted with a toothpick, let alone with facilitating a conversation aimed as its dissolution.

The reasons run FAR deeper than just this (serious, to me) issue. Conflicts of interest and conflicts of litigation among board members? Foundation hiring Coinlab's own general counsel? This kind of stuff is inexcusably improper for any non-profit organization.

Sometimes my witticisms are too dense. Ver was convicted of shipping explosives to ebay buyers. Nobody was harmed. Thus, a punishment for violating official /diktat/ absent any real damage.
Of course, such opinions make me an extremist.

Fair enough, but some folks do need to hear that, at the very least.

The Bitcoin donation option remains open at my site, 
Between me, the family and the lawyer, we haven't figured out yet how to go about spending the BTC collected there, so we're maintaining parallel efforts for the moment.

I think that Ross will have any remaining assets frozen as proceeds of "crimes" and eventually taken by the US fucking government. This will include the storage media containing his private keys.  He is very likely to need financial help to pay for counsel unless he's already sitting on a nice pile of money that he can demonstrate comes from "legitimate" sources.
