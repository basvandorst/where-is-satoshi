No, that's not how it works. He couldn't have bought anything with no funds at Coinbase.

This is the third crash. Third! Stop those drugs, boy.

"Usually comes up" is on very different scale than the earth rotates each day. And what the fuck is a "self evident nature of truth of what goes down , usually comes up."? I throw a stone, and it stays very naturally and self evident down.

If this is your reasoning, then you should be very aware that there is an upper bound. This time (around end of the year during its ATH) the parents of my wife randomly brought the topic bitcoin up. I was very surprised by that audience. I fail to imagine who else is left for a next bubble.

Comparing the predictability of earth rotating around ~~the sun~~ its axis, which was done more than a billion of times with an assumed crash bubble cycle of bitcoin, by THREE observations is not something a sane person would do.

I read this not the first time. This is a very weak argument, as it is also very impossible for every millionaire in the world to own one kilogramm of my shit. Now you do the maths.

Thanks for this enlightening lecture. I would have really enjoyed to read your break down, because from my point of view OP showed with their comparison a delusional perception of their abilty to predict the future of the bitcoin rate. But surely I missed some context and self evident nature truth to understand its validy.


Sadly, I don't.

Sure, that's a possibilty. I am just pointing out that at some time that is no more possible. And my few observations from elder people talking about Bitcoin is in no way representative, but it indicates to me that I can't exclude the other possibility, i.e. Bitcoin peaked for its last time.
