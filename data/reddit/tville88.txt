As someone who doesn't understand bitcoin this all makes me very sad. I started looking into bitcoin when it was about $1,700. I know it's about doubled since, but I don't get the first thing about it.

What's an alternative you all would suggest? I downloaded coinbase last week and was just thinking of investing for the first time in it.

I'm new to all of this, but how do I invest in bitcash? I downloaded coinbase, and made an account, but I'm a little unsure what to do next.

What the hell are you talking about? Is this how you mine bitcoin? I have followed along with bitcoin for over a year, but as a broke college student I have no means to invest. I would love to get into it, but I have zero experience with this stuff. I have an iMac that literally just sits in the corner all day. It's my girlfriend's computer (purchased in 2015), but anytime she needs anything we just use my laptop. Can someone just please tell me what to do because I'm so tired of watching bitcoin pass me by.

I get so depressed knowing ill never have the money to be able to invest. I've been following bitcoin for months, but I'll never be able to join in. :(

I really wish bitcoin would crash just because I'm jealous as f**k. I have been watching bitcoin since it was at $1,700, but I've never had the money to invest. It literally makes me sick to think about.

Will anyone point me in the direction on what I need to do to get involved? I've commented on so many posts. I want to learn how to mine, or how to Invest, but no one even comments back...

Can someone just tell me what I need to download, how to set up my computer, and what wallet I should get? If that is even how you say it? I know nothing, but I really want to be involved. :(
