I may sound ignorant, but isnt this a legitimate reason to keeping bitcoin in exchanges? If price suddenly shoots up I can sell immediately rather than wait for a transfer to be verified and then sell, which at that point the price may have dropped.

Gotcha. Thank you very much!

Interesting find. Would love to see the community response to this. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:13:27
I sent an email, waiting for the invite!
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:11:44
I'm going to head to be soon. I hope you are right my friend!
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:12:33
I'll see how the next 48 hours plays out. I'm considering putting a solid 10% of my weekly paychecks into BTC as a long term investment
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:13:53
that's a $30 loss for me? I can't complain. I messed up waiting to buy. I remember being hesitant at $500 a few days ago lol. then I messed up and bought by impulse at 780-
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:49:05
My bad bro 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:47:51
Hahaha you're exactly right, it's what it was 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:48:20
You're right. I can afford to lose what I invested. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:09:24
I'm sooo worried right now :(
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:20:59
Gotcha, best of luck!
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:44:27
Yep. If we're lucky we can sell in a week for 1000+ plus 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:28:20
what did you call me&gt;???!?!?!?
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:04:06
I just bought one. Coinbase wants 5 days :/ hopefully it continues to go up by then 
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:44:13
Best of luck to you man!
@_date: 2016-06-27 01:42:37
Good read thanks for your insight 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:14:40
good point. I'll probably do just that. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:25:33
Yeah. I'm confident I can pull it off. If not I'll hold for another year or two and sell 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:09:50
What do you think we'll peak at? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:04:36
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:09:39
You think so? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:09:09
ughhhhhh. there was so much good speculation. I figured with high demand and low supply of transactions the price would sky rocket. Guess I'm still a newbie. Push comes to shove I'll bite my lip and wait a year or two to break even. Once it dips though I'm considering putting 10% of my weekly paychecks into BTC as a long term investment. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:16:59
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:33:31
For the most part high volume correlated high price though 
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:13:54
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:16:56
Thanks for the reply. I'll likely wait for a dip (i anticipate soon) then buy and transfer to a new exchange.
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:07:25
I can see what you're saying. I was fine until they shut down my account unexpectedly 
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:59:10
I'm appalled by how poor service they have 
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:13:45
I will. I just want my last $2500 out 
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:59:36
It's been a week....
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:07:51
They just closed mine and gave no reason why. WTF??
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:58:56
That's what I'm trying to do but the website has an error that isn't letting me do it
@_date: 2016-09-12 03:58:51
Second the above comment. Explain 
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:46:34
no it was for the comment asking for an explanation on how we'd hit 1K 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:04:01
lol noooooo. We're in an uptrending rally. Buy at the high $500's when we drop back down there 
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:04:23
implying the current wait times wont fuck the community over as a whole 
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:09:55
Well you'd figure with the laws of supply and demand, that with a lesser supply but same demand the price would sky rocket. Guess we were wrong
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:43:57
Good point. Thanks for pointing that out 
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:35:00
Bad. Reward for mining dropped from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. It is to avoid inflation. Overall it will make mining less profitable.
@_date: 2016-07-25 19:58:27
You can PM me of you want to discuss more. I've got a very good seller rep on some other Buy/Sell/trade pages. Check my account you'll see

Y tho 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:26:06
Anyone able to find a big liquidation? How’d we drop so fast
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:50:15
Western Union from a private seller? I'd be willing to help you out if you want.
