@_date: 2016-04-15 13:50:00
Yes ... except chargebacks imply that there is an arbitration process before the reversal can be actioned.  The approach you suggest will be guaranteed to work for the purchaser with no recourse for the merchant.
But, a multisig transaction with some sort of pre-agreed 3rd party arbitrator can replicate the PayPal reversal offering.

Why not just have deposits go directly to cold storage?  Then have a manual process to move a certain amount to the hot (or even better, warm) wallet on a regular basis.
This is safest for client funds and if the hot wallet server goes down, withdrawals can still be made manually (on a less frequent basis) from cold storage.
It also doesn't need an overly complicated smart contracting "solution".

I will have to politely disagree.
Work has commenced on getting Segregated Witness production ready.  A timeline has been established.  We don't know when it will go live but a target for initial roll out has been communicated (April 2016).
FYI: I am aware that this is only the beginning and more time would be needed for the ecosystem to adapt to the change.  There is broad consensus around the value of Segregated Witness being implemented from all corners of the community.
Also, most of the hard fork proposals are now starting at 2 MB with Jeff and Gavin's seemingly the easiest / most solid.
The one remaining point of serious division is whether we hard fork now / ASAP or implement Segregated Witness et al first and review.
The majority of the community is not seriously discussing:
* Not scaling at all
* A 20 MB hard fork now
* A 8 MB hard fork now
**This seems to me to be a lot of solid demonstrable action.**


Whether this is occurring or not, I fail to see how it relates to your previous point.  Please clarify.
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:53:19
Except that, as mentioned in my OP, Segregated Witness will effectively increase the block size to between 2 MB and 4 MB.
As it was spearheaded by Peter Wuille and [approved by a number of developers including all of the guys from Blockstream]( it is fair to say that there position is not to stay at 1 MB indefinitely.
@_date: 2015-12-31 03:06:48
Thank you for clarifying.  I stand corrected.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:33:52


Noted and I will adjust my language.
I still think objectively this position is closer to the "other side" than ever.  Most parties are now entertaining a 1.75 MB - 4 MB block increase within 6 months (hopefully).
The debate has moved passed whether to increase the block size and by how much and on to one of hard forks versus soft forks.
Although painful, it is progress.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:14:37


There will always be differences of opinion.  However, we can still achieve consensus with respect to the way forward without agreeing philosophically.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:09:02
My apologies.
I believe this is the consensus of a significant percentage of the community.
Unfortunately, the level of continued discourse suggests that a significant percentage of the community also wish to see a hard fork sooner.
My post was simply pointing out that the viewpoints held by the majority of the community are closer than ever.
EDIT: 
I also recognise that the Bitcoin Core developers have already started working on getting Segregated Witness production ready.  However, the option put forward by and is effectively the union of a 2 MB hard fork and a parallel soft fork implementation of Segregated Witness.  Therefore, both options would suggest work should continue on Segregated Witness.
The question remains:  Should the current Bitcoin Core development roadmap be modified to include an immediate hard fork or not?  I for one am not sure what is the correct decision as I can see pros and cons to both.
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:19:41
I think we can see compromise from all sides of this discussion.  Just look at the initial starting positions.
I am sure you feel that the "other side" has not compromised enough and that "your side" have bent over backwards - this usually happens when negotiating over a contentious issue.
But if you think about it, isn't it just as likely that the "other side" feels just the same?  Whether you believe their feelings are valid or not, I think it is useful to recognise that they exist.
*I am putting references to "a side" in quotes as I still firmly believe that we are all on the same side*
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:11:10


I am not denying that there are still some significant differences but I think it is sometimes worth focusing on the progress made.  It gives a sense of perspective and may help return us to a realm of polite debate.
Most of the hard fork options start at 2MB and of the hard fork options, it seems clear that the 2MB hard fork proposed by Jeff Garzik would have the most chance of reaching consensus so I only included this one.

Of course, you are entitled to your opinion and I can sort of see why you could have this view.
However, I believe the original and only purpose of a block size increase was to allow for more transactions to fit in a block.
Therefore, in it's fully realised form, I would definitely consider Segregated Witness to be a block size increase as it will fulfill this purpose.

I don't think this is intended to be a fully functional hardware wallet.  It is intended to allow BTC to function as a physical bearer asset.  You will still need hardware wallets if you wish to send and receive money between addresses.


I believe this was what I was suggesting with my option two.  Although given that people would rarely extract the private key (maybe only to cross international borders), a low tech solution like the one I suggested would suffice.


I think Opendime is an excellent concept but it is does have flaws.  
Some way (i.e. a zero knowledge proof perhaps?) to prove that the key was generated based on the provide random data plus environmental data would be amazing (but potentially impossible).

SegWit will have the same effect as a 2MB hard fork.  It also allows for the Lightning Network to be implemented on top (by multiple separate teams **not** just Blockstream)
The 2MB increase (hard fork or SegWit soft fork) are **both** temporary kick-the-can-down-the-road fixes.
Lightning network or off chain transactions are long term solutions.
Core is offering a short term fix and a mechanism to provide a scalable long term fix.
The 2MB hard fork is simply a short term fix but with no suggested approach for a long term fix.

Bitcoin Core 0.12 (the version released a few days ago and worked on for months) has features which will automatically raise the minimum fee needed for a transaction to be accepted by a node in the network.
This way the cheapest transactions (which are almost all spam when there is a DDOS attack for example) would be kicked off the network.
This means that we can handle any increase in traffic but just prioritise the more valuable users.

This is a theory but if it were true, Brian and the other CEOs would be clever indeed.

* The people behind the implementation of Bitcoin Unlimited

1MB + SegWit = 1.75MB - 4MB (in the event of a malicious attack)
2MB + SegWit = 3.5MB - 8MB (in the event of a malicious attack)
8MB is something no one concerned with network scaling should be comfortable with until we have implemented mechanisms to reduce the bandwidth requirement needed to propagate blocks.
In other words, we need IBLT and Weak Blocks implemented before implementing both 2MB blocks and SegWit.  In the meantime, we can "safely" implement one but not both.
Given that SegWit gives us much more than just a block capacity increase, the choice seems obvious.

It provides plausible deniability without the need for co-ordination with others.
1. Purchase an Opendime anonymously and set it up
2. Transfer bitcoin you wish to make fungible to the Opendime
3. Wait a month
4. Break the seal, transfer bitcoin to a wallet and spend
If you are asked, you can simply deny that you were the person who credited the Opendime in the first place and instead received it in trade for some good or service.  Like cash, there is no way to know if it passed through 1 hand or 1000 hands in the last month.

I don't know.  But write once, read only media has the potential to be far more durable than the read write media required for a general purpose hardware wallet.
I imagine that you could check the Opendime at the time of acquisition both visually and programmatically to determine how viable it is.  I see a case for an Opendime Checker tool that would be a battery powered keyring device that would read, check and display the public key QR code of the Opendime.
BTW, this concern is no different for cash.  At some point cash needs to be retired from circulation because it can no longer be used as viable currency due to accumulated faults.

They respond to most of these concerns in the FAQ.
But you can't be 100% sure.
However, you can order a 3 or 10 pack and perform the destructive test on 2 of the 3 (or 9 of the 10) to confirm that they were indeed secure and unaffected.  Given the prize of fungibility, destroying 2 or 9 Opendimes and only keeping one would increase your confidence and still be worth it for many use cases.

When Bitcoin was small we were able to have cheap transactions, fast confirming transactions and decentralised (and therefore resistant to censorship) transactions.
As Bitcoin grows it stands to reason that we have to make compromises (at least in the short term).
So what should give?
The decentralised element is the biggest selling point because it is the most unique and therefore most valuable.  There are many other solutions for sending money cheaply (Paypal is free between friends) and fast (Paypal and Visa are both quicker than Bitcoin).
No one else is decentralised therefore, I don't think that we should sacrifice our only truly unique selling point to maintain a non unique selling point that other technologies already do better than Bitcoin.

If different people have completely different world views, any amount of rational argument may not be enough.  At some point, you need to stop trying to convince the other party and get on with things.  After several months, I believe that this is what the Bitcoin Core team has concluded.

Thanks Only soft forks would be required. However, the examples you mentioned seem to confirm my concern that it will be complex if not impossible for resistant users to exclude the firm forked blocks.


Doesn't this mean that the balance of power has now shifted towards miners?
With firm forks, users can either leave the cryptocurrency, stop making transactions or upgrade to the new fork. However, they lose the ability to ignore upgraded miners.  Upgraded miners will still continue to receive block rewards, only forsaking (the currently tiny) transaction fees.

So we are at an impasse.  Being objective, both sides have thoroughly reasonable but apparently irreconcilable positions.
The inevitable conclusion is that the only way to resolve this is via Nakamoto consensus.
This may lead to two new currencies or (more likely) one true Bitcoin after the version with the smaller economic majority quickly dies or a choice being made without a shot being fired due to one side giving up.
Whichever way it happens, this seems to be the only way forward.  All parties now need to focus on creating and shipping code.
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:57:47


It seems that way indeed.  However, it is probably best to avoid the feature creep implied in my OP and to stay focused on implementing the currently well backed Core scaling proposals.
Furthermore, the Segregated Witness proposal would be a good first test for extension blocks-like soft forks and could help set a template for future approaches to scaling.

The current average fee is $0.04 per transaction.  If fees were to double (very unlikely in the short term) this would make the average fee per transaction increase to $0.08.
What actual use have **you** made for Bitcoin lately that you would not have done due to an increase of a few cents to your transaction cost?
Most actual present day users of bitcoin (investors, traders, dark market buyers or purse.io savers) will not be deterred from using Bitcoin for such a minor increase.

I find the "firm fork" mechanism both useful and scary.
What recourse do users and a "superminority" of miners have if they do not wish to run software implementing a new firm forked version of the protocol?
It seems to me that they would be forced to implement their own hard fork that somehow rejects the blocks containing the new functionality.  This would effectively hobble their own system by reducing its generality.
Of course, the firm fork concept can't now be uninvented, but its nigh inevitable adoption will fundamentally change the balance of power in favour of miners forever.
EDIT: Alternatively, if users decided to do nothing at all, no transactions would occur (other than the coinbase transaction) and the Bitcoin economy would grind to a halt.

Wow!  You two have gone at it for days!
My 0.02 XBT (Although no one asked for it)...
Summary:  I agree with Let's try (another) analogy:
- Many people (consumers) like (have a preference for) their things (commodities acquired in the market) to be clean and not dirty.
- It is a natural state of the world that eventually, all items will get dirty over time without action to keep them clean.  Having a preference for them to be clean does not change this natural end state, if left unchecked.
- If a lead supplier of a given item gains a monopoly by providing good quality cheap and clean goods and then decides to stops keeping them clean, then they are no longer fulfilling the consumer preference for clean goods.
- Customers will then switch to potentially lower quality and more expensive goods which are clean and the lead supplier will need to adapt or die.
- This action of consumers switching is what describes as "tearing down and starting over"
- Monopolies can occur (no one is saying that they can't)
- Without consumer action, suppliers will tend to act in their own self interest or systems will tend towards a natural state
- If a consumer has a preference for a non natural state or for suppliers not to act completely in their own selfish interest, then suppliers will need to do this or be made obsolete.
- This could lead to a situation where there is a constant change in suppliers or aspects of the system and that is not a problem.
- "Tearing down and starting over" is a vague bogeyman.  If consumers consistently maintain a preference that requires change then it would become inexpensive to enact over time.

Hi - I would like to delve deeper into some of your points if I may:


The meeting was publicly announced and the progress was updated on multiple social media channels in 2 languages. The final statement only agreed to make a hard fork Pull Request by July 2016.  It was made clear (if clarity was needed) that this PR still needed to be approved by the rest of the Core members and more importantly, adopted by the Bitcoin community in order to go live.
Is this so different (other than the multilingual communication) to what happens with existing Bitcoin Core development (which to be clear I also think is acceptable).

I too do not welcome a contentious hard fork but at the end of the day how I feel about it has no bearing on whether or not one will occur.
If the hard fork proves fatal then Bitcoin is not antifragile and maybe it is better to find this out before it gets even more adoption.
I think at worst a contentious Bitcoin hard fork would be fatal for Bitcoin but make the remaining cryptocurrencies stronger.  However, I think the more likely outcome is that Bitcoin(s) will survive.

The unrestricted "free" use of bitcoin could very well be relegated to the margins.
However as of 2011, [the **"margins"** (aka the shadow economy) you refer to was worth $10 trillion](
If it were considered to be a sovereign nation, the shadow economy would be the second largest after the US at $14 trillion GDP.  It is also growing fast so it is only a matter of time before it eclipses even the US.
So being relegated to the margins is not such a terrible outcome.
