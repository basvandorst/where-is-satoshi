for all of 2 minutes. WOW
they shut the exchange down because there wasn't enough people on it yet and the demand drove prices up faster than other exchanges.
it FINALLY opened a few hours ago and prices are normal.
STOP THE FUCKING FUD.

The only thing you can substantiate is difficulty change and exchange listing.
Maybe the price change is causing trolls and others to blare their trumpets in just some random uncontrolled fashion.
The listing and difficulty change are likely random. 
Otherwise you're talking about a major conspiracy and some of you don't believe in a dark government/banking cartels/jfk off'd by CIA? or other more obvious conspiracies.
I believe in a lot of crazy shit; but I'm quite tired of the screams of a conspiracy, beyond that of tether.

Just normal crypto exchange listing boost. Kinda helps that BTC was falling too.

You put yo demands up on my split, when you dip, I shit, we shit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:49:59
Sell at 30k, and buy the next dip to 12k. Maybe 50k+ in 2018?
The sky is no longer the limit.
