People are pulling out of BTC entirely since these thefts give the impression that it just isn't safe.
Once all the quitters are out, the price will stabilize and go back up.

Slavery is ethically ok. Just compare the quality of life for the American Negro vs. the African Negro.
One was enslaved, the other wasn't, guess who got the short end of the stick.

The vault 7 revealed that manufacture's are told to make their devices insecure by secret fisa court order.  Now hackers are looking for those backdoors and if wikileaks publishes them then any script kiddie will be pulling bitcoin heists from any mainstream device. 
How popular will bitcoin be when it can only be used from homebrew computers
Anyone that  strongly believes in Bitcoin is  believing in the future of ethical hacking

The electronics are insecure by design on government order

The fact is bitcoin was never a viable storage of value as the CIA backdoors allow any hacker to steal it from virtually anywhere was useful.
We were all fools to think the US government would just allow us to overthrow its oppressive trade hegemony.

YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT NONE OF THEM WILL HAVE JOBS AFTER BITCOIN TAKES OVER

Seeing that they got bailed out equally by the tax payer they should have to provide services equally.
Just like how gays can force you to bake their wedding cake because their taxes pay for the road your business sits on.

Seeing that the government has now become an institutional lender, the debtor should be in service to the people, but in today's oligarchy there is quite a divide between we the people and the government.

I've been watching BTC full-time since 2013, basically we're going to go sideways until monday afternoon when deposits clear on the exchange and there's a rush to buy at this discounted price.

I think that made sense to drop back to the mean in the first bubble burst back in 2013 but today we're seeing drops, bearing, and bull runs perfectly patterned with weekends vs weekdays.
It seems to me the price crashed from $2700 late thursday because they knew it was bound to happen friday and then mull around for a few days

I would actually go all in on ethereum, I believe the market cap will surpass bitcoins within 6 months, the golem project is going to eventually replace HTTP for webhosting etc, I mean the whole internet is going to run on ethereum in 5 years.
bitcoin is just a ponzi scheme
