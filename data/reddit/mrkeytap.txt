Now that I think about it; you are so right...  Like Yelp does (so it's been reported) too.  But, I think you get my drift..

And thank you for coming buy and saying thanks!  Very Cexy! @_date: 2014-10-23 17:54:31
Sounds like you installed the wallet recently; and as such the wallet needs to sync up with the entire blockchain.  This could take days in some cases.  Depending on the wallet software your using; you can bootstrap it using a pre-built history file and then it only has to catch up on a little bit and not the whole history.  Regardless; your coins will be reflected once the wallet verifies the blockchain history; whether you let it go on its own or you bootstrap it.  
Google bootstrapping for your client to get more info on that.

The term 'Cash Deposit' is used in a couple of ways;  most commonly you establish a bank account at a national / worldwide bank.  You ask people to go to their local branch and deposit cash into the account.  You verify it; then you send the user their  coins.

No problem.  Just a word on this though; banks usually frown on this if they know 'what' your doing.  Sounds bad to suggest it; but if you do this it is usually done fairly on the down low.  Banks usually instantly associate it with wrong doings; even though it rarely is.  Damn banks...

Find someone with btc that will buy it from you.  I don't know of any service that will buy it from you in btc; plenty that will sell you cards for btc; but not the other way around.

OK.... Well; that explains... nothing.  So, like the leadership needs to be in different cities?  How does a 'company' become decentralized?

Nicely done!  Here's a Cexy!  @_date: 2015-01-27 17:37:29
Actually, the API is what most have been looking for, and I could release that this week I think.  I want to batter it a bit more before saying it's ready for others to leverage. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:33:51
Great point; thanks.  I plan on putting the SC out when I get the first iteration done too.  I think I'll drop the ad thing; that was a free form development thing that honestly; I don't think I want to manage.  *meh*, starts to sound like work actually.  Not interested.  :-)

Pretty cool!  I like that better than GetGems!  But, like GetGems, they want you to use their own app. TeleBit works with the native app that everyone (that uses Telegram) already has.  It's just a contact that you add to your contact list and you're done.  No downloads; asking friends to switch, etc...  Is it a better option?  I dunno. But I think it's enough of a difference to keep going.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:06:15
Funny.  Nope, I'm not Daniel. Me-&gt; linkedin.com/a/goforthtech  I hadn't heard of them.  I'll check 'em out.  
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:45:01
I may just do that!  Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:56:12
Thanks for the thorough; albeit unrelated update.  Well... There ya go.   For more information on GetGems go to

Ahh..  I'm a Linux / Chromebook / iOS user... Guess I'm out as they don't support any of those.  Bummer.

I won't turn this into a side by side 'view' of what I'm doing compared to Gems; but I think (in reviewing their material); they are a ground up philosophy using promotions to distribute gems; which in turn can be Bitcoin.... etc., etc.,.  Sounds amazing; but I'm just keeping it simple right within the default Telegram App.  Of course, I'm not committed to building an empire; just building a useful tool for whoever.   They may be on the bigger path I suppose.  
In any case; similar; but not the same... I think.

For those following, most features of version 1 are online now.  Should have the first version completed in a day or so.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:35:46
And just like that... No more mention of ads.  That's a relief actually and takes a ton of coding off the table for a proof of concept thing anyhow. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:05:01
That's true..  If they haven't contacted Telebit, then they don't have a wallet to transfer into.  Easy fix; just share the love....
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:17:56
Every app has an appeal to someone.   Pick the flavor that you love and roll with it.  If your happy with it, then it's the perfect app.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:00:04
GetGems guys always 'post bomb' TeleBit posts...  *sigh*.   
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:58:48
So no skin pics folks!  
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:12:16
They are, different use case though... 
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:28:06
TeleBit is holding them.  You can setup forwarding to forward incoming to a wallet that you control though if you choose; including a threshold limit.  Not aiming to be the next 'Big Wallet' service, just small transactions among Telegram users. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:35:06
We actually just implemented tipping into TeleBit yesterday, so now you don't have to 'swap' contact info.  You just need their username (publicly available) and enter their name and the amount.  Like:
 0.001
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:26:20
Great ending to a crappy scenario.  Good show Coinbase, and good for you!
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:22:29
For those that have been following; TeleBit is nearly complete; well, version 1 anyhow.  The Wallet services are online; sending, receiving, forwarding, etc.  I have just two more features to finish, which I should have done by the end of the day.  
When you ask for your wallet address, the system also sends a QR Code.
The Forward feature essentially enables ANY wallet to receive deposits.  Set a threshold and TeleBit will forward anything beyond that to any other address you choose.  No need to maintain a balance in Telebit if you wish to not to.
You can now send BTC to any other Telegram User for FREE.  Just use the Transfer function.
Receiving a deposit to your wallet works great.
Once concern that I gave a lot of though to is "What if someone access my TG account and tries to send my BTC out using Telegram?".  To that, we have setup a 5 minute delay for sending.  You can cancel any pending withdraws by just sending 'cancel'.   
Anyhow, all that is left is your history and the ability to create a new address for your Telebit wallet.  You will be able to create as many as you like, with all previous address still working and pointing to your wallet.
I have gotten a TON of feedback and ideas for V2, including Multi-Sig, the ability to remotely 'lock' your telebit account, integration into markets... Lots.  We will vet the ideas and plan for V2 through our Reddit at r/TeleBit
Anyhow, thank you all for your feedback.  I posted this with and 'idea', and already have a product.  What a trip.

Moving between Telegram Users (Tip or Contact Transfer) is offchain; using the SEND function is on chain. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:36:15
I was too actually, so now you can tip users without sharing contacts.  They have to have a username setup in Telegram though; and then just tell TeleBit what to send to them like this:
 0.0001
