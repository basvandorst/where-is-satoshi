and at the same time if I were a drug dealer I would want to re up my drugs to sell more, and to do so I need fiat and as a drug dealer I dont have a bank to xfer my bitcoin back to it unless im a stupid dealer and want to have blind money coming into an account. Not everyone is escobar with a ton of avenues to get their money rebanked. So the idea of bitcoin as drug traffic is total bullshit garbage. if you want to stop rebanking of criminal assets then invade a swiss bank and see how far they get with that

Its not like they have the best track record as far as execution goes. Its almost like their thought process is hey this idea is good! lets bring in this completely untrusted 3rd party to figure out the rest and see how it works... in this case Zuckerberg is the regulator they are trying to bring in because they are too sheltered to realized the outsider is going to take their shit

I think these guys are kinda naive for trying to invite regulation into the market. I dont think trust fund babies get the idea that any wall streeter isnt your friend and trying to bring them in your house to make financial derivative products is like suicide. Letting wall street into a market that has a finite supply where there supply of money is infinite and in direct competition with cryptocurrency isnt really smart and is a good way to lose  a fight before it starts
