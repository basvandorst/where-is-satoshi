Do they even know where this guy is? Is he "on the run"?
@_date: 2016-08-23 22:05:11
Isn't that the same with gold?

Litecoin seems like a reasonable substitute for the darknet markets: it's got lots of liquidity, confirmations are fast, price stability is there.

They can see your ill-gotten cash, but everyone can see where your ill-gotten coins are going. Even if you had $70 million USD worth of BTC, it's still difficult to spend them.

Use USD for street dealers, use BTC for internet dealers.

People get excited about short-term rallies. But the technology is here for the long-term. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

Those lawsuits are what I don't think they will survive. If the bulk of their user base jumps shit, then their profits take a strong dive -- coupled with fending off lawsuit after lawsuit... It paints a bleak picture for BFX and Bitcoin in general. Perhaps that is when Gemini will begin to really shine.

I've heard mixers aren't entirely anonymous, but I don't really understand the technical details of it. You can mix dat shit pretty goodz for a long ass time. Will it still be traceable?

You get the guy who bought the private keys, and then try to track down the original dude.

You don't necessarily have to have a pass-phrase on your Trezor -- which I don't. However, I don't take my Trezor outside of my house.
But, I could foresee a situation where they arrest you and throw you in jail. It doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility for all the crazy shit that happens in Murica.

I'm skeptical of Poloniex's security. It may be based in the US, but so is Coinbase and Gemini. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:09:20
Yes. BFX could just be like, "nah, can't convert to shares. Keep the shit-tokens."
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:11:56
Good insight.

I googled that shit too. I thought he was saying something super-technical that I didn't understand.

How well does this super-technical jargon hold up in a court of law when almost nobody can understand the data outside the experts?
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:14:35
They have lots of users -- hundreds of thousands? Millions? Time will tell. It doesn't look as grime as Gox or Cryptsy. I think it's rough waters ahead for them -- they have a chance of surviving depending on if they get hit again. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:14:58
| We'll need a guarantee that we'll be getting those tokens back in time, and not the USD equiv.
There are no guarantees with money, and we all knew that there are risks associated with exchanges. It's not great, but at least we didn't get Gox'ed.
@_date: 2016-08-17 03:24:24
They charge 0.1%/day to borrow BTC. This is above average?
@_date: 2016-08-17 03:25:41
So they are playing a VC-funding fueled game of chicken: Last one to charge fees wins?
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:35:12
I like Coinbase, Gemini, and BTCC because you know who is running the show, and those guys have their personal reputations on the line. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:01:52
I believe they said that is a possible scenario down the road, but that is yet to be seen. Right now it's just a debt-token.

My post wasn't really directed at the OP -- more of a general observation among concerned Coinbase users on Reddit.

I'm not sure BFX will survive; the trust is gone.
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:10:40
To their credit, they've fulfilled their promises on withdraws, and the delays are reasonable considering their predicament. The exchanges that have collapsed (e.g., Gox, Crypsty) had delays of days/weeks/months before they completely shutdown. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:14:28
You were treasure hunting on the internet!
Can you give some information (doesn't have to be exact) about how the private keys were stored, and perhaps how you found them? 
Edit: Nevermind. I saw your post history. I know what you are doing. I'm agnostic on the issue. It sucks for the guy who wasn't securing his coins, but you did work for it. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:19:51
I could see Bitcoin being seized in the future. 
Edit: wait.. The police have seized bitcoin and stolen it for themselves. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:29:24
We don't know what the company is worth. But if we take seriously this debt, it is a company with at least $70m in liabilities. How long do you expect them to survive? What is their cash flow like? Can they take another hit -- financially or otherwise?
I think it's over. Gemini is looking up in all this mess.

If they can seize it, they will. If it's "secure", they'll try to seize it; if they can't, they can't.

Trezor. Paper Wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:25:55
The major exchanges that have fallen (Gox, Crypsty) create their own narratives about their demise. I don't see BFX being any different. 
@_date: 2016-09-01 23:01:02
I disagree. Gox took a knockout blow that (so far has) retired them. BFX took a hard hit, but they are still standing and could make a comeback.
@_date: 2016-09-27 22:42:17
2027 is pretty specific. How did you arrive at the date?

Seems plausible. 
Sidenote: After Darlene killed that EvilCorp executive, she took her e-tokens and paid the dude at the puppy-burning place. Investigators could easily trace where the executive's tokens went *after* she died, and then have found the puppy-burning dude; thereby tracking Darlene down.
@_date: 2016-09-01 12:16:49
When she is missing for long enough, they'll look for her. When they can't find her, murder is a possibility.
Also, because it was her cold storage doesn't mean that investigators don't know she didn't have cold storage. Storage is storage. When you get coins, where they go, where they don't go, is available information.
