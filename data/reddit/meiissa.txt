I feel bad for coinjar, they've been plugging away, building bitcoin business in Australia. They say the 10% will not increase the price, but how can it not? ATO ruling implementation has unlevelled the playing field on them.

I'm super excited for this! My market is very ebay-centric, mums who like using a simple system they are familiar with. I think this is very approachable and I can't wait to start.
Esp.ly since ebay started forcing us to offer money back guarantees. All my goods are 2nd hand and that's always been a "take it as is" thing, I don't look forward to chargebacks on books that look "old" because they're 30 years out of print, etc.

There is definitely a steep learning curve for some. I don't think I'm completely useless and I still had to put in a solid 6 months of research and reading to come to grips with what security entails. Even today, I think I could be doing better. 
Can't wait to see some more experienced hands lend in on this issue.

Merry Christmas r/bitcoiners! Thanks to the posts here I have learnt a lot this year and would just like to thank everyone for the breadth of knowledge and variety of articles that have been posted. You make it very easy to keep up with the latest news, serve as an early warning system on scammers and generally provide a great deal of varied and nuanced discussion on not just Bitcoin but crypto in general. 
I may be a lurker, but on behalf of the lurkers, the contributions here are much appreciated. I wish you all the best and I hope you all got a little Bitcoin under the tree!

Waiting on mine to arrive. I see it as a bit of a novelty on the way to a proper your-own-keys type of service that I hope will come about in the future.
