My initial amount was like $30k. I'm not really too concerned over that amount of money.

I could easily find another high paying job within a week in my industry with my background


I have insurance and I have other money outside of Bitcoin, just not nearly as much, but enough that it could last me a while if I need it to.

Just do a lot of reading and consider taking online classes or going back to school. Coursera and other free online classes are a great place to start.

I don't need cash. I have a good job with good career prospects.
I will cash out some if the price keeps going up. But we aren't at that point yet.

Yeah it's true. In the crypto ocean I'm only an average sized tuna fish.

I don't hate fiat. I don't have all my eggs in one basket, just almost all of them. I have a very good job (like 99th percentile for my age) and I can afford to take this risk that has the chance to propel me to actually being wealthy (I'd call that $10M+).
