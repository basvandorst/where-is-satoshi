Shut the fuck up

To sell on gdax i have to sent the btc first from my wallet to my coinbase acc right? I mean, the coins that you can sell on gdax are the ones you have in your related coinbase accoount, am I right?
Ty very much kind man.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:08:46
I don't know who that man is. It is just that your point in this post is idiotic.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:47:29
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:21:02
That was my point
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:40:44
I like how you think
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:09:55
U mad

I thought it was worth under 7,6324653k, have I messed up?

Honestly, this article is shit.
To begin with, Warren already said he doesn't understand bitcoin nor the blockchain technology, therefore he will not position again about it.
And the fact that it compares the .com bubble with Bitcoin claiming that when it bursted many scam sites (comparable to crypto ICOs) resulted in huge money losess is just stupid.
Obviously the .com rise was a result of the innovation the internet was going to be. 
My point then is that it is just senseless to compare the .com bubble with bitcoin itself, instead of comparing it with the CRYPTO BUBBLE.

Thank you, which exchange do you recommend the most?

Convinced him to buy the dip. Now HODL.

From what I understand, is a split in bitcoin due to the new segwit protocol that will be implemented like when it happened with bitcoin and bitcoin cash last August. But I'm also quite a newcomer so wait for someone more informed to explain it better.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:06:34
Little bit of sense of humour please. It is usual to see people talking about things like this with a new reddit account. It was just a joke.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:08:03
Yes, it was so hard, took enough time for me to go take a shit
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:54:51
I have them at coinbase, do you think it's safe? What about soft wallet like jaxx?  Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:17:39
Oh, so electrum has confirmed they will grant both coins, or says anything positive regarding the matter? If so, I will switch to electrum since I don't like Jaxx's silence
Thank you for the information!
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:22:08
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:30:39
Oh so I see, jaxx generated a private key for me when I created the wallet?
I have found the private and public key on jaxx. 
My question now is; are these two keys related to my coins for ever? Even if I take out the coins from jaxx?
Sorry for my lack of knowledge and thank you very much sir!
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:07:18
Do you know any tutorial? I was told aboyt gdax but got in and didn't understand anything about how it worked
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:32:10
Man it always has been a gamble, as because no one knew where it was going. We were lucky though it turned out well for the moment.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:39:27
Thank you for the answer, im taking my time to learn!
I see, but what I mean exactly is, my unspent funds will always remaim at that private key, even if I take it out of Jaxx.
In other words, the private key will always be mine and can be used everywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:31:17
Just as everyone else here, you are basically just gambling son. The volatility btc has shown, believe or not in the tech, makes an investment here can only be called gamble.
Don't consider yourself any better than a newcomer buying now. Not meaning to be rough though.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:23:55
Thank you that was of a lot of help. Therefore, using soft wallet like jaxx, owning my private key would be much safer right?
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:41:14
Can you explain how to do that? Novice here!
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:53:11
Thank you for the advice. I put it on 2400$ though, so I made profit and now I need it for life changing circumstances. So if instead of judgind you could try and help me that would be nice.
At least judge and help, not just judge.
And I answer you not in a bad way, just surprises me the vibe of your answer which I here see a lot.
