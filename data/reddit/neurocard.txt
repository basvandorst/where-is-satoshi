They are all quantum secure if you move your coins off an address every time you spend money from it. A quantum computer could pull a private key from a public one but if there's no money in the address then there is nothing to hack. Iota does this automatically but there are other crypto wallets that do it too

That's where you're wrong. In BTC world small fish and whales all have the same incentive... See the strengthening of bitcoin. In fiat world the government's incentives run counter to the consumers because massive debt necessitates inflation which antagonizes savers

Look at the deflation occurring in late 1800s in America... Led to one of the biggest periods of economic growth ever... Industrial revolution. I am guessing your haven't bought a tv computer or appliance there last 15 years? Massive deflation going on there... Must been the tech sector is a bust

These are great discussions!! Very interesting. Sometimes takes a correction to bring out the real minds.

How do you transfer from paper wallet to Coinbase? I used the sweep wallet feature on copay but don't how in coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:08:51
I went to the viabtc pool transaction accelerator... At the top of everything hour they take 100 transactions. I think that is what got move through

I was curious how prices will be fixed for super nodes on lightning? If your path goes through a hundred nodes how will you know the total cost before sending and evaluate competitor paths?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:57:18
The difference is barriers to entry... Very high right now with mining, very low with lightning nodes so much greater competition, more decentralization

Usd equivalent which he sets for auto buy and auto send in coinbase. I offered him $100 off if he paid yesterday for this month whichever he took.

Send a small transaction from your wallet with a low fee. It won't confirm and you won't be able to send other transactions in the meantime..

I get paid rent every month in BTC and every month I think the idiot of course pays me right at the ATH before a drop...
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:13:44
Why would we need big exchanges at that point? Won't we be able to send Bitcoin to a user wanting litecoin and have a node make the swap for a small fee? I think this is why Coinbase is hesitant towards segwit.

So glad there's a few other middle age gen xers around!
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:28:53
Thanks.  I was able to convince my tenant to start an account and pay me in BTC every month for a 5% discount. That's a win for me personally and for the growth of BTC.

I once sold some bitcoin to buy some paint at Lowe's because I thought I was exercising my freedom using crypto, but then the old lady cashier asked me to come closer so she could tell me something... With a swift right hand she slapped me and yelled "You don't sell the bitcoin moron!"
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:01:26
I am seriously considering just trying to live on BTC. I have a shift card so why not just convert my paycheck and spend as necessary without caring about current exchange rates? Sounds completely opposite of all investing advice but is that really investing at that point?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:41:54
2008 crashed as a result of the perverse effects of regulation. Regulation removed incentives and risk aversion necessary to adequately self regulate a market. What saver would keep his money in a bank leveraged 35:1 for 4% unless they had FDIC insurance and the hope of too big too fail? The moment you say regulation necessary you remove people's freedom to decide what's best for themselves.

Exactly... Gold was first valued for scarcity and beauty and then people figured out different methods for exchanging it. Otherwise why not use rocks?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:27:19
You still don't understand that it is not about the tech capability anymore... It's about trust and BTC has a hell of a lot more than anybody else. 8 years, no hard forks, largest network, etc
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:45:09
Bitcoin was a response to overly regulated markets. You don't get 2008 without Fannie Freddie Hud and the possibility of too big to fail
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:41
Even with higher transaction fees you can't say that it has no utility... It is still censure resistant, faster than international wire and cheaper
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:50:37
Actually it means a highly efficient economy where money and labor aren't wasted on disproportionately risky ventures.  Go read the history books on the industry revolution and you will see that the us actually experienced deflation for much of the 19th century and yet that was one of the greatest periods of economic growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:31:50
But high and send it all to a bch address from Coinbase wallet...

Only morons blame the medium used by criminals. Just take away guns and Bitcoin and then trucks because people kill with trucks oh yes alcohol lots of people die from alcohol related incidents, and what about hammers and knives? The truly compassionate fight crime and corruption by trying to change the heart of the perps and victims... Deterrence or incentive.

Growth built on easy money let to the explosion of credit default swaps and junk mortgages. With inflation people must take huge risks because playing it safe means your losing. Tell the people who lost their homes and jobs in 2008 that the volatility of a hi risk hi growth economy is worth it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:36:57
BTC is still far more scarce than gold. Regardless how many other people fork off it there will still only be 21million BTC. If the price of gold ever goes higher people will dig deeper and deeper... Maybe find gold on the moon?

I read somewhere that you only need to get one block Every so often inside the great firewall for everyone to be able trade bitcoin. That way not everyone would need to connect via satellite. Does that make sense? I don't totally understand

I don't see excess supply... There are people in every tree! The government would say excess supply cut private trees down and then we'd have famine.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:20:06
The organization of government is irrelevant. What should be most appalling about China is the level of violence applied to prevent people from making personal choices.

Excess never means worthless... Just price goes down so the supply will readjust for max efficiency
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:19:43
BS! No one understands the US economy operated by several million working adults with links to billions of other people across the globe. Much better if these millions synchronize their efforts according to their own interests than six people experiment with people's livelihood. A deflationary currency means that spending by governments and individuals will be as calculated and efficient as possible. What's wrong with not wanting to waste people's time and money?

Convinced my tenant to pay in bitcoin this year with a 5% reduction.
