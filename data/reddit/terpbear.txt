I mean, my statement was literally:


You said I was wrong. I wasn't. And it's an assumption on your part to send a partial payment and assume that a reverse transaction rebalancing the channel will occur in a timely fashion. There's no way to know how reasonable that assumption is, especially at this stage of LN growth.
Edit: And your statement on 50/50 in/out traffic is completely unfounded. I'd love to see any link from any member of the community that echoed that statement. I'm inclined to believe you just misunderstood how payment channels work and are now going into complete contortions to prevent having to admit being wrong. Impressive, actually.

How does the merchant know you won't hand the private keys to someone else after (or already have)? Not to mention, it's unlikely you will have the exact amount of BTC in an address necessary for any particular transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:18:06
That's...not how channels work. After Phase 1, B has 10 mBTC in the A &lt;--&gt; B channel. It also has 0 mBTC in the B &lt;--&gt; C channel.
In Phase 2, A can send 10 mBTC to B in the A &lt;--&gt; B channel, but B cannot send 10 mBTC to C in the B &lt;--&gt; C channel, since it's balance is 0. It would need a rebalancing transaction in order to have the liquidity to send additional mBTC to C.
Sorry man, you're just wrong here.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:16:11
Ok, now the B --&gt; C channel is allocated 0 to B and 20 to C. How do you send the next 10 mBTC without rebalancing? B can't send anymore to C.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:21:19
Except the first 10 mBTC unbalances the channel. It would need to be rebalanced before sending the next 10 mBTC.

That's not insider trading. That's just regular trading, something market regulators actively encourage... Markets should incentivize information gathering and research. Insider trading has a specific legal meaning. And since there are no officers or board or other people that would have a fiduciary duty to all bitcoin holders, then there literally cannot be insider trading in a general sense. Obviously there are hypotheticals on the periphery that might make sense but those would not apply to all bitcoin holders like it would the shareholders in a company.

It's discussed in the guarantee section. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:50:34
A security is different than a security interest in collateral. The ETN in this case is "backed" by a guarantor that does purchase the corresponding amount of physical BTC. But that guarantee could go away according to the prospectus since it's not required. Probably unlikely to happen, but it could. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:24:26
I didn't say it did? The question is whether the ETN is "backed" by actual bitcoin. The prospectus represents that there is a guarantee and the guarantor buys bitcoin in a corresponding amount to hedge the notes. Someone is purchasing actual bitcoin. I'm a lawyer at a V5 law firm and do this type of stuff everyday. I feel qualified to interpret these provisions. That's not to say this is better than an ETF directly holding the assets.

The Coinometrics version is an opportunity cost metric: 
I like how he is all scientific and then throws out $200MM out of nowhere to 'take into account' all of these other factors.
Would be interested in knowing what he disagrees with specifically regarding the Coinometrics methodology.
For example: The network is doubling at a rate of once every 2-3 months. If we assume the attacker holds no special position in terms of purchasing, then they would need to compete with other people purchasing new miners from manufactures. Does he really think an attacker could double the network ON HIS OWN in 2-3 months? If he can, then you at least have to project out the cost of the hash rate in 2-3 months (so at least double his cost, not a mere extra $20MM). If the attacker has to compete with other purchasers, then the cost may be even significantly higher.

If the crypto loans they provide to institutions are overcollateralized, then that should mitigate the risk substantially.

Is "ownership" a legal concept or a control concept to you? If it's legal, then you're wrong. As stated previously,  control over "private keys" does not convey unencumbered ownership in a legal sense. If it's a control concept to you, then you need to do a better explanation of why my analogy fails. Because, as much as I can see, the valet has exclusive control over the car for that period of time.
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:15:37
And in that sense, "ownership" of a car is defined by the physical rules of the world. Legality (in terms of government control) means nothing to those physical rules. The physical rules cannot be changed. If a valet controls your car away from you, then the analogy satisfies that concept, because the legal "owner" also is denied access to the property. And I'm confident I'm sufficiently educated, so you'll need to make your own arguments instead of telling me I'm wrong and to watch a video to make arguments for you.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:43:42

Right. There is a base level of property rights, even under a theoretical utopian level of communism. If not, then how does anyone do anything? Who determines who gets to use the plow? Or who gets to allocate the produce in what order of priority? You can never get full 100% agreement among people, so someone will disagree whether the sick child gets the food or the even sicker elder. So either individuals assert a level of control to exclude resources based on their own determination or they rely on the collective to determine and exclude resources. We call the former "anarchy" and the latter "the state". Where does "communism" come in then to disappear social classes, money and the state?
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:32:01
So whenever you hand the keys to the valet and he drives over to the garage, you no longer own your car?
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:04:34
The concept you're discussing is generally called a "bona fide purchaser". That applies to a specific situation and could also apply to a stolen car purchased in some jurisdictions. That does not apply to a custodial type relationship, where there is agreement between the parties on who owns the asset. Again, the law is clear. The only argument can be made if by "own" the bitcoin, you mean some concept of control. Which is fair, but also applies to a person having exclusive "control" over someone else's legally owned car. I get that the saying "not your keys, not your bitcoin" is helpful in highlighting the permanent and transitory nature of bitcoin, but we should be clear about how far that concept extends, and it does not extend legally.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:33:16
Except, if you want to talk about how ownership is a legal concept, then control over "private keys" does not convey unencumbered ownership. That is why a valet can have exclusive "control" over a car for a period of time and never own that car.

You're not overtturning the entirety of conventional payment systems overnight. You need incremental steps like this.

What does productive purpose does a currency provide? If you're on a desert island alone for the rest of your life and find a crate. Do you want it to contain a knife or $1 million? The money is nothing on its own, except when it can be exchanged for a true productive resource. Although, I suppose the currency has some marginal value as kindling. My point is currency is not a productive resource in an of itself, but simply a future claim to finite resource(s). In that sense, "holding" the currency can almost be thought of abstractly as a loan of that claim to those people that actually hold productive resources for their most productive purposes and therefore the deflation is your "return".
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:25:27
Based on my previous comment, my answer would clearly be no... it's preferable for finite resources to be allocated to their most productive ends. Holding bitcoin/currency is by definition a deliberate decision abstaining from utilizing resources so they can be put to greater use elsewhere. Not sure the point you're trying to prove. Take a moment and consider what I wrote.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:28:33
Why should it? If you're holding bitcoin or any other currency, you essentially have an abstracted general claim on all assets. Bitcoin/currency has no use to anyone in and of itself. No one wants a currency for any other purpose than to trade into a real asset at a later point in time. It holds no true productive value like oil, wood, etc. You can either do one of two things with currency, either hold it or trade it for some other good or service. If I "save" the currency, I essentially am foregoing my claim on assets at that time. That means that I don't reserve, use or exhaust real physical resources (whether food, tractors, labor, etc.), but instead allowing those resources to be allocated to others that will be more productive with those resources. Their production increases the total amount of true wealth of goods and services in society, allowing people to buy more with the same amount of currency (assuming the supply of currency remains constant). Deflation would therefore be the "tax" or, better yet, the "return" that one should receive for not utilizing resources that can be allocated more productively elsewhere in the economy.

@_date: 2013-09-13 21:14:34


This is not true (or at least confuses the point). The only thing that gives the USD or Bitcoin value is the same thing... the subjective value placed on it by people. Certain characteristics are valuable to people such as scarcity, acceptance, divisibility, fungibility, etc. When an object has most or all of these things, then we call it a money. Bitcoin currently lacks acceptance relative to the USD, but its real scarcity is much greater. I and many others believe Bitcoin will be a far superior form of currency because of this and other reasons. Acceptance can be built, scarcity is inherent.

This is a purely economic calculation. It's most powerful in a relative sense. Trying to account for the variables that you mentioned would be near impossible, even if they would prove valuable.
You are certainly correct though that many in the mining community have incentives beyond purely monetary that are not taken into account by this model, and therefore makes the model incomplete.

We specifically chose services to start with that are naturally highly standardized. So, for example, most snow removal services are modeled around a 'per push' price and a trigger depth of snow, the rest is just typical legal language. We take that service and draw up a contract that easily fits into what service providers are already doing, with the additional language that let's us trade the contracts. It's actually been fairly easy dealing with providers since our contracts are normally far superior than their own. Most providers actually have really terrible contracts, which isn't surprising since they drew them up themselves.

This is all assumed under the equilibrium model. While it admittedly has its own flaws, it certainly offers insight into the incentives at play. Because actors are rational, we can assume an attacker can either purchase the hashing power from other miners or build it up themselves. The fact of the matter is that the incentives (PV of revenues) are the ultimate driver. If we control for the revenues, then it is possible to estimate costs. This is entirely economic theory. Miners won't spend more where marginal cost &gt; marginal revenue.

On a given day, volume of XRP trading on exchanges is approximately $20,000-30,000 on average. And AT BEST 2% of all XRP in existence are in the float. There is no serious argument anyone can make that XRP has a combined value of a billion dollars.
VC funding is helpful, but having the support of the cryptocurrency community is even better. And most in the community have an affirmative distaste of Ripple.

Ripple is not open and distributed at this time, and therefore should not be relied upon to plan the future of bitcoin.

This allows for an updated and shared 'order book' across OT servers... coordination, in a sense. Bitmessage coordinates and OT executes the transactions, secure and decentralized.
It essentially kills Ripple, as now OT w/ Bitmessage appears to be far superior.

You guys desperately need to hire a lawyer. You're giving the impression people are buying "shares", and for all intents and purposes are selling shares. Every single person you sell these share to has every incentive to accept the dividends for some period and then sue you for their money plus interest.

I like the idea of buying for charity, but this shirt encapsulates all of the negative associations people have with bitcoiners.

At some point, people should realize Bitcoin and the community that embraced it and fostered it to this point was almost exclusively libertarian. I like the idea of not labeling it with an ideology, but I do hate socialists or other statists coming in to the community and pretending bitcoin was meant to further their ideals. They were not in the trenches for the last 4 years.
