Even if everything sorts itself out, no company that keeps you on hold for this ammount of time, with this ammount of money deserves more than 0 customers.

at what point it stops being investment and starts being gambling?

I'm currently waiting for more offers, I can't control myself!

The mere declaration that a government is hoarding BTC is enough to  affect prices.

"Because markets are evil and government is god". It's weird to find people like these trading bitcoin, but you find them everywhere.

It dipped, at least on bittrex.

THAT'S THE SPIRIT MY MAN

none, that's why I say 0. Usually though, people mean *economic regulations* when they say *regulations*. As in controlling markets.

Please don't suggest governments should hold BTC.
They will obviously hoard large quantities and use it to manipulate the price just like they do with foreign fiat.

I'm not bothered by minimal laws, but the ideal number of state laws should be 0

It just depends on how wildly hashrate fluctuates

Oh, so you think that [something that provides *inconsistent*, or, consistently *unsatisfactory* results] should be tasked with regulating [something that provides *inconsistent*, or consistently *satisfactory* results].
At best, what you want is to regulate an inconsistent thing, using an inconsistent agent (i.e. you don't know what you're talking about). At worst, you want to regulate a satisfactory thing using an unsatisfactory agent (i.e. you're crazy or didn't think this through).
Really the best case for you was being in the *false premise* group.

I think you don't know how to read.

Well if that's not enough you just have to wait, it'll most likely dip below 3500 until next weekend
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:20:14
A bit oversimplified, yes, but in the end, all desire for government regulation stems from the (false) notion that markets consistently provide unsatisfactory results, opposed to governments which consistently provide satisfactory results.

You clearly missed the *foreign* part. China can't print US dollars. They can surely print Yuan, and THEN buy US dollars with it (and they do), but then, they can also do it with BTC.

Thats like saying breaking windows will encourage consumption.
Keynesian economics is really the last thing I'd expect on this sub, curious.

You can regulate exchanges.
Pretty much ANYONE that decides to act as a mediator to ensure you don't have to make sketchy mcdonalds transactions gets to be the state's bitch,
