Let us know what you think Booneyxxo, should be much quicker than the previous BTM.

Hello Everyone,
We are the operators of the BTM at Café Blanca. The rate on the BTM is not 15% as what the OP has mentioned. It has never been 15% or even 10%. That would be extremely ridiculous to be charging such a high amount. 
In all honesty, it is at 5% and we will remain competitive. 
Hope this clears the smoke, and everyone is aware!
On a Side Note, Yes, Blanca does not accept Bitcoin currently, as the owners wish to wait and see before accepting.  But if you see Andrew (Barista), he will make you a Bitcoin Latte if you ask!

I do not have the answer as to why the price on google doesn't correspond accordingly on the BTM.  Our BTM pulls an average realtime rate from a basket of exchanges.  If you are able to buy at the rate that google displays, by all means do so!  No one wants to overpay :-)
We welcome competition as well, as it helps drive rates lower.
