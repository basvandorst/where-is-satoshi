Looks like Google and Yahoo are making the decision for us - BTC over XBT.   They can always change at a later date (if ISO rules that XBT is the chosen abbreviation), but I'd say momentum is on the side of BTC, and now XBT is dead.
Personally, I think this is a good thing.  Since neither was an official designation, maybe BTC will be made official by ISO, and the government of Bhutan will just have to stay away from issuing a "coin" or "convertable peso" or "colon" or anything starting with a "C".
More likely, they'll come up with a Digital designation, like D-BTC.  With alts coming out 3 a day, we'll eat up the Xxx designations too quickly.  There have probably already been more than 26^2 alts.

Stupid gimmick for you:   Prepare a brain wallet using a phrase, like "It's a pleasure to be on BBC.", and put some nominal amount of Bitcoins into the wallet.
Then when they introduce you, say those words exactly.  Then later in the show, explain that it's possible to transmit funds using secret pass phrases, and that you did it using the first sentence that you said.
(you might want to let the host know that you plan to do this, so they let you say the phrase.)

Rather than Base64 encoding, you might want to look into [Andreas Schildbach's Base-43 encoding](
There are 43 characters that are both URI safe and within the [Alphanumeric codes available in 5.5-bit QR encoding]( 
By using just these 43 characters, you can create very clean QR codes for maximum readability without being complex (since the 5.5 bit encoding would be much more efficient, using 43 of the 45 possible codes rather than your current 64 of 256), and you can use URI's to encode the data so that a phone can auto-launch the app (with a registered URI prefix, such as "bitcoin:", or whatever you choose).

I disagree, and my point can be demonstrated by looking at the extreme.  Extending your logic, it would be just as profitable to solo-mine as to pool mine, because in the long run, it'll all even out.
But the difficulty adjustments and the stair-step nature of the payout cause this to be untrue.  If I solo-mine my 100 Ghash machine right now, I most likely generate nothing but heat and electric bills, *ever*.  If I pool mine it with a top-3 pool, I'll get .004 BTC per day.
If a pool is so small that they are expected to solve one block per adjustment period (so every 10-12 days, or whatever we're seeing now), it's a death spiral.  Chances are very high that the pool will never solve another block, because rational miners will recognize this risk, and move.  And you can extend this logic upward:  If the pool only has enough hash power to expect to generate 2 blocks this difficulty period, then unless there is some heavy *publicly known* investment going on, it'll also be a death spiral.  repeat logic upward.

I think you should tier them.  I have mine in tiers of 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x, 200x, 500x, 1000x.  Ten wallets that sum up to 1888x.
So if you have 1888 bitcoins, x=1 BTC.   If you have 18.88 bitcoins, x=.01 BTC.
Then you can pick the right one to spend depending on your needs.
(Also, you don't need to fund all ten at once, depending on your financial capabilities).

I can totally relate to this.
Knowing the odds of Blackjack and having the capability to tilt them slightly closer to my favor by memorizing and counting actually makes me prefer Roulette, because it's mindless.  Calculating odds and counting cards is extremely taxing on the brain, and, even though it can only influence the odds slightly, I have a hard time just enjoying Blackjack without doing the work, because it's squandering an opportunity. 
With roulette, I can blame my losses on luck, not laziness.

Rewriting the *entire* blockchain has been prevented with the use of checkpoints.   The concern is rewriting the blockchain from here forward. Or basically ignoring every block that someone else solves, and collecting every mining reward from here on out. 
Suddenly, a confirmation isn't any good unless it's a GHash.io confirmation.  At the current state, this would render nearly half of the confirmations as useless, meaning that Bitcoin is half as secure.
And if you were mining on BTC Guild, and realize that every one of your block rewards from now on may be useless and undone (until confirmed by GHash), you better hop over to GHash.io, to ensure you get paid.

Stating the obvious.... With perfect future information, and assuming there are no switching costs, the best strategy given [my same goofy picture]( would be to move the investment around, trying to buy the one with the huge upswings ( at the bottom and sell it at the top.  
Then fill in the down periods of the highly volatile one with some of the other investment choices if they are going to go up, and remain "in cash" otherwise, assuming cash is a non-negative return.
So, in my picture, it looks like you'd start in the  long-term investment for a very short period, until  bottoms out, then switch to  and ride it to somewhere around the peak.  At that point,  and  are heading down, so you'd switch to  (brown) until  bottomed out.  Then back into  riding it to the top of its second bump, and then  until the top of its second bump, then back into   ...or something like that.
My point is that with perfect information, no single investment is the best choice, not  (high return) or  (high variance).   With imperfect information, the theory says you can improve your results over an undefined period (shorter than an infinite period) by buying some of each (assuming they are have reasonable expected gains, and their co-variance is minimal).
You could actually combine the three top three curves (as if you invested an equal amount in each), and see that for many time periods, the results will be better than any single investment.   For the "infinite" long-run,  will win.  But for many choices of a randomly selected much shorter period, combined is actually better.
That's what the experts in modern portfolio theory claim.
Anyway, I hammered this topic into the ground.  We probably aren't far off in our thinking.

13 comments here so far, and no one has this right.
1)  these are the Silk Road coins, not DPR's coins.  They were coins held for people who were silk road users.  
2)  These coins were property seized in a criminal investigation.  Consistent with all seizures, an announcement was posted, and people had a limited time to file claims.   I believe it was 90 days.   
3)  Ross filed a claim for his coins, but these are not his coins.  These are users' coins.  
4)  These are the coins that are left after processing the claims.  There were probably close to zero claims, because to claim them, you would have to provide all your info as proof, and, unless you were squeaky clean, you wouldn't want to do that.
There's no need for a court verdict.

I think quite the opposite.   People were throwing around dogetips worth fractional cents, and that's absolutely not something that should be encouraged.  I wouldn't likely exert much effort to pick up a penny; throwing a penny at someone's feet is an insult, not a hand-written note.
Further, all those dogetips for 0.3 cents were clogging up the forums, which actually caused many bitcoiners to HATE shibes.  
bitcointip had a minimum of a dime tip. One of the psychologies of casinos is to use chips so that you don't internally connect the value that you are betting.  So it doesn't "feel" like real money.  Bitcoin is real money, and we want it to feel like real money, so we need to help people make that connection, until it's finally second-nature.
Go throw a penny at the feet of a waitress that isn't waiting on you.  See how it's received.

I was not trying to defend the actions as right.  But generally speaking, it seems like a pretty reasonable process - I can't think of a better one.
Law Enforcement investigates a crime and stops the crime, and in the process seizes a bunch of assets.  Generalize this, and step back from the specific Silk Road situation:  If it was a giant fraud operation, or a bank robbery, or some other criminal enterprise, and Law Enforcement grabbed a bunch of assets during the shutdown, what would you have them do with the assets?
It just seems like a reasonable process to allow people to file claims, and to auction off what's left.

Right, and that's relative to the dollar.  (and in the last 24 hours, if you are looking at the same numbers that I am).  So my point is that Doge hasn't retained its USD value, as you said.  Not even close.
in 24 hours, it's lost 5.25% (your number, above).   
In 7 days, it's lost about 10% (from 45 to 41).  
All time, it has gone up from its initial value of zero, but it is lower than its first traded value, and significantly lower than peaks (or troughs) in late january, early february, most of april, basically any time since its initial rise.  It's on a major slide downward.

It's probably worth mentioning that alt-coin mining isn't likely to generate any huge windfall either, and it's still probably a better idea just to buy bitcoins.
Some people make a lot of money on alt-coin mining, but it's really in the timing, and getting out when the alt coin is at its peak.  And you can play the timing game without mining -- simply by buying and selling alt coins.  This is a lot like gambling, and still probably not the best idea.   Buy and hold!

After re-reading my long-winded message, I decided maybe [a picture]( would help to clarify.
I show 4 theoretical investments that generally go up, but at different slopes.  In this hypothetical world, you have perfect information, and the investments all follow sine curves upward.
The best investment in the long run is labeled.  But it's possible to have another investment in this universe that has a lesser long-term expected return, yet has a better short term return.  I show that with the second best long term investment.  Its bigger magnitude causes it to cross over the best one in the short term.  (It even starts by going down, where as the "best" one, I made it a really nice investment, starting its way up immediately!)
Further, it can be mathematically proven that you can pick ANY point in time on the "best" sine curve and it can be beat by another lesser investment with a different magnitude or periodicity.
This is an attempt to show that it's impossible to rank investments 1 to n, and just pick the  investment and have the best returns given any time period.

Look through [this list of 36 pools]( and see how many of those pools are still open.  This is just a partial list.

If you bought from Coinbase, this is common for new accounts.  The issue isn't the time it takes for Bitcoin to transfer, the issue is the time it takes for them to get your dollars.    (and for them to feel good about it).
Once they send you the bitcoins, you can move them and Coinbase can't ever reverse that.... but if your dollars were no good, or you reversed that part of the transaction, then you could rip them off.

I think the point is that by mining their own private branch, they would quit devoting resources to mine the main branch, and they wouldn't be winning block after block.
Ironically, this means that we should be *most* concerned if their hash power (as reported by number of blocks solved) drops suddenly.  would celebrate their success at driving GHash's dominance down, but it could just be because they are rewriting history privately, and will release the blocks later.
It's a little like when you are camping, and someone tells you "if you are trying to fall asleep and you hear a mosquito buzzing, don't let it bother you, because it's the non-buzzing ones that bite.  So only be bothered if you don't hear one."
Some small pool (NSApool?) could have 51% right now, and they're mining privately, and we don't know it.

This is standard procedure in any seizure.   This has nothing to do with the trial (it even says they're not Ulbricht's coins).  These are seized coins, and everyone had the opportunity to file a claim against them.  A few people probably did, but the vast majority probably didn't want to implicate themselves, and so they left their money unclaimed.
And in EVERY seizure, after the wait period, after giving people an opportunity to claim the property, then they auction off what's left.  That's where we are in this process.
The trial wouldn't change this.

Delete the last twenty (or so) bits of your private key.  This will require you to brute-force it to find your money later, with a million possibilities to check.   It's not a ton, and can easily be done programmatically.  But presumably those hurdles will be just enough to help you resist temptation.
Or, another alternative that I saw on reddit:
Create a 10+ question questionnaire, with simple answers, like what was the name of your elementary school, what was your best friend's last name in high school, what name is on your birth certificate, what is your social security number, etc.  Make sure that the answers are simple and absolutely unambiguous (so include hints to your future self, like "7 letters, all lower case", "include the dashes in my social security number", etc.).   append all the answers together (specify whether it's with or without spaces), and create a brain wallet (offline).  Never print the key - just the bitcoin address.
Print out your instructions (make sure they are VERY specific, clear instructions to your future self), and hope you remember all your answers in 7 years.  Again, nothing stops you from raiding it in 5 years, but hopefully it's a hurdle that helps your self-control.

Right now the only thing that is saving us seems to be that they are *keeping up the appearance* that they are not mining a private fork.  ~~With 67%, it'd be mathematical certainty that half their pool could be competing for blocks (and often winning 6 in a row), and the other half preparing a private fork to rewrite history any way they choose.~~
The could certainly be doing that now as well.  It's not a good situation, as you know.

Further expansion of the **proof of independence** idea:
There would need to be a fork in the protocol that changes the block solving rules.  Basically, in order to solve a block, you need to come up with a hash that is small enough for your *personal* difficulty level.  
And your personal difficulty level is based on 3 factors:
1)  The total hash power of the network (much like it's done now), to ensure that blocks are solved at a predictable pace (like every ten minutes)
2)  A factor that makes it more difficult to solve a block if you have recently (or ever) solved a block paying to this Bitcoin address.  The more success and the more recent your success, the higher your personal difficulty.
3)  A factor that makes it less difficult, if you can prove (through proof of work) that you have been mining at a certain pace for a while.
So to solve a block, you would not only present your solved block, but you would also present your best unsolved block  (i.e. lowest hash value) of previous blocks that would have been payable to the same address.
There's a pearl of an idea in this inspired mess, I'm sure, don't you guys think, ?

You should read up on [diversification]( and [Modern Portfolio Theory](
The theory contradicts what you are claiming.
Basically, you are making the assumption that someone could rank their investment possibilities, 1 to n, based on future return.  And then in that case, sure, your statement makes sense.  But even with perfect information, diversification may provide BETTER risk-adjusted returns than putting everything in the number 1 investment.
There are numerous scholarly papers that prove this mathematically, given sets of assumptions (and some that challenge it).  Start with the references mentioned in the wikipedia articles linked above.  But I'll try to give you a high level explanation.
First, investments don't typically provide returns that are a straight line upward.  Like Bitcoin has shown in the past, the long-term trend might be upwards, but there are shorter term fluctuations.  So you might have to look at each investment with TWO relevant variables, not one.  It's not just "expected return", but also "variance" or "risk".
So then if you have two variables, how can you rank your list of investment choices from 1 to n, even given perfect information about the future?  Well, it really depends on risk tolerance, how much weight you give to risk, how long you plan to leave your money in the investment to ride out the downturns, and many other factors.  Bottom line is that your theoretical "best" investment won't necessarily be the one that is expected to give you the best return.  Grandma's best investment might be the one that has the smallest chance of losing value - she's only got a few years left.
So your "by definition" comment is off the mark.  The correct way to diversify is to purchase assets *that have a low correlation*.  The italics part is key.  Then your risk-adjusted return will be higher than if you put all the money into asset  says the theory.
For example, let's pretend that you rank your investment possibilities from 1 to n, and bitcoin is  with a high expected return in your mind, but a very high risk level (it bounces around a lot, and an investment today might easily be cut in one fourth in five months, as we saw with a December 2013 investment). If some other crypto is your number 2 choice, it's not a good diversification alternative (since cryptos tend to move together).  But Junk bonds, as a simple random example (which provide high returns with high risk) tend to move independent of Cryptocurrencies, and can provide high expected returns with risk.
So by diversifying into another high risk asset, your *risk adjusted return* will be higher.  That means that when Bitcoin is down, your portfolio may still be up.

Hey, I am not standing in the way of you using whatever you want to use.  Why would you be offended by me wanting to support one eco-system with a defined inflation schedule, instead of Fed-like "all you need to have inflation is to add another coin"?
A) vendors need to realize that supporting Alts will have negative consequences.  It will.  You cannot deny it, because I am proof of it.  Go ask Bitpay why they won't process alt coins.  Maybe you'll get it.
B) Alt holders need to understand that alt-coins are crypto-currency inflation.  If that's OK by you, go for it.  But in my book, it goes against one of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin.  The key is that *I have the right to choose to behave how I want* and if alt holders can't handle that, and instead want to cram alts down everyone's throat, they're being the assholes not me.
Competition is good.  But I don't have to *support* the competition.  I'm glad that Google has competition in the Search business, but I should have the right to choose whatever tool I want.  And to claim that *exercising my right to choose* is somehow being an asshole, is, well, being an asshole.

I can only speculate on the exact methodology, but being able to look at the Gox data, one could see a significant percentage of the Bitcoins, and their distribution.   Presumably you could then extrapolate that across all bitcoins.
There are definitely guesses and errors in his methodology.  For example, I have purchased thousands of Bitcoins on Gox, representing ten buyers.  All ten still hold bitcoins, and all ten bought through gox (via me), but it shows up as one empty Gox account.  (Actually now that I think about, the number is more like 15 people.)

Your node will be a drain to the network when you first bring it up, until it gets all the blocks from when you last were on.  Then it will be a contributor (particularly if you allow more than 8 peers).

shorting is actually BORROWING bitcoins to sell them.  Then praying that the price drops faster than the interest on the loan, so you can buy them back at a cheaper price and pay the loan plus interest.
If the price goes up too much from your original selling price, you'll get a "short squeeze" or a "margin call" meaning that your account doesn't have enough assets in it to justify the size loan you have, so you need to buy back in immediately at the current higher price (which provides additional upward pressure on the market price).
Shorting is a way to magnify your winnings or losses.  It's betting the price will fall, through a borrow-and-sell strategy.

I sold a toyota through an ad, and the buyer came with hundred dollar bills, trying to close the deal fast.   He thought that was a selling point - a cash deal.   I felt like I had a huge risk accepting that.
The first thing I did was go with him to a bank and have him deposit the bills into my account (so the bank did the counterfeit check).  Then had the bank notarize the title transfer.
If he was paying with Bitcoin, the risk would have been transferred to him, I think.  Because once he transferred the funds, I could just deny receipt.  So you really need witnesses, escrow, or as you said, automatic transfer of ownership via blockchain.

Let's play with this statement a little bit...
Imagine a person of very poor means, which shouldn't be hard - there are literally billions of them around the world.   Now let's say someone gives them a tool set - say saws and hammers and screwdrivers and wrenches.  So yesterday, he had nothing.  Today, he has a tool set.  Is he richer?  I contend yes.
Now, let's say some generous person gave a tool set to every person on the planet.  Is every single person richer?  Again, yes.
So let's say that tool set, instead of saws and hammers, was a system that allowed people to store wealth inexpensively, and transport wealth to nearly anyone in the world, nearly instantly, nearly free.  Is every single person richer?  I contend yes.  
So the world *is* a richer place.

Initially, when Bitcoins were worth very little, faucets like Gavin's gave away bitcoins fom his personal stash, plus donations.  The idea was to get people interested in Bitcoins.  Those days are over.
Now faucets are making you "work" for them.... view crap, generate hits, solve captcha.   And those "jobs" aren't very high paying, and the faucet company is typically taking a cut.  So, really they tend to just be a waste of time.  If you get a minimum wage job and work for an hour, you can probably buy ten times as many bitcoins as you could get from a faucet in an hour.

All you have to do, as an alleged drug dealer is to file a claim that says "that stuff belongs to me" (with reasonable evidence), and they won't auction it off.  And in fact that is *exactly* what Ross Ulbricht did with the coins that were taken from him, and those coins weren't auctioned.
Hardly anyone did that, regarding these coins (I saw a report that one guy did).   These were coins held in accounts on Silk Road.  Yet the owners had a fair chance to file claims.
Why is this so hard to understand?

Sometimes people call you a scammer if you give them INFORMATION that they should be thanking you for.
Years ago when Bearshare was popular, if you searched for *.tax, you could find a lot of people's tax returns online.  I tried to tell a few, to do them a favor, and I got called all sorts of names!

The announcement of the seizure was posted on the Law Enforcement website, consistent with other seizures.   And consistent with other seizures, owners had a limited amount of time to file a claim for the property (90 days, I believe).  And consistent with other seizures, if they went unclaimed, they get auctioned.
People didn't step forward to claim their funds primarily because they either didn't read the website or they didn't want to file a claim with all their info, proving that they were a Silk Road user.
No trial is required for these coins.

Exactly correct.  More specifically, miners on the largest pool should switch to a pool that is not the largest pool.
Although P2Pool would be nice, there are obvious issues with being such a small percentage of the Hash power.  
If we could start by getting parity among the top 3 pools (by reducing  and increasing  so they both approach  this problem could be addressed with the minimum amount of movement.

One day I decided to try this bitcoin gambling thing, since I am trying to experience "all things bitcoin" (excluding the "lose my virginity to a hooker using bitcoin" that some othe guy did).
I bet the minimum bet on the best odds at SatoshiDice, and won.  Then quit.  Woohoo.. I may be the only guy to win EVERY bet placed on SatoshiDice.
Then I went to JustDice and became the house with a substantial sum.  And nakawa came in and took some of my money.
Clearly I am doing gambling wrong.  I won as the customer, and lost as the house.  I give up.

This is not what the traditional meaning of "backed" is.  When dollars were "backed by gold", you could literally exchange the dollar for a fixed amount of gold.  It was a certificate for gold.
In that sense, bitcoin is not backed as you said.  You can't take your bitcoins and perform a guaranteed exchange for a fixed rate of "belief in the soundness and utility of its protocol" or "belief in the safery and unique properties".

Agreed.  A long term solution should include "proof of independence" (a term I am making up).  This is a hard problem.  It's easy for one pool to prove that they are cooperating with another pool, but it's hard for someone to prove that they are not.
The idea is that the difficulty ramps up for someone who has recently won a block.  So winning two blocks in a row is hard, and two out of three is hard, and so on.
This would require you to register somehow (in the block chain) your allegiance, and would need to fend off cybil attacks (perhaps by dropping people from the registry if they don't have a certain minimal proof of work, proving that they *tried* to solve the block).
I don't think it's an impossible problem, but it needs some smart people (paging to take a look at it and come up with a mathematically sound solution.

No, sorry, I will not agree that you are correct, or at least do not understand your perspective.
My interpretation of your perspective is that you are trying to map investments with one variable, and say that you are "by definition" better off by choosing investment   However, there are at least three variables that are relevant.  You can evaluate investments using rate of return, variance and time horizon.
Let's say you had perfect information about the future of a number of investment options, and all of them had sinusoidal return graphs that were up and to the right.  Different slopes, different periodicity, different magnitudes.  Three variables:  slope (which basically equates to rate of return in the long run), and periodicity and magnitude relate to the variance - how frequently it varies and how much it varies.
Using this information, the best "long term" investment option would be the one with the greatest upward sloping sine wave (where "long term" = infinity).  I am thinking that your "by definition" comment would select this one investment as the best choice, and if you select any other choice, you are "by definition" choosing a lesser option.
But at **any** future point in time, it is **always** possible to select a different investment to invest in now, which has a lesser upward slope, and still performs better to that time point, because of the differing magnitudes and periodicity.
And given that the typical investor goal is to try to improve their investment results *regardless* of the timeframe (i.e. no one can wait infinitely long), an even better option is to select a portfolio of investments with high slopes and various periodicities and magnitudes (i.e. low correlation).  This will yield the absolute best result when analyzed over multiple endpoints in time.
Your whole "by definition" comment is precisely where I think you are incorrect.
Maybe I am misunderstanding your perspective.

I tried to understand this myself, and the best explanation I can tell you is this:
Prior to P2SH, you could pay only to a bitcoin address, and then that address could unlock the money to pay it forward by proving ownership of the private key.
With P2SH, you are locking up the money until someone can produce a script that hashes to the correct answer that you paid to.  That script unlocks the money, so it can be paid forward.
What this means practically is that instead of just being able to pay someone, you can put conditions on the money.  Like 2 out of 3 people need to combine to release the money, or some contractual condition needs to occur.
...not an expert though, but that's what I got out of studying the topic.

I was a big user of bitcointip, and got a lot of attention in for some well-placed tips in other subreddits.  Tipped a total of about 2 bitcoins over the past year or so.
But I haven't sent a changetip yet.  I like and hate "bits",... I agree a one-syllable, 4- or 5-letter word for 100 satoshis is ideal, but it frustrates me that there was such opposition when bits was chosen.  No other suggestion has caught on (mikes?  zibs?  ubits (2 syllables), I've seen a few.)
changetip is probably in the best position to make a term like "bits" stick (along with bitpay, coinbase, bitcoin QT, and the exchanges). 
I need to get back into tipping.  I think with the change of adding a dollar translation (so when I tip 4000 bits, people can see i just gave them $2), it could really help.  Otherwise, you waste a good size tip on what looks like funny money.  "4000 bits?  what the hell is that?"
I don't care for the name "changetip", and wish it said bitcoin somewhere in it.  But that's marketing on their end.. and a decision that's probably driven by wanting to do more than just bitcoin.  So I get it.

Mining tends to be a losing proposition.  Your ROI is totally dependent on the price you pay for your mining equipment, and basically sellers tend to price them much more than the Bitcoins they will generate, because the market pays that price.  So don't fall for that.
Or at least do the math, and know what you are getting into.  Generally it will be a losing proposition, or at best break even.  You are much better off simply buying Bitcoins and holding them.
Then the next step would be to open a  price chart like bitcoinwisdom.com, and stare at it until you are rich.  (JOKE!)
Once you have an investment, investing only what you can afford to lose, then the next thing you should do is look for ways to help your investment grow.  Build stuff, if you write software.  Participate in the meetups.  Participate in a positive way on the forums (helping others understand Bitcoin).   Study it and understand why it is truly breakthrough.  And then help others understand, without sounding like an evangelist.

10-12 random words?
I think you're off the mark on this one, If OP is storing a PDF of a QR code (as opposed to a PDF of the encoded Private Key), then this is likely pretty safe from something that is auto-scanning looking for keys (especially if it's not called "bitcoin key" or something like that.
In the event that someone finds it, a simple phrase will keep it safe.
I wouldn't store $10k this way; there are better ways with less risk.  But it's not terrible.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:21:06
nope.  
The number of bitcoin addresses is smaller because a 160-bit hash of the 256 bit private key is used.   It really has nothing to do with primes.
Edit:  technically not quite accurate, but close enough.  It's a 160-bit hash of something derived from the 256-bit private key.

Cringe number one for me was when she said that the US Government was going to auction off a *cachet* of bitcoins, mispronouncing *cache*.
In this case, pronouncing cache like cash when talking about a financial instrument would have been the right thing to do.  Not to mention, "cash" is the proper pronunciation of *cache*.
