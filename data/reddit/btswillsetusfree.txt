Great summary of the new features:
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:22:06
This is the free market in action.
The majority thinks the current, immature, highly illiquid bitUSD market is closer to internet funny money than a real asset.
I don't see a problem?
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:37:21
Nubits are subsidized and have some ponzi-like attributes. Lots of very informed discussion on the BitShares forums with regard to Nubits.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:34:42
We will have to let time and free markets decide the Nubits vs. bitUSD question.
However, bitUSD is certainly not the featured product of the BitShares platform.
The P2P bond market will likely be the big one, followed closely by the TPS/conf. times, followed by UIA and pegged assets. I see the NASDAQ and Nikkei pegs are being set up now. 
It's the one-stop nature of the platform that gives it legs. 
BitShares is finance, decentralized, globally.

Nope, completely different tech, oil/water.
But I suspect we will see more and more people buying bitBTC, so they can get exposure to BTC price movement while taking advantage of BitShares superior features (1 sec conf, 100,000 TPS, dynamic permissions, recurring payments, etc.)
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:23:30
Yes, this. The tech is brand new and has very little liquidity.
The fact that the pegs have held, and continue to hold as well as they do in such a thin market is very promising.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:17:58
Point taken.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:19:55
^ This.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:12:53
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:19:30
Apologies. Little trigger happy right now...
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:41:19
Yes, exactly.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:29:25
There is no spoon...
Have you considered Bitcoin may well be an altcoin in the not too distant future?
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:28:40
Code is up on Github, no vaporware here. It's real.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:30:00
I've been in the space for a few years, and I'm constantly faced with the irony of the Bitcoin crowd's mentality:
Bitcoin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything prior
Bitcoin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything after
The brutal fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is 1.0 tech that is going to have a hell of a time keeping up with the 2.0 tech. Look at the block size debate.
I like to think of myself as well diversified and relatively well informed on most significant crypto projects. Today the BitShares feature set moved well ahead of the pack, including Bitcoin.
Tomorrow a 3.0 tech is going to crush BitShares 2.0 tech. It's the nature of the beast. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:06:38
I am saying it is the future of decentralized global finance.
Bitshares addresses many/all of the issues with Bitcoin and adds massive functionality. 
The potential of dynamic account permissions alone is staggering; collateralized P2P lending is massive.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:27:08
Amazing developers and whole lot of blood, sweat and tears. 
BitShares has pushed through a lot of roadblocks in the last year.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:33:28
Nubits are subsidized and won't scale - lots of very informed discussion and analysis on the BitShares forum.
Plus they are Nubits. Sounds like something to snack on...
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:13:17
Yes, this is absolutely not Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:19:02
Did you guys read Daniel's blog posts on Nubits? I'm not speaking out of ignorance, Daniel made some very good points...
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:17:26
Horses for courses. 
Enron was always a good investment, till it wasn't.
It's the fundamentals...
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:31:48
Yes, your user experience is the reason for 2.0.
I and everyone who used the early client experienced crashing and hanging. 
The majority of these problems were resolved sometime around 0.8, and I haven't had the client crash recently (3-4 months?).
However, the devs didn't just patch up the old tech. They completely overhauled from the ground up. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:35:54
Because they are either more or less valuable than USD, depending on your viewpoint.
Some people will find the features of crypto-assets (secure, private, instant, no bank required) make them more valuable than the meatspace equivalent, and will pay a premium.
Other people will find crypto-assets to be internet funny money and feel they are worth less than meatspace assets.
The actual value is somewhere in the middle.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:28:04
Yes, they've had 10s confirmations for a while now and honestly every transfer I've done has seemed instant.
But now, wow!
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:47:34
Interesting, I'll have another look.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:18:04
You sound a lot like someone who hasn't actually used BitShares, or perhaps tried it some time ago.
I've been using the BitShares client since the first release. The current client has come a long, long way.
But that is irrelevant. 2.0 changes the game completely. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:15:59
But yes, BitShares has had a lot of pushback from the Bitcoin crowd.
What's that saying? First they laugh...
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:14:14
Funny shit!
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:20:25
You can get exposure to price movement by buying BTS. The last year has been quite a ride but BTS is on a tear right now.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:15:19
No, this is absolutely not a scam!
Bitshares has one of the best development teams in the crypto space.
The tech is solid, the code is on Github and the platform is running right now.
