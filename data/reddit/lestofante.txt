So you moved a big quantity of money in a shadow way through a untrust person and you lost all?
I call that natural selection

Even on elevator you'll find your ride may be awkward. The fact that you must go over it and take the elevator/underground anyway does not make the theory wrong.

You are keeping so much money on a non-your address? This is asking for trouble, where fee is the less problematic

You should educate yourself on the policy in Microsoft called "embrace, extend, exterminate"

I don't understand what you are saying, please try to expands your concept

not a good idea, if multiple thing has happen is hard to find an article that is updated and complete, one have to loose a lot of time recreating the puzzle.
My contex (lets see if i got it right):
Roges as given CoinOK the permission to manage bitcoin.com in exchange of part of the revenue.
CoinOK forged a fake contract (coping the digital signature from the original contract) and used that and some excuse to recess the contract without paying penalties.

An uncovered check is a classic.
And a student with 25BTC? Not so classic. In India? A very rich student.
So yeah, you are (or was) one with power, and if you don't know how to manage it is better this way.

yes, you see, you have probably only one input transaction with all your coin.
Bitcoin must use ALL transaction, so basically when you moved $0.05 you really had created a transaction with multiple output, one is the final payment, another is the original address (money come back!), and final is fee:
1. take as input the transaction with your money ($x)
2. has 3 output:
 a. the target address (for $0.05)
 b. your original address (for $y)
 c. no address (fee paid to miner) for the remaining (so fee = $x-0.05-$y)

Personal space is common to all culture, see 
@_date: 2015-12-07 10:02:31
no, everybody has a "personal space" around him, the closer (in sense of friendship) to you the person other person is, the close it can get to you.
Of course there are exception, but for sure is awkward to be in contact with a person you are discussing.
Edit: see

No, that should ne fixed by YOU forcing HTTPS. Unless the certificate chain is broken, you will get a certificate error, or in case HTTPS is blocked, you will not connect. 
Is there a way to blacklist that exit node and force browser to use ONLY HTTPS on certain site?

Got friend learning something similar in harder way, so don't worry too much and move on, just be more carefull next time

still can't undertand what the number in colored box mean. Maybe
    TRANSACTIONS IN MEMPOOL
    TRANSACTIONS SINCE 24 HOURS
or maybe
    Unconfirmed transactions / Transactions today
Also to get it right is should be nice to understand what is the median wait in block number; if those number are unconfirmed transactions then i see 24 with the highest fee/byte and they became 12, are only half been put in the block or they have been all elaborated and then 12 new had arrived, or no block has been mined and 12 has been refused as invalid?
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:15:38
I can't understand what all those number are. Can you give a legend?
