Just so everyone can see his apology. I am glad Robocoin decided to take a stand and man up for their actions. Justice was served, and it tastes GREAT!

Just a question, why is Changetip the rally trigger?

Why are the banks doing this? Because they’re mad. One of the provisions of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act would limit the fees they can charge merchants for processing a debit card transaction to 12 cents a swipe. Merchants say that this well let them pass on savings to consumers in the form of lower prices. Banks say it will cut into their $15 billion they make a year off these transactions by 70%. They say they have to make up for it somehow. So what’s the cost-saving move here? Does it really cost that much more to process 3 zeros instead of 2? No. While they haven’t come out and said it, this move would push more people towards credit, which they can charge 2-5% of the total cost in transaction fees, as well as make money in interest off of. Or people will use cash, which, while meaning they don’t collect transaction fees, they also don’t incur the operational cost for processing.

This is a game changer idea. I was also thinking of other ways to replace the QR code, but did not have the skills to make it happen. I am glad to see that people are innovating and trying to make Bitcoin better! Brings tears of joy to my eyes. I hope all goes well with Android 5.0! GOOD LUCK!
