"Si-si" and "bitcoin" - that's all I understood.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:21:22
It's a book about early bitcoiners history. Fascinating at very least! Must read.

OP will get sued by Faketoshi, because Faketoshi created this meme !

"\[Lightening\] It  supersedes any Vitalik Buterin "smart contracts" for trading cartoon poneys."
As well as other scamcoins capitalizing on the "smart contract" buzz.

Guys, lets zoom out. Here is how I see it : Media defending bitcoin now, president's administration and senators have opposing views .  
It's way better than when everyone was fighting us  couple of years ago!
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:12:14
The real question is how was it paid for !
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:02:40
Why does Queen Elizabeth have a beard ? ( she in on the left in the middle)  And why is she even on this picture ?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:01:04
Ouch. Unless it’s Satoshi hedging his profits.
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:52:57
Bugatti? They should have accepted 9 months ago. Now Chevy 
@_date: 2018-09-09 23:47:39
Don’t know whether prosperity or pain, but it’ll be hot for sure!

If you make it for FED - it should be $10000
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:52:24
Author is a Bcasher, or at very least, biased !
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:23:42
At least for lulz!
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:07:11
Richard Heart is shilling hard. It looks like he entered a short on the dip down, right before it bounced.
Now he resent about possible hack. Lol.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:50:27
For the records, who coined this term?
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:59:57
They are inflating our bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:20:48
Yes, it is! There is proof of milk and cocoa on the way of changing consensus landscape.
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:41:03
So, is it AIR or Loop now ?
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:49:27
mining people sounds like singularity 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:18:24
Almost as secure. Lol
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:52:38
Nice art!
I like that you included Richard. He certainly belongs here.
Btw, who is a naked guy on the center right ?
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:48:53
I wonder what is the reason why you don’t get any traction here.
Is that because don’t believe people or don’t care ?
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:09:20
I’m one day it’ll be “zoom out a couple of years”.
@_date: 2018-10-14 14:11:51
Sigh...Vertical dummy.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:21:55
Retesting $6200. Let’s see if the bottom is the bottom. Or if me can drop more.
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:38:09
Looks like Chicago talk from 6 months ago
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:11:58
I wonder if Peter is wearning pants on these videos when he is a talking head.
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:44:35
OP, give us the link so whe can show you what trolling is
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:48:28
Looks like BlueWallet to me it’s really cool, but still buggy, therefore 
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:35:23
How about sticking some coin mixers to the page? Whole community benefits with more people using them. The more people, the better, no ?
@_date: 2019-02-17 12:00:27
Guys, lightning is great, but let’s be honest- Dominos is shit food! 
If one want to enjoy the future - he should quit eating this crap.
@_date: 2019-02-22 01:13:13
good meme format
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:37:04
Right, then altcoin sneakers would be way warmer !
@_date: 2018-11-09 02:58:11
Repeat after me :  “ not you keys - not your bitcoins”
Me: not your keys
You: ...

“Honey, we will have a Pepe frog in 9 month!”
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:43:21
Let’s add couple more dimensions to these memes!
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:56:48
Barry got some meat. 
It’s not a constructive comment - just a passive-aggressive observation.
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:34:08
Watch to the end. Last 30 seconds are better than gold.
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:58:15

I’d say free is still cheaper

Someone should remake Sinatra’s Moon River: “ Blood River, longer than a while, we crossing you with (blank)...” an so on

Ok, he is a serious question : is giving and receiving tips a taxable event?
When you tip - you realize your gains / losses. Technically you have to report it, don’t you ?
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:29:00
I’d suggest to watch is only if you have infinite amount of time.
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:04:09
Who listens his shows? He is very repetitive and not thoughtful. His ideas are plane and banal. No?
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:26:54
Casa node ?
@_date: 2018-12-22 13:49:32
Bitfinex lost  120k bitcoins worth $72 mil in August 2016 with the hack, when finex issued their own tokens to compensate for the loss.
And it’s only one hack. Please, educate yourself before “betting” on things you are discussing.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:25:05
I think that there is an option with Trezor to do that. But I’m not sure. Can someone confirm?
@_date: 2018-12-24 11:31:07
Just in time, huh?!
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:44:17
Hi, mr. Troll. Low karma with 3 comments. 
Or tax evasion thinking here to “document” the loss. Good luck with that!
