Another dinosaur slams Bitcoin what a surprise
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:02:12
you suck, you must not have read it cuz it's about Bitcoin douchebag
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:43:24
thanks for this
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:27:16
They sure are man.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:09:41
What about mining? does that price even make it profitable at all now?
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:26:07
"We don't know how to use our cell phones or computers either."
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:47:44
So if you're in the Futures Market and the only way to profit is when the price goes down then I would guess that there would be a lot of investors wanting to see the price decline so they can make a profit.
That means the powers-that-be could also be behind the price manipulation so that their Buddies can be rewarded when Bitcoin crashes.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:51:32
to manipulate the price to stay at or around 1.00?
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:11:11
My understanding is that's by Design.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:08:05
So that's normal right I mean how else do you keep the price at around $1
@_date: 2018-06-15 21:53:06
It amazes me how some people in the Bitcoin subreddit would downvote an article that was posted for the purpose of defending/promoting  Bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrencies. I don't get it.
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:42:41
Well that's your opinion and you're entitled to it.
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:18:28
What about the Lightning Network?
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:19:43
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:03:43
Holy shit
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:39:35
Sorry didn't mean to offend you.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:06:13
I was fud spoofed
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:42:30
You're right I think everybody's a little tense because of the market conditions.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:12:35
Isn't the whole point of tether to stay right around $1 to be stable?
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:22:50
Yeah just to clarify I wasn't picking on your community I work with a lot of people in government offices and different businesses and I'm always shocked at how nobody seems to know how to use their phones or their computers, let alone understand cryptography.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:34:13
Yeah and I used to support dial-up users, that was before I could remote into their computers.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:16:15
So wouldn't Bloomberg be better served pulling data on bitcoin since Bitcoin seems to be tied to all the alt coins, I mean if they want to check for manipulation maybe they should start there.
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:47:11
Well if this douchebag is anti-bitcoin we all need to step up and make sure he doesn't get elected to any kind of office especially President of the United States, we're tired of douchebags.
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:22:08
I'm guessing they can just do their thing and we'll just do ours.
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:04:55
I ditched Facebook
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:12:06
fading fud
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:02:03
A state-issued centralized coin? No thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:56:39
You're still using Facebook? I left, good riddance
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:37:18
Well apparently you haven't watched the news about Facebook lately and if you have and you don't care that your personal data of you and your family was sold to a unethical third-party then I guess you're on your own.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:58:10
This post should be getting a million up votes where is the community?
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:56:05
Well if you don't have an hour to support the entire cryptocurrency community what is your purpose here? you should sell all your coins and go back to your job washing cars.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:38:57
You keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:22:53
Of course you are
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:45:20
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:01:25
Exactly because you don't want to invest the time to understand the topic completely first-hand that's what's wrong with the Youth of today they live in a microwave mentality they want everything in 30 seconds, put in some effort do some work and actually learn something and then contribute don't just expect everybody to hand you everything in life in 30-second increments.

@_date: 2018-02-22 22:27:21
Oh sorry my life is crypto that's all I do is eat sleep and breathe it and I spend hours researching every aspect of it and if this case could be a precedent for trying to bring down BTC and everything else then yes it's got my full attention and shame on you if it doesn't
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:02:00
It's not a security threat to your computer it's a security threat to any coins/keys that you might put on it.
