I think they actually are good guys, in the sense that they think they are doing something positive in the world. I honestly can't blame them for that, as a fellow human being. But I just don't see how culturally accepted violence is the answer.

I'm not saying dogecoin is nothing. I just don't believe that dogecoin has ever done more volume in USD than BTC on any day, ever. I'll need to see evidence for that extraordinary claim.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:13:31
It's possible, but they barely touched on bitcoin. If I remember correctly, Stefan mentioned it in passing and they never really got into it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:37:22
The amount of bitcoin has a very real bearing on the security of my web wallet account. If someone finds out that I have 100 bitcoin in a web wallet, they are much more likely to try gain access to that wallet than if I only had 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:22:45
Should be top comment. Disappointed in you r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:24:56
Yea, there are so many factors. We're really just taking our best guest on how people react to information.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:42:57
Because I was responding to the original point which was that 900 btc being stolen is somehow relevant to someone putting 0.1 btc on a web wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:51:05
Bitcointip has a policy that you can't access the btc until you are unbanned (because you can't use the automated system while unbanned and it would therefore take a lot of time to process requests manually from banned accounts). However, they have made exceptions and I hope they would if this guy got tipped a lot.
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:27:36
He had him on the other day as well. Bitcoin didnt get more than 5 min between the 5-6 total hours of podcast.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:04:45
Because any old guy isn't putting ~900 bitcoin into a wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:57:39
Awesome video. People can debate whether this "contest" was a good/bad thing for bitcoin, but this video is something that will reach a lot of non-bitcoin circles and turn a few people on to internet of money.
@_date: 2014-01-18 08:08:01
Thanks for expounding on this short clip!
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:35:47
I'm more impressed with the ability of dogecoiners to upvote posts in other subreddits than the actual currency itself. Evangelism is great, but only if it is followed by innovation and adoption...
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:39:37
Absolutely it's a low bar. It's just basic compassion for people that think force is an acceptable solution. Is Hitler the same as a financial regulator? Of course not. But anyone that is using coercion as a means to an end shares something fundamentally and therefore I have the same fundamental compassion for both. Sometimes I have to turn that on myself as I'm not immune to the power of force either.
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:22:06
Yea highly doubt a crash will happen, but they are selling them somewhere so the price will in theory come down.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:13:15
Your post was titled, "Joe Rogan finally goes bitcoin. Posts this to FB."
Joe Rogan had not "gone bitcoin", unless "going bitcoin" means mentioning it off-handed in a conversation.
Joe Rogan did not post the meme to his facebook page like your title suggests.
Maybe you're joking now though.
Either way, you started a great conversation that played a part in Andreas being on the podcast, which worked out cool.
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:34:35
Not exactly sure which episode. From my recollection, it has always been a guest that brings it up and Joe basically says, "I know nothing about bitcoin, but it could be cool".
The meme did ring a bell though, so I don't think it was a misquote, just a misrepresentation.
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:25:17
Exactly. This was a offhanded comment that he made. He does 2-3 podcasts a week where he often talks about global issues and he's never seriously had a discussion about bitcoin.
Once he shows that he is moderately educated on the subject or has a bitcoin expert on the podcast I'll say he's "gone bitcoin".
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:27:13
This line of thinking is completely absurd to anyone working for the government. To them, force is inevitable so let's put it in the hands of the "good guys".
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:26:59
You might want to watch the video again. He's not talking about the price of bitcoin. He's talking about bitcoin getting water-down into a decentralized version of paypal that doesn't solve any of the problems it was created to solve.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:25:26
He sent this tweet shorty after, which suggests that he will have Andreas on - 
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:58:48
Cool post, glad to see bitcoin is taking off in these types of communities. Where you have similar types of entrepreneurs using bitcoin, there is a chance to form a real economy around bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:26:43
Yes, Andreas would be awesome on that show.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:53:41
Well come on then. You can't make all those statements based off what you see on reddit. Bitcoin has reached far beyond reddit. Dogecoin was created by reddit culture.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:21:45
Yea, that's the nature of rules.
It'd be nice if we could leave it up to the communities. I guess the fear is that every decent-sized subreddit would turn to shit with these types of posts. Probably a valid fear, but there has to be a better solution then an inflexible rule.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:09:56
How so?
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:28:19
This image is pointless. What website is it from? What time period does that volume represent? What exchanges is it pulling data from?
7293 BTC volume for bitcoin is incredibly low. I'm looking at  right now and there has been over 27K BTC volume in the last 24 hrs.
Stop trying to make dogecoin something it isn't yet. It's a great idea and I hope it is successful, but that's no reason to spread bs like this.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:14:52
Nope, don't mean that at all. It's just not a credible source of information without the website it came from, the time period that the numbers represent, and a list of exchanges that are being used to calculate the volume. Don't you think any of this information matters when trying to prove your point?
Day in an day out, bitcoin does more volume that dogecoin. Don't point to one single image of context-less data like it proves something.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:44:57
Ah gotcha. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:30:23


If that is true, awesome, but I'd have to see some data to back it up.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:58:16
I have no idea what you think I am trying to say.
Someone suggested that if "full time tech guys" at flexcoin can't keep their bitcoins safe, how is a regular person supposed to keep their bitcoins safe.
My point was that these two scenarios have nothing to do with each other. Regular people do not have a big target on their back like a centralized bitcoin bank. Additionally, an individual should know that web wallets are not safe and should only put in bitcoin they are willing to risk.
If you don't agree with that, then fuck me.
@_date: 2014-05-24 05:25:30
Seriously. We can learn a lot from old people.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:41:41
The point is that putting a small amount of bitcoin in a web/app wallet is safe if you do it right and has nothing to do with what the "full-time tech folks" at flexcoin were doing.
@_date: 2014-09-25 22:11:55
They really are. Their "LTB" coin is showing how communities can use cryptocurrency to drive content creation and revenue sharing.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:46:47
Agreed. He broke a rule and that rule is there for a reason, but he did not break the rule in the spirit in which it was written. It'd be cool if reddit would implement some polling features or other metric that would let you know how many voted in general. It would open up a lot of possibilities.
@_date: 2014-01-15 14:28:50
Rogan didn't make that picture. He just said this one line about bitcoin and someone created the meme. I believe he did retweet the meme which is cool.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:33:11
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:41:43
I have no idea how you are defining risk. In one scenario you are risking a single satoshi and in another you are risking thousands of bitcoin. I don't see how that is the same. Not to mention that the more bitcoin you have in a wallet, the more likely it will be stolen assuming all other factors are the same.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:20:56
Yea, I'd need to see data for that too. Bitcoin is a multi-billion market cap, doge coin is in the millions.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:24:24
Haha o yea, now that you say that I wasn't able to fill it out either.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:34:50
I think the simple response to this is that none of it is easy. I'm guessing running reddit with the staff they have now is insane. Doing all of this stuff means lots of risk. That being said, a simple way to mitigate that risk would be to simply ask redditors what they want. I've been on reddit for 3-4 years now and I think I've filled out 1 survey for the admins. I mean come on.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:26:02
No, it's not comfortable and yes it completely diminishes the accolade.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:06:30
Sweet, thanks for the info/link.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:56:46
I just checked and with coinbase you can setup the recurring payment in USD.
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:54:15
To be clear, I think the video/advertisement is interesting. I have no idea about the actual website/service.
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:26:02
I'm certainly making some assumptions when I say "once it is fully adopted" for the purpose of the question and discussion.
Feel free to define "importance". I'm not looking for one absolute answer.
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:01:26
Yes absolutely. What I meant to say was, "Is this as bad as it looks?".
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:14:28
So if prohibition of BTC was put into effect and for some reason illegal use of BTC mirrored illegal cannabis use, 42.4% of the population would use BTC once in their lifetime. I wouldn't call that anything close to "full adoption".
@_date: 2013-06-13 19:54:20
@_date: 2013-05-29 02:20:06
Right? I mean if the US govt made bitcoin illegal, that would suck because it would prevent widespread adoption and stifle bitcoin's ability to reach it's full potential. But they can't stop people from using it completely.
@_date: 2013-09-10 04:17:15
Good luck!
Awesome idea!
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:06:53
Alright, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:28:06
Thanks for the vid, I hadn't seen that. Really glad to see that he brought up the top voted comment on his thread. This reddit thing isn't rocket science. I hope other leaders can see that and emulate.
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:31:57
I don't know about the credentials of the individual who posts the top comment, but economics obviously falls under the umbrella of social science.
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:52:34
To hear a company talk so nonchalantly about buying illegal drugs in an advertisement is interesting. As for there actual site and service, I have no idea.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:18:15
Yes, full adoption was the wrong words. My point is that the US government can prevent btc from being used widely in America. Trying to cite the inefficacy of marijuana prohibition as a reason to believe the govt cant hurt btc is poor reasoning.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:05:07
All I have seen is politicians doing AMAs during their campaigns or promoting their pet-issue de jour. If you have a link to another example like this I'd love to check it out.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:11:15
Have some tea on me. Good luck!

Another attempt to control what gets upvoted in this subreddit. Good luck with that as this post fades away like every other post.
is not what it used to be. Deal with it and move on.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:49:21
Nice site, hadn't see that yet.
I love the AMAs and think politicians should keep doing them. I think this thing with Sen. Moran was unique and important because he came to reddit to learn about something, not for redditors to learn about him. That is something that is rare in politician AMAs.
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:54:02
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:53:43
Yea. A pretty small percentage of the population uses illegal drugs.
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:03:45
thanks for the info
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:29:11
I really wish reddit would implement a handicapping feature for image posts that could be turned on for any subreddit. This would weigh down image posts, making it harder for them to reach the top of the page. It would eliminate a lot of the low-quality memes without having to resort to banning memes.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:08:41
Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2013-04-28 14:43:15
I'd love to see a Flattr button on that page!
