Dude. If you have to deal with blowback on a price fall from half your office, all that says to me is that you weren't giving careful, qualified advice in the run-up. Nobody I know is talking shit because when I introduce them to crypto, I stress fundamentals like understanding the technology of the asset you're looking at, the extreme volatility, even market cap and how it relates to present value created by the networks and future opportunity. Also my own ignorance on crypto-assets I don't know much about at all. A correction like this shouldn't be a surprise to you or especially any newcomers you've spoken to.

A lot of people in the bitcoin community view the Fed as a model of overreach and meddling. What superfetatoire was getting at is that where many might have anticipated some sort of authoritative overreach (or signal of it) from the Fed, what we got instead was an unequivocal statement that the Fed had zero authority to regulate bitcoin in any way. 
Basically many in the community fear Fed overreach, and the Fed's statements went in the opposite direction.
She also clearly voiced that a major concern with bitcoin (money laundering) is already being dealt with and that FinCen doesn't need additional legal powers to stop it; the laws already on the books are good enough.
So to summarize, you've got the Fed (public enemy  for many in the community, right or wrong) saying
* We have no authority to regulate Bitcoin
* We don't need new laws to combat the money-laundering fears
* Mr. Congressman, if you feel you need to do more, feel free to talk amongst yourselves. 
Seemed a pretty sane and reasonable response to me.

But you know what? Shrugging your shoulders and saying "regulators gonna regulate" and leaving it at that doesn't get us where we need to be.
Because the fact is that regulation is one of the single largest factors in Bitcoin's adoption that exists. Of course regulation exists, and is going to exist, but you can't leave it at that. You need to confront it intelligently address it, or else you may not end up getting what you want in the end.

I don't quite see that. 
If you believe that bitcoin has the long term ability to not just append, but *replace* the major payment rails, then his position makes sense and has a lot of merit. ApplePay [isn't just a means of an iOS device talking with a terminal]( if they are taking fees and it is a revenue stream for them. If this is the case, a long-on-bitcoin scenario sees the same pressures coming to bear on ApplePay as on the traditional rails. 
The threat bitcoin poses is driving the cost of transferring money to near zero.

There is a massive amount of regulation stifling the start up space that needs to be addressed, and outfits like this only serve to make addressing meaningful and sane regulatory reform that much more difficult.

Sour grapes from their beef with Apple's App Store rejecting wallets for a period of time is my guess.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:24:55
I don't agree. I feel that bad actors like this *strengthen* the case for more regulation. 
Do you think that those seeking addt'l regulation (enforcement) feel like they have enough tools in their toolbox? I don't. I believe that in the course of their investigations, they are all too aware of what they *can't* do with the tools they have. I bet they are all too aware of what addt'l powers and regulation they wish they could realize to make their objectives more attainable.
And for those drafting and passing such legislation, -who are they going to listen to? The enforcement community that has been using the tools they gave them and guided them on, or...um...the pretty much nobody else that is lobbying against giving them these tools?
There is **so much** that needs to be done in the regulatory space in order to keep what regulation we already have from stifling this fledgling technology and give traditional payments rails some real transformative competition and disruption. But it's an uphill battle decades in the making, and outfits like these do *tremendous* damage to Bitcoin from not just a PR perspective, but a regulatory one as well, and most boots on the ground enthusiasts that aren't trying to start companies in the space have *no idea* how much sloppy, overly-broad regulation is hurting their cause  at the moment. 
Fine tuning it is going supremely difficult. Balancing the needs of the state while not cutting the legs off of the technology itself is not easy right now and it isn't going to get easy anytime soon. The state is going to always err on the conservative side when there is a balancing act (conservative being overly broad regulation). A sequence of illegal marketplaces like this popping up like the heads of a hydra *isn't* making the case for less regulation, or even more *nuanced* regulation, at least one of which is needed if not both.

1.  App can be coded to transmit or transfer virtual currencies from one location to another over a network or device.
2. Approved by Apple per App Store rules.
3. Up to the collective union of states and federal government, along with the opinion of the user. I'm sure some will find the regulation enacted by various governments burdensome, others not so much,  and still others will find the burdens creates an opportunity. This just sounds like Apple saying "We're not going to allow our platform to facilitate illegal activity." Considering one of the main concerns (of regulators) with bitcoin is money laundering, it is not surprising that Apple would have language like this in their TOS given the class of crimes they *potentially* could be dealing with on their platform. Don't want to be messing with FinCEN. Seems reasonable to me.

No doubt. I was just musing on the fact that a lot of the adoption is marketing driven vs. utility driven, which, I think, is worth thinking on if one is interested in the ecosystem. This is just one manifestation of that, but you see it quite a bit lately. Just interesting to me.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:47:29
I certainly agree that with Apple's model, they could transition ApplePay from a revenue stream to mere value-add for their platform. They certainly employ that strategy elsewhere to good effect. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:09:40


I think it has more to do with marketing than the value of the dogecoin currency. Hot sauces are trending right now, and the market for specialty hot sauces is growing (I almost said "heating up" kill me now). Sriracha is basically an *internet meme*. 
I think if you did market and demographic research, you'd find that there is probably some pretty good overlap between internet savvy dudes into dogecoin and other tech/crypto news, and hot sauce buyers. Not even kidding. 
So basically, I think that it was just some dead-on marketing for an online hot-sauce vendor to advertise that he's taking doge. More of a reflection on astute marketing than the utility and value of the dogecoin ecosystem, -at least in this case.

It was a range of services, including iCloud, Dropbox, and email from what I understand, and passwords were likely gotten via social engineering, phishing, and non rate-limited guessing, though I have not actually seen confirmation on the methods (these are just the top three methods this ring of traders used).
I'm guessing Apple is getting the brunt because automated iCloud backups are not something most people understand, and inadvertently made celebrity Apple users a disproportionately large percentage of the desirable targets because while the users thought they had permanently erased their photos, they had not, in reality. Combine that with being the largest tech company in the world, and it's not hard to see why the range and platform of attacks seems to be being glossed over in favor of focus on Apple. Some of it is deserved. Whether the method is used or not, guessing your password should be rate-limited, there is no question. Even if you get 10 guesses, it's better than infinite. A lot of commentary and reporting is missing the big picture here though. Slomething as simple as headlines calling this the "iCloud hack" seem to miss the point to me.

I get that ;) and my point was that the most likely answers are just that, -the most likely answers. Given that they actively added pro-crypto currency language to their TOS, I think it's reasonable to assume that they are looking to facilitate wallet apps that comply with state and federal laws. I really do think transmit means what we think transmit means, and approved means what we think approved means. The third is the thorniest one, mostly because devs may have to take into account a changing patchwork of laws. Hard to read this as anything but good intent with reasonable CYO legalize from where I am.

As soon as I saw that from an employee and not part of an official blog post that set off bells for me. My first though was "disgruntled employee leaks" which didn't seem to be the case, so I just ended on "what a horribly poor way for Reddit to communicate information on a potential future product to its users".
Looks like Reddit may have felt the same way about the latter...
@_date: 2016-03-25 19:46:12


I think the issue is that it was NOT being solved quickly, and when the issue involves money being siphoned directly out of your checking account, I think the quick response that never materialized was to be deserved. The response he received was *abysmal*.
I get that this is a new space and Coinbase as a startup is hitting the ground running, but that doesn't let them off the hook for slow, uncommunicative responses to *missing money*. The bar is higher. This isn't the same as wondering where the HDMI cable I ordered off Amazon is, and in any event, Amazon would do a better job of telling me immediately than Coinbase often does. 
I've been frustrated more than once by not only by material errors in their service, but the support that was offered in the wake of them.  
Edit: None of this is to say that Coinbase isn't generally a good service, because it is. Coincidentally, CB just sent me a survey asking how they were doing and would I recommend them, and my feedback was much the same as what I said here. I gave them a 7/10, and opined that while they were one of the best services out there, I feel that is because there simply is not a lot of competition, and their errors and support have been fairly noteworthy in how anemic they are in my exp. In general though, to be fair, it's at the top of the list of services in the space I'd recommend to a new user, but again that isn't saying as much as it could be. There is *substantial* room for improvement with Coinbase both on the product and service side. They have a long way to go while at the same time recognizing they've also come farther than most.
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:56:43
I think the regulatory landscape and risk was too fraught for their available resources, combined with the realities of using the technology to design an actual *good product with value for the community*.

Not missing the point at all. I'm sure he's a stand up guy!
But the fact remains that it is near impossible for a bitcoin company to establish a stable banking relationship. Compare that with how easy it is for his (or any other) bank to acquire another customer that will live up the the expectations of the bank as a customer. That's just called a normal banking customer. If either party is lucky to have a relationship with the other, it's first and foremost Coinsetter, -even with Jarod being an awesome guy. There's no shortage of awesome, capable, mature, and honest entrepreneurs in the space trying unsuccessfully to establish a banking relationship.  
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:45:58


We already know what gets tipped the highest/most though. upvotes and gold are analogs to that.
I have yet to see or hear of a proposal that uses blockchain technology to add value to a Reddit product, and I'm a huge fan of bitcoin. 
You can't just wedge in a new technology for the hell of it, or because you think it's cool, or even because you think it's the future. You have to integrate it into an *actual useful value-adding product* that works for your community *and* furthers your organizational objectives. *Totally* not seeing that yet here.
I thought you were actually joking with your smorgasbord of ideas for Reddit to look at, and were going to make the point that they actually need to *not* chase those down and pare down and focus like a laser on their core mission. 
They're the "front page of the internet". They need to get better at serving ads, gathering demographic data, and improving the ability of the platform to do what users really want to do on it (your search example is a great one). 
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:10:30

@_date: 2015-01-23 16:44:02
I assure you it's the other way around. The relationship Coinsetter has with their bank is one of the single most valuable assets it possesses. The value of assets like banking relationships will decrease over time as bitcoin becomes more mainstream and financial institutions develop better understanding and more accurate risk-models of bitcoin businesses. Right now though, Coinsetter is *extremely* fortunate (I won't say lucky because there is zero doubt that securing stable banking was a tremendous amount of work) to have a banking partner at all. No surprise it's overseas either...
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:55:19
In what states (if any) are you licensed as a money transmitter in the US, and if you are, do you hold the licence or is it a delegate relationship?
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:10:01
Sure there are differences, but they are roughly analogs of each other. So you have to ask if the goal is to know which posts get the most love, upvotes, gold, and a tip are basically telling you the same thing. So that can't be why you shift to tipping.
So that brings you to someplace else, where the goal is to deliver a product to your users that they find valuable and delivers value to the org.


See I don't see that as a value-add at all there. That's too vague and doesn't mean anything to me.
A value add for me would look something like the problem you're addressing in  Gold can't be re-gifted and has no value (not entirely true, it does offer value in the form of features, but there might be greater value for the user if they could spend it easily elsewhere). 
Reddit is so big, it's fun to imagine if people could easily tip in btc, you could get situations where a clever comment or cool post could take off to the front page and all of a sudden that person would could get slammed with thousands of dollars in distributed tips. Pretty cool and fun to think about. But as soon as you start looking at something like this you see all the potential problems. It could warp the dynamics of the site where people comment and post strictly with the goals of making money. Karmawhoring to the tenth power. Also, shifting from gold to btc may create value for the users, but it could very well be *destroying* value for Reddit as an org. And then there's the regulatory burdens, Know Your Customer banking regulations, state by state licensing, and all of the costs and risks that come with being a platform that transfers value like that. Is your cool idea even feasible with the resources you have? How many millions stacked on millions does Reddit have to even comply with regulations and roll out tipping legally? And how would you even *onboard* Reddit's vast user base to a digital currency from a UIX persepective. The closer you look at these things, the more herculean they can become. Nailing the product design, having the resources to be regulatory compliant in the Fintech space, creating an actual product that adds value and doesn't inadvertently harm the site. The list goes on.  Can of worms this idea, and again, never saw a promising use case that was clearly beneficial to both Reddit as an org and it's users at the same time. 
I think they are better served by keeping it simple, improving the site for what users want to do on it, and focusing on selling ads more intelligently. I do think there is fertile ground for doing a better job connecting people on the site outside of the subreddit format.

@_date: 2016-03-25 20:03:53


I think this is an important and valid point to make. I give Coinbase a certain amount of leeway taking into account that they are a startup navigating a very new space. I think that's fair. A lot of this leeway manifests in the trust I've extended by handing over a kidney's worth of personal info and a direct link to my bank account to an unproven young company with a small team. But this trust can only extend so far. When they as a company are not responding with the utmost promptness to missing funds from accounts, that's not acceptable no matter what size you are and how small your "agile" startup team is, and if they won't communicate quickly on an issue like this then customers should absolutely be taking it to the community in *every* case.  
If a company wants to offer bootstrap startup levels of customer service in response to thousands of missing dollars then being policed by the community it serves is the *least* that should be expected. Because that level of service in response to missing funds is unacceptable, and if they think otherwise, eventually they will lose their customers to a service that knows better. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:58:31
If you won't answer the question of what bank you use (and you won't), can you explain to the community *why* you won't?
There are very good business reasons why you (and your competitors) won't disclose this, and it might be informative for the community if you talk about why on this front.

Key point.  
Their robust KYC controls are a regulatory requirement with existential penalties if not taken seriously.

Yeah...requesting upvotes is precisely NOT what you're supposed to do on Reddit.   
Additionally, trying to fuel a speculative bubble isn't really worthy of an upvote brigade. There has been nothing long term or structurally significant in the space that justifies the recent spike in many people's eyes.  
When real progress and breakthroughs with the blockchain develop, that's newsworthy. This, not so much.

I've not seen terribly many people argue that they are the same. They are clearly very different platforms with differentiated costs and benefits. From an *openness* perspective though, I'd say it's a fairly easy case to make that most people give Google far more credit than they deserve on that end. Google only opened and contributed to AOSP to protect their bottom line. Now that they have achieved market penetration, AOSP development is drying up as Google reasserts control over the ecosystem via their application offerings. In a few years AOSP will just be a decade old outdated framework, -an unsupported poor alternative to what Google or other market players will be offering.

Eh, I didn't even click it because he wasn't even responding with a coherent argument. Didn't realize his comment was even less useful than I suspected. 
*Sigh*. Gotta love the internet sometimes. 
My point regarding the NSA and threats in general still stands though. When evaluating security of a platform, all threats are *not* equal, and you should prioritize them and make your choices accordingly. For BTC, malware is a much larger threat than say, the NSA or other state actor.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:21:47


They're not invalid. Threat assessment is a core competency of antivirus firms. My point is that just because a firm is for profit, it doesn't instantly negate all information provided by them. They are just one firm/org among many that have issued security assessments on Android. I'm not here to split hairs.


I've been very clear in pointing out that it is up to individual users to make their own threat assesment, and very clearly detailing the most important factors for me personally. 
I've been even keeled, and non inflamatory, and polite to obvious trolls  (not referring to you, btw) while giving my point of view. You may disagree with my conclusions, but I have not been spreading misinformation nor have I been scare mongering. Choosing a platform with less malware, app review, and quicker &amp; more widely distributed security patches is not an unreasonable choice to make if one is concerned with security. 
You may disagree. That is fine. But please, let's keep the hyperbole and re-framing of what other people are saying down to a minimum and just agree that we can reach different conclusions *both* for valid reasons, alright?
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:44:50
This is starting to turn into an Apple vs Google thing, which I'm *definintely* not interested in. 
I'll just reiterate that I personally prefer iOS from a security standpoint, and share the opinion that [Google is hostile to open Android]( and do not agree that they've never restricted the freedom of their customers. 
They are certainly more open than Apple, as I've said many times, though that's not hard to do. Assigning morality to either company is folly imho. Both companies do many things that are good for users, as well as things that are not. 
This isn't black and white, and we aren't rooting for sports teams. We could go back and forth all day. For every "Apple is evil cause closed" argument you can make, you can say "Google is evil because privacy". On Google's platform, [*you are the product*]( much more so than on Apple's. I personally have a problem with that. Does that mean you have to? Of course not. Does that mean Google is automatically evil? Again, assigning morality to for profit firms is folly. What I can say is that that platform choice isn't black and white, and users need to choose based on their priorities and values...priorities and values that *differ* from person to person. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:07:48


I thought this had been clarified enough already but...
It isn't misinformation. Android malware is up 40% according to Trend Micro (cue the cries of conflict of interests). 
Additionally, it seems odd to me that you would shoehorn the idea that it *isn't* growing by artifically removing one of the most populated markets in the world (China) from the equation. *Especially* when it is precisely this country that is, by volume, one of the biggest drivers of BTC itself. 
But that's fine I guess if you're making a personal calculation regarding what platform to choose for yourself and security. It goes beyond the fact that malware both exists and is flourishing on Android. The Android ecosystem is notoriously bad for pushing security updates (thanks carriers) out to phones, and even Google itself doesn't support upgrades as long as iOS does. 
For myself, I choose iOS because of the comparative derth of malware, the app review process, the fact that security patches are pushed out more quickly across more of the platform, and even for the additional security via lower marketshare, which is a real effect. 
At the end of the day, it is up to the user to prioritize and asses the security landscape for himself and make the best decision. There are a plethora of security reason that inform my choice, and depsite your accusing me of spreading misinformation, I was not wrong when I said Android malware is growing at a large rate, nor was I wrong when I said that iOS had comparatively little malware. You could make an argument that Android malware is not too bad from specific app stores in certain market subsets, and that users in those regions don't have to worry as much, but that is a different statment than saying I was spreading misinformation about the increase in Android malware.

I didn't deny anything genjix. I merely pointed out that you failed to make an argument that had anything to do with the point I made, and instead just resorted to what amounts to a personal attack. I actually responded to the substance of what I can only *guess* your point was (since you didn't actually articulate one), being that the NSA has compromised the iOS platform in certain ways, therefore it is not secure. Again, that is only a guess as to what you were getting at because you didn't actually make your case, -you just posted a link to a trollish picture.

genjix, this is where we disagree. What you see as abuse, I see as being good stewards and taking care of users, for the specific reasons I listed above. 
Maybe you do not see it that way. That is fine. 
But please realize that there are other more open choices on the market. Apple offers a more secure, safe ecosystem for its users if they are willing to forgo some selection. That is a very clear security benefit to many many users, myself included. 


This comment has me wondering if you are a troll. Seriously. You're walking a fine line, so I'll just ignore it and answer your other points seriously. 


This is a giant can of worms, as "free and open" are very nebulous terms that mean very different things to many different people, but I'll just reiterate that "closed" ecosytems like Apple's can be very pro-user for the reasons I listed, and if your priorities are aligned differently, a more open alternative makes good sense.

And of course, the NSA overreach is much worse than this in scope, to an appalling degree, touching the networks of every major carrier, backbone delivery systems, hardware manufacturers, BIOS level components, social networks, email and communications systems, etc. The list goes on, far beyond what most people are comfortable acknowledging. 
My question is what does this have to do with what I just said? Honestly am curious. All things being equal, the NSA is a threat across all platforms, so if your argument is that if a platform can be breached by them it is not usable, then you just have to stop using computers period. I don't think that's a very useful line of reasoning, especially for the average BTC user, who does not need to fear the NSA stealing their BTC. I'm more concerned with unscrupulous malware authors doing that. So I just don't understand the argument you're trying to make here. Maybe you could actually make it instead of just linking to a random fact about the NSA's capabilities? If you do, please bear in mind that I already pointed out that iOS App store security is not absolute. That's not an argument I was making.

As it does I. This seems to be a nebulous overreaction to a situation nobody knows the facts of. 
r/Bitcoin doesn't seem to have a particularly good grasp on the myriad of reasons there are for apps to be rejected every single day. The only thing crazier than jumping on the bandwagon after hearing only one side of the story is jumping on the bandwagon when that one side *didn't even give a story*.
As you mentioned, there are a plethora of BTC apps on iOS, and there will only be more in the future. 
The debate about Apple being a walled garden is a fine one to have. One thing I find mildly interesting there is that BTC users are some of the most hyper-vigilent people on the planet when it comes to security. This is actually why I prefer iOS to Android personally. I sacrifice a bit of choice in exchange for greater security. Apples App review process and ecosystem has thus far resulted in a platform that is comparatively devoid of malware, while it is growing by leaps and bounds on Android.
This goes beyond concerns just about BTC, -phones in general contain so much sensitive information, and the bottom line is that iOS's track record on malware is just better. 
Some people's philosophical sentiments dictate that this tradeoff isn't worth it, and others still would make a case that Android is somehow *in theory* still safer (tenuous imho), but I see iOS as a platform as offering something unique in terms of security compared to it's more "open" (I use that term loosely) counterpart. I appreciate that extra bit of security (and yes, I know it is neither absolute and can be worked around, as any scenario is).  I'm a *bit* surprised that this practical stance isn't embraced a bit more here, though maybe I shouldn't be. The "open" vs "closed" debate pushes a lot of the same buttons BTC itself does for many people.

My argument has zero to do with convenience, but rather security vs. selection. 
Apple's platform has less malware than say, Android, due to its app review process and stricter guidelines. These same guidelines cause apps with security issues to be rejected as well as other app that simply run afoul of the rules that have nothing to do with security. 
So I'll say it again. From a user security point of view, Apple's iOS platform provides a much safer environment from a malware perspective at the expense of choice.
The largest "more open" mobile OS competitor is Android. The number of instances of malware on Android is much greater directly because of the lack of oversight and lax guidelines. It is a greater security threat and less secure from this perspective. The upside is that as a user, you get greater choice. As a developer you can offer functionality to your users not available on iOS.
That is the argument I made. It has everything to do with the tension between security and choice. 
Please do not purposely re-frame my choices made for security reasons as ones made out of convenience. It is disingenuous, and represents the worst of what conversing with strangers on the net can devolve into. People who take their security seriously make conscious choices about what software environments to operate in for very specific reasons.
