Hasn’t been backed by gold for quite some time now. It’s given value because we collect taxes in it.

Crows are super intelligent. They can remember faces and will follow and attack people who steal from them.

Yup. And you might check out this link where it talks about citizens being made to turn over privately owned gold for a fixed price. Once the government had all the gold, then they raised the price and made private gold ownership legal again after a period of time.

You know you can predict which shitcoin will get pumped that day by aggregating information, right?  It's not just a guessing game.  Also, shill or not, discounting someone because they are young is kind of shitty, no?  Young people shouldn't try to hustle and make money, and if they do, they need to tell the world about it on reddit from day one or they are fake?  This is my first post in the Bitcoin sub, I better not find any kind of success with cryptos or I'll be a shill too.
