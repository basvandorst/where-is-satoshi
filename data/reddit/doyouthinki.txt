Hahahahahahahhahaha.  What are smoking.  There are no "reserves."  All of Venezuela's oil production for the next 20 years has already been promised as collateral for previous loans/bonds/etc.  There is zero chance you will ever get a penny back from the "collateral."  Once the Maduro regime is toppled, the new government will laugh at people asking, "But what about mah Petros????"

And commodities exchanges in the USA and Europe aren't 100% backed by the whims of a dictator, my friend.  I know you get my point.

Hahaha.  Like all those contractual bonds Maduro is defaulting on?  Maybe they'll promise extra, extra, extra hard not to default on the oil this new "contractually-backed" Petro!!!!!  I would max out my credit cards if Madura double-triple promises that this contract will be different than all the others he's reneged on.

Whole country?  Are you referring to vast majority of Venezuelans who don't even own a computer or how to use one?  Do you predict the local grocery stores and shops will start using crypocurrency for flour and blue jeans?  If/when Maduro starts paying government employees in Petros, what happens to the value of the Petro when he declares a increase minimum wage in couple months and the people see a magical increase in the number of Petros in their "paychecks"?  Where did those new magical petros come from?

The oil is in Maduro's hands.  There is no 3rd party to give you the oil directly my friend.
