except that would give away our special sauce and leave us with no hardware still.
most security works through obscurity, releasing source code for the backend could jeopardize that.
this is being developed with or without interest/approval
whether the amount of hardware needed to operate on a large scale is acquirable is another story and will depend on the community. mostly in the sense of is it a worthwhile investment wanted by the community, an IPO would require more trust then can be given for an anonymous CEO, so the only option is self-investment/donation.

no one is going to trust someone known, for fear that they get all their shit seized and jailed.
