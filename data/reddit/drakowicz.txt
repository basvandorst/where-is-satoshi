Experts think most coins they hold will experience a +3000% rise within a few months. Or very soon.

FFS i've been waiting for a money transfer from my bank to kraken for a week now. Right now i just received the mail from Kraken telling me it's available and i notice ""this"".  And obviously tons of people are having heart attacks and withdrawing everything rn since Kraken is down AGAIN.
Anyway i think i can buy some btc for cheap now and hope for a new rise.

Do you think that poor guy had a stroke a few weeks ago? 
edit: nevermind, he's posting here. Are you ok Greg? You must be devastated.

YEAH I COULD. 
OR MAYBE NOT.

Watch out OP. You'll have to pay one buck for taxes. You're living it up.

OverClocking. Over the Counter.

"Fuck me"? We don't know if the drop is going to go further. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:58
Thanks. 
I heard the sudden down trend is because of some whales suddenly withdrawing tons of money. But heh, maybe it's going to be a good thing for altcoins although ltc and eth are experiencing drops too. 
I just learned what a "bear market" is. I hope what we're seeing now is a correction and not a bear market.

D-D-D-DON'T MAKE ME TICKLE THE PANIC BUTTON. I really feel like doing it. BUT I MUST RESIST.

Same. My bank forced me to wait 3 painful days before i could send money to a new account. I was cursing them all day long but now i must thank them for this.

Probably why i'm going to buy at 13k now. Am i half noob then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:44
Yup, that sounds more reasonable. I've been looking at some graphs and the price evolutions are completely fucked up, i think i'll keep my fiat bucks for now.

I'm not sure yet if i'm going to turn them into euros. Maybe i'll do that, or maybe i'll invest more. I just want to make sure i'll be ready when i'll have to do that.
Or maybe i'll invest more and wait until profit then turn everything back into euros. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:32:12
I'm a complete noob and a bit afraid of buying now. Maybe it's the right time to get some btc. But what if it's not a correction, and it's going to drop even more? (half-serious question)

Hi, complete bitcoin noob here. I had 2€ worth of bitcoin one year ago. Now those 2€ turned into 89€.  
Considering "what happened recently", i'm going to invest a little bit. 
What should i use to turn BTC into €uros? I heard Wirex is good. 
If i want to invest in btc/buy bitcoins, where should i go? I'm on Blockchain, should i buy bitcoins there or use a trading site like Etoro? I can't use Coinbase btw.

Bold of you to assume that replacing old fiats by a new digital currency is going to free you.
