some of us _might've_ exited positions at the top and held from single digits. some of us traded btc for weird things before exchanges even existed. some of us knew this would happen from the beginning, because some armchair maths based on potential capture of market share and market cap in 2011 could tell you where the price was potentially heading. 
some of us are waiting for the price to catch up with the next halvening: Estimated time of bitcoin block reward halving: Tue May 19 14:01:37 2020 UTC | Time remaining: 45 weeks, 1 day, 0 hours, 40 minutes, and 0 seconds.

Coming from an individual who has had the pleasure of dealing with IM as a reseller for about a decade or so... we started finding better...faster deals elsewhere a few years back. Like Newegg and TigerDirect, etc.
IM is slow as shit sometimes. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to wait. This request probably fallout from recent bitinstant events, maybe.

While I'm familiar with that event also, I do not remember observing myself or others using the term in the wild "to be goxxed" or "goxxing" prior to the event Mr. Ben Deez speaks of above, but maybe I'm just old and can't remember *slash* don't care anymore. With that in mind, I concede defeat in every way imaginable. Understand it probably mostly took multiple goxxings to truly understand what "goxxing" was.

FWIW I liquidated in January and have about a year's worth of salary in taxes to pay to the taxman this year, because I bought and sold 6 or 7 figures worth of BTC on AML/KYC currency exchanges as the price was falling from it's ATH.
I cashed out a considerable amount to USD and fully expect to comply with all taxable gains. There are websites that can assist with computing gains/losses from the exported reports from the exchanges, YMMV.
Stay off-market. Enjoy the ride to the bottom. See ya'll in 2020.

I'll talk to Eleuthria (that's the owner of BTCGuild) and make sure I have a clear understanding of payouts, per hour, etc.
I mine there myself and I believe you are due, or rather, BTCGuild is paying your worker for shares you submitted for a period of time including AND after the 2 hour time period in which the shares were submitted. Pool payouts usually happen sharewise for a period of time going forward to reward you for low variance. 
Pool payouts and distributions have evolved a good bit and hopefully I explained why that is above.
The expected generation output, at 240000.0 Mhps, given difficulty of 707408283.051, is 0.170619381813 BTC per day and 0.00710914090886 BTC per hour.
Someone else reported .007/hour iirc and that looks correct.
Under optimal circumstances, your worker would receive roughly .014 btc for 2 hours of mining at 240GH/s. I would not, however expect that .014 btc to be due after the two hours was up, the payout would trickle in according to the pool's payout distribution.

I don't see it skyrocketing in value, because the value is unknown. I see decimal places moving in currencies whose value is totally misunderstood in the first place due to historically inflationary policies. Policies so fiscally irresponsible that it will be ironic that the only way possible one day to buy your way out of trillions of dollars of debt might just be magic deflationary internet money coming to bail your ass out.
The only reason this can even be possible is fungibilty. You just keep moving the decimals as adoption and scarcity demand it. To do this in the real world with real currency requires real resources, resources of some kind whether the money is paper or in bank's computer. 1 million US dollars is only 100 million US units of measure. 
So if it isn't bitcoin that changes some of these problems:
What's a distributed, fault-tolerant computational network that competes, no, votes on consistency to verify a ledger worldwide worth? Keep in mind though, that as a function of time, it gets computationally harder to add to this ledger. 
What can you do with that?
Can you use it as commodity that can be traded against? A data point to measure other data points by?
Can you use it as a currency that provides liquidity between parties to agree on a measure of value? Money is liquidity.
Can public servants use it and be publicly audited and accountable? I mean seriously, where in the current banking system is simply getting the ledger entries correct rewarded with the ability to add more entries in the ledger at your discretion? The concept of rewarding the person that verifies the validity of the money/ledger itself is revolutionary.  Mining, chaining transactions/ledgers entries together with crypto signing is revolutionary. 
Can elections be held that are undeniable and unquestionably verifiable?
How about patents and document verification and signing? Can events and digital content be "chained" to a moment in time forever?
It's fun to use it as money, don't get me wrong. But the value is either one of two things: 0 or limitless, imho. The worldwide trend is distrust in systems that have historically failed or cheated the participants. 
_why wouldn't_ it skyrocket in value?
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:18:29
needs more info on which pool and what's the payout but generally mining contracts are unprofitable for buyer.
some pools take hours, days or weeks to actually pay for submitted shares or block generation.
he could have sold you two hours of 240GH/s on a pool that didn't solve a block, that doesn't pay unless it gets blocks while your worker is mining.
here's some old examples of what i'm talking about:
both of these are defunct but gpumax and hashpower were both meta-pools where you both buy and sell your hashpower for a PPS rate.
why would anyone do that?
because this was back when 500GH/s was a shit ton. launch a 500GH/s worker out of the blue on a nice, big, dripping wet proportional pool and voila! you may have just hit the lottery my friend. you are now that largest slice of that payout pie. generally speaking though, everyone is trying to win the lottery mining and normally you lose out on leased hashpower.
variance is a bitch, but it's a curve. the guy on top varies less. 240GH/s is a drop in the bucket; a hobbiest miner.
things are different these days, 2 hours doesn't really account for variance or all pool distribution and payout methods.
need more info to make an informed decision on whether or not you were scammed or not, but maybe.

I hate to shatter realities here, but the monies used to purchase the bitcoins are devaluing because they are not scarce. The utility is the same.
personally, I think it takes the market some time to both realize and value the scarcity. kinda like mining diff skyrocketing and 30-90 day window post scarcity for price reaction.
i follow the diff, the txn volume, and bid/ask ratios on every exchange daily.  the trend is up in all regards, the resource is scarce, the market is far from penetrated.

I realize I'm about to get downvoted to hell, but some of us figured out anything requiring mining in the current sense doesn't scale past earth thing a few years ago.
something entirely made up like ripple might be able to unite (through liquidity) the chained, mined currencies, though.

i dont think you understand how the blockchain works. lending them is losing them.
take it from someone who has literally lost hundreds of bitcoins through failed loans. it doesn't matter how trustworthy someone might have been when you ask for bitcoin plus interest  in bitcoin as a repayment method.
so you want to lend something irreversible so someone can else can short; so they can run back to or some other likely devaluing asset. except oops the price shot up and now no business plan the borrower could ever invision will allow them to re-buy and repay you your bitcoins. 
lend bitcoins, get ready for the liklihood you'll never see them and at best you might get a fiat structure repayment plan.
when you lend them you give them away unless you use m-of-n txn. but how can you lend what is a basically an escrowed txn for someone else to short.
in the end. nothing but litigation. these are not the droids you are looking for. honest people default time and time again attempting to borrow what is unlikely to ever be repaid.
