This is probably the most steady 24 hours in the history of Bitcoins.

You replied to me that you fund the adress I gave you, but there seems to be a error.

I think that the only reason this is important for some people right now is due to all the hype and new attention to Bitcoins, if you use Bitcoins as a replacement for all transactions in life there is a problem.
I see it as a great way to send funds to wherever I want, whenever I want and to whoever I want.
Also it's a great way to convert USD to other currencies while traveling from one country to another without paying 5+ % to Forex.
I'd like her to travel to Sweden, Finland or any other country that doesn't use USD and try to purchase stuff with her USD (not using a VISA/mastercard).
If you look at Bitcoins as a medium of exchange it's very functional for me at the moment.
