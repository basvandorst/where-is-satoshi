He did that by not updating his trezor for a long time (6mo) because there was a known exploit that was patched out.  If you read the story he was told about the exploit prior to trezor releasing the patch so he had assumed that exploit was how he could recover his PIN and he eventually did.  Also if you read the story you would see it was still an extremely tedious process and required him working with a "top hacker".

I much prefer the earlier statement myself.

Do you have any idea on a solid set of instructions or an F.A.Q. about cashing out bitcoin in the US and ensuring you are safe from a govt. perspective?

So where do the taxes come out?  I keep reading about capital gains, I feel like I'm missing something.

Own a trezor and looked at ledger when I was purchasing. Went with trezor because it was first and at the time it seemed the more popular option.  Have been happy with it and i like that I can lock it in my safe.  Seems now the ledger is becoming more popular.  Only complaint is limited wallet's for some other popular alt coins.  I didnt think the trezor T was adding more than like 2 more coins?

This happened to me @ 5000 and I had to watch 7 days because of weekend.  Ended up buying in at 5400.  You won't be mad when it hits 10k HODL.

I didn't mean using a new Fidelity to coinbase method.  Just in general through a standard 401k loan process.  Take the loan against your own portfolio and pay it back, with interest, to yourself.

Yes, unless you are unemployed

Just moved 10% over myself, young and able to take the risk IMO.
