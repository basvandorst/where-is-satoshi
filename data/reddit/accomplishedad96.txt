Like Hoover, Bitcoin will become a verb for sucking.
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:31:30


that's an oxymoron
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:30:57
There's this thing called economics, you should look it up!
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:18:31
Just the parts related to inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:57:57
sounds like his bags are getting really heavy, Draper must have bought more @ 19000

@_date: 2018-05-07 15:24:59
lol no

Lol, Hoover makes shitty vacuum cleaners, almost any other brand is better
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:12:42
Right, a trusted guide about trusted websites on a trusted reddit. This trustless cypherpunk future is shaping up really well!
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:32:31
No planning is involved either way.
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:27:34
You need to unplug your computer right now, go to a library, and find a book on basic economics. Don't come back online until you've read it. This is for your own benefit.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:20:15
I for one think it's scandalous that this upstart dares to disagree with Andreas.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:05:39


@_date: 2018-05-02 22:22:20
Real economics, mises.org pamphlets don't count.

Titanic isn't *sinking* simply because there's a huge hole in the side taking in water, if you look at the vast majority of the data it's mostly smooth sailing!
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:21:13




Yeah, the take-home message here sure is "Bitcoin is Cool"
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:34:46


except your dignity
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:47:19
Lol, he deleted the comment
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:33:10
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:27:17
But what if it's Paycoin that'll go to the moon instead of Bitcoin? To be absolutely 100% sure you should buy at least $1000 worth of Paycoin as well. And Bitconnect, of course.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:43:38
Actually the US at 1913 was a shithole compared to US today, largely because of the low tax rates.
Taxes enable infrastructure development, social safety nets and speed up scientific progress.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:41:44
No, it's just a universal phenomenon in good countries. Tax havens by definition mooch on their neighbors.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:53:51
If the yearly raises cannot keep up with living costs the problem isn't typically inflation but the low negotiating power of the labor compared to the employers. If this is the case, lowering the inflation rate or even introducing deflation will not help, since the workers will just be given yearly pay cuts instead. The solution is increasing the labor negotiating power by unionizing.

Bitcoiners relate to women about as well as the Ferengi.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:22:05


Which ones, exactly?
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:11:33
No, it's not true. Debit cards are nearly universal in western and southern Europe. Credit cards are not uncommon either.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:28:05


What is this even supposed to mean? That people who have lost real money on altcoins will suddenly develop an urge to lose more real money on bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:15:36
No problem, nobody ever takes anything ancaps say seriously anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:04:33
Yeah like Bitconeeeeeeeeect!
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:47:32
In some countries it has been, yes. Or productivity increase metrics.
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:41:41
Very insightful, now we are seeing the same phenomenon with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:06:37
Because the difficulty has more than quintupled in the past year.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:21:21
Lol, he completely obliterated your arguments and the best you can do is "sorry but I cannot waste any more time on you and your questions"?
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:19:26
I bet it's a constant struggle for you to keep the m'ladies at bay.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:15:10
Because a lot of bitcoiners are also crazy racist conspiracy theorists.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:59:30
Almost as good as dogecoin!
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:41:15
IOUs are just as good as money!
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:58:26
Right, Bitconneeeeect is looking real cheap right now! 
@_date: 2018-06-05 00:51:22


How? If they have no cash savings, there's nothing the inflation can erode. The real value of their salaries is reduced of course, but it is countered by yearly raises.
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:25:41
You can keep arguing that until you're blue in the face but the fact remains that bitcoin's value keeps going down, one bitcoin buying less and less every week. Hyperinflation.
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:10:05
Just think what'll happen when the next Chinese New Year comes and the current one still hasn't ended!
@_date: 2018-06-24 00:28:57
This is what bitcoiners actually believe!
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:19:37




I don't follow. You just said that embracing the free market and freeing the exchange rate crashed the value of the savings.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:04:51
The bottom is at $0.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:14:21
That ["report"]( is laughable trash. Written in 2014, the author concludes that the emission trend of bitcoin mining is "decreasing". Reality: it increased at least tenfold by the end of 2017.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:50:22
By having men with guns lock people in cages. It's super effective against libertarians, it's like their number one nightmare.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:38:20
The court still disagrees with you, and so do I. You can argue about what is and is not accepted in court until you're blue in the face, but the fact of the matter is that the court did consider the evidence for Ross having ordered murders to be "clear and unambiguous".
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:44:34
Okay, cool. I'm curious though, since you wrote


What do you think would be a fair sentence for trying to have six people murdered?
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:22:01
Yes, he was charged. [The indictment is right here, see page 1](


@_date: 2018-03-11 11:19:21
That's not closed either.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:06:11
It was adopted immediately by its intended audience, universities and government labs.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:38:58


Yeah, it's only been, what, 10 years?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:15:46
Except down.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:55:06
What are you even talking about? This has nothing to do whether Ulbright was charged or not (he was). Indictment == charge.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:10:34
He never will, because he's already serving a life sentence for his other crimes, and there's no way it could be extended. Another trial on top of that would be a frivolous waste of taxpayer money.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:24:36
That's because it's not true. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:37:42
It would have been an expensive and unnecessary trial, since his other crimes were already enough net him a life sentence.
Let me remind you that this whole exchange began with you posting


and from there we've arrived at


so I think I'm done here.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:44:26
Too bad the decentralized majority counts for nothing in a court of law.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:26:08


Yet you're the one who felt he needed to lie about whether Ross was charged with the attempted murders or not, right here:




@_date: 2018-03-27 12:35:56
No, it was not. There were two different indictments for two different trials, one in NY, the other one in Maryland. This is the Maryland indictment.
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:58:52


@_date: 2018-03-28 14:45:11
they're all bitcoins man
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:15:43
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:04:28


This, but they'll immediately sell the BTC for real money.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:21:58


Like they caused bitcoin mining to disperse, lol.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:31:34
The court disagrees with you.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:29:34


Says who? The law certainly doesn't, since nobody seems to own the bitcoin trademark.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:07:29
You are arguing against the actual court transcript from the sentencing, you genius. That's the judge talking.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:30:15
He was charged.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:33:24
He was.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:38:35
Can you read? From the very link you posted:


That separate indictment is the one I linked, the Maryland one. That second case never went to trial because he was already sentenced to life in NY for his other crimes.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:07:09
Lol do try (you might end up locked in a cage though)
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:13:08
No, I'm saying all the element technologies of the internet were almost immediately adopted by their intended audience as they were devoloped, because they were useful and performed the task they were designed for.
Bitcoin hasn't been adopted even by its target audience of drug dealers and ancaps because it does not work very well.
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:44:51
Normal Yoda wouldn't but this is the Bitcoin-Yoda
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:48:06
 it's a decentralized website with no owner
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:28:45
Wouldn't it be smarter to buy it for cheaper later?
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:41:39
There is, it's called voting with paper ballots

Physical security.
