Everyone's new sometime

I never "asked" for anything, I said "feel free to buy me a sandwich". In an effort to avoid arguing though, I removed the address. I honestly don't care about your opinion either way, I just don't feel like arguing.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:00:25
I did mention a small margin of error for consistency ;)
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:33:13
Thanks, I will pass this on to a developer when I find one. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:33:53
I'm a front end UI/UX designer (mobile/web) &amp; I emphasize accepting payment in BTC from all my customers. Feel free to message me if you'd be interested. I have a large network of designers &amp; developers who can help.
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:00:29
Noted. Gonna need to hire a dev to help me out on this one. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:00:33
Exactly. When you think of entities that will welcome BTC, the last place I think would be accepting is a state/community college. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:32:51
Why not? There's no harm in a nonchalant plug. Post yours for all I care.
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:19:08
Restored the value to the true value and disabled the click/counter function until I can get it fixed and secured. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:04:53
How is this even in the slightest bit racist? Because I called it Juan's Cantina? Or because I used Mexican food? Replace every instance of Juan's Cantina with Bob's Burger Bin &amp; every instance of Taco Bell with McDonalds, if that makes you happy.

Just purchased a few hundred thousand shares. Best of luck to you, we're all hoping for the best!

I just posted my extremely layman definition of the MtGox scenario. I compare it to taco shits...should let give it a read ;)
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:41:14
Don't get me wrong, I'm a lifetime buyer. My coins are staying safely stashed on paper for the long haul. I was just curious to see any speculation on the cause of this micro dip–if any.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:25:12
The counter is broken, and I in my vast lack of developmental know-how dont know how to fix it. See my post below. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 08:53:50
I agree. Unfortunately I'm not a developer (I outsourced the javascript code on oDesk), but if you could offer some insight, I'd love the help.
@_date: 2014-04-19 06:14:47
Nice! Thanks if you pledged :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:13:26
Well no, but 645 this morning to 605 a few minutes ago is.
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:07:28
Soooooo...good time to buy, or good time to sell? Been watching the thread like a hawk, so I can see there's not a general consensus on the matter, or really any discussion at all on the likelihood that will have to react swiftly.
I am afraid of going to sleep with what can happen in just the blink of an eye. If it's a cash out, it's time to let go for a short duration. But if, with some mystical flying spaghetti monster godlike miracle, this is the beginning of a Gox "recovery", it might be time to max out the visa.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:23:40
I agree with paleh0rse, I dont want to force anyone into giving that kind of information.
@_date: 2014-01-18 03:32:18
Now I'm curious to see what he said.
@_date: 2014-04-19 22:28:57
What the hell does that even mean? Defining an entire group of people by the actions of one? I've admitted multiple times that I outsourced the code development for the button javascript. And guess what? The developer I used on oDesk explicitly asked to **NOT** be credited, because he is **NOT** a supporter of bitcoin. So there goes your argument.
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:08:22
Indeed, but I'm wondering if it is reaction to a specific event, or a domino effect...
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:42:52
Well, because it is a template. I even admitted to that above. It's a squarespace website, and if you've never heard of SS, it is a highly customizable templated CMS. And I will admit that the button code is broken, which is why I have disabled it for now and restored the number to the last true value.
@_date: 2014-04-20 07:09:25
Again, how in the hell is this a security patch with bitcoin? That's like saying your nice car is a clunker because you got a shitty air freshener.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:40:19
 
Sorry for leaving it out, I did't want to seem "needy"
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:47:56
Woah, what? How do you read minds?! Get out of my head!!! ;)
@_date: 2014-04-19 08:52:36
I didn't think about that, good point.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:42:09
Multiple exchanges have integrated methods of doing this. Coinbase for example has this option in their Tools section under Merchant Tools. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:27:37
Woah! Reddit broke my button! Hah, I mean this in a good way, of course. Thanks to all the traffic, the button has broken. The last valid number I can see in my database was 38,220, and then someone hulk-smashed the javascript and flooded it. I'm going to disable the button for now until I can find someone who could help me clean this mess up. Until then, thanks to everyone for breaking my button :)
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:48:46
This is excellent, thanks for the resource!
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:46:37
I forgot I had that on there. Removed the requirement, thank's for pointing this out!
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:09:09
Well shit, now that I see they're using the same SS theme I want to change mine. Good find. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 08:23:57
That's actually a good talking point. When I created the site, I never expected to get nearly as many pledges as I have so far--which is why I never went public with it. But in the last two hours, theres been an addition of 4,000 pledge (holy crap!). If the site continues to generate traffic (thanks to Reddit), I'd love to expand to include more inclusive information on the legitimacy of BTC. If you or anyone you know could offer some ideas on how, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts!
@_date: 2014-01-18 04:07:01
Just wanted to update, my balance arrived. Thanks, guys!
Now I just have to wait for my account to get verified. Ughhh
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:24:18
Ughhh! Reddit broke my button! As I stated in another comment, I am not a developer--and apparantly the dev who I hired to make the button isn't much of one, either. I've disabled the click function for the button and restored the value to the last true count. 
In regards to the domain, I only purchased the domain on March 21st but the squarespace has been up and running since around early December. I've just been using a short url service until recent.

Children &lt; Junior College students (half of which are older than me, haha). I teach a night Introductory Photography course, so half of them argued that Del Taco is better than Taco Bell, and the other half were already asleep.

A heavily modified Squarespace template, built in developer mode.

I'd back support in banning monopolies with any service provider, be it mobile, TV or anything else. Unfortunately lobbyists have a greater voice than the general public.

The school job is only secondary income, so they're putting all 100% of the pay into my account. That, and I doubt the school would put enough effort into fulfilling two types of payments (BTC &amp; traditional deposit). It doesn't take much effort on my end to offload 70% to paper wallet, deposit 20% into FIAT &amp; keep 10% in my account. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 08:55:07
When would you recommend a decent time to post something like this would be?
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:08:03
He's not your buddy, friend!

Way ahead of ya :) Listed .1, .5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 &amp; "custom" with a default of .01
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:43:21
Very similar, but not necessarily anything uncommon when comparing to a market stock. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 03:38:20
Oh, right...yeah that doesn't really apply haha. But still, wise advice for anyone new to the coinage.
Still worrying about my Mt. Gox account. Hoping I didnt just lose .3

I bet 1btc on No about 30 minutes after the bet opened--Trying to figure out what my result is based on the current situation. Admittedly, it was a completely blind bet in a system that I have very little understanding (bitbet/gambling in general). 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:38:09
"Back in the day". Best choice of words.
