I think it's a good physical representation for those who have trouble thinking outside the box of fiat currency to cryptocurreny... espically to those who have only heard of Bitcoin but are skeptical of understanding the mechanics. 
Taking lego, something many of us played with as a kid, and using it as a representation of bitcoin...at least it's starts a conversation and engages people with something they understand. Challenege anyone else to make a better physical model of the bitcoin 'process'...because  I would really like to see one for my own understanding!!!

Might as well extend it to our bank accounts while we’re at it ����

Ahhh I should have looked up the definition...sorry thats interesting fact in itself! So if the daily volume number itself is the amount of open buy/sell order and is decreasing at times that means people have canceled their order (either sell or buy) ?
Is it possible make a market look more active then it is by having two entities agree to trade to each other constantly...I mean with bitcoin you could have millions of transactions on the books for small amount of bitcoin trading 0.0000000000000001 bit x1000 and so on to make it look like their is a huge volume of trade?

I guess I’m more optimistic in our pursuits. We will just continue to erode capitalists hold on humanity by pursuing liberty. We are at a point in late stage capitalism where the founding fathers were at the point of the Boston tea riot.  Except the British empire in this case is the international corporate empire. Continually socializing loses and privatizing the profits for their gain we at the grass roots have only one way forward. Take our money back by collectively agreeing what is value.

Mr. Robot for me is a very interesting thought experiment. 
Too many parallels to our world to not think about what could happen. 
This credit cycle is coming to an end I guess the when is the big question. The powers that be might rather hit the reset button then continue the stagnant growth to negitive interest rates ect. What might come out is a co-opting/take over of Bitcoin and/or creation of 'gov-coin' but im sure we're all more then a little wary of an all knowing ledger. 
There will always be other altcoins to choose from (I hope) but I don't know if everyone realizes that we're playing for All the marbles. When your playing for keeps things can get a little chaotic. 
It's strange but it feels like r/preppers, r/silverbugs, r/lostgeneration, r/homestead, r/bitcoin all have a lot more in common then we may think. Like having a disease and not seeing any symptoms (asymptomatic) is how most people go through the world. But when I look at those subs I start to wonder if they're some of the symptoms of a diseased economy/society.

As a music major, looking back at music and technology's symbiotic relationship; Technology pushes the envolope and industries don't always know how to respond. More often then not the music industry is one of the first to adopt and exploit new technologies efficiencies and profit. 
We don't need copyright anymore if we have this. We don't need to worry about highering a manager, publicist, producer and marketing agency. We can let the music speak for itself. What will be the key is getting bitcoin savy audiences onboard. That's probably going to be the rebellious millenials who want to stick it to the man...so r/bitcoin...what music do you like?
