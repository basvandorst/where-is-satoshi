A good P2P exchange is Bisq (formerly BitSquare), otherwise try Gemini. RobinHood is also about to release a free trading platform, and there may be a Bitcoin ATM near you: coinatmradar.com
Edit: The Square Cash app now allows you to buy Bitcoin as well, though I haven’t tried it yet so I can’t speak to fees or whatever.

NVidia has actually had to tell retailers to sell to gamers, not miners lol, what a world.

Just see all the posts from people freaking out, making a dip below $10k seem like the end of the world. Imagine if they had been part of MtGox, how salty the tears would be, mmmmmm

Unless things have changed, you do not need to hold a balance in your full node, it will process transactions the same as any other node regardless of balance.
Did things change??

Dude, relax.

It seems like the price is being artificially bolstered whenever the price maintains a downward path. Is the market being manipulated? If so, what does that mean for Bitcoin's actual worth in the long-term?
I'm a long-term holder and plan on holding, it just seems like the market isn't reflective of Bitcoin's worth...it seems more and more like another conduit for the rich to get richer.

Check out  You can search for any Bitcoin ATMs near your location, I've used [this one]( (Springfield, OR) a few times with zero issues. If you're buying it'll cost a bit more and if you're selling you'll get a bit less, but IMO you're paying a bit extra for convenience and the ability to walk up to a machine and buy/sell Bitcoin, without registering on a site or whatever.
The ATM I used only required a valid cell number to text a confirmation code to. I can't recall if it asked to scan my ID but I don't remember having to do so.
I agree with - Spend USD/fiat, hold your BTC. I've always regretted any BTC purchase I made, solely because now I don't have that BTC anymore lol...but it's all subjective.
Edit: Feel free to PM me with any specific questions regarding how to use the ATMs and I'll gladly help, it's scary sending money to a random machine with no guarantee it'll go right.

I don’t know about “everyone”, maybe those with special interests are spreading around claims they can’t possibly validate, but not “everyone”.
It’s called “FUD” (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), and “FOMO” (Fear Of Missing Out).
Both of these social manipulation tools are employed by people/groups who are trying to discredit Bitcoin, like the BCash crowd (Roger Ver).
You gotta learn to recognize and tune out the comments that are aimed at spreading FUD, and to suppress your own desire to buy or sell (FOMO) based on other’s comments.
You’re your own bank now...do *you* think buying Bitcoin as it dips is the same as catching a falling knife?

[Oh no, oh no, say it isn't so.](

I’m reminded of the “boiling frog” analogy, where no changes are noticed if they’re small enough.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:02:03
It’s probably coordinated by the BCash crowd, they’ve had an active FUD campaign since BCash was spawned, and Ver openly admitted that one of his main goals is to confuse newcomers that BCash is actually Bitcoin.
If you hear FUD, see if you can verify or debunk the claim, and leave it as a response. Even though we can’t delete troll accounts, we can reply with information that anyone can verify, and whoever is following the thread in the future will see which comments don’t hold water and which do!

Point taken, but please make an original post using your own words, instead of copy/pasting portions of a different post. This sub needs originality.

Cheap Bitcoin is cheap Bitcoin. It is superior to traditional financial systems, and the blockchain alone serves many uses outside finance.
It’s simply better.

CHEAP BITCOIN WOOOO

I used to think I was a bad Bitcoiner for only holding, but then I realized that anything above ~$500 is profit and the whole dynamic changed.
It’s like all the complainers are getting scared on the long, slow climb before the roller coaster actually starts getting fun. 
A superior financial system doesn’t need marketing, it’s simply better. That’s what Bitcoin is and continues to be...simply better.
