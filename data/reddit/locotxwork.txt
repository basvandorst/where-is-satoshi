I can tell you that "missed opportunity depression" is real and it stays in your mind and never goes away.  "what if..." or "if I had just done..." those things will creep up on the most inopportune moments.  You could be driving and you see some nice Tesla drive by and boom . . "if i had just..." I could be driving one of those.   It's real, it's very real and dangerous.  The mind is beautiful but can be scary too.

"Missed opportunity . . . . . . " that's the most important part doesn't matter if it's spawned by greed, or noble intentions, the hurt of a missed opportunity is what I see is the cause for the strife.

So simple yet I just learned and truly understood this.  If anything Bitcoin has educated a lot of people about how exchanges and finance works!
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:19:54
Missed opportunity of success.  Whether is was financial, uh not swinging on a 3-2 pitch with bases loaded and 3 outs, not asking that girl you had a crush on when she broke up with her boyfriend, not taking that trip on spring break to cancun with friends in college,  . . . those missed opportunites stay with you . . in this case it was financial.  I thought Gordon Gekko said "Greed, for a lack of a better word, is good"?

Wait . .EVERYONE would consider themselves better off rich than poor . . .that's a universal quality not because of the "rich" part but because the financial burdens and stresses you no longer have to endure.  There are some people who want to be rich not for greedy purposes but for better life purposes and essence that could be presumed as one being greedy.  It's all relative.  But again, nothing to kill yourself over.

Yup.  My son played on a baseball team with another kid and for our end of year party he was hosting, so we go over and they are loaded, huge house it was freaking insane.   Now, next season, suddenly all the parents are cheering for him (you can tell they are over cheering) and so are the kids.  Boom kid strikes out and I hear sooo many (that's okay, you'll get them next time).  Even my son was like treating him differently because he's got the coolest toys and biggest house and stuff.   
Well, I grew up poor and I can sniff out that "wealth privilege" treatment.   It is insane how people treat you differently when you are wealthy.  In some jacked up way, if I was wealthy, I'd try to help others be wealthy, so they wouldn't treat me different, we'd be on the same level.  That's why I think some rich people get along with rich people, because they are at the same level.  When you are both rich, that "wealth privilege" is cancelled out.  Same thing when you are poor.  But what bothers me the most, in both cases, how we treat people is based on how much money we have.  
So when you have none, it's easy for everyone to see who you really are.   But, being poor then being rich is easier than being rich and then becoming poor.  And so when this guy's brother went from the potential of being poor to really rich and then back down to poor, psychologically it's a hard fall.  Like I said, I've been broke and I've survived the bottom level and that type of confidence and experience is priceless.

I'd like to know this too.  I had some funds in a rolled over IRA I totally forgot about and I want to invest it into Bitcoin but can't.  My only option is to cash out, take the income hit, tax hit and 10% withdraw hit and then invest what I have . . .whereas it would be nice to invest the whole value.  Anyone work for Fidelity know the answer?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:56:34
Meh, even if true, at least it's a big step back to reflect on your own personal thoughts and feelings about FOMO or your attitude about wealth and life in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:13:59

This was good, but at least in this analogy you can go to the property and the "valuable" item is there, tangible.   Where is the money for each bitcoin at?  Maybe i'm missing something, but even in banking where you put your money in at one location, get a reciept and then take it and pull it out from another location, you still have access to the valuable item correct?  So the ledger is lost basically?

I think it makes BTC more valuable.

I too was having this constant checking of the price and should I buy Eth, do I buy more BTC now?  What if the price drops?  What if I lose everything and people make fun of me for falling into this scam?  See BTC as a hobby right now, as a fun game.  You are adding too much stress on you and it's not good.  As far as the FOMO from the 2013/14 . . that's gone, past, it's like an egg you cracked, you can't fix it and you can't change it . . look forward and HODL.

Yeah but the software may be proven but there always a chance the framework it runs on (hardware) may break.   So pay attention to all components of the Bitcoin infrastructure.

if we were both bitcoins, we just lost the value of the money we paid for them.

I never said that.  I said if there was a hack/crack what make you think it people would be go around telling everyone about it and making it public for obvious reasons.

Not if they are purchasing things illegally . . drugs . .campaign contributions . .  cash withdraws from illegal credit cards received form identity theft . . . corporation finance hiding... etc.   Someone asked me why people should trust bitcoin and i thought I'd search and see what my fellow redditors were saying that's why.  Why are you upset?  
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:27:17
If I go and buy drugs online and they steal my money and don't give me my drugs . . . who do I run to?  who can help me?  help to get my money back?  Just answer that.

Wait wait.  Just because a hack/crack hasn't be trumpeted to the world doesn't mean it doesn't exist for even the truly best thieves do not go around like "skitties" and tell everyone.  They keep that quiet.  Why? because then it will draw attention to get fixed.  In fact the BEST thief is the one that goes in, takes what they need/want and leaves no track.  
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:06:40
If you are going to say that then indirectly with so may jumps you can say that everyone is already effected/using bitcoin.

At the end of the day, nothing perhaps.  But I can't support a person who is a liar and has no integrity.  I know banks don't care as long as they get paid and I guess this falls in line with that.  As long as it's a good product and she's getting paid that's all that matters in this world anymore right?  Hiding the truth is just as devious as lying about it.  I'm just one person so it doesn't matter right.

If I post something on 4Chan that says "look at the weak security on this electronic device, I wouldn't do it but if you wanted to, you could write firmware with instructions like this, that could make that do this and that" . . .and then a 15 year old reads it and does it.  Would he be in trouble would I?  I see "hackers" do penetration tests all the time who share information like this.  "man, I found the default password for the Cisco blah blah router isn't changed, if you wanted to you could run (name of network mapping tool) to identify those routers and telnet into them and lock them out, it would suck if someone did that.

Keep the faith say   I think this is a good thing.  This event shows how an institution (bank, country, etc..) can still have an effect on the currency.  Bitcoin was decentralized to avoid these types of leverages and when it holds it's value (as I predict it will) it will show it's value and worth.

"I don't care what others think" - yeah, saying stuff like lets us further know where you stand.  You sound like that kid from Texas that claimed he "invented a clock" but all he did was take apart something that was already built.  
"IT FUCKING DOESN'T MATTER" is what people claim when they want to avoid the fact that it does matter.   You may not believe it, but honesty and integrity matters.  
"Go get a job and stop bullying and harassing a 16 year old on the Internet".  Well, quit claiming you did something when you didn't.  You truly do come off sounding like a teenager who is upset they got busted.   
In all honesty, if you make some money cool.  That's why  you did it in the first place.  At least be honest about that.
