This thread reminds me of gold in 2008. Seriously guys, don't put anything in bitcoin you're not willing to lose. It's fun to make fun of anonymous internet users but this shit is real for some folks.

Canadian Tire money has been around for a long time. Branded currency isn't a new idea. Most currency was bank branded back in the day.

This is exactly how people talk in a mania. Have we learned nothing from Internet stocks and real estate? Jebus. Terrible advice. Tell them to buy it if they want to use it, not to hoard it looking for a pay day.

This was an opinion stated by the bank, not necessarily a change in policy.

You look exactly how I expected redditors in would look. Strange.

I meant the "weak hands". The people who are speculating in the shallowest sense of the word and have no real conviction.

Exchanging or propositioning?

These early stage investors expect most of their investments to fail, but if there is a decent shot at a big exit they will take the bet. It would be stupid not to have some exposure to bitcoin, it's a huge story, that doesn't mean ultimately it's any more likely to succeed.

"probably" is not good enough to overcome "reasonable doubt"

These conversations scare me. There is way too much speculation going on. I think it would be healthy for Bitcoin to have another monster crash down to like $10 or something and wash out all the pretenders.

This is an editorial in a newspaper. It doesn't mean anything is going to change with government policy any time soon.

How would Bitcoin be represented on the balance sheet? It's not cash, just an asset? Will they have to pay tax when they sell that asset with a gain?

Cleared within 10 seconds, according to a podcast I listened to last week. I think NPR.
