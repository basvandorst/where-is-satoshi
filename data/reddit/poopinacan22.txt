yeah I should do this

Perhaps, but again what if I were to die? Or somehow lose brain function

So what's Mars? 1 mil?

ehh, sort of difficult to access, costs money, and I'd feel a little funny leaving my seed in there.

I thought about it, but I dont think I could trust myself with that being the only storage, especially long term. For example, what if I were to die? My BTC would be lost forever. Perhaps I could memorize it and then stash a physical backup somewhere very secure

Dude is just advertising his crypto twitter account. Lame
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:49:30
It has had technical vulnerabilities. Quite a few actually,  but it has maintained *near* perfect uptime

To be fair, this was a 3rd party account of Gates' take on BTC. He himself may have interpreted the whole exchange very differently. I don't think  you can claim Gates had a "super positive stance" on Bitcoin soley from this passage.

Lol, doesn't change anything.

I dislike ads disguised as crypto posts

Dude, awful advice. How would he get it out? If he doesn't get it out where can he spend it? Not only is this bad advice it is totally out of place, and it really does make us all look bad

I'm not a newcomer, and I am aware of all of those developements. Lightening network alone will not provide enough privacy, nor will sidechain solutions because they involve direct on and off ramps with a totally public ledger. Confidential transactions would be a big step in the right direction, but after the drama that ensued over a block size increase and ensuing hardfork. I am not at all confident that Bitcoin will ever implement a significant protocol change like that. More fundamentally, I am someone that believes a currency should be built on inherent anonymity and fungibility. Bitcoin, right now, is neither of those things and they are about three steps back from Monero on those fronts.

This type of thinking is absurd. Firstly, those corporations and shadowy entities WILL CONTINUE OPERATING. In fact, it will be only those with resources, technology, and people that are able to conduct shady business and conceal their money. The average Joe simply won't have the equipment, connections, or knowledge. And more importantly, sacrificing everyone's right to privacy in exchange for only a BETTER CHANCE AT CTACHING CRIMINALS. Is absurd. This type of thinking is basically relying on governments not to abuse their power and spy on all of their citizens private financial lives. I wonder how the rest of the BTC community feels about this. I would like to believe they understand the way the world works and the need to disempower large political entities, but I worry their thoughts may be clouded by stupid crypto currency tribalism.

I'm a Nano holder but I'll give you some of the reasons you're looking for because everyone on this sub is too salty to respond. 
Nano suffers from a problem all PoS coins suffer from, the inability to securely bootstrap a node without relying on peers. (
Additionally, Nano suffers from issues related to bandwidth and storage, and it's feeless structure hasn't really been tested yet. If a company like bitmain were to spin up a few ASICs they could probably spam the hell out of the network.
Nano is also significantly more centralized than Bitcoin. Unfortunately, devs hold &gt;51% of the voting weight still (but I'm hoping that'll change soon).
Finally, there are some potential issues with man in the middle attacks that could be possible with it's architecture.
I'm sure there are more, but that's most of the reasons BTC people will hate nano, and honestly they are legitimate complaints. I think calling any DAG "superior" technology is a little misguided and you should spend time researching the tradeoffs NANO makes to achieve feeless near instant transactions.

There isn't really a solution to the bootstrapping issue. Cardano claims to have one but theirs really just involves lots of checkpoints, it doesn't fix the core issue. The issue with the 51% voting weight is it requires users to switch their representative. This will take time and is hindered by exchanges. For example, I think Binance holds more than 10% of the voting weight and it's all pointed at the devs. As the network develops it has gradually become more decentralized but the issue is tricky and will take time to solve.

Just ordered one, everything worked great. Thanks man

Funny. I started really researching/buying Bitcoin in June. Within two months my dad as so onboard with the whole thing that he bought a while Bitcoin (~4600) when he bought it. Now he wants two.

I think 2.5 million is quite a bit honestly. Do they really need much more than that? Like sure the ICOs are raising ridiculous amount, but I think most of us agree it's a cash grab and they really don't need that money.

Fair enough, I think you can't look at bitcoin like a company though. Isn't the work being done for the lightning network coming from contributors around the world, not just lightning labs?

I'm not sure if you're saying "um no" to the tracking or paying your taxes. If it's tracking that's 100% true. Any exchange that you buy/sell Bitcoin for fiat has all of your personal data and wallet address information. With that starting point it is pretty damn simple to track your BTC transactions.

I'm confused about the intention of the post. They have to verify IDs for US regulators. What are you pissed about exactly?
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:27:29
Fair enough, I agree

Which they can do
