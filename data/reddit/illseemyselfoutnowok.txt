After it grows a bit more such an act wouldn't destroy Bitcoin. It would just plummet the price.
Which would be good for Bitcoin long term. But bad for the types described in this post, no?

maybe try an older version, using it to send to a new wallet?
or if console is available in older version export every key separately and load into wallet?
edit: oh i see, if it's encrypted you'll need to remember the password. think hard. if its a shit password there are people who can try to brute force it for you.

source code for the version your wallet was most likely made in. cant find a binary. seems worth a shot.

if its so very old that its not encrypted i think you can just open it up in notepad and look for the private keys.
otherwise I suggest trying to get it to work with an older version (perhaps offline), and trying to figure out the password.

Microsoft stock isn't an unprecedented currency commodity hybrid online technology. The CEOs of these companies are bound by law to act in their best interests.
Satoshi has enough BTC to crash the price into the ground for a long time coming. He's under no obligation to any shareholders. This is only going to delay adoption.
I want to believe. I hope somebody frees me of this point of view.

I think that fact that Satoshi has as much BTC as he does locked away would deter businesses and serious investors. Knowing that one person could crash the price at these early stages, I think they would be likely to take a look at a better distributed alt-coin.
Somebody CMV please.

are you able to see the last time the file was modified by clicking properties or something? maybe that could clue you in to which version of bitcoin-qt to try.

also how long have you tried leaving the client on after you said that it froze on "verifying wallet?" it might jsut be taking a while to rescan the blockchain at the verifying wallet phase.

I literally ask for somebody to clue me in in the post.
Somebody please free me of this hangup. I'm a bitcoin fan. I want to believe. But this nags at me.

I'm in awe of how many people don't "get it."
It's such a privilege to be alive to witness this new technology mature. It could potentially save all our asses someday. But people are apathetic.

supply and demand.
If demand is higher than supply, sell orders on exchanges end up getting eaten up, and people who want to buy have to do so from higher priced sell orders
If there's more bitcoin out there for sale than what people want/need sell orders increase and buy orders decrease, forcing people who want to sell to lower their price.
it's really that simple. if one exchange has a better price available than another some bot will spot it and perform arbitrage for profit. that's why all the exchanges end up close to charging the same amount.

you said you've tried replacing %APPDATA%\Bitcoin\wallet.dat with the one you're trying to access and using the most recent version already, correct? (or just import wallet).
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:38:49
%APPDATA% in an explorer window, then clicking roaming/bitcoin if memory serves. (assuming you're using windows. if linux and maybe mac? it's ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat)

He could contact bitpay perhaps. I'd imagine they have lots of BTC for sale. Curious though, is he planning to pay his employees in Bitcoin?
