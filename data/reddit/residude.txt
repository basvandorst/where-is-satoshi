well im sure everyone here has heard it a thousand times, but shit do i regret spending my coins at 200 on the dark net. literally hit 1000 within a few weeks if i recall correctly. man, if you were to look at my coinbase history from back then, youd think i was some lunatic spending 30000 on acid and mushrooms!

made my account in 2013

Yeah that's the whole point. If it wasn't for people caring about money, btc wouldn't be nearly where it is today

200 dollars was a big deal when I still had coins 
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:51:02
Maybe it was 2-3 days, they were at 205 when I spent them, and it very quickly jumped to 1200. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:39:45
Lol, literally the day before they jumped to over a thousand I spent 2 bitcoin on the silk road (or another site, can't remember). I was so mad

Yeah I guess I was remembering it wrong sorry.

No, trump did win. People were fed up, and they spoke with their votes.

So the only thing you know is what you saw in a movie which was made to make him look like an ass? And how is taking a second mortgage out to fund your venture not a huge risk?

But if he's already eaten it what are you gonna do? Eat his vomit?

The equivalent of 6.4m usd 
@_date: 2016-10-17 12:15:17
No but you transferred the equivalent of 50k 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:22:56
Yep I remember looking at 98 dollar coins, thinking man these are pricey! I also remember spending 4 bitcoins on the silk road. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:18:11
Not true. And I'm sure you never had any help in life. Nope. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:19:35
I think I spent roughly 5 btc on coke and acid off the darknet back in the day. And not a lot of it lol
