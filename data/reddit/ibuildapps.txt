I am pretty new to Bitcoin. Please elaborate, I am happy to know which part I am not getting right.

Why I like Bitcoin from business perspective:
* borderless transactions, instantly, anywhere
* one currency (I have clients all around the world, this really simplify dealing with money)
* instant transfers - I am taking often some % upfront upon agreement so there is no more waiting till the money hit the account or clears, waiting for international transfers etc.
* small or almost no transaction fees
* unpredictable value - yes, I still consider it as an advantage - the amount received today might have more value
Moreover, accepting Bitcoins is just additional payment option. If someone still prefer to pay me in traditional way, I am ok with it.

I am front-end dev and I like this idea.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:52:59
This is how I imagine it.

Yes, I know. But its created by people and people have an access to it.

I saw the code, I will be honest - is a piece of complex stuff, I am dev myself, but it takes time to consume it and breaks down to fist parts to understand the whole.
I am happy that you are one of those who looked into GIT repo and knew it everything :)

Dude, open source project aint much safer from close if no one take cares of them. Look what happen when Heartbleed got uncovered. OpenSSL - known and used globally by most of the biggest companies out there suddenly became a nightmare. In development world we always assume that shit might hit the fun. If something can break, it will.
Moreover devs in Bitcoin industry doesn't earn shitloads of $$$ for maintaining and making products around Bitcoin - this same happened to OpenSSL - no one really maintained it and keep an eye because is no one got paid for it.
