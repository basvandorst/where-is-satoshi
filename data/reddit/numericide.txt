I met the SolidX guys once. Their original plan was to just “idk get bitcoin off Coinbase or something” so I have zero faith in them unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:16:32
This guy doesn’t bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:57:20
Yeah what a shame those guys made bitcoin look sketchy
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:58:30
That's an expensive fire show

Can you even do a double spend from a mobile device? I think 0 confirms is safe for day to day use

No decent pool would be mining with the old system if a clear answer for the block-size is chosen. The coins mined on the wrong blockchain would eventually disappear, and I'll bet .005 bitcoin that most exchanges unanimously update their respective wallets to the correct blockchain, so the whichever other coins you think would somehow trade at a premium would not even be confirmed going in.

Only two coins listed here are worth less than they were when this was taken. I still like those odds.

Put my cold wallet in a drawer and forgot about it as much as possible

Beginners should not be using core. I opened Core in 2010 and it was so annoying to sync that I didn’t use bitcoin again until 2013. I could have been rich!! So download electrum, or something where you won’t need to download the entire blockchain to get your coins out.

faucet.lightning.community is a suggested peer in that readme a little ways down.

“Conservative anti-immigrant pundit Lauren Southern was banned from the site in 2017 for her involvement in an organization blocking NGO ships aiming to help refugees. Patreon cited the potential loss of life as the reason for the ban, and this caused prominent conservative Sam Harris to move away from the site in protest, inspiring others to do the same.
Popular Youtuber Carl Benjamin with almost 1 million followers was kicked for using racist and homophobic slurs against his critics, cutting off a huge source of revenue”

If more than $5.7m in bitcoin is bought and held each day, the demand outweighs the supply (not to mention the supply creation after next halving). There are only 1,800 bitcoins created every 24 hours, soon to be 900.

This article basically says, “racist assholes who want to get paid to act like racist assholes on the internet should use crypto.”

Hivewallet is my favorite. I'm not bashing breadwallet's functionality, but it's icon looks like the logo for a bad daytime talk show.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:22:18


Is Hive's security compromised in some way?

pouring money into a black hole is more akin to the idea of fiat currency
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:40:16
I have USD also, nobody said you should put all your money into bitcoin. I send my friends gift cards a lot using gyft, and use the app Lawnmower to put cents into bitcoin. Just because bitcoin's price had a bad year doesn't mean it can't be an interesting hobby.

Fake news. What are bitmain’s running costs? Probably low, unlikely they’ll go totally under.
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:24:18
It’s down because people are overselling. You can’t think of anyone benefitting from this?

This is the answer. Just let it sync before you start putting in your old .dat files. Just shut down and reopen every time you switch to a new .dat.

You think the last bull run started at 3,500?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:08:51
Yeah stock in Tesla - not a currency so I dunno how it will go up in value if the worth isn’t there
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:30:43
I’ve always applied this to buying bitcoins in hand as opposed to purchasing miners. Mining is tempting, but the ₿ in the hand is really the way to go.
@_date: 2018-12-26 22:29:23
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:39:42
Then it will fall to 2,600
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:20:56
I was nervous when I put $20k in at $280. Calm down and let new investors be investors.

Bitcoin core can only open one wallet.dat at a time, and you do so by simply placing it in the right folder and opening bitcoin core and letting it sync, or typing -rescan into the debug. Good luck!

Isn’t monero still CPU only? Probably the best bet imo
