I do the same with an apartment I rent out in Durres, Albania. No btc paying customers yet and it has been already a year I'm advertising it.

iOS version?

Wait till you receive money, it's a better feeling.

Don't know why I was expecting an Alpha Romeo. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:44:32
If he has money, tell him not to spend it on Bitcoin. For the bitcoin to catch up, will need time. Don't let him spend his savings now that are needed most.

Hi five Victoria! :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:18:24
Whoa, thanks mate. Since losing all my wealth on MtGox, I had forgotten how it feels to get involved again with BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:26:29
Kudos to you good sir. I just got tipped by a total stranger a couple of minutes ago. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:47:49
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:14:51
Is this still on?
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:09:47
Cheers from Albania! :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:29:38
Sweeet. Thanks.

My grand-grandfather did that with real money in the early 1900 and when his sons tried to exchange the money, probably a decade later, it was worth nothing. My father does not remember what currency it was but being in Albania, I think it was probably Austrian or Turkish currency.

So meta.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:26:00
Plot twist, the thief himself made a large purchase of XBT from that ATM earlier in the day and came later to steal his money out of the ATM. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:25:17
2007? The whitepaper was published in October 2008.
@_date: 2016-12-25 15:57:36
How, if I may ask?

You better be keeping your word, OP. ^^^I'm ^^^not ^^^even ^^^American.
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:57:50
Looks like the nightclub entrance in my block. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 14:45:39
Probably lost the paper wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:08:19
I'm all in on renting my place for bitcoins but no luck so far.
@_date: 2016-12-03 21:08:24
I mean, I want people to see my other images, that will generate more traffic. I just don't want them to see how much I make. 
As for the second question, more like click on the image to open it in full resolution on a new tab. Because right now, if you right click and open it in new tab, it opens the resized image, not the original one. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 12:15:21
Is there any way to hide the amount of BTC a public account has generated? Or, leave it to the user to decide? 
EDIT: Another question too. Is it possible to make the image clickable when someone follows the link? I'll give an example. The image in [this link]( (NSFW) is scaled so the visitor cannot see the full image unless he manually puts the .jpg in the end or I already give him the direct link. Being a wide image, it doesn't look good so if the user can click it to get the full version, that would be great. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:48:44
Just be patient.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:52:13
He should paint the roof white.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:37:50
There are no bitcoin pizzas in Albania :(
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:26:07
Yeah, I tried the btcclicks and it took me like more than half hour of clicking ads and waiting for the satoshis to roll into my account. When I made like 5$ I went to withdraw it and it said I needed like 0.1 BTC minimum to be able to withdraw. So, with the current rate I will need like half hour per day to be able to get 0.1BTC in one month approx.
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:07:24
I can't believe you took the time to check it. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:39:47
Yay, Lek is mentioned, my national currency. Coincidentally, I had to sign a form at the bank yesterday, confirming that I'm not a US citizen and that I do not have financial relations or businesses with the US in general. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:48:47
I'm already rubbing it on my brother's face.

I'm not Venezuelan but in my native language, Bolevar means Hung Testicles. Just thought to share this with you all. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:47:22
Nope, OP just reposted what has been around for years. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:49:05
No, it's not. Otherwise, why would they take only two letters from Samsung and 4-5 letters from each other company?

Is it possible to run a node on Raspberry Pi B+? I have one laying around and I want to put it in good use. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:38:34
My Galaxy S4 seems incompatible with the app :(
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:37:25
Well, if they don't deliver, no one will pay the ransom then.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:41:42
If you steal stolen goods, they don't become clean. You've just entered the chain of the criminal activity.

*checks username...* On behalf of all MtGox victims! 
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:58:17
Yes, it happened to a friend of mine a year or so ago and I was the only one familiar with Bitcoin in our group. After paying the ransom it reversed the process, decrypted the files and deleted itself. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 09:51:06
I'm trying to buy one as I have exactly that amount of BTC in my wallet but I can't seem to work out the posting/shipping procedure. I live in Albania and my in-laws are in Texas for the moment. They come back in three weeks and I would love to get one for the fun of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:45:41
The catch with Gox is that it is difficult to withdraw your dollars. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:41:33
Sorry for my stupid question but how do you cash out? I mean, you bought the car directly in bitcoin or sold them through localbitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:44:15
I'm currently mining ltc via CPU just for fun and to learn how the whole system works. It took me 3 weeks to generate 1 LTC which is like 3.5$ right now.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:41:20
Which country you're at? I suppose you can disclose that information.
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:34:39
Looks cool. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 19:44:39
How safe is it? AFAIK you can easily read a NFC tag. Therefore you could steal the info on it and use it. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:01:30
So, if I park on the other side of the road, with a camera, a telephoto lens and a laptop connected to the internet, I can take a look at the code generated on the LCD and thereafter steal the BTC. Wouldn't that be safer if the ATM prints a code or even better, generates the code after the user inputs a key at the moment? And then, your website can ask for the public key generated on the machine and the private key they buyer has. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:53:15
If Paypal adopts BTC, it will be THE game-changer. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 17:51:23
Well, isn't that on the other side of the globe?
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:00:56
I live in Albania. Will I be able to buy with a credit card or paypal? 
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:08:35
I always impress my friends when I show them mine. Also, when I check the balance with my phone via the QR code. I wish I could give them some. Would be a perfect gift. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 08:52:27
I tried to decode that but I couldn't. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:07:07
So, with current difficulty, 240 MH/s are like 1.25$ per day, right? (Just trying to calculate if this is profitable according to where I live where average wage is 200$ - 300$ per month)
@_date: 2013-07-29 11:52:48
I'm from Thailand, please tip me.
Jk, I'm from the other side of the globe.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:12:29
I'm writing this from tomorrow and right now you're already at 87$.
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:52:22
Don't bother calculating with Albania, I guess I'm the only one believing in Bitcoin around here. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:50:32
Paypal to Virwox and after buying SLL you can convert to BTC and send it to your wallet. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:03:12
Remember remember, the 5th of November...
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:44:02
I'm in Albania right now and since early this year I'm trying to spread the word regarding bitcoin. People look at me like I'm crazy. :(
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:34:03
Which pool is that?
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:17:49
Albanian reporting here. Are those mBTC still available for tipping? :D
