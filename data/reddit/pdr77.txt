You and couldn't be more accurate.  That said, I always read both.
Back to the OP though: I find myself questioning the assumption in   And I think this is something that Satoshi really predicted very well.  My own simple calculations ( seem to show that we can indeed scale bitcoin to "Visa levels" by doing the simplest thing over the next 20 years.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I really am now convinced that simple block size increases really will be able to keep up with demand.

I sold all my coins recently.  I bought a fair number of them many years ago when they were a few dollars each and have held them since.  But I didn't actually sell because of the scaling issue, which I think will be resolved sooner or later.  I actually sold them because of the fact that 0-conf transactions are now no longer trustable, making bitcoin much less usable, and hence less valuable (in my opinion).

It should be up to the market really, but one way to be sure you're safe would be to look at the cost of bandwidth/storage/CPU or some similar metric from, say, two years before. Let's say we choose the price of storage. So we then ask ourselves if Bitcoin was able to work two years prior. If so, then increase the block size to keep the cost of storing the blockchain constant.  So for example, according to  in the last two years, disk prices have gone down roughly by a factor of 1.4. So increase the block size by 1.4, wait two years, and repeat.  If we'd have done this since 2010 we'd probably already be at a few MB already.

Going from near zero mempool size to a large mempool size is completely explainable by even a small growth in the tx counts, once blocks become full.  There's no anomaly there, and both of you are correct.
That said, the current thinking is that this is not actually a problem, and the fee market will determine which txs make it into a block and which do not.
I understand the other side will say that this will escalate fees to the point of turning away potential users, but we are not there yet.  And limiting the number of users may also not be bad as well.  That's something you'll have to decide for yourself.

I believe it's possible, for two reasons:
* Technology gets cheaper/faster/bigger more rapidly than the world's population grows:
  * Population growth: 1% per year.
  * Technology improvements: 20-60% per year.
  * Demand may outpace technology for some time, but not in the long run.
* I don't see any empirical evidence (so far) that increasing the block size creates centralisation pressure:
  * Block propagation delays are already an issue, but block size doesn't contribute a great deal to that: latency != bandwidth.
  * Validation attacks are already an issue, but currently nowhere near economical.  I understand that this is a bit hand wavey, but if actual (not max) block size were to increase, then that's indicative that market penetration has increased, and that should lead to a higher price and keep these attacks non-economical.  There are also ways to mitigate these attacks (like 
  * As blocks have increased in size ( I don't see any increase in the orphan rate (
  * There's already zero economical incentive to run a non-mining full node, and, well, half of zero is zero.  People will still run full nodes for non-economical reasons, and in the long run they will cost less over time to run (but slightly more in the short term).
This is not even considering that there are other advancements that may help to scale bitcoin without resorting to off-chain solutions.
That said, I'm really happy to see some really great enhancements that have been released lately ( and I've been really excited about LN for some time now, and I'll be delighted when it's finally available!

Until RBF, for small transactions, the cost of attempting a double spend outweighed the benefit. As such they were indeed trustable.
@_date: 2016-03-04 06:51:37
So your priority is to keep block verification times the same. Ok, let's do this calculation then. 10GB blocks are 10000 times bigger. That's around 13.3 doublings. Moore's law has been declared dead more times than Bitcoin over the years, but let's say the naysayers are right this time and we slow to a doubling of price/performance every 2.5 years. That's still only 33.25 years.
@_date: 2016-03-04 16:56:33
Yes, exactly, but I just don't think many people actually bother to do it, and simply assume that it'll be hundreds of years.  And indeed, as you say, the centralization risk and cost also follow this same curve.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:57:29
Never is a long time.  I challenge you to "do the math" on this.  I did, and was really surprised by the result actually.  I calculated that in 20 years, by simply increasing the block size, bitcoin can scale to so-called "Visa levels" and beyond.  Until I actually sat down and did this calculation, I thought completely the same way as you.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:46:22
According to my calculations, 20 years is about right for bitcoin to be able to facilitate all the world's transactions.  Sadly, that means that we're not ready yet to fulfil this goal. (

Compared with many other open source projects, there really aren't very many contributors to the bitcoin code.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's not exactly a large codebase, but it is very sensitive code, so it's better to have only a few developers.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:57:35
It's not quite as simple as that.  Having everyone use bitcoin is not really the end goal, and is probably not possible anyway.  The main problem is the network/storage costs required to run a full node, which is currently around $5-20 per month, but would be around 10000x more if all 7 billion of us were using bitcoin daily for everything.  If we generously consider that hardware costs halve every 2 years, and $100 per month for a node is still acceptable, it'll still be 20 years before hardware will be cheap enough to support a blockchain for everyone on the planet; but this is sadly not the case today.  This means that Bitcoin, in its current form, cannot scale simply by ramping up the block size.  In any case, when bitcoin is the settlement layer, even if LN doesn't work in the end, it'll make end-user transactions (even through banks) much more efficient and we'll all benefit in the long run.

I used to work for one many years ago.  We never took any such loss.  We were one of the first to do chip-and-pin and the only reason we did it was to remove the ability for the customer to have any recourse at all.  If the card was used fraudulently either the merchant didn't look after their equipment or the customer told someone their pin.  No more "but I didn't sign for it!" excuses.  *sigh*  I wouldn't work for such crooks again though.
Edit: of course the irony was that 100s of petrol stations across the UK were compromised within weeks of chip-and-pin coming out (  But you can't stop progress when the regulators and banks are in bed together, so we all turned a blind eye and afterwards card fraud was as high as ever but banks no longer needed to care.

I would have thought that the time it takes to ship an ASIC from China is a bigger factor in miner profitability than the cost of power.

I'm not a "Classic supporter", but not a "Core supporter" either.  I'm not really even a "bitcoin supporter".  Just a "bitcoin early adopter and user".  But FWIW I have no problem with the so-called hard fork mechanism built into bitcoin.  In any case, you are likely right that the majority of large coin holders see it as a risk to their wealth.
By the way, I wasn't saying that bitcoinocracy was without value, just that it has some flaws, including bogus questions.  Sorry for not being clearer there.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:58:15


A good reason that a miner which doesn't use cAB might not want to support blocking it is because a coin which is willing to make PoW changes on a whim is less valuable than one that doesn't. Even if those changes are minor and done with the best intentions.
Of course I'd be surprised if cAB is not being used if it is indeed profitable.
@_date: 2016-02-16 11:36:41
bitcoinocracy is flawed.  Firstly, the responses are coming from a very small percentage of coin holders.  But critically, you can move your coins to a different address and vote again, ad infinitum.
Also, some of those questions are bogus anyway: the first one in your list, for example, suggests that if the trigger conditions for BIP 109 are met, it will create two separate coins, which is not true.  It means that, if not everyone upgrades in the grace period, there will very likely be two branches of the chain -- which happens from time to time anyway -- however clients who have not upgraded in the grace period will not recognise the other branch as valid and they will get a pop-up message telling them to upgrade.
@_date: 2016-02-25 10:50:30
My statement was more of a question really.  And there's some logic behind it.  Firstly, China's energy prices are not the cheapest in the world, so I'm thinking that's not the only factor (  And secondly, the most profitable period for a piece of mining equipment is when you first plug it in (a quick calculation shows that if it's non-profitable after, say, 7 difficulty rises, then the period before the first rise is about 25% of the profit).  So if there's any delay in delivery, even by a week, it can greatly affect profitability.

If all the miners are doing a calculation twice because that was the original implementation, and one miner comes along and works out that they only have to do that calculation once and save the result, is that an attack or an efficiency gain?
Either way, the solution (changing PoW, thus eroding trust in the market) is worse than the problem.
