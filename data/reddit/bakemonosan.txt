Actually navigated back to this page to check the punchline, might as well leave a comment.

Trick indeed.

Not so fast. Its still binding for anyone who read, sold the house and bought bitcoin before you edited.

You clearly doesnt support anyone. 
I bet you are not buying everything you earn in bitcoin.

Sure, so go ahead and do the same, ask to receive in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:17
Its waiting for me to buy some more to dip. Just wait until the 12th.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:29:08
How is this better than receiving the money and deciding its better to buy bitcoin at the time?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:50:05
I knew it! What is it called?

Im sort of an atheist, but i really like Bible Jesus.

Faith and money should not walk together.


There is nothing new here. This is the same as asking to receive in gold.

Witness me ^^^^hodl !
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:09:14
That would be wonderful, yes. Not the case, tho.

Like he wouldn't misspell cryptocurrencies.

His salary will fluctuate a lot more than 20 bucks getting paid in bitcoin.

I started looking into bitcoins (and bought a tiny piece) around may/2015 on a brazilian exchange site(BTCBRL). sold it, but kept checking for curiosity. [oh, hindsight, you got me again.](

Stop, dont remind me.

Its that fancy computer Sloan Sabbith gets in The Newsroom, isn't?
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:53:35
Doesn't sound very smart, either.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:27:12
Nice try caliber24p. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:25:17


What is this, amateur hour?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:18:46


If this was the saying, people would be more careful.

"as a service" is short for "cloud".

yes. you will see it go up and down. You can search online for the graphics on the value [like this one](
@_date: 2015-11-24 12:05:30
Get out of here to somewhere that doesn't do this? Its common practice.
