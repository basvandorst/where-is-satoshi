My ISP is actually an university that also provides internet connection to the student village where i live ATM. I wouldn't call them shitty, they're just very strict about any p2p or private server stuff.
How do I run a client over tor? I tried to install tor browser bundle and connect bitcoin via socks proxy on port 9150, but still only 8 connections.

I cannot be a Tor node (although I like to be one) remember that I'm behind firewall.

Yes. My ISP blocks all ports (except 22 and 993 I think) and they don't make exceptions.

Network admins have nothing against p2p or servers. Problem is that some warez idiots shared like thousands of gigabytes data inside and outside network and saturated it totally. This led to temporary down/uplink reduction to 10/10. Also lawsuits happened.
I wouldn't doubt that some of the admins use bitcoins and keep their own servers at their homes. They just don't have the choice but to block all ports that not so tech savvy people can use university network for suspicious activities.

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency. What is the point if in the future 90% of all the nodes are inside some huge data centers in US. This is not about the money. I'm not such a hardcore bitcoin fan that I'm going to pay for something I could do better at my home.

The point is that I don't want to pay anything. I have everything I need at my home: Necessary hardware, free electricity and lots of bandwidth. If running a full node isn't possible with this combination then I'm not going to do it.
