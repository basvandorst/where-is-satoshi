I love seeing the reddit traffic on my analytics page.  You people are all over the world.  Pretty neat.

Also, thanks for pointing out that it was taken down. Nothing irks me more than a dead link on my site.

Thank you phrenico!

There is an amazing amount of innuendo in insulation. :)  We are looking to expand to Kenai within two years. To better serve our customers from the peninsula as well as Valdez and homer.

Ah, now you have brought up a good point.  The efficacy of the bitcointip bot.
What if were to randomly award new subscribers  a "nth user surprise bitcoin payment"? This could potentially incite a viral ad campaign due to the rush of people jumping inline for a chance at a free 10 or 100 mbtc every week or so. Simlar concept behind publishers clearinghouse type mailings. You aren't sold a magazine subscription, you get @_date: 2014-04-04 06:03:39
If you are insinuating that I have given no forethought to this payment system, you are mistaken.  I have been in btc for 3 years, it has worked out very well for me personally and I see many reasons for implementing it into my business.

Great! We have a number of jobs scheduled for Delta this season.  I love the views of the Alaska range down there.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:54:01
Awesome! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:58:59
Haha you never know!
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:53:02
Done. It was not as simple as I had hoped, so we will see if it worked.

I like to go into the gold shops and argue my stance for btc to the old timers.
@_date: 2014-04-04 01:48:47
Alaska is highly libertarian and we believe in freedom of choice.  We love our gold and btc is the gold of the internet!

Yes, please put some Bitcoin into a new sidebar logo. It is juvenile and does nothing to benefit the sincerity of the protocol. 
Start a proper Adwords campaign. With a $50/day budget you could get a solid year of paid links rolling in from outside sites. Probably around 40-50 uniques per day. That's a bunch of publicity. Keep accepting donations and it may just pay for itself. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:02:36
We are definitely filling a void.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:38:42
Yeah, it has not quite made it around to construction services yet.  
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:36:40
That's about right.  You forgot bears and Sarah palin.

We are in Fairbanks, but serve most of the state.  Our product with the highest thermal performance is a 2lb closed cell foam @ R-7.4 per inch.  A 2x4 can achieve an r-value of 25.9.   The R-value of an insulation product is only part of the story.  Foam is also an incredible air-barrier as well as vapor barrier.  These characteristics make it far superior in R-value as well as resistance to convective air movement and vapor diffusion.  Request an estimate from our website and I will get back to you with a quote.

Just for fun, our first job in AK that is paid for in btc is 20% off!
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:04:20
I'd insulate you so damn good. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:47:03
:( That was a great video.  History Channel won't make it available on their own youtube channel.  Fools.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:35:39
Sorry, no hvac. Unless you want your attic duct runs insulated. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:54:59
Awesome! Thanks for the info, I hadn't seen it before.
