explains system similar to the way Paypal steps in to mediate after 30 days if one of the parties is not happy. the 3rd party "crypto mediator" would receive a 30 day delayed access to the escrow account for a transaction, which prevents extortion threat for bad actor mediators.

I think your correct,  seems like a long article to explain system similiar to the way Paypal steps in to mediate after 30 days if one of the parties is not happy.  the 3rd party "crypto mediator" would receive a 30 day delayed access to the escrow account for a transaction, which prevents extortion threat for bad actor mediators.

Its a step in the right direction.   In 10 years there may not be a driver in the car.

you earn 10% over market on localbitcoin   large enough to pay rent.  seems unlikely.

Very cool idea.  Thanks for the announcement.    
In places allowing Uber its not going to compete, but in cities were it is banned it could be great.  
Although it needs driver verification.   Could there be some sort of distributed identity verification for drivers and vehicles in order to facilitate ratings and bans?
