What "debate" can be had when these government goons come in and say "Do this or we'll throw you in a cage." Seriously. As long as government "regulation" comes down the barrel of a gun there is no reason to debate with these thugs.

Crypto-Currency is a hydra. Cut off one head and 2 more replace it. We will win, its just a matter of how long it takes.

What regulation "should look like" is keep your filthy government hands off my fucking property. As in. Fuck Off. We don't need you.

I started as a pretty bog standard copy of my parents beliefs then started leaning left when I got to college. I read a few books (Marx. Rothbard Etc.) and thought about politics and came to the conclusion that just because you get a group of people together who all say "These are the rules" doesn't mean that magically they become right. If tomorrow McDonalds came out and said "Only we can sell hamburgers" everyone would freak out but the government does the exact same thing with much more important services and everyone calls that normal. That also goes hand in hand with the fact that taxation is theft. Just because they force you to accept services does not mean you are obligated to pay. If I mowed your lawn without your premission that doesn't mean I can charge you 300$ for it since I "Provided you with a service". Similarly accepting money or services back from the government doesn't mean I agree to the system either. Another example being if I stole 20$ from your wallet and bought you a hamburger you wouldn't be a hypocrite for taking the hamburger AND no wanting me to keep stealing your money. If you want to watch some short videos that give much better explanations than I can I'd check out: [George Ought To Help]( [You can always leave]( and [Edgar the Exploiter]( These days I don't really talk politics because I mostly run into "You just want chaos" "Anarcho-Capitalism isn't really anarchism" and other one liners so I do appreciate your asking about my political thoughts in such a polite manner.

Go fuck yourself. Bitcoin was invented to get rid of this bullshit. You and your government goons can fuck right off.

Good to know I can come to your house mow your lawn and since I've provided you a service I'll just charge you 300$ for it. What you don't like that I've unilaterally decided to provide you a service? Well thats too bad try living somewhere else.

I'm a college student in Japan right now, for a project in my class I did a quick and dirty survey about Bitcoin. Most college age kids knew little to nothing about Bitcoin with adults even in the tech industry not doing much better. Japan's image in the west is one of high-tech goods and robots but in reality Japan lags quite far behind in terms of internet technology. Just take a look at any random Japanese website and you'll see just how far back they are. I would be interested in someone working with PASMO or SUICA to provide a bitcoin payment system but it might be hard to get them to adopt something as decentralized as Bitcoin.

Its an excuse to prosecute or preform random searches. "We have reason to believe that users from newyork have been using your services. Now either submit to a full search and hand over all records or cease operations." They know exactly what they're doing. Even if this only applies to New York is gives them a backdoor into any service because "People from new york might have used the service." Mark my words this is how it will go down. DarkCoin is looking pretty good right about now.

Sorry you don't get to decide who does and doesn't get to post. I'll keep posting so that people can see the tyrannical bullshit that people like Ben Lawsky are spouting. Feel free to keep defending the hand that enslaves you though.

Its so great that the people who claim unilateral power over others have the decency to ask how hard we'd like to be fucked before doing it! No it isn't. Fuck them and fuck their government goons.

The government shouldn't exist and no one has the right to steal other peoples property by deciding arbitrarily that its illegal. Just because you give it a fancy name doesn't make it any different from theft. Just like having a shiny badge doesn't make you any different from a thug. What you call it doesn't matter.
