I would need to have a different photo ID for each key I wanted someone else to verify. The whole point of a key is that the people who actually know who I am can say so. It's like an upvote.
All my family and friends could verify who I am. And all their family and friends could verify who they are, so on and so forth. Which would include everyone eventually. The more verifications/upvotes a person has, the more trustworth that person/key is. Repeat this until we can get a high percentage that reflects the majority and we're off to a good start.
Sure it's possible to create two keys, but without a lot of other key owners verifying the second key, what's the point? They would have to verify my photo ID matches my key. It wouldn't have any credibility in the system. It's like the blockchain. Everyone gets a copy of everyone else's public key.
Couple that with a flagging system that would let people flag untrustworthy keys/people and we'd have a pretty good system to improve upon. Anyone with multiple flags would have to be re-verified by a random third party chosen by the people.
Only people with say 600 upvotes or confirms from other keyholders can decide on issues or vote. [Average number of people a person knows](
Even with an 85% percent success rate, that's still a majority of the group that is allowed to vote/decide on issues.

Could you give me an example please? I don't think I grasp the question. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:05:54
600 people is a lot of trust when they're all different people from all over the country. And if the person records a 5 second video clip reading/writing their key, then it's globally verifiable. 
Then if keys are  distributed through a blockchain, then you wouldn't have to wonder if the key had been compromised, like on a hacked server.

And what if instead of meeting physically, we use a web video of the person physically reading aloud their key, so I can be verified remotely be people who actually know the person. My family could verify me over a long distance.

Isn't the whole point of this to bring back participation in our governing system? This would include meeting new people who share the same ideas. This technology just helps facilitate the practice.
Millions of people enjoy meetup.com, so I don't see why something as important as a key signing would be looked down upon, on the contrary, I see it as a group of people I want to know.
Current meetup stats from: [
*Members 15.92 million
*Meetup Groups 142,319
*Countries 196
*Monthly Meetups 315,827
*Monthly RSVPs 2.07 million
*Meetups Happening Now 8,479
We could just use meetup.com and organize keysigning parties that way.
As people get vetted, it's possible to trust others no matter where they live through the web of trust. So it seems like the best option available so far.

implementing a currency that is separate from any state or big bank's centralized system will allow the planet to stop feeding our money to these sick, greedy aristocrats who currently ru(i)n the world.  (cancer research money, food for African children money)

Nobody gets a photo of anybody.
Key signing parties have been going on for decades already.
If I were to meet you in person, you can look at my driver's license and verify I am RightOnTopOfThatRose because it says so on my license. And I'll do the same to you. My twin would have a different ID and key.
If I use the same key for everyone, then my key becomes stronger. If I lie and use a new key with different people, then that would make a weak key.
Only people with strong keys, that have been verified again and again, by different people, to accurately verify a physical person would have the right to vote and influence decisions in the system.
So the more verified your key is, the more heavily your vote is counted.

What about key signing parties? Where we meet up in real life and vet each other...
@_date: 2014-10-22 02:24:13
What is on your wish list? What specific dollar amount can we give you, as a community to help you? 
Can we make a kickstarter for you to hire help for a year? I'm not familiar with the structure of your network of help, forgive me. I'm just throwing out some ideas.
I want Bitcoin to go big, and I'd be able to donate about 10 bucks a month to help pay for a programmer to help you/Bitcoin. Maybe you already have a place we can donate that some of us are not  familiar with?
We can all chip in..right guys?

While this sounds great, I still feel like I don't care. Why? Because Bitcoin should not be regulated. The WHOLE POINT of Bitcoin is to move AWAY from legislation and regulation. Society should not be asking for regulations to be made on something that free's us from tyrants.
Free means free from rules. Rules and regulations limit freedom.
Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the planet, but not if it's just going to be turned into another regulated currency.
The Bitcoin dream is turning into a nightmare!

How? One person has just one key that gets signed by other people that know the person. Or am I missing something?

These coins should be marked unspendable on the block chain. While making them worthless, the rest of the coins in existence become more valuable for everyone else.

You think implementation and support of a peer based currency is a waste? This is more important for society than curing cancer.
Those african villages are already using bitcoin and in just a few more years they will likely use bitcoin more than we do in the states. And the fact that they won't be held captive by big banks is a HUGE deal. Their society will enjoy a free and unregulated currency that skips decades of trial and error in banking.
You say its a waste, I say it's the greatest innovation in our lifetime.

yes, I originally thought a track record on the net would be best,  but must be a physical verification against photo id. Plus,  my grandma doesn't Internet and should still have a vote. 
I don't mean to say votes outweigh other votes, they can't be more important,  that's unfair.  But the upvotes/verifications ensure that a key belongs to a real person, its more of a spam stopper to stop fake key registrations.

Thanks for posting! I'll be traveling extensively this coming year and I plan on blogging about Bitcoin from every country.
This tool will be a great resource.
You rock.

Travel intentions [
We're selling our car, and using tax returns to fund the trip. Should be around $10,000. We're couch surfing, and backpacking. I'm a web developer, so I'll be looking for side work along the way, and my partner is a polyglot, so he will likely be looking for work on Upwork, Elance, locals, etc.
Starting a Youtube channel, website, social media accounts, etc. 
I'd love to be able to use Bitcoin as some point during the whole trip. As far as how much I'll be spending in Bitcoin, I don't have any idea yet. Maybe I'll find interesting things to sell for BTC.??

Here's a small map of our intentions [

When you make less than $24K per year, and you only claim 1 or 2 on your tax forms, and you go to school, you get a tax refund.

All the more reason for developers to provide a link to the APK on their website... Away from google. 
Just as these developers have done!
