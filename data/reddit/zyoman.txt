Bitcoin can be compared to TCP/IP, allowing sign transactions and broadcasting them, confirming them. Anything like exchanges, vault, wallet are applications on top of TCP/IP. Color coins, payment channel is another greats examples that existed 6 years ago.

You can recover the BTC using the private key of the BCH address, they share the same code, it will work. If you created a HD wallet, you can actually have all the same addresses in both chains without any issues. While I heard this story here and there, I don't think this happened often. On the other hand, BTC lots do to transactions fee occurred every second.

Just like SegWit it's optional (soft-fork), so not required. That's part of a long debate soft vs hard fork.

Let's assume you find the right nonce on your FIRST hash! First, it's extremely unlucky considering there are trillions made before someone find it). It still takes you more than 24hr to compute it by hand and every time a new block is found you have the **start all over again**, so to win a block everyone else on earth needs to **not find a block in 24 hr**. I'm not a statistical pro but this is probably near impossible.

A payment channel does not imply LN at all. You and I can have a payment channel and constantly signing a transaction without broadcasting it. Only at the end you take it. It's a one way direction. If you want bi-directional you need 2 channel... just like LN did. The idea of LN is to scale that where you use someone else payment channel.

Thanks for your inputs.
1 &amp; 2. The hard-fork can allow a period of transaction where both types are valid. At block 10,000 transaction can be format  and format  (new). At block, 11,000 transactions must be format  or more. This is a good practice to do anyway as if a problem occurred with the new format, the old one can work and you have x block to release a patch.
3. Documentation will not **all be invalidated**. For instance, increasing the block size or including a new op-code would barely touch any guide. This is part of the process of improving a solution. If the only problem we have is outdated documentation to move forward... I can live with that.

A wallet may accept it but a merchant services provider like BitPay or Coinbase have more strict condition to accept 0-conf transaction. It's all a matter of risk. If some input are not confirmed or double spend is detected, they will wait a for a real confirmation.

The security come from the hashing power. The miners switch between chain to make the more profit as possible. So the security will come from the price. This has been the case for ETH/ETC and it's the same for BTC/BTH. If both coins get the same price, they will have equal security. Right now, Bitcoin [core] is about 5 times more secure!
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:16:09
After the deadline, nodes/miners reject the transactions! I still think it's better to have a few days of disruption where old client failed to send old format transactions than keeping the old format transactions forever. Read again the original text of this post... I think right now the NEW format transaction is less supported than the old one... and people complain that companies don't support it!
A hard work doesn't necessarily break everything. If you change the difficulty algorithm for instance... it's a hard fork but none of the transactions is affected by that. My point is that hard work should be considered!

It's funny how this negative interest rate is getting more and more common. The only thing that stopping them to go crazy is that you can keep some money under your mattress.

Miners are free by definition to include whatever transactions they want... including none of them. The fee is the motivation for a minier to include your transaction, if a particular miner doesn't get your transaction, the next block mined by someone else will be probably happy to take your fee.

From the dramatic reduction of space travel costs to potentially curing cancer with cloud computing, Goldman Sachs is dreaming big and wants clients to also.
Goldman's Robert Boroujerdi sent a report entitled "Themes, Dreams and Flying Machines" to clients Wednesday. In it, the strategist presented seven such predictions that may seem like pipe dreams to some, but the investment bank feels strongly enough about them that it is telling clients to put their investment dollars behind these trends right now.
The seven themes are:
- "The blockchain could disrupt everything."
- "Space is once again the new frontier."
- "College may not be worth it."
- "Gen-Z matters more than millennials."
- "There will be another Flash Crash."
- "Lithium is the new gasoline."
- "The cloud can help cure cancer."
Here's are a breakdown of the Goldman dreams that can be invested in right now...

You don't have to run the node from your home or be alone using that node. Just like SMTP server, there is usually more than 1 email per server. You could a bunch of friend that use the same node.

No it's still possible to do P2P. If you care about privacy, run a full node. If the other party also care about privacy and run it's full node... then you are really doing a P2P transfer.
That said, it doesn't make sense my mother to run a full node, that's probably for 1% or less of the population. I could say the same thing for email. I do have my own SMTP, while millions are fine with hotmail, gmail... and that's ok!
The miner client getting separated is another topic. Satoshi didn't expect dedicated hardware [that fast], but I don't think it's either a problem. The miners **WILL** take a big hit on the next block halving, and that will happen in about 1 year from now. The will received 12.5 BTC instead of 25... for sure many will stop mining, I would not be surprised to see the hashrate go down by 10-15%!
In a far future, I would not surprise to see most mining operation run by company with high interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as exchangers, funds, wallet provider. Not much for profit but for make sure they are trusting the network by contributing to a small percentage.
Edit: next halving is about 1 year as pointed by

I don't think it break anything related to security and decentralization when you have a million node and anyone can join it if they want. It's about efficiency and convenience.
The fact that today it's almost impossible to start a bank without huge fee, paperwork make us think it's a bad model. But having your grama storing their bitcoin on their own paper wallet, infected virus may not be the best solution either.

I've watched the whole video in French. Here is the highlight:
The panel is 7 peoples, only 1 for vs 6 against Bitcoin for my "feeling" of their comments.
* [Against] The Bank of France [Central Bank] is **very against Bitcoin**, calling it not a currency. Dangerous because not insured in case of fraud, danger of total collapse, high risk for commerce to accept it. He also concluded by telling how new credit card technique are safer and better.
* [For] The second to testify is Gonzague Grandval (**Paymium**) is starting by telling Bitcoin is not about the currency but the open source peer to peer technology. Difference between push (Bitcoin) and pull (Credit Card) payment. Then push for it's exchange portal **Bit-Central** claiming to safe, sound and compliant with banking rules.
* [Against] Third is Cornu, scientific director of the Next Generation Internet Foundation. He talk about innovation, relative Market Capitalizations, taxation difficulty and speculation. **He's not sure if Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme or not** because the first to mine get more Bitcoin (50 vs 25) and more often because there were less miner back then. Sound like an academic analysis.
* [Against] Fourth is François Marc General Reporter of France. He **seems to be lost and having more questions than answers** related to how Bitcoin is used for **bad stuff**. He ask questions if trades involving Bitcoin should be taxes, exchangers required to have a money transmitting license.
* [Against] Firth is M. Garcia Director of Custom. His governmental **agency did purchase Bitcoin and illegal drug** online and manage to trace and **arrest the guy**! They were in collusion with Paymium to do the arrest. He then talk about the risk of Bitcoin because of it's volatility.
* [Against] Sixth is M. Carpenter Custom "Cyber-Chief" [TRACFIN] he is worried about Bitcoin is **not fitting in the current legal system**. Is a bitcoin wallet considered an "offshore" account? LOL! Can an unregulated system really work? He doesn't realise that Bitcoin is no longer a joke and have advantage of no need for monitoring the infrastructure.
* [Against] Seventh is Amarzit, she works for the treasury (super long title). She start by acknowledging the low fees to both the merchant and use but other hidden fees related to security. She talk about it's currently attracting mostly **libertarians**. Bitcoin is **not a threat to the market stability**. There is problem related to trace individual because they are not identified.

TCP/IP was among the first free to use without any royalties (software and hardware manufacturer). They don't die easily like you pretend. IPX and Token Ring for instance didn't scale well in a planet size.
TCP/IP maybe not be the best, it will be hardly replace because it's in used in so many software, routers, OS... Just look how IPV6 struggle to make a dents in IPV4. It will take another decade until will probably be 50/50 between the 2.
Bitcoin is not perfect, many alt-coin improve over it, but that will not make Bitcoin fade away; because a protocol is hard to change when it's in used everywhere (miner, full nodes, gateway, integration, hardware).

A hard fork is when the basic rule change where you can no longer accept previous block.
For instance, lets say we want the new block to be worth 5 BTC instead of 25 and be 5 times faster. Since the reward is not the same, old client would not accept it as valid, and new client would not accept the old 25 BTC valid. That would be a hard fork.
From block "X" (like 20,000) the new client would be the "real" valid and other rejected.
The concept of hard fork is very theoretical and very unlikely to ever occurred:
* Implies that the majorty agree on the new protocol
* Implies that those that didn't upgrade get fool by the old protocol since they are worthless (you accept coin you will not be able to spend).
* Implies that all clients, miners, full nodes, processors, exchangers, hardware wallets, everything related to bitcoin updates!
All that is very unlikely and purely "academic" from my point of view.
Just like the email protocol was bad and full of problems and dozen of good upgrade were propose and never got in used because they were all breaking the current email protocol.
What WILL happen is: 
- Update on TOP of the bitcoin protocol, Etherium, Counter Party, Color coin and many project will run on the top of the existing protocol rather than creating a new one on the side.
The same way we can send by email, images, PHP encryption and various stuff without changing the email protocol at all.

Thanks arhag for your good arguments and time to explain your points; I've read them all they all make senses. 
Satoshi decided to give his works for free, he never use his bitcoin and probably never will (who knows?). He designed it so other that join can participate and be rewarded. 
Having someone who invest early with risk or give time without getting pay for reward is perfectly normal. That just doesn't fit well that much with open source, distributed currency in my head.
The POS initial launch is more like selling a software. How much money can we raise by selling our initial coins After that, who care; this is little insensitive to run it. 
- How many full node exists on Bit Shared? 
- Who was the biggest owner at start?
- What % of the coin the top 100 users own?

The time is proportional to the number of confirmation requested. Each confirmation takes on average ~10 minutes. So in that case the company probably set 6 confirmations... somethings incredibly secure. 
If anything require some physical shipping; 0 confirmation is ok because before the package is out of the building the transaction will be know to be confirmed or not. 
In case of digital good, if it's less than 1000$, 0 confirmation is just fine; nobody will do a double attack for a small amount.

"Furthermore, regarding card payment transactions, real-time authorisation transaction systems guarantee the 
payment to the payee."
Guarantee but we can do reversal for weeks after the transaction.
"The risk arises because no authority oversees the settlement process: instead the process is 
based on trust"
No, Bitcoin is trustless. You only have to trust yourself. Not sure they really understand the "push" vs "pull" difference.

I don't like that. but logic tell me...
Concerned of what? they invested millions of hardware, facility, monitoring infrastructure and they would blow that away for what? A single double spend attack before we forked them? They would filter transactions? The next block would take them... be their own unique chain and overflow everyone else? 
They want the milk from the cow, not the meat. I don't see why Discus Fish would create any issue with the Bitcoin network. But even that, in 1 year from now a new ASIC chip will be out and another company will build another Mining data center that will take over discus fish.

Please tell me what line of code to fix. Perhaps you can submit a pull request... it's open source!
The mining process is a core fundamental of Bitcoin. You can't change it like that, the same goes for the 21 millions coin limit. Changing the core protocol means breaking all existing mining software, all wallet software, all processor software. 
The same problem occured with email, many had great idea of to fix email spam, but they all required a change in the protocol, something that can't be done at the stage we are.

I agree that for now, if you only use fiat for pay grocery and gas station this is little incentive. Try to move money overseas you will **definitely** want to use bitcoin.
I did received money twice from central america to Canada. For a ~5k USD transfer I've got:
- Wire transfer: took 5 days, cost me about 150$ in fees with USD to CAD conversion by the bank.
- Bitcoin transfer + Vault of Satoshi deposit in my bank account: 1 day, 6$ in fees...

Don't confuse the blockchain with the private key. The blockchain is the list of all transactions that ever occurred on Bitcoin. This information is fully public and replicated hundred of thousands of time around the world.

Not touching the transactions in the past is a non-issue. Any fork, by definition do not touch old transactions. The problem is with the future transactions.
Lets say you add something great to bitcoin, a new feature, a new unit, something super cool. This super cool thing is part of the transaction. If miner and full node to not process you super cool add-on either it will be treat as a normal transaction or just rejected as a malformed transaction.
So changing all miners, all full nodes, all exchanges, all POS, all hardwares wallet... at this point is **already near impossible**. Bitcoin is locked there unless it's a very subtle changes that everyone accept.
Does that means Bitcoin can't evolve? **Of course not!**
The IP Protocol that routed message for the internet (IPv4) having change really since it's conception. People build stuff on TOP of it. tcp/ip, http, https, websocket...
Bitcoin have a long way to go, nothing hurry, nothing must be rushed (like MtGox). We already won.
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:50:46
I think the miner care about 1 thing, make profit from their investment. They have no incentive to disturb or make double spend attack at all. Also if you follow Bitcoin for a while you will understand that the "top" mining pool is changing regularly. I remember when BTC Guild was too big, then another, then GHash no it seems that Discus Fish is on the top. 
An article from 1 year ago, same arguments and yet Discus Fish was not even on the radar...
- The 50% mining controls the new transactions that are arred. Not everything. If most node reject what the miner do, they are obsolete. And there is a lots of full node around. The same way you can mine alt-coin XYZ and if nobody accept your coin it's worthless.
- I don't think Bitcoin mining is that centralized when compared to other alternative.
- But in the long run; the reward will be smaller and I think the mining race arm will slow down.

The "waste" electricity secure the network. It's a self regulated market where if it not profitable miner stop their machines. I think the POS doesn't work because all the coins are given at start then number grows; the ratio is still the same.
So many people cry against bitcoin "problems" such as transaction limit, confirmation time too long, blockchain size increase and wasted electricity. I think none of them are issue at all. Even if the blockchain get a 1 TB, so what, not every cell phone will run a full node. Being able to be your bank for a 1 TB hard drive is not a big deal.
Mining is overate and oversaturated, people still received their asic from old orders; when they finally received them they plug them to realized 6 months later they made little to no profit. Time will fix it and stabilized... Also when the rewards will half to 12.5 BTC (instead of 25) I expect the hash rate to drop by 20-30%.

How many transactions were reversed because of a longer chain/fork? Not much; I would say generally it's true. With the constant increase of the hashing power; the fear to get your transaction confirmed and then reverse are very very unlikely.

There is no rush to go faster than the framework that is currently getting developed.
- If we are going too fast, some companies will be "Goxed".
- Funds will be lost or stolen.
- We need multi-sign addresses used a lots of more.
- We need new people to understand how bitcoin works and why it's working that way.

No, the re-target is around 2 weeks, if you have 10% of the hashing power it will take 20 weeks before the difficulty is adjusted. Most alt-coin have very short retargeting; that's not the case of Bitcoin and that's a strong factor that limit the forking.

Proof what? It's basic math about block time and retargeting. The current. 10min would be longer depending on the hash rate. If you have 10% of the hash rate it will take on avg 100 min per block. And the retargeting would jump from 2 weeks to 20 weeks  
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:22:59
Sorry I didn't explain myself properly. When a block is found, the pool operation create immediately a new header with the newly found block so it's valid and broadcast it right away so all the miner stop working on the old one and work on the new one. 
Then the pool check for all the unconfirmed transactions (can be thousands of them), sort by priorities, fees, validate then create a new block header to be broadcast to the miners inside the pool. 
What happens once a week, is a miner find the block before having the second block header that include transactions.

I can send an email from Bob to Alice and it will deliver in your inbox. The from and to in the email have NOTHING to do with the actual sender and recipient of the content of the email.
* You can receive an email even if your email not in the "to" because you could be in the CCI. The server that received the email have no way the real email is send, he may think your only in the CCI recipient.
* You can receive an email with a from that is not the actual from. Thanks to the super lossy specification where this is no signature, the authentication is rather ridiculous simple to none and it's mostly never validate against the from of the email. So yes, you can authenticate as compagnie ABC.com and send an email with a from DEF.com without any problem. Some ISP will reject it but not all do the verification.

Who own the initial 2 billions "XTS"? Then there is no new XTS created really, because everyone get proportionally new one. That's is an effective 0% inflation rate since the amount relative to the total is the same. So it is, in my head, 100% pre-mined coin.
Yes yes, I don't get it and the coin is useful for other thing, just like etherium and other companies (because ethereum IS a for profit company). But the fees and all the underling system work with the coin so that's very important.

How many different networks they will be?

I don't think the statement is true, I've been in many debate with technical argument and hard forking is possible, has been done and is getting done in other alt-coin. The problem is that most discussion here are getting censor so this sub see only part of the debate thus considering that everyone is onboard. Core dev team has more money because it's being funded by company like Blockstream who have a business model in LN so it's normal they are pushing toward that technology and nothing else. In my book, they are in full conflict on interest. Any proposal that is not from the core team is marked as all-coin, as if they were god.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:07:21

Did you use bitcoin back then? They were not 100% safe but they were very reliable. You could start processing the order and check on confirmation before shipping. The number of time after you check **does matter**. If 5 minutes after you see the transaction broadcast no other transaction have the same input, you knew the transaction would go in and not double spend as nodes and miners use the timestamp of the transaction... not the fee as right now. The fee should be a way to priority your transaction, not to prevent it to get in at all like we have.

SegWit alone will never pass, there is chance in the world the network get 95%. Time to check for alternative plan and with a 2MB hard fork I'm pretty sure we would get 50%+ of the support.

Bitcoin in its current state is not designed against a 51% attack. The idea of decentralised mining is that nobody alone can get 51%+ of the hashing power and do nasty thing.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:28:50
TPS will increase if SegWit is activated but that will be slowly and limited.
Only transactions from 'SegWit' special anyone-can-spend addresses will be counting toward size reduction. Normal transaction will take the same space as right now. Over time, maybe wallets, exchanges and software may use those addresses leaving a little bit more space to pack more transactions in the same 1MB block. Viewing at the speed that everyone upgrades, it may take few years to get the 2-4 MB limit.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:05:05
The thread was about been "stalled"... SegWit is stalled REGARDLESS of BU (stop saying BU is blocking because it's wrong). It need 90% and both combined are not close to get it. BU on the other hand have a steady increase in support among the miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:55:24
That would be a very interesting scenario from the experimental point of view. The secure chain rejected and the unsecure chain living. I guess the situation would not stand long. Either miners would change chain or the exhanges would accept both.

Nop, but doesn't mean it can't happen. Having multiple implementations is re-assuring because there is less chance they all crashed at once. 
Edit: I would not have see it myself because normally assert are harmless in release mode (only in debug). Bitcoin is build in a way they are always active and doing a pop-up... Maybe the dev didn't knew it also.
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:40:35
The minority cannot fork again easy to adjust the difficulties as you suggest. Forking is months of planning and months of deployment. You can't just fork and expect the next day everyone to have upgrade... that would most likely create a 3rd chain. Especially considering that client that didn't upgrade in the first place may have technically issue upgrading their system or are just "zombie". Almost 20% of the nodes are outdated 
BU cannot fork "any minutes" as you said. The first miner that mine a block over 1 MB need the almost certainty that other miner will mined of top of it and that would be the longest chain or else it would be discarded as invalid (you don't loose 12.5+ BTC for fun like that). 
You can run a BU and still say that you don't accept block over 1MB... in fact **100% of the miners not accept &gt;1 MB block while still running BU**. 
The miner can decide what is acceptable or not; it's the AD/EB settings.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:18:01
Some are clearly saying they have no intention to hard fork.
If you are waiting on SegWit to do something, you may get wait a while, only 1/4 of the miner support it and required 95%.

Bitcoin is based on Game Theory and miners hashing power. If 75% of the hashing power want something, I'm sorry to tell you but it's the "real" chain. No matter the outcome, I would follow the chain with the most hashing power because it's the most secure one. If the biggest chain is that evil, it could also redirect their hashing power and do double spend on the minority chain anytime they want. Better be on a safe chain with not everything you want that be on an insecure chain.

A PoW change is literally a new alt-coin as you start with almost 0 security. I don't think for all the ideas propose the PoW would be doable. CPU based hash? How about someone rent a 1 millions cpu botnet for 2 hr to mess up the chain? You can't do that with ASIC...
Hashing power do not take over the chain as we all know exchanges, company, atm, wallets, users need to also agree on the new rules but on the other side I don't think you can change without the miner unless you fork yourself away in a new coin starting back to 0.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:33:02

If the NSA get more than 51% of the hash power it's a huge problem!
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:12:07
Having the "idea" is not new, by implementation is a lots harder. Bitcoin do not have balance, it's input and output and signature. How can the merchant pay the fees? he would have to including his input in the transaction and sign it? That would required a whole new protocols of communication between the client and merchant with multiple signatures.
It's MUCH more easier to have the client pay the normal fees. Then the merchant can accept the transaction at 0-conf if the fees are normal... else you wait!
[Edit] typo
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:22:52
I think it's real, but I don't if we already have 3¢ fee per transaction at the stage we are, we didn't win on the fee size for sure.

re-targeting will create a 3rd fold, not everyone will upgrade overnight plus the minor chain is still in danger of double-spend or malicious from the major chain... not a great scenario.
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:58:24
See? so you are now reassured that the network cannot fork anytime soon. Bitcoin is resilient to change and it's a good thing! We would not want a gov or big company to change the rule soo easy. Consensus is hard to reach because there is no authority. I still think that bitcoin an experimental currency. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:59:30
Why would it "destroy" Bitcoin.. the most likely scenario is that one of the chain within days because of the retargeting of difficulty is soo high (2048 blocks of 10 minutes). The only nightmare scenario would be to hard fork at 50%... and nobody sane would do that. Miners will fork with 75% of the hashing poker to make sure the other chain follow up.

The problem come from the 95%. Why not 99.99%? It's too hard to get that many both agree and upgrade. That's why 51% was designed. Satoshi wrote it clearly to always follow the longest chain to resolved conflict. That said I'm not saying that BU is the ultimate solution. We had simple 2MB HF proposed by classic and was rejected and ridiculed... now we live in fear that HF can't be done but stuck with insane approval rate.

The best case scenario involves also having higher than 10 minutes blocks for 2048 AFTER the retargeting!
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:12:23
The name is pretty irrelevant for me, I was referring to the fact that the chain with the most hashing power is the most secure one. Usually people/wallet/company would go for that one. Nothing prevents users to stay on a minor chain but you could get attack by the majority chain with double spend or empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:48:20
It does... sorry you just learn it today.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:11:09
Hard fork can push updates with much lower than 95% as SegWit required... you can basically do it at 51%... obviously you prefer a way so everyone know it will be done with signalling. 
I'm surprised what part is a lie? Do you think it's a lie that other cryto currency took part of bitcoin market share? Of the lie that if the situation would have improved (blocksize issue) we would still be in the same situation?
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:25:22
Nobody sane will fork without assurance that the fork will be the winner one. Because the retargeting of difficulties in 2048 blocks there is little chain any minority chains even survive.
Crazy chart about Bitcoin vs other alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:12:50
I don't know/care. My point is saying 90% want's SegWit and 3% BU is misleading considering that most want a HF and the whole point to reject BU is because HF are "evil" and "bad". I think, that many agree that HF was the original way to update the software and should be consider.
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:01:06

The "best" for Bitcoin may differ from person to person. 
- Some think that $1+ fee per transaction is fine. 
- Some think a persistent backlock is fine.
- Some think 0-conf transaction should never be used
- Some think Bitcoin should be used only for big transaction and smaller should be done in sidechain/LN
- **Some don't think the same**
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:50:42
It's funny because the main argument to not handle too many transactions is to have full nodes easy to run... by common people, be decentralised as much as possible. Yet the inverse logic applies to have the network only used by the big one for big transactions as a settlement layer.
I do agree with you that not every micro transaction can be handled on the main network. But I think we can handle a lot more than right now.

At 25% it will take up to 56 days until the retarget. If that occurred before that, the retarget would still be higher and lead to another set of 2048 hard to do block. I'm pretty sure this would be a major setback for anyone who stay on the slow chain 40+ min on average for block confirmation.

If you accept the fact that fee are ever increasing and will increase even more. That transaction get delayed by hours and something doesn't get confirmed at all... no there is no capacity problems. Yet you are promotion SegWit a capacity increase...
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:27:03
I can counter it easy, assert(0) do nothing at all in release (if the writer know C++ he would have known that). Also in Bitcoin Core there is many of them... just picking a random file with 2 of them.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:11:05
Sight, it's not because you run BU that you accept block over 1MB. BU pool right now do not accept block over 1MB... read my other comments bellow. BU has **configurable settings** on what is acceptable or not. SPV mining has little to do because you get your job from the pool miner that decide what is valid or not.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:36:25
The empty block represent 1% of the total block, it would have the same affects as increasing the block to 1.01MB... nothing. Empty blocks are not new, they have been there since the start.

We need a much as possible "on" and "off" ramp of bitcoin. It doesn't matter if it's cash, wire, credit card, gold. The more way people can buy or sell the best we are.

Shapeshift fee:
- 1 BTC =&gt;  310.8713755 LTC
- 310.8713755 LTC =&gt; 0.98845 BTC
about 1.15% fees + you still get the transaction fee of BTC so you are  not really winning anything.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:26:07
Agree but the definition of "valid" or "invalid" transaction is defined by the code. As far as I know BU has the same validation for **transactions** as core. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:06:59
0conf were pretty reliable before block were full.
- The first transaction seems was included in the block. Before RPF was added.
- So if you wait a *couple seconds* and if no other transaction is broadcast in the network with the same input... you are pretty sure there is no double spend. Blockchain.info would give you a warning if a double spend was in place for instance.
- Now with full blocks, even a perfectly valid transaction with no double spend can get lost because there is not enough room for all of them. No matter how much everyone paid, a % will be dropped.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:08:03
In the current LN implementation know if you need to open a channel or not? Or the fee, how is that presented to the users?
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:17:09
mempool tend to increase over time as there is more transaction than what is getting processed.
But on the week-end it's always calm so the mempool clear up.
How do you define attack or spam transaction? What's the purpose of that?
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:35:48
They don't have to "agree" or collude. It's not economically viable to mine right now because the difficulty is/was the same as Bitcoin and the price is 10-20%... it's **selfish profit as Bitcoin was created**.
If you had mining machine, you would point them to the coin that gives you the most money. Only a few will mine based on their ideological views... most just want to make money.
Edit: Hash rate ALWAYS follows the price... see the history of price and hash rate for ETH et ETC.

This is a FAN page. Not the real guy. Top left of the screenshoot.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:51:51
You nailed it, the current price does not reflect the future price. If you pay right now 20 Satoshi/bytes, a new series of transactions can be added on top of you and leaving your transaction unconfirmed. That's called unreliable confirmation. There is no such thing as "pay x and you will be always confirmed". Since there is a quota, by definition, some transactions will be left behind no matter what price everyone paid.
Edit: I'm not sure why you call 50.5 Satoshi/byte "piddly", it's been respectable fees for more than the average of the transactions made... maybe 5 Satoshi/byte would be "piddly" ?

@_date: 2017-08-02 14:48:25
I think we are sort of both "right"
The code say the difficulty increase by 1/4... as in the comment. But since it's an increase, the difficulty would be 1/5 of what is was previously. It's easier to see the other way around (as difficulty increase means easier to find block).
1000 **increase** by 4 times = 1000 + 4000 = 5000.

yes I know, that makes me believe they have issues with their pool software logic and/or distribution of block headers. A miner client could also have miss the new block header data and still working on the original empty block. If by miracle this miner find a valid nonce, the pool will publish it... empty or not.

@_date: 2016-12-16 18:24:14
They don't do empty block because they really want to. It's because they systems is not efficient to relay full block information to miners! It's usually happens when a block is found very quickly after another. In their case, it's happen more often.

Is there a web site that generate this? can you share it? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:40:39
Yes, it's possible, but some clever guy will actually take the transactions to get the fees as a reward... it was intended that way. If your fees are too low the miner can discard your transactions. The fact that ALL miners process NO transactions is totally ridiculous, as they know now a currency without transfer is not a currency, their own newly mining coin will go down. I think you are just paranoid over a couple empty blocks. AntPool has shitting mining software and produces empty blocks here and there...

You are correct about RBF (I apologize), the problem is how you define "adequate fee" at some point in time 10¢ was ok, then 1$, now 5$ is not sure... Even if you check right now was is an adequate fee how to know if the fees won't goes even higher? 
If the bus pass even 10 minutes and pickup 40 peoples ordered by how much they willing to pay, it's pretty hard to say:


By definition, the quota will **prevent some transactions to get's in**. The transaction log is so big for so long, I wonder if it goes down because old transactions get dropped from the mempool. 
Let's hope LN works at advertised, lets hope wallets, exchanges and merchants adopt it. Is there a site that list the progress of transactions using SegWit to track it?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:08:51
We said the same thing, CC confirmation != Bitcoin confirmation... when I swipe my CC card at Costco in a few second they have a pretty good chance the transaction is correct, that's what they called a confirmation. With Bitcoin unconfirmed transaction used to be good, but now with the backlog, they can be dropped, now with the RPF they can reverse... so we need to wait to be confirmed in a block (or more).

Litecoin is a copy of Bitcoin, why use the copy and not the real one? Despite years, Litecoin never picked up but nothing was added there as an improvement.

Unless you are storing millions of dollars, I'm pretty sure everything you wrote above is perfect or even overkill.
My suggestion for paper wallet is create 2 or more of them using the same process.
Then burn one for testing (0.01 BTC?) if it's working before transferring the money to the others.
Transferring "some" money out of a paper wallet is both unsafe and dangerous as you must send back the change to the same address.

Greece moving to Bitcoin from a goverment point of view would be terrible and would not solved anything.
Remember their idea is to **print** more and more money. While they can't print a single Bitcoin they would have to purchase them. Worst, starting to pay the salaries and pension of everyone would probably increase the price of Bitcoin even more.
So **no** there is no chance in the world that Greece would move to Bitcoin.

- Limit increase or decrease may not exceed 2x in any one step.
- The value took is the value 80% the miner agree on. 
Ex 10 miners vote: (0.5,1,2,2,4,4,8,8,20,100)
the block would 2MB because the first 2 values are dropped.
- The total max block size would be 32MB.

@_date: 2017-04-13 14:54:21
I'm all for LN, what I'm against is blocking the current network. The idea that hard fork can't be done is FUD. Fixing malleability and increase the blocksize at once would be the best. Don't tell me SegWit is a blocksize increase because it's a limited blocksize only for some transactions and adding a huge technical depth and complexity that we can't fix after.

Relative to what it was. Use a pay a couple cents and if the transaction was valid and no double spend, it was accepted as 0-conf. Now, even valid transaction can't be accepted because we don't know if it will goes into any blocks as they are full. The meta-game have changed for the worst.

The Bitcoin classic original proposal has expired, the flag mechanism is not longer working/relevant. They have basically followed other forks that have a similar goal (increase block size) such as Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC. They had a cool tech call FlexTrans to do what SegWit does but in a cleaner and hard fork way but since SegWit is activated, this is no longer relevant for Bitcoin.

Selling mass amount of btc like that would drive the price down. Also at some point the coin will be know where they come from. In all case, i think it would be good for btc in genral and make a safer world. At some point he will run out of money.

a bubble is when the price is more than the real value. For instance in the dot.com bubble company had super high profit/value ratio, or during the housing bubble the price was clearly increasing more than the cost to produce new one.

I'm not sure LN will help decentralization. To work somehow efficiently there should not be too many "hop" between 2 users. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool tech, but I think it will be rather used for smallish transactions such as buying songs, in-game items, coffee. 
I'm also not sure why increasing the block size would be bad in the long term;  as you said the eco-system is small and agile, it's a good practice to hard-fork and forces everyone to upgrade once in a while without any risk of losing money (your client just stop working). Anyway, time will tell, I'm thrilled to see what's next coming for Bitcoin!

I'm sure that trading a single BTC using that many would cost around 5-10%... if you can afford that! BTC-e deposit and withdrawal would be faster and probably as efficient as they would not share the database with US official.
Edit: I've made the calculation
* 1.00 BTC = 156.4757 LTC
* 1.00 LTC = 1.30411111 BTCD
* 1.00 BTCD = 0.00392479 BTC

I have a few questions because a coin backed by ANYTHING implies a lots of risk and cost.
- Who will pay for the fees of those storage vault? 
- Who will pay the employee when doing withdrawal? 
- What are the term for withdrawing? minimal amount? fees? 
- Who can change the fee? anytime they want?
- What happen if one of the vault got stolen/confiscated by a government? who will repay for that? or the coin are not 9x% convertible? 
Bank robbery did happen, do happen and will happen, in a system like bitcoin nobody else than the victim is affected. In a decentralized redeemable system, everyone is affected, and nobody will ever stand up and pay for something bad that happen for the best of everyone.
Setting the gold in "Free Trade Zone" is a good idea, but how many around the world there is? Are they **all** 100% safe from confiscation?

The problem is receiving money... try to send $1 to a friend, or get refunded from a store. A currency that works only 1 way is not good.
Also the fact you can only send make it easy because you don't have any fear that the other party will broadcast the transaction in the old state (you always send so the old state is always better for you).
If you can send and received, now you need realtime backup, node watcher and if you change IP, close and re-open all your channels. 
It's that the final model for LN? I hope not!

If transaction would be twice fast, you would need twice the confirmation for the same security. And then a single confirmation would be even more risky than today's one confirmation. Alt-coin with very low time between block would have a LOTS of orphan block **if** their network hash rate be as fast as Bitcoin.
That said, there will be service that will tell you if a transaction is fine or not. Before the first confirmation, within 10-20 sec, you can check if a double spend is on the run. You can check if there is transaction fees. Then you are pretty sure it will pass eventually.

This is not rare or unusual. It's happen statistically from time to time. Understand that some transaction DID occured during those 7 seconds but more miner works with mining pool, received jobs to do from a central computer. 
- When a new block is found, an empty (no transaction) block header is send to all the mining machine in the pool so they could stopped working on the old already solved block and do some useful works.
- Then the central computer, process all the pending transaction with priority rules, recreate another block headers that would included transactions and fees.
- The processed is repeated from time to time to having a block "up to date" with recents transaction.
- By luck a miner can find a solution before receiving the 2nd block header with some transactions.

First, I really don't care about Asic Boost at all, in fact, I'm not particularly in love with BU but rather with increasing the capacity of on chain scaling and long term view. I see SegWit as failure because it can't get activated and I see no good reason to not increase the Block as 2MB like Classic proposed for instance. My argument was a counter to the fact that your original message refers to "compromised" while I see little from the Core team. Good luck with  I'm pretty sure that will solve the cause and create 2 chains.

I'm more concern about the centralization with LN channel, with the current infinite backlog, at some point we may not even be able to open and close channel often leading to super hi concentration of channel and very little settlement. Those channels will mostly be run by a company who are even easier to coerce by the gov. Decentralising node is important but not as critical as you point it. Even if 50% of the nodes are wrong, the good data will pass easily. Plus if there is censorship, new mechanisms will emerge the pass the information. Information is very to go on the internet obfuscate... think about the great wall of china.
That said, I'm not saying solution X is perfect or the only solution, but keep our head in the sand and praising Core team for not increasing the block size sound odd to me.

@_date: 2015-03-13 10:02:06
- The mining without the reward does not work because there is no incentive to mine. 
- The blockchain without the mining does not work because it's not secure.

2. A fix date HF is very dangerous. I'm sure he would support a 8MB with some activate mecanism.
4. SegWit need 95%, I call that vaporware and with Jihan or not it's irrelevant as 30% of the miners don't signal anything... they are the one blocking.
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:53:56
We both know that if a change is proposed and people don't like it, it will not go live as merchants, exchanges and users would not use the newer version. HF required a high percentage of acceptation and that's a good thing to prevent a situation like you described. I don't see how a team would be 100% control of bitcoin to change something like that. BU team is just a bunch of programmers, they don't control Bitcoin mining at all! Miners are not for 21M cap... I haven't heard a single of them that want that. 
Some BU figure may talk about it, as some core figures propose to [lower the block size]( to 300kb... that doesn't mean they will do it and even if they do it, we both know it would not be accepted.
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:28:14
No compromised from BU? You must be kidding, BU adapt to any size including the current 1MB size. Core team is the team who failed to compromise rejecting the 8MB, the 4M then 2Mb and even 2Mb HF + SegWit are they proposed in the original agreement. You can blame BU for SegWit failing to get 95% but the reality is that even if 100% BU supporter vote for SegWit it would not pass. The requirement by itself is way to high and many miners prefer neither solution. **Maybe it's time for Core to compromised and offer something else.**
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:25:33
Thanks Auwardamn, I appreciate your input and I agree with you but 
- SegWit is not getting activated as expected because 95% can't be reached. (as said in another comment, getting 95% of the parents agree to where we will do the baseball party of the kids is also impossible).
- Size bump is needed anyway, 2nd layer involved or not. There is no need to have the network crippled like that.
- I do fully agree with Quadratic hash fix and it should be included in the block size since both required a hard fork. I'm surprised Core didn't propose something like that. 2MB + Quadradic fix + Malleability fix. I don't see why that would not be widely approved by all communities and it could be done with 75% safely as those who don't upgrade just have their client stopped working... update and it's all good. 
LN is cool techy stuff, but I don't think everything is ready for that. Also it worked best where many many actors are involved in it. If I get paid in bitcoin and need to withdraw it and my exchange want's a non LN transaction I need to close the channel costing another transactions fees. When LN will kick start this situation will happen a lots and we still need layer 1 to be efficient. Over time, you may found yourself in a situation when you no longer have to close your channel to move the money again but send it again in the LN.
LN nodes are direct form of centralization, source code available or not, to have an efficient network you cannot have a 10,000 channels and each of those nodes knows all your transactions. In some cases it not bad, I wouldn't mind using Starbuck LN node know all the coffees I buy if I get freeish transaction fee. 
Increasing the block size do put more burden on the node, but will also likely allow more users to participate and they may run a node too. If computer cpu/memory/bandwidth... increase by X% every year, why the blocks can't follow the same kind of path? I'm running full nodes for years and I can barely notice it running on my computer while working... that's a pretty low requirement to be a bank!

@_date: 2017-05-17 13:03:47
I see your point. In that case, one chain will be smaller than the other and at some in time miner will stop one chain and go with the longest one. Your node will stop working and you will figure it out. If SegWit gets activate tomorrow, trust me all BU fan would upgrade and move on from there, there is an advantage to stay on the minority chain because it's very likely to die especially in Bitcoin because of the very long retargeting time. 
Asking you again, if we can't use the longest chain to validate new protocol change, how do you suggest we solve that?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:05:12
While BU having an issue or not with an optionally optimised protocol change little to the economic fact about Bitcoin and dead stuck for years about a stupid block size limit. Other alt-coin had insanely huge upset, even with the "crash" they outperformed bitcoin this years.
I'm not a dead fan of BU, I'm supporting anything that would increase the block size via hard fork as designed by Satoshi.

@_date: 2017-05-05 01:25:42
Beside the fud related ANY HF, how was classic dangerous? The code was simple, when a threshold in reach, 30 days after the first block would have been 2 MB. 
The problem with SegWit and it's **impossible to get 95% agree on it**. That's true for **everything**, if you work with a group of people for the school project and proposed a great idea, you will not get 95%. This problem alone we are living it right now! Even if all BU would agree on SegWit... the 95% would not get achieved. 
Assuming 95% would agree is by itself a huge flaw that core didn't see, comment and addresses. Even as of today, they are in waiting mode. Bitcoin was designed with the longest chain in mind to solve this issue and soft fork is the opposite.

UASF will leave unpatched miners to their own isolated chain right? As of this writing, about 65% of the miners blocks are not SegWit. This could lead to a unpatched clients following the longest chain on the non-SegWit protocol. Please correct me if my understand is wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:47:59
Litecoin doesn't have the miners diversity as bitcoin have.
As for Transaction malleability, Quadratic hashing can be fixed easily with HF too. SegWit doesn't fix it anyway for current transactions format as both "old" and SegWit transactions are valid... Better fix the problem once and for all, everyone upgrade and move on. This whole concept of carrying old buggy technology is a technological nightmare.

Jihan care, just not with the same vision as you. Those who don't care are those pool that didn't vote for anything. The impossible 95% required for SegWit will not be achieved because of all those pools that didn't vote at all. Stop blaming everyone,  SegWit can't get activated because you can't get 95% of people agree on something...even to choose the local baseball team party location.

They refuse ANY other proposal than an impossible 95% soft fork. For instance, a HF at 2MB with malleability and a quadratic fix would be probably be activated in less than 1 month. Core refuse any compromise and prefer to see the whole thing fall apart.

SegWit is not the solution to everything... first it was a Softfork concept with fixing transaction malleability... then it's a disguise "block increase" that wasn't even mentioned in the original presentation. Now you are telling me that it's code to prevent AsicBoost? SegWit need 95% to activate. it's just impossible so get over it and lets find another solution.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:14:25
I suggest bigger blocks... anything I would be happy. No sure what ASICboost has anything to do with that. Do you really think that everyone who agree that having a network that process more transactions on-chain are paid? Do you really think that having 2MB block would centralised bitcoin? Do you think that having everyone "forced" using LN would NOT increase centralization and reduce privacy and controlled over channels operator? With the current limit we have on first level chain, users won't be able to open dozens of channels every month but limit to a few only.

- Core should have put multiple scaling solutions (because there is!) in place and let the market decide. 
- Core is dead afraid of HF, guess what Bitcoin did HF in the past and all other alt-coin do that all the time.
- Core is against block size increase because we need a market fee, no other alt-coin have a block size limit reached.

The text is clear to me, he was refering to CPU power / hash power / proof of work. Nowhere in the white paper, he refers as nodes because he knew that was subject to sibyl attack. The whole blockchain concept is about proof of work, nothing to do with nodes or users.
Edit: in section 4 Proof of work: 


fastest and outpace any competing chains.
He didn't say, the majority of honest nodes will be the honest chain, but again referring to the majority of the CPU power and nodes follow.

As you said there is plenty of option between status quo and unlimited block controlled by the miners as BU suggest.  I don't think any of the outcomes you propose are really a danger. First having 9 pools to coerse to do something bad would be extremely hard. Most of the miners are very hard to convince, it's actually **those miners who failed to upgrade that are really blocking any progress**. Their lack of voting is making everyone harder job to push for a solution vs another. If miners want to keep block smaller, they can do it right now, there is nothing stopping them do it. The game theory works as intended, do you want the transactions fee or not? 
Removing the 21M is totally absurd, I don't think a single company or miners ever agree on that one, it's the foundation of bitcoin just like the POW.

- The reference client is not the divine choice and yes other implementations can be healthy.
-  a 20k node can process 500k transactions **per seconds**. If you can't process 10 times the current network, you probably can't afford to trade bitcoin anyway and probably don't hold much bitcoin (as the profit you would have made would cover easily a normal computer).


I know bitcoin as a **peer-to-peer**, cheap to transfer currency See original video what Bitcoin was promoted:  Both values not promoted by Core, so maybe it's the other way around to say "as we know it".

SegWit has as safe but impossible 95% activation mechanism. Bitcoin consensus protocol is about the longest chain and it can be achieved with 51%. Satoshi uses that technique to avoid deadlock like we are currently facing.

The funny thing is that most people that argue that BTC can be gone overnight with another alt-coin don't know what a protocol is. And protocol are extremely hard to charge. Example: All the above. IPv6 is **clearly superior** to IPv4 in all way, yet almost 20 years after it's invention most data still get transmit over IPv4. Why ? Because changing a protocol required everyone to change to it and it's not backward possible. 
In the bitcoin world that would be like changing all the web site, exchanges, atm, wallets, hardware wallet, trading software,... and that won't change overnight.
What can change overnight is application, everyone can dump electrum for mycelium or blockchain.info to blockr.io. This doesn't affect the Bitcoin protocol at all.

Just create the software change to roll back and testing would takes days/week and then trying to convince all miners to do that. During that time no transaction would occur... would be a deadblow to BTC.

A crowded restaurant is popular because it offered **something better** than the one just beside. No matter how good, long line up will bounce some people that will accept the other restaurant for a faster meal. Now since Bitcoin is open source, anyone can open it's own "restaurant" just beside and make competition and we see that already.
The real thing Bitcoin have better than the other alt-coin copy with most of them not-so-clean history is that bitcoin is more accepted and more secure because of the sheer number of miners. But that is not something granted for ever... MySpace, Friendster, ICQ... were both media with huge market share and failure to evaluate lead to their death!
Bitcoin **is less useful** because of fees. I can't pay coffee, a song, a game pack or anything less than 10$ because of the fee.  Even non-consumable objects in a project such as data stamping are getting less viable. I'm not sure for how long you follow bitcoin but I do since this [original video]( was released and the most important part of Bitcoin was:
- cheap transfer
- no delay
- permissionless
- limited supply
We are losing the first 2 and you don't care by reading you restaurant analogy!

Exact, we haven't shut down because we got killed, we decide to stop doing business and refund all our customers with gold or Bitcoin as they wish. The gold trading is pretty ridiculous because we would have in a perfect world many redeem center all over the world but the reality you can't accept a gold bar without doing drilling and acid test for purity!... on EACH transaction.

Anyone who actually used bitcoin. I'm pretty sure you are not, Bitcoin was cool because you could buy real stuff in real live and the number of companies and services was increasing all the times. Yet we see a reverse trend now because of high fee, why would you sell something for bitcoin if the fee or eating up more than the other payment method?
Store of value and digital gold is a nice concept but Bitcoin is not the only one in town and soon there will be no reason to use Bitcoin more than another one that will be as much accepted.

- Is limited to ~4 meg

It's SegWit vs BU... maybe if core proposed different options and let the market decide we would have something. What a 2MB HF or HF SegWit-ish was not on the table... this whole FUD against HF is terrible and lead to impossible 95% agreement... that's the failure IMO!

Of course, everyone has to upgrade in an HF. My point is that all non-mining full nodes will completely stop working as they will stay on the dead chain! In a case of a soft fork, those can stay non-SegWit for years... leading to issue that not be able to forward blocks and stuff like that. I personally prefer to force everything to move forward than carried dead weight forever.
I'm not sure what is "blatantly false" in my statement, miners have strong incentive to stay on a valid chain as they earn or not money, full nodes are much more careless.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:59:41
Because they also want the 2MB HF !
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:49:36
It's not safer or less safer, as one chain die it's 100% safe. The danger is if lag around 50% and a multi-confirmation transaction get reversed by a longer chain fork. The other cases is a split like ETH did... that case will only occur if the 2 set of code have different behaviour and some **really** want to stick to one. If it's a good upgrade, nobody will stay in the minority chain
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:40:12
No, a hard fork can be done a much lower level because MINERS will realise they are on the wrong chain and will fix themselves as they won't earn anything! Softfork is about users where they don't realised it...  because everything still continues to work as "normal".
In case of soft fork, users still can use the network even on non the latest version, leading to support old code/old bug/old problem
In case of hard fork, users can't use it anymore, they upgrade and we move with the new upgraded protocol.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:34:10
Are you seriously thinking that Roger and Jihan had anything to do with the fact that 95% of the miner doesn't agree on SegWit? Do you realise that that is far more than 5% of the pool that votes for nothing at all and doesn't offer any scalability solution?
Calling someone to be dead is a serious claim, both of those guys invested much more into bitcoin that you will ever do! You may disagree with their priority but I think you crossed the line here. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:43:37
Mining was super healthy way before having the block full and high fee. Yes they make more money with a higher fee but the bulk of the profit is from the price of bitcoin that increase. That price depends on the network effects and usability both that are getting lost as block as full, long delay, frustration and high transcations fee. Blockstream thinks it's normal to have full block and high fee, now we all pay the price.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:34:20
Following price since sub 5$, it will likely dip but the dip are much lower than the raise... the only major exception was Mt.Got breakdown that, it the time, was the largest exchanges. Today even if Bitstamp, BitFinex, Coinbase or any Chines or Japan exchange it would not shake bitcoin as much as it did. We saw that in the recent month when China stopped exchange to withdraw bitcoin... price dip and then live move on to new highs.

Think broke the entire concept of input/ouput.
Bitcoin do send from and to an address, it send input to output that correspond to an address. You can't just send 1 BTC if you received 2, you send 2 and send the change somewhere. Having a consolidate block saying a address have 2 BTC while in fact have 4 input of 0.5 BTC would just not work to resend them without changing the whole protocol.
I think the only thing we can do is download ONLY the UNSPENT output.

SegWit was presented as clever soft fork solution to fix transaction malleability and quadratic hash problem. In the original presentation the concept of block size increase was not even mentioned at all... later on, SegWit was pushed as a solution for scaling... that was not the original plan.

Each "address" is in fact the public key. In the backup check for the "private key" it will be a string just like the public key but longer... all you need is that key.
With the private key you can spend your bitcoin. I did many test with blockchain.info... just paste a single key add me the balance and the ability to spend it.
Most people prefer wallet backup because you get ALL your public key and ALL your private key at once + some settings such as label but in reality just the private key is fine.

I care little about ASICBoots, even if they disabled or not someone else can probably create something similar. Most miners are unaware of how to enable it so I think the proportion of users who use it seems to be rather small... I think it's a distraction issue than a real issue.
The blockchain size is an issue but far less important than having transactions confirmed with a lower fee. Most people who run full nodes can handle bigger blocks. Moving everything to 2nd layer is even worst for decentralisation as all transactions will be concentrated in even fewer huge hub mostly controlled by companies/banks highly subject to gov spoofing.

I did the survey and I've miss the question 8.
* What is a Bitcoin wallet?
* ~~A ledger~~
* B	Software that records account balances
* C	A place used store Bitcoin
* ~~D An account used for escrow~~
I've called B but the "right" answer was C probably because you're referring to Paper wallet. But why not say at a Wallet is a just your private key then? Most of the people wallet is holding their private key, that give them access to a address and it's calculating their balances.
I think both answers are right and wrong at the same time.
Because to know your own balance you need to calculate the sum of all unspent transactions that you have the private key... that not a Bitcoin wallet job?
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:47:33
The fees is voluntary, if you put 0, there is chance it will never be confirmed... if you put a higher amount the miner will likely pick it first to get the fees...
This particular transaction had no fee at all.
Check the field "Fees:0"
On the latest version of BitcoinQt (the software) there is at least 27 frees transactions per block, so if 1000 people send free transaction, many will have a wait a few block (on average 10 minutes per block).
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:29:35
Big transactions do occured, think about the exchange service moving Bitcoin on and off the network for safety.
The 10 minutes is an estimate between block based on the previous speed of the network. But since the network speed is increasing it's always faster a bit. Once a while the difficulty is re-adjusted to try to be at 10 minutes.

Of course... if you wanna trade for fun, learning and excitement, but just holding will probably make most of your money.

"Deflation leads to depression"... that's not a fact for me...
Deflation is the inverse of inflation so it's the reduction of the money supply and from my best my knowledge there is very few country that don't print money like hell... so real deflation never really occured.
What most people think is that deflation is when price go down, like in Japan. Price going down doesn't necessarily lead to depression... we have electronic price that go down since it's introduction and still people buy it. Having a full currency that have price that go down will be an extraordinary experiment and I believe it will work very well.

The real definition of inflation vs deflation is NOT the price but the supply. A currency that have a 1 billion dollars and print another billion get a 100% inflation. We call it inflation the increase of price for product but it's not. Bitcoin inflation is from the NEW bitcoin created every block, this is VERY predictable and limited.
* Old Definition of inflation
* Webster’s New World Dictionary: College Edition, 1970:
* 1. an inflating or being inflated. 
* 2. an **increase in the amount of money in circulation**, resulting in a relatively sharp and sudden fall in its value and rise in prices
Why it's a deflationary currency then? Because people loose bitcoin, forget their password, hard drive crash with no backup, paper wallet get destroyed in flood... and some bitcoin disappear forever... and that every day!

Lets hope that doesn't implies you can't be an exchange service like BTC China, if it's the case, it will be a huge blow against Bitcoin.

Good luck with you new payment system, Bitcoin is already there for us.

We don't have plan to shut them down anytime soon... it cost almost nothing to keep the site running.

Ok your new to Bitcoin and experience your first "crash". When it's back up to 1000 you will agree it was a dump comment considering Bitcoin has crashed a lots harder than that a lots more times than you think!
Bitcoin has not change, just law and regulation change. The idea is still the same and it's a good idea!

Bitcoin will go encrypted... because right now all communications are in clear text. Same as torrent will survive as an underground currency and will be move to probably illegal or tax haven only. I hope not every countries will do that... Germany and Canada seems to be friendly so far.

No because of the trust. the problem is that when you decentralized you lose the trust. Bitcoin is base on the fact you don't need to trust anyone. Who would hold the gold? The those individuals or corporation would have to be trust.

And? BTC is just a unit, if soo many people use we will trade in mBTC and then you will have 15.5 mBTC per person in China.
More? Why not using nBTC (nano Bitcoin) for 15 500 per person... or Satoshi for 1.5 Millions per person...

Bitcoin is not a corporation at all... it's a protocol/currency.

Our PGP encryption service is surprisingly used a lots so the custom gold chart. Those are the reason we leave the website online... all free! BTW I've even change the code to remove the watermark igolder on custom chart... ex:

Stay away from mining, it's an oversaturated market. I think you will make more money but just purchasing them and selling them later.

Remember to do a double transfer, they would have to do the fake transaction at the FIRST, knowing the next 5 would be there. Then you would have 1 fake transaction and their entire pool business down. Do you really think they will do that? Plus, in the scale and nature of the attack, it would be possible to create a patch to reverse a transaction, on block x, move money from address X to Y. I don't think it's a *real* problem.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:03:48
Nah, the way it's written, presented and discuss it's clear to me it's a lonely guy... no offence to girl but this kind of stuff is mainly supported by buy ideas. Having a girl who like bitcoin is one thing, to think about a protocol soo abstract would defy the physiology.

As normal, there will always be new block, every 10 minutes... forever. The reward is currently 25 BTC + fees. it will go down to 0.00000001 BTC  + fees, after only fees (no reward). People will mine / produce block to get the fees reward.

Peter Schiff is aware of the massive reaction we got as he called Bitcoin a tulip bubble on CNBC. He do read comments and reddit... so he made a show out of Bitcoin.
In summary his arguments: 
* Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (gold have)
* Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimals and is NOT the same gold being divisible because if doesn't have intrinsic value... ?¿
* Other virtual currencies can be launch and create even more. [he is not aware that there is already over a dozen alt-coin]
* Online gold system already exist and it's better.
My counter argument against gold:
* Gold can be fraudulous (ever heard of Tungsten plated with gold?) required to to drilling and do acid test on every transaction?
* Gold is difficult to give to someone else far away... shipping insurance.
* Gold can be seized by force. Bitcoin is harder because you would have to reveal your password.
* Gold can get seized, has been in the past... bitcoin can't without your password.
* Online gold do exist yes but they can get shut down by governments. (e-gold)
At the end one auditor said bitcoin is a public leisure but he dropped the argument to start talking about bubble.

That's some impressive number to put in perspective. Bitcoin will have a great nice market (international transfer, anonymous transfer) but will never destroyed fiat currency or gold. Those who will lose the most are the banks who get insane fees for transferring money overseas.
I feel bitcoin is the libertarian/geek revolution!

The coin are stuck in the special wallet until it's resolved...

Not exactly, you send a payment from Mt.Gox and the input are controlled by Mt.Gox for instance. Same for Blockchain.info where they offer [shared wallet](

Bitcoin DO have escrow built-in... little know but it's there.

[iGolder]( was a currency backed by gold and we shut down because we agree Bitcoin was superior and was affraid of getting shut down by government. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:52:29
Green addresses, it is working? If only MtGox support it it's pretty dump...

A general warning about know what you're doing, you are responsible we don't [can't] guarantee this "money" is best message the government can do to up. We want people to get educated for now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:26:15
yep but right now you will probably make more money just to keep your BTC :)

This video is one of the best because it's start the real idea behind Bitcoin... a public ledger. All the rest is security about how to approve if the transaction is a real of a fake.

Canada has no problem with Bitcoin. Don't need any licenses to buy/sell/trade Bitcoin. Probably the main reason why the first ATM got put there.
Germany seems to be very friendly to Bitcoin too.
The US is kinda "against" because you need a money transmitting license in 47 states and that takes years, cost millions. MtGox got his bank account frozen because he didn't have it... twice!
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:52:29
With todays speed of mining and especially speed increase, I don't a supercomputer like that take more than 10% of the market... and that's a good things... it will reduce the individual % of the big mining pool. Remember we want more player with small percentage. I don't think they will get that much.
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:33:48
MtGox price is the wrong one... because you can't withdraw the money... so compare to [bitstamp]( (2nd biggest exchange) for instance.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:52:15
Did BTC-24 got back all their money frozen? I means I didn't scam the bank froze and probably a lots of a cash in court. Not sure it can be considered a scam.

Never heard of that people pay premium for better coin, all coins are equal in my sense. I can 1 BTC to a merchant or exchange services and received product or cash no matter the history of the coin.
Do you have any facts to support your claim?

thanks, soo much for learning another language :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:24:54
There is nothing to do because to have a setup a good fraud (double spend) they would have to include the double spend in the FIRST block knowing they would have the next 2... that alone is not possible to predict. I don't see a problem with that. Once in a while big pool will get a couple in a row.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:19:11
Your guest is wrong, iGolder never really picked up, we haven't received any letters or even emails from any governments or institutions... 
Think about it, you know about Bitcoin and you're dealing with shipping gold abroad, long delay, regulation, shipping cost, doing drilling and acid test to check for purity on every transaction that involve physical gold!

what the "enforceable time delays" prevent? The stolen bitcoin would still go away but after. The idea of a delay to get some time to prevent something to happen... in the case of bitcoin you can't do that.

Why would it take 7 days to be delivered? Where you purchased them? You talk about physical casascius bitcoin? Then yes, if they are authentic and unspend they will worth their value in bitcoin.
Normally bitcoin delivery is almost instant.

Bitcoin price is not that important when we understand the fundamental of it's concept (decentralized currency, low fees, borderless). We know we would have bumps against governments and we do have [China Ban, US money transmitting license,... ] most of the spikes are either from DDOS or some laws here and there... but the overall graph on a log scale show that Bitcoin is still great technology that is not going to die anytime soon.
