I just picked one of these up. I was stunned by the craftsmanship and I couldn't resist. Talented is an understatement of your abilities. Can't wait to get it.
Thanks Maxfieldo!

I am a proud and happy customer of KnC Miner. They are NOTHING like Butterfly Labs or any other company that has supposedly scammed people. They have not scammed me or my group and have delivered as promised.
I understand people may have been burned by the "Stoopid Jupiters" but KnC more than made up for it by sending everyone more Asic cards to replace the first ones, REGARDLESS IF THEY WERE BROKEN....!
SO if you got a working 3TH Jupiter in the first place, you got 3 more TH's as a "Sorry we screwed up"
To date, no one else has compensated customers for errors or delays but KnC. 
Don't include them in the same batch as other PROVEN scams. I am a testament to their stellar products and services.

I bet you're one of them who bought at $1200 and hating yourself right now. What other reason could there be for all of your doomy, gloomy belly-aching posts? You Mad Bro?

I have not received a confirmation of my order. How do I know my order was received? I Paid in bitcoins direct from your site.

You don't need 30K to buy an ASIC. I have 2 KnC Jupiters. Anyone who has made sound financial choices in the last 2 years can afford one or two. Your assumption that only large corporations are destined to mine is very incorrect. I'm mining coins 24/7 baby and I'm as common as they come :)

No lie, this has been my life since August 2013.

They aren't scammers. That's a fact.

After my 80 UNO became stuck a month ago and support didn't even respond to my petition, I just knew something was up so I dropped them for Cryptsy. I will bet 0.5 BTC that the CoinEx dev's were behind the "hack". Support was non-existent on CoinEx and now I think I see the reason why....

Such sketchiness. Very fraud. Wow.
I would not trust anyone with my money, virtual or fiat, if they had a "virtual address".
MtGox protesters if you can read this get his ass now!!! Take him to an undisclosed location. And "convince" him to give your money back!!

I would just take the other Neptune. Both Neptunes would produce about 2.3 BTC a month. Save your BTC and profit from price increases. Or turn it over into Alts and play the alt market.
Lots of things we can do. You have to look on the bright side.

You know it will :)

I am not selling. I am a miner so I don't buy with fiat. I already retrieved my investment and profited before the "bubble" After looking at  for a day, I decided  Im going to hold. No sense in selling now. China and the US are still buying Bitcoins in massive chunks so obviously the market is being manipulated to allow some to buy back in at a lower price now that the sensation has spread across the land. Mark my words..in a month, the people who sold will be sorry, and the people who bought will be going...TO THE MOOOOOOON!!!!!

It depends on your GH/s. A week after I received my Jupiter (December 1st) I broke even. (at 650 to 700 GH/s.) To this day, I have been operating at 100% profit and haven't looked back.
Maybe this information is some ploy to deter people from getting into mining all together. If I listened to the nay-sayers before buying the Jupiter, Id be one sad little man right now. Fortunately I didn't, and now Im buying new wardrobes and groceries with Bitcoin...
Gotta love the internet!!!

I am also having a blast! Gyft has been my best friend! This Christmas will be very merry indeed!

Cuba could really benefit from Bitcoin. Im sure Raul has his best comrades on it!

So because women aren't interested in Bitcoin somehow it's a mans fault? Women should get out of the kitchen and start learning about cryptocurrency!!!

I used Coinbase.com. Takes 2 business days. Very easy!
