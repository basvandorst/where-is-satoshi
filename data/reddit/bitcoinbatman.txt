Huh, so there is a message there.  Hang on while I investigate this matter...
Edit:  Okay, there appears to be some sort of issue causing CB to be running on variable pricing.  I've notified the dev. team that this is the case, and it should be fixed soon...unfortunately it's 6am in california, it may take them some time before they get my messages...

ACH bank transfers (the system that pulls money from your bank and sends it to CB) take 3-7 days to reach destination.  Allow 1-2 days to reduce the potential of a payment reversal by said system, and voila.

Looks like the issue has been fixed!  If you buy now, you should get the price quoted.

Hi there, please check out the first two paragraphs of this article on high-risk cancellations I wrote for the wiki!

He could also have just left it sitting in his account, and it would have been automatically pulled.

Hah.  I work there :-)

It's 1 per week.

Please note that any bitcoin purchases made (except when on variable pricing like this, I'm sure it's an error that's causing this to be the case though) will be delivered to you at the price that you locked in the order at.  
Once this variable pricing mode is fixed, feel free to make purchases and be assured they will have their prices locked in.

Of course not.  Please keep in mind that the 10 BTC instantly/week limit was implemented back when bitcoin was like, $80 apiece.  $800/week is not an unreasonable amount to assume someone would spend on bitcoin, and many level 2 users did frequently use the full limit per week.  
But now that bitcoin is $800 apiece...most users are still purchasing similar USD amounts per week and very few are even coming close to maxing out on their 10 BTC/week instant limits.  However, every time a level 2 user gets their account compromised (SO many coinbase phishing sites/bitcoin-targeted malware out there now...please be careful and use 2FA folks), CB promptly loses a full 10 Bitcoin as the scammer maxes out their instant limit and runs off with it.  Bad for the customer, bad for Coinbase.  
This change in combination with some new upcoming security options will hopefully drastically reduce this kind of fraud.

I don't think the media or the public really understands what that even means, let alone the significance. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:41:41
Pretty sure it was 10/week before too...but I could be wrong.  I never had a Visa card, so I never used it before, hah.

You get one too &lt;3

It went from 10 to 1...
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:37:35
Well AmericanBrit-man, you can still buy them, but it would appear that Variable-price-man is causing trouble!  
I've called for backup; that villain should be behind bars soon!
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:57:04
I mean...you can write in to customer support and someone will review your account for potential white-listing.  Pretty high success rate of that happening, especially if you have a lot of the optional identity verifications complete / credit card added etc.  
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:05:25
Thank you for providing proper perspective on % change.

Hi, I've looked into this.  I believe it to be an error that's causing the site to run on variable pricing mode, because as far as I can see, CB is nowhere near running out of bitcoin for the day.  
It being 6:20 am in California though, I don't think anyone is awake to deal with the issue yet.  I have notified the correct people that this is the case; I hope it gets fixed soon!
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:09:01
Looks like it's been fixed now!  Sorry about that!
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:41:01
The "If more than $100 is transferred out will require 2FA" is enabled by default.  Everything else must be changed/added yourself.  
@_date: 2014-01-19 06:48:42
I've seen a lot of these cases come through the queue lately.  
I can almost guarantee that your dad inadvertently typed in his information and 2FA code into a phishing website (see coinbase.re for an example, do NOT TYPE ANYTHING INTO THAT FFS).  
Either that or he has malware on his computer/phone.  First possibility is more likely.  
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:48:15
...AFAIK that limitation was removed from the site entirely back in December.  Please post a case number of an open support ticket or PM me your email address you used to create your Coinbase account.  I'd like to verify that as being the case.  
Edit:  Was an error it seems.  Also seems to have been fixed now.  Sorry about that y'all!
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:53:07
Thank you so much for this response.  It makes my day that some people do truly understand how we work.

edit: nice roll :D
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:17:54
Yes, per week.  Sorry for the change; but keep in mind that the 10 BTC limit was instated back when bitcoin was like $50 apiece &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:33:10
Actually, we just completed training a large number of new support staff.  Support ticket responses are back to the normal &lt;24 hour response times finally!  
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:05:15
There's an influx of new hires coming at the beginning of the new year, thanks to that $25 million in VC funding Coinbase just received.  Should get a lot better in a hurry!

If that car disappeared forever, just vanished into the void, if the person you gave it to ever lost their keys, it would be a better comparison.  If that was the case, you'd better bet I'd like to have a spare set of keys somewhere safe.  
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:16:45
Right; I agree.  The OP's intention clearly is to have a backup as a safeguard against potential loss.  You can see elsewhere in the thread that the consensus is that so long as the giftee is aware that if they lose their paper wallet, the bitcoin could be gone forever, but that the gift-giver will keep a backup for them, that this whole process is kosher.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:01:15
...said not realizing the irony of his statement.
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:33:05
Please note:  As a saving wallet, nearly 99% of customer funds are held in cold storage, not online.  This is likely responsible for the slight delays in posting transactions to the network you're seeing as well.  
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:07:16
Phone number too, I think :-)
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:44:37
Umm, even gift cards will have the balances drained away by fees if you don't use them.  With Bitcoin, it would just disappear forever into the void...
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:27:13
I don't see the objection to just having a system in place to prevent the loss in the first place.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:46:24
...Why?  It's a good intentioned safeguard against the bitcoin gifted being lost forever.  If the giftee loses that piece of paper, that bitcoin is gone forever...unless the giver of the gift has a backup of the private key somewhere.
