why do you say gold has a cap?  because there is only what there is on the earth?  If so, I think that's ok for now, but when asteroid mining takes off, that scenario is moot.  That's probably 100 years or less away.  7 years if you believe Wikipedia.  
ps.  there must be _someone_ else who prefers silver to gold, come on.  who's with me?

I fell for this.   hard.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:35:00
Interesting point.  But bitcoin's cap of 21 million contrasts it with gold.  That's a pretty significant property for a currency-like thing.  Also, once people agree what the currency is, that's most of the value.  ie, Bitcoin over Etherium for example.  We just decide which one is valueable (or both) based on 'consumer?' confidence.  Similarly how we prefer gold to silver.  pretty arbitrary.  i actually perfer the look of silver to gold.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:40:09
phew, thanks, can sleep again.  :-)
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:28:44
interesting point.  but i don't thing that's a 'backing'.  it's not like you can trade the gold back for that energy.  that energy is gone to entropy now.  also, if the gold is backed by energy, then so would be the bitcoin.  Also, wouldn't that make anything that's expensive to mine similarly valuable to gold?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:30:44
haha, i love that they only put it up by 1 million, with all that power.  Is bitcoin only protected by sha256?  that worries me.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:10:16
that's true, but he was responding to the accusation of being glib.  i guess he escalated it.  ah, fucking financial guys.  they deserve each other!  :-)
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:32:58
ha, you have an interesting concept here - energy cost is value.  it's not completely crazy.  BUT I worry about that putting the wrong incentive on things for miners.  artificially inflating the energy cost of the operation to inflate the value of their metal 'X' or whatever.  or a new cryptocurrency that takes even more electricity just to be more valuable.
EDIT.  ps.  I think it might be a bit like authors getting paid by the word.  not the most compelling works
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:41:08
yeah, you gotta be able to take punches.  too much pride in his throat
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:12:18
and gold is backed by...
turtles all the way down?
gold's value is mostly arbitrary.  and when someone successfully mines the first asteroid, it's going to be valuable like Tin.  There is no asteroid with another 21 million bitcoins in it.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:27:16
i love me some bitcoin as much as the next guy, but becauses pointing in a circle is trouble.
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:56:09
haha ME TOO!  i'm down $16K!
but I still love bitcoin, bullish!
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:47:13
what about the 90% of fiat that 'exists' that doesn't even have a physical representation and is backed by nothing?  you are making shit up that makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:43:39
yep, buy.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:37:21
you are a total wingnut...   _until_ ...  _the event_ ...  you are the smartest guy around.
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:25:14
you could lose about 99% of it and still have the granularity of the US Dollar today (the penny).
I think it will be replaced before there is a meaningful dent in the living supply.
reading below, I didn't know that it could be made even more granular, so that's a fix too.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:03:54
only one thing still disturbs be about bitcoin.  (not that disturbed, i do own ~3 in trust).  i _think_ we can still print bitcoin by printing internets.  as far as i understand it, if a 2nd internet is created, that is also a new bitcoin system.  another 21M coins.  a new internet is not a crazy idea.  i think China would like to have its own for example.  someone contradict me here, but i think bitcoin is per-internet.
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:23:21
just  vs  does what it does to the market.  suddenly there would be a lot more sells than buys and price would slide.  OR the space miner keeps all his gold and uses it as collateral to borrow money instead.  then it keeps its value.  especially effective if the mining is done in SECRET and no one else knows the volume of available gold on the earth has quietly doubled...

paying taxes would work just like it does now, deducted from your paycheque.  it's no fun to get audited and tax evasion is a crime.  easy and better to play above board.  you can skip paying your taxes now if you want to.  get a job that pays you cash.  you'll never make that much doing it though.  
btw, anonymous is not the same as untraceable.  if you can map a wallet to a person, you can see all the transactions on the blockchain.  a judge could demand you turn over your wallet and/or keys on pain of jail time as well.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:28:55
i don't think you need people to be buying and selling bitcoin itself for it to have a clear value.  eg, the USD price at a given moment does not have a particular value based upon what people are buying it and selling it for with other currencies.  (well it does, but it's a side show).  the value is really what you can buy for it.  it's currency.  
if yesterday people were buying and selling bitcoin and a bitcoin buys a car, then today when they stop trading it for other currency, it probably still buys a car.
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:13:55
this is a good question.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:14:38
agree!  and i don't want to hear about any more lambos!  or hodling!  if you are hodling, you are not using, you are irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:47:12
buy and USE.  it's only going to be valuable if it is a currency
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:45:41
they can also confiscate your bitcoin in a way.  "Give us your bitcoin or rot in jail until you do".  It's basically how any serious court order works.

true, maybe that choice feels really good  :P

any country that makes crypto illegal will just get left behind.  companies will take their innovations elsewhere.

hahaha!  Judge: I'm going to lock you up.  or am I?  yes I am.  Let's see if you can remember if you have bitcoin or not.   i'll check in with you in a month.  i hope bubba doesn't stretch your pooper too much.  :P

Bitcoin is based on blockchain.  But blockchain is based on Chuck Norris, because only Chuck Norris can block chain!
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:22:46
I clarified my question with an edit.  basically, "what the long game for bitcoin?  is it currency or just digital gold?"
I'm asking because I was all rah rah rah on bitcoin as currency and now i'm thinking it's perhaps not capable of becoming that, certainly not in the long term.  I want to know what to advocate for in terms of bitcoin.  It's looking like just digital gold.  which is cool in its own right, just not as cool as a currency.
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:06:33
What's going to happen to the price of gold when this asteroid
is mined?  It's worth 100 Million times as much as the current total value of all gold.  At some point here, people are going to need a new gold for real.  
The term "precious metal" is going to be replaced by "metal".
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:01:19
good insight.  I agree, I actually think that an asteroid mining operation would be driven by a nation state and remain secret for that reason.
@_date: 2019-02-20 04:49:19
Bitcoin is secure because it can only be hacked by a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick.  And Chuck Norris choses not to.
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:08:26
i will watch the video, thanks.  i may have seen it but i'll watch it again.
i do see the deflationary nature of bitcoin playing out though.  HODLing for example.  I have bitcoin, and have no intention of spending it because I see the value going up.  That helps drive the value up.  Problem.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:01:28
hmm if it's an online currency, and deflationary, then won't we have to deal with deflation to the degree that bitcoin is a fraction of total currency?
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:36:47
everything I have read about deflationary economics so far has led me to believe that a deflationary currency (bitcoin) is BAD NEWS and could lead to a pseudo-permanent depression.  ie, it can't work as money.  it think it could work as digital gold, but it might actually be dangerous as money.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:06:04
I don't disagree with anything you have said but it hasn't made me worry about deflation any less.
@_date: 2018-11-02 02:37:36
neat.  but fees too high.  i don't think there's anything wrong with charging a fee if you are supplying a service.  this IS supplying a service.  i go from 1 or 2 shops i can spend bitcoin at to 10000.  that's a pretty big upside.  but the reload fee is WAY too high.  they are already getting interest on the amount you preload with until they compensate retailers for what you purchase which is probably a few months.  so they are probably profiting something like 1.5+% annualized on your money anyway without the preload fee.
I don't think it defeats the primary advantage of bitcoin which is the fact that no one controls it and no one prints it.  I can deal with reasonable fees if i'm getting something for it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:04:26
why would you say that to someone?  this is one of the worst comments I've every read.  I wish I could remove a gold from you.
@_date: 2018-11-02 02:32:52
huh, I was having a hard time really seeing the down side until I saw these fees.  way too high.  a reload fee?  that's ridiculous. they are gaining interest on the preloaded value.  they should be paying you something instead.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:37:12
"10% off if you pay with bitcoin".  World changed.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:41:02
i worry about a lack of inflation with bitcoin because i see inflation as a terrific tax on wealth.  there is no loophole for that tax.  inflation happens, rich guy loses $20, poor guy loses $2.  effort/income is worth more than sitting on investments when inflation is high (presuming that the poor guy gets a raise equal to inflation).
am i wrong?
can we figure out a way to get inflation into bitcoin if inflation is a good idea?  ie, construct another similar currency, "another 21 million coins" that are deemed equivalent to bitcoin and leak out slowly like inflation?   is that dumb?  impossible?
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:48:36
hmm just glanced at their website.  they seem to be a middle man that would make money of transactions, no?  (not that that is illegal or anything, just not necessarily the ideology I am currently shooting for).
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:50:01
:-)  people might notice that prices went up 10% overnight.  also, competitors' prices will be 10% less on average.  
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:10:26
interesting, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:55:51
oh, your first point - i didn't mean only tax on wealth, just that i liked inflation for that - that it rakes in some wealth, and more from the rich.  
another thing i worry about going to no inflation, is that won't it accelerate slightly the wealth discrepancy?  inflation levels it out a bit, how you know, say, 90% of the wealth is controlled by 10% of the people or similar.  without inflation, doesn't that happen even sooner?
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:14:35
so poor you can't skip a paycheck.
so rich your possessions exceed the wildest dreams of someone from 1913.
(doesn't apply to everyone or the MOST poor of course but everyone I know that lives paycheck to paycheck owns a cell phone and most have a car.  2013 was pre-model-T.  1 cell phone has more computing power than the entire world had combined 50 ish years AFTER 2013. )
EDIT: also, i doubt that people from 2013 lived any less paycheck to paycheck than we do.  my Dad's stories indicated that if they got a bottle of coca-cola once a month, they were laughing.
@_date: 2018-11-02 06:07:11
yep they are welcome to try it!
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:45:08
huh that is a very interesting point.
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:45:39
wow really?  what business?  is it working to interest people?
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:44:37
neat.  I checked it out, a little confused by their website though - will look into it more!  and here I thought I had a novel idea.  :P
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:06:02
I love my bitcoin as much as the next guy, but this trope is nonsense.  there are MORE dollars!  it doesn't matter what an individual dollar is worth, it's only HALF the equation.  an average person has WAY MORE buying power with their dollars than in 1913.  people in 1913 were POOR AS DIRT.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:07:09

@_date: 2019-01-10 21:29:57
well people are always saying that the dollar has depreciated over 90% but I have so many more dollars.  the bottom line is, how wealthy is the average person, or the xth percentile person.  everything about a person now is wealthier than in 2013, not even close.  
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:04:32
interesting dichotomy.  i guess they are watching for good news on their cell phone.  maybe this scenario was much worse in 1913.  maybe after a couple weeks people start dying in large numbers.  (speculation)
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:28:08
actually, every pornographic image and movie ever created or that ever will be created is stored somewhere in the digits of pi, as every sequence of data has a non-zero probability.  if fact, every such piece of media exists an infinite number of times in pi.  wow!  i am never using pi again!  i'm switching to 'e'.
EDIT: worse, porn movies of every person on earth exist in pi, even if they were never filmed.  damn.  infinity, you a cruel mistress.

Shiff's flaw: 'gold is rare'.  Asteroid mining is FOR REAL and right around the corner, &lt; 20 years away.  Rockets are going to be coming back to Earth with an unbelievable amount of precious metals, debasing them all.  Bitcoin is truly finite, for the win.  Better gold than gold.

@_date: 2018-07-26 01:07:27
i love debates!  i will debate "tax is theft".  here goes:
money (fiat) does not belong to the holder.  it is not your property, you can't do whatever you want with it.  you can't deface it for example.  it's an instrument in the economy we all share.  it is an common endeavor.  money is the bookkeeping for that common endeavor.    
also, you use the term 'theft' deliberately to make taxation seem bad.  in fact, without taxation, we would be in a sad state indeed.  we would be in an economic ditch with no public services (police, roads, etc...) and only 'theft' could pull us out of that.  
the tax system, imo, should be optimal.  we are nearly optimal in western democracies.  the answer lies among us somewhere in tax strategies.  less than France.  more than the US.
Ps.  most important use of taxation imo: space program.  without that, you don't stop asteroids and one day, one wipes you out.  if your economic system doesn't protect you from that ultimately, then it's not worth a shit!  (it also shouldn't destroy the world along the way, looking at you global warming from human emission of greenhouse gasses)
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:42:16

I actually like this property of fiat money and I wish bitcoin had it.  it's a perfect undodgable tax on wealth.  people think bitcoin is the saviour of the poor.  guess what, in no time at all, the richest 1% will be holding 99% of the bitcoin and you will wish there was inflation from printing bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:06:13

Wow margin trading Bitcoin, can't think of anything riskier.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:54:35
because the lent out bitcoin increases in value over time.  ie, you lend out one, and get one back later.  phew!  i went up in value!  oh wait...  may as well just have kept it.  so...  in the future, there will be NO for-profit loans because negative interest rates don't make sense.  so...  loans will have to be a service, by a public institution, not a for-profit institution.  loans as a service, not as a money-making venture.  OR i am totally on crack.  caveat: i have never taken economics!
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:00:19
thanks for your response.  i am an amateur for sure, trying to understand.  can you answer me this hypothetical:
suppose min wage hikes kept up with inflation EXACTLY.  now if you compared today's system with and without inflation, wouldn't the rich be more powerful more quickly in the world where there is NO inflation?  it seems to me the employed poor would be keeping pace exactly while the rich had a drag on them, a 2% annual drain.  i realized that they make MORE profit above the 2% because of other investments but wouldn't it be even worse without the inflation?
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:11:12
oh damn, you got me good.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:59:20
starting to have a problem with this whole HODL thing.  doesn't Bitcoin need to be used as a currency for it to be more valuable?  therefore isn't HODLing defeating the purpose of HODLing?  ie, you want it to go up in value?
