I don't think buttcoin is what you think it is.

I'm always amazed at how people are willing to sink their savings into bitcoin and yet cannot be bothered to take 15 mins to read something that gives them a dose of reality.

Fancy added bitcoin support in an update, and not when it was reviewed by the App Store. So it's a different scenario.

Cashing out a few hundred thousand won't crash bitcoin. The only way there'd be problems is if a few million gets cashed out every day for weeks on end.

I'm not sure anyone would leave $18000 with this guy after reading that completely unprofessional faq.

I have a feeling that preparation included destroying his private keys, in order to prevent threats on him or his family.

Then fanboys will cry about how Google copied Apple. Meanwhile, rational people will realise that ideas are cheap and copied easily, but implementation is where something will rise or fall. After all, neither the iPod or the iPhone were new, cheap, or had better specs/features than the competition. They succeeded based upon now they were implemented.

It's a shame that someone as smart as him is using their skills for making money from petty small time operations rather than a proper vocation.

They will print more money and get the army to step in, and no one will like that.

Why would buttcoiners need to post stupid stories when actual bitcoiners already do the posting?
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:17:53
If that tweet is to be believed about all the bitcoins being lost, I'm not sure there is a difference. There's no way they can repay their customers now.

Silentshibe speaks! Thank you for keeping the spirit of dogecoin alive in these tough times for both bitcoin and dogecoin. There will always be people who question the values of dogecoin, and cryptocoins in general, and we need to overcome the doubters.
To add on to your response to btcveteran, who seems to be jaded with the community in general:
Yes, cryptocurrencies will change the world in a HUGE way in the future, and in 100 years bitcoin will be fondly remembered as the great granddaddy of them all, but so far it's been what, 4, 5 years? Bitcoin is nowhere near maturity, and the best lessons to be learnt are arguably yet to come. Fiat currency is extremely stable, thanks to its maturity over hundreds of years, whereas with Bitcoin, one exchange's collapse caused wild fluctuations in value. That says to me that Bitcoin has just started its rocky path to acceptance and legitimacy as currency. 
Now, the issue of Dogecoin "not realising the sacrifices that have been made". In my opinion, that is both an overstatement of Bitcoin's role as Dogecoin's mentor, as well as a baseless accusation. If Bitcoin hasn't fully learnt the lessons of business and economics, how can Dogecoin ride off its coattails? Furthermore, Dogecoin is based on a very different economic model to Bitcoin, and quite frankly has its own lessons to learn on its way to maturity.
Yes, it's true that Dogecoin was created after seeing Bitcoin's success, and its codebase is forked from Litecoin, but how do you know that Dogecoin is ungrateful to its fathers in crypto? All your evidence is based on mistaken interpretations e.g. "all they say is "to the moon"", "they just want to sit on their asses getting rich", "the charity acts were all calculated for publicity". I can tell you now that it's easy to interpret these statement negatively, but if you were actually excited for dogecoin's success (rather than merely sitting on a huge pile and speculating as you are now) then it can easily be seen as a sign of a community that is willing to get behind the coin and push for its success. Bitcoin is accepted now in more shops than ever before, but the Dogecoin reddit has also been pushing hard for its acceptance in shops. No cryptocurrency can succeed without publicity, no cryptocurrency can succeed without support, and if I had to choose a news story to spread the word on my coin, it would surely be one on supporting charities, and not one on people losing their shirts off their backs. 
All this is why I'm calling out your statement that "Dogecoin is the greediest altcoin of them all." If you invested in it because it's the greediest altcoin in your opinion, and you are only in it to get rich, then I suggest that you sell them all now and buy a coin that will appreciate in value quicker. I for one believe that Doge will not necessarily rise in market cap to match Bitcoin, but I completely believe in Doge to become a coin that will fill a niche not covered by bitcoin, and hopefully a coin for good.

I meant dollars, so it's only a few hundred bitcoins at best.

They certainly have their priorities down pat.

The US govt will ban bitcoin way before it develops to the point where everyone uses it to evade taxes.

Is there proof either way? Frankeh was merely speculating as to why Madoff got away with it for so long. Whether or not he was in business before deregulation doesn't prove guilt or innocence.

Plot twist: OP is actually Buffett himself.
On a serious note, this does sound very interesting. I would love to play, but not sure if I have enough funds atm. 
OP, ave you tried to reach out to Buffett or his people to get their opinion on this wager?

Why does the government have to reimburse MtGox customers if Karpeles was the one misusing customer funds to run silk road? Besides, the coins are mostly sold already.

Based on the toxic and self righteous writing style, i'm pretty sure it's him. He would never admit it though, as the account has always made fun of anyone calling it a man.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:39:09
Yes. Except for the little fact that Madoff wasn't a scammer for 48 years straight.

Everyone will see their real wages fall, so the employees have no choice but to stay, because they'll be even worse off at another job.


It'll be successful, because no one will have a choice. People won't like it though.

Interesting, can you give us a rundown on this? Are we talking parties, blackjack and hookers, or just wild irresponsible spending? (ala MJ buying monkeys) What are some of the craziest stories?

They said 150% return, not a 150% gain ie you get 1.5x back.

It's been proven that there were ads for assassins on silk Road. Whether or not they were competent at their job is irrelevant.
