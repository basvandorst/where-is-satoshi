Chase is definitely tripping.
I keep all my bitcoin transactions separate from my personal bank accounts. I made a free Simple.com bank account (no fees involved at all), and just use it for when I buy/sell on Coinbase.

Lower the barrier for entry.
To get btc it seems its mainly get a tiny tiny tiny amount, or use an exchange. There should be more ways of getting into it.

Just wanted to comment we are getting into the Game Card/Gift Card scene. Our instantly available codes that we do have instock cost less btc than them.  You can check out whats currently available here:

You could give StuffCoins a try. Its ebay-like but a bit minimal.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:27:58
Coingig seems like a nice replacement. We need multiple marketplaces to prevent big shakeups.
I'm working on one at StuffCoins.com, trying to focus on the idea of users just getting rid of their stuff instead of just listing it up for specific prices.

This is mainly to be used for low-ticket items such as dvds, blurays, clothes you never worn. The majority of the transactions would most likely be for less than $10.
It would cost way too much for someone to ship you a brick instead of a dvd. But seriously it would just come down to dispute resolution and looking at the account history of both parties. Delivery confirmation/tracking is required so we would know if a package was sent/received., some services include the item weight.
The more successful transactions users complete the easier it will get to identify the fraudulent ones. Theres other techniques we'd use but I wont go into too much detail. We'd mainly just be giving most people the benefit of the doubt. If things reoccur we'd block users from the service.
Users are also limited to how many auctions they can create with negative feedback severely lowering the number.

I bought some fractions at low ~500 since I'm about to head to sleep. Cant wait to see the charts in the morning. :)

Hey man, you can get rid of your old dvds/games/stuff and in exchange get bitcoin at 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:13:38
You can check us out, launched not too long ago.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:37:59
Oh man, small glitch occurred when btc started trading above 1,000. Its been fixed and the prices are accurate again.
Thanks for the heads up.

Thanks, I'm going to run through the pages and work on cleaning it up a bit. I may have gotten a bit too excited and rushed it out.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:44:37
Definitely not gone, will fund your account. I see the two different amounts. Will update this in one sec, replicating how it happened!
Edit: Added the 0.003 to your account. Coinbase is tripping. I think you have to type in the exact amount you send on the coinbase form before sending. I'll see if theres a way to prevent this from happening. Sorry about that!
Edit2: Also you're the first user to deposit!

We launched a few weeks ago and are mainly doing digital sales of gift cards/codes. StuffCoins.com is a bitcoin marketplace though where anyone can buy/sell.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:54:34
Signed up! We're going to be stocking our site with game/gift cards and do a % off retail.
You should add some embed codes so merchants can link back to bitcoinblackfriday.com with text or image ads.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:45:07
Awesome, thats the type of feature that would make me use this daily. This would make my life a ton easier!
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:04:32
I would definitely buy one as well! You could probably sell a good bit of these. If you setup a site/store, definitely get an affiliate program up and running.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:48:40
Thanks man. I'm working on all of your suggestions right now.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:07:41
I love simple! I've been using them with Coinbase, and just consider my Simple account my 'Bitcoin account'.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:53:05
This is one of the reasons I love coinbase, that recurring usd buyin. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:30:20
I've been working on one at  its lacking a lot of features but am having fun working on it.
I didn't like how the other marketplace sites always mentioned USD everywhere so I only display prices in btc.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:06:30
We have $10s, $25s, and $50s. Instant'ish delivery!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:33:39
Hey, we have a lot of the same cards available for instant delivery at StuffCoins. They are also cheaper than PCGameSupply.

Next step is to auction off all of your belongings on  and get your wallet growing. +$0.25 verify

I know that feeling. I actually slowly bought silver until I got up to like 60 or so 1oz coins. Then I sold them all at the beginning of the year and just shoved my fiat in my bank.
Should have put it in bitcoin. :(
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:22:09
Nah man, nah.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:51:55
Hey, check us out.  Basically you auction off games/movies/stuff you no longer want with no reserve price. Guarantees you some btc. Only cost to you would be mailing out what you sell unless its something digital.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:14:52
Once the site gets enough transactions handled, I'll open it up to everyone most likely by the end of next month.
I worked for a site before where we sold things internationally and we would always encounter a lot of users supplying the wrong addresses. With some countries we could double check and get it formatted correctly, but with others its just a bit harder. I just want to make sure its working correctly with US -&gt; US, then open it to everyone.
Were you looking to sell mainly physical or mainly digital items?
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:14:13
Hey, I setup a btc only auction site and am looking for people to help test it or at give me some feedback on it.
BTC only auction site with no reserves (or I guess just one minimum starting point 0.001).
This site might also help users who want bitcoins but dont have any extra cash. Everyone has old video games, movies, books, gifted clothes they've never worn, etc. just sitting around. The site wont really be intended for people selling high priced items since there will be no reserves.
So I've coded it up and did a bit of testing. Would love if you check it out. Let me know what you think or even if you want deposit 0.002 and use the site as a bidder. I'll be up for another 6 hours tweaking/testing/fixing whatever gets reported here.
Right now I'll be auctioning off just some $1 Amazon.com codes that will auto-relist after every successful auction. When the site opens up to sellers (within a week), users will be restricted to auctioning off physical goods. Then after users get high rep and through a verification system can start listing digital goods.
The site is located at  (may change the url in the future)
Thanks for reading!
Edit @ 4am: Thanks everyone for the feedback. I tossed up a different design and will be trying to flesh it out more. The layout will probably keep being tweaked as more features are added. Tomorrow going to clean up the individual auction pages. I'll also get more items up. Hope to be able to let everyone host auctions in a few days.
