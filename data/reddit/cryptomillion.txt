“People need to do this, people need to do that. Everything is somebody else’s fault.” Etc etc. If I wanted to be told what to do or how to think, I’d move to the US... or North Korea.

Samourai runs nodes in Iceland. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:35:42
Samourai doesn’t. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:23:45
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:47:14
Server.

[Referencing “default Samourai servers.”](
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:29:47
Doesn’t break SPV. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:05:56
Indeed. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:55:53
Default is less private than SPV. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:36:28
I rest my case. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:18:20
They don’t. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:26:00
Uses DNS seeder to connect to 3 random Bitcoin nodes.

“Samourai is not SPV” - Samourai devs.  
  
Server trusting. Less private.

Their full node.

Oh, no don't be sad! It's ok! The post was a vague reference to the fact that Vitalik orchestrated a re-org of Ethereum after the DAO was hacked, doing the very thing he derided years earlier. Just a bit of fun history revision, that's all.
