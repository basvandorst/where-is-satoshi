A hardfork, with its own set of drawbacks, would at least have been instantaneous and transparent for everyone. As a software developer myself, Segwit clearly was a non-pragmatic and over engineered "solution". Anyway... 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:14:54
That's one of the purpose of Bitcoin Cash: scaling Bitcoin and fixing its flaws without segwit.

There are absolutely **no** reasons right now for satoshi to come back.  He have so much power with his old coin that any of his action will have an huge impact on bitcoin.  The only thing he can do wich make sens is to "delete" his coin.

I think you can add some informations to that.
First, the hacker gave a public access to the bitcoin-security mailing list.  Access rights is now reverted.  Also in [the main page of the bitcoin project on sourceforge]( authors keep changing.  First it was *s_nakamoto*, and then *jgarzik*, and now it's *gavinandresen, jgarzik, sf-editor1, sipa*.  Note that *jgarzik* stand for Jeff Garzik.
[Wired stated the following]( 




Combined with the fact that [Peter Todd only receive emails from 2011]( means that there are a high chance that Satoshi just delete every mails he has on his mailbox just before disappear.  Wich means that Satoshi likely never used this email again and likely the hacker has nothing.
[According to Vice]( or more accurately according to the hacker, Satoshi still try to get back his mail adress.  I let you make your own opinion about it, but I think it's just false.
Also the hacker give to [Adrian Chan two screenshots]( of Satoshi's inbox.
[The first screenshot]( confirm that his mail adress is compromised, since we can see Adrian Chan mail, and Adrian didn't say that is was the wrong title.
[The second]( is a (fake) teaser of a mail wich could contains Satoshi's real name and adress.  Since giving names in this thread is not welcomed, I won't disclose it.  But you can easily get it with some image manipulation programs.  The names and adress resolve to nothing.  Considering the fact that the mail is from 2013 and the website who sent this email didn't check if the mail adress is valid, we can safely conclude that this not about the real Satoshi.
A bit of speculation: gmx.com is clearly a commercial mail provider.  I don't know why Satoshi choose to use this one, maybe to not be flagged as spam.  I'm sure that Satoshi was aware that commercial mail providers is not something we can trust in.  Despite the fact that Snowden leak proved it in 2013, there was already some doubts back in 2008.  So it's pretty obvious that Satoshi take care to never put real informations on it anyway.  I take for account that Satoshi don't trust centralized systems and gouvernements back in 2008, which may be false.
Some more speculation: considere the fact that Satoshi did delete every mails before leaving.  It means that Satoshi really want to disappear and will likely never be active again as he was before.
The only anomaly is the famous


Posted March 2014.  Considering that this message prove nothing, since it's not signed.  Add it the fact that there is no need for Satoshi to claims that, this message is at 99% a fake.  Also, I'm 100% sure that the original message was :

It cannot be him, because [between 2008 and 2010 there is no hole in his activity](
Your list of justifications only compare Mochizuki and Nakamoto personality, but we know very little about Nakamoto personality.  Worse: even if Mochizuki and Nakamoto personality were the same, it does not prove that Mochizuki = Nakamoto.
So no, it is very (very, very, very) unlikely that Shinichi Mochizuki is Satoshi Nakamoto.
By the way:


This is not correct.  What some mathematicians don't like is that Mochizuki do not explain his work in mathematical conference.  Mochizuki papers are in themself very fine.  He still take (a lot) of time to explain his work but only to the interested people. See [On the verification of inter-universal Teichmüller theory: a progress report (as of December 2014)]( for more insight on his way of working.

Companies involved in Bitcoin are not necessarily representative of the whole userbase.  Such companies may even have an opinion that differ from their clients opinion.  For instance by counting active users in and you will find a complete different picture.  In both cases such methods only poll a small part of the whole bitcoin userbase, and that's why the title of OP post is misleading.

As a programmer, I can tell you Bitcoin code quality is nowhere near close to Linux kernel code quality.  While the concept itself is very clever, it's implementation is much more hacky.  It was hacky from the very very beginning (Gavin described Satoshi's code as "brilliant but quircky"), and the codebase never went through a recurrent cleanup process.
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin code is fine, maintening huge C++ codebase is notoriously hard.  But it doesn't stand the comparison with Linux kernel and its developpement process.

This is what I meant.  With practically no fees, every transactions are confirmed within more or less 10 minutes.  On a congested network like the actual core blockchain, some can wait for hours before the first confirmation.


I'm fairly [convinced Bitcoin can scale up to a global worlwide usage](  It's not cheap, but neither are our currents monetary systems.  Nonetheless, even with today technologies, there is a long way before we hit any major bottleneck.


While there is no definitive solution to this issue, there are many ways to mitigate race attacks.  Like monitoring the network looking for double spend, and/or having a good link to trusted nodes, and/or use a second layer of some sort, and so on...
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:11:11
Bitcoin can be so much more than just "digital gold".  It has everything it needs to replace dollar, euro and yuan altogether in the long run.  But actually the main implementation of Bitcoin has hit a scaling ceiling since around May of this year.  There is a Bitcoin-based alternative who argably fixed this issue (0 fees and very fast confirmation time, like in the early days), but sadly it is forbidden to speak about it in this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:50:42


Actually not so much, even though BTC has a lot of inertia since it was the first crypto-coin of its genre.  However some BTC developers work on off-chain transactions technologies as a mean of scaling.  But as of today such technologies are not yet ready. 


Yes, off-chain transactions like LN or sidechains, but it is quite uncertain if it will work, and *when* they will work.  Especially since in the meantime no other scaling solution were (and probably will ever be) approved by Core developers to lower fees and drain the mempool.


Good question.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:39:41
Because that's what Blockstream investors payed for: make all transactions happen on sidechains so that Blockstream can make money out of them.  For that to work, they need to make on-chain transactions so expensive up to a point where the only alternative is to use sidechains.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:40:24


Once again, the "other" chain did not "disabled" segwit: the other chain was created *before* segwit.  In the future the "other" chain could very well support off-chain transactions too.  The roadmap they choose is to scale on-chain **first** and then introduce off-chain transactions when the technology is ready.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:07:48


What is a "fine" transaction fee?  Almost all other altcoins have basically non-existent fees and they have no issue.


Is there any proof that a group of powerful miners *deliberately* tried to fuck Bitcoin?  All I see is miners following their economical incentives: a fundamental behavior necessary for Bitcoin to exist in the first place.


Why bigger blocks isn't Bitcoin?  Satoshi's whitepaper make no mention of the ideal blocksize.  Satoshi himself was in favor of bigger blocks.  It seems reasonable to call both coins "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:54:45
You totally did *not* answered any of the questions.  So, again: according to you, when should we plan a hardfork?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:50:59
To reduce fees to the bare minimum, to speed up transactions, to make sure growth doesn't stop waiting for other scaling solutions to be mature enough.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:53:09
Even a first gen Raspberry Pi can handle 8Mb blocks, so your definition of "small" is wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:07:18


On-chain scaling is definitively *not* the way we are gonna scale to billion of users.  However, in the meantime increasing the block size from 1 up to 2, 4 or even 8 should not affect nodes that much.  Especially with new technologies using advanced Bloom filters, network bandwidth should stay affordable for most node owners.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:03:07
Yeah, Ok, so you have no idea of what you are talking about...
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:32:12


More precisely, the "other" chain did not removed segwit: the chain was created *before* segwit activation.  And secondly, it has an ability to scale via on-chain transactions, because the "other" chain raised the blocksize up to 8Mb.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:11:53


Define "everyone".  But anyway, bandwidth depends on the number of connected nodes, so if you allocates 1Mb/s for `bitcoind`, then it will use 1Mb/s, and still be useful to the network.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:47:40


I guess you are talking about adoption rate of Bitcoin.  High fees means that every small transactions &lt; $10~ are not worth it.  A lot of business are concerned, and therefor a lot of people as well.  Also Newcomers don't want to put thousands into something they started using, just because they can't toy with small amounts.  All in one, another altcoin (or fork) *may* take the lead because of smaller fees and faster transactions.
A congested network is much more unreliable since transaction fees are unpredictable.  As a result confirmation time can get quite crazy, and basically every use case involving more or less instantaneous transactions are impractical.
The thing is, a more competitive altcoin is both a store of value *and* a currency for day to day use.  It is possible to have both properties.  Once widely supported and used, such altcoin will basically make Bitcoin irrelevant since it will be better on almost every point.


It is not as easy as it sounds, because they need a way to upgrade: not every wallet handle SegWit.  To be effective, a significant part of the network needs to use SegWit.  Plus SegWit remains something quite technical, and you can't expect the average Joe to know about it.  On the other hand, increasing blocksize would be transparent and immediate for every users.  Yes, that means hardfork, but other crypto currencies showed that properly planned hardfork are no big deal.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:36:47


You probably know you can only include so much transactions within a single block.  The core issue is not miners mining something else, the core issue is that Bitcoin is now congested for more than 7 months, and no working solution has been applied yet.  Bitcoin Cash have way bigger [hashrate variations]( (i.e. miners going back and forth) and is doing fine without any fees.
Miners have expenses to cover, plus Bitcoin *relies* on miners following their economical incentives to secure the Blockchain.  That's what makes Bitcoin *working* in the first place.  And that's why blaming miners for the lack of a proper scaling solution is irrelevant.

Here we are, so here is your claim:


And here is what the article said:

@_date: 2017-11-20 07:18:13
The greatest quality of a developper is probably pragmatism.  Refusing a simple blocksize increase to 2 or 4 Mb is a lack of pragmatism.  Such small blocksize is never going to be an issue, and will make sure the network could scale in the meantime, waiting for off-chain solution.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying big blocks will scale forever.  What I'm saying is that taking the risk of a congested network waiting for novel technologies (LN or whatever) without any clear release date is a huge risk.  Especially when there are easy and immediate ways to mitigate network congestion. 
Core came up with SegWit, an arguably complex solution to avoid hardfork.  And the big issue is that SegWit require a manual upgrade for *every* users : it is not immediate.  Hence the slow adoption rate, and as a result Bitcoin is still regularly congested.  Perfect is the ennemy of good.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:15:47
When will it be the right time to plan a hardfork according to your feelings?  When fees are something like 1000$ for a simple transaction?  When confirmation time is more than 10 days?  Or when the mempool goes past 10Gb?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:14:46


I'm not claiming to definitively solve the problem.  I'm claiming it will temporarily solve it, waiting for better scaling solutions.


By "the network" we meant full nodes and miners.  Blocksize has a relatively low impact on normal users.  Hopefully nobody host a full node on their Ipad.


Why?  Nodes handle dozens if not hundreds of connexions with less than 10Mb/s.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:39:29


There is no such choice because lightning is not yet ready for deployment.  And *when* it will be ready is a big question.  The entire point of Bitcoin Cash is to scale what can be scaled (i.e. blocksize) to prevent any congestion.  Whereas Bitcoin Core prefers to wait and take the risk of slowing down Bitcoin (Core) growth.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:28:20
No, and Bitcoin is not meant to be a digital gold.  Satoshi was pretty clear about it.  Yes, we should be able to pay a coffee with Bitcoin. And if turns out we can't make it so because Bitcoin reached a fundamental bottleneck at some point, so it shall be.  But in the meantime, 1Mb blocks are nowhere near close to hit any fundamental bottleneck.

My concerns are not about Bitcoin Cash failing, but about Bitcoin as a whole (Bitcoin core + Bitcoin Cash) failing to scale and be overtaken by another coin.

Where did he said that?  Was he looking 1 year ahead?  10 years ahead?  30 years ahead?  Don't you agree that if blocksize is never increased either Bitcoin stop growing and another coin will replace it, or fees/confirmation time/mempool will be so high that almost nobody can run a node to sustain the network (or almost nobody can actually use Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:51:11
Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:33:26
Can you then elaborate why simply raising the blocksize to make transactions cheap and fast does not provide the "security, stability and the preservation of value" you are looking for?

What is a "mutiny"?  Is it when some miners deliberately don't mine Bitcoins?  If so, why is Bitcoin intolerant to hashrate variations in the first place?  Bitcoin Cash suffers from much bigger "mutiny" while still doing fine.  Such "mutiny" are an issue for Bitcoin because Bitcoin is congested since 7 month and is lacking a proper scaling solution.


What wastes everyones time is the scaling debate.  Hashrate variations for whatever reason are not really relevant, because they are an issue only if Bitcoin can't scale.


Bitcoin Cash scales on-chain transactions only because other alternatives like LN or sidechains are not yet ready.  Bitcoin Cash will eventually adopt 2nd layer solution too.  LN will also require sufficient space on-chain to be adopted in a relatively small timeframe.  Thus to make LN or sidechains viable, blocks size will probably be increased anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:54:57
My point is that as long as we can afford bigger blocks, there is no reasons not to do it.  And by "afford" I mean keeping the network secure, decentralized and reliable.  2 or 4 Mb blocks are not going to be an issue for the network.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:30:37
They will increase blocksize only *if* it makes Blockstream sidechains (or LN) unusable because of fees.  They certainly wont increase blocksize to reduce fees for on-chain transactions or to support something sidechains could theoretically provide.
LukeJr even proposed 300Kb blocks, so don't hold your breath.  Time will tell if sidechains can compete against on-chain scaling.  In the meantime, if you want cheap and fast transactions, use BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:09:01


Yes and yes, but I argue that 4Mb or even 8Mb blocks as a pragmatic scaling solution are neither naive nor bad.  Good solution are not there yet, and *when* they will be ready is also a big question.  Perfect is the enemy of good.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:59
Inflation is not a big deal, Bitcoin Core have much bigger problems with fees and a growing mempool...
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:11:03
The point is that Bitcoin Cash is doing fine despite the big hashrate variations, because it is not congested.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:42:40


The point was that the current lack of pragmatism is a threat to Bitcoin.


There are coins with arguably better properties, but they are quite new so adoption does not correlate.  But as soon as they gain enough traction, either Bitcoin scale, or die.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:42:26
This comparison doesn't stand since you took two different timeframe for your average (10 block average is something like 1.7 hours).
If I use the same methodology at this very moment, I get:
    block 481824 	total: 1866 	Segwit: 6
    block 481825 	total: 1966 	Segwit: 1
    block 481826 	total: 1978 	Segwit: 0
    block 481827 	total: 1377 	Segwit: 3
    block 481828 	total: 1 	Segwit: 0
    block 481829 	total: 2020 	Segwit: 0
    block 481830 	total: 1836 	Segwit: 3
    block 481831 	total: 2183 	Segwit: 2
    block 481832 	total: 1876 	Segwit: 1
    block 481833 	total: 2159 	Segwit: 1
Wich averages to an impressive 1.7 segwit transactions per blocks, versus 42 for BCH.  As you can see, OP's claim is rubbish, as well as its methodology.  Plus the number of segwit transactions is actually stagnant as well.  I don't get why OP got so much upvotes for such a shitty post.
