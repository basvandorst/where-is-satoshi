Y'all just getting here will have fun wading through this comment section.  It's insightful and brutal at the same time.  
Bitcoin network is clogged.  It's not a good small transaction system right now.  Maybe it'll never be.  It's the gold standard for cryptos now.  If you're trying to use it to buy a game or pay for a service you're going to have a bad time.  Those companies don't accept gold or silver either.  All the negative people can head out, sell me your coins if you hate them so much, you're not adding anything new to the conversation.

It can be used as both.  I'm sorry I didn't say "those companies don't accept Zimbabwe dollars, gold, silver, or yen either".

The noise in the communities is only static.  There are real players across the globe that don't waste their time on the noise.  They don't worry about the forums or the crowds.  They don't listen when someone spews negativity or positivity for that matter.  They know everything isn't hinged on today or tomorrow.  They know it exists and they know it will continue to exist.  They know the bad actors will eventually be gone and the good actors will eventually be gone and it will live on.  Make your decisions based on yourself and where you are and where you're headed.  Use the information you can and keep your eyes up.  Find what value there is to you personally wherever you can and forget about the rest.  Everyone is a real player in the game but not everyone sees that they play a very big role.  It's peer to peer; ultimately we're responsible for ourselves and our own actions, not Joe Schmo who read an article.  Do your due diligence.  Individuals are smart enough to figure it out on their own, no one needs anything waved in their faces or shoved down their throats.  It's already begun happening.  Those that don't learn for themselves are behind. It's not their fault.  They can catch up and overtake. The future is out there.  
This will be buried and forgotten as a wall of text, perhaps.  I hope it helps however.

"My card died" "did you use it for mining?"
A) not a question I would expect from Radeon

Seventh Continent lets you buy/sell with no fees. True no fees, since it's user to user. Just a thought, for all of you who know Circle will find a way to charge fees.

To date I believe I've spent around 700 hours on 7C, trying to get into the nuts and bolts of it, finding the best way of management, keeping items on the market (they drop back into your inventory after three days), etc.  It's been fun. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:14:46
Say you own a brewery, produce x amount of beer for x amount of cost. There will be bar owners who need x amount of beer for a st Patrick's day party. They'll pay what you need for the beer and add their own little markup, exactly how things work now.  Some businesses are less expensive than others, exactly like real world.  With the MMO aspect there will be items consumed in everyday missions, when people look for raw materials for instance.  I think that's the idea

If I understand his problem and his desire to work in bitcoin full time and his coming from the same background as me I'm simply offering the alternative I found with as much information as I possibly can.  I'm sorry you don't understand by thinking it's "just another exchange" and I'm sorry that it comes across as advertising.
Dear OP, if I am totally off track I am sorry, I didn't realize that u/XxionxX knew everything about everything and I should check myself before I wreck myself because obviously I have no experience or qualifications being here offering up information.

From what I've seen it's a fair balance.  I appreciate your elaboration, you bring up great points, and like I said I don't know even what the new platform looks like, I don't know what other features they're going to add.  They are going to have a free BTC/USD exchange as an extra feature, which will save daytraders cash verses cryptsy etc.  
Like I said, I don't know anything more than what I've observed in the beta. I've got a business background and the economy of it all makes sense. Thank you for the feedback, you bring up great points for everyone to keep in mind.

This is dumb.  It has nothing to do with printing money. It has everything to do with creating money out of thin air, giving a flat 6% to the Fed aka the privately owned central bank, and not having planned for digital banking.  The dollar, and most other standard currencies, are all built wrong. It does keep the 99% working for the 1%, so I guess from that standpoint it was built correctly... Hmmm... I'm happy bitcoin exists.

See you guys here in Spring '15 for the official launch.  I'm going back to my business management there.  Almost a year since I discovered 7C, I'm up a few thousand coins.  Not a big deal I suppose, and why, me, as an average early 30's dude with marketing and business experience who likes video games and bitcoin, should find such happiness in a made up antarctica? who knows.. maybe because I know the digital version of me is free, forever, and has kept my physical world self not only afloat but will take care of everything I ever need, forever.  So, yay for Seventh Continent.  I appreciate all the work that they've done since 2009 to get to here and I appreciate bitcoin itself for making it possible.  Happy to answer anything, since I truly believe this is only the very tip of the antarctic iceberg.

Is it insane to have an imaginary world with a functioning economy?  It's the same as if you monetized Skyrim or Fable or grand theft auto or so on.  It makes sense. Course I've been working on it for six months and have gotten out of it what I've put in.  I appreciate the feedback!
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:16:26
I was too when I first started learning about it. I played around with the free currency they have (marks) to get the hang of it before I switched to bitcoin.  Most of my in game purchases have been towards my business infrastructure for when the 3D world comes out. It's a chance for bitcoin users to have a place to conduct business, and as time goes on real world companies will be able to brand themselves in 7C.  It's pretty much another country, except virtual, but gives the freedom of business from anywhere for anyone. But yeah, get the hang of the game before using real money.  I like it more than clash of clans. :)

@_date: 2014-12-31 07:23:11
I don't know enough about second life to answer as I wish I could, but I'll try.  They built the 7C business sim/economy first, so everything works together as it should, which should mean longevity of the platform. The currency is bitcoin, so there's that.  Seventh Continent doesn't have 3D yet nor do they have prostitutes, which may be a downside for some.  
The extent of my SL knowledge is minimal, thus the answer to your question is unfortunately a 10,000 foot overview.

I will let them know about the FAQ, I'm just a user, I don't work for them.  Thank you for the feedback on it, they'll appreciate it.  
Yes, fake company, real money.  The consumers are other citizens of the continent -- it is its own community essentially.  Say I have a Vehicle factory but in order to produce vehicles I need Lubricants from an Oil Refinery, so I go buy those from another citizen in order to sell Vehicles to a security company and so on.  It's an economy on its own, managed virtually.   
Once the 3D world is released, citizens will be able to do missions using products from the real economy, products from the real economy will be sponsored by outside brands (ie. Red Bull sponsors the energy drinks, mcdonalds sponsors the burgers, hyundai sponsors the sedans, etc)  
It's early on in the lifespan of 7C, even though they've been developing it before bitcoin the bitcoin integration was simple for them to do.  
I hope that helps clear things up a little?
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:49:48
Yes, I know that too, I would if I could.  Remember the part of my story where I mentioned that my friend wants to get paid via PayPal and won't take bitcoin?  There is a simple way to streamline the process and that's what I'm asking for. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 19:15:27
Ah might as well, 
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:57:33
I don't know anything about AML laws. 7C is built in the EU. I've been "playing" for five months, have made back my investment and more.  I don't leave excess bitcoins in my 7C business account so I'm not worried about anything behind the scenes.  There's a 7 bitcoin grand prize for the April trade rally.  They're throwing in a no fee exchange too. 
I don't work for them nor are they paying me, just think it might be a good option for OP to consider as far as bitcoin startups go, doesn't take much time, can work from anywhere, any industry, etc. 
Edit: tl;dr: OP can buy/sell bitcoin no fees on 7C

@_date: 2014-04-21 17:23:31
Yes, it is currently undergoing an inhospitable ice age for another week.  Then it becomes a virtual Antarctica as if the ice age ended. But since there's no actual physical property available on the real seventh continent, aka Antarctica, it has to be done virtually.  
That's how I think about it anyway. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:35:50
Under the company tab there is a P&amp;S Chart button (I added a screenshot to the album) that can give you a rough idea of what materials will cost and what the estimated profit will be.  Otherwise, pick the one you like.!
I try to learn towards industries that can be sponsored easily too, so when real brands put their names on the in game products, I can get paid a cut of their advertising fees every time I sell one along with whatever other profit I had working in it.  
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:17:57
It's the first standalone bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:17:51
Let them think that. I'm content with the value bitcoin brings me, myself, and I.  I love having 100% control of my money without worrying about a third party.  I love not being exposed to bank runs, faulty credit card terminals, account locks for traveling to another state or country, fees for no reason, dealing with ATMs, so on and so on. 
The ones who say it's a ponzi or pyramid are HOPING that it is, so that they can say "I told you so!" instead of the slightly more realistic "I wish I would have invested earlier".
Why, because yes, early adopters did good, they made out like the gold rush pioneers did, but the main difference is that if this community did not grow by one new member, ever, bitcoin would still continue to grow, because the ones that truly understand bitcoin and the financial system we have now will continue cashing out of traditional currencies.
The shift hasn't happened yet, and it may not be complete for awhile, and bitcoin may not always be THE crypto, but the algorithm is sound, the mining network is built, and with inflation and bankers greed killing fiat currencies globally the smart decision is to control your own funds and not worry about the 10-50% fluctuations. Those will balance as time and bitcoin education continues.  
But just my two cents. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:27:06
Explain that breakdown please since I'm in the US? And also, that tl;dr is unnecessary and wrong. I don't care what BTC is worth. I'm looking from a psychological perspective of the easiest way to explain to the general public the value of a bitcoin.  I am sad there are so many nearsighted people out there. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 02:40:24
I had to play it for 6 months before I felt comfortable posting about it here.  I'll try to summarize.
You start a business, trading in either Bitcoin or Marks (which is the free currency).  Name the business, choose the industry type deal.  Once your business is running you need a property to operate out of.  There are condos, houses, warehouses, and compounds, all with their own address on Seventh Continent, so depending on how much space you need you either rent or buy property.  Once that is done, you get on the Market to purchase goods that your business needs for production.  You produce the goods of your choice, as time goes on your businesses can level up (produce more for the same resource cost) which means more goods to sell on the market and larger profit margins.  If you choose to trade in bitcoin and don't have it available to you, there is a citizen to citizen exchange along with the market so you can trade peer to peer on seventh continent for free.   The only fees they charge are for goods sold on the market and it's .1% i believe.  I'm not affiliated with them at the corporate level, just am a random citizen who started playing in the beta-beta back in december, just kinda love the game and want more people to understand it.   
Plus, a completely independent virtual antarctica that operates on bitcoin creates the possibility that as long as there is internet access people can "live" and "work" in antarctica.  It's kinda sweet.
edit; word, nothing i can do about clarity \o/

@_date: 2014-08-15 13:33:19
I guess I'm having a hard time understanding how them sending funds to PayPal instead of sending them to my bank is any different. My bank is a third party too, and honestly I trust PayPal more. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:39:02
I get that too, whenever I think/start to worry about price I just remember the immense cost that has gone into infrastructure for the network itself and also that most of the coins have been mined and not bought.  The price could hit $1000 again overnight or it could go to essentially zero.  Bitcoin is a safety net for failing currencies among other things so as time goes on the natural progression of it adds value even if it's not reflected immediately in the price. I hope that makes sense or helps calm the nerves a little.
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:06:22
I never played second life, but yes it's focused on using actual bitcoin to buy materials and produce products that other people need as their materials, and so on.  I hope that covers your question? 
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:10:12
I think you're right.  They have gone away from the "Game on the 7th Continent" idea and more towards it being a commodity exchange.  It plays like a game, if you like business management enough :)

Right, I'm not trying to explain to bitcoin how bitcoin works. I'm trying to explain the best way for the general public to be able to understand. And what doesn't understand is that the scope of this whole thing is much bigger than this whole "price set by market" thing..  no one knows what the price should be. It's dumb that the market is the guide, the market doesn't know. 
Thank you for the metric breakdown. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 07:59:06
The hopes of children the world over rest on our shoulders!  I feel like my understanding of it is good, when it comes to the nuts and bolts, but terrible when it comes to trying to explain it.  Maybe "similar to Second Life set in Antarctica with a bitcoin economy" comes close.. but I don't know enough about second life to compare them. The struggle is real.!

@_date: 2014-08-15 13:27:56
That was my thought as well, but I was thinking about it a little more and PayPal shouldn't care where the funds come from, and Coinbase can just treat it as a usual bank deposit, just sending it to my email instead of the bank. 
Ie. 
I sell coins on Coinbase. Coinbase sends those funds to my PayPal email address instead of my bank account. I can't commit fraud, since its my money from sale of coin. PayPal account is funded via goods/services transfer from Coinbase. They get their fees, so they'll be happy, and it never has to be about Bitcoin for them.  There isn't a place to commit fraud in the process.

They wouldn't have to agree per se, Coinbase can just have their own PayPal business account that they send funds from.
Eh, it's an idea. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:48:31
I hope it proves to not be bullshit.  I know how much they had to go through to even get listed on havelock so they at least have a business model that works.  I apologize if you feel that way.  I'm still objective too, I haven't seen the final product, I just know that the beta made sense and I made actual profit.  If I hadn't, I wouldn't be posting here wasting your time, I don't work for them, just sharing due diligence

Here's a gallery with a login screenshot and the three from the prospectus.  
Seventh Continent is a centralized company; the world they built is designed to be open.  Citizen to Citizen trade in fiat/bitcoin and back is on there too.  It has everything a economy should have except for a fed.  
edit, ps, i keep adding screenshots because I feel like no one is just going to sign up for something random without more information, and it's actually kinda fun
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:08:06
Agreed, the plan is to go above and beyond with this AMA :)  Here's a screenshot that gives a rough idea of the Market platform:
 
When you're looking at it, you see at the top "Market"  "Company"  "Banking"  and "Logs"... pretty much the main portions of the system.
It's a company management simulator.  
Where "Private Party" is, that's a dropdown that has every single commodity, there's a couple hundred of them.  "Amphitheater" is the name of my Bar.  Under "Sell Products" I would select Private Party and set the pricing competitively.  Other businesses that need Private Party to produce their goods would look on the market, pick up one or two, and then put their companies to work.  
Here's a screenshot of the Company tab:
 
I think I made that all more verbose than needed.
Each item has an associated price with it, you buy items from the market, use them to produce goods from your business, then sell those goods on the market for a profit.  
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:13:02
.... Last October is 6 months ago.  That's not super long term and definitely not SUPER long term.  
Bitcoin isn't here to make you money, it's not a job, it's not an income. 
If you were a normal "long term" investor you wouldn't care what it did daily or monthly.  Look at the year over year performance.

They have a partnership with instacoins.eu, so that you can send funds directly to 7C.  They also have a citizen to citizen exchange set up so people can buy/sell/trade between themselves peer-to-peer.  They are HQ'd in the UK.  
Great questions, thanks for checking it out.  It's more than a game, and quite the project for sure.  Could be the next generation of economy for a lot of people.  
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:05:03
I don't know how it compares to a ponzi.  Raw materials are priced based on equivalent value, say it costs you 25 to produce product worth 35, you sell that product to other people who need it for their own business. All it is is a virtual continent, the entire economy is built based on how economies work now. There are breweries, oil and gas companies, vehicle manufacturers, etc.  The eventual plan is for raw materials to be harvested and brought to market in the game. So people with no capital can earn enough to start their own business.
I'm sure I went in a tangent there. Apologies if it didn't make sense

Yeah, sorry about that, it's hard to describe something that has never been done before... it basically is an MMO, with a functioning bitcoin economy built in..  Thanks again for checking it out.  There is a trade rally starting on May 17th, runs for 77 hours, first place wins 7 bitcoins, I'm looking forward to it.
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:03:32
Good question.  
So, there are somewhere around forty different businesses.  Each needs certain materials to produce their products.  The materials they get either from other businesses or raw materials such as gold, silver, wood, crops, and so on.  So it comes down to are you buying for the right price and are you producing the items that are right for the market.  
It's eventually going to be a full 3D MMO with a fully functional free bitcoin economy.  
Did I miss anything?  Thanks for the questions 
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:01:37
If I understand what you're getting at it seems it's misunderstood 
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:23:28
Breweries, Insurance Agencies, Vehicle Factories, Gas Companies, etc.  
They all produce goods that the other companies use.  Each company uses 6 different goods to produce 5 different products; the amount of goods needed depends on the product, and the resulting price of the product depends on the amount of goods needed to produce it.  
It's similar to any other real world economy.
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:45:24
Yeah, almost a year worth of work 
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:51:21
Appreciate the comment, and yeah I had to read the prospectus to get the full picture.  Plan is to have a 3D world built (80% done), MMO style to go with the 2D platform (that is live now). 
They have the capital to get it done, courtesy their IPO on Havelock landing enough BTC so they don't have to worry too much about pulling a profit at launch. 
They charge 0.7% on market transactions, so their goal is to get as much of a userbase as possible (which is why they're doing the commission free user to user BTC/USD exchange) 
The long term goal with the 3D world and so on is to have real world businesses represented.  It's a virtual Antarctica, functioning economy, with real world products and businesses.  That is where Seventh Continent as a company will start making money, they'll split the marketing revenues 50/50 with the users.  Say the Energy Drink that I produce and sell in the game is sponsored by Red Bull, I get paid half of the sponsorship proceeds and 7C gets half.  
The referral program is nothing extravagant, I didn't spam my referral link here and don't see the need to, in the big picture it doesn't matter. 
Summary of sorts-&gt;
Virtual Antarctica, 2D economy now + 3D world in 2015, 0.7% fee(tax?) on market transactions, no commission BTC/USD exchange, free cash in/cash out, in game sponsorships of anything from energy drinks to vehicles, all produced by businesses owned by the users aka citizens. 
I hope that makes sense, it's hard to describe other than "fake but real though" and that doesn't help either. Thank you for prompting the write-up, it helped clear it up in my head too.
Also, it's free to try out, there is a play money economy built in, that's what I started with when I was figuring the game out.  If you register, go to your profile, there is a Marks or BTC option along with 2FA etc.  
e: 0.7%
@_date: 2014-10-31 19:09:50
Thank you, it's been quite the road. Their website is 7cbit.com. It's coded in html5 so mobile friendly. It's still in beta, springtime should have the 3D world release.  If you have questions once you start learning it I should be able to answer them. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:38:10
Well, that comment was interesting.. let's see here..  
I have a live wallet on my phone. I have the rest in paper wallets which is what I mean by 100% control of my money.  Yes, anyone who leaves their coins under the supervision of anyone else should be aware that bad things can happen.  Would you let a random hold on to gold for you?
Dealing with ATMs simply means I don't like paying fees to have access to my money.
I recommend you look up what a bank run is, I do not think it means what you think it means. 
If by kool aid you mean the choice I've made to utilize bitcoin in making my day to day life easier and BS free then thanks, I'll have another.  If it crashes, so what, I haven't invested more than I can afford to lose.  Life goes on.

@_date: 2014-03-21 03:26:13
That is the most comprehensive comment response I have ever read and I am honored.  All of your points are completely valid.  My initial response wasn't complete enough, but definitely didn't put much thought into it either.  
Like I said, I know nothing of AML laws.  I simply assumed OP wanted to be 100% in the bitcoin business.  Seventh Continent is its own economy.  The bitcoin exchange piece is simply an extra feature they're building into it. 
I have a brewery there, etc. 
I didn't expect to go on all of these tangents today.  I apologize for incomplete or question avoiding answers. 
I'm probably going to read your comment again, and will probably see more good points that I missed.
Seventh Continent is essentially a virtual Antarctica, so OP could do business there, treat everything transferred into 7C as an investment including buying and selling however many bitcoins, pay taxes on the gains here in the US and be good to go. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:21:05
Check out seventh continent. It's on havelock investments. I work "full" time there. New platform comes out in April. Will have a free exchange. Don't know what business you're in or what you plan on doing or if this is even relevant for you but hopefully it is. Good luck. !

I feel like this post got launched.... Going through the comments it seems strange that there would be a 87% approved when it feels more like 50/50.. but hey, this is where the only consistency is inconsistency. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:22:58
No one is too poor for bitcoin.  One bitcoin is 1,000,000 bits, and each bit is 100 satoshi... So you could conceivably pick up a few million satoshis for not much money.  Then, years from now you can tell the story of how you started collecting. I have very little real world spending money, so have shifted priorities to accumulating whatever btc I can and keeping the target years out.

If I hit send, and it instantly shows up in the other wallet, confirmation time doesn't matter.  For bigger transactions, if I can't wait for it to confirm I probably shouldn't be spending it anyway. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:46:35
Are you just looking for something to argue about on this fine day?  $2 worth of bitcoin is now $6000 worth of bitcoin.  That took very little time.  Granted, tomorrow that $6000 worth of bitcoin could be worth $2 again.  Would you spend $2 on a coffee if someone explained everything about that coffee in the process? OP will, with that $2, learn how to scan a QR code, set up a wallet, send, receive, and so on... Isn't $2 worth it to feel comfortable talking about and using an emerging technology?

Bitcoin isn't an investment to me. Bitcoin is my banking system cause fuck the banks. Every time I have cash, I pay bills and convert the rest to bitcoin.

I was wondering where your negativity comes from but it looks like it's just the type of person you are. I would argue that 72% does technically represent a majority, regardless of how loud the 28% are. You will rarely/never have full consensus in a peer to peer community, bitcoin or not.  It's good that things are moving forward. Also I think it's funny that you recognize his username and refer to him by his first name in quite a few posts. Does it legitimize yourself in your mind?.

Was going to post a new comment about it but following your guys' thread.  Bits and Satoshis, dollars and cents, you have a million bits in one coin, 100 Satoshis in a bit.  That's it.  It's done.  No mBTC no kbit nothing beyond a million bits per coin and a hundred Satoshis per bit.  It's always been how it has to be. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:45:43
A million bits per coin and 100 Satoshis per bit.  That's the most logical choice.  Dollars and cents related to a full coin in one sentence.

I bought gas this morning at Costco with my shift card. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:47:43
Yeah, it's the default in my mind of course because of where I grew up.  You can substitute out any currency though for the sake of explanation since that's all it is.  Euros and cents, Yuan and fen, yen is just yen, so 100 Satoshis in a yen.  And so on 
Edit for downvotes: Y U No Understand?. Hahah

@_date: 2017-01-01 21:59:29
We need to start pricing in bits.  Once we hit a 1 bit/$1 parity many will be happy.  Satoshis become cents. It's the easiest way.

I respect your disagreement, it may just be a complete guess, we'll find out.  But, regardless, I'll still have control of 100% of my coins and have it be completely up to me what happens with them.

@_date: 2015-07-12 19:24:33
Actually, there are one million bits in one bitcoin, so one million dollars per would equal one dollar per bit. If you wanted satoshi/dollar parity a single bitcoin would have to be worth $100million.

The job itself is great, I'm a carpenter making decent money hourly, I build stuff 40 hours a week.

@_date: 2015-07-12 22:14:47
This is a good answer.  I would assume that satoshi wouldn't immediately sell every coin although who knows. Bitcoin is like a little toddler that doesn't know yet how important it is. Maybe satoshi knows and that's why it's the hold mentality. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:21:01
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:57:42
In my mind it's always been a million Bits per coin, and 100 Sats per bit.  
Decimal can stay where it is for legacy wallet purposes.  Just know 0.000001 is actually one Bit.. and each Bit is 100 Satoshis.  Dollars/cents or whatever other currency comparison you'd like to use. 
Eventually it'll go to straight Satoshis but in terms of one coin, it may be better to have a million bits and fractioned out bits, verses 100 million Satoshis per coin.  
Just my two Sats. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:43:00
It's a business decision at that point.  I think the CEO knows more about bitcoin than you give him credit for. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:04:51
Yeah, for sure. Unless he had enough holdings to cover the loss in retail revenue. Say 10 million is given away in product and bitcoin value jumps, which it obviously might due to the publicity of the standardization and the value of one bitcoin very roughly pegged at $1 mil per.. When it comes time to sell their coins from the sale they can set it at $1m each and eventually that'll be the standard. It's the easiest way to mainstream.

Yep, nailed it.  There are some things happening with the dollar and the decentralized mining networks are strong that no matter who the alternative crypo is they have a solid wall to climb. 
The bitcoin network is built, solid, and already there.  It would be easier for a country to adopt it as a currency and back it than anything else.  The country would then get immensely wealthy as being an early adopter and would simply convert currency over, tax the capital gains on the way, and boom you're taking your country to the moon.  Pretty simple, really.

No throwaway. I've given away/spent about 27 bitcoins since January of this year. In the past couple nights I gave .01 each to five buddies of mine to give them a head start ("Download the blockchain app, I'll send you a bit").

Use this [mining profitability calculator](
put the difficulty at least 10 times what it is now (just a completely wild guess)... and then punch in the rest of your numbers.  
I have to believe that the potential of bitcoin crashing is about 95% "no" but i'm not going to say it's not going to happen.
if you were one of the first to preorder the 600ghs rig then you're probably good.  regardless, you might be fine.  I just know about my personal experience with BFL, miners, and preordering, it would've been much better to just buy the BTC and hang on for the ride.  Although it is nice having something churning away making cash even though it's only a few dollars a day.

Got it downloaded, was looking for a promo code through all your old posts but no luck.  Looking forward to checking it out more, only 6 people online right now so staying on seals at the moment.  Looks promising!!

Don't use Gox, not because they don't work, but, just because.
Trade small amounts if you absolutely feel you have to.  BTC-e is straightforward.  Sit on it. 
If you're looking long term, I would buy at any price.
My response is mostly because I'm bored at this exact moment.  Do what you need to do.  Bitcoin is interesting.

yeah, by the eighth time they just have you type in your first name
.... unable to avoid that
it seemed like i knew the answers the second time around is all.  it might be more difficult, who knows.  good luck!

Lots of people had autosell set for $900.
The market is going crazy because knowledge of bitcoin is spreading.  
The early adopters are cashing some out to buy things they've wanted for years.  The recent adopters are buying to save or buying because they understand the eventual value.
BTC will, long term, not go down.  It's designed against inflation and as such will naturally grow in value.  
There will be spikes.  SO MANY SPIKES.  
When I started typing this it was 700, then down to 680, now up to 720.  
It's worth what people will pay.  If it was the only currency, and the only amount someone would sell an entire bitcoin for was $100,000 or a million or more, then that's what would happen.  
It's crazy to watch.

You're right, it could've gone well, which was why I went the miner option. The thing churns out .003 btc a day, so if the value ever catches up to mining difficulty it might be doing good work already. 
I did quite a bit of research. All the indicators from the company showed that they would be starting production in May/June and ramping up production to get all units shipped by August. According to the spreadsheet I built they didn't gain anything on the backlog for the entire time they were producing miners, which also went against what they told everyone. I paid around $400 which included "expedited shipping" which was also a huge ripoff at $100. So now I have a 5ghs paperweight when if it would have been shipped when expected it would've at least broke even by now. As is I'll probably never get the money out that I put in. I'm waiting for a class action lawsuit against butterfly labs, and if one doesn't show itself in the next month or so I'll put it together myself. 
If you're looking at mining equipment make sure it's as up to speed as possible and make sure it's going to ship when you expect it to. I factored in difficulty calculations that would have been accurate if the miner shipped when indicated, but, alas, that was a failure.

I signed up for Cryptsy, haven't used it but it looks solid.  I think they're making progress and are getting better at handling volume, definitely worth checking out.  
Good luck with all!

Throw me in the brainstorm/script mix.  Sounds fun.  Youtube might be the quickest / easiest way to reach the most people in the right demographic.

Same here, no idea what it is

Mostly because the American mindset is "it's going to crash" and the Europe/China mindset is the logical "it will only go up"
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:56:29
Yeah, whatever price you sell at will be what you get, settles instantly.  The only delay is the transaction time between coinbase and your bank.  
Side note, I transferred some to BTC-E just so I could pick up a few namecoins, since they're mined in conjunction with bitcoin and have a completely different purpose I think the value will go up over time.  Might be worth throwing a bit at them. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 01:31:09
So this would be [your old address]( then?... you sent a bunch of coins to it, small amounts, from all over the place, and one 10 BTC transaction, and then took them all and sent them randomly to 1G4Y?
.. hmm
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:59:37
I bought a BFL miner in april... it was delivered a week ago... and it was a huge waste compared to buying bitcoin and holding on.  
the 600gh/s would be sweet; except the market is going to be heavy.  it's going to be better to invest that cash into full bitcoins now than wait for a miner to show up. 
then, preorder the next one as soon as it's possible.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:58:12
Right on, thanks, and nice work so far
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:35:22
I don't know enough about mtgox, so I'm not sure if they use blockchain, they probably do just because of the simplicity.  (mtgox = "magic the gathering online exchange").  I think the majority of people use BTC-E for trading so you'll find the market there is pretty much people reacting to news/charts/etc and trying to guess right and make a few bucks.  I wouldn't use BTC-E as a solid platform.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:23:22
I use coinbase instant buy, which is nice.  The debit hits my account a few business days later.  With a personal account my sells take about 3-4 business days to depost.  
If you're using BTC-E to buy/sell, the trades happen essentially immediately if there are buy/sell bids at your price.  It's kind of fun.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:42:03
All it'll take is one saudi prince to say "oh buy me a thousand bitcoins" and another say "oh, buy me ten thousand bitcoins"
maybe within the year (12m+ bitcoins x 100k = 1.2T+; currently 8b+ in circulation, would have to grow 17500%; grew 400% in one month, things have a tendency to go viral, say 800% month two 1600% month three 3200% month four 6400% month five 12800% month six and boom six months to a year from now it's possible.  
Likely, meh, maybe, possible, yes.

Do you realize that eventually bitcoins are going to be worth thousands upon thousands and that your bubble concept is good but it's not going to matter in the long run?
I agree, people and businesses need to transact in bitcoin.  People like Gyft have the right idea; bitcoin ATM in vancouver is good too.  It's only just begun. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:52:13
assuming exactly 12 million coins (more generated hourly, cap out at 21m in 2040ish); yeah, that's correct

I'd wait another ten years or so until bitcoin is fully realized and THEN show up.  Be like "oh hey, I saved the world from bankers, no big deal" and then donate everything (except for that one wallet with 50btc or so) and live like a king.

Peercoin isn't reverse engineered against inflation. That's probably why.

Just looking at that makes me wants more BTC right now.  I don't care what the price is, look how many people are just now finding out!? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:08:41
I'm right there with you.  I had a bunch, got rid of essentially all of them, now all I have is what my little 5ghs miner is making.  it sucks. 
nice thing about it though, no matter what you buy/have now, it will go up in value. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:22:03
I agree that it is better; the only thing is right now you can probably buy more BTC now with the funds you have than your miner would be able to generate long term.  The only problem then is the sustainability of the bitcoins you have now.  
BUT, i'm in the 'have very little btc/cash now waiting for my piddly miner to create some in hopes someday i break even' situation, so take what I say as a wet blanket.  I would love to have a 600ghs miner and if you have the ability to get one I'd say go for it.

I wasn't watching the charts that close.  I can only assume since the drop happened pennies over $900 that that's where people had decided to sell. Good info.!

On your main list, link to the wiki or homepage of the coin if you can.  I'm curious what copperlark is but I'm too lazy to google it.

There is a finite supply of a globally recognized decentralized currency that takes the money supply out of the banks hands and lets people handle everything themselves.  It'll rebound.  There'll be fluctuations along the way, for sure, as people gain wealth and sell and as people gain knowledge and buy. 
It is what it is.  It's going to be an interesting week for sure.

I searched his twitter feed for a little while.  He tweeted about the first bitcoin ATM going live in Vancouver back in October but that's about it. 
Still haven't heard it mentioned in his podcast but I'm a little behind.
