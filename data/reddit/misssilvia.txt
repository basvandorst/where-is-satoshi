Well we were introduced to it by a visiting client from China about a year ago. At first, I thought it was a joke but found it intriguing and extremely useful after first use. We have introduced this to many of our clients &amp; girls since. Spending it directly is a bit of hassle - not many shops accept it but works great for moving value.

Fixed :)

Exactly. I find that its more common with old money. Live a lavish lifestyle but be smart with money management. But then again when they do ask for a price it is usually because they intend to ask for multiple partners.

Sure will do.. :)

There are nearly 300k millionaires in London. And billions spent in the luxury sector by visiting foreigners. The demand for [elite escorts]( outweighs supply.

I am sure she has a agent. But that could be a bill of over a 100k just to hang out. Most fashion models who become famous have been a travel girl at some point of their career. I know this because I have seen it..

It's not always the case, a lot of well of clients who can afford do ask because they like value for their money.

Very interesting! We are starting a paid membership service soon. Maybe you can direct us on how to implement this on our website?
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:31:32
Well yes those usually range from around 20-30BTC...
....Per Hour!

I am not a trader or a gambler. So the daily fluctuation doesn't effect me as such. I know things have been stable now so its a lot less intimidating for new comers, which also helps when we introduce it to other associates. However I do consider myself as a bit of a entrepreneur so I keep some bitcoins stored away (not so much with the hope of price going up but rather of the believe the technology will have a bigger part to play in the future). Because of the world's current financial outlook and the flawed monetary system we live in, there is a possibility that cash might become worthless and the only thing left to trade with will be either physical or digital gold. Lets hope that doesn't happen and we move towards prosperity.

Convert 40% to cash. Keep 10% in savings and use the rest to make payments to our [travel girls]( who live in different European cities.
Edit: We have had to teach the models, how to use and exchange to their local currency.

I usually don't feed trolls but since you made an absurd accusation I would suggest you read our [policy]( We never ask for any advance, thats just not how it works. Any sort of transaction will always happen between the model and the client once they meet. 
Client deals directly with the model on the day.We are simply a introduction service.
And the stock photos you are referring to are for the main background and [blogs](    All the models you see in [gallery]( now are available in London and [Travel girls]( for anywhere in Europe.
My suspicion tells me that you're a couch pundit and will probably come back with another absurd comment.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:08:04
Upvoted! you are right, the latter.
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:58:15
I am confused..Whats DNM? Is it something like BDSM or CIM?
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:05:58
Intriguing! you learn something new everyday. Stay off the illegals my friend!
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:29:06
Haha, wow! With all those coins I hope they have managed to brush up since.
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:38:30
Lol not sure who these guys are but I get the pun!
@_date: 2015-10-15 23:42:12
Its in sterling (GBP), works out to be around 5.92BTC per hour.

Just received "reddit gold for a month" not sure what that is but seems like harmless fun. Thanks who ever that was.
@_date: 2015-10-16 08:28:25
Ha You guys are good with wordplay. Its back online!
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:22:22
Well I use to when I was a "travel girl" but haven't since I took on the entrepreneurial challenge of becoming the middle man instead. The world is full of characters so I have been lucky enough to only meet good people. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:29:54
Thanks :)
