Nah, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it is irreversible. Sorry man.

Been there, done that. At least in my experience, VirWoX doesn't accept prepaid Visas or unverified PayPal.

Well, then I guess you shouldn't store anything on the outside that you wouldn't write on the outside of your hand, and anything on the inside that you wouldn't write on the inside of your hand.

Alright, thanks. I've bought from there before, just haven't done instant.

I live in Chattanooga, TN. There has recently been a tech boom here, but there is also a large population of your average Joe. Both exist in the downtown area. I can't speak for everyone, but I'd personally love to have an ATM here.

They usually don't wait for one. Such a small transaction isn't worth attempting a nearly impossible double-spend.

I believe there is one tag inside your fist and one outside, the inner for secure-ish stuff, and the outer for more public stuff.

Alright, good to know. This may be a bit too much to ask, but could you send me a PM when it is on GitHub? I really don't like having all my BTC on my computer, but don't want to have an unencrypted key.

Hey! I sent you a tweet the other day, when do you think BIP38 will be added? I ordered some holograms and bags, and would like to be able to use them.

Nah, it doesn't have your private keys, as far as I know. Rather, it acts as a gateway to your BTC in Coinkite's stores to spend easily.

Oh, I guess you're right. Sorry.
