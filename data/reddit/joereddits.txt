Hi bitofsense,
I'm Joe, the Founder and CEO of BTC.sx and Magnr.
Thank you for your feedback. I'd be happy to address any concerns with trust and liability.


Magnr has been created as an investment service. Under FCA guidelines we have modelled our approach to an official classification which puts us under a money management category. This is a regulated activity in the UK although we have FCA authority recognising that we are operating outside of the current framework.
TLDR: Yes we are unregulated and the FCA recognises our status.
We are not under any circumstance calling ourselves a bank and are very careful not to do so.


Magnr savings is a product which does not charge fees. The wider company will be legally liable for the return of client funds under a scenario where depositor funds are lost.
Depositors should be aware of and comfortable with their funds being under Magnr management.
Our policy is to offer an interest return for low risk investment activities managed by us. This is by all means not a blanket statement declaring that there is no risk whatsoever.

I don't get it. What is 'Cake Day'?

Great initiative to further educate the world about blockchain and bitcoin tech.

Good effort! You are clearly a subject matter expert!!! I can learn a thing or two about your presentations.

Payouts are made from BTC.sx revenue and interest charges.

True. Wealth takes on a different form once you get past a couple of mill. It all becomes about assets.

This is by far what I'm most worried about. Now they will build a picture of earnings too. Little by little...

Sad and I hope it won't become true. Given that bitcoin gambling sites are so popular I doubt it will.

Lol. Love it.
