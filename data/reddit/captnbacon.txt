My FUDometer is at a 3/10. I’m pretty sure you can do better.

Fair enough. I guess short selling is shorting and what I stated is the position someone takes on an asset.
My apologies.

You can also sell it in changelly.com
Note: I am in no way afilliated to that site.

Actually you can take a short position on an asset by several ways. Buying a put, selling a call, a futures or forward contract stating that the underlying asset is going to devalue, are some ways a person could go short on an asset.

It doesn’t matter if there’s a physical delivery or if it’s cash settled.
In fact I would argue that unless you’re a producer and you need to actually buy or sell a commodity at a future date it’s actually less of a hassle to buy the cash settled futures contract. 
Even in that case, the hedger should be indifferent because the cash gains should offset the increasing (decreasing) cost of buying (selling) the commodity in the spot market.

Aren’t Giffen goods inferior goods by definition? A Giffen good cannot be a Veblen good.
Imo BTC might be a Veblen good though.

That is actually a good example. Let’s say Timmy has enough money for 1 pie today. Since he lives in a deflationary environment, he knows he could buy two pies with the same amount of money tomorrow, or three pies the day after tomorrow.
I guess in a sense it would fix this flashy consumerism we are experiencing nowadays, but it for sure does not help economic activity. It will help savers more than it will help borrowers that’s for sure.

That’s not how it works.

WTF MAN?

I don’t think that’s how you should interpret the distribution.
Assuming the distribution is normal, what this graph is telling us that out of all the people who own Bitcoin, 2.5% are innovators.

The difference you state is in the deflationary interest rate. I used 100% for the first day and 50% for the second while you used 1%.
I just used arbitrary numbers to make a point. I actually don’t think the deflationary rate would be that high.

Why don’t you amend the bank transfer and correct the concept?

Do any of these exchanges work for international investors regardless of where they're from? I'm asking this because I currently live in the dominican republic and even though i have a spanish passport I'm finding it a little complicated for people living in third world countries.

Im not an anarchist of any kind but i do believe in laissez faire, or libertarianism. The less those fools manage my money, the happier i become.

I'm not going to come back at you, but what I can do is tell you briefly what I believe and why. Throughout the years governments have proven to manage resources less effectively than private firms. I believe that consumers get better results when the companies that are producing whatever we need are constantly competing to give us the best. When governments give us a service or product they don't necessarily have to improve what they do (see monopoly) so what we get is basically a product or service that could be improved by competition. Consumers will always benefit from competition. This is just from one perspective, if you want me to I could also explain how government intervention can affect negatively the  economy it wants to protect.

I'm starting to feel bad for this currency bot.

I've done this and I can agree it works.
