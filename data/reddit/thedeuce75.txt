I like BIG money and I can not lie, you other brothers can't deny. That when new investors walk in with a buy order to place and all that capital in your face.......

He's like twelve fucking years old, but I dig his enthusiasm. Fuck it up vote!

I've had similar dreams myself. But in all seriousness there's gotta be somebody out there who's done it for reals. But that person's probably to busy having sex with Russian super models to have the time to post his/her story on reddit.

Thanks, I hope you're right.

Actually, I posted this as more of question to the community. You might be able to tell that from the "?" at the end of my title. But as I can not access a sizable sum of my money at the moment I'm not really in a great mood for snide comments. 
In other words you can go fuck yourself.

Time for me to start buying in.

Dude, people are just trying to express their reactions to one of the most crazy days in Bitcoins history. Not a big deal. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:41:22
Right! I keep calling people and telling them how nuts this is but none of them are in the market. So they kind of don't give a shit.

Really, thank you Captain Hindsight!
