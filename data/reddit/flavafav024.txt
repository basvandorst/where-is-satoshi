Oh damn how do I get to his profile? He deleted all the messages and it didn’t show his name now and I went to search his name in the search bar and nothing showed up

Lol he deleted every comment in my PM’s ... good thing. I screen shifted everything
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:25:05
I think he deleted his account because it’s not showing up when I google it the page that shows up says
 “u/undefined”

Not at all I originally thought this guy was legitimate until I figured out he wanted me to send him bitcoins first before he just sends me the loan I asked for. Plus if  I was going for a “PITY ME SCAM” I wouldn’t of asked you guys if I was being. Scammed and if that is how bitcoin loans worked. All’s I wanted to know if it was a scam an/or if you have to send bitcoins to the loaner to confirm or whatever the transactions. Witch the more I think about it the more ridiculous it sounds .

People like me ask before they go through with something and don’t follow through with something that didn’t sound right. I do t fall in with the category of problem who get/got scammed because I didn’t get scammed ��

Awsome and right I feel bad for priori who fall for it.

Yeah had a long night and haven’t slept much. The more I think about it the more ridiculous it sounds. Thanks for just just answering my question and not being Dick to someone you don’t even know.

Dude I never begged he came out and offered me. Never PM him asking for anything .

So there’s no way to report or is it useless now. Most likely will just make a new account probably already has

Thanks a lot I mean it. ��I definitely want to report him. I will look up online how to do so. Unless it is easy to explain in a few short sentences!
