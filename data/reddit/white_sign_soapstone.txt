As someone who bought into Walmart stock for many years: there has been little to no growth in that stock for a long, long time.

I wish I had enough BTC to be a philanthropist.

I cashed out in 2015 when it got close to 90. Nice to see it doing well not but I'm still not terribly impressed.

Honest questions: How is this better? What if the flash drive dies or is lost? Can you restore it? 
I've been reticent to start buying into altcoins because I don't trust how they're held but I figured something like the Ledger will give me some confidence -- but damn it's pricy.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:43:15
Yeah I just need to nut up and get a Ledger
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:54:20
That's where I had been concerned. I've been wanting to delve deeper into cryptos but not having a hardware wallet seems to worry me. I've recently put a few hundred into BTC but going deeper seems to require one.

Bought my only decent chunk of coin at 4800, still HODLing. Major anxiety about it, even though I didn't put in more than I could afford to lose.

I've just been using a wallet on my phone and pc thus far.

What are their fees like?

What do you like about KeepKey over something like the Ledger Nano S? The Nano seems to support far more cryptos than anything else I saw.

He definitely seems positive.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:41:34
There is wisdom in that, for sure.

That's moon lambo level right there.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:42:51
Waiting is so hard when you want to buy that dip
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:43:31
Wish I was capable of that level of optimism.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:03:18


Wish I had the self-discipline to not check the price as often as I do. Instead I constantly have some sort of chart up while at work. 


I have been trying to keep my focus on BTC for long term but I'm foolishly also looking for my lambo opportunity and want to dip into some of the cheap ones. Before that a hardware wallet seems like a good idea though.


Haven't been taking any unneccesary financial risks but it's still nerve-wracking for me.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:28:50
I guess I just need to take the plunge.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:27:32
I'm probably the wrong guy to ask, but I want to venture into other cryptos and Ledger seemed to have really good support for that.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:20:42
Yeah I want to get one too. So hard to chip away at that goal these days
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:34:42
I sure hope so.

Coinbase is kind of terrible. I'm still pretty inexperienced so I use it because of its simplicity, but the fees are high and the transfers take forever.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:45:30
Or that I'm just an anxious person. Doesn't mean I don't see the value of investing.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:04:40
They just seem so expensive for how tiny my investment is. The Ledger Nano S seems awesome though.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:19:22
The fees for CC use are so crazy though. I die a little bit inside every time I do it.

The high fees on CC purchases turned me off on the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:19:01


They have a pretty long list which I believe is on their site.

I love that BTC has made so much for so many, but it seems like such hubris to act like there is nothing to worry about when you're looking down at us from your moon base lambo racetrack.

@_date: 2017-09-11 17:22:47
Yeah, I quickly learned to transfer to a wallet in my control.

I've simply got a R7-1700 and a GTX 1080 (not ti). Is there anything out there that is worth my time to mine?
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:28:45
It took me 6 days to get funds transferred from my bank account into Coinbase. Purchases are fast if you already have money in your account or use a CC though. The latter has ridiculous fees.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:21:52
I have faith. I don't have that much faith
