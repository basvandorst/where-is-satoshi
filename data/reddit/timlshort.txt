Well, since I have two PhDs it is extraordinarily unlikely that I am a moron.

So you are here exemplifying the Anecdotal Fallacy I write about

I am up $30,000 today because I am a doofus and having two PhDs proves I am stupid.  Good luck with those lines of argument.

It's a pretty good approximation to that when Bitcoin boosters are unable to supply any examples of serious investors holding   They say things like "Bill Gates says it is is the future" and mix it up with the Blockchain or wallet companies or other investments which *are not* holdings in Bitcoin.  If I am wrong, give an example

because that is the only source of "value" in a bubble like this

The skills required to obtain a PhD mean that anyone with them is highly intelligent.  This is empirical anyway; you can check the data and you will find out that people with PhDs are intelligent.  
You might want to read my article before assuming things about it. I explicitly mention that people mix up Bitcoin (a Ponzi scheme) and the blockchain (an extremely interesting and legitimate technology)

Why would I be bitter?  What would I have to be bitter about?  Why do you need me to be wrong?  Why would my emotional state affect the quality of my argument?  Why don't you challenge my argument rather than just insist I am an idiot?

The straw man fallacy is to caricature one's opponent's position in order to have an easier time arguing against it.  I have not done that since I have quoted exactly my opponent's position.  If you can do better, go ahead and supply a list of major investors who are holding Bitcoin

One of my PhDs is in philosophy, so I am much more likely than you to have an understanding of what the straw man fallacy is.  Also I don't make fallacious arguments.
You can't counter it with facts.  Because there aren't any major investors holding Bitcoin.  It would be really easy to prove me wrong here.  I can give you a list of 100 major investors who are not holding Bitcoin.  All of the investment banks for example.  
And in any case, you are proving my argument by example.  I am an investment expert and you need to distrust me in order to hold Bitcoin.  That is exactly what you are doing
