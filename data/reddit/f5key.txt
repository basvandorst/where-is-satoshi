Can someone explain why Circle is better than Coinbase? (I'm not arguing it isn't better. I had tried Circle when it first came out and Coinbase ended up being cheaper when I tried buying the same amount from both at the same time, but I haven't paid attention to Circle at all since then).

Trolls huh? lets get one thing straight, everyone here other than the buttcoiners want what is best for bitcoin. Even the clowns you help enable who are trying to destroy the original vision of bitcoin are doing what they think is best. But instead of creating streamcoin to fairly test their shit ideas and compete with bitcoin, they've hijacked bitcion.

RIP micro-transactions, you once had a bright future, but streamcore is trying to strangle the life out of you.

Sure stalling would be par for the course, but soon enough it is evolve or die time for the project. The project as it stands now has already lost most of the support from its early majority adopters; the hostage takers have put adoption into reverse.

I know right :) and here I am trying to talk to you while you're just arguing with some imaginary person making imaginary arguments while ignoring all the real issues and arguments we're making. Ye,s i'm sure its all about incentive that's it, you figured it out, nothing else to see here. Good work Sherlock. Good to know geniuses like you are helping to spread your valuable information.

Where's the hidden camera, because you are a joke. The comments didn’t settle any of the important points. Enjoy your centralized protocol while it lasts, the coins on that branch will soon be worthless.  :)

I'll guess you have no idea or no interest in the original mission of bitcoin.  You're just another newcomer here to "fix" bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:02:53
Yes, I for one welcome our new overlords. All praise blockstream, may their profits come before our liberty.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:15:44
Their nodes getting the majority of transactions. I guess I missed the section in the bitcoin white paper where it says transactions should occur off chain. This new Maxwell coin is the altcoin.

I did read the article and comments.  I also read your lame post about incentives. The issue isn't incentive or trying to create successful sidechains. I hope the they are successful with their projects. I want blockstream to work on their projects but not while putting Bitcoin in a chokehold. A private company should not effectively own Bitcoin's development; yes even if they think they're just doing what is best. Try and think a little, incentive is not the issue, all sides of this issue just want Bitcoin to succeed.
The hard fork is coming. I hope blockstream still soldiers on even when the don't completely control the development of Bitcoin.

Nice work of fiction. I remember when this community was completely dominated by libertarians. Now Greg has the project in a chockehold and our dreams are starting to fade. It is not surprising that as the community grew the ideals of reason would get watered down, but it is disappointing.

The other side must just be thinking the opposite of what i'm thinking... no, wrong. Nice straw man that's not what I think at all. But I do think your analysis of the situation is pretty accurate.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:30:46


No, maybe there is someone out there who holds that view, but that certainly isn’t what I consider failure. Bitcoin only completely fails if no one uses it; but it can have several other failures such as failure to become mainstream, failure to become a global currency accessible to anyone with a connection, failure to be fungible, failure to be secure or decentralized enough from malicious attacks, etc…


No not at all, democracy implies the minority has to suffer the majority. I think this is an open source project that people are free to support or not. The most successful crypto currency will probably also have the most people, but that’s not the same thing as democracy.
Blockstream has a biased view, nothing wrong with that but it needs to be balanced by people who don’t wet themselves over the idea of sidechains for the common man and bitcoin blockchain for the elite. I don’t support Classic because I’m anti-sidechain, sidechains will have a useful role to play but they don’t’ exist yet. Some reasons why I support classic
* Currently control is too centralized in the hands of Blockstream. That’s not healthy for a system that is going to need to be robust to stand up to competition and attacks.
* We shouldn’t cripple bitcoin to serve the lightning network that doesn’t exist yet.
* We should never cripple bitcoin for the purpose of creating a tiered system (blockchain for the elite players, lightning network for the rest). Limits should be set by what the market can bear, and miners can bear a 2MB limit.) It won’t be a tiered system you say, fine prove it, lets see it work without artificially high bitcoin transaction fees.

Aren't they still in closed beta? Developers have tons of opportunity for contributing on products where we don't have to get on our hands and knees and beg "oh please let me help add value to your platform."

Bottom line, I don't have to choose him as a lender. I'd walk away and never look back.
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:12:24
You can cooperate with the intent to subvert later after you've gathered more strength. I agree though it is good to stay focused and not lose sight of that goal.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:41:13
However you want to describe it, the end result is the same. I will be voting with my feet. If bitcoin doesn’t take this moment in history to try and be a global currency, a competitor will. May the best coin win.

This reminds me of the MakerBot controversy. There is a defined mission that the community donates its energy towards furthering the cause of and then it is hijacked and the course no longer aligns with what its early community members had signed up for.
I became a supporter of bitcoin 3 years ago in large part because one of its goals was to be a global currency. I’m not interested in being part of a project that is merely a settlement layer for Blockstream. I will jump ship at first opportunity when I see a viable option for a coin that could actually become a global currency (Ether maybe? I’m not sure yet so I still hold bitcoin for now...).
@_date: 2016-10-01 13:25:14
You're asking fans of Bitcoin - the decentralized, p2p, open source project - to show interest in a closed system... good luck with that. I'll check back in a year or two to see if Code Valley is permissionless and open source, or if it went extinct.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:49:43
Well said. I'm also looking for a coin which will follow Satoshi's vision like bitcoin used to. Don't expect much of us to stick around for a coin that won't try and compete to be a global currency.
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:53:51
should have changed "key" to "private key" to have the joke makes sense after you changed "gold" to "Bitcoin"

"Bitcoin did not respond to a request for comment about TRR."
@_date: 2016-10-02 12:34:45
Its possible I'm mistaken, but it is my understanding that the platform is not open source, it is a centralized repository as this company controls it and collects all the fees for listing vendors on it. Any fees should just be distributed back to the hosts and hosting should be open to anyone if you want this to be open.

Yup, she wants to open a water park without the water.

How reasonable is it to trust people I don't know to not further the interest of Blockstream at some minor expense to Bitcoin. Ideally they should have a mutually beneficial relationship, and maybe they will, but so far the way team Blockstream have been handling this has been a source of quarreling and distrust. Where is the reasonable short term compromise to show goodwill and build faith with the Bitcoin community? Once they can start substituting measured reason for stubbornness, that is the path towards earning trust.
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:59:59
At this point I really do hope Lightning Network and Blockstream succeed but if you're looking for blind trust, you won't find much in the bitcoin community. Skepticism is likely a trait many of us share. It is not easy for me to completely ignore a conflict of interest, and I'm interested to see how this blocksize debate turns out.

Good article, although only circumstantial evidence is offered up for "Myth  No hard evidence either way, I wouldn't call this "Myth Busted" just yet. Mythbusters would have to label this Plausible, but unlikely.
