thanks to his dismal security practices, i was able to dump enough code to compare with bitscalper's. the style is absolutely identical, as is his style of evasion and sociopathic cleptomaniacism.

i've dumped some of the code and it looks exactly like bitscalper's style. he even talks the same and leaves the same fscking holes in his code. wow. i wondered where bitscalper went. when can we have our money back you sociopathic scammer?
@_date: 2012-08-16 12:17:13
theres no other explanation. he must be bitscalper. his code looks like it, his speech appears similar and he has the same stinging disregard for any security policies and giving excuses.
@_date: 2012-08-16 12:28:42
did you pay the 90 bucks an hour security professionals with profits from your bitscalper scam?
@_date: 2012-08-16 12:22:08
why is anyone using another bitscalper site anyway?
@_date: 2012-08-16 12:24:11
dont forget that he is bitscalper

So you downvoted it because you don't like the business model or because you don't understand how useful it is to some people?

I just tried on a bitcointalk.org socky and it works. You pay, leave it open, and you're out of jail.

Refreshing alone doesn't work, but that is more or less what this site does apparently (except in a way that actually works).

Who is stealing people's money? The site provides a service in exchange for a modest fee.

Read the newbie sub forums. It's obviously of value to skip newbie jail completely or there wouldn't be a new thread *weekly* asking why someone can't post and when they'll be let you. What you mean is it's not valuable to you.

for bitcointalk.org

The man makes sense. To the newbie sub forum!

Speaking of, did you get my 0.01 BTC I sent you to try out newbiejail.org?
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:58:34
For convenience, you pay 0.01 BTC, it detects the received payment, loads a script to auto pilot your account to random threads in the background. You don't have to spend 4 solid hours before breaking out of newbie jail and it's all automatic.

I found it interesting the reaction to this last time I posted it. I'll happily send someone 0.01 BTC to test it out.
