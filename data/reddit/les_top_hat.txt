That's actually hilarious it's not included as a disadvantage. I guess sometimes we forget the little bubble we live in.
What's the deal with physical bitcoin coins that you see? Are they just a novelty?

Thank you for your intelligent comment.
People here hate inflationary fiat currency. So they buy deflationary bitcoin. But then they never spend it and just Hodl (because duh, it's deflationary and therefore gaining value). And finally, they complain about bitcoin not being used as a currency and instead as a store of value, not realising the cause of this is because it's not inflationary.
They can't admit inflation is what makes fiat a successful medium of exchange. They also complain because they want bitcoin to replace these fiat currencies.
I dunno, there's just lots of circular, nonsensical thinking.

It's because people don't want to invest time, money and emotional energy into a tool. They invest into a purpose.
The purpose is to take down the status quo, take down inflation and take down the evil fiat. Bitcoin is their tool to achieve this.
The tool is amazing and revolutionary, but it's not going to meaningfully achieve their purpose.
We're seeing a mixture of the first three sign of grief/loss: denial (bitcoin *will* take down fiat), anger (this isn't what's supposed to be happening; bitcoin is not a trading asset/store of value!) &amp; negotiation (it can still be a currency if you guys actually spend it).
I love bitcoin. It's doing great things and will continue to do so. It won't replace all fiat currencies.

Thank you so much for saying what needs to be said. Those of us with actual knowledge of economics cringe at the crazy comments that show a clear lack of understanding. Has anyone done a proper write-up of how a bitcoin only economy would work?
