This was god’s work, he’s trying to tell you to not sell. You’ll thank him come Wednesday 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:46:42
Nice work, glad you guys are gettin the discount
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:45:02
My increase was to 1250 with credit card. You can do bank deposit up to 5000 though 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:00:22
Buy the dips, or sit. Sell should not be in vocab
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:11:42
My money is that the noobs who got in at 10 k bailed after it went from 11,300 to 8900 in about 5 minutes. But you could be right 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:09:49
Yeah if this is not and obvious HODL time then I don’t know what is. O well, a sacrifice to the gods it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:07:50
I agree but for every person with weak hands is 5 bulls waiting to take their coins at a discount. This is the environment that will keep this thing propped up. Yes we will see a dip, no it won’t go to 5 k and no it won’t last very long 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:15:59
Sarcasmception though
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:45:26
Either this guy is a heartless troll, or way too confident. Don’t listen to anyone telling you to sell your shit and take out loans to buy crypto. Be smart.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:17:16
Seems legit
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:01:15
People will be drooling over 12 k and buy it real fast before we ever see 9
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:47:11
Nope, if BTC “crashes” bulls will just eat up the discount and it will continue, maybe at a lower price, but the money will likely flow to other coins and a new top dog will emerge 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:52:09
Stop order

All you can do is go with your gut. My gut says we see a decent upswing tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:43:33
Pretending that bitcoin will do the same things when it is 19,000 as it did when it was 3,000 is idiotic. It’s a different monster, the gains are different and the dips are different. Volume changes things. Don’t forget that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:39:20
You’re being trolled
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:54:42
I understand this concept, but does this not open up a huge market for a company to not be complete shit heads and thus create a demand for an ISP that goes by the current net neutrality laws. There has to be someone out there smart enough to capitalize on the fact that that’s what we want
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:46:20
For what it’s worth, I bought in at 7,100 and the next day it dropped to 5500 and my gut fell along with the price. But, I waited it out even though my brain was saying “PANIC SELL” and here we are two months later and I’m up 130 percent. This isn’t always the case, but hopefully this helps
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:03:42
Agreed, Moon! Moon for sure! But it all! Please
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:09
I almost wonder if it would make it go up. I feel that a huge reason why it keeps going up is because a huge distrust in our government and it’s choices. So I would guess people invest more, but could be wrong. Also if Trump is impeached, I think this babes going to soar.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:19:14

Whales trying to drive the price down and 20k sell walls
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:23:45

@_date: 2017-12-19 04:49:52
I think most people involved get pretty immersed in it and are interested, at least the ones that will last anyway. I bet you end up with a nice little club if you promote it and I could see people really getting involved. I know I would’ve loved someone like that when I was in college.

Those people are definitely making money, but you can make money trading with less you just need to have a pulse on the market and do a lot of research which can be hard to do.

Lol I’m all in on a small amount of savings, I didn’t mortgage my house or take out loans and I didn’t tell other people to either.  It’s fine you don’t get how irresponsible you are to suggest that to other people. Can’t talk to a wall forever. Have a nice life
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:14:07
It creates a chain reaction of selling , and then they post shit about how other people should sell and feed into FUD and then other weak hands bow out. And it’s prevents us from getting to 17 forever. And we’re tired of waiting dang it!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:38:22
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:54:41
The whales are shaking off the weak hands. Just hold on, we’ll be back up, maybe not until tomorrow, but we’ll be back. They want to trigger panic selling to create a dip in which they can buy in at a discount. It’s sad to see the noobs run. We saw a major dip after 10k and a lot of people sold off thinking that was the end and here we are doubled 3 weeks later
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:13:59
Saying it will shoot up is one thing. Telling people to take out loans is irresponsible. If you have good intentions, which I’m sure you do, good for you. But you’re not a financial advisor and don’t give people advice to put themselves in risky situations.  With that being said, i’m already all in and ready to ride the wave.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:08:14
I have greatly enjoyed reading this and I appreciate your existence. 10/10 would recommend.

Gdax, you can set a buy or sell order at any price you want and pay no fees. And as a bonus, it’s owned by Coinbase so your account you already have set up for Coinbase will also work for Gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:32:45
It does not, you can click deposit and then choose “from Coinbase account” and move money from Coinbase to Gdax

I’ll pour one out for him
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:55:14
I like coinmarketcap becuase it provides a link to wag coins website where you can read about their intentions and product. Another super helpful resource which sounds a lot like what your lookin for is, coingecko.com. It’s basically a rotten tomatoes for crypto. They rate each coin based on the tech, devs, community, and how often they improve the tech. They also give a short summary of essentially what makes this coin unique and then you can go from there. It’s an easier way to find the needle in the hay stack for me
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:58:18
I’m reading “digital gold” right now and it sounds like Silk Road is what really made BTC take off because it was actually being used as a currency. So thank you for your service.

No, we know. It is one hell of a bubble considering it’s been called one at literally every psychological number we’ve hit starting at 1.00. So yeah quite the bubble that has popped thousand of times but keeps going. I agree it is impressive

Lol not seriously
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:09:58
Which bubble, the one when it was at 1.00 or the one when it was at 100 or 1,000, 10,000? 100,000?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:21:07
No you’re right, it’s not like this doesn’t happen every major psychological price point. It’s a pretty textbook whale splashing, it’s expected, and it always plays out.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:50:49
In BTC we trust
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:53:49
Honestly, I do not trade, I just hold. Some people can make money trading but it’s very difficult, I think more often than not people cut themselves at the knee, as it can be very difficult to call the tops and bottoms correctly. But I am not going to talk you out of trading if that’s what you want to do. My suggestion to you if you are new is to maybe not start trading right out of the gate. Maybe just get some BTC or whatever you want to carry and just watch it, study it and learn as much as you can about movements and watch videos and read about technical analysis. Also diversification is great. You can hedge your losses by holding multiple coins. Like for instance currently BTC has been pretty sideways today but my LTC is charging up a bit, so I am making profits there.
I know that I would not be a great trader and it would eat me up watching all my miss calls and profits I could be making if I made a better call or just held. Currently I have a buddy that is trading and he would have made more money had he just held. But if you do want to trade, yes at the end of the day you want to take your profits you made in USD from selling and throw your chunk back in at a dip and then sell, and take those accumulated profits (potentially) and just keep snowballing upwards is the idea.
One example I like to tell people is that basically from 7,500 to now (about 19,00) many people waited and waited and waited for a significant dip like we’ve had in the past and they never really got one. So if many traders would have just bought at the all time high and held from 7,500 they would probably have a lot more money then they do now by waiting and waiting and buying at a higher price. 
Hope this helps, but by all means I am not downplaying trading, there is money to be made, it’s just not my strong suit, but I still study and learn everyday and I toy with the idea of trading alts in the future when I feel I have a better understanding of making profitable calls.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:15:18
It definitely pays off for them. I watched them do it from 7900 to 5500 and someone bought 500 million worth at a 
44 percent discount compared to 4 hours earlier. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:47:00
It’s tricky but when you click buy, after you put in your amount, you will see the price they are selling it to you for and it’s always a little higher than the evaluation. Same goes for selling. I like to sometimes click buy and then out in an amount to see what they would charge. And you don’t have to actually purchase, you can just see. 
My advice would be to move to Gdax. You can set but orders and do trades for free and it’s owned by the same company as Coinbase. It’s just not an apps and not as user friendly in terms of interface. It’s more intimidating but better and cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:22:01
Actually I highly doubt this is true. I think we see major growth from both
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:11:22
Rather than whatching the number, watch  the one week chart to watch for trends. What you want to see is higher lows,  basically look at each low point dip and if the one to the right is higher than the last and you continue to see that happen, chances are good that it will continue to go up and be healthy. It’s when those lows get lower and lower is where to expect a decrease 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:10:41
You get it, nice job. Make a plan and stick with it, no emotion, no fear. People cut themselves at the knee far too often trying to find the high and the low.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:10:25
Shit I misread what you meant. You want a limit order if you want to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:30:05
So I know I am just one person, by this saved my ass lol. I bought in at 7300 with a scary amount of money for myself. The next day it went to 5500 and stayed low for about 5-6 days. If I had access I think I might have panic sold. Sometimes I like to pretend like I wouldn’t, but I’m not sure that’s true. But the time my account cleared 10 days later we were up to 9,000 and I thank Coinbase for locking me out for 10 days lol.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:40:19
Low as in 18999
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:23:37
Yeah, Novogratz
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:01:38
Also a great way to watch your profits is to download an app called delta. You can put in your transactions and it will calculate your profits and put them in green and then above that will be the balance of your whole portfolio with your original investment amount included. I like it because I’m always curious how much I have made versus seeing my entire portfolio. It also has an option to convert your profit into a percentage which is pretty cool to see. You can also create a watch list of coins you are interested in and check out their progress.
Also I’m guessing you already know this if you are interested in trading, but just Incase you do t, use Gdax for trading, you can save a lot of money on fees by using them over Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:44
Yeah it sucks but once the usd is in, if you sell you can keep usd in your wallet and use it instantly to buy something else or buy back in later on a dip with no wait time
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:50:26
See you in June 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:58:20
I could definitely see the whales shaking off more weak hands here real soon. I bet we see a quick little dip in which people panic sell but the bulls will eat it 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:51:06
How short? I’m not saying a dip deeper than what we saw won’t happen. But I don’t think it’ll happen today
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:41:14
Very true, I think I’m more so in the mindset that I’ve watched a lot of people “wait for the dip” that doesn’t come. I also feel like the pump to almost 20k and dump is some whales testing the waters to see what sort of damage they can do and it didn’t do much. So I am personally under the belief that most people are holding pretty strong. But I could very well eat my words here in a week
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:25:51
It’s looking slightly bearish right now, keep a close eye on it, we could possibly see low 8000’s or high 7000, but it will probably be quick
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:11:05
I certainly don’t have the facts to back this up, but I guess I assume that “most places” aren’t back by one. I understand that there are places that are only backed by one, but I would be surprised if it was a majority. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:10
Exactly, you can set your price and say how much you want to buy (like $100 worth)

WHAT IS HAPPENING
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:16
So if I were to set a stop loss on Gdax for the future. Would it still go through even if the system is bogged down like it is today. Or would it have the same problem as people manually buying and selling

It’s a psychological boundary. It’s no coincidence that there is an insane sell wall and buy wall happening right now. It’s not logical but it is real, also it helps maintain steam and excitement 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:03:54
Oooooooo (facepalm) I get it now. I literally thought people were implying that when they buy it drives the price down because they bought so much. I’m dumb. Thanks lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:00:29
So the last coin is set to be released in 2140, so we won’t see that happening, but the idea that you are talking about is referred to as “the halvening” in which the amount of bitcoins released per block is going to be cut in half periodically multiple times throughout the years. I think right now it’s like 12 or 12.5 per block or per day? Something like that. In 2020 it goes to 6ish. Now of course that idea that of course the price will go up is probably true, but a lot theorize that the halvening is priced in. I happen to be on the side that it is not priced and we will see a price increase, simply just because everyone loves a reason for the price to go up, so I think it will just becuase everyone expects it to and will buy in. It’s feels psychological in the same way 10,000 had a psychological impact.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:20:35
Coinmarketcap.com takes them all into consideration to make one, to my understanding
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:50
At this point I’d be surprised if we did not. I’m guessing 9ish maybe 8500. Maybe
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:35:02
I think most people act like it’s just going to shoot up and I have a feeling we could see full days of what just happened in the last hour. I think it’s going to get super volatile quick

So i’m A noob and I see post like these and it doesn’t make any sense to me. I thought the more people bought, the price goes up. So why when someone buys a lot do they post on head to expect a dip. Not a snide question, just curious becuase I don’t understand 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:19:02
My thoughts exactly, if we come out of this strong like I think we will and add on top of that BCH scenario and not to mention China, it’s been through a lot and is a testament to anyone paying attention
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:52
I’ve got puke on my sweat soaked shirt and shit in my pants, but BTC still in my wallet. Kind of just looking around wondering what happened
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:40:09
This is a fun time right now and I think there is really only 2 dramatic outcomes. Either it hits 10 and we sky rocket to 11-12 which we would then inevitably need a correction, or it hits 10 and we almost immediately see a correction. So you can either wait and see if it pulls back to “buy the dip”, or just jump in and ride it out. One set back to the “buy the dip method” is that many people have been waiting for one since about 7500. If they had bought in at the all time high they would be making money, and it’s pretty unlikely that we will see a correction back to that point. If we see an immediate correction right after 10k I could potentially see 7500 being the bottom of that correction. But doesn’t feel likely as corrections are getting shorter and shorter as the space grows with more users. I bought at all time highs a month ago and I am now up 35 percent so it’s up to you.
Also, some of the best advice I’ve ever gotten is that whether the amount of money you are putting in is 1,000 or 10,000 your answer of wether to buy in or not should be the same. Essentially you are not making decisions based on how much you are putting in, you are simply asking yourself, do I think it will go up or not. If the answer is yes, then you throw whatever you can at it that would not ruin your life if you lost it. If you wanted to say put in 1000 I would probably dollar cost average as a piece of mind in which you maybe put in 500 now and wait and see what happens. Maybe it drops 25 percent, at that point you really want to put in the other 500 and now you’ve made a pretty nice move of getting in with a potential to make money if it’s sky rockets while simultaneously being ready to bitcoin at a discounted price if it drops. If you’re feeling gutsy and want to throw it all in, go for it. It’s what I did and it worked out, but it doesn’t always.
P.S. I threw a scarily large amount of money in for myself personally and watched the price drop 25 percent the next day. I saw that this drop or “correction” is very common in the charts so I waited with a frog in my throat for a couple days and it finally came back and i’m Now up 35 percent, so if you do go all in and it does a drop, have a strong hand, don’t cut yourself at the knees. 
Also i’m Not a financial advisor and the greatest thing about this is whether you win or lose, you made your own decision.

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:01
Basically everyone is freaking out. My gut tells me it’s best to not react to the frenzy. This is quite literally top 3 most monumental days in bitcoin history so bound to be a lot of volatility. Follow your gut as you should. I’m staying put personally
