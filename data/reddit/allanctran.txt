I do have other drive that are bigger and are able to hold it, but not sure on how to go about it.
EDIT: ok I've google up the wiki page I think it'll show me how to do it there :)

what did the warning say?

With the ongoing incident with MtGox, I wouldn't be surprise if someone in desperation would click that email link.

Sorry to hear what happen, maybe there some way of contacting support from the game company and get the cd key revoked and reissue a new one to you?

If I switch to multibit will I be able to still use my bitcoin-qt wallet?

Their site is up, wth are you talkin about?
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:12:28
Was afraid of that. Is there anyway I can move the bitcoin-qt folder to one of my backup hdd (which is larger than my os hdd). If possible  how would I go about telling the bitcoin client that the block info data is on this hdd.

Wow this is fuck dup, as if it isn't already enough that a lot of people has lost a lot of money/life saving/life. To have more fuckers out there trying to pour salt on the wound. I can't even find the word to describe how disgusted I am at this.
Thanks for the ups.
