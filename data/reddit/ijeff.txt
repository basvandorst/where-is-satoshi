That's basically my point. The value of either doesn't matter much. The forex market and crypto exchanges are one side of the coin. Where the USD really has value is in its use as money globally. That's where Bitcoin needs to be to really succeed - success for Bitcoin won't come from the exchanges. Even as a store of value it's dubious given the dependency on distributes nodes.

Bitcoin has a lot going for it and certainly has a first mover advantage but you overstate the level of decentralization. Unfortunately, Bitcoin depends on miners that are increasingly centralized and pooled due to ASICs being so capable and in limited supply. Much of the capacity is also run out of China by large mining operations. This introduces vulnerability to the network if that government ever decided to crack down on it. This is only one possibility and there are things that can be done about the problem. It is a resilient project with excellent decentralization of development, just not necessarily the distribution of hashing power. 
I don't expect altcoins to excel as currency. They'll be platforms. Everyone is buying into crypto as investments. Bitcoin continues to lose transaction support by vendors as it moves toward a store of value status. But it struggles there too due to volatility. There is no inherent value in cryptocurrency. Neither is there in gold, but it's a physical asset that is understood to be valuable even if you lose all other existing social structures. The same cannot be said for cryptocurrency. You can dig up your old wallet one day but there will be no guarantee the network is still running as you'd expect.
We are moving *toward* centralization. But the massive hashing power also makes the transactions more secure than any. Transactions secure but not necessarily network secure.

BTC has been going up in exchange value whereas USD is a controlled deflationary currency that drives a world economy. It doesn't matter as much what it's worth on forex when it is being used elsewhere.
BTC would be better off trading for less value as an asset, if it were transacted more as money. If you're of the opinion it should be more widely adopted and used. Otherwise, it's still a function of holding value in fiat currency rather than its own.

Mind you a lot of these older theories have been adapted in the modern area. For example, both saltwater and freshwater economist share an understanding that government spending is important during times of recession. Where they disagree is where to left off the throttle. Economics has matured significantly. We've conducted experiments and analysis of things that simply weren't possible before. We know a lot about how markets respond to certain things because we have lots of neat examples to analyze.
I'd recommend reading more into libertarianism. There's a **whole** area to study where earlier theories have been refined to be more compatible with reality. Remember,  economic models and political theory are intended to help us understand the world, but without introducing greater volume and variety of inputs, the models are little more than thought experiments.
I would also like to point out that the best way to refine your understanding of an area is to actively seek to disprove it. If preconceived notions can't stand up to comprehend critique, it means more investigation is necessary. But if you read only that which you expect to agree with, you build yourself a library of speaking points, not understanding.

Remember, the problem in the US is that resistance to taxation results in a lot of inefficiency. Americans spend more on private health care per capita than most countries, while achieving far worse coverage and outcomes. This translates to a lot of unnecessary cost along every link on the chain including administrative overhead in a physician's office far outstripping that of most other countries. If evidence could take precedence over ideology, you would see a cheaper cost to your services and **better** individual freedoms across the country. 
Think of how easy it is to move from one job to another without having to worry about your or your family's ability to access important medical care if it were to arise? Universal health coverage, supported by taxes, help allow labour to move across the economy with less friction. Labour mobility is key in any market economy.

Usually, firms will spend much of their money toward the end of the year on inventory. This both reduces your taxable income *and* builds your assets. 
Even as a mostly digital company, it would be a good time to purchase any computer or networking equipment you need. Any office supplies, etc. Do note that, depending on how things work in your country, you can also deduct a portion of the home space you use to run your business.

You mean not enough. Social programming actually saves money when properly implemented for a whole slew of reasons. I won't go too much into it, but all schools of economics recognize the benefits of certain kinds of spending like universal health care (helps with people living to contribute, family burdens do not harm productivity or result in greater illness, better labour mobility allowing more optimal use of human capital resources, etc.)
Things like guaranteed minimum income can do far better than piling on further subsidies to employers for more money than is transferred to the employees they're paid to retain. Tax rebates to firms that weren't going to leave, too, are more costly.
There are ways to spend money more wisely, but this involves overcoming the psychological barrier that makes most of us uneasy when it involves directing it toward those we think may not be deserving. But at the end of the day, we **know** it works out to being cheaper for all of us and creates a generally better society.
This way of thinking *is* compatible with some forms of libertarianism too. It just takes a different approach (see paternalistic Libertarianism and nudge theory as a way to encourage positive behaviours without the need for stringent rules - these measures can address the corporations front freeing up resources to focus on the fundamentals roles of government. While there is disagreement as to which are fundamental, security is a clear priority for all. Its not a stretch to extend that toward basic necessities to allow you to engage in society and the economy.

Not all physicians earn the same amounts though. It varies significantly depending on their specialization. 
While there is always room for debate over physician remuneration (note that, in the US, physicians don't break even on their cost for schooling until much later than most even at those higher salaries). 
You'd be surprised to learn that administrative costs can eat up over 10% of health care expenditures. For example, a comparison of 1999 insurance-related administrative costs were done between the US and Canada. Note: Canada's physicians are mostly private independent entrepreneurs, the only difference is that their provincial/territorial plan is the only insurer responsible for necessary health care services (you and your employer still have the option to purchase private insurance to cover pharmaceuticals, assistive devices, and dental - but this insurance is significantly cheaper than in the US). Canada has since spend significant amounts of money on reducing overhead costs; it's expected the gap is even wider today.
**In $USD per capita** (1999)
- Insurance overhead US - $259, CAN - $47
- Employer cost to manage health benefits US - $57, CAN - $8
- Hospital administration US - $315, CAN - $103
- Nursing home administration US - $62, CAN - 29
- Practitioner (e.g., physician) administrative cost US - $324, CAN - $107
- Home care administrative cost US - $42, CAN - $13. 
- Total Assessed: US - $1059 per capita, CAN - $307 per capita.
Similar analysis has come out recently finding a universal pharmacare program would pay for itself *and* provide more services simply by eliminating the poor bargaining positions faced by existing drug purchasers and by more appropriately pooling risk. 
What's most interesting about this is that, health care insurance is undoubtedly different from most other markets. You need it when you need it. Demand is very inelastic (if your loved one has cancer, you will pay everything you have and more to cure it). Economics plays a large role here since fundamental principles describe how costs can be significantly reduced by reducing the number of insurers (and their risk pools).
So a single-payer public insurance setup actually reduces costs significantly, improving coverage for less money, and improving health care outcomes as a result. Then, this all supports the broader economy allowing workers to engage in different career opportunities, or to have the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions, all without worrying about their fundamental health - further improving the economic benefits as more productivity is generated out of existing human capital.

This isn't inherently incompatible with Libertarianism. You can be against income taxes while also being against tax evasion. Allowing some to circumvent laws while others are left continuing to pay them only means there are fewer parties with a vested interest in addressing those tax policies and rates. 
Putting the structures in place to treat it as any fiat currency or common share can be a good thing for legitimizing the space. Some structures can be beneficial to a free market. You want people exchanging these amounts freely rather than hiding them away not knowing *when* some kind of overarching ban might come.

How much does it cost to hospitalize someone for serious illness? How much does it cost to incarcerate someone? How much does it cost for expanded policing? These are all factors that we know are related to socioeconomic status. 
Social programming are intended to avoid the more significant costs that are incurred when action isn't taken. Think of it as taking your medication rather than wait and only seek treatment after a cancer has spread. Your care now costs more money, your family is more heavily impacted, you've taken hospital capacity away from others, and you're not paying taxes while incapacitated.
The thing is, the United States has inadequate social programming, but overspends in a lot of ways. A cut to social programming means a lot of those other costs increase. But when you provide enough for people at the lower socioeconomic strata, you're both preventing a lot of pricier social issues and you're even helping to engage them more in the broader economy. 
Dead people don't pay taxes. Sick people unable to work aren't contributing. If you don't spend it on social programming, it doesn't mean you're just not spending the money. 
Another interesting example is subsidized daycare in Quebec (originally $7/day daycare). What did we see after the policy? Labour participation in women skyrocketed. The costs put into the program were more than paid back by the level of *growth* it created in the labour force participation rate.

The problem is, there used to be several ASIC competitors but there are only a few players now with clear dominance.  With them being specialized, they invariable end up high cost and in short supply (like the GPU market). It's not about weakness but in the type of proof of work used - it does the job well, it just doesn't address the tendency toward centralization.

Even for domestic goods, some kind of raw material from trade is required, where trade is always directly or indirectly linked to USD. Like most industries,  For example, until 2011, Japan was reading with China using USD like they would any other country. During that time, China was looking to reduce dependence on USD and to promote the RMB. But even then, the value of RMB depends on USD.
The value of JPY is measured against USD even when you don't know it. 
Interestingly, when there's global uncertainty the value of USD goes up. It also flourishes during times of prosperity since more trade means more demand for USD. It's the safest fiat currency so internationally, everyone flocks to it.

Reserve requirements are pretty antiquated though. They have minimal effect in the US and many other countries don't even have them. Instead of managing the assets side, they use capital requirements (and a capital adequacy ratio), which factors in the bank's solvency instead. It doesn't matter if you have a ton of cash in your bank if you have one building and a ton of debt.
They're antiquated when lenders of last resort are available to lend to the banks overnight at a rate set by the central bank. These rates influence the rates across the financial sector. An important monetary policy lever in some systems.

No, I just mean that consumer markets do still have their benefits. It's not a black and white arrangement. Are there alternate models? Absolutely. But that's not to say that there aren't areas with significant benefits in our current reality.
Inflation isn't objectively wrong. Suggesting anything so definitively, especially in economics, indicates you may benefit from further reading on the matter. 
If you look to countries like Canada, we have a robust system to regulate private Chartered Banks who must answer to public regulators on many front (e.g., their entire business plans must be approved every few years to ensure they aren't taking profit-seeking measures at the cost of excessive risk to the public). The same arrangement allows money to be used to support the more vulnerable in times of international difficulty, and to ensure stability in times of prosperity.

Tax attorneys can't do anything for you here. If you're curious, you can easily get in touch to find out your obligations. With taxation, you have to realize that, by default, your obligations are quite broad. What you're suggesting is similar to saying "they didn't say I would have to pay tax if I'm selling these water buffalo figurines I made" just because it specifies only in general terms. 
Even if you were to purchase a painting and trade the painting for an exact copy, if there was an appreciation in value that occurred, it's a taxable event. They don't need to be specific when describing them. They apply a blanket rule to all sources of income, it will be up to you to justify yourself during an audit. You cannot use the defence that they never specifically described your case.
If you're bottling air that is traded for other bottles of air with a market value, yes you are due to pay taxes on the change in value. If there is no fair market value that can be determined and trades don't occur with the intent to earn or retain value, you're golden! 
Just because you believe something, that doesn't mean it's defensible. I can tell you that your interpretation is missing some fundamental principles in how tax law works. No credible tax professional or lawyer would concur.

The Coinbase form you're referring to is for counterterrorism and anti-money laundering purposes, not taxation. Anytime fiat currency in large sums is moved, it needs to be reported in many countries. 
You're also off base on the taxation of crypto-to-crypto. It works exactly like property in the US and Canada. Gains in the value of property are a form of income and need to be reported. Look into the taxation of barter transactions.

Who said it's life-long? Just as you can decide to move out of a house, you can decide to move to a jurisdiction that does things differently. Parents can make decisions for you until you're an adult. After that, it is up to you to decide if where you are is right for you. 
I moved to a place that is more agreeable to my values. A jurisdiction that was spending money on certain things I valued more, less on things I did not. 
If you did not participate in the process of communicating with your political candidates, if you did not discuss and organize with others who feel the same way as you, if you did not vote at every level of the political government (city, sub-national, national) and at the political party level for each, then you did not even try to address those terms. You've given what is known as tacit approval by **deciding** not to act. 
I'm not American, but I am aware of the policy (this is why I mentioned in this conversation that one would have to both leave and renounce citizenship to really forfeit the benefits enjoyed by citizenship and tax). So when I am overseas, my government has no obligation to retrieve me. They will do their best to try, but there are no guarantees. With the United States, its citizens enjoy those guarantees. Significant sums of money are spent on recovery of US citizens abroad during natural disasters, political instability, and even economic turmoil. They are still guaranteed the right to access a US Embassy or Consulate anywhere in the world to receive services. They are also able to use their US Passport, which itself requires significant resources to keep respected internationally. 
I don't agree with the policy, but that's a decision that your government has decided upon (if that is your country). Mine decided not to. This is not about owing a government. Its about being a part of a community that is making collective decisions all the time. Decisions that affect their children. Children who have a choice to change the direction of those decisions, to accept them, or to decide to go somewhere else. 
Just as, if your parents were paying rent for you until 18 at which time you can just keep making the payments, leave, or renegotiate - this applies to citizenship. There is no signing needed. Not even with a tenancy agreement (after the first year you're typically a month-to-month so you can leave at any time after giving adequate notice). Nothing is forcing you to stay in your particular state/province or country.
If you're unhappy with the arrangements you think are being forced upon you but do not want to engage in the process that shapes those arrangements, then you should probably leave. Not freeload.

If someone who holds a particular philosophical position cannot answer how it would affect the real world or on what time horizon it could be expected to work on, it has not been well thought through.
Strong political philosophies, in particular, have often evolved based on back-and-forth positions, rebuttals, and revisions between competing thinkers. This is how some of the stronger (in terms of sound reasoning) libertarian positions emerged. Those without such exercise remain undeveloped.
Please don't take this to mean I reject the underlying beliefs. I just mean to suggest there are far more mature reasoning in libertarianism available for you to explore. 
If you *publicly* refuse to pay taxes, that is a very powerful political statement. If you *evade* and commit fraud in filing, that is little more than criminality.
Political activism almost always entails a degree of personal risk or sacrifice for the sake of change. Otherwise, it's just opportunism.

What? Of course you can see what they're doing. They're just protected from political interference. Auditing organizations in the way it was politicized in the United States was nothing more than for show. These organizations have very clear regulations and guidelines. Everything is recorded and movements are all public. While the Executive cannot interfere, everyone is well aware of what they are doing. Including your average crypto enthusiast like myself. 
These bodies report regularly to legislative bodies on their operations. For your country, that's Congress (all publicly available). You're misunderstanding that their independence is from the executive so that politics can't easily overcome sound policy (otherwise you can sacrifice an economy's long-term health for short-term political gains). 
As the main mechanism by which they adjust the money supply involves buying and selling securities (e.g., bonds). This isn't some backroom shady exchange of funds. 
You should read their annual reports. It is *really* like commenting on how we don't know anything about the conversations between Bitcoin developers without even thinking to check the discussion and development boards. 
I think the Canadian system is far more effective than the American one for several reasons, but what you're saying isn't quite accurate. Don't get me wrong, I do not like financial institutions but - your understanding of central banks is clouded with conspiracy theories that don't quite reflect reality.

What's wrong with either question? The latter is interesting because many of the merits of Uber are entirely translatable to the Taxi industry in the form of mobile apps to order rides to your GPS location, every trip logged for the benefit of all parties, mobile payment so a cab can't pull the "sorry the credit card machine isn't working" in order to force a cash transaction, surge pricing to encourage more drivers (love it or hate it) and the lack of tipping for a bit less pressure (although Uber has changed their policy on this).
This doesn't get at the parts they wouldn't like - for example, the much lower regular fares and the ability to circumvent stringent and costly taxi regulations. There are absolutely lessons to be learned, and taxi providers are actually the ones who need to learn them the most.

Yes, and they do not have appropriate responses for a lot of important questions. 


Except in the case of taxation, it typically results in increased enforcement efforts and penalties - not reduced taxation. This is one of those cases where a particular theoretical model needs to be reconciled with what actually happens in the real world (this is why many economic models fall short when translated to policy). 


This is an odd juxtaposition that misses out on the persistent and real activism that occurs for both of those interest groups. The people who take to the streets, voice vocal opposition to public figures, and by supporting political candidates who share their sentiments. It is **not** your casual marijuana user, or person expressing their sexuality in the privacy of their home who are contributing to the cause. There were very real efforts and personal risks taken to push those causes. 


It is not activism because it doesn't involve *actively* campaigning for political change. A hunger strike is not activism if you're sitting at home alone. Quietly refusing to pay taxes does nothing to campaign. It objectively does not lead to lower taxes, but greater efforts (and spending) on enforcement activities funded by large penalties. 
It's fine to do what you wish, but to pretend it's a part of an active campaign to for change cause is outright absurd.

As an aside, I have concerns with the Ethereum Foundation and **personally** prefer the Bitcoin development approach. But your critiques are unfounded. Having significantly more built on top of Ethereum doesn't diminish the platforms, even if I think tokens are generally junk. Transactions are still significantly cheaper than what we will see with Lightning Network, they're still faster in spite of all the platform bulk, and the potential for hash power decentralization is far better than with Bitcoin. 
I encourage you to try an ETH transaction. Not because I think ETH should be supported, but because I think it's important to be informed of how these competing technologies actually work.

Hm? I didn't say politics. It's all about whether or not someone has studied in a way that's critical and based in the real world, and the alternative who may be politicized and ideological (really, the only ones purporting a free market is something that exists outside a textbook - these folks are a dying breed). 
Monetary policy is distinct from politics in most countries.

Well, for fiat it is the fact that you must legally accept the legal tender as payment for debt. This is why the Canadian dollar doesn't work so well in the US except for times when it's stronger than the USD. Nobody takes it (debt or otherwise). Not without hefty cost, at least.
If you have assets that can't easily spent or be easily converted to an accepted currency, it doesn't matter how much your token are worth if your landlord won't take it.  Decentralized exchange dominance can't come soon enough so you can both exchange and hold your assets every day.

Its not a tenant and they're not fragile theories. They literally run the current system. 
What you describe is limited to the content of an intro class. Any economist will tell you that models have their limitations and only try to reflect the real world. Contemporary economics takes into account a whole slew of exogenous factors. Keynesianism is about using tools to keep an economy working in a certain way... Not all that unlike what Bitfinex was trying to do with Tether ��. Keeping the dips from going too low then doing a bit of a burn (but far more dubiously).

Just because something is given a name, does not make it a comprehensive ideological position.
If you're truly interested in libertarianism, I would suggest some reading John Rawls' A Theory of Justice and Richard Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia (in that order). 
 If you are against taxation, then you should want there to be no taxation loopholes or evasion so that everyone needs to face its impacts - in turn increasing the odds of finding more allies to actually change things. Otherwise, tax fraud just ends up leading to higher costs as more money is spent on addressing it. It feeds into a vicious cycle.

It can be argued that you're the thief by trying to skirt the very same rules all of your neighbours are following, without also giving up your right to use the services and protections it pays for. If you disagree with taxes you're paying, speak up and get then changed in your country. 
Before you suggest it, saying nothing would change is a lazy answer. Don't forget that most cryptocurrencies are *very* easy to track. It will be trivial to automate much of the analysis. You'll owe the taxes plus interest for the tax fraud. It's not worth it.

I'm sorry, but you don't know enough about economics if you're saying that. Literally the equivalent of anti-vaxxers and homeopaths who dismiss all research. Conflicts of interest are absolutely a concern - this is why you need to read research yourself and avoid what is interpreted by bloggers, journalists, and laymen. 
Every paper has this very clearly identified. Conspiracy is not an excuse for laziness in actually reading through and discerning the material (not suggesting it is laziness on your part, but this is a common issue). 
There is endless research on the problems with sugar consumption. Stick to reading reputable journals yourself. Someone may have been feeding you some very bad information.

It's pretty important in the medium and long term as well. People don't want to have to store their chequing and savings in one currency, then convert it into another for spending on a regular basis. Large fluctuations in value for any currency can be a bad thing, but it's less of an issue when you're always dealing with that currency domestically. With something like bitcoin, that volatility can be a huge deterrent unless you're okay with transaction costs each time you want to buy bitcoin to fulfill a transaction.

What. No. You're wrong on the electricity usage. There are different types of electricity generation. Baseload and peakers. Peakers are nowhere near as efficient to ramp up, but you need to do this daily. Baseload production is very efficient but, if nobody is using it, it'll need to be sold off cheap unless you've got a battery setup (like pump water back up the top and, when you need power let it run downstream through a hydroectric dam). 
Unless you are mining **only** during off-peak hours, it is a significant drain. Green electricity production costs a lot with limited yield because they do not dependably generate electricity when needed. Electricity is on-demand. So for whatever draw, you need to ramp up production immediately or you have a blackout. Renewable electricity (except hydroelectricity) aren't great at this. Also, you need specific conditions available so not every country can use each technology. 
Your statements are not backed by any of the realities. However, I do take issue anytime someone says it is completely wasted. As you say, it is providing a service. But for the long term there may need to be a reconsideration of the choice in algorithm (some are more efficient than others).

Our government isn't charged with enforcing the limits. It's our courts; they're independent and have regularly gone against the government's wishes (like in any functioning democracy). 
Why would we want to get rid of a government entirely? If we had any concerns, we could solve them within our federalist structure that ensures our collective and individual rights from the start. Policies can be changed at the provincial level and the federal level; powers are distributed between the two and none can entirely overpower the other. Our concerns can be adequately addressed by both levels of government. 
The Quebec provincial government has its own immigration policies distinct from the rest of Canada, for instance. Natural resources are similarly not the property of Canada, but the Provincial governments. We decentralize certain powers in order to ensure the various geographically diverse populations of the country can determine their own use of land, education, health care, and in the case of Quebec, immigration.

Police in the developed world outside of the US rarely make use of their guns. We're not paying them to defend us with guns, we're paying for their services in enforcing the law. Sure, we have riot police for when things get out of hand, but they're used maybe once or twice a year and mostly on standby. They have plenty of more effective instruments that see heavy use like tear gas and the occasional stun gun (last resort before the absurd use of guns). 
It depends where you are. In the US it's a protected **political** right. But for the rest of us, we don't need guns for security. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 01:52:47
Don't forget, we're talking different governments here. A fundamental principle of a federal democracy is a separation of powers. Our legislature and executive are closer than yours, but our judicial system is held quite separately. We've had constitutional crisis between a Governor General and Prime Minister that has gone to our Supreme Court who acted as arbiter between two government entities. 
Taxes are handled by Revenue Canada (and Revenue Quebec if you're in my Province). If you take them to court, you will absolutely be dealing with an independent part of the government that has no vested interest in defending the Federal or Provincial government, and serves the Canadian population. 
The most important point to note here is that you're explicitly describing structures and political traditions of the United States, while I'm pointing out that they are substantially different here in Canada. My conclusions cannot necessarily be applied to your country, but nor can yours be applied to mine. Our political structures are extremely different.

We have substantially lower rates of violent crimes across the board. We hardly ever have a situation that would be improved by the possession of a gun; we just don't have very much violent crime at all. Even the rates of theft are substantially lower. 
I'm not saying you, as a United States citizen, do not require a gun. The statement I take issue with is projecting it as a human right. I haven't heard anyone ever mention that Canada should have more guns. We just really don't need them. Pepper spray maybe, but when you don't have very much knife or gun crime, you don't need knives or guns.

Except we hardly have any gun crime. When we do, police responses are trained to be swift in order to diffuse the situation. Our minimal Canadian gun problem is isolated, but entirely driven by smuggling from the United States. What we focus on is ensuring education and health care are robust enough that people aren't driven toward gun violence. 
You're projecting the conditions of the United States to other countries, when the concerns are entirely different. Your safest cities are dangerous by our standards. It's worth keeping in mind. You may perceive gun ownership as a necessary part of citizenship in the United States, but it is quite the stretch to assert it as a human right worldwide and suggest restricting it elsewhere is an infringement of said rights.

Except the developed world have governments setup explicitly with extensive limits on power. If the Canadian or Australian acts up, we just challenge them and go back to elections. We don't have two cohesive parties either, and we can see drastic shifts in political power based on popular trends. 
Federalist governments notable have safeguards in place that mean national governments aren't a threat, and if we're collectively unhappy we can just change things around; democratically. Plus, guns are absolutely useless if the whole armed forces decided to go belligerent. Can you really defeat missile strikes and heavy artillery? Our countries are really good at dealing with guerilla warfare; it's not like the 1800's. Personal firearms do little against a belligerent government. The US Constitution protected firearms for the formation of militias back when invasions were possible and likely. Times have changed.

No doubt these things depend on local and national government structures. Things how you describe simply would not be possible within the Canadian government structure, but I can imagine how political corruption could cause some large issues in the United States (maybe not as drastic as violence against the population, but perhaps making entirely bad decisions and having two political options non-viable alternatives). 
My only assertion is that things differ. Guns would be far from a human right in Canada because we've established a political structure that allows and requires the population's confidence and consent, and protects individuals through collective security rather than require individual self-protection. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 01:10:35
Last I checked, crime rates in Canada were substantially lower than that of the United States. Your safest cities are considered dangerous by our standards. The dynamics are simply different between different countries, and guns are not a universal requirement among the developed countries. 
You seem to have incorrectly quoted me. The developed world has moved beyond the efficacy of militias and the need for gun ownership for said ground invasion and rebellious purposes. Just try to form a militia in the United States today, or Canada, Australia, Germany. It wouldn't fly. It was an important inclusion in the Constitution for its era, but the world has changed since then.
