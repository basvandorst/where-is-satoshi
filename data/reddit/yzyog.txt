When’s Indecide to sell (just bought in), coinbase is the best place to cash out to my bank account right?

@_date: 2018-06-13 06:49:06

@_date: 2018-06-15 19:47:55
I bought in, hoping for great things
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:12:42
blockchain.com right?
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:34:08
Bought in around 6.2k, been stalking prices since. Lets hope for a big rise
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:44:09
okay thanks for reassuring me.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:03:52
electrum is 100% safe other than for malware right
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:16:36
its fine to store it on blockchain.info until I get a ledger right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:46:25
where should I put it then?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:21:51
I stored it on my laptop on electrum currently, figured it was safer than blockchain.info atm
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:46:10
Lol I don’t think it’s going below 5k ever
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:34:18
okay, so its still pretty safe to use the laptop. I dont really do much on it so I should be good
@_date: 2018-06-15 21:47:33
I didnt buy this bitcoin online tho. I got it for selling something so I havent used a site
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:08:13
With electrum I install a standard wallet not multi sig, and standard not segwit right
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:08:36
I moved it all to my electrum to be safe 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:21:53
thanks, received it just unconfirmed atm. Which will probably process in an hour or so. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:49:19
I’m new too. Electrum was insanely easy to setup
