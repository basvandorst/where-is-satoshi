I don’t have the links saved but the links showed the addresses and proof positive of manipulative acts. But YOU can go research it yourself because you obviously defending it. But believe what YOU want, I’ve read and researched enough to know that the market is massively manipulated.

Not really sure what that question means but in relation to Whales, it’s as if Satoshi’s original vision is being actualized in the exact opposite manner he’d laid out.  
  
Whales run it all, and they are the new gatekeepers so in essence we’ve traded banking cartel families for crypto cartel groups.  
  
I love crypto, the idea the vision the philosophy but currently it’s as corrupted as the fiat money system is which crypto was created to battle.

Just stop it bro

Maybe you wasn’t reading the previous comments made by me but I don’t have the links saved but if you truly are interested in what I’ve said as opposed to being a dick like you’re doing now, you can easily hit google and type in “Crypto Market Whale Manipulation” and it’s a plethora of links that you yourself can easily read but I doubt you do that because you really don’t believe it 
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:22:30
Honestly it’s no way of truly telling where we are in relation to our crypto. The market has been MASSIVELY manipulated and manipulative news has flourished and only caused more manipulative actions and reactions.  
  
Honestly I don’t know and can’t call it right now. We could be at the beginning, we could be at the end, we could be in the cave for 3 days only to rise like Christ in the near future. Who knows?

I’m hoping, would love to be a millionaire just once in my life lol
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:01:48
Ok we get it, you think I’m wrong I think I’m right. It’s funny you ask for proof but present none besides your own take on the matter. At the end of the day, my research and readings makes me believe that the market is manipulated. You don’t have to believe me, I’m not on a campaign to get others to view it that way. But that’s what I believe based on my research. Just that simple
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:30:48
But according to   
$15,745 in 1929 was equivalent to $217,977.09 in 2014 while $73,298 in 2014 is equivalent to $5,294.49 in 1929
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:28:06
Prices, supply, you name it.  
  
There’s been information posted about whales buying up well over 60% or more of icos and there’s. Even postings of whale massively suppressing or inflating prices. If you control the supply then you pretty much control it all
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:28:19
Well here’s to hoping I have the right coins lol
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:30:38
I stopped reading at ....  
  


  
Never has liquidity and manipulation or manipulative practices been a means of confirming or disproving the latter. Just because there is “ALOT more” liquidity now (as YOU claim) than in 2013, it doesn’t mean there is lack of proof or evidence of manipulation. I don’t see how you feel because one can easy convert crypto to fiat that it proves lack of manipulation. There was “ALOT” liquidity in BitConnect until the house came crashing down. So again, what does “ALOT more” liquidity have to do with disproving manipulation?
