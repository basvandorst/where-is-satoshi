They gave me about...8 hours notice...but only because i was awake when the email came thru around midnight on a Sunday saying it would now.
I 2nd transaction went smoothly, I am going to try again on thursday I hope the rest of my interactions go well.

Kind of pointless, i have been trying for 3 weeks, everyday, all diff times...nothing...my last order would show, then disapear, then show...and now, as of yesterday, they cant even send my funds anywhere...they are just locked at bitcoin.
Im done with them. Ill pay the transaction fees with bitinstant.

I don't care about the resolutions. first impression is a bitch. FUCK coinbase. I will treat them like any other retailer of goods, you fuck you you lost my business.  But thanks for losing me money, and tying up my money for 5 days. it was awesome.
I have reported your company as a fraud for Citibank, and bank of america. good luck with customers.
Also. its not an empty threat, I have worked for both banks, and know enough people to flag you so even when you want to cancel someone, it will be to late, as it will be canceled ahead of time.
Thanks for your business.

EDIT : Citi, now has you listed as a fraud company, thanks for making me get a new acct  
as soon as I get ahold of some at BofA, you will be done there to.

you know... the 10/20$ isnt a big deal, but know I have seen it mulitple times, and happened to me, is enough to say.... well it seems like a scam.
not only that, they have everyones bank info....well not mine, I already called alerted the fraud team, so...sorry anyone that banks with citi, but you will be flagged, it seemed to good to be true... and guess what... it is

It took 3 weeks for my last order after multiple appearences...and now, i cant even get my money off of coinbase...ease of use is great...the few times it actually works.
I think im done with them as soon i can access my coin, and ill just pay the extra for bitinstant or bitfloor...this is ridic they cant even transfer your own coin

your system is a piece of shit, and if doesnt work, you should not be running an online currency exchange :)
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:17:39
I saw that..but that's beyond my tech knowledge lol
@_date: 2013-02-05 07:38:33
Call it want you want...they are a financial institution...not following all the laws, and not only that...they are not even good at following them...downvote all you want,,,
But eventually....everyone gets hit with the rules...and they will to...canceling orders everytime BtC goes up....on multiple people...is not gonna last long...i suggest you find a better company to idolize/work for...just a heads up from someone in the corporate world longer than most..,
But again...its the internet...do what you want...no reason to listen to insignificant me......but look at bitinstant...once the rules hit them...shit changed quick...but who am i to point out the obvious

Edit for spelling, im pissed. but you get the point.

I went on a drunken misspelled tirade about this 2 weeks ago..went in gave them a verf cell  did everything possible...my 2nd order did go thru...doesnt mean im not pissed about the 1st one...but regardless, it does work, takes a while...but still the cheapest.
I got blasted for this, but i keep seeing more and more people, and it worked this time, but at the same time, the "high risk" system they are using, needs to be much faster than 5 days, and canceling hours before, just still seems shady to me.  
Like i said, I gave them a 2nd shot...it worked.  If you got flagged even a day or so in, then fine, I understand, its new so they have bugs, but to cancel hours before just seems...not right. I dont like my money held hostage for 5 days, then I loose on gains.  
Hopefully it gets better, I mean, they at least pay you out on gains, since they place the order at cost, but it needs to be faster in some way, the canceling part, i dont mind the ACH wait.  Give them another shot, hopefully demand and more business, leads to better service for everyone. I will keep using them as long as it is clear sailing from here on out.

I ment, 5 days for the "high risk" detection, the ACH transaction, I have no issue waiting for.
I use Citi, so behind bofa, its in the top 3 banks i beleive, it may be top 5 now, since they closed some branches recently.
@_date: 2013-02-05 04:48:02
upvote... fuck these guys. im sorry your business model is fucked. im sure it would have went thru if the price went down....
I will stick to bitinstant and pay ridiculous fees, instead of deal with these theiving morons.
@_date: 2013-02-05 04:42:57
probably dont wanna work for a fraud bank.. just sayin
