Thank you! I first searched on blockchain.info (thanks and see that it showed up, so then I followed your suggestion, and now the funds are showing!
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:14:31
Does this then also mean that you can’t choose whom you’re buying from? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:02:21
So, you could put in a buy order at $49,000/Btc, buy it at that price from a separate address and suddenly Bitcoin has a new all time high of $49,000? Seems too easy and obviously hasn’t happened yet so what’s preventing some bored jackass from doing it?
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:13:12
So in other words, you’d have to buy up the entire float of open orders somehow and that would just be step 1? Are there figures available that show what this float of open orders is valued at any given time?
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:06:33
Great explanation. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:17:27
What am I looking at in terms of the columns?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:58:05
Even if the forked currency only sells for 5% of the initial currency (like bitcoin cash), that's still a 5% windfall though. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:16:01
This is very cool! Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:59:43
Not interested in doing it myself, but more concerned about others doing it and affecting the market. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:55:38
Got it.  Thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:21:37
You put in a small amount, let's say $100. Worst case, you lose $100. Best case? You stand to earn thousands. 
Going all in = Going full retard

If I'm using Multibit 0.5.18 and it doesn't appear to let me override or put in higher transaction fees, how would I go about transferring my bitcoins out of that wallet into something more up to date?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:22:15
It depends on where you're located.
As for gains or bubble - that's the million dollar question. No doubt there is a bit of a bubble forming, but in my mind, this technology has legs - it can be huge 10 years from now, so if you're in it for the long run, you should be ok.  
If you're in it for the short run, be very careful. As easily as it can go up almost 50% in a day like it nearly did on Cavirtex today, it can also drop just as quickly.
Yes, still viable to purchase - you can buy in fractions, so whatever you want to put in, not a problem.

I think that until things get settled and while people are getting used to the idea, and relatively abrupt 'coming out' party it's enjoyed for a month now, it is indeed of little use as a currency - that's something that will happen later.
MUCH LATER.
Essentially, we're in a phase where there's too much uncertainty, incredible uncertainty, and of course, greed - it's only after the novelty has worn off, and after the major price swings settle down that we'll see it go back to being a proper currency.  I imagine that the value graph would look something like this eventually:
The questions then are: 
1. what price will it peak at?
2. how many people are currently buying for longer term vs. short term? (long term 'investors' will help soften a crash)
3. how long do we have until that peak is reached?
If you look at market penetration of ideas and technologies 2% are the innovators, the next 18% are the early adopters, then later early majority, late majority, and laggards.
Assuming that the 2% is made up of 100,000 users worldwide (VERY conservative), that makes the early adopters segment 900,000 users, early majority 3,800,000 users, late majority 4,000,000 and laggards at 200,000.  Clearly though, 10,000,000 users is far too low a pool for worldwide acceptance, where the final number can easily be in the hundreds of millions, so we have to rework this formula to reflect actual numbers, then in turn be able to better guess at what point we'll get to the early majority phase (where thigns start to level out). 
If someone smarter than me can look at the volume and quantities of trades and figure this one out, we'd have some workable numbers to get a better estimate of when the bubble would be reaching its peak.

I nearly barfed when I read this. I'm rather surprised to see such a weak quote being printed by the FT, let alone on their front page - they generally are a well respected publication.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:58:41
I'm curious, is OP a vendor, and if so, what types of goods does he/she sell?
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:35:09
Thanks, but even aside from the duckup a few days ago, why was everyone going there in the first place?
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:31:31
Fair enough, but it's specifically these types of articles that need to be addressed otherwise, if it goes unchallenged, it sets the tone for future, worse articles. 
It's easy to point the finger at the obvious mistakes in the article, but what about the areas where he does have a point?
@_date: 2013-04-09 09:22:03
Something's not right there. I went in same day as you at Scotiabank, made two separate deposits, and both showed up in their respective accounts about 4 hours later. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:26:38
Where are you located?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:20:25
Just curious, and you've raised a good point - what's the risk of backing up a copy to Dropbox?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:28:28
And how do you determine that you've hit the floor exactly?
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:53:37
* Near zero fees
* Address some of the commonly misused anecdotes brought about in the media by lazy journalism. 
* Easy for **anyone** to invest - (got setup in 20 minutes + 4 hour wait yesterday), unlike investing in stocks, mutual funds, regular currencies... You don't have tons of middlemen taking a percentage and fees. This is particularly useful for young investors who want to just try it out with little capital. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:24:58
How is lag determined? I'm guessing that something similar is happening on CaVirtex (where the swings are much greater), but I can't tell what the actual lag is.
I also suspect something fishy is going on as there's someone who has a buy order for 400 Btc at $165 (it hit $289 yesterday).
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:38:23
Security and brand trust. As someone who's been reading up on this for a week, I've already seen a dozen headlines about online wallets or exchanges being hacked or crashing. 
An online wallet does have some benefits over an offline wallet no? (Correct me if I'm wrong)
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:27:10
Aside from the headline legitimacy, can someone explain what exactly happened Wednesday, what's to stop it from happening again, and what's to stop it from happening and causing a bigger drop? Was it bitcoin specifically, or an exchange that was hacked?
It's a hard sell if joe public sees "bitcoin hacked"
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:00:25
I wouldn't discount this as being so obviously wrong, as he does raise some good points. Yes, he's way off base near the end about hackers printing btc and running off, but I found at least one valid point about using it as an exchange medium for common things. 
With the volatility as it is, any sort of checkout or pricing process needs to be directly tied to an exchange for up to the minute pricing (feasible for online, less so for offline retail). Then there's the question, as a buyer of "which exchange is this retailer tied to?" and "are they adding an extra bit of a percentage to the current rate?".  You would need to verify the rate yourself each time you're dealing with an unknown retailer, and that rather slows down the process. I could only imagine the process of verifying the price of a chocolate bar at the convenience store. 
I could be wrong, but while its still as volatile as it is, this will be a very real problem that needs to be addressed (I am confident it will be, but we're nowhere near that yet). 
Sorry, but until more people of the general population have a solid grasp on the finer details of BTC, and while we're trying to educate those around us about BTC, I would avoid, dismissing such articles so easily and with such disdain, because to an outsider, you will sound arrogant and short-sighted. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:27:40


I can't speak to your account or the company you keep, but if this were as prevalent as you describe, they wouldn't be in business anymore. 


All Phishing. Believe it. 


If its as you describe though, nobody would use them, so there's no problem right? Either way, nobody would ever be forced to use PayPal's services and the very nature of Bitcoin means that whatever Paypal does it won't affect the dynamics. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:16:38
I don't see why the correlation between volume and price. Why should there be one?
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:59:05
I agree that it would be great to help bring this whole thing more into the mainstream. I don't see it ruining Bitcoin in any way as you're not forced to use them by any means.
Additionally, given all the DDOS and hacking going on, a more secure player would be welcome to the game. I would rather pay 1% for guaranteed security than learn-as-we-go security. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:44:57


Not in a manner that it crippled them.


Actually, no, they haven't been hacked.


This is not their policy at all.


That's a pretty amazing assessment given they probably haven't even decided yet how they're going to deal with this. Are you from the future?
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:44:07
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:42:31
Very strange. I asked in this sub a few weeks ago about PayPal implementing Bitcoin and the general consensus was that people would rather get paper cuts under their feet than see this happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:55:04
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:12:16
Noob question here - but with the roughly half hour it takes for a transaction to process, won't that be a bit of a problem for a company like this?
Additional question - wouldn't the volatlity of the value be a turn off for big companies? I can see that for anyone or any company that's even just slightly risk averse turning shying away from this.
Edit: added additional question.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:42:17
For those not familiar, this is Goldfinger from the James Bond movie of the same name. While it appeared he wanted to *steal* the contents of Fort Knox, the more devious plan was to actually destroy the gold, and in the process, raise the value of his own holdings of gold. 
The exact same thing could happen with malware or virus designed to wipe computers that have Bitcoin wallets installed on them. There's no theft occurring, just destruction of a scarce commodity to raise the value of one's own holdings. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:45:45
This would be that reason. Adapt or die, right?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:16:35
I was expecting to see everyone go falling down the hill shortly after. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:33:53
Yeah, that makes more sense. By having filled in 10s all across the board, you're almost guaranteed to have your survey results thrown out (when averaging for consumer studies, it's not uncommon to throw out the highest and lowest, or throw out the 100% and 0% responses)
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:22:10
Ok, so if I'm waiting hours for a trade, I can see the benefit, but otherwise, if my exchange can make my trade within 5 minutes, I'm good?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:20:04
I can't answer the first part, but as for new coins being minted - it's the people who are minting them who get to keep them, trade them away, or buy goods with them.
If you're not minting them but want to get some, you essentially open an account with an exchange, put some of your cash in there, put in a buy order, and wait a few minutes to a few hours for someone to come along and fill your order (ie,. take you $ and give you bitcoin in a trade).
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:17:09
I'll check it out, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:35:42
THAT's why they would get on board. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:48:10
A few questions - why all the hate for PayPal? I get the few odd people getting the shit end of the stick once in a while, but if they're that bad, why wouldn't someone have seized the opportunity years ago and appeared as the knight in shining armor? From teh sounds of the comments, it appears that the issue isn't with them isn't on the technical side, but on the service side - something that anybody with a few bucks and come and do a great job with.
