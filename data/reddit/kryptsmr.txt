Voilà is asking who Viola is and she seems pretty jealous

Je ne crois pas que ta question soit vraiment bien comprise... Pourrais-tu l'écrire en français, et j'essaierai de t'aider? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:50:51
Well, if I remember correctly, one little pig did think it was a great idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:27:02

Hi, my name is Warel Verr. I am the prince of the Nigerian province of Sawanjta. Me and my Royal family are victim of a political revolution in my home town of Verrani.
My father, the King, has over 120,000 BCH in his wallet, but he may not use it, due to opposition seizing his fortunes. We used to be a very wealthy family, but now, since the BTC revolution, our assets are useless. 
We need you to save our family fortune, to protect our children.
Transfer 10 BTC to my personal wallet and I will be able to deposit the 120,000 BCH to your account, since this will account for the transfer fees and the legal processes to have the funds unlocked.
Please, you are our only hope.

Seems like a very good source to me, 10/10.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:05:48
They send you more BTC when it dips? You've got my full attention. Care to elaborate for a friendly Canadian?

Who brings the mafia down, though? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:53:53

Actually I researched, then bought the Ledger. I watched the video from the manufacture, but wanted to make sure thatyI had not omitted a step or precaution.
I'm the type of person to always ask people around their opinion, to then properly have my stance on a matter.
I don't want to learn the hardway, so I ask away. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:32:10
Aye! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:37:10
Actually. I've been trying to have my identity confirmed with GDax for the longest while, but it keeps being delayed... Any way around it? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:29:33
Thanks for the info. I did research this on it, but wanted to make sure I woukd have all the possible tips, to prevent learning the hard way!

CNBC are calling Ver bitcoin Jesus.
We're like the Romans here on r/bitcoin. 
Errrrrr... Bad reference on this holly jolly day. 
Merry Christmas all, sorry to dump out the spirit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:13:53
I love the reference. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:38:10
So... Is that good, or bad for Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:36:06
I'm not debating brother, I was just bringing an explanation! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:09:24
I was all happy for you, and was kind of jealous that my Christmas sucked this bad compared to you.
You are such a bcasher.
Merry Christmas, keep the HODLING strong. �� ��

Canadian to Canadian, I'd buy if you're selling in the dip!

I feel you on this, but would just like to add something.
It's not entirely true about the "luck" thing though. Yes, luck does play a factor, but I would like to point out that you can always increase uour chances of luck, with either hard working, or smart thinking/planing.
Maybe the man in the BMW works crazy hours. Maybe he has a family an rarely sees them, because he supports them. Maybe he makes 500k a year, but spends 550K a year. Or perhaps he makes 100, and saves 90 - his BMW being his main source of expense.
There is actually a guy in town here that has a LOT of real estate. He's been working sincerity a very young age and started over 10 different businesses, which all eventually turned in profits, which he reinvested in real estate.
You see him around, he'll be wearing a Nike hoodie, some type of shoes he bought in the liquidation area of Marshall's, although he's around 60.
He lives in a garage (yes, a garage, whixhyhe has converted a small percentage to being an "apartment").
And what is his source of happiness? He has a very, very nice car. It's always polished and shinny. But it's not for the brand or the way people look at his car: he's genuinely happy, and drives it because it makes him so. 
And he'll complain about the flat tire, yes he will. Yet again, he's also the man who will secretly pay your groceries without you even knowing, while your standing a few people behind in line.
He'll probably look at you in a shitty way if he sees you in the parking lot. But it's nothing rude, it's just the way he and although he may look like he's judging you, he's actually happy that you're not following trends, spending a fortune in useless things , and that maybe, just maybe, you are taking care of yourself financially, saving money instead of buying some fancy car to show off.
Although the man in the BMW shouldn't judge you, either should you. It works both ways. You don't know who he is, what he is and what he's been through - and he doesn't know who you are, what you are, or what you've been through.
But all in all, keep on doing what your doing. Save money and cut on all expenses you do not really need. No matter your net worth, no matter your "society status", keep on saving money and investing in what you believe.  That's the only important thing. 
One day, you'll find what makes you happy. And that will be your source of joy... every compromise you ever did will be totally worth it, and you too may, like me live in a garage, yet love your car, and complain about the 1,000$ flats...
