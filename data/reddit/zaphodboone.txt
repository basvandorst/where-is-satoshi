I read an article a couple of day ago saying that the two other main markets have already eclipsed Silk Road 2.0. 
It wasn't even the main market but they probably wanted to send a message, to prove that they can keep down "Silk Road".

He only tipped the waitress 100 satoshis/milliliter so it took 6 hours to deliver the beer.

So in short they are respectively, pretty, pretty, pretty good.

Don't worry for him. He is going to wait for everyone to deliver their comments then announce that he decided to not pay them as initially agreed. That's the real

If I had followed this advice a couple of years go with my 10 bitcoins I purchased at $15 each, I would now be around 7K richer :/

I remember when they were $20 around 2010 and a dude said he just bought $20 000 because he expected them to at least reach $100 per bitcoin. I though he was a bit optimistic and when they dropped to $5 I really, really hope he didn't sale.

They should mod their SETI distributed software so you can allocate a percentage of your PC resources to mine bitcoins for them. I heard many times that they have too much computing power and never enough cash. This should be  the perfect solution.

Don't know his goals but I keep procrastinating just to call the towing company to get rid of my old car for months. 
He got rid of his old car by creating a rocket company that threw it in orbit around the sun.

And the reporter was doing that interview thing where he ask the question in different ways with a calm emphatic motherly voice and a pause, that usually end up bringing some tears.

And if he has more than $500, ahead of 63% of all the population.
With $1 he is ahead of 33%.

When you are young it's the best time to take a risk and his life saving are probably not 30 years of life savings. Usually people who start their first time job do not save nor invest anything so OP is doing pretty well. I say the time to invest in crypto is now not in 10 years.

Bittrex blocked deposits and withdrawals in USDT since last week.

Maybe you can ask the seller if he do refunds? Of course you will pay the 3 million dollars restocking fee.
