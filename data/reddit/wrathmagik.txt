Hey. No just bitcoin. 
Other crypto like monero are literally untraceable. But with bitcoin, it was designed to be transparent.
That and because bitcoin has massive scaling issues and the lighting network isn't even a good solution, it's actually quite bad if you read into it. 
The thing is, if all countries ban a very traceable crypto, and no-one accepts it anymore because of this, it's worthless.
It's like trying to give someone a seashell instead of a dollar.

FUD= fear uncertainty doubt
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:41:45
Because he's not bright enough to realize every rise in other coins permanently devalues bitcoin.

Most people in the bitcoin Reddit are idiots just like that bird and why so many people hate them and will laugh when they fall.
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:02:03
Never.

Laughing at all the HODLers ��

What you think he's captain planet now? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:39:10
I believe it's real.
There's far dumber people out there. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:20:19
Crypto is being rapidly legislated and taxed all over the world. The only value it had was tax evasion and anonymity, and those are history. On top of that bitcoin is being accepted less not more all over the world. Your holding onto an asset that's value is plummeting. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:32:23
Buy in the dip and be another broke HODLer everyone laughs at ��
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:25:07
Another dumb HODLer

@_date: 2018-01-12 09:07:24
Meanwhile in the real world BTC is worth 13k and dropping. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:26:15
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:56:25
Because people are greedy and care about money before all else.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:34:36
Not listening to someone obviously smarter than you is the definition of stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:10:04
It definitely still has room to grow, no debate there. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:11:09
It's because of bitcoin cash and Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:24
No but you can be hacked.
Sleep tight ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:35:51
Whether it's a good choice or not isn't the point.
The point is yes they can ban a technology. Easily. Will it stop it completely? No. But it will cripple it badly enough that it's under control again.
Watch what's happening to VPN's and regulations on cryptocurrency right now.
Coinbase just lost a ruling and are now handing over details of their customers to the IRS. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:45:43
If your friend isn't brain dead he'll quickly realize cutting out 99% of all customers that want to pay with really money isn't his most brilliant idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:43:16
AAAAAAND YOUR WRONG
It's barely at 13k and dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:25:23
In theory yes, but it'll never happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:27:02
Satoshi never wanted recognition or fame.
Also considering we don't know who he/she/they are it would be impossible anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:00:40
Some Governments have already named uber.

Wow, info wars was actually ENJOYABLE and TOLERABLE without that idiot Alex Jones.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:08:38
The ads are linked to your account, not your internet connection.
VPN's won't do a thing. They still see what your doing on your account. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:53:13
Once they ban uber they set a precedence in law, so another uber won't show up.
So yes it will put a stop to it.
@_date: 2015-12-10 05:08:52
After the next global financial crash we'll see the real value and potential of Bitcoin/crypto currencies.
Especially in poor countries where bitcoin is worth more than there native currency.
@_date: 2015-12-10 09:21:54
There's a new article out now showing the hacker was a disgruntled Wright employee who thinks he's a total asshole and that's why he doxxed him.
People in denial are acting like kids that met there favorite band backstage and couldn't accept who they really were.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:17:10
Sounds to me like money meant more to your brother then family.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:34:04
That's not the bottom. The price is definitely down further once BCH comes back.
It's equity. BCH will enter listings and BTC will go down to compensate in the market. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 12:28:41
Seems less likely the hacker is scamming. He didn't even ask for money for the info.
Wright may not be Satoshi but the evidence keeps piling up and pointing that way.
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:25:11
You need to stop watching x-files reruns.

Bitcoin can't even hit 10k �� 
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:28:13
I'd be embarrassed that BTC can't break 10k anymore.

Oh ok. I think they only accept credit cards. You can get a load as you go one from your bank easily enough. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:01:57
Yes you can.
Get an app for Coinbase on your phone and your set to go.

This isn't a dip. BTC has been in that dumpster awhile. It's not going anywhere.

It would, but they won't. They'll just make there own currency like Fedcoin so they can control it.

HAHAHA YOU FOOL LOL

If you actually had a functioning brain the question you would be asking is, if they were capable of that back then, imagine what they're capable of now.

Really? I never heard of Satoshi being hacked?
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:15:51
I beg to differ. History has proven time and time again that males accept technology much faster than women before it is taken up by women to go mainstream when it's more user friendly and streamlined.
Here's a few examples that were heavily male dominated before more user friendly versions showed up.
BitTorrent 
iRC 
online gaming 
etc etc etc
And now bitcoin and crypto
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:09:56
Bitcoin is being banned and regulated at a record pace, it's not coming back.

@_date: 2018-02-05 05:28:20
From what I saw it had already gone below 8k but might've been wrong. The real damage is going to be when tether is audited and if it's a scam like everyone including the U.S. Government thinks, the price of BTC is going to crash hard. Very hard. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:39:12
HODOR !!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:25:06

@_date: 2018-02-07 22:45:07
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:03:45
I'm going to get down voted for this or yelled at but the truth is bitcoin will never see mainstream adoption until women use it to.
Women aren't stupid, but most by nature do not give a rats ass about technology, they just want it to be convenient and user friendly.
Until that happens bitcoin is not going anywhere. It will remain on the fringes. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:21:17
Can I borrow your crystal ball your HODLing? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:21:56

@_date: 2018-02-07 20:15:38
I'm sure you think you're quite clever with your preaching and low brow insults but honestly your not intelligent to pull it off. I do find it highly amusing though so by all means ��
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:14:18
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:26:13
No I agree, women can be just as passionate about bitcoin as men. That being said 99% of women only use things when they are user friendly. 
When bitcoin wallets become as easy to use as say Apple pay, THEN you'll see bitcoin adopted en masse by women and it'll take off overnight. 
Until then, it'll remain a male dominated fringe tech I think. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:15:37
HODOR!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:20:01
