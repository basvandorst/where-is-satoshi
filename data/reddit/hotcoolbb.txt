As soon as a major internet superpower such as Google, Apple, or Amazon join in on the bitcoin bandwagon. When that happens, people will come from all angles to get involved with bitcoin.

Just keeping back here, obviously someone a hoard of other users are constantly checking to see if they can be the first to post the news here. Finding the news somewhere else will save you about 10 seconds max
