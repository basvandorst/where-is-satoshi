Yep. never sell my friends. I was trying to manage the ups and downs back when it was sub 1k. Was doing quite well making marginal gain. Then all of a sudden  I sold at 700 and it kept going up and up and up... bought back at 7k... The marginal gain is not worth it compare to the long haul

This is so relatable I went to a bitcoin seminar by someone who claimed to be a bitcoin guru and has been involved with crypto since 2007. I asked him about bitcoin, ripple and ether, what he's invested etc. Turns out he's never invested in crypto, merely studied it. Then I looked him up on LinkedIn, was in marketing for 10 years and got laid off

It was just an event a company organised. I don't work there and he didn't work at that company neither.

I went to a Blockchain event last year and the event introduced this guy as a Blockchain expert with over 10 years experience working in the field. He didn't talk about anything that isnt already common knowledge to people who are already familiar with Blockchain. He then finished the event by saying "I think coinbase is due a heck this year because of xxx reasons...". This grabbed my interest and I wanted to speak with him more about this. When I finally had a chance to speak with him in person, it turns out he has never actually bought any bitcoins before in his life and has only ever read "articles" on bitcoin and other altcoins.
I then found him on linkedin and he's been unemployed for 4 years. But listed himself as "Blockchain specialists" and founder of his own company. The company itself isn't actually a registered business, doesn't have a website or anything, just a Facebook page.

I know it's all about cutting out middle man but sometimes it's good to have a middleman. I.e. situations like this but if you didn't give it back

It's pointless explaining it to half the people on this sub. Bitcoin is no where near stable enough to be used as a currency in my opinion. However, I do have 2 questions on people's behaviour on this sub:
1. Bitcoin in my opinion is something that is worth investing in. Ultimately, Why spend something that is now with $900 when it's value fluctuate and experts are predicting it could potentially be worth $10000, if not millions?
2. People are so concerned about giving details to these "cooperate organisation", but honestly, how does it affect you? They protect your money from fraud and hackers at a very minimum cost... If any. And if you have nothing to hide why does it matter if you provide your details to them?

None of the other "took off" tech has a flat line
