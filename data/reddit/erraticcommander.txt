Too bad you didn't think about doing this in 2016.   
It's official, you missed the chance.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:36:06
It was all kind of bullshit to begin with, and when the price to dive in got prohibitively expensive, the jig was up.
Last year was driven by speculation/greed, NOT technology.  
I think it's going to slowly go down and stay down for the long haul.   The tech will be awesome to watch.  The price?  There's just zero need for the price to go crazy.   People just wished it was going to because it was fun and in many cases, enriching.

The reason no one is showing any respect to your posting  is because your statements lean towards the hyperbolic and are kind of a shade of egotistical.   Perhaps you are right in some respects, but generally speaking...no one likes to be lectured to.   
I'll accept that you believed you were starting a discussion.   But most people saw it as a monologue with very little nuance.   Clearly you are passionate.   But perhaps you'd have created more interest if it was posed as a series of questions.
p.s. "I was right" is typically a bad way to begin anything unless you want to be seen as martin shkreli jr.

You do understand though that in every single one of these examples, there was not a single currency.  There were other places outside of those empires which had currencies which also flowed into these empires and were part of a much larger system of barter and trade.

Life and markets are unpredictable.   If you take out a loan with the expectation of paying the loan down with BTC profits...that's pretty risky.   Even if all goes swimmingly with BTC...Trump could preemptively attack NK...who knows...
That's why the conventional wisdom is...don't risk what you can't afford to lose IMMEDIATELY.   
Nothing says you would not be taking out loan, paying interest on loan, buying at all time high, then market crash, loan payments due, etc etc.

Anonymous strangers, check.   Broad, information-less financial question, check.   Advice?  Sure!    Listen, what you should do with that $10-$25 is invest in a hose and begin to syphon gas from gas tanks and store the gasoline somewhere safe.   Eventually, the price of gasoline is going to skyrocket and then it's going to be like gold.  Or BTC.   Or some random shitcoin.    Gas.   Go with gas.

I LOVE the concept of Cointracking.info, but for some reason, it's always getting my Bitstamp info wrong.   I've tried importing lots of different ways.   Customer service responds to emails (takes a few days) but can't solve.    So I asked for a refund.    Other exchanges have been perfect.   So it's a bummer I can't get it to work right.
But it's overall very robust and great for taxes.

The idea being, sell what gets you to break-even and keep the balance in BTC as playing with the house's money.   
Then, in the event the market were to totally collapse, you'd have cash reserve sitting to slowly buy up again.
"Re-investing" not necessarily being the strategy, but being just a potential path depending on market.

Unlikely you'll get caught but if you do, the penalties are harsh.  You'll lose $4,000 and a lot more.

not really straight down.   clinging to ~$8,500
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:57:24
Was that you just now at $8485?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:05:16
It's falling from the trees right now.  Put your hand out and one will just fall into it.

Take your witchcraft elsewhere, idiot!

Then people will ride the upswing to a peak and then it'll crash again until another super powerful person/family comes in and puts all their money into BTC...
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:27:50
That part of your mind that is alarmed at your indifference...needs to speak a little louder.  :}
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:35:54
Buy at 8K, sell at 9K, buy at 8K, sell at 9K...do that 3 times a week and it's 3K gross which you can apply towards more BTC when it drops to 7K then buy at 8K and so on and so on.    If you're doing this with lots of BTC even more $$$
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:04:20
Well, they cashed out.   And they will buy at 2K.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:07:50
Sold when it was still in the 5 digit realm.  Will buy back when price is between 4K - 6K.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:19:52
This kind of question...is why BTC is in the state its in.    People just throwing out prices and names of companies, etc.    Like how Hollywood decides to make movies "what about King Kong meets Jaws" or "Speed Racer meets The Excorcist".    
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:40:26
Yes, I am thanking him for bringing more people into it.    I am encouraging him to do it.   Also get THEIR friends too.   Recommend they buy ASAP.  The dead cat bounce is not going to last forever.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:46:13
Ask him to hurry up.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:58:01
I think the psychology that pushed this unreasonable to $19,000 will push this unreasonably to $5,000.     That's just my personal sense of euphoria and greed vs fear and what I will now call FOMO(on holding too long). 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:51:36
Sell and buy back when it's $100 next week.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:06:41
Sell some BTC, hold fiat while everything craters.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:37:24
Probably prefer government to Roger Ver
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:04:53
You MIGHT consider selling a little bit at a time, just to split the difference.   IF the downward spiral continues, you'll have cash on hand to buy really low.   Or just hold the cash.

Aliens giveth, Aliens taketh away
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:00:31
Greed and euphoria pushed it unrealistically one direct.   Fear is now pushing it in the other direction.   
I sold 100% of my cyrpto this week with the guess that there's a couple more crushing downturns to come, and I'll just make it on the way back up...there might be others who are doing the same.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:44:13
Well, it was not based on actual fundamentals.   It was based on fear of missing out.   Now, the fear is missing getting out before the real crash begins.    
It's not a loss of interest, it's a gain of clarity.   :}
Perhaps the smart money is selling, then buying at the ATL.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:02:53
It's the FOMO on the real crash coming.   A lot of people were are probably wishing they sold at $10,000 and then again at $9,000.     It's coasting to $8,500 and that $8,600 comes back again and looks real safe time to eject.   
Remember, a lot of people bought BTC using credit cards and their 30 days are coming up.   Or whatnot.
