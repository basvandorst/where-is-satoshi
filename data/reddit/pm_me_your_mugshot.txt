If you pull out a loan for $1000 and the interest rate is 2% and the inflation rate is 2% then your effective interest rate would be 2% -2% = 0% so your basically getting the money for free. 
If a country gets a loan or bond for $100,000,000 to pay for war and the interest rate is 2% they can inflate their own currency to a rate of say 5% then they end up paying less then $100,000,000 in the end because it's effective interest rate is 2% -5% = -3%.
The debt basically depreciates in value.
I hope that explains the benefit of inflation to a government.

This is adjusted for inflation so OP was right in saying that your wage tends to keep up with inflation.

Why are you here if you think it's a scam?

You are correct. I wasn't clear enough.

At least the kids are trying. They may be naive but it's better than blowing it on eating out or useless bullshit.

It's a joke non the less. Are we over analyzing this thing?

I'm curious how Bitcoin will replace banks. I feel like at most Bitcoin substitute real money, right? Like how would I finance my home or buy a car?  It would be in Bitcoin. The ramification of Bitcoin on economic systems is mind boggling to me. I definitely don't understand. I Kno then when I get a loan from the bank only 10% of what I took out was physical cash the rest is just a number.  But how would that work with Bitcoin or would it be a completely new system.
TL:DR: idk what the heck I'm talking about
