I thought the sell-off was due to people withdrawing fiat to buy corn for Altagracia Day in the Dominican Republic...

Perhaps, but then other steps of association would be taken and the levels of association would compete on and on...BUT the market would only bear so much.  It's not that much different than today.  
Also, there is nothing saying that you couldn't have a private trademark "law" through a private, agreed-upon court system as well.  Sure, multiple court systems could compete...but again, the market will only bear so much.  The situation would stabilize eventually.

Trademarks can be issued by a private collective by contract exclusivity.  In other words, "We're the real Subway as certified by JD Power" (both private).

Is this supposed to be an insult?

This is awesome.  I was checking the sound settings like "Wait, did this scene actually happen?"

agreed.  Been using Opera since 2000.  the chromium thing was a let down for sure.  I miss the email...they were so far ahead of their time for so long...tabbed browsing, mouse motion commands, download managers...they even integrated bittorrent into their browser.

Been an Opera user since 2000, this is splendid!

Theoretically, if I bought $1000 worth of bitcoin in September, and it went up, I'd pay him _less_ bitcoin in October to equal $1000.  I'd hodl the difference for myself.  
Of course if it went down, I'd be screwed.

His brother is a tech legend that helped develop ATM and Ethernet and was an exec at Cisco.  He probably sees some parallels.

it would have to be $1000 _worth of_ BTC every month, not a fixed amount of BTC, because you're absolutely right.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:32:58
only if I can predict the market _better than him_  ;)
of course, he's a stockbroker...
