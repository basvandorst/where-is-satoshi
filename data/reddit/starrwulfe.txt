This is great!

I was just asked by a friend of mine who runs an Airbnb type business here about accepting bitcoin. 

Will make it very easy to let travelers know we accept it. Also now I can get paid in it and be legit tax wise too. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:00:27
Once you exchange into Yen, yes.

Bitcoin is money here just like the money on a Suica pass or Edy e-money card in the Finance Ministry's view.

Just as you can't use anything but cash to pay residence taxes here (no credit or debit cards) the same goes for BTC

I was literally scolded to by a guy showing me the ropes at a meetup when I told him my "wallet" was at Gox. Told me what could possibly happen at any exchange or online wallet you don't have private keys to. 
I couldn't get home fast enough to make some paper wallets...

Then use LastPass to back up all your passwords (including your Authy master password unless you're good at remembering it)

So I've been trying to find some folks to trade my NT$ into BTC with but everyone seems scared due to the dip on Friday. 
I'm still kicking myself for not buying some coin before I moved from Japan 4 months ago-- Taiwan has very little in the way of a Bitcoin community it seems. 
I was one of the ones who helped convince the owner of The Pink Cow restaurant in Tokyo to accept Bitcoin last year. 
However Taiwanese are known for their entrepreneurial spirit, so maybe I'm just not doing it right.
(also my lack of Mandarin is probably the culprit.)

This problem might not be there or not a big deal in first world places but its definitely something that will work in third-world places. Also something that would work well traveling for real. I'm very interested because I go between five different countries all the time that have their own currency systems in place. This would be something not unlike the old travelers checks but with a twist. Again I would rather have something like this when traveling into some sketchy places or even just going for a night out on the town if the place takes bitcoins then have to break out my smartphone and risk it being stolen or misplaced or dropped

@_date: 2014-03-07 18:28:51
I'm dredging up [this idea from here]( because I think it could be something valid at the point-of-sale.
Here in Taiwan, *all* receipts are encoded with a serial number generated by the tax authority. This number is actually a small lottery that happens every month, and the winner can get some decent cash. But more than that, it's used to ensure that all businesses comply with the law of doing all business above the table and pay their taxes--being enforced by the customers! 
If you had a chance at winning US$50~100 every 2 months, you'd ask for your sales slip too.
Seeing this, and that other thread, I thought "that'd be cool if a bitcoin enabled POS/vending machine had the option to give out change for a purchase in the form of these types of receipts.
The BTC cash vouchers would basically be paper wallets pre-loaded with small amounts of BTC--less than USD $20 worth. Security wouldn't be an issue because:
* They could be time-bombed-- all loaded BTC would expire after 30 days and go back to the original buyer's wallet address.
* They'd have pre-generated BIP 38 passcoded private keys, so even these small amounts wouldn't be scan-jacked arbitrarily. If you notice in the picture, the printers automatically pre-cut the portion between the tax ticket and the actual receipt. The auto generated private key PIN would go on that part of the reciept that is kept. 
So here's my scenario for how this would work, and keep in mind, this is purely at the customer's discretion:
* Customer wants to by a Tall Derp Latte for mB 4.500.  
* DerpCafe's POS system is set up to give out "change" from BTC in the form of either fiat or paper vouchers. (not unlike using a ATM cash card at the store and adding $20 to the bill to save a trip to the ATM.)
* Customer wants the BTC cash voucher. He wants mB 20.000 worth. 
* DerpCafe's POS then shows a QR code for the total amount, and Customer scans it and sends BTC over.
* DerpCafe then takes the payment and prints out the receipt along with 4 BTC Cash vouchers worth mB 5.0 each.  (this could also be in denominations up to the customer/store.)
OK, so why would someone want this?
* Customer may want to buy other small goods at other places and this would negate needing to pull out a smartphone all the time.
* Easy way to give other people some BTC without worrying about needing a phone for both parties. Just write/say the PIN and hand it over.
* Easy way to give fiat to people too-- give a BTC cash voucher to your non-crypro-loving friend and they can still just hit a BATM or any store that deals with BTC cash and get fiat. Or just use it on a DerpLatte.
* If it catches on, it wouldn't get stolen as much. Again, passcoded privatekey plus memorized PIN. Lose wallet, and you're screwed. Lose these, and you get the money back in up to 30 days because it wasn't redeemed. 
* All the good things I like about BTC, but in paper form-- Universal acceptance worldwide, still portable, and now you don't need to worry about needing enough battery in your phone for that taxi home from the bar (and there *are* taxis that take crypto now!)
OK, so what happens when you use the BTC cash at another store but you still have some change due?
* Change can return back to your BTC cash voucher (just remember the printed amount is now reduced--like a giftcard though.)
* New BTC cash voucher can be printed with the change inside, with a new PIN for the private key.
* If bearer has a sending address on a smartphone or paper wallet, then change can be sent there instead.
* Or, plain ol' fiat given back instead (with all the associated fees maybe.)
Right... OK, but what happens if you end up with "dust Satoshis" that will never get transferred?
*  Well I'd hope that software would avoid this issue and just send the remaining BTC to the bearer at that threshold...
* When redeeming for fiat, it would go to the POS/BATM's account as part of fees. 
...just a lil idea I have-- 
Don't downvote without at least giving a GOOD reason why it can't work...remember, this would be an OPTION anyway--costs nothing either way.

Hmm. 
I see the parallels he makes with the first credit card companies and Bitcoin...but he's leaving out the obvious.
Even credit card companies had to run to states like Delaware and South Dakota where there are LESS regulations in order to work and proliferate.
Bitcoin is STATELESS, and it can never be controlled by a government in its current incarnation-- it's programmed that way. How do you regulate something that is totally decentralized?  
You can regulate the businesses that are using bitcoin in a location I guess, but like cash, I can always just go somewhere else 'off the radar' and do business. My prerogative.

Credit cards ARE accepted by most places you'd expect. Bigger hotels, stores, etc. 
But not like in the US where you can swipe it for a pack of gum and a cola.
Processing fees are normally 4~8% depending on what's being bought, what card is swiped, and what processor the merchant is using.
For that reason, only the big guys can afford to take credit cards. There are ways around this-- Most online business is done via bank transfers, COD via the delivery company/Japan Post, or via cash vouchers bought at the convenience store's kiosks.  These methods cost the merchant around 2~3% or a flat fee. 
Again folks, this is why I'm literally grinning at the possibilities once the infrastructure is in place. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:43:19
To me, it's no more complicated than swiping your ATM card at the supermarket checkout and asking for "$20 change" -- designed to save a trip to an ATM to get cash. This would serve the same purpose.

Hey, I'm the dude that made the video, 1 year in Taiwan, 13 in Japan.
You can say I have a good handle on what goes down here.
Cash is king in both places... Until you need to get stuff on the net or remit it (lots of workers from other parts of Asia here)
That's why BitoEx (and a few others) are going after conbini kiosks.
Consider how I use it.
I need to get NT$ into JP¥ so I can pay bills in Yokohama. Now I can waltz into that same FM in the video behind my office and get some BTC and then send it to my Japan exchange account that auto converts to JP yen and deposits into my JapanPost savings account.
Way quicker and cheaper than a traditional wire.
@_date: 2014-10-23 18:40:26
OMG, why do people never read the freaking article and only the headlines? It says "companies that are dealing and selling Bitcoin will do so liable to an 8% consumption tax." Every business in Japan is liable for that tax if they sell any kind of good or service BTW. 
If you read just below that line, it continues by saying, "private individuals trading Bitcoin won't be subject to any taxes whatsoever."
So basically Japan and their newly formed digital assets authority has a clear starting point for how any kind of cryptocurrency is to be treated and now the fun can begin out in the open. I fail to see why this is bad news. 
Personally I'm looking forward to the day I can recharge my JR Shiva Rail Pass with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:28:46
All banks in Asia use passbooks. I have accounts in Taiwan and Singapore in addition to Japan. Makes sense since there's no checking (cheques); everything is a furikomi bank transfer.

This wouldn't be as big a deal if I were still based in Tokyo-- plenty of BTC-nerds like me who are willing to exchange fiat in large amounts like that. (not to mention Gox during its better days)
...but I'm in Taipei mostly and I've only managed to find 3 people here that'll change fiat/BTC for me and it really depends on whether they feel like hoarding or dumping... Even had a trade go south on Local Bitcoins halfway b/c the guy got cold feet about parting with his coins. 
There is no local exchange like BTC-stamp or even cryptsy. BTQuick.tw and LocalBitcoins.com is all right now, and I've only managed to chase down three trades in 4 months for about $60~70 US each. 
Plus that whole "we don't want BTC ATMs here" thing said by the Taiwan Money Authority isn't helping. Be easier for me to hop a plane every month and go to Hong Kong for a day and do exchanges there at this point.

What makes you guys think that the only people that would be working on Gox's problems would be in Tokyo? Is the internet and there's VPN.

So don't pay folks from the wallet the exchange uses. Transfer it to another one then send from that one. Better yet, use a tumbler or send to coinbase, then send out using that...

@_date: 2014-02-14 14:08:31
This is personally affecting me, since I have used Mt Gox since 2011 to buy coins in Japan where I live.
They're the only BTC entity that will take an in-country Japanese bank transfer and turn it into coins. So of course it was very convenient for me to take some of my salary, convert to BTC, and send it off to Coinbase, and turn it into US$ where I could pay my student loans, and also help out my family from time to time. 
I used to keep most of my coin in the online wallet they provide, but that one scare at inputs.io had me heading for the paper wallet and Multibit side of the room with the quickness. 
Since then, I just used Mt Gox (and for that matter Coinbase too) as pure clearinghouses and exchanges. As soon as my buy clears, I immediately move all of it into a wallet *I* have a private key for, until I'm ready to do something with it. 
So while I don't have the misfortune of having BTC trapped in MtGox-land, I also am sitting here looking at my monthly money transfer fees go from 1-2% via the system I just outlined, to using traditional banks and something around 20% when the vultures get through taking their cuts...

Long term resident of Japan here. 
As long as they make it easy for me to move Japanese yen into and out of the exchange easily using an online solution as opposed to having to go to the ATM to do it every time, I'm all for it.
Mt Gox sucked because they didn't make any attempt to try to connect with the local people living here and it was actually a lot easier for person to wire money internationally then to use a local bank to put money into the exchange!

Thanx for that.  Also the very fact that you can be in the middle of nowhere, Japan and still be within a 10 minute drive of a 7-11 is a fact. You can also stand on a corner in many big cities and have a 7-11 on all 4 corners.

Dear Japan and Taiwan, 
This is how it's done. 
Now tell Hitachi and Asus to hook it up plz k'bai 
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:37:53
I've lived in Japan for 13 years on and off. Currently living in Taipei for work, but I go back "home" to Yokohama ever other month. 
As I've said in other forums, I have used Mt Gox to simply go from yen to us$ so I can remit money to the States. But over the past 3 months, bitcoin has been in the financial news and information is finally being filtered into mainstream Japanese society. 
Japanese are actually able to get the concept of crypto currency quicker than any other country in the West because we use it in the form of transit passes and e-money cards already (Google search Rakuten Edy, Suica).  All convenience stores, most vending machines, and tons of other businesses accept these as payment instruments. There are even USB readers you can buy for your PC that will let Japanese websites accept your e-money Cards. In fact, they're built-in to most laptops sold here. 
All cellphones (even regular flip phones) have the e-money chips and apps in them (Google Felicia) and remember the QR code is a Japanese invention too. 
In short, everytime I talk to a Japanese about bitcoin, I always have a comparison to something already here that they know and use everyday. 
They already change from yen into the e-money via bank connected app on their phone, kiosk/ticket vending machine at a train station or in cash at a 7-11. 
They already know that if they lose the card/phone/payment instrument, that e-money, like cash, is gone (However you can register your transit passes at a train station and recover the balance for a small fee) 
They don't mind the extra steps of putting their phone on the NFC reader to pay for things. 
As my good friend that runs The Pink Cow restaurant in Tokyo can tell you, bitcoin has put her business on the map because now local Japanese (and not just us expats) are stopping by to see BTC at work. 
Finally, you can't call Mtgox a 100% homegrown Japanese exchange. The executives are all foreign and really never went out to get local business.  But you better believe real Japanese companies like Rakuten and SoftBank Yahoo ARE looking hard at BTC and leaning on the government to look the other way for a bit so they can see about the potential. 
Disclosure : I have lived in Japan on and off since 2000 and started tinkering with bitcoin ever since PayPal froze my account while I was collecting donations for our major earthquake in 2011. Once I realized how much cheaper it was to remit money back to the US using bitcoin, I was hooked in 2012. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:54:48
Oh? OK, now reverse it.  Think of all the expats that remit their money back to their own countries that live in your area. I had a friend just 2 weeks ago get 3 people in his family use a wild combination of those Mastercard gift cards you can get at supermarkets and then some remittance service that allows funding from debit cards into a mobile GIRO service that the mobile phone company where his family is from has.
His family over there keeps cash and the banks charge crazy fees for wires.  
I explained what I do with BTC to remit my money home and he was on localbitcoins.com half the night looking for someone to buy coin in 'the old country'. The amount of time  saved alone by them would be be with it, in addition to the fees becoming virtually zero... 
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:24:11
TIL… 
I don't know of any place in the states where they aren't taxed. 
Unless you're on EBT or WIC, in which case you get a debit card that takes taxes off at POS
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:10:16
Yes--it simply means now bitcoin is a product, the same as a giftcard would be. 
In every convenience store in Japan, you can buy iTunes, Google Play, and Nintendo giftcards. for every Y100 you pay, you add in an extra 5 (or 8 now?) yen to account for the national consumption tax. 
So if I set up a BVM or bitcoin exchange, I'd have to charge that consumption tax as part of the fee structure for vending BTC.
This is in addition to my percentage spread that I'm claiming as profit. (which I'll get taxed for as income maybe...not sure about that part.)
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:11:17
That's right (Don't downvote him guys, he's the CEO of the company powering the whole deal.)
(I'm not sure how to change my title here but it should say 2980 stores, not 7000.)

Let's also remember the random person (like me) who live in other countries and while traveling, are trying to avoid fiat exchange rates as well. 
It's a constant pain to remember what place is better for using an ATM to get local currency vs those TravelEx booths in the airports vs a local bank vs just putting it on plastic.
At least with the Robocoin, I know what I'm getting...and that's only if I don't find someplace else to pay directly in coins, or do a person-person trade.
@_date: 2014-10-05 07:53:13

I am planning on returning to Japan fulltime after my stint in Taiwan is over anyway, but this would certainly speed things up for me.
The only thing holding back Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency really) is the government's lack of understanding about it. Once understood, then they can proceed to figure out how THEY can make money off of it...and we all know once that happens, to the moon we go! (for a parallel, look at Washington and Colorado in the US where personal use of marijuana is legal simply because they figured out a decent taxing scheme. Or even my home state of Missouri, which banned any form of gambling for eons, but starting in the late 1980's there's a huge state lottery, and in the 90's, riverboat casinos, and now freestanding casinos.)
Japan is a country where business is dominated by massive companies with an oligarchical past (財閥会社 zaibatsu companies) that are into every vertical market imaginable. e.g. Sony, which you know for electronics, but they're also a major insurance company. Mitsubishi which makes cars, pencils, and robots, but also is a huge banking conglomerate. Toyota is too. 
All it takes is for one of these companies to decide to adopt bitcoin somehow over here--and then just go and grab your popcorn and beer.
Imagine if Rakuten (one of the world's largest online retailers like Amazon, but based in Tokyo) accepted Bitcoin like Overstock.com...now remember that they also own [EDY]( which is "digital money" in the form of a NFC chipped card or smartphone. The group also owns eBank/Rakuten Bank as well, which is Japan's first branchless bank-- everything is done via internet and through partner ATMs. 
Now imagine Ito-en corp taking BTC. They own Seven-Eleven company. Just in Japan alone, there are more Seven-Eleven stores than in the US. Inside every one of them is one or two Seven Bank ATMs... Yes, in Japan, Seven Eleven also runs their own BANK and finance corporation... Now imagine what would happen if they started allowing bitcoin transactions on those ATMs. In those stores on goods and services. Paid all their employees even in a percentage of BTC... 
And I for one think *it could actually happen* because it's happened before with the fact that foreign issued debit cards were not accepted in ATMs except at Citibank before 2009~10. Then SevenBank started accepting them nationwide. They have 17,000 ATMs all over Japan. Suddenly other banks started accepting them because they saw the money they could be making in the proposition. 
All it took was one...And that's all it'll take here too.
Will it happen overnight--no. But if the government, banking industry, and tech sector really sat down to study it and propose secondary systems around the protocol, Japan would be the first country to support cryptocurrencies. 
Even if they said "We can't support bitcoin, but we've improved upon it and created 'YenCoin'", then that almost would be better in a sense--they would have in effect created the first state-sponsored cryptocurrency.

I have a day job, but have been known to write, shoot photos and videos, and edit all the above for bitcoin/litecoin as a freelancer.
If I could ever convince my main job to just pay me in BTC, (at least a percentage) I'd do it immediately. Would make remitting my money back home easier because I live overseas at the moment.

I would've tried my best to help except, Gox made us Japanese residents go through the same AML/KYL stuff here for our Japanese accounts.

Here's my moronic question... How did you do it, so I can do it too? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:54:18
That was the best part-- in the beginning before the hiccups, it only took maybe a day or so. 
Transactions into Japanese banks were done manually once or twice a day, meaning someone walked to the bank with a printout of amounts and accounts to pay into. The bank would hand them over a list of accounts that payed into their bank that would then get credited in MtGox's system. 
How do I know this? Because this is pretty much how most banking is done in Japan...no such things as checks or ACH--everything is a funds transfer, and when I was running a magazine, I would have to make the bank run from time to time to do the same thing.
Most of the time though, I was putting money in so I could get bitcoins. Then I'd send them back home to a few friends that wanted coins and didn't mind putting some money on my Paypal or just going to my credit union and dropping off checks. This was before Coinbase though. I never once used the wire service at MtGox, because I could just do that myself-- my goal was to cut the fees and time it took for my ¥ to turn into $, and not invest or hoard. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 04:13:05
Well if you meant to say how many non-Taiwanese people are here, not that many at all. (Some people equate English=not native when asking this question.)
If you meant general language skills, there are lots of Taiwanese who speak and read English well too. Considering the country is the size of Florida, with 20 million people, I'm often amazed at the number of people I meet here whose English is near a conversational level. 
Many Taiwanese study abroad or have lived overseas too.

In Taiwan every single receipt that is handed to you from a store a bar or anywhere has a unique identification code written on it. It is to ensure that they are participating in the sales tax scheme for the country. They must give a receipt to all customers no questions. That serial number also is it automatic entry into a countrywide lottery that happens every 2 months . This is so that the customers are also keeping up with their receipts and making sure that they get one. It's a very good system to keep down the rampant tax evasion merchants were doing before it was put in its place. What you have now is sometimes you'll see an old person outside the convenience store or a coffee shop that will collect the throwaway receipts so that they could get some money off the lottery! Kind of the same thing if you ask me.

I recommend attending a Bitcoin meetup near you if possible. You'll also find a lot of people willing to walk you through the possibilities, not to mention some people willing to trade fiat to BTC in person just to get you some coin to practice with.

I've seen a lot, that's for sure. But my experience isn't just Kanto. I actually lived in Kansai the longest, followed by Chubu (Nagoya). 


I see lots of plastic being pulled out these days.  Then again, if you're in the countryside then you'll see more cash because most of the shops out there don't have a need to deal with card fees and so on. 


Dude, where in Japan do you live? Everyone I've ever dealt with since 2000 has had basic access to a PC, even if it was at a net cafe. I've been to some really out the way places like Hida, Gifu, Tottori, and way over in Ehime... everyone had at least a laptop. But even beyond that, Japan is probably the most mobile connected country on the planet. Most folks here use their phones to get online anyway. Bitcoin can handle that, and that's actually a point I didn't make in that thread. 


Hmm... Maybe you're taking my analogy too literal. When I said what I said, I also said "I have paradigms I can use to *explain* the concept of Bitcoin in *tangibles* Japanese people can understand." And contrary to your statement, if I lose my Edy card or Pasmo card--I'm just as screwed as if I lost the private key to my bitcoin wallet. No one is gonna check to see who just bought a chu-hai or took the Tokaido line with my card. That's something they understand. Also remember, Japan is an island, so the galapagos effect is rampant. 


Switch banks man.   I've been a customer since 2007, and I don't get why folks still stay where they are really. 


They got the hang of Twitter quicker than Westerners did... They got the hang of Facebook too... Then they said "let's make something that does both." Hello LINE.  The trick is, you have to give it to them in a way to "Japanasize" it. You ought to know what I mean by that. It's the same way Toyota/Honda cars and Panasonic/Sony Electronics kicked ass. Let *them* find a way to integrate the protocol into their lives *their* way--and I'll bet it'll be something we *all* like.
That's why I'm so pissed at MtGox. They never did try to market to the people literally in their own backyard. And I know because I was there asking them these same questions for the last 3 years. 


That has more to do with their archaic telecommunication laws and what can/can't be a legal document, than anything. But even that's changed. Tell those nut jobs they can accept PDFs now (I had this same issue at my ward office 3 years ago.)

Well up up until recently, I used Mt Gox.... Since it ties to my Japanese bank account and wire fees in country are pretty low.
But now I just use trusted local bitcoin trades. The Tokyo bitcoin meetup guys are really helpful for this sort of stuff. Taiwan is a different story... The money authority basically echoed what mainland China said, and screwed up some plans for robocoin to come in with an ATM... And no exchange can tie to a bank to do fiat trades here either. So its all been P2P with localbitcoins.com and BitQuick.tw folks.  
I really want to start a business or join people that are interested in bring BTC (and LTC and even DOGE for that matter) to Taiwan somehow... And also get regular Japanese people interested in the possibilities of cryptocurrencies to help their business if possible.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:01:44
Damn the trolls have nothing better to do on a Sunday it seems...
My world would drastically change for the good if Bitcoin/Some Other P2PCryptoCurrency (P2PCC) was allowed to take hold.
I travel throughout Asia for work. I'd never visit the moneybookers desk at the airports ever again.
I'd seek out and only patronize those businesses that dealt in P2PCC to save us both money, reward them for making a consumer-driven decision, and expand the P2PCC economy. (I do this now when possible, but would actively do it more if the next statement were possible.)
I'd demand my pay would be in P2PCC. Then I'd never even need an online exchange very often either (MtGox-like foolishness wouldn't exist for me...not that it did in the first place; Just like I wouldn't leave my wallet at a physical exchange, I never leave coins at the virtual ones.)
Banks for P2PCC can exist, merely to serve as interest bearing places to securely store your coins, with an insurance against fraud and theft. They'd need no physical branch really, but could set up "stores". Check out CoinKite and Neo&amp;Bee... They are the forerunners of this new-school cryptobank.
Exchanges as we know them would be relegated to CCVMs, CryptoCurrency Vending Machines. Enough of this "wiring some company based in Far Far Away to get fiat into P2PCC and out again." Enough of needing to trust a process set up by God-Knows-Who to take said wire transfer and manually put it into BTC/LTC/Whatever based on a number given in the memo line of the wire receipt. And screw those "wait 5 days because you're a newbie customer" timelines. Robocoin, Lamassu, CoinKite, et al are doing it right.

...hey I'm also a reporter, and I think I met you at the Tokyo BTC Meetup at the Pink Cow in October of last year. 
All I know is they had the nuttiest standards for doing business ever. They shut my account down twice in 2 years for "non-verification" even though I was a local client (live in Yokohama, about 20 minutes by train from their office.) At the time, local customers didn't need to be verified; having a local bank account was proof enough.
The last time they did it, I went to their office and was turned away because it's not a "place meant for those kinds of transactions." and was forced to do everything through the mail even though I was local."
**TL;DR** The only reason I still dealt with them is because they were the *only* exchange in Japan where I could do "furikomi" (domestic wire transfers) which are really cheap.

I have started writing the setup codes down manually where possible (some sites give this option in case your device has no camera to use a qr code). I then put the codes into LastPass as a secure note. (LastPass is a service that I highly recommend. Think blockchain.info but for passwords everthing is client side encrypted and can even be run offline on a thumb drive if you want).

I think for the sake of setting clear expectations to the already-sheepishly-skeptical general public, you'd better use that terminology whether you agree or not.
My 68 year old mom expects anything called 'ATM' to spit out $20 bills, not QR codes.
She however does expect things called 'vending machines' to spit out other items, including things that are worth ActualMoney like winning lotto scratchers and giftcards to Applebees. IJS.
If her son sent Bitcoin to her and she needed to change it out for fiat and hears about a Bitcoin ATM on the news, she'd roll out to wherever it was installed...but if she finds that it's really just an *entry point* from fiat to BTC, and not the other way round, I'm the one that'll hear about it!
And I for one as a damn-near-native Atlantan will pray to Bitcoin-God that your business plans take off. In fact if you need help with writing up press releases and any PR/logistics support, I'll do it for coins.
Next time I'm back, I wanna pay for wings at Taco Mac with BTC.

As my income is paid in Taiwan, I usually have no need to cash out here-- I cash out elsewhere because I use BTC as a vehicle to remit my $ and nothing more. 
However I have been known to visit coinmap.com and hit some of the merchants there, like the Italian place in the center of town on Dunhua for example.

I made the vid. 
Since October when I shot this, I've used it about 4 times to remit BTC back home to the States and also to Japan where 'home base' is for me. 
Works better than the stodgy traditional way, thats for sure. 
Still hunting for a way to get BTC into fiat, but there's hope around here with small merchants that they will just accept BTC directly.

Slowly but surely, Japan is getting consumers interested in BTC. There's a currency exchange in Nakano Broadway here in Tokyo that also does BTC-JPY exchanges for example.
Lots of people are paying with the transportation IC cards (Suica/Pasmo/Toica/Manaca) and the e-money cards (Edy/ID/QuikPay) so I expect something from these companies to break the wall at some point. 
17 years in Japan has taught me patience and astute observation is the key.

Thanx! Feel free to post it here. Anything that helps make it easier to understand how to do is fine by me and the rest of the community I'm sure

Or in other words, if you really thought bitcoin was "illegal" in Taiwan, think again. XBT still has the FinTech department's blessing, and major companies are still working on making sure they can accept it due to the large amounts of tourists and immigrant workers in Taiwan. Cross-border payments at the register is now a reality.
