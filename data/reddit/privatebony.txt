Their are some blockchain projects that are attempting to solve this problem. Alphabet(Google) has invested in one.

I'm not exactly sure how this specific project is tied with Bitcoin right now but it's backed by brain venture capital (Google) which makes it interesting. In the near future there could definitely be something like this implemented in Bitcoin. I know there are some other blockchain projects that are more centered around stabilizing Bitcoin but I haven't really done my research.

If you own 0.1 bitcoin and the price of bitcoin hit 10 million, you would be a millionaire.

I agree with you it would take a couple decades at least. You never know though by that time there might be a more dominant crypto.

Really interesting. I have a feeling starlink will be a huge player in satellite blockchain mining

The internet was incredibly slow in the early days. It took hours to do simple task like sending and receiving files.

Bitcoin is progressing by security, usage, and scaling solutions. Just because it has bottlenecks rn doesn't mean it's going to be like that forever. Developers all over the world are figuring this out. I never said it was easy but I don't think Bitcoin should be completely rulled out as a failed technology by your analysis.  
The internet was incredibly hindered by similar limitations. That is why it took decades for it to become what it is today.
