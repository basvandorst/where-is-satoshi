Blockchain.info is having issues. I just transfered some bitcoin 3 hours ago and it took me 15miin to have it transfer. Blockchain still says unconfirmed but in reality it already was. Check your wallet

Odd, My transaction was actually to binance and it went through without any issues. I don't think binanace is having any issues maybe it's BTC markets.

Yeah really disappointing since we've used them for years now. It's funny. They sent me a message almost instantly after opening this thread saying that its normal to have responses in an hour (never been the case for us or anyone else) and resolution in 1-2 days. Sadly though that isn't the case; actually their auto response to emails says you'll get your first response 1-2 business days later. It looks like bitpay is one of those companies that doesn't care about their customers until it actually affects them otherwise. Sad, I'm willing to bet that the lawsuit bitpay is going though on top of the lack of any support on their site are the reasons why they just aren't going to last very long.

For the others that also aren't getting support from BitPay here is the merchant link for coinbase: 
It looks like their merchant fees are only if you convert to currency like USD no matter the size. This is a step up from bitpay.

Not from what I can see. It looks like they are still pushing it on their site an I can't find any news articles or results that show they have announced something like that.

It looks like gocoin is just like bitpay but have a greater reach and probably better support. Find their site here:  Their fees are the same as bitcoin, but at least you'll get responses when there are issues.
