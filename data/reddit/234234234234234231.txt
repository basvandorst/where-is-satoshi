True but that is only in the long term. In the short term, investors can bid up the prices to abnormally high levels based on companies beating exceptions and what not.


I saw it in a documentary called, "money for nothing." That documentary quotes some pretty big name people saying that the fed creates booms and busts. 


No it is not. The problem is how much of this supposed economic growth is actually real and how much of it is just people reacting to low interest rates? You can already see cracks forming, the average mortgage rate goes up 1% from a year ago and suddenly home sales drop 5%? Then they say the average rate is going to continue to go up. That should mean less home sales. We all know home purchases are a huge consumer spending boost to the economy. [source](
so yeah, if you ask me, this economic recovery sure looks a lot like some smoke and mirrors game going on.

Isn't greenspance the same guy who said it is better that the dollar is not backed by gold?

I agree with you but it seems odd that it hasn't happened sooner. Even inflation is not out of control which is strange considering how long this QE/low interest rates has been going on.
We all know that the fed creates asset bubbles and it appears that the new bubble is in the stock market. If you ask me the fact that markets go up when the fed announces bad news is a clear sign that the markets are in a mania state and not thinking clear.
QE is going to be eliminated and eventually interest rates will go up, both are negatives for the market.

The green part will be 75%+ after you factor in all the chargebacks etc.

Seems more like 95% know nothing about it....

Totally agree. I view bitcoin as simply an innovation in terms of money systems. We need to keep innovating. The dollar, like the gold standard, is obsolete technology. Time to move.

80/20 rule (pareto principle) applies to many different statistical situations. Other notable distributions: top 20% of economies control 80% of GDP, 80% of sales come from 20% of products, 80% of injuries come from 20% of the hazards, 80% of healthcare usage comes from 20% of the patients, 80% of crimes are committed by 20% of the criminals etc.
