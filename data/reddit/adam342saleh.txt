Because right now btc is full of fees anyway everyone would be vulnerable 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:18:04
Like right now I was waiting for 1000 confirmations loll
I think like I need to read the original whitepaper.
I am like concerned because still managed to get some fork coins.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:17:26
Well otherwise noone would buy it

Bro can I add you to telegram chat and give you my handle I think we can both benefit from each others advise I mean I'm doing this 24/7 so we can help each other
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:20:49
Is that the only important thing?
Also is there a way to send btc fast like via sweeping rather than sending to hardware wallet 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:04:05
No because I had 3 wallets 1 online old and 1 online new.
I sent from old to new and now I have my hardware wallet in post today. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:49:14
No confirmations were to a normal wallet 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:05:04
Now I have  6 confirmations but is it safe to share old pvt key still I mean if it's taking this long to send and 60 $ fees I paid why not just sweep?
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:17:08
I don't think it's possible they can't hack btc
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:49:48
Im worried it needs all 20000 confirmations before I can share old key?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:02:11
Thanks bro have you started to get fork coins too? I mean I doubt most people are sending out of old wallets with more than 200 confirmations 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:14:46
Ok man like I can give you mine if your worried about security 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:33:53
Last question what is parallel transfer and am I safe to go get the forks coins now with the empty wallet pending all confirmations above 6
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:47:56
Like to you sir this is the answer I needed all week like like like,
But thing is people say if they are a miner they can still 51% attack 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:08:46
I mean the seed on hardware wallet is always pregenerated like it's the same but inside wallet instead of scratchcard
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:05:00
Which I'm thinking of using but after seeing that reddit post about 34k lost I don't think I'll be putting too much in and no my is direct from site

Please be honest
