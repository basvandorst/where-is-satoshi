Great thread, thanks for all the positivity ! :)
Just to clarify a few points, it cost us absolutely nothing to set up an account with Bitpay, and the fees for accepting a BTC payment are very small compared to accepting credit cards.
Our taxi company gets a lot of work via Online Bookings and payments from overseas customers requiring Airport pick ups when they arrive in the UK, paying with BTC is just another option for them (we also accept Paypal).
Training drivers takes all of 5 minutes for anyone who has / can use a Smartphone.
We are able to email a BTC invoice (with a QR code) directly to customers, most of our work is booked and paid for in advance.
We of course realise that Cumbria probably does not have that many Bitcoin users at the moment but we are ready and waiting for our 1st BTC paying customer whenever that may happen.
If anyone needs a taxi from Newcastle Airport to Carlisle or vice versa, we could do it for 1 BTC (at todays prices 1BTC = £86.) :-) 
Of course cash is more convenient in most cases and for shorter taxi journeys but the option is there whenever our customers require it (maybe they ran out of cash and/or lost their wallet).
If anyone would like to be our 1st BTC paying customer then please get in touch, we are based in Carlisle in Cumbria and our website is
