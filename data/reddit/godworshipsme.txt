No it’s not. It’s value is the result of people trying to get rich quick

I personally would tell the hospital to fuck off and not pay them

It’s useful on dark net markets. That’s the only thing I’ve ever used it for

What's a kyc?

How would somebody magically know who is behind the owner of the account? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:53:25
What's wrong with that?

Half a bitcoin lol.

That's why bitcoin won't go big anytime soon

You can't argue with these idiots. They're the type to buy at $4000 and when the price is at $1000 and dropping they'd say "hodl" instead of selling while the price is dropping and buying more at a cheaper price.

Already did after buying at $350. It really serves no good purpose that real money can't outside of using the dark net. Lol. I just got lucky that I happened to have a lot right before this bubble started

I'm not saying bitcoin isn't a thing or it doesn't have a purpose. I'm saying that with most things you can do with bitcoin you'd be better off doing it with real money. Bitcoin's best purpose is buying things off of the dark net.

But you lose REAL money when you buy bitcoin or make a purchase because of the fees. There really isn't anything that makes spending bitcoin better than spending money.

When I sold at $4500 on coinbase this past week it was way more than 10 cents. Where are you getting fees that low?
