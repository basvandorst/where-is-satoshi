Bitcoin is not a Ponzi or Pyramid scheme. Even the last person on earth to adopt Bitcoin would be able to make a FAIR trade for his belongings / workforce for Satoshis (no one would accept fiat at this point). 
Edit: And the fact that early adopters are richer than others is wrong. They simply went from an inflationary Currency to a deflationary Currency. So they didnt get richer, the others simply got poor because their money hyperinflated.

You just explained why BTC is way better then Paypal / Credit Cards. Just because you never see the lost money on your Paypal / CC transactions doesnt mean they dont happen. So far you paid way more then 17 $ in hidden transaction costs. But not only do you pay in cases the merchant doesnt deliver, you also pay if buyers do chargebacks even though they got their goods. With BTC u finally create an incentive to sue criminal activities and reduce the amount of them. Additionaly i can save money by choosing trustworthy merchants.

The way i see it, is to use Bitcoin as a global "local" currency

I want to see James Bond fighting the [Random Villain] who switched from dollars to bitcoins for their illegal Business. He steals their private key and buys himself a Tesla.

To visualise this let's assume the world consists of 3 people, each owning 1/3 of the money supply. Person 3 produces chairs, so far he produced 2 chairs. They cost 1/2 the money supply. Now he builds a third one and the price drops to 1/3. So suddenly the other guys are richer and can buy a chair with their money. But as you can see, they didn't steal something from the third person (in fact even his 1/3rd of money increased in value). The increase of purchasing power was simply integrated "fair" in the money supply. Today that increase in purchasing power is simply stolen by governments.

So does that mean, if you get payed in bitcoin in Australia, you dont have to pay income tax? Because clearly, you simply traded your workforce for some bitcoins. 10% would be a joke against the income tax.
The only point they made was concerning the miners:
