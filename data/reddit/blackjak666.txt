they were nice bibles too, navy blue, leather bound wiith gold lettering.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:36:08
The herbs are used to cook ghormeh sabzi (Amir's fav iranian food) this is very important for the creative process. Please donate more herbs.

It wasn't Jamila who posted, I posted a comment. As some of the info given to Andy had been misinterpreted. the hotel wasn't broken in to, it was owned by amir's father and the bibles would have been sent to the rubbish dump as the property was being redeveloped. Amir's father was strict and wouldn't tolerate rudeness from his children, but he wasn't unpredictable, he gave Amir plenty of freedom and spoilt him. He was a very caring father who only wanted the best for his only son. Amir had a very liberal up bringing. He was encouraged to learn and achieve a good level of education.  I decided to remove my post after I knew Andy had read it as I have no intention to discredit Andy in anyway as a journalist, only to correct some minor facts which could cause offence to Amir's father.

I used to say similar things to my son, when I didn't understand Bitcoin. I'd tell my son to get a proper job, developing free software is working for charity, Bitcoin doesn't have real value - how wrong I was. Apply to tescos or work for a large tech company,his father would tell him he'd set him up with his own business or go back to university...now he's a Bitcoin dev, creating open source software for every one to use and living a life of freedom. Follow your dreams, not your parents dreams.

Amir has a team of incredible people who have worked hard to bring this project together, They all deserve praise and acknowledgement for their contributions to Dark Wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-14 07:57:09
I love the simplicity and humour of this video.

Different people have different requirements for pleasure and happiness, we can't put them in a basement and make them eat bread and water and say "make us our software, make it work good". Herbs are a vital part of any good recipe, and mint is so expensive nowadays.
Support DARK WALLET, for your freedom.
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:12:30
Indeed he is amazing and incredible. But we must also commend the amazing team working with him on the project, they too are amazing people.
@_date: 2014-10-08 08:32:27
Amir is a breath of fresh air and inspiration. Well worth reading. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 10:05:40
And will you be documenting the exact number of peas you include in your meal, squares of toilet paper and oxygen expenditure for full transparency? thx
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:25:26
There will always be the haters trying to discredit him. But those who know him will always give there support. AMIR IS AMAZING.
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:58:28
this article is completely bias in support of foundation members. it really doesn't give a true picture.
@_date: 2014-07-10 11:27:51
Back in 2011 I also though thought my son was wasting time and resources on Bitcoin and would tell him to go find a real job with real money. How things have changed these past few years. He has stayed true to Bitcoin and educated me in the wonders of this exciting new technology. Making decisions for yourself is part of growing up, decided what you want and following your dreams and not your parents. You don't have to invest all your cash, buy a few and see how it goes. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:34:42
actually he didn't intentionally try to scam anyone, the problem was they had the coins stored in Bitcoinica when he accidentally released the source code and Zhou Tong stole the coins. You need to read ALL the facts rather than reading a few snippets and then trying to pass judgement.
@_date: 2014-10-03 07:07:47
Excellent Amir, enjoy your interview.
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:30:52
At first I was afraid my son was wasting his life on this and would having nothing to support himself if this new technology didn't work out. I was afraid for him. I'm of a different generation who grew up without computer technology...my son educated me in this field. I have seen the sacrifices he's made these past 4 years regarding Bitcoin, living in squats, having no money, making mistakes and then getting back up and starting again....because he believes in this and nothing I say would stop him. I admire his determination and passion. I have two choices support or turn away - he's my son, I love him and I will always be there for him. I respect his way of life and his selfless humanity, he has educated me shown me you don't have to follow the system.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:35:22
I love all this new technology being developed to protect our privacy, exciting times.
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:05:08
Amir definitely is not a Kurd, his interest lies in the Rojava revolution and the  transformation in their society through the implementation of a hybrid model of socialism and direct democracy.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:08:43
Amir is alive and well. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:47:54
his muscles went to his belly, as they ate burgers and pastries all day, everyday. He's now lost the weight and slim again.
@_date: 2016-06-04 08:23:22
NO, he didn't steal the coins. Zhou Tong stole the coins.
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:51:05
they were fooling around, everyone knows those comments weren't serious.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:52:17
Amir is an amazing selfless person who works tirelessly trying to make the world a freer place, what ever he's doing is for the freedom of others. He is well and working on a project which requires all his concentration.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:53:41
Start listening from around 52.00mins   
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:25:27
some of those sites on twitter weren't set up by Amir. Amir is well and has everything he needs except his passport.

Yellow journalism by Coindesk. 
Quote from the news article 'In his first interview about a new unnamed project –in  which he simply calls it 'The Academy', not 'Radical Academy'.

I like what she has to say. She makes more sense than the rest of the cocksuckers here.
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:01:25
Amir also created the first bitcoin conferences and brought bitcoin to the media.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:24:31
BS. They were set up. Zhou Tong stole the funds. After this Amir decided he didn't want the responsibilities of dealing with others peoples money and the hassle from the Banks to close Intersango.
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:49:36
BS...it never happened.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:00:10
Amir deplores any oppressive regime, especially those based on religion and those which suppress women. He would never join or support ISIS, he's atheist. Re read his articles.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:36:34
You're making assumptions about someone you know nothing about. Amir is one of the most trust worthy people I know, he has no interest in wealth or material objects except his computer. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:26:44

and they got their sofa off free-cycle and carried it across London to the G8 building, which can be viewed in this link...
@_date: 2015-11-09 20:35:55
Actually Amir was devastated by his mistake, dealing with it at the time was too much for him. He was young naive and lacking professional experience. After this incident he decided that being responsible for other peoples money wasn't for him.
Some of those who lost coins through Bitcoinica also handled the situation equally a bad by sending threats to the group.
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:17:58
Seems many of these bitchcoiner's can't separate the truth from the fiction and base their comments on hearsay rather than doing some research. Without Amir bitcoin would never have gotten the attention it needed in the beginning, Gavin wanted to hold it back and told Amir back in 2011 bitcoin wasn't ready to go public. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:02:05
Open bazaar is built on the foundations of Dark Market, he created the first full reimplementation of the bitcoin protocol named libbitcoin, Libbitcoin He worked on Electrum, Darkwallet which is on a back burner at the moment and plenty of other minor projects. It seems you're very bias and negative and looking for ways to discredit Amir. Move on and free yourself from this hate thats eating inside you.
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:02:58
Amir doesn't like or support ISIS. BBC Click cut and edited much of the interview. Amir is atheist and he doesn't believe in oppression of women. ISIS represents all the things Amir hates.
Amir is alive and well and is using his energy to work on some project which needs a lot of concentration and commitment.
@_date: 2016-05-12 06:28:16
only tainted by those who jump on the band-wagon and don't know the full story.
@_date: 2016-05-12 06:25:40
the difference is... Gavin was old enough and experienced enough to know better, where as Amir was 23 yrs.
 
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:21:02
No!!! he went to Rojava to help with technology and got recruited in to the YPG, not the PKK!!
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:58:26
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Gavin and Ver are the bitcoin bullies.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:22:16
Amir was with the YPG, NOT the PKK!!
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:21:11
Many of the comments are made by those who don't really know know him. Trolls who have read a few posts and assume it's all true. 
Amir is a wonderful fun loving guy, self taught, clever and talented. He works for free writing open source software. He is one of the most humanian people I know. He wouldn't think twice about giving away his processions to help another person in need. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:12:41
Intersango closed because of Metro Bank wouldn't permit the use of it's Business acount for bitcoin trading, which came about straight after the Bitcoinica incident. Handling other peoples bitcoins was a huge responsiblity, the group decided to close Intersango, Amir handed the admin over to Patrick as he had other projects which needed his attention.
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:56:14
The skype link was Amir's sister joking with him, lumos is his sister. This was never anything more.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:06:34
Amir doesn't care who see it as it was nothing more than Amir joking around. It was never meant to be taken serious.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:55:46
Amir is completely against ISIS and any political ideology which surpresses the freedom of women. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:57:05
 The sex for sale posts weren't serious, they were joking around. Secondly the Uk exchanges had business accounts. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 06:31:05
Amir is a strong feminist supporter, atheist, libertarian who thinks ISIS is a cancer. Go read the posts in full before making an ass of yourself.
@_date: 2015-02-23 09:22:07
these forums are nothing more than gossip pages with facts taken out of context. Amir doesn't even bother to read them anymore. Anyone with a brain can read the content and see they're all joking around and was started by Amir and his sister in jest. So many of the comments on this page have no value, the facts are mostly incorrect or exaggerated in some way and posted by bullies who've never meet him and don't know him. Amir is a wonderful fun loving person, he was one of the first people to bring Bitcoin to the public against the wishes of others. He's dedicated many years working on various projects, for free. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:52:43
The majority of clients had their funds returned, but a few disputed claimed remain unreturned, along with those who failed to file a claim.
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:48:01
He probably had no desire to talk with those who'd set out to cheat himself and his team over Bitcoinica, he's not a confrontational trouble maker.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:16:04
Thank you for posting this link 'account' (Bitcoinica, theft, lies, extortion etc...) it gives a very precise account of events concerning Bitcoinica. Amir, Patrick and Donald were nothing more than scapegoats, they were set up from the start. I can also varify that Amir's change of direction is partly due to those events. Losing people their Bitcoins was something amir never wanted to be involved with again. Amir was one of the first pioneers for Bitcoin, bringing it to the attention of the media, organising some of the first Bitcoin conferences.  
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:14:23
In the UK you can have sex at 16 yrs without parental consent. You can marry at 16 yrs with parental consent. But please be assured no  girls or boys were actually involved. If you read the posts you'll realize they were all joking around. The person BitcoinOdyssey doesn't like Amir and constantly tries to abuse and bully him through these forums. Sad but true.
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:33:43
It's not sick, 16 is the legal age of consent in the UK and many other countries. The comment was a joke, which some troll has taken out of context to constantly try to smear Amir's name.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:44:40
They were setup, they funds were being stolen right from the start.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:27:31
actually the post was a joke between Amir and others on the bitcoin forum started by Amir and his sister. Also 16 is the legal age in the UK.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:45:32
Amir is individual, he's far from weird.
