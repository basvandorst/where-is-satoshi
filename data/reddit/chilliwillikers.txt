Alibaba IPO today perhaps?

Rock hard.  When you're pulling the sales that Amazon likely is, even a percentage point can equal large $$$.

I have but one upvote to give.  Well said.

Try having 22 "lost"/stolen in an early market "hack".  Feels bad, man. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:50:47
Roman stole that shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:56
He took 22 of mine. I'm broke af or I would/would have also gone after him. Of course I would not be broke af if I were in possession of my bitcoins, but life's a bitch like that. It's as depressing as it is infuriating. 
Fuck you, Roman Shtylman you fucking snake. Fuck.

I too was absent.  Did anyone take notes so I can get caught up? 
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:28:08
So the definition of regulation, yeah? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:35:31
45! That sucks so hard uuugh
There's some solace in shared suffering I suppose lol  I know there were many others who suffered hefty losses in this debacle. 
I would love to hear a legal opinion on the matter.
Like I said, the fact he basically ignored the cries of those affected before slipping quietly into the night speaks volumes. 
Good luck, friend!

I don't have proof he stole them, but the whole thing seemed shady as hell...and if you consider the time frame, back when bitcoin was cheap(!!) and hardly anyone knew about it, the impetus to hack shit just wasn't as strong as it is now with the price being where it is now.  But a "hack" that occurred very closely to the time his bank told him to fuck off is convenient, to say the least. So that is purely speculation on my part. But, the way he handled it, put fingers in his ears and went "lalala can't hear you", before promptly disappearing from bitcoin almost entirely (doesn't even mention Bitfloor on his current web presence while pimping his Node JS projects) leads me to believe he fucked off with everyones coins - because he knew there would be no consequences.  Bitcoin is only just now being taken seriously.
I do however have screen shots of my balance, and iirc a few screenshots of emails I sent to "support". Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the email account I used for that exchange. 
I was right to invest in bitcoin back then, but I got robbed, and you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little fucking salty about it lol

Fingers crossed! haha

Thanks for the reply.  And thanks for the clarification on fees not being assessed for this particular transaction.  I will most certainly set a transaction fee for future transactions.  
Blockchain.info is still showing that no transactions have occurred for this particular address, and my wallet is still empty.  I have just sent an email to Bitfloor's support, so maybe they can shed some light.  
As I said in my original post, I'm glad my test withdrawal was a small one.  It won't sting at all if my 0.09546 btc was lost to the ether!
@_date: 2012-09-21 16:24:53
Or no commission trades...
@_date: 2012-08-01 04:34:59
Thanks for the reply.  I can only guess that Bitfloor has yet to release my measly 0.09546 btc.  What are these faucets you speak of?
@_date: 2012-08-02 18:11:28
Just edited my original post with an update describing a successful outcome.  Rock on Bitfloor, and rock on Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2012-09-21 16:21:50
Glad to see it back up and running.
It was a little disheartening to log in and see a big fat zero next to my BTC in my account overview. I hope Roman makes it right and actually pays back everyone's losses, especially mine;) While I only lost a comparatively small amount, it was enough to sting...
@_date: 2012-08-01 05:32:43
Nifty.  I will check this out.
@_date: 2016-05-20 12:57:45
Nice one,  OP.  I would have tossed you a btc or two for being an honorable mofo :thumbsup:
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:05:58
Gee, I really wish Roman Shitman(Bitfloor bastard) hadn't "hacked" my 22 coins away.  Every time we see an increase in USD/BTC, it stings just a little more.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:53:15
Yeah, Bitfloor says "The servers are misbehaving. Our engineers are looking into it."  What the fuck is going on??  
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:33:51
It could be an exchange moving customers' coins into cold storage.  I once transferred some coins into Bitfloor, sat there and watched the blockchain for confirmations, and freaked out a little when I saw my coins quickly being shuffled out of my Bitfloor wallet address to multiple other addresses in strange seemingly random chunks(like in the image you posted).  However, logging into Bitfloor, my balance reflected what I had just transferred.  It was then that it dawned on me that my coins had just been moved to another wallet, presumably Bitfloor's cold storage.  Before realizing this, I thought for sure I had been hacked somehow.  Talk about a heart attack!
