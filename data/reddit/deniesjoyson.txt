Our missions are a.) to empower virtual currency users by promoting self-governed, community-based decision-making process for settling disputes and b.) to protect the interest of all virtual currency adopters through public voting on technical enforcement. We believe digital virtual currencies as a whole is the most daring world-wide experimentation since the Internet. However the technology is still in its early infancy, far from being mature enough for wide adoption by the mainstream despite the numerous breakthrough applications in its elegant design. Its cryptic nature combined with its lack of public recourse for user mistakes raises the question of whether substituting real-world human responsibilities with pure technologies is a wiser course for the mass to accept. While both continued enhancement to the current protocol and the introduction of new virtual currencies employing more advanced algorithms will unquestionably address some of the inadequacies evidenced today in Bitcoin, an on-going debate over the governance of the currency outside of its protocol has accomplished nothing more than dividing the community into two opposing camps. Meanwhile the consensus decision-making process is still largely absent in the social space, while the census-based Blockchian continues to grow on the technical network. At bitJUSTICE.org we believe in technologies, especially technologies that are not only responsible but also service the common good of the human societies. Still, we're strong proponents of keeping an open, peer-to-peer, consensus decision-making process in the social space as a critical component complementing the Blockchain in the technical space. Finally, we believe a true community-based initiative should not be fearful in and of its own voice.
