Love Andreas!  Would like him to address this video (What is factual and why he’s not worried about it, or is.)

That’s awesome and inspiring. I like my job, but next three years plan on mastering my knowledge in bitcoin and blockchain which is outside my job description.

You stole all of my words.

Debatable. Coinbase Vault is likely far safer than you holding it as your house on a hard wallet.  Yes you lose the control, but no different from a 401k where you don’t hold the assets. 
Give an take with each means of storage.

Maybe they bought them to stop it?

People are idiots if you sell when price drops. Honestly, you deserve the shit results returned to yourself for being horrible investors. 
If your game plan was to HODL, HODL. If you had a short term play that didn’t pan out, ok go ahead and sell off.  Any other knee jerk reaction due to market volatility and that is your bad and no one else to fault.  
I don’t care where it is today. I care where it goes in the next 1,2 and 5 year periods. 
My biggest concern is the developers ‘in charge’ and the LN which is delaying usability.  All other market swings are like wind passing by.  If they don’t nail LN, the ship sinks. Really probably should have increased block size in short term while it’s built.

No it’s not. % diff is all that matters

Right, but rendering it so expensive and slow to use in the mean time only hurts it imo. I understand there are options being considered in conjunction with the LN to ease current/short term. Hopefully we see some improvements.  Not looking for micro transaction level capacity anytime soon.

Can’t see past the fog. Not my loss, theirs.

Wow yahoo did something else besides getting hacked and leaking to the feds. Nice.

Fuck that. There is plenty of space in this market. Still get to find one I truly feel out performs the others. You this this markets over saturated, look at fitness apps.

You only lost if you cash out to US currency. Be Smart. Long haul.

Those that sold in this latest dip that had intended to hold a long time are weak minded and have no business venturing in bitcoin in the first place. I didn't sell anything and picked up more while it was low.

Time for everyone to give up on Twitter. Their response to this have been absolute shit. Horrible company.

So you'd take anything you had on coinbase and move to ledger prior to the fork?

What is all this tipping about?
