Yes, with bitcoins, otherwise, why would slow confirmation times even matter? Nobody would care how long it took. Sadly the stores you bought from probably just didn't know any better
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:14:49
You can also increase the fees with some wallets after you've already sent the coins, to make them go through faster. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:16:41
There are ways to stop the transaction from going through if it doesn't have any confirmations.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:39:08
I don't know the exact process to be honest, but I assume if you put the device in airplane mode immediately after and never took it out it'd also never go through 
I'm not the expert, but I'm like 95% sure this is the case, if I'm wrong, please, somebody correct me
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:47:19
This! Another thing is, everyone in this thread is saying "He could just get his regular salary and buy as much bitcoins as he wants, why not do that?" Well vice versa. I mean how hard is it to get face value for your BTC on LBC for a cash trade or cash bank deposit? 
It's stupid easy for face value somebody will open a trade within a matter of minutes. This guy is changing the fucking game, and we need to encourage it, I'm sure he can either easily get cash, or has enough to not worry about this, I really doubt he just hasn't thought it through.
You go OP, go get more people in your life to accept bitcoin, we need people like you.

Is it too late to make a shitload of money? Maybe even multiply your money 10x? Probably not. Is it too late to take a small $1000 investment and have it turn into $1,000,000? Probably :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:21:45

Stan son did you enable 2 factor authentication on your wallet for those bitcoins I sent you?
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:18:24
Did your email and LBC account have the same password? I assume they were temporary since you did this all with tails

put it in coinbases cold storage and im sure youll be fine
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:02:55
Ohh, that makes a lot more sense now. So if you had one you wouldn't have to use a mixer anymore to keep your transactions fully anonymous.

I had never really considered this but that's very possible. Ross clearly knew about bitcoins in 2009... 
It's quite possible he collected a bunch of coins in other legal ways.
And you guys are foolish to believe that was his only wallet lol
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:11:26

If everybody got their salary in bitcoins everywhere would begin to accept them, of course both driving up the price and starting the revolution we need.

@_date: 2014-07-31 01:36:12
Somebody somehow had your password waited til you got coins and stole them before you moved them. Sorry, they're gone.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:07:31
those coins were from silk road not DPR. they still have his other 144k coins
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:50:58
When you order something online using a credit/debit card you are giving them all the info they need to use it. You are giving them your private key. With bitcoin it doesn't have to be that way you only pay them what they need, they don't go into your account!

@_date: 2014-11-13 05:22:54
You can encrypt your wallet with a password anyways so even if they got the seed they wouldn't be able to move the coins
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:20:22
Why are you not allowed to do this? People are going to buy and sell coins on LBC no matter what, so why does it matter if you give coinbase more business by getting the coins from them?

Just lie about your age on coinbase or circle, still works lol
@_date: 2014-10-10 14:15:03

Look for somebody on localbitcoins.com to trade you btc for amazon money. Sometimes you can even get more for your coin that way.

They should definitely make it easier to find

Do you still have the receipt and did you buy it with cash?
@_date: 2014-08-01 05:14:27
Yeah but they'll slowly eventually all start to accept them and trade bitcoins with each other thus making the price go up

If you're considering putting all this money into mining I hope you've really looked into it. Even if you did get that thing by September when they promise (which you probably wouldn't) it most likely would never hit a ROI after paying for electricity
tl;dr Buy coins instead, it's not profitable now

Download bitcoin-qt client and encrypt it and back it up or sign up with a wallet on blockchain and enable 2fa. Your bitcoins will not grow but the value of them may and probably will increase if you let them sit long enough. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:38:40
The person probably had an ATM in their store, and it benefits him when people buy the coins and then spend them in the store. I don't think an early adopter would sell via purchasing an ATM and selling them all out, lol..
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:37:27
yea he can track his coins all he wants there still fucking gone lol

There are much more then those 8, those are some examples. I am referring to anybody who has had federal charges from purse, there have been many people.
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:11:07
Here, have 8 links to 8 different stories. Nope, people have had to fight federal charges and waste thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:59:52


You really think raided and searched are different things? You're a fucking idiot.


Never said that idiot, link my comment where I did?


Yep! I bet you haven't.
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:09:47
Again, referring to anybody who has had trouble with it, including the 8 individuals listed. Not referring to an individual, we aren't talking about a specific story... Not going to take the risk of using purse when so many people have had problems with it.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:08:21
Well, much like the other dude said, I'm never going to take a %30 discount from amazon if there is even a %1 chance my house is going to be raided and my shit taken back, and having to face felony charges
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:09:32
you're an idiot
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:44:08
Doesn't it need bank account info and shit to signup? That's the whole reason I started using bitcoins in the first place, to avoid putting my personal info on the internet!
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:51:59
Obviously I wrote this before coinbase responded...
@_date: 2015-07-03 05:35:08
It should just email you, asking the BTC address it wants you to send the coins back to, or just have a message popping up on the next screen asking...
But it's not as bad as I thought if you don't need any info just to signup. I was mistaken there.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:40:46
Becuase there are no other reasons as to why anybody would do that. Any offers with those huge of discounts are obviously shady as hell
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:05:34
Well I can't think of a reason as to why somebody would lose %30 of their money to buy bitcoins either so why don't you enlighten us then?
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:19:31
Hypothetical like the many reports of issues with it not working and stuff like that happening on reddit, sure I guess
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:29:52
God are you stupid. Ok fine, "referring to the first one" then I guess. What would me not ordering anything off purse have to do with rape? lol. The first guy was out over 3 grand, and didn't get his shit back for 6 months. Not to mention had his crib raided by the feds. And this was in Europe, imagine what they do in the US.
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:52:41
you forgot to ask jeeves
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:36:46
If you truly believe this is the case I'd highly recommend buying several coins at 250 and selling them at 299 and repeating.
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:31:07
The problem is when it went from like $.25-$100 there weren't better coins out like there are now. We have more stable coins, that're more anonymous, with much less problems now. Btc is realistically only succeeding because it was first, but how long can that go on?
Now go ahead and shower me in your downvotes it's fine
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:34:41
You are doing well as fuck my friend. Do not ever blow that funds, invest it wisely and you can be set for life

@_date: 2015-02-09 07:40:36
They are safe in Coinbase, everybody who says otherwise is paranoid, they are US based and FDIC insured. Not Mt. gox. Set up a strong passed, 2fa, and put large amounts in there cold storage volts and you're definitely fine. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:25:45
A lot of the time it is followed by comments explaining vaguely what it is. If people are saying it's legit I'd at least look into it. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:20:41
Because there are only 21 million bitcoins.
