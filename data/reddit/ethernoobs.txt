Bah.. 40kbtc average last cple of days. Been way above that lately. Thats 20 MUSD per day turnover or 4x the assumption above. Lending alone has been on average above 25MUSD and with rates of 10% pa for the lender that is 1.5% going to bfx. Imho bfx makes more than 5 MUSD pa from swap contracts alone

People choose differently based on their moral compas and their belief in the project/firm. I would take a real whammy on the results for 2016 or even go into debt to solve the situation for my clients. So in this setup I would refund with cash on stock, give bfx coins that can be redeemed upon bfx future profits (to keep clients) or free trading/lending untill clients losses were recouped for the individual accounts. (This to keep clients with me going forward, only way for them to fully recover funds. This way I would also send a clear signal that we sure as hell aint gonna fubar again in the future as we are willing to take too much of the pain for that to be interesting. If they do something like this I will stay on as a client and continue to trade with em. 
Btw, I only had cash and should not be affected if what zane us saying is true.

Zane.  I Am sure other participant provide you with good advices, Please do consider the reputational implication of BFX not taking any financial hit on this. Pardon the french, but you guys did FUBAR on this, and what signal would you be sending to us if you too did not share in the pain? Please maximize the chances of retaining your 10musd++ profit pa business by sharing in the loss. If you do n ot, why would we expect that you going forward will do anything in your power to ensure safety? Stamp took the full hit, thus im still a loyal client of them, I do not expect you to take the full share but BfX is multiples larger and more profitable than stmp..
Hopefully some food for thought

LoL, I just said 5 mill from lending alone. 20musd turnover at 20 basis points is 50k usd a day or 17 musd a year. DO some work ;) I wont but I Guess BFX got more than 30 musd per annum revenue and at least 10-15 in profits
