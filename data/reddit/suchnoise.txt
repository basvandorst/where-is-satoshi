No, it's not. He has blatantly replaced "BIP148" with "SegWit" and you suggest that his comment still applies? No, BIP148 most definitely and obviously and unquestionably does not have anywhere near overwhelming support. He'd admit as much. So the point is irrelevant.


Let's compare to BIP9 SegWit. BIP9 SegWit does not attempt to alter the Bitcoin protocol *before* there is overwhelming consensus among the miners. It does not do so, because it checks for miner signalling from a supermajority. On the other hand, BIP148 and BIP8 don't respect miner signalling at all. So BIP148 clearly and explicitly attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol even when there is not yet, or ever, going to be overwhelming consensus for BIP148.
In other words: If it can split the network (as admitted by Luke-jr) and put the user of that software in a chain that has between 0% and 50% of the hash rate then clearly it does not have overwhelming consensus in that case.

I like USAF MACARONIS! Could you please re-post it elsewhere and let me read this. Apparently it won't work out around here. I really want to read it!

We need no Air Force to block this size increase! It will fail by itself.

You may be right in that part. There's no direct connection to Core as a whole. Although, indirectly, this could *delay* SegWit due to drama. Also, people who refuse to at least distance themselves from this may be suspect. Core could be hurt in these ways.

I see the point. Furthermore, as stated many times by its authors and proponents, it's not just mining consensus that is being deliberately rejected. What is also rejected is market price signalling and developer support (they say it has to come from users, not developers). So BIP148 has no mining consensus; has no market overwhelming support; has no developer overwhelming support; has no node overwhelming support; has no user overwhelming support; has no business overwhelming support. Do you think there can be anything else that could make up for a lack of overwhelming consensus? If so what would that be? Is there any part of comment that you still think is a fair point that needs further consideration?

Er, no.


I won't comment for others, but I'd respect this rule.

You can't derive a signal about a fork coin from the timing of price movements of BTC. There needs to be money betting specifically on one fork coin or another, and high volumes of it. But I don't see people trying to create such a market and derive such a signal. People calling for exchanges not to trade non-BIP148/149 coins at all only shows aversion to the truth (in this case, a market signal) ever coming to light.
I was troubled by what looked like (perhaps I misinterpreted it) you calling into question your own decision to consider promoting this client unacceptable here, but I should nevertheless thank you for the action you took in this particular case.

With the correction that luke-jr is mostly using fear and saying that *not* running that software is dangerous, conclusion is objectively correct, that there is an astroturfing effort around BIP148/149, making the thing look more grassroots than it actually is.
