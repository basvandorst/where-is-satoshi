Look, I get it. I understand how reusing an address not good for keeping my identity secure, and by doing so I am letting the world(or at least the people who know my address) all of the transactions that have taken place using that address. Now, I'm okay with this, and okay with it for for two reasons: 
1) I honestly will probably only get the opportunity(if I'm lucky) to this address once... Only once--Actually seeing as how I've posted this on reddit and that fact I have already used this address(when I bought the bitcoins) I should change it out for a new one.
2) It's mostly for show. While I would love for someone to scan the back of my phone one day, it is not the real purpose. I't there mostly for people to ask "Hey, why do you have a QR code on the back of your phone?" Now, is this sending the wrong message to bitcoin newcomers... maybe. And would using the bitcoin logo do a better job at this...actually yea that's not a bad idea, I might just do that.  
So basically, I'm okay with have an address on the back of my phone because I'm probably never going to use it.

What parent let you on the internet? Go back to playing with your GI joes

An idea of mine is to make an e-ink display into a phone case. You could change the phones design as much as you would like, and in this case display a bitcoin address.

About 50% of my income. The rest is used for the essentials. Gas, food, etc.

They have few cool designs on there to you can chose from.

Next step is to make a case with an e-ink display. But for the mean time I'll be luck to even use this once.

Lol! I was just saying this to a friend who just bought some bitcoins 
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:32:30
That's awesome, cool hat too! I figured even if I never get the chance to use it, at least it will make a great conversation starter.

1. The app could be programmed to stay up to date with my most recently created address.
2. Who ever takes the time to break down all of my transactions from a single address, just to find out what friends gave me money for gas, food, or whatever has some serious problems. I genuinely do not care who knows how much 'small' money I get from friends, family or whom ever. If I was buying/selling drugs, running a business or was obsessively paranoid, I would totally agree with you. 
3. People reuse their addresses all the time by posting them on to their YouTube/Facebook/webpage page to receive donations. Not to mention that putting QR codes on to things, such as artwork, is an incredible convenience.   
Just the fact that you didn't even consider what benefits reusing an address may have shows how narrow you perspective is. 
P.S. If you look to the right of your screen you will find that the Bitcoin subreddit has had the same address posted for months now. (Ad campaign: 16KaCJB7fVuT6hvA7wzgzVjAnHz28bNvvh)

That tweet nor the article made no mention of cryptocurrency. The irony came from the title of the post. That the dollar will never succeed due to hacking, yet we have the same problem with bitcoin wallets and exchanges. It might seem a bit far fetched, but I found it ironic when I posted it.

It may not be pretty, but it's simple and works well. Reminds me of the Reddit website.
