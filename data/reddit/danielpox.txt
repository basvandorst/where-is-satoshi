It was probably just someone selling a big chunk of bitcoins, and then lots of people followed.
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:42:47
Sold half of mine at ~$1160, just to be sure. Waiting for the top with at least half of what I have left. So half of me is still hodling!

Coinbase has been working perfectly fine for me, and I live in Sweden. I've heard a lot of bad news about Coinbase not accepting deposits, but I personally haven't experienced any problems at all. But that's just me.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:57:44
I completely agree, and I appreciate and like your attitude.
That is the way I intend to use Bitcoin, and I'm simply riding on the waves to maximize my profit and increase the value in-hand, like many people do. Had the price not been as volatile then this trading stuff probably wouldn't be quite as big of a thing.
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:58:54
You don't have to go via an exchange in this situation. You could simply do a direct transaction. There are a couple of ways to do this.
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:08:17
Yeah I agree, but you never know what will happen.

This is trustworthy. +1

The thing with wallet words is that, even though they are pretty standard words to us, they're still **very** unfamiliar to computers. So speaking of hacking and brute forcing passwords, a randomly generated password (like so: "s8f3HSdi26aSDlp3") is more likely to be stumbled upon than perfectly spelled human words of a specific language in a certain order. Here's a short explanation: [xkcd: Password Strength](
Also consider the huge amount of words in a language. Ask a person to think about a word, and you try to guess it. Guessing even *one* word is a one in a million chance. Now try doing that with say 12 words, and they have to be in the correct order. Get what I'm saying?

It seems like the rate is still rising, some estimating it reaching $1200/BTC soon. Some people feel like they can use this rise to their benefit, even though it's almost as high as the previous all-time high. As long as it rises you can gain from it, right?
Also, regarding why I personally didn't buy when it was much lower: I simply didn't pay enough attention, and all of a sudden it was on a big rise. Also I feared that since it was so high again, maybe it would fall down, so I hesitated and waited. Eventually I figured it would rise even further and decided to buy anyways.
The second question, why people aren't selling yet: We're humans, and humans are greedy. We want to gain as much as possible, even though we risk losing it. Depending on how much in percentage you've gained, it would probably be a smart move to sell right about now, and wait for it to fall way down before buying again. But if you're a late buyer, and want to make use of the current rise, then you might want to wait until it reaches it's top right before falling.
These are only my personal thoughts, and maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I'm going about things regarding BTC.

Too bad Gemini doesn't work in Sweden, and it's super problematic with several exchanges if you are a student, meaning you can't send in proof of living in said country.
@_date: 2017-01-16 00:23:23
Well I would say: yeah, pretty much.
The thing about Bitcoin wallets is that, you don't actually keep *factual* bitcoins inside of them, only the transactions. The sum of all transactions of a Bitcoin address is its bitcoin balance, your bitcoins.
This means that as long as no one else can get access to your wallet's private key, you're safe. A Bitcoin wallet doesn't contain a digital value of a certain amount of bitcoins stored inside. Rather it's just a bunch of transactions, containing an identifier, a from-address, a to-address, and a value in bitcoins.
The wallet words allow you to restore your wallet, acting as a password for decrypting your public and private keys. So as long as you keep your datestamp and wallet words safe, in whatever way you choose, you're just fine.
Hopefully that explains enough.
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:04:44
It doesn't matter which exchanges are involved, I'm just asking about the procedure.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:42:16
But you still buy and sell?
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:02:08
Here's the thing: You don't *have* to backup the files. What's *required* is that you keep a backup of the wallet words and datestamp, either physically or inside your mind. If you lose access to the wallet words or datestamp, you're out of luck. If you lose access to the wallet files however, you'll be fine. As long as you have your wallet words and datestamp you can restore it.
A backup of the wallet files isn't necessary, it would simply make things a bit faster. Instead of having to restore the wallet, you would simply have all the wallet files on a USB drive ready to go.


No, you don't have to backup your files as well. Just don't forget, destroy, lose, or lend out your wallet words and datestamp.

Yes I believe so too, this year will be really good for Bitcoin. I'm guessing we're right between two bubbles right now, but it's quite difficult to predict.
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:51:50
Yeah I guess so; they deserve it though. (haha)
@_date: 2017-01-11 07:10:05
It's basically a proof of anything. In Bitcoin concerns it could mean proof of you being the owner of some bitcoins, proof of that some transaction has actually taken place, and so on.
It's basically like saying: "Hey, I'm doing this thing right now, and you can all confirm that I did this later since I have a unique hash here in my hand. See it?" Then everyone can look that hash up, in this case in the Blockchain, and see "yeah, that guy did do that thing, at that specific time, with those things, just like he said."
That's how it works, sort of. It's more complicated than that but I guess this description does its job.
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:07:04
Why not just sell it at an exchange? The fees?
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:02:45
I'm guessing the trickiest part of using BTC in a company would be declaring your tax later. Might end up a real mess, but I haven't experienced it so can't say for sure.
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:39:07
Yeah I'm sort of also worried about this. Coinbase is the easiest and best option for me to buy Bitcoin as a student and living in Sweden. I've looked into most big exchanges and either they don't support Sweden, or they require proof of residence (by sending bills and so on) which I cannot provide as a student :|
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:37:13
I'm guessing you might be able to transfer it into another exchange, or something. But how are you willing to accept payments?
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:35:53
Perfect! I'll set up a reminder right away. ;)
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:08:38
As long as you keep your wallet words and datestamp safe and available, you can restore the wallet on any device. In other words, you don't to backup the wallet files in the same way as before. Although, it's good practise to store everything safely anyways.
When setting up your wallet you chose a backup location. Copy that whole folder onto your USB drive, and keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:24:57
Yeah I'm waiting a bit too before buying. Because of the timezone difference I missed the first drop from $1200/BTC, and it never recovered so I could sell. Now I've changed my mind and I'm waiting to use this opportunity to buy.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:05:00
I think it will settle soon, and stay there for a while. We'll see what happens; maybe a big upswing is coming?
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:55:08
Thank you for your advice. I'm thinking of buying today, and then setting a price alert for when it's gotten an increase of like 30-40%, and then waiting for a day or so watching the market before selling. Does that sound like a good idea, or is there something I should adjust? I'm thinking of spending around $60 on this buy, so not sure whether to buy all at once or split it up and buy a little at a time.
Also, another thing. Let's say I buy now at ~$900/BTC, and then the price falls down to like ~$300-400/BTC, do I just wait for it to rise above $900/BTC or do I use that opportunity to buy even more? Of course I have to stay up to date with what's going on in the market, so that it's actually not crashing (not that I think it will).
I generally make terrible choices when buying things. It's always a bad deal. So that's why I'm asking for advice, and I appreciate that you and others have replied to this post!
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:58:59
Judging by the design I would prefer, but I just checked and unfortunately it doesn't work in my country. :(
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:26:04
Very interesting concept of 3D printing wallets!
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:52:19
That's true, didn't think about that tbh
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:20:04
Buy now! You will never get this offer again!
*waits for an hour*
For those of you who missed our previous offer, here's a special offer for you: 20% off!
Every. Single. Time. Haha
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:20:42
Haven't tried Kraken before, but exploring Gemini atm. I have coins on Coinbase and BTC-e.
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:13:59
I got a bit worried there for a second haha. Great read!
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:58:43
Note: These are only my thoughts about it all. The full article can be found here: [Why 2017 Could See the Collapse of the Euro](


The point noted in the article noted that rich countries with Euro have gotten richer, but poor countries with Euro have gotten even more poor. In that remark it hasn't been able to unite the involved countries with a steady currency.


Doing the math, those 5% would still be some 17 million people, just within Europe.


Yes, I truly hope Bitcoin will steadily keep on growing, and I doubt it will fail us. But with this post I simply wanted to know what the community thinks will happen to Bitcoin **if** Euro actually crashes.

This reminded me of the "if you don't hold your keys, you don't own the money" proverb. I now transferred all my online bitcoins to my personal wallet.
This is indeed the recommended way of trading.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:52:39
Yeah, I'm kind of divided on this. Do I sell? Do I hodl? Who knows?
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:18:41
Also, it really isn't about the amount, it's more about the percentage. So whether it was €50 or €5,000 it wouldn't matter, but I see your point!
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:53:45
Yes, but only if it drops enough to be profitable for me. I am a student (for another month), and therefore I can't invest in particularly big amounts of money.
I like Bitcoin and everything around it, so I'll stick to it in one way or another, but it's about time for me to get settled and be satisfied of my profits so far. The risk is a little bit too big for me atm, but I'll come back later.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:34:23
Thank you! Yeah, I'll stick around. Bitcoin, or really digital currencies overall, are here to stay!
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:15:36
As I mentioned in a sub-comment, I'm a student. After buying those €50 I had the majority of all my money in BTC, and for the rest of the month I was literally broke in all my bank accounts! I only get ~€100/month, and much of that goes to pay things off, so it's a rough business for me atm.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:58:35
I bought €50 at €860/BTC, then pretty much panicked when it started dropping at €1,107/BTC, so sold €50 worth of BTC just to be safe. 30% profit.
Now I still have around 0.013 BTC, which would give me roughly €23 if selling now. All in all a 46% profit, but could've been a ~108% profit if I would've kept hodling!
I still have some leftover BTC since my mining period a few years ago, about 0.022 BTC. So, if I would sell all the bitcoins I have I'd get around €63. I'm thinking about selling it all soon before it falls, and then buy after some time. Not sure though.
