Check mate!

An app to lend to your friends sounds like a terrible
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:30:05
Ridiculous as: squares aren't actually square.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:25:33
As a noob trader I had to laugh so much at this! all been there before!
@_date: 2016-12-02 10:11:02
Very moon
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:48:11
I just sold all of mine and bought doge
@_date: 2016-12-12 22:02:23
keep up ;)
its 111% if youre here in the UK
@_date: 2016-12-09 09:14:12
It will probably take a crisis for bitcoin to find its place in the world
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:26:16
Of course they want it gone. luckily its not their choice
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:58:35
OP: since this is your post, can you make a google spreadsheet with the results and do an average?
@_date: 2016-12-14 09:44:45
Wait.. what? isnt that the same speech from independance day?
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:11:26
well its not me! he started it! i just came for the postings
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:03:21
I probably would have run a test tx first
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:48:54
yeah? no more than that huh? thanks for sharing
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:22:31
I dunno, I think we should be able to buy a coffee. lets not go into ethereum-delusion mode.
We need LN
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:52:25
its hard to use log when you are in windows paint
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:29:04
sucks so much that this is news
@_date: 2016-12-01 22:27:17
Amazing service, really cool
Who is the service providing the lines? what happens if someone broke the law and the line was traced to you?
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:19:53
Ok, im back.. whats the price now?
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:10:19
Zonky from tradingview crypto chat room?
@_date: 2016-12-12 22:10:09
hes a big pricer
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:16:40
Exactly, 12b is naff all. 
And when it does popup on their radar, they will probably want to jump on board blindly and ride it up like the never-ending-Dow
It would be easy money for investment bankers
@_date: 2016-12-10 15:45:57
Whats to stop trading platforms using LN?
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:39:08
Oh you must be new here &lt;--- dickhead!
@_date: 2016-12-01 22:29:43
Thanks for the info, the passphrase is highly strong
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:19:25
aye aye captain!
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:48:29
The NY times said there was a 93% of hillary winning. They were correct because there was a 7% chance of trump winning, and he did
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:17:17
noo noo, we can never make a full snappy
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:07:24
Did somebody say pump?
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:13:34
jesus no, physical bitcoins. are you mental? Bitcoin is a payment network not some metal coins. youre weird
@_date: 2016-12-20 15:05:57
hundreds.. lol
1.2 billion people in india
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:23:16
This statement is so true. that its true.
just when you think you have enough you need to buy moar!
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:04:11
no, unless it was criminal and I think you need a police report
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:47:04
I second your lol
All I need is a payment network.
@_date: 2016-12-12 13:56:58
I think 13.8Billion is ATH
@_date: 2016-12-08 09:44:25
agreed! amazing work!
@_date: 2016-12-09 11:50:46
id say the opposite, ltc is about to die forever, bitcoin is about to explode
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:11:09
such losses
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:47:50
yeah we have done this one many many times. fuck, I think ive posted it twice!
@_date: 2016-12-07 11:22:46
I agree, they could have been more cautious about their predictions however, it felt like a pump to me
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:31:15
ok so if someone got hold of my seed list, its useless without the passphrase?
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:36:51
A really cool feature in reddit would be to replace [deleted] to [regretted]
Would be a great reminded for us all to think more before we speak
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:28:44
I just showed this to my gf to show how our bitcoin performed.. she said "wow, I just wish it didnt go up so slow"
@_date: 2016-11-30 21:31:18
Yes it could theoretically
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:30:28
and the new gen of GPU's perform as fast as the last gens that are double the price
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:28:29
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:27:44
So youre telling me we need more price posts?..... 
@_date: 2016-12-09 09:13:21
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:07:55
id say 800 handle is more likely
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:06:21
People must have read these kinds of articles for too many years and thought "WTF is this bitcoin, why is it still here"
I still believe we are in the oblivious stage
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:29:55
I bought NEM too.. HODL FTW
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:05:36
really makes me feel: But why?
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:50:06
Funny thing is she is amongst us in the few comments on this post. weeping...questioning...regretting...
@_date: 2016-12-12 19:39:30
Do you mean etc etf? or bitcoin etf?
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:08:01
@_date: 2016-12-03 14:34:09
Since I bought in early 2014 and transferred in 2015, does this mean I can offset the losses against my taxes?
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:57:45
FULL MOON PARTY!
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:49:38
nah just get a trezor
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:56:57
Because thats how you can not be called a liar
If I say there is a 0.00001% change that bitcoin will be above $100, then if it is. I was correct
Dont you read the NY Times?
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:24:22
2016 is more like 80% at todays price
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:24:48
not if you are a hodler
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:16:51


The megabubble is upon is. MWAHAHAHAHA!
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:43:15
