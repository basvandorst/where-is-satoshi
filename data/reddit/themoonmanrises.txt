I had extra USD. Was waiting for prices to hit a certain point and we finally got there. I just take a % of my paycheck but now I'm not putting anymore USD into crypto until mid January unless it dips a massive amount

Shouldn't you be in r/bitcoinbeggars

Coinbase is good for your initial purchase. Easy to use. But after that move your stuff elsewhere as Coinbase suspiciously stops working at big dips, plus the 3% fee is ass
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:02:37
Literally no one knows
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:44:43
Well you must be brand new. Coinbase constantly stops working everytime there is a huge dip. It's fucking sheisty and people are missing out on thousands of dollars
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:57:01
[Lmao this dude actually out here asking for handouts](

Make your initial purchase on Coinbase. It is easy to use and good for noobs. Next, sign up for GDAX. GDAX is owned by Coinbase so if you're using the same computer it should automatically log you in with the same account you use on Coinbase. Transfer some USD to your GDAX account. This takes a few days to process. Watch some YouTube videos on "GDAX Limit Buying". You will set it up so that when the price of bit coin (or ethereum or litecoin) hits a certain number, you will buy at that price with no fees

Just sucks waiting for the USD to transfer over

This was me a year ago when it was only $600 :( had no idea I could buy fractions and I'm beating myself over it everyday because $600 was a lot to me back then
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:34
Thanks! I had no idea how to read GDAX lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:12
Just ride everything out my man. Never know if one of those altcoins will be worth a shit ton in a few years
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:07:53
Well the first rule was to not invest more than you were willing to lose so theres no one to blame but yourself if you didn't follow that. This will bounce back hard. Let all the weak handlets fold and buy their coinage.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:59:40
Snooze ya lose
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:05
I advise waiting for a dip. This is an all time high. Not a recommended move 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:47
Or it may dip a lot like last week when I bought when the ath was in the 11,000s then literally 2 hours later it dipped into the 9000s. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:09:04
I love dips! Been waiting all week for this!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:17:16
Hope we dip down to 10k to get rid of the weak hands and so the rest of us can buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:08:33
I hear ya. A year or so ago when each bitcoin was $600 I wanted to buy in but was under the assumption that I had to buy entire bitcoins. Didn't realize I could buy fractions and I was in a tough spot financially so couldn't swing it back then :( 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:59:50
Instant for credit card. Takes a few days for bank account but you get the btc at the price you bought it at
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:03:48
\&gt;tfw you only own .03 btc
When's this thing gonna dip so I can buy more?!  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:38
Honestly, everyone talks but no one knows
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:11:57
Always better to buy low
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:56
Guh, I bought a bunch this morning. Shoulda waited. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:07
You know you don't have to buy an entire bitcoin right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:32
Been fucky all day
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:28
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:01
This morning I put $300 into bitcoin, $300 into ethereum, and $100 into litecoin! Girlfriend is not very happy with me but hopefully a year from now she's singing a different tune!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:36:50
Thank you for the response! This is a very helpful community :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:14
Just ride it out. In a week it will be 15,000
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:27
I hear ya man. In a week I'm sure this dip will be forgotten. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:51
Obviously lower is better. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:38:17
Thanks for posting this. I didn't know that until this morning and I decided to buy 2.5% of a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:38
I guess not
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:47:22
Coinbase will email you immediately if the payment goes through
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:25:54
Thanks for the response. I am new to all of this and this morning I spread $700 between bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin with coinbase. Looks like I need to look into electrum.
