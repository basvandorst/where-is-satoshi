A minute I guess. Depends on how fast you press the few buttons.

Straight answer, I like that. Basically Bitcoin is a competitor of PayPal.

No, not directly. Tho, there are providers of cards that lets you convert your bitcoin funds into $. And also provide a debit card for them. So all in one platform.
I have used wirex and cryptopay in the past.
On both platforms it works basically like this: You transfer bitcoin to their custom wallet, then you can choose to load your debit card with the bitcoin you have transferred. Before that you either have to create a "virtual credit card" or order a plastic one. 
Ordering one can cost some money. Then once you loaded the card you can use it like a normal debit/credit card.

how do i resend it?

Thanks for the reply :)
I know it is not 100% secure like if you create your own wallet with your own computer but it is a really fast and easy way. And I personally use this but as my main wallet.
So I am just happy with it :)

~~i hope so~~
well hopefully it clears up when the transaction is confirmed.

after all it was my mistake :(
i created an array which was updated every time a user typed in the transaction details and let other users send it with their confirmation. well that won't happen again i guess.

yes, next time :P

This not the same. GetGemz did something else.

that is really weird, as the transaction should only be send one time to one address (1KE6P..)
