That blonde guy looks too hip to be Satoshi.

I don't feel like that title is an SEO trick. The search term "mtgox" probably isn't all that popular anymore.

OkCoin's inability to build out a quality site doesn't mean that bitcoin.com isn't worth $10k/mth.

You can easily send bitcoin from your Kraken account to an external wallet. Here are the steps:
- Log in to your Kraken account
- Go to your Funding page and click "Withdraw"
- Click on "Bitcoin (XBT)" in the left sidebar
- Click the "Add address" button in the middle of the page
- Drop in your Hive wallet address with a brief description and save
- Select your Hive wallet from your drop-down list of withdrawal address
- Make your withdrawal
That's a lot of steps but the process is intuitive. You'll also need to dig up your Hive wallet deposit address.

It's unfortunate that the Dark Wallet guys slapped your logo so prominently on their Bitcoin Foundation hate speech video. All I got from that video was that some guys, including KyleDrake, absolutely hate the Foundation - Oh, and also, they are building some sort of wallet no one will use.

Bitcoinstarter.com and Coinfunder.com seem like worthy pro-Bitcoin crowdfunding sites. The problem is that if you really want to raise a lot of cash, you won't get enough eyes. That said, this Android thing managed to raise 16 bitcoins:  I'm impressed.

Totally. Everybody likes to conveniently ignore that. But Havelock is making a leap forward, as they've been flying under the radar illegally in Canada. 
IDK much about regs in Panama, other than it's supposedly a "free-for-all" :D It's not surprising that the US has the stance that it does considering how many nations in the world have such scant regulations...
I'm not a statist wank, but I believe some regs are better than none.

It means doing something that seems pretty mellow, when in fact you are intending to be aggressive. OP's posting of the Bitcoin price on Facebook would seem harmless, but really his intention is to make his EX feel shitty. I don't think that's cool. Just move on, leave the poor bitch be.

Toronto is totally due for a full-fledged conference like this. The community there is solid and the organizers know what they're doing. This is gonna be good.

Great move, Crypt-O'-Lantern space will see huge growth in '14.

$10 above market price for a convenient in-person cash transaction is a great price.

Why would he spend his own money when he can spend yours? I wasn't here during the Bitcoinica scandal, but all I hear is shadiness coming from Amir Taaki. I'm always looking for leaders and groundbreaking projects, and this group of guys come across more like misguided scammers/false ideologues imo :D

I don't remember the cat from the original game, but I remember this dragon :)

Congratulations on your excellent Bitcoin purchase last year!
I'm a poker player, and I've had it all on the line several times. My wife respects me for the risks I take because she knows how much thought I put into the moves I make, and how I grind on my decisions. She and I are extremely happy together and have a beautiful baby. 
My point: in order to be happy, you have to find a woman who believes in you for who you are.
p.s. my advice is to always avoid being a passive aggressive dick
