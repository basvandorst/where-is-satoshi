If your dirty old coal plant is so cheap it can mine Bitcoin with it then you're doing something very wrong.
Smells of corruption.


That's ridiculous.


lol this gets better and better.

There is plenty of that in the world for them to compete against.
Without these politicians buying their miners, workers and power these farms wouldn't get off the ground.
If that's the only customer your old tired coal plant has or is every going to have, then it's time to shut it down. You use mining to open up new power markets, not to keep an old one alive long enough to take some tax payer money.

It's more that government should *stop* intervening to prop up consumers of that power and subsidising their purchasing of it with tax payer funds.
Obviously there is something out of whack here if a coal plant can compete globally with cheap sustainable sources  well outside of population centres (low local demand). 
Some politician here somewhere is making a lot of money from these setups.

At no stage is there any reason to ever record a deterministic wallet seed phrase in electronic form. Encrypted or not.
What is the point of taking a long list of words and encrypting it with a password which is another long list of words. Then storing that digitally and your long list of words physically. You gained nothing but more electronic exposure.
**Never** store seeds electronically, encrypted or not, it defeats the purpose of having such a seed.
To then rely on a chip in a USB flash drive (or two) to store this critical information is risky at best.

Volatile storage? No.


Why did you save it in plaintext to your HDD?


You've got a password for your passwords password right? What was the point again?

You can place that bet here: 
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:15:35
There was never any reason to save in plain text, or encrypted.
Simply write down your seed and store it physically. Nothing to hack.
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:58:32
That's the whole point. It's promo for them, selling the idea that BTC isn't utilised. 
Pulls the right strings to get upvoted here where overt spam would not.

What other things can you find with perceived correlation?

Defence in depth.
Tamper evident seals allow a user to know their device hasn't been tampered with in-transit.
Chips are nice, that's another level of defence.

It shows that packaging has been tampered with. It mitigates any attack which requires physical access. There are good ones which are difficult if not impossible to fake.
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:59:57


Refuses to add tamper evident seals citing that they'll only be faked.

All charities are scams. That's the entire point. They are easy money for someone who doesn't like working.

The source: 
 You delivered a speech on cryptocurrencies which generated a big echo among fans of Bitcoin. Are cryptocurrencies money?


 So, how do you account for the hype surrounding them?


 ... which were precisely the words that annoyed the crypto-community. You don't think there'll be a happy ending?


 The market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies is low, so there is no threat to the financial system. Should central banks intervene at all?

If you're going to wait for Bitcoin to take it's place based on altruism you're going to have a bad time.
Greed is adoption, speculation is network effect, self-interest has worked fine for every human endeavour throughout our evolution.
If it weren't for selfishness the whitepaper would have been the last we ever saw of this "cryptocurrency" idea.

Meanwhile they built the foundations for the scientific method. Their misguided delusional attempts were the gift that kept on giving.

Never takes them long to contradict themselves. Ver has been doing the same thing. *"LN is a fraud, but we'll be able to do LN better when we implement it"*. Cake and eating it.
