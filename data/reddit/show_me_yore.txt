I bought most of it 5 months ago and more than doubled my money. $10k in July-August is now closer to $30k. $10k in June-July is like $60k.

I woke up at 18k on coinbase, sold at 17.5, missed a dip and saw it rise back up steadily so bought at 17.3.
Then it dropped below 16 and I freaked out. Then it's been steadily rising when I check.
I lost about $75 and am back where I started the morning on btc. Never again will I try that shit, I'm not patient enough and worry.

But at least they have skin in the game. Rather than sitting on the sidelines talking shit while we gain.

Two threads made the front page of yesterday and so many people who know jack shit were acting like experts.
"Its going to keep going lower, the bubble burst"
"Now is the worst time to buy"
"People on say prices are a cycle, it will crash then rise. They're delusional."
People who don't even have .0001 btc act like they know something and it's so annoying.

20k to 6k isn't a bear market?
