No. It never came so i requested my order cancelled and my money returned and it was released back onto my credit card.

I cancelled my order and the money was released back onto my credit card

Since the transaction is stuck in pre authorization there's nothing I can do at the moment. It has to fall back into my account when it expires. So as of now I can only sit and wait and hope my coins arrive OR contact Simplex and ask them to cancel my order and not to bother. Which I think i may do now.

Thanks for the reply. How long did your payment take to process?

Thankyou for the reply. I have since been in touch with both Simplex who is their payment partner I guess and Coinmama themselves. Their customer service was friendly and helpful. I was told because my payment needed to be manually reviewed it could take up to 48 business hours which I assume means 2 days. I will post again once I get my coins.

Yeah I also used credit. It's been 21 hours so far for me. I don't mind waiting if I actually get my coins but I must say I didn't expect it to take this long. It shouldn't take a day to process a CC transaction.

I had similar issues. Although mine had to do with payment processing - not blockchain confirmations Read my thread. 
Ultimately i asked for my transaction to be cancelled and I got my money back. I dont think it's a scam but theres definitely something fishy going on with the amount of time they claim it takes to "process" a credit card payment.

This was copied from an older thread that has long since been buried. I wanted fresh advice.

Thanks. However my pressing concern now is what to do about the situation I'm stuck in.

I did get my money back so it doesn't seem to be a scam - just an unreasonably long time to wait for a payment to be authorized.
