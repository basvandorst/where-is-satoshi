Let him believe it if it stops him from gambling. Hopefully he's not throwing money at it still to figure out how it's rigged hahahahaha

I'd save on the umbrella and get a train ticket to a hostel instead.

The title is pretty misleading.
If ~~Fiat~~ Tesla didn't accept bitcoins, then this doesn't demonstrate the buying power of bitcoins at all. The acceptability is what's most lacking at the moment, and the fact that you can buy cash with bitcoin then buy things with cash really isn't news.

I feel bad for the people buying them even at US$300/BTC

Lol I remember doing this at a McDonald's when I was 6 or something.

Well I think it matters whether a bitcoin is worth a penny's worth of anonymously traded goods or a million dollars worth.
Do you not think acceptability of a currency affects its value? Do you think that if suddenly no on in the world wanted US dollars, it wouldn't deflate? Or if everyone suddenly accepted rubies as payment everywhere in the world, people wouldn't want rubies more and therefore inflate its price?

You have all the reason to be mad at MtGox, but MtGox has all the reason to not give your money back too. No good reason, but enough for themselves not to give you your money back.
Believe me when I say that protesters are the least of their worries at the moment.
Save yourself the time and effort and enjoy what you have left. They'll give your money back if they really want to and can. Protesting won't change their minds one bit.
I agree with your cause, but your method isn't going to be very effective.

Doge ≈ dog ≈ bitch
Oh wow so clever, I wouldn't have been clever enough to spot it myself and given you karma.
Oh wait I still wouldn't.

If he is as dishonest as people want to believe at the moment, he'd know he's bluffing and would've taken off long ago. It's not like he's got much to gain by defending his position.

They were both assholes anyway, they left when there was obviously one customer left who hadn't been served.

Typical gamblers don't stop there.
