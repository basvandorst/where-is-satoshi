its all about p2p exchange , not a company to person buy/sell , i believe everything is in white and black , you just trade when you feel the price is possibly correct.  In other cases where p2p from crypto to crypto is concerned , the buying and selling , i believe is purely done on orders .

It offers 100's of payment method to buy, sell and trade bitcoins.
Safe and secure , Escrow trades . Low fee

the other reason could be , because localbitcoins stopped card payments and traffic in pax is increased , thats why specifically for cards they increased , dont think its coz of FinCEN
