That is insane.
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:08:04
Is the hat intact?
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:27:12
Bacon Reader,  Best for reddit.  Any news is proliferated here anyway
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:00:54
Yeah, but the margin and therefore the leverage has gone.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:38:17
Still no new news. It's like that for a week now.
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:34:20
Just discovered this (no add! i just love poker) sadly there are so few players yet.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:53:39
Everyone is right.  Its just a matter of time
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:14:12
But the question is, why does it have no impact?
Or Was the impact seen in the chart around 3:00am in the morning?
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:21:47
Gentleman,  your bets please... 
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:19:44
Me2... also waiting for T3 for about 1,5 weeks now. Whats going on? Have you tried contacting support yet?
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:53:34
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:20:00
"To the Moooooon" 
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:52:45
Possible. I think the comming days will show. When PBOC regulates fees to, volume will take another hit.
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:49:26
I dont understand this. If I asume the amount of transactions are constant or rising, wouldn't this mean, that the Bitcoin System just failed?
@_date: 2017-01-18 19:15:57
My source is the comment you mentioned,  why relies on a chinese Document
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:17:47
But what will be the imidiate effects? 
I see hardly any, trading itself is not bein influenced, just HF-Traders are going to leave, don't they?
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:37:39
Pobc investigation report
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:56:20
Hm, that sound reasonable. But I can't just believe your statement out of thin air as you can understand. But hopefully you are right.
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:26:29
Why was that not possible?
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:10:46
Because over 90% of all traded bitcoin volume is traded in china. Plus, china has the biggest minig companies, having a huge impact of over all network capacity of the Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:24:53
But now you can short ;)
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:57:41
I see no proof of anything here... what is this supposed to be?
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:15:43
So if they bring in trading fees HF-Trading nad vola is going down hard.
Also if BTCC is the only exchange to bring back trading fees (which i seriously doubt) they will be broke in no time because of capital trasnfered to Huobi and OKC
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:01:34
How come you so sure of that?
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:17:35
When I started to get into bitcoin a few feeks ago it was the same. I realized too that i was spending waaaaay to much time. Since becoming a professional bitcoin trader is not a carrier option i decided for my self to get a good longterm position, transfer everything into a paper wallet and just fuck off and dont care.
So i'm waiting on PBOCs last moves and their report, maybe increase my position and then im going to check Quotes ones a day at maximum.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:42:56
Russia went shoping?
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:49:03
Because they depend on it? 
Even if they are not super good journalists somebody has to pay them. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:29:22
Price will fall to hell. Appart from that not much. While the hasrate is going down so will the trasnaction volume. China is generating most of the volume anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:35:03
Thats no good news. Since they seem to be confident thats rules and laws have been violated punishment and fines are a reasonable think to expect.
@_date: 2017-01-13 12:24:31
This chart is BTCC.
@_date: 2017-01-20 10:33:08
Thank you very much for your nice and informative comment on the post of a none native speaker. You have really advanced the conversation.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:25:58
Bullish till friday
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:37:46
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:28:59
Sure thats no bug in your app?
Don't see a problem here.
@_date: 2017-01-23 11:50:08
Thanks, but this only answers why to increase difficulty. I would like to now how this is done. Since a mined Block consists of:
[Hash from previous blocks]+[Hash from current block]+[Proof of Work] and the proof of work is the only thing, that makes mining take any time at all.
Which operations are needed to design a PoW, that takes 10Min. of time given the current hashrate?
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:51:57
yep, exactly
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:33:30
How is a has made more dificult? How does the "proof of work" work?
@_date: 2017-01-23 11:59:32
Thank you, very comprehensive!
Some additional questions:
- So is a hash just an algorithmik solution Y for input X?
- Is the average over 2016 because: 2016/6/24=15 Days? So about 2 weeks?
- Are Solutions whichs difficulty is not high enough technicaly right? --&gt; I feel like the PoW is just an artificial component, since the hash, the block consists of is "right" anyway. (Maybe I have to go more in depth for this one)
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:09:26
Bitfinex and Kraken i guess? I mean you could go for the other oversea ones but if that would realy decrease your risk is debatable.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:25:58
He did not. He expected the right thing but because of the wrong reasons. He talked some TA BS but the Price dropt because of news from China.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:01:09
Well the ATM is better than nothing,  right? Since nobody else wants your money
@_date: 2017-01-24 12:57:16
Bitcoins can be devided till 1/1000000 their value. Please research this well covered topic. Many people wrote on this and even made explanatory videos.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:05:27
This is awesome! Realy good stuff!
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:07:17
The last reminder resulted in an investigation. Im not so sure. I would like to get my parachute...
Especialy, if they allready have violated the rules, there will be consequences for sure.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:19:04
Rob a bank and you get the deposits of multiple clients.
Rob an individual and you get only his deposits.
Much worse risk/revard ratio. Plus uncertainty if the robbed individual is wealthy at all.
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:04:41
Neverthelesse there are always 100% still to go ;)
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:31:55
I was to lazy to add this fact but it's complety right. Chineses traders have a large incentive to "fake-trade" or "wash-trade" to ramp up thair volume. This is one of the reasons for the high volatility.
I read few days ago that the "real" volume might be around 40%  instead of 90%.
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:04:09
Very nice
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:50:14
I think OP and Community are talking in total different directions here :D
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:37:57
Still no new news. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:34:46
Bitcoin itself might not violate any rules, but if the exchanges get punished the BTC price will reflect that, as seen before.
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:11:21
Thanky you!
I cant quite understand what I'm seeing there but I'll try to figure it out :)
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:30:33
This answer is just superb!  Didn't know about the possibility of an attack with less then 50% mining power and under 100% succes rate. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:28:52
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:28:47
Well the BTC price seems to do not give a shit...
What do you guys think? Is this because of irrelevance or because the "No Margin Trading"-Policy took effect immediately?
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:25:27
Hm dunno.
If you design a system and it colapses because it cant withstand high usage, thats kind of a fail.
Like direct democratic systems cant work if a certain size of the population is exceeded.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:36:40
Bought these?
