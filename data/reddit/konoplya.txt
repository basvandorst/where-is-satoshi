I have free concierge service with my credit card and available worldwide and I can even book hookers with them where it's legal
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:02:41

@_date: 2015-06-11 07:48:05

@_date: 2015-06-01 18:43:29

@_date: 2014-07-25 16:11:10
you do that brian
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:22:15
feeling pretty good. thank you. how are you?
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:14:27
you can bet that i wouldn't give a shit
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:25:10
i used a one sentence response, because i didn't want to nor do i want to go into an elaborate essay of explaining. if you take it at its face value, then yes, i do agree with you, it may be confusing, however i don't care enough to justify anything. hope that clears it up a bit.
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:35:54
i don't get the postman reference
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:47:01

fiddy cent knows what's up
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:34:57
i'm not here to argue. there's plenty of resources out there (hint: economic and history books) that after reading and fully understanding you'd see how many people, not just myself, feel that way. hitler was a fascist, but fascism is not hitler. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 03:55:52
again, i'm sorry you're a bit retarded. but another country will extort you as well. if thats still not clear then you have yourself a nice evening.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:09:22
who cares about this hag, even if they decided they had so called authority good luck to them. a piece of paper or some hag doesn't define what i own or do. fuck these people.
@_date: 2014-04-17 04:10:17
under fascism you have corporatist economy, same as we have here. anything else i can help you with?
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:04:03
the statism is strong in this thread
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:56:22
why would you ever want that?
@_date: 2014-11-09 09:33:14
who pays for that advertisement?
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:30:11
i don't expect you to. goes both ways really. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 03:32:08
look up fascism and you'll understand
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:35:25
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:45:45
keep us posted
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:49:09
fuck paypal
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:30:27
i commend you on your efforts to keep writing and explaining yourself in a way that you do after all those dozens of comments. i wish i had your patience. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:58:07
many people "oppose" them, what exactly are you planning on doing?
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:11:19
your "logic" lol. i'd go deeper into explaining how its a fascist country, but its a lot more than i want to type. i'd suggest reading material to you, but i doubt anything can help you at this point.
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:35:01
wow, butthurt is strong in the pussy world i see
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:11:13

fuck apple
@_date: 2014-04-24 04:34:29
you are most likely spot on regarding this. fucking govt.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:13:50
they couldn't regulate bitcoin if they tried
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:37:24
thing is, they are making actions, I'm happy you're content with your lot
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:32:46
let me rephrase that for you: "i'm quite content with the money being taken from me by force by a ruling mob". there.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:13:52
i did :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:02:21
i'd even go further and say its a fascist oligarchy
@_date: 2014-04-17 03:33:06
too bad you're too shallow to understand what i wrote
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:09:19
lol not at all. also, didn't know i could sound via text. interesting.
@_date: 2014-01-03 01:27:25
[Ah, the ol' reddit geekaroo!](
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:01:21
ah yes give the mob extorting your business under the guise of "legality" a finger.. thats bad mmmkay.
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:28:46
every time i go deeper and deeper into these discussions with statists, the more i learn that i should not even bother going there. its like explaining something to a pigeon. and i don't want to talk about myself in a way that makes me more "superior" in knowledge, because i want to give people the benefit of the doubt. but it fails every time.
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:04:50
you can also have many wallets for different purposes. lets say you do a bunch of work privately with people you can have shit stored there and if you're doing business with a company that lets say will have some paper traces or whatever you can have that money being deposited in a different wallet.. your "official" wallet. so essentially you can only show a certain amount to the public.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:13:23
i know you
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:31:28
sarcasm right?
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:19:21
watch out now, you're making sense on reddit
@_date: 2014-08-16 23:16:25
damn fucking straight
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:50:33
merica, fuck no
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:20:11


sheep do
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:32:02
I mean yes, I agree with you that they'll try to control it, but since it's not as centralized as fiat currency and it's not directly controlled or owned by the govt, it will be a lot harder for them to get their meaty fingers on it. also, people constantly innovate new ways of securing and storing bitcoins
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:48:24
right, but thats because snowden chose to reveal his address. if the govt doesn't know my wallet address then good luck finding my bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:32:04
yeah but they don't know who the address belongs to
@_date: 2015-05-22 00:20:50
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:00:14
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:17:40
rogan is about as relevant as any other "celebrity", but i do support him on his "tweet"
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:20:50
i'm still somewhat new to bitcoin, can someone explain? thnx
@_date: 2016-03-12 03:58:19
what a piece of shit
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:32:30
last time I checked the price on it, it was $260. yea I've been out of the loop
@_date: 2016-06-29 18:40:43
[its true](
@_date: 2016-11-01 03:19:23
yeah, but with paypal its a lot easier. credit cards are more strict regarding shit like that.
@_date: 2016-12-03 05:51:43
why is he beating him *into* the store?
@_date: 2016-12-03 05:49:34
according to [forbes article]( the 500 and 1000 rupees were the highest denomination banknotes
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:33:38
if you're a U.S. citizen, otherwise you're shit out of luck
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:36:26
my god
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:45:35
depends who you get. a buddy of mine is really into hookers.. he's married with 3 kids so that might explain a few things, but he gets em off the street for $30. they usually start off at a $100 but he talks them down. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:04:01
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:36:27
I heard backpage is the place to be
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:21:03
think the guy was being sarcastic
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:38:48
what is considered hateful and who decides that?
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:49:33
take a guess at who downvoted you
@_date: 2015-07-03 09:15:03
why is this news?
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:37:24
I don't, had two and both trannies went out before they ever hit 100k
@_date: 2018-11-05 06:09:22
a new meme has been born
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:20:36
dude, zappa said a lot of good stuff. i'm not a huge fan of his music, but i def like what the guy was about.
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:28:48
wait, but regulation is needed, otherwise somalia. reddit is a peculiar place. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:05:05
"go after bad people"... fuck outta here
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:11:29
it would be hard to find it in the rubble of bricks.
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:18:21
that's a whole lot of derp right there
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:23:56
good point, I'll give it a go
@_date: 2015-09-25 08:26:28
what more do you need?
@_date: 2015-09-07 02:45:41
free market ftw
@_date: 2016-10-31 18:48:08
can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-10-31 18:56:22
but you can have another credit card processing tool outside of PayPal no? many websites take credit cards but not through PayPal
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:04:35
i was hoping this link was exactly what it was and it was. nice.
@_date: 2016-10-31 22:50:43
can you recommend any merchants btw? I'm looking to get a site going and want to avoid PayPal at all costs
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:05:03
you're free to shut the fuck up and do what you're told
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:36:00
again, wat?
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:05:51
yes, a lot more uncommon than people think. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 07:28:19
@_date: 2015-03-01 08:56:17
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:02:22
@_date: 2015-10-07 07:34:20
because you people can tell the difference between good coffee and shit
