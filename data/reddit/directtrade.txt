I dont see any rationale to TRUST European/American hashrate more than that of the Chinese. Could not find any such racial division in Satoshi's whitepaper either. Instead, I believe, some European/American hypocrites are crying foul after losing the mining competition to the Chinese.

OpenBazaar wont find its popularity in clearnet. It'll replace the darknet marketplaces. Amazon, ebay are not threatened by anonymous escrows of OpenBazaar. It is the likes of SR that would be replaced by OpenBazaar. The use cases are different altogether.

Come out of this centralized hierarchical command driven mindset. There is no one here to take your command. If u think, something needs to be done, no one can stop u either. The bucks stop at u. So, if u think something needs to be done, u do it.

I would recommend to find sell orders at  or  and show buy interest. Pay FIAT in irreversible payment methods like PerfectMoney or OKpay.

As I understand, we can not have FIAT trade on ShapeShift, like USD/EUR/CNY. Is that correct ?

Accept or not. LBC competitors like  &amp;  are gaining traction. In fact, it was inevitable. The fall of Mt. Gox opened the door for many real time exchanges. LBC stood strong. So the competition is coming slow &amp; low for direct trading exchanges. But, competition should be there. It makes the market healthy.

For  you can fill the site wallet only when u r trading.
For  they dont even have any site wallet concept. You send your coins, only when your trade is in progress.
If your coins are not in site wallet, they are safe from 'Hot Wallet hack' story.

NY is not banning bitcoin at all. They are asking for a licensing fee from the businesses that would make money from NY residents. This is way different than banning illegal drugs, CP etc. It is more like giving liqueur license or gun license. Service providers, who wants to serve NY residents are already attempting to be Bitlicensed, e.g. itBit, CoinBase, BitStamp, Gemini. Users of direct trading exchanges like LocalBitcoins.com, 100bit.co.in or PaxFul.com will still be able to trade with NY residents if they hold Bitlicense. So, your imagination that in future bitcoiners will rot in jail is baseless. Only those, who does not follow the law of the land will be in trouble. Hence, rather than being afraid, it is better to be educated.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:53:18
Nopes. I am not saying Coinffeine controls our bitcoin. It does not. The escrow holding our deposit is controlling the trade. Both parties need to trust him. On the other hand, in case of a dispute, that escrow needs to give the judgement on whether the FIAT payment has actually been made or not.
The problem here is that escrow is anonymous. The escrow can just be an alt of the buyer/seller. From that angle, the   or  escrow is much more trustworthy as they are serving an establishment and their reputation is their business. They can be identified and challenged in real world, which is not possible for anonymous escrows. 
As I said in another post, bitcoin's decentralization was successful because it was trust less. These so called decentralized exchanges are not at trust less. And whenever you need to trust someone, centralization works better.
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:09:02
Oops... Sorry... corrected.

Last one is the best one. It should be given a BIP for further discussion.
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:19:11
I have used 100bit.co.in. Smooth operation and good support. But, very low volume in my country. They probably need to advertise more. But, that is true for PaxFul as well. We need to give some time to these StartUps.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:39:11
You are confusing again. The problem is not with the bitcoin, but with the FIAT. Bitcoin is a programmable money and anything associated with it can be verified programmaticaly. But, if Bob pays 1$ to Alice and Alice denies the payment, how do you make the dispute resolution ? You have to have a point where human intervention comes in. You can push the boundary by using bitUSD, but that way you are bringing in the problem of trusting a centralized gateway. This problem can only be solved in a trust less way on a decentralized platform, if and only if FIAT can be transferred similar to bitcoin. But, the day it happens bitcoin will lose much of its glory. Here is the paradox.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:03:22
Have you tried  or  ? Those are the best for countries where there exist no stable exchange.

If you want to buy fast and without verification, then direct tradin exchanges like  and  are your best bet. 100bit.co.in charges 0.1%, whereas LocaBitcoins.com charges 1%.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:22:55
I have thoroughly studied both BitSquare.io and Coinffeine.com. They are not trust less at all. And if I have to trust, centralized ones are way better than anonymous escrows/gateways.

First  and now  None of them have been able to eradicate the dependency on anonymous escrows or centralized gateways. These are just variants of current centralized ones like   or  under the disguise of decentralization. Bitcoin's concept of decentralization worked because it was trust less by architecture. For these so called decentralized exchanges, we have to trust some common party... and there it fails. Sorry.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:02:08
Sorry to say, I'd prefer   or  over this type of WoT based exchange any day. These escrows will be anonymous and scams will be rampant. The trust system Coinffeine is no better than the DefaultTrust of BitcoinTalk.

1. Join  as 'other'.
2. Post a small buy order and mention about Namibian bank account in 'Payment Method' field. Best is if you can create an OKpay account and use that.
3. If someone shows interest in your buy order, first talk to him in communicator about his identity. Learn about how he wants to receive the fund.
4. If all goes well, move forward with the trade.
