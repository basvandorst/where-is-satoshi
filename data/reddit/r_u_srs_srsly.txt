Because it's a secret that people use to make others think we care more/less than we actually do. Revealing the principle negates that

Bitcoin was not created to subvert financial regulations. If you don't want to comply, don't hold bitcoins with a regulated organization. Coinbase exchanges bitcoins for USD, and therefore have to comply with USD regulations. 
If you want total privacy, obtain and spend bitcoins without converting to a regulated currency.

this has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with verifying your bank statements.  I sold a bunch of stuff on ebay before I moved across the country.  When I applied for a new mortgage, they made me provide all the ebay listings and paypal information.  Even then, I had a very large hurdle.  I imagine it would be 100 fold worse trying to get them to verify bitcoin transfers when, by design, there is no easy way to verify who sent you money (even if it was yourself) and more importantly, WHY they sent you money.

no you wouldnt.  
Thats easy to say when you have little or nothing.
Then you land a job making 100k.  If ONLY you made 200k/year you could get that really nice car you had your eye on.  Now, all your friends have big houses and you need one too, but then you need.  500k.  
Soon enough your net worth is in the millions, but most of your worth is in big physical assets things like your house, car(s), furnature, etc and your investments are paying out 50k/year, but you are re-investing those (presumably because they are good investments)
You really want to take your spouse on that vacation, so you really need 600k/year to cover since after taxes that 100k additional is really only 40k in your bank account.
Then you have kids.  Oh man you want better for them than what you had, so you start packing away a college fund in case they get into harvard, but that starts drying up your liquid funds.
Its a very slippery slope and anyone who says they wouldnt do it are ignoring the very well documented fact that almost everyone who comes into money immediately forgets your belief.  
Look at all the documentaries on lottery winners that blow it all in a few years.

Don't forget to take into account the political capital required to effect that type of change. 
Get an idea rolled out in a high school or undergraduate student government.

Probably because they're like cryptsy.  When you buy instant, they're probably giving you access to their pool that might be claimed by more than 1 person. Fractional reserve.  It's not like they keep a ton on hand. 
If they know you withdraw immediately then they might not want to play nice.

This sounds suspiciously like revisionist history. 
Everyone thought it could do something... it can't. 
Ok, so it was meant for 5-10 smart contracts a day. 
What is a smart contract, where can I read about it, and could I have examples of how I'd use smart contracts?

The people who use it are the people who need to use it.
The people who want to use it are a lot speculators who buy it, hold it, and try to get rich off it.

Capitalism says prices will equalize at exactly what consumers will pay for a product. I don't believe for a second that a 3% fluctuation has anything to do with cc processing. If protection wasn't a choice, sellers would still arrive on optimal pricing. 
The question at hand means in the real world today, the choice is same cost, protection or not. Of course a majority would take consumer protection.
In a hypothetical scenario where cc processing was free, I firmly believe prices would rise to whatever consumers are willing to pay and probably close that gap. 
I love the idea of bitcoin but I don't get the endgame. When it's as widespread as cc payments. You'll have to give 1-3% fee to the miners anyway for sub 60 sec confirms. Nothing wrong with that, just changes who cashes the check, banks or miners.   From the consumer side, no difference to me

"Fraud protection at no extra cost to you"... 
Good God man. His point was clear let's not argue semantics of "free"
You pay the same for yes fraud protection as you do for no protection. Stupid not to take it.
