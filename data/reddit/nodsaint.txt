You are clearly extremly new and you invested in bitcoin 1 week ago. You should begin with researching the basic and how to store and properly set up a safe account.
Binance and bittrex are the largest exchanges for trading amf binance being the most trusted at the time. 
Bittrex have a lot more cryptocurrency but faced issues before with withdraw problems and frozen accounts.
Kucoin is a new growing exchange based in Kong kong. Less liquidity but offer some benefits by holding KCS.

Very ignorant. This is not about getting fucked on MDMA and hoping it will cure.
Just like ketamine that have shown huge sucesss against depression. Its being researched and possible taking in controlled enviroments to further see if can benefit. Then draw consensus from that.

Never assume. If you only store btc and you do not trade then you should store your btc on an cold wallet. Simple enough to download a mobile wallet and to be assured you that are in control of your private key.

Takes away so much stress. During this bear trend I put my longterm in ledger nano and feels so much better. Also lost interest in trading but in return better sleep now.

Sure. You are arguing over a comment on a random person on Reddit. Comes of very insecure if you're so worried about what my economy is, a random person on the internet..

Catched the 7300$ bottom a few weeks ago. Went up. Then down again. Maybe this is the bottom but i think we will see a new low at 6400$. Hopefully not because now i made my other positions..

You right. It more or less what i going for in context to OP.  Formulated wrong. But you are correct.

Solid opinion with a lots of words with no meaning.
