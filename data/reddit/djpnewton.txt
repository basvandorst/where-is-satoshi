There is something strange about shipping out of the USA. I can get stuff from China, Thailand, Australia really cheaply, but anything from the USA is super expensive to ship.
The internal shipping in the US is cheap, getting the item from some warehouse to a port on a truck is cheap but then for some reason putting it on a ship bound internationally (which should be minor) shoots the price through the roof.

I said this yesterday but I guess I may as well repeat it here:
when the bitcoin network upgrades via a soft-fork all the rules that a legacy node signed up to when they decided to participate are still validated.
I do not remember anyone getting upset that previous soft fork protocol upgrades (P2SH, CTLV, CSV) were not implemented as a hard fork. Separate yourself from the block size debate for a moment and you should be able to see how disingenuous these arguments against soft forks are

I cant find and release notes or change log so this is from what I can scrounge up:
 - some sort of head first mining thing
 - 2mb hard fork code
 - then they removed the sigops limit in the hard fork (after being forked off testnet by BU)
 - then they replaced the 2mb hard fork with blocksizeacceptlimit and some sort of punishment factor to the blocks POW score if it is larger
 - flextrans (kinda, on testnet or something)

yes they will, but its not certain that they will and its a large risk that does not occur in a soft fork
@_date: 2016-01-27 23:03:42
One could infer from your statement that miners can unilaterally change the consensus rules (say increase the subsidy) and their (longest) chain determines bitcoin

Lightning constructs *bitcoin* transactions using specific *bitcoin* script to transact *bitcoins*, you could probably adapt it to litecoin but it is simply not true that you could replace the lower layer with something different if that lower layer does not contain the specific properties required

Its also bandwidth.
My node is uploading 500GB+ per month, much more bandwidth then this and then you need to host in a data center (less independent) so now you have to collocate (more expensive rack mount hardware + ~$100 per month) or rent a server (8TB disk not so cheap now)
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:52:45
Just because they can. Doesn't mean they will.
By the same logic we can do away with other consensus rules also ("miners can voluntarily limit the block subsidy so why do we need it coded in all nodes " - answer,  because then we would have to trust them)
@_date: 2016-01-27 07:03:16

Thats not very reassuring.
There will be a large number of SPV users not knowing what chain they are on (perhaps not even knowing about multiple chains).

If the economic nodes are in unison it will be a slam dunk for them (big if though)
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:29:45
In the event of a controversial hard fork there will be a large number of SPV users not knowing what chain they are on (perhaps not even knowing about multiple chains). These users could receive coins on the chain that ends up being worthless and as a result lose a lot of money.
A soft fork does not have the same property of putting all the risks on those who are ignorant or did not opt-in to the changes.
Its kind of ironic that widespread SPV usage has probably made it a lot harder to do a hard fork (especially one that is controversial).
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:14:53
You would need to add a new input to your transaction each time you do this which has a few problems:
 - it makes the txs larger each time you do it
 - your wallet may not have any spare unspent outputs to use
 - potentially leak a bit more privacy each time you add a new input

opt-in RBF keeps 0conf without the other drawbacks.
The biggest blow to 0conf is/will-be memory limits on mempools IMO. It used to be that one could (kinda) assume that a 0conf tx will stay in all the mining nodes mempools but since the spam attacks at the end of last year all the nodes have implemented memory limits to mempools which means your 0conf tx could have been evicted

Well I would add a qualifier.. should there be any changes to the protocol the longest chain (as validated by the economic majority) will probably be the winner
The problem is its hard to ascertain what the economic majority supports and a divisive split (50/50, 60/40, 75/25?) could result in double spends, disenfranchisement and a step backwards of legitimacy in regards to outside opinion

I do not know how the author makes the conclusion that a block size limit is premature optimization. If the network accepted large blocks and the blockchain got really big there is no easy way to undo that. There are certainly known bottlenecks that are being optimized all the time (signature validation, network protocol efficiency)


The author links to a spreadsheet that contains a poll of some mining pools a claims this is evidence of &gt;90% of the **community** supports at least 2MB blocks. Well, mining pool managers are a small fraction of the bitcoin community.


I would argue that centralization is a continuum (and a large blockchain add pressure towards the bad end of that continuum)






Maybe, core thinks that seqwit will be deployable in April. A rushed fork with false consensus (think SPV nodes not knowing what chain they are on) would be worse then waiting anyhow




God knows how big the blocks would need to be to support this stuff. 2MB blocks are a drop in the ocean compared.

surely you cannot reset bitgo limits using the same credentials that you use to request bitgo to co-sign transactions!
I would hope that they have a combination of:
  - a different/second-factor credential needed to change bitgo policy
  - a stand down period before bitgo policy can be relaxed (along with email alerts etc)

This is a point I have tried to make before too.
If 99% of the activity is speculation then another chain just gives more options for further speculation.
If you have real economic activity then another chain causes much chaos for all these users (crypto goldbugs, remittance, darknet markets, digital services, physical goods etc)

Slow down. The idea is to get your tx into a &gt;1MB classic block, then you sell your classic coins for fiat (which will not be recorded on the core blockchain)

They are valid coins according to the classic network (invalid to core network). Are you saying that nobody would take valid classic coins?

well I guess it isnt open source until they publish a repo
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:54:25
I dont really get it. So because they gave IP addresses a 32 bit number rather then 16 we should increase the max blocksize by 8 times and double it every other year?
There is no analysis of what the tradeoffs of 32 bit compared to 16 bit IPs or 8MB compared to 1MB blocks. The argument seems to be that one protocol has a big number and it worked out for them so this protocol (which is completely different) should have a big number too.
Has anyone tried reindexing the chain recently? It takes about 50 hours at 100% CPU
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:11:18

I keep seeing this kind of statement lately:
"its ok to make the max block size X because miners would never be stupid enough to actually publish a block with size X".
So if we dont expect or want miners to actually publish blocks of that size what is the point of raising the max block size to that level?

Changetip, exchanges... They all do offchain transactions (and take fees), are they an attack on miners profits?
@_date: 2011-11-11 03:03:12
true, but I dont think the op is making that claim
@_date: 2015-11-25 08:21:57
Yeah but I think its an apples to oranges comparison.
What was the implications of a 32 vs 16 bit IP address? Did it really have much of an effect on an individual node? Either way the vast majority of the traffic would be invisible to an individual node on a packet switched network.
The bitcoin network requires each node to validate and store each block for perpetuity so even a 1MB vs 2MB block has large implications for each individual node

Re 2). There has been 6 years of fees being negligible compared to the block subsidy but that will change
@_date: 2015-11-09 09:29:55
cool, I just looked it up there is about 55000x less hashrate on testnet

What is the focus of your hard fork proposal?

I would imagine that main bottleneck of HFT is network latency not CPU processing power

Gavin asked for the comparison:


What he asked for is pointless, because other protocols do not have the same requirements as a cryptocurrency
@_date: 2016-10-13 08:44:16
how would it work as an extension block?
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:22:28
It depends on what exactly changes in the hard fork.
the way segwit was implemented in elements alpha it changed the transaction format.
How would your segwit hard fork work?
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:11:50
in some ways mobile wallets might be safer then desktop due to sandboxing of processes... mind you the rate of smartphone vulnerabilities found vs the speed of (or lack of) security updates for mobile OS's is a factor too.
Hardware wallet support for bitcoin core would be a huge win

the longest **valid** chain, so if I am running bitcoin-core and the majority of testnet mining is building blocks on a chain with a &gt;1MB block in it then we could see two different "longest valid chains" from core and XTs perspective 
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:43:10
I have been trying to run a full node on a Raspberry Pi 2 but bitcoind keeps dying after a few hours I think because it runs out of memory. Do you have any special config? I havent turned on a swap drive because it is all flash.
@_date: 2016-10-09 21:17:59
they make the overall size of transactions smaller, which means we can fit more in each block
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:11:35
you still need to validate the entire blockchain, at least once
@_date: 2016-05-27 02:15:26
I think the two big holdouts are f2pool and antpool (although it did look like antpool was testing with CSV the other day)
@_date: 2016-10-16 17:35:55
Soft forks ;D
@_date: 2015-10-28 21:51:18


@_date: 2016-05-23 20:13:17
It would be very difficult to deploy as a hard fork. Not only would you need to upgrade all the full nodes at the same time but you would need to upgrade all the light weight clients at the same time too
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:43:15
if you have a fast network connection the bottleneck will probably be the blockchain verification. bitcoin core 0.12 might help with libsecp256k1-based ECDSA validation
@_date: 2015-10-22 02:52:13
I think fundamentally you might be right.
You could say the result of the recent transaction flooding is that the flawed assumptions around accepting 0conf are being weakened futher

a long position is generic in that the position could be leveraged (borrow x to buy y) or not (use owned x to buy y)

non-SPV could mean full node or other (see copay, airbitz, hive, mycelium etc)
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:12:48
err... double the current average fee
the block size will always be limited to some extent we need a market for block space what ever the block size ends up being

Ok, that makes sense
@_date: 2016-07-28 12:41:57
perhaps the height of a fee block could be based on the fee directly (not relative to other fees in that block), something like that might make it easier to quickly distinguish how expensive it is to get into one block vs another block
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:01:18
you cant help bootstrap others to verify the whole chain though if you have pruned your local blockchain
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:17:10
I guess I just dont see the case made that the Fed was a (or the) material difference
The slope of the red line is a lot steeper then one that is inflation adjusted so I guess you could credit the Fed for pumping up the s&amp;p 500 in that regard =)

@_date: 2016-07-21 08:41:32
are the tx links just to a representative transaction for each bucket?
are the fees shown cents/KB?
have you thought about making the blocks with empty space left justified?
@_date: 2016-07-04 23:05:53
I think it means they will be separated from the rest of the p2p network and will not receive newly mined blocks after the segwit soft fork activates

if you are an inside trader it might still be worth it
@_date: 2013-07-02 02:29:57
it does NOT defeat the purpose of Bitcoin because it is totally incidental to the blockchain just like gold ETFs do not stop people from holding physical gold

The Babysitting coop is often touted as an example that shows the value of an expanding moneytary supply.. it also can be argued that the problem was not with a fixed money supply but with price fixing as the rule was one token = 1/2 an hour of babysitting.
