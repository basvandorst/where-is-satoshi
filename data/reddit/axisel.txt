bitcoin.com / rogerver/ r/btc
- all time speaking about bitcoin core (bitcoin core doesn't exist, it's BITCOIN, bitcoin core is an application) is old bitcoin and bitcoin cash is new bitcoin , not bcash
- speak all time about fee, and yes at this time we got high fee, but bcash is a empty trunk who claim to be 10000000x faster et low fee than bitcoin (just wait segwit adoption + LN)
- They create bitcoin wallet with bcash by default , all user trust this is bitcoin , they finally send bitcoin to bcash and lose all.
P.S: u just have to understand Bcash is altcoin scam.

To move your BiTCoin in safe wallet ur own:
1a) Create offline wallet with tails usb stick (electrum is in) , and keep seed on paper (never on electronical device if u want security) and use master key to readonly wallet on android / pc electrum
2b) buy hardware wallet (format it before use, if paranoia)
3)Move before in gdax (to get no transfer fees)
4)Transfer from gdax to receive addresses of your read-only wallet 
Finally: Seed is everything, lose it so u lose bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:24:58
Gdax is trading soft owned by basecoih , u can make order to buy/sell without fee.
If u got btc on gdax wallet u can transfert to your personnal wallet without fees

Download tails , install on usb stick , boot on tails off internet.
Create new electrum wallet write seed on paper, scan/copy master pub key on your electrum wallet phone to read only.
Send bitcoin to gdax and send gdax to your wallet (no fees) to receive adresse from electrum phone wallet.
