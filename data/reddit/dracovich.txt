I don't think it's necessary to be cynical.
The way i see it scaling of bitcoin cannot be reached without reaching decentralization at some poinst.
BCH Gets decentralizeddue to the full nodes requiring both more network capacity and storage capacity which not everyone can/wants to commit resources to, BTC/LN would get more decentralized as the there would most likely be large centralized LN hubs around since you need to tie down sizable amounts of BTC in keeping channels open, which few can/want to do. Either way there's a degree of centralization.
Neither solution is perfect and i don't think anyone has a suggestion on how to scale bitcoin without decentralizing it at some touch point. I just wish there wasn't so much vitriol between the two sides, as it would seem to me that the two solutions would be fine as a combined solution, moderate block sizes increases for short/medium term, and LN for large scale adoption scenarios.

I haven't been following the news super closely, but as far as I can tell they bullied through a continuation of the capital controls yesterday and it's even tighter than before, closing a fwe loopholes companies were using.
Edit: Nevermind looks like i completely misread it, it was in fact the opposite, a bill to lift the controls was pushed through quickly.

I'm a little confused, i asked this question in the other thread, but it's 4 days old so i doubt anyone will answer.
How many stores are we talking about? [In this comment]( the CTO (or so he claims) of Pademobile says:




But surely 7-eleven and those other stores have more than 50 physical stores? According to the [Wikipedia page on 7-eleven Mexico]( there are over 1500 stores?

You say everybody, but isn't that just confirmation bias from hanging out in places where bitcoin news is widely discussed? How many people follow these day to day things? Today is the first i've heard about this, and if i wasn't on reddit i wouldn't have a clue. I have some friends taht have BTC in MtGox and they had no idea what was going on.
Most people are probably justs keeping them there thinking "I'll come back to it when it's time to sell", so as long as they fix the problem reasonably fast, i'd wager that the vast majority ofa ccounts have no idea there was ever a problem.

well he started with 100$, so i doubt he's financially devestated by it in that way. But still, having 200.000$ basically disappear into thin air is discouraging regardless.

Hmm ok, i just read around a bit, doesn't seem as hard as it originally looked. First guide i found was a 15 step guide including unplugging and loading a liveCD version of linux to do the deed.
I don't doubt it's very safe, but seems impractical for use by general public. The blockchain.info tutorial ( seems fairly do-able (if only apple had the blockchain app still ;_; )

@_date: 2014-04-13 19:43:06
I don't think merchants feel the same way, cancelling your payment method is not the same as cancelling your subscription. 
Depending on the product it can be easy to just not ship a product if they cancel the payment, but i know for gym owners etc it can be a hassle to have to synchronize payments with gym memberships, that's why they specifically stipulate that a cancellation of payment is not th same as cancellation of membership (same with mobile phone bills etc). If you cancel only your payment, then you're just skipping the bill, not cancelling the membership, and they can send you the bill physically and are in their right to demand payment.

Powerful bitcoins
@_date: 2014-05-21 07:32:22
Yeah i have tried looking at localbitcoins (looking for local merchants that would take a simple bank transfer). But they usually only have a very small volume, and a price 15-20% higher then the exchanges :/
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:50:08
Hey i'm not defending mtgox, 80% of my bitcoins are there and i'll be devestated if they're lost.
But i don't agree, why should a big-fish be able to get his money out and not me? Why is the 250BTC guy getting special treatment with manuel withdrawals while i'm being told to go fuck myself, because i don't have the money and time to go protest in Japan? 
They have to treat everyone the same.
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:34:41
yeah it's really weird, it's like people feel better with a $ number on their mtgox account as opposed to a BTC, even though they can't touch either at the moment, and if anything is getting out, it's the bitcoins, not money.
You'd think it'd go the other way, those with bitcoin don't want to deal with fiat withdrawals, so noone wants to sell their BTC on gox.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:23:49
Damn, i had money stuck on mtgox, figured i might as well buy at 450$ (when this was 60% of the price of other exchanges) and hope they weren't insolvent. Now i'm sad i didn't wait, at least then i'd be in for a nice influx of btc if i ever get it out.
@_date: 2014-11-19 08:20:23

Seems like an overstatement, one of the selling points of bitcoin is fast easy transactions are they not? If apple nails this and gives you fast easy digital transactions everywhere, why doesn't that take away from bitcoin?
Seems like what bitcoin really needs now is user adoption, there's plenty of new merchants and startups, but isn't the price stability right now because the number of bitcoin users is staying fairly stable? Seems to me that if apple pay takes off (and doesn't offer bitcoin as a payment method), there's a lot of ordinary joes that see no real reason to try out bitcoin as a payment method.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:08:33
Wouldn't say greed, just didn't know any better.
Bought and kept it there, i just kind of assumed that it was a "real" bitcoin wallet and they were just a user-interface for it (that's how blockchain.info works right?).
Wasn't until i started hearing rumblings and subscribed here that i saw how it really was. The snarky and holier than thou comments on this subreddit sure aren't helping.

I would love to see AliBaba start doing escrow and payments etc through bitcoin.
Currently most of the countries that people deal with through AliBaba don't  have PayPal (Pakistan for example), and one of the main issues with AliBaba is getting defrauded. 
So today you send international bank transfers, and soemtimes western union in order to get samples and pay for large orders (which takes days to complete, and you have no recourse if you got scammed).

I'm a pleb more or less, so i've probably misunderstood how blockchain.info works, but it was my understanding that blockchain was a "real" wallet that i myself held control over (unlike MtGox and other exchanges?).
I had thought that blockchain could not move money out of my wallet without my password, and even if blockchain went bankrupt i'd still have access to my wallet? Have i complete misunderstood this?
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:28:37
not really, it was just non-thinking on my part, so i guess he's right on the stupidity part heh.
I guess i just took the high ranking, mtgox being used as the pricing index etc as meaning they were a reliable and trusted source. Then with the general reading i had done on bitcoin i just kind of assumed that mtgox was a similar setup to blockchain, and thought nothing more of it.
I should of course have followed up and been more vigilant, but i guess i just kinda bought them and decided to hang on to them long term, so i didn't really think much about it after buying them initially.

Depends on what the account is meant for.
Is he asking for credit? Sure, then they're fine with not giving him anything, unless you have a proven business with a stable income, a bank will probably not give you credit, unless you back it up personally.
If he's literally just asking for a bank account and a card, i don't see the risk for the bank. He can only spend what he deposits.
@_date: 2014-06-12 06:46:08
I believe that you only need to be approved (or at least pay sponsor tax) if you¨re either a:
1) Supplement company.
2) Clothing company.
Look at "Dynamic fastener" that seems to be supporting veeryone, it¨s just a random bolt company whose owner loves UFC, and it's cheap for him to throw a few hundred after fighters here and there since he doesn't hvae to pay the tax.

I completely sympathize, and i'm glad that someone is protesting (and hopefully thereby putting more pressure on them, putting a human face on it all) but it's still disingenous to tell him that he could just pay out right there.
While that is technically true, they obviously don't have the manpower to manually transmit bitcoins to everyone that wants them, and if they started doing it for anyone who shows up physically, just because they're being more of a nuisance than other customers, then they are being unfair to those that do not have the monetary means to do that.

Honestly this attitude is a bit annoying, this is assuming someone has followed bitcoins for years.

@_date: 2014-04-28 12:53:12
I was gonna suggest this.
UFC fighters are starved for sponsorship money, since the businesses that would benefit the most from it (Clothing and supplement companies) are forced to pay a huge "UFC Tax" if they want to be allowed to sponsor a fighter (tends of thousands of dollars).
A fwe hundred dollars would probably get us on the ass of an undercard fighter.

I think any kind of adoption in stable countries will be difficult. There needs to be a compelling reason to get into bitcoins (aside from the investment aspect), and for a normal person there really aren't many compelling ones. As much as this subreddit rails against fiat currencies, their points don't hit home with a normal person, they just don't care, and have no onus to make an effort to switch.
Seems to be, the real adoption needs to happen first in places where bitcoin genuinely is better and there is a real compelling reason to use it, like in the case of third world countries that don't have access to banking, and don't have a stable currency (not that bitcoin is crazys table, but probably more so than the old zimbabwe dollars etc). Remittance is another part where it seems like bitcoin could be a big player, but i don't see the initial takeoff happening in the west tbh, westerners buying into it are going to be idealists and those looking to make money.
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:02:44

Will depend on the country, i think most countries treat it the same way you would stocks.
Some don't, i live in Denmark and here they issued a statement that gains from bitcoin would not be taxed (and conversely losses can't be deducted).
Edit: Some had asked me for a source on this:
Here's an article from a reputable newspaper in Denmark:
They basically say gains made for a private person due to bitcoin price changes are not taxable, BUT if you are playing the market (day-trading etc) with an eye on making a profit, it should be claimed on your taxes.
They compare it to a person selling a painting that's been sitting in their apartment and gained value (which would not be subject to taxing).

so if you were showing the NASA budget as a % of the total government spending in USA, would you think it was correct to show it on a 0-100% scale? it would be completely invisible and not seem like much has changed, and it would not tell the story of NASAs budget.
See the wikipedia entry for NASA budget to see how it's displayed there (
You scale your graphs to show the story you're trying to tell with the graph, it should of course not be deceiving, as you often see with election bar cahrts (zooming in ont he top part to make it look like there's a significant difference between two parties), but in this case this is actually the correct scale to use.

I'd love to hear from someoen who has actually tested this, it was all over the news a few years ago that it wouldn't be taxable as long as it wasn't speculative buying.
Most would interpret that as "day trading = income, need to tax that, holding = no tax", but it's always up the the interpretation of tha tax agency, so i'd love to see if someone has actually tested the waters yet.

I'm holding, i initially bought at 100$, and still believe in bitcoins in general, the failure of mtgox is not a failure of bitcoin as i see it, but rather an individual.

I'm watching his first video, and his bit about insurance seems like someone who does not understand that business at all, it'll be close to impossible to do. Insurance is a lot more than just a simple middleman that holds the money.
I don't doubt that you can create a program to take money from everyone who pays in, and then pay out given a certain clause is met, BUT:
What happens if you find out that the one dollar from one million people isn't enough to cover all claims? Who decided that it was just one dollar they had to pay? Now you underpaid on your insurance, which means the pool of money to pay out is underfunded, and whoever has a claim last will get shit all.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:27:59
Heh no this was just myself deciding :) I've had some skin in the game myself (bought shortly after the May crash), just hadn't been a good plugin out there, and then I needed to upgrade both my art software, wordpress and subsequently my theme in order to get all my ducks in a row, so it took me a while :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:08:39
True enough, i'll definately look into it.
I guess I hadn't thought much about it since i'm in a rather fortunate situation. MtGox transfers aren't that difficult for me, my bank lets me do them through my netbanking and takes a couple of days, and if i'm in a pinch BitCoinNordic accepts local bank transfers for same day purchases (albeit at a rather hefty 4.9% fee).

Noted, what is the standard discount here? Some if the numbers I see browsing through the subreddit seem more based on speculating on the future value than cost savings, both my creditcard and paypal fees probably don't amount to much more than ~3-4%
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:51:03
Thanks :)
It should be at the very bottom of the checkout page (after you input your shipping information). There are 3 payment options at the very bottom of the page:
* Creditcard (should be the default)
* PayPal
* Bitcoins
You don't get the actual payment information (wallet address and QR code) until you've placed the order. It should use a weighted average of MtGox value to calculate from euros to bitcoins.
Out of curiosity, for the purpose of potential future changes to the website in order to make it more user friendly, where would you have expected to see the payment option?
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:14:24
Right, but then it's no longer about actual costs, but about speculation as to future market caps no?
I'm not opposed to that either, but just to be clear that then we're not talking about the saved costs due to using a non-centralized currency.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:52:10
Well i guess it's kind of cheating since it's being posted to such a bitcoin friendly crowd, but it feels great to already have the first sale in bitcoins only 1 hour after launching :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:04:27
Of course, deliver to the whole world and only charge cost for shipping. I'm located in Denmark so it's quite close (and i know how much it sucks when USA businesses don't ship or charge huge amounts to ship to Europe).
