Hostels primarily and some restaurants.

USD is the most ubiquitous currency in the globe. Go to Cambodia, withdraw from an ATM, you get USD. Many more examples.

I'll buy your house for 2 dollars

Nope, my comment was pertinent. Yours wasn't.

Yea thats why I said wait for it to bottom out lol. It is just way to volatile to predict right now. But in my opinion its going to end up around like 7800 usd or so so theres still time to salvage something. Tether all alts now and wait for this to end.

That's irrelevant to this thread.

you sound like an asshole

In discussing the merits of fiat and cryptocurrency, it is not. Essentially every country has their own exclusive currency that residents would pay taxes in except the Euro. So I guess no currency is generally accepted. You're being silly. Pointless to continue.

Reposition. It's clearly going to go under 10k tonight. Sell now, let it bottom out, when the dust settles around 6 or 7 or 8k, buy back in. Silly to just sit there when it is quite clearly going down. I sold at 12,4 once final support seemed to break and I plan to buy back in eventually. Might as well accumulate more btc out of this whole debacle.

I have travelled and lived all over the globe. USD is the most commonly accepted currency in the globe. I have paid for goods and services with USD in Asia, Africa, Europe, South America, Central and North America.

You are right, Europe is less commonly accepting of USD, which does nothing to mitigate my point that USD comparatively is the most ubiquitous currency today. Europe is not the Earth. Of course you can't pay with USD everywhere. But comparatively, USD is the most wide spread and accepted and anyone that has travelled knows this is true. Anyone. I take it you have not.

You're an idiot lol. My guess is you are the one who has never left your country. Anyone that's travelled extensively keeps USD with them, regardless of where they come from. You'll see Australians in Colombia with wads of USD, Germans in the Philippines with USD, etc etc. You're just being petty because you got called out for saying something dumb and you have no real way of justifying it. If you've ever travelled, you would know USD is a generally accepted currency. Something in Cambodia costs 8000 riel? Give em 2 USD and go on about your day. They prefer it. In fact, most prices are listed primarily in USD all over the country.

We both know paying taxes is not what was meant by "generally accepted". If you can go pay for a good or a service with USD, it's generally accepted. You can do that in more places globally with USD than any other currency at this point.

This definitely isn't over lol
