I thought there could only ever be 21M BTC?

Define mediocre

It wasn't lost though it was in a savings account. The system sounds like it ends up with far more "lost" money than there otherwise would be without the retarded system. I assume what you mean by 'poof' is the bank could go bust. In the UK we have the FSCS which covers you up to 85k per bank to stop this happening. Nothing like that in the US?

Ah thanks for explaining, I didn't think about the negatives. I've seen that happen myself now I come to think about it where someone has left their account with a negative balance for a number of years and are still being charged debit interest

What the fuck? The bank just sends your money to the state after less than 2 years in the US? What about the interest it was supposed to be accruing? As someone from the UK this is horrifying.

I work for a bank and my first thought was how many old people I get with tens if not hundreds of thousands in savings that have been sat there for 5-10 years often forgot about (or at least which bank the money was with). I feel like we'd get a lot more complaints if I regularly had to tell people we'd given their money away cause they weren't using it. Isn't that the point of a savings account??

Then why move it in the first place you know? At least let it accrue interest in the bank

Damn you coulda bought 5 of em a year ago

Why would it ever, EVER be the states money? And what's the point in removing it from the savings account if you can ask for it back at any time? Doesn't that mean the state can't use the money as they technically don't own the capital?

Big oof

What a retarded argument. There's plenty of things out there that everyone said wasn't going to work, and actually didn't work you know.

At least at the bank I work for, we are unable to disable the security system that blocks transactions that are deemed "unusual", even if you call to let us know a transaction will be attempted. The system does stop a lot of actual fraud from happening though so your embarrassment is probably better than someone actually stealing $5000 from your account.
