Hey glurp_glurp_glurp,
we have updated the website and UI, the message should be a bit more explanatory and will also provide a link to our community-centric view.
Please have a look at 
Thanks, Marcel

thanks for your interest. As the Bitcoin Seismograph uses APIs from third parties like blockchain.info, we have to respect the API limits which prohibits real-time data.
We are currently working on crawling data from the blockchain itself, so the block numbers should more precise than they are at the moment

Hey glurp_glurp_glurp,
thanks for your comment, we use statistical analysis to see if some value move outside of expected values. For example, the volatility of 30 and 60 days is quite high at the moment due to market developments. Nevertheless, these calculation are based on assumptions due to missing data and we hope to improve them by your feedback (Maybe a volatility of 20% for 30 days is not a problem for Bitcoin...).
But we will see your comment also as a feedback that we have to improve transporting the message.

thanks for your comments. The tool does some statistical analysis and returns some warning and alert levels based on the calculations. At the moment, the tool returns the alert modus as the volatility 30d/60d is quite high and above our estimated warning level.
Please see, that these warning and alert levels are assumptions due to missing data, but we hope to improve that based on your feedback. So, if you have an idea for better warning and alert level, I would love to hear / read them.
There is also a community-centric view, which also presents community contribution from bitcointalk and forum.bitcoin.org, please have a look. The switch is on the upper right corner of the website.
Thanks, I appricate your comments

Hey memoized,
I see what you mean and you are right, this is misleading. We will fix that on our next patch.
Thanks for your comment. May I ask you if you find the overall idea of the website promising or helpful for monitoring the Bitcoin community.
Thanks again for your comment, Marcel
