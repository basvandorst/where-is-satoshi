I bet a significant amount of tickets are due to newby mistakes which could be slowing them down in general, not all of these delays are due to that though, some people have been waiting on significant amounts of money for months at times..

as the mining centralizes the distribution also centralizes, not saying I agree with either side but distribution is going to be once sided either way.  In the case of bitcoin the most new coins are going to the individuals with enough tech know how to have created a large and efficient enough way to mine.  Are these the people who should be getting all the bitcoin?  I dont know, I dont think anyone knows, but how else are we going to distribute them?  Proof of stake can also be centralized.

Indeed, and if the price goes up miners will have a small window where they are making a lot more money(and selling less bitcoin) but that will again equalize when more miners come on to the network increasing difficulty.

But the U.S. is at war, multiple wars


Hence, Germany needed infinite amount of Papiermark to pay off the debt (the more they print, the less valuable it gets, thus it just cannot buy the required amount of gold), while USA needs finite amount of USD to pay off its debt.
Is that the only way country can bring hyperinflation to itself?  What is your opinion on the other [56 countries that have had hyperinflationary events?] (

A war by its nature is not in either parties control.  If one side had control there would be no war, but I see your point and what I am getting from you is that America is doing everything right when it comes to war and financial policy and they will continue to do the right things, and a hyperinflationary event is not even worth considering.

What is your opinion on monetary policy?  Do you think the fed is correct in increasing the money supply by two percent every year?  If you do the math 2% a year is a really high number, what will be the accumulated inflation rate after 20, 50, 100 years?  Do you think that monetary policy could be better or that the fed has reached some sort of financial nirvana?

The thing about exchanges though is that they usually require some sort of personally identifying information in order to comply with the standard kyc/aml laws in the US.  Shapeshift however, would be a good choice for using VPN and or Tor, but I don't think they exchange to fiat.

just because they don't explicitly state the fee, there is probably a small fee they take through arbitrage.  When I am looking to purchase, I compare coinbase and circle and they are pennies away from each other usually, coinbase explicitly states that they charge a 1% fee.
