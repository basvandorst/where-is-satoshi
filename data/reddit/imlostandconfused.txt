Yes it is. Without taxes, everyone would have to pay for their children's education privately. Roads wouldn't be maintained. People would die of starvation and exposure to the elements regularly. If taxes weren't paid most of the country would become like the third world. So you're basically incredibly selfish.

Wow. And that's why nobody put you in charge of the world.

Lmao the irony

So imagine a family can't afford the thousands a year to send their child to school? That kid just gets no education? That's okay with you?

You're selfish as fuck.

The problem is that not everyone would be able to afford to fund their child's education. So how do we tell those children that sorry, you're not allowed an education or any chance at a good career? 
I understand you're probably imagining a far more equal world, without such crippling inequality but I don't think that's realistic. 
I grew up working class so obviously I'm concerned about what would happen to my community if taxes disappeared. And before you say it, nearly everyone works. But they are barely getting by despite working full time. 
Sorry, I didn't realise you were Brazilian. I'm from England and we have tax funded medical care so most people are pretty supporting of taxation. Without it, people die or go bankrupt.

Most American husbands ain't shit either. 
I'm pretty sure the guys at MGTOW would be horrified at the idea of marrying a prostitute.

Maybe American men should marry each-other since they're so wonderful and perfect.
