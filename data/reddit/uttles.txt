I agree. Insider trading is a non crime. FYI - congress also agrees. They exempt themselves from insider trading laws

Screw you politics, we don't want any!

Ah, thanks. I googled those. It's too bad, I think this would make online shopping and the ever-elusive micropayment model work a lot better. Oh well.

The downvotes here are pretty disappointing. I was looking for an educational discussion, not sure why that is something that should be buried. But this is reddit

You know, this is fitting. Porn has driven huge technological changes, so here we go again with Bitcoin.

That's the entire idea of Bitcoin, yes. I'm talking about something that uses the underlying technology of Bitcoin to use USD and make transactions less expensive.

Good deal. I'll update this when I receive them. Thanks!

that's pretty amazingly huge. Are there any alternative wallets?

I appreciate your responsiveness today. It has been great. Now I just hope I get the shirts.

Yep, I think MtGox made a mistake today. I'm sure the value of BTC is still around $150 or so and will be when people resume trading on a large scale.

Update: Just got a shipping email from USPS. So, hopefully these shirts will be arriving soon!
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:53:44
Not a bad idea. Sounds like a good project for @_date: 2013-11-14 19:01:22
Ah! You're here! I actually was in email contact with you about it, but haven't heard anything from you in weeks. Email issue? I just forwarded the latest email to sales

Update: got the shirts today, they look great!

You're right, this "bubble" is an inverse reaction to the perpetual inflationary policies of the world's central banks. Fed, IMF, EU, whatever. I'm sure there will be fluctuations, corrections, etc, but I doubt it's going to go "pop."
