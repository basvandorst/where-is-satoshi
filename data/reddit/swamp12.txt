My laptop wasn't hacked. Someone was able to gain access to my account from a bug in the password reset system. After I no longer ran the site. Just saying...

We understand why they added partial payments. I just don't think it belongs in the core protocol. It just leads to a more complicated system and thus issues like justcoin had.

(jed from stellar here) 
Just want to help fill in a few points since I know the paper is heavy reading and I've been pouring over it for a while now:) 
"but it could work if things stay well connected - otherwise you could get islands or weakly connected parts of the network with a different view of the world"
You can see the trust graph of the whole network since every validating node broadcasts its quorum slice. This means people will be able to tell if there are vulnerable places in the graph or if a split is even possible. When this is noticed it is very easy to correct.
In practice with Bitcoin you are also trusting a small group of individual entities since mining has become so centralized. Trust is automatically goes to whomever has the most mining power. You don't get to pick them. So if, as you hypothesized above, a couple are compromised or coerced by governments, Bitcoin won't be able to route around the issue. 
There are certainly tradeoffs. We think each system is useful for different things. Stellar could be a useful way that people trade bitcoin for other currencies. And yeah clearly there is a ways to go with developing these decentralized protocols. Decentralized systems are hard and the cryptocurrency world hasn’t even gotten to the difficulties ahead of scaling to handle transaction volumes at the level of the likes of Visa.

That is the old stellar code. This blog post is announcing our new code base which is completely new.

The trust discussed in the paper isn't about trusting people with credit or loans or anything like that. It is that each node (which may be people or entities) chooses other nodes it believes won't withhold transactions from the network.

Does it also require mining?

there is no forex fee. they use the same exchange rate for deposit as withdrawal.

This isn't a clone of ripple. It is a completely new codebase

This is wrong. If this was the case the volume would be high. but it is very low. The market is flat because not everyone has reclaimed their account.
Also even if this was the case this would *help* new users. People trying to make money from really small movements reduce the spread which is good for everyone.

"trust" here just means that you trust them not to collude. You can actually know that all the nodes in your "trusted" set are dishonest but as long as they don't all collude with each other to cheat you, you are fine.

The exchange works. There will be an automated give away started next week I've been told. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:51:29
you don't have to trust anyone to use ripple.
@_date: 2013-02-09 05:59:55
yeah that is basically correct. You can trade USD/USD it just isn't possible in the client yet.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:10:50
Yes if you use xrp there is no trust. If you use gateways there is no more trust than the current financial system or the system of Bitcoin exchanges.

rather than switch to another centralized exchange switch to a decentralized one: [ripple.com](
