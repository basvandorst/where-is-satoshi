Bring back the term comedienne Trudeau.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:47:27
What nonsense.  
Metcalfe's (rather naive) Law emphasises the importance of early growth networks, and their dominance and inertia.  So BTC is easily the strongest and best placed currency according to Metcalfe.
And a doubly dodgy pseudo-maths post, as the 'true' value isn't even posited.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:56:16
Hmm, yesterday you wrote on Reddit that you had earned 10k from crypto.  
So run that past me again - I'm confused:  is it a good, or a bad investment?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:22:40
Look at my name.
I am one of Ver's poorly disguised sock puppets gone rogue  :)

Meanwhile, over in the naughty corner:
- Bcash perilously close to declining further to ฿0.09
- Bcash is hard-forking itself to a 32MB block size, even though its volumes are now so poor it doesn't even need 1MB.
- There could potentially be 2 versions of Bcash after their self-imposed and silly fork.  Let's call them Bcash Core and Bcash Cash.

Only one exchange - stand by..  30 mins max.

That's my kind of TA too.
Pumpy wumpy.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:01:55
Bitter hey?  Amateur economist who didn't buy at the right time?
Despite the 'crash' you keep bitterly commenting on, my crypto-portfolio is up 1200% since I invested.
It's not too late to buy; do you really want your nose pressed up to the window looking in all your life?
Ho ho.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:50:05
Here's a clue: 3rd by market cap.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:18:16
Yeah, but he can't do that forever.
I suppose it could only be good news for hodlers/relatively early adopters like myself.  Which is a bit selfish I suppose.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:07:09
Buy Monero?
(Not shilling - I'm 80% BTC)
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:28:12
Shit.  You're right!
I'm only up 1100%
I need to invest somewhere else.

I like to take a break by watching the clothes go round in my washing machine.

@_date: 2018-04-06 16:06:12
Shit.  Thanks for the heads-up.  
Selling all right now.
Cheers mate - I will never forget your kindness.
Love and kisses.
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:31:12
Are they?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:03:11
Yeah.  It still bugs me, but maybe time to forget.
Forgive me if I post something every once in a while to subdue my anger.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:36:08
As Ver knows, 'to love oneself is the beginning of a life-long relationship.'
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:24:47
Pump has started..
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:21:21
Stand by..
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:54:05
Yikes.  Never seen that before.  
It is inconceivable that the sine wave in the volume with near constant period is natural.  Well spotted.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:24:48
Next question:
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:31:20
Yes.  
Big green dildo = good
Big red dildo = bad
But allegedly there are complexities surrounding this.
I apply the following terms in my trading analyses:
* Pumpy wumpy
* to the Moon!!
* this looks very bad
* good for Bitcoin
* anyone know a good colorectal surgeon?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:04:38
I hate to say this, but this could be very good for adoption and price.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:37:34
I am actually one of Ver's sock puppet bots that went rogue.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:01:36
This Soros news, if true, will cause a small to medium pump.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:54:09
How about you use commas, or nothing, rather than decimal points?
Last check BTC was worth more than 6 dollars.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:50:40
Have these frauds tested this properly?
And why don't they just make the block size a fucking Terabyte and get it done with :)
Ho ho.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:09:25
If you need to recoup some losses, stand by.
I don't care personally, I just hodl.
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:07:19
But when is this 'tax day' in the USA?  I thought that would be 1 April.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:04:53
No.  It can't short forever.  There are checks and balances even in finance.  Just hold if you can, and all will be fine.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:55:01
This man has embarked upon a desperate charm offensive.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:40:42
Had I sold, I may have spent the money.  
And then I wouldn't own BTC which will be worth far more in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:25:55
You said 5 figures, now you've edited it to 1000 USD.  
But you have also written elsewhere you earned 10k from crypto - which really is 5 figures.
So you've been doing pretty well?
I'm doubly confused now.  BS
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:48:32
All bought at 600 USD.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:58:25
You forget that TA is a science, not an art.  
What you mean is:
* it may move sideways
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:34:59
Heh.  
- A shitcoin because it is dishonest and has no new technology to offer.  It is also highly centralised and effectively a business.
- No 3 because it was given away to every BTC holder.
- There's a lot of them in circulation, so of course exchanges list it.  But some exchanges are dropping support for Bcash pairs.
- Not millions buying it - nowhere near.  Look at the volume and do the math.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:29:53
Yes, but they need to be used cautiously in print.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:09:41
Now 9.2%
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:06:32
It is not well known.
If it is substantiated, there will be quite a big pump.
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:20:17
Anyone fancy a beer?
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:38:30
It's about time somebody forked Btrash to produce a scam version of that scam coin.
Just take its current blocksize and quadruple it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:12:39
Btrash is now *eighth* by trading volume.  They don't need this block size increase; pure hubris.
.. and ฿0.093 at time of writing.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:12:53
This is not the beginning of the end, gentlemen.
This is the end of the beginning.
Stand by.
