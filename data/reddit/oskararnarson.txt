Except of course for the fact that this is a computer generated image.

I wish you could indulge me and take a peak and bypass the FUD. Know that all the stuff you're reading about XRP or Ripple the company, is from someone who doesn't want it to succeed. Just bear that in mind. That's all I ask.

Ahh... I see what you mean.... But... it's not though :-D

Many XRP community members are people who were previously on your side but looked beyond the FUD and saw what's really going on.  
Honestly though, I was trying not to get into this same old fight. And I know you won't read anything I send you. So why are we even fighting?  
Is there a world where you can accept something about XRP from an XRP investor? Because there's a world where I can accept a fact about BTC from BTC investor. I think, rather than throw rocks at each other, the communities would benefit from a truce. Even if just for a designated time.

Step 1: Let's try not to argue.  
Step 2: Both communities empathize with each other's point of views. We all have FUD beliefs about each other, that are sometimes obsolete falsehoods, many years old that have been debunked since. This is true for both XRP and BTC.
I think if both communities would join hands, we could make a much bigger impact and speed up the adoption for crypto as a whole. There's so much energy that goes into fighting between these communities, despite playing the same sport. And it never goes anywhere. But that's just my opinion. I'm curious to hear from others.
This is where I'm at today in terms of utility:
Digital gold = BTC  
Cross border payments = XRP
Both can be successful, simultaneously. And I want both of them to be.

Hahah well, you went straight to the fight. I would argue you're completely misinformed but let's not even go there. I see both assets having a great future. I just think we could get there much quicker if people stopped the fighting. In the end it's all about crypto and solving problems.

Fair enough, I can respect that.

It's not though :-) Ciao.

Known scam. The police in Iceland issued out a warning because a LOT of Icelanders are getting that mail.
