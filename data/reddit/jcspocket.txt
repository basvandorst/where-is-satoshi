So in the world we are talking about 1 month ago when the price was $160 if you had invested in it you would now be defaulting on your loan and ruining your credit ?
Try this out for condescending: you're too scared to make the right choice and it makes you angry when they are successful for having the guts to believe in a new technology.
Let's look at the price in another month shall we.
I think even you know it's about to double.

 "it doesn't matter what things cost it matters how much you can buy"
If we all get paid 100k per week but milk cost $10k per gallon we can only buy 10 gallons a week.
If we all get paid 3 million per week and milk cost 100k per gallon even though the milk cost more I can still buy lots more of it.

No, actually it will increase tremendously just by being used as a financial product traded in various ways while continuing to be a store of value for increasingly larger amounts of capital.  One trillion is extremely conservative market cap.

The only way this argument makes sense is if you never buy coffee.
Today I can take the price of coffee and easily buy Bitcoin with it on a whim.
So someone could say that anyone who buys coffee is wasting value they could have spent on bitcoin.
Except for I like to have my cake and eat it too so I think I'll have my Bitcoin and I'll also drink coffee.

he would have been fine if he did static backup close unless they were bad actors who were specifically running custom client just incase to cheat him...its not like you get a popup that says "hey this guy is trying to close should we try to rob him?"
reality is those clients would have just co-op closed and he wouldnt be out any money
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:51:35
There are many services currently doing this, im not sure if its atomic or not but even if not youre only risking 1 channel at a time and only if you lose your data within the 1 second a transaction is happening.
There is also a static channel backup which I use that is able to request close and does not require perfect state...but if they refuse to close will get you in trouble
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:53:22
He did everything in the worst way possible.  Very reckless for this amount of money.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:36:35
I'm not talking about people buying bananas.  Trading it as a financial product makes it worth trillions combined with the store of value.
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:24:18
So you think normie will never coop close?
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:02:01
To be clear this guy handled things in the worst way possible.  I use static channel backups which to users nodes looks like just a normal channel close which would be approved 99% of the time.  Unless a user makes a custom malicious client he would have been fine with simple static backup.
For more protection and less trust there are scripts that keep channel state backed up in real time as it changes.  For someone with 40k this should have been done.
What you DONT DO is carelessly force close every channel when you're not even sure your state is correct.  Throwing caution in the wind its literally the worst thing you could do.
For the record I stalked you a bit before replying to make sure you're not an altcoiner kicking up dust.  Youre actually a really good person.

@_date: 2019-10-23 11:32:51
Backup is very possible. There are scripts you can run its not accurate to say the backup is old "every second"
It just needs to backup every time it changes.
So you have a script monitoring for file change and making a copy.

Youre wrong, if no one else could dig those holes cheaper and the holes could not be counterfeitted and for some reason there was a demand for those holes then they would be worth a minimium of what it cost to produce.
The problem with your example is anyone can dig holes, and holes have no scarcity or demand.
People compare bitcoin with tulips in ignorance as well.    If the tulips had real scarcity and cost a fortune to produce and there was a limit on the total number of tulips the bubble probably would have never burst.
Gold will never be sold for less than what it costs to pull out of the ground.

I was not saying the price is based on cost to aquire.
I was simply saying it's a lot more than $0
Last time I read an article about the cost to produce 1 bitcoin it was over $1000.
Also, there now exists an entire economy (worth billions in IP and infrastructure) being built on top of blockchain platforms.  All of which is backed by bitcoin (in the sense that those assets are priced in bitcoin and exchanged for bitcoin, in the same way the USD maintains it's trade value by forcing foreign oil producers to exchange with USD).  Literally thousands of companies and employees and offices and equipment all to support the blockchain industry.
People like yourself also downplay the utility of the perfect speculative asset, one which cannot be counterfeited and is easy to authenticate.  There exist many entities which do nothing more than look for secure ways of trading things, doesn't matter if it's a coin or a piece of cardboard.  Bitcoin will have a market as a store of value forever in all likelihood. 
It is just incredibly naive to say that there is nothing underlying the bitcoin value.  I am not saying that these things account for all of it's current $6300 price tag...obviously it is massively traded and speculated on.  It would not surprise me or anyone else if it went to 3k next month.
I also fully expect that it does not find price equilibrium until it is in 6 digits.  Governments are starting to approve real trading funds around bitcoin and blockchain assets.  You will start seeing it added to peoples 401ks and other funds before you know it.  This is going to have a HUGE impact on the price even if it is just a small 1% of traditional funds.

Horrible example.
If your little dirt adventure resulted somwhow in you aquiring something limited and unique with actual value and your costs were based on doing it in a reasonably efficient way then yes that limited unique thing if it had a demand for it would be worth at a minimum of $2000.

People are wrong when they say it has no intrinsic value. 
Just like gold it has a cost to produce.  The miners themselves could not sell you $2 bitcoin without going bankrupt.  It costs a fortune to produce a bitcoin right now.
Stop pretending its all air, people.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:43:11
In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the theory that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor, capital, or land) and taxation.
This is something everyone knows, even common sense.  Are you kidding me?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:22:01

Its not as if backing up a tiny file is some cutting edge problem that can not easily be solved by clients.
LN scales so well in part because everyone is keeping their own personal ledger with their peers.
Its not a game breaker to have some redundancy.  It won't even really require much overhead on the hardware/software to automatically back it up everytime there is a change in channel state.  
Also afaik the channel state is not really sensitive so it wouldn't hurt to upload it to the cloud or to another device automatically.
PS: I dont want to set the stage for further hard forks.  This is the  attack vector and my biggest concern.
I'd love if it were just about impossible to ever fork.  :)

Extremely underrated comment.
I agree that lightning needs larger blocks and so does the lighting whitepaper.
In the meantime the whole "what if fees are $100" is another "what if" in a long chain of irrational bcasher arguments.  
We have already seen 2017ish mempool levels...and yet fees remained reasonable.
Segwit adoption is increasing and working.  The more ln is used the better as well.
The channel factories are another element.
I think 4mb would be painless for btc (might as well leave room for future growth) but in the meantime its not a real issue imo

And it's currently down 30%+ on FUD about chinese regulation which is completely unfounded if you do a little research.

Hi, happy 6k btw.
I think youre missing the bigger picture here.  The 100k per btc rocket doesnt happen because joe normie wants  a bitcoin.  It happens because the investment banks decide they need to be playing in it.  It happens when tje brokerages decide they need to be holding volume, real volume.  The next phase of adoption happens when we have buyers ordering a billion dollars at a time.  Thats not happened yet and when it does this thing goes off the rails. 
It happens soon.

ok for example if you wanted me to receive your transaction within the next 15 minutes how much would you expect to pay realistically?  (and even then 15 minutes is a lifetime in day to day life trying to buy something)
This is why I suggested neo gas, under a minute and no fee at all.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:13:24
You could buy it with btc, so you're only paying btc fee once rather than every transaction

With all due respect sir, you are full of misunderstanding.
It is very narrow minded to look at BTC and think "Unless this coin becomes the new dollar it will fail"
In fact, as a person who invests heavily into blockchain technologies, I don't even see bitcoin being used as a global currency for the common man in the future.  I also think it's value is going to exceed 500k per coin.
There is an entire infrastructure and economy being built around blockchain technologies. New ICOs come out and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, pay employees 6 figure salaries, build office buildings and equipment.  Bitcoin more and more is becoming the gold of the cryptoverse.  These alt-coins have value because BTC has value, if a token comes out which you can not get BTC for then it is worthless.  
Not only is it the backbone of the new blockchain industry but it is also a new digital age store of value.  For all of time the rich have looked for efficient ways of putting away their fortunes, buying paintings, gold, property, etc.  Bitcoin is a new way for future generations to hold their wealth.  Far more liquid than gold or property and just as valuable.  I could even text you my bitcoins or go buy a new computer with them no problem at all. I could even pay for a reddit gold membership using bitcoin.
Unlike tulips or other hyped assets in the past, bitcoin is incredibly scarce and CANNOT be counterfeited.  As it's adoption rises so does it's value.  It is foolish to think it isn't backed by anything, not only does it currently cost over a thousand dollar to mine a single bitcoin (so it has a price floor) but as I mentioned before it currently is the backbone of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure.
It will have it's ups and downs but don't be mistaken in thinking that it's only value is as a global currency.  It's already serving it's primary utility now and that alone can bring it to a trillion dollar valuation.

Since last night china has now halted all ICO trading, banning ICOs entirely.
Pretty much everything is taking a nose dive at the news  but neo most of all since it is the "Chinese ethereum" 
I was buying last night at $29 woke up this morning and bought more at $18. 
It could be a longer term play now until china sorts out what it wants to do.  If I understand correctly the stop is just a temporary measure while it writes new regulation.

You know lately I've been getting a boner getting free money and then putting it into bitcoin.  I signed up for several apps that give rewards for using them or for referring friends (one app in particular is making us each $5 a pop)  and today I asked my wife who is an attorney if there is any reason we can't open a million new bank accounts for the $200-500 bonuses they give. (she said no not as long as we abide by their terms)....
long story short I've made about $300 this week in referrals and other bonuses and I have about 3 banks I'm about to visit for $800 :D
It has become an addiction finding ways to get free money it felt so good the other day going to best buy and buying whatever I wanted and knowing it was all free.  I'm not poor or anything it just feels really good lol

Also neo is releasing a mobile wallet that works very simply, you can have a contact list and easily send money with aliases rather than long address codes

Bitcoin is used all the time.  There is a multi billion dollar blockchain industry that is booming right now and bitcoin is the gold that backs it.  Six figure salaries, new offices and equipment, billions of dollars worth of infrastructure is popping up to support this new industry.  Currently more than 1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin is changing hands every day.
Bitcoin isn't just some coin meant to buy your coffee anymore.  It has become more than that.  It has become the backbone of an entire new industry.  If I want to start a new blockchain technology company tomorrow and create an ERC20 token, that token only has value if people are willing to pay BTC for it.  The value of my company is based on the amount of BTC someone will trade for it, not dollars.  Sure you could use dollars to buy the BTC but when was the last time you saw an ICO which you could use fiat for?
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:11:12

@_date: 2017-10-03 17:43:07
Nope, if you say for example "have have a million dollars worth of bitcoin" you just put a million dollar bounty to the whole hacker community.
No social engineering required, not if you're a normal computer user with hundreds of apps and an open connection to the internet.  Look in to various 0days and see if you used any of those applications recently.  Then think about the fact that by the time the average Joe can look up a 0day online it's already old news.
These are usually not the kind of hacks you can install into a website to mass hack all the visitors.  You'd have to be motivated to single out a specific individual, research what is listening on his devices (the applications which connect to the intetnet).  Create a profile of his digital devices, what type, what OS...
Then if there is not already a vulnerability in one of those listening threads (and there usually are if you're a normal consumer) you can continually monitor them until there is or find some thing you run by an independent developer who has lax security and create a way in. 
Before you think this sounds like too much work there are places in this world where the entire community is competent and poor, and would work for weeks on a 1million dollar bounty if they knew it was real.  Literally revolve their life around it.

You need to stop using a custodial wallet and start ising breez wallet
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:48:47
Hey man how about actually keeping up before spreading fud?
There are now several ways to straight from fiat to lightning channel.
Also its actually EASIER for me to on board users to lightning now than BTC using non-custodial wallets like breez.technology lightning only wallet.
Two key things most dont understand:
1: its trivial to run lnd node from your phone and obfuscate the complexity like breez and a few others do.
2: if someone opens a channel with your node you dont need ANY btc.  This provides inbound liquidty and you can fund the channel any way you want.  (Submarine swaps, fiat) 
Bitcoin is leaving you behind while you moan about configuring nodes.  Stop it.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:08:01


You realize its a top 10 coin with over a billion marketcap?
Neo is far from a shit coin it is the most advanced crypto project currently available and if you look in to the consensus method if anything it's more secure than BTC, it can't be forked, and it's not proof of work.  It's also quantum proof, unlike btc.

Some people would disagree with me but I think for faster returns an altcoin like neo is a better bet.  It has potential tp be worth much more and pays dividend of 8-14% not including the coins growth.
Getting into alt coins can be risky and addicting.  Most of them will become worthless so you really need to be careful.
There are 10x gains to be made everywhere but its easy to start gambling on worthless coins.

Ok, sorry to insult you but you really are demonstrating a high level of ignorance in your response.
I mentioned the breez wallet specifically because yes it makes it VERY simple to send small amounts since it uses submarines swaps.
Step 1: install and run breez
Step 2: there is no step two you now have an oprn lightning channel with 1 million sat ($100ish) liquidity inbound.
You have a 10k sat utxo on chain that you wish you could spend? Breez uses submarine swaps so you can atomic swap btc onchain to offchain instantly just send btc to the "add funds" address and your lightning channel will be funded in 1 conf.
I want to give you 5000 sats because youre new to bitcoin and I want to show you how cool it is? Ok you download breez and i send you 5000 sats offchain and then you go play at lightningnetworkstores.com.
And its not just breez, anyone can request free inbound channels from lnbig.com up to 5 million satoshis ($500), as many as you want.  Easy to integrate with BLW ( Bitcoin Lightning Wallet ) on android.  
Don't like them either?
Ok bitrefill opens channels with you for a price and so does eclair's mobile wallet.  
ALL of these wallets are non-custodial.
Not easy enough yet?  
Let's say I'm a new user with no bitcoin or knowledge of bitcoin.  Thats ok.  Now you can use sparkswap to go straight from fiat to lightning using a trustless escrow that only unlocks once you receive your full lightning channel (like htlcs with fiat)
You can also use the new Olympus service to go from credit card/bank card to lightning as well.

I bought AMD at $4 around 2011-2012 just "knowing" it would go up.  Right after I bought it, it dropped to 2 dollars and created a huge hole in my portfolio for like 5 years...I started hating that stock.

Thing is, since it's decentralized how does it know the precise order of things? Information takes time to reach each separate ledger.  If you spend twice it's possible and likely that many nodes will get the second transaction first.  Others would get the correct one first.  Each node is a "vote".

I'm enjoying learning about this and your response is illuminating..do you mind explaining a little more for me?  
So my understanding is that you are basically creating a backlog of transactions that won't actually become official until it writes to the block chain?  I don't understand how your wallet would reflect that you have fewer coins without the main chain thinking you have fewer coins?
Also I don't understand how "if someone cheats it will just close the channel" wouldn't that just void all the payments already made on that channel? (which could be a good thing for a cheater?) 
I'm sorry if this question is really ignorant.  Just trying to learn :)

The problem with coinbase is only IF you actually have a problem.  Their support is non-existent.  I use them everyday however and they are flawless for me.  Fingers crossed I don't have an issue.  Just make sure your bank is aware of your activity and make everything go as smooth as possible.

If you have the money buy some now just in case.  I'd buy some now then again at 2400 2300 etc all the way down, but save some in case it drops to 2k.  I have spent too much on the way down and regretted it when it went to 2k and I didn't have enough extra money.  Then when it goes to 2700+ again drop some of that extra you spent on the way down just to realize a little profit and have the money so you can do it again next dip.  Keeping the majority in of course.
