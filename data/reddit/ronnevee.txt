Are you in the US? If so you would file a 1040 tax form, as well as form 8615 if you made over $2100. If you made less then that, I think you may just tag onto your parents return. Because of the Kiddie Tax Rule it's a little more complicated. Do your parents have an accountant? If not, ask for help over on r/tax for exactly how to do this.
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:43:17
Correct, if your overall gains for the year are at a negative, there are no taxes to pay.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:26:32
You can't max retirement accounts without income though? At least not tax deferred ones, as they are limited by your taxable income amount.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:27:50
No, those don't create taxable income, so you can't put money into a tax deferred account. You are taking like an IRA right?
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:25:35
Any time it's traded is also a taxable event. It does not need to be sold to fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:25:49
Just be aware of the kiddie tax, if you are a tax dependent of someone else. After about 2k in capital gains, you start to pay the 28% trust tax rate.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:45:33
Well, they aren't idiots.lol Tax law is pretty elegant and logical. You can't put mystery money into a ROTH, and b get it out tax free with gains. That would be stupid to allow. So it has to be paired with earned income.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:48:33
You don't PAY taxes on a sale that results in a loss. It's a tax event, yes, but one thar results in a tax deduction, not more taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:53:47
Do you have other income and file a tax return? Then yes. You pay taxes on that 100.00.
There are a lot of nuances, like you may fall into the 0% capital gains tax rate if it's long term gains.
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:15:39
And dependant status as well. Don't forget the kiddie tax. Also impacts EIC, and effectively can radically increase someone's taxes by more then they evensde if they are eligible for EIC.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:37:56
Then you have a tax filing requirement at 2100, and will have to figure the kiddie tax.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:51:39
Yes, in the US, inheriting something is the much preferred tax treatment, as you get the stepped up basis at time of death.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:27:32
Capital gains are part of your income, yes. So assuming these are all long term gains, you'd have 38k at the 0 bracket, 400k at the 15% bracket, and the rest at 20%.
This only applies if you are independent for tax purposes though. If not, the kiddie tax kicks in at around 2000.00.
@_date: 2019-07-29 13:27:32
That is why you are required to make estimated tax payments through the year, so you arevr caught up in this. You need to safely set aside you tax liability as you realize profits. Not leave it all invested.
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:31:41
You are only taxed on the gains above your initial investment amount though. So it's not double tax.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:24:55
Your bracket starts at about 2k a year, if you are a dependent of another tax payer, as is very likely your situation.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:27:29
In so much as it won't show a loss, yes. It won't show a gain though. Just saying "oh, I lost it" is not going to cut it.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:48:27
You don't PAY taxes on a sale that results in a loss. It's a tax event, yes, but one thar results in a tax deduction, not more taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:46:59
Yes, you are taxed on gains if the gifted crypto is worth more when you sell it, then when your dad bought it.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:32:53
IRA accounts can only be funded if you have earned income. Or if your spouse does.
You mean... Like buy crypto and sell crypto?lol Why would you not report your crypto income then try to generate other income?
Anyway, let's get to the basics here. You have to have earned income. Not capital gains to contribute to a tax advantaged retirement account. So even crypto income won't work, unless you mine. 
You have tax free income space, why not claim your crypto gains using that space? Is it that you want no record of it attached to you?
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:41:55
Well, I don't know how they have you in a tight squeeze. You aren't paying taxes on the income, why do you care if you put it in a tax deferred account or not? Just open a regular investment account, without the restrictions of a tax deferred retirement plan. Right? Am I missing something here? Why do you care if it goes in an IRA?
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:06:18
You don't report a purchase on its own, you report sales and trades, and the purchase price when you do that, establishes your basis. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:46:26
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:23:36
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:12:25
0, 15, or 25 percent on long term gains, depending on your total income for the year
28% if you are a tax dependent, and have over 2k of gains.
Your regular tax rate on short term gains.
So it really depends on your total income situation.
@_date: 2019-08-23 22:12:39
No, they just taxes once on each dollar earned.
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:22:59
It's like being taxed on your income. Investing that income, and paying taxes on the interest. Same thing.
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:31:08
Yes, you owe taxes on the current value of the Bitcoin minus 600.00.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:03:04
Yes, you will pay long term capital gains on the increase in value since you bought.
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:51:11
It's handled the same exact way. If you work for 10 hours, and are given 2 goats, you report the value of those goats as earned income (not capital gains) at that time. Being paid in items is still a taxable earned income event. 
Then if you sell those goats for twice that in 6 months, you pay taxes on that gain in value. Now, since they are goats you had to take care of them, so that's earned income as well. If we did the same story problem with gold coins, the earning would be taxed as earned income at the date of earning them, and the increase in value would be capital gains when you sell. Exactly like crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:43:27
Yes, correct. You claim income and pay taxes when you earn it, and pay capital gains on any increase before you sell.
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:55:33
Same as gold, or barter work for a painting, or goats for a cow. It's not treated like fiat. It's treated like trading tangible items.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:51:54
Any trade is a tax event. So if you have trades you have a reporting requirement.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:42:57
No, trades are a taxable event.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:07:07
He will just report it on his regular tax return at the end of the year. Filling out the proper forms and calculating what is owed. He can use a program like Freetaxusa.com.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:40:10
That doesn't legally avoid taxes. It's just a less likely way to be caught. It means having to file a fraudulent tax return.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:46:59
In the US:
Gifts do not reset basis. Only inheritance resets basis.
With a gift, you get the gifters basis.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:45:15
Right. You can lie on your tax return. If you are willing to do that you can avoid taxes in lots of ways. It doesn't get you off the hook if audited though.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:40:41
Any exchange of one thing of value for another thing if value, yes.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:57:13
That was the point. That comparing federal tax fraud to going over the speed limit was not an equitable comparison.
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:46:05
Yes, that's taxable trading. You probably need to file a tax return to show your loss or gains, or else you'll get a tax bill for way more then is correct. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:40:33
No. The final 1040 is out. Released. This question is not on it. See for yourself. As in your cropped picture, it was under the social security line. Now it is not. It was removed before finalizing the draft.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:54:38
You only attach the schedule 1 if you have other income. So if you don't have other income of any sort, you are not attaching that schedule. You don't attach the schedule 1 just to check yes or no to that question.
But people with other income, even if no crypto gains, will have to answer that question.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:30:00
Do you commit murder?
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:48:16
But you are saying they are asking everyone that. Not everyone fills out the schedule 1. Only some people do, that have investment income.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:36:49
That was a proposed draft. Like I said, it's not on the final 1040 released.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:28:41
Yes, that's exactly how it works.
It is actually better to realize gains in years you have lower income, then to cash it all out at once. So a good read strategy is to realize just enough gains to fill up your lowest tax bracket each year, as you can expect income to go up in future years.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:02:38
This question is not on the final 1040 design.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:16:01
Yes, by not selling it while alive. When he dies, the basis resets, and the inheriter never has to pay on those gains during the original buyers lifetime.
@_date: 2019-12-15 11:25:09
Yes, you will pay taxes on the profits, even if you buy Bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2019-04-20 00:40:02
Yes it is. That is how stepped up basis of capital gains work. Look it up.
* though only up to 11 million total estate
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:29:04
It doesn't have any preferential treatment, no. It is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 03:09:39
It would be completely exploited otherwise. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:28:16
Assuming the US. When you buy the home you realize any gains the coin made since you bought it. You then pay taxes on the gains. The basis of the house is what you paid for it. The fact that it's coin and a house makes no difference. It works just like if you traded Bitcoin for Litecoin. It realizes your gains for tax purposes.
