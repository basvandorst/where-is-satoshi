Actually looking for law enforcement and lawyer feedback, I could google it but I want a more legit answer.

I work in and film porn, it is not that simple at all and doing that would put you in more trouble than just prostitution as you would not be verifying the age to legal requirements and keeping records for the required time.
Edit: Once you film it for money, it is very regulated and if you got caught and used that excuse you would be found guilty on so much other shit it would probably be in your best interest to just say it was a prostitute. IANAL so I said probably.

So to give jewelry for sex is prostitution too because that happens EVERY DAY.

Also all employment paper work has to be completed and filed according to county law and you have to disclose this for tax purposes now and they have to claim it as well. Also, did you check and make sure it is legal in your county to do, did you meet all STD testing requirements, also remember you have to keep this information stored for 7 years... It's more complicated than just throw up a camera and sign a few things or people would be doing that.
But you could go through all the hoops and make porn if you wanted to and it is legal where you are.

Yeah, like I said, you can go through all the hoops and film porn but it is illegal is most the US as porn is technically prostitution. Only a few hand full of places have fought to have it classified as free speech so it is probably illegal where you are EVEN if you call it porn.

Totally agree.

So a sugar daddy arrangement is fine so long as sex is not guaranteed? Or would that be illegal too for other reasons?
Edit: That was a brain fart, you don't have to answer that but thanks again.

Oh well, I doubt many of her clients have bitcoin anyway so it doesn't really matter, but I was curious. YAY for laws to protect us from ourself while in the privacy of our own bedrooms!!!

Got ya, so it is more the requirement of sex in trade for ANYTHING. Makes sense, thanks.

I am talking about if cops walk in and catch you, and you use your excuse of "it's a porn". You would be required to have their information and verified it to be correct... I am sure you can then just say "well then I will get her ID and verify it"... but there are still more rules and laws and yes eventually you could just make porn but it is more complicated than just get their ID. Some states do not allow it at ALL even if it is legit porn. Here in FL, Miami-Dade county is a little more lax than other places, but porn may not be legal to film where you are.

It really looks like their ONLY defense would be a mistrial on how they discovered his server - which got left untouched in the trial (and I do not think would have been enough anyway). I think Ross lied to his lawyer and his lawyer thought "I can get this innocent guy off easy" until Dratel finds out Ross did actually start the site and realizes "We're fucked" because he had nothing planned and was mislead to start with. Then came the diary and it was as good as done. If it is true Dratel learned on the first day Ross did actually start the site then Ross screwed himself.

All too crazy! So when do we start the Maryland case??? That's the one I have been interested in from the beginning. Will it get the attention this one did?
