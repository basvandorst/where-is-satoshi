no problem :) what was your guess ?
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:43:04
LEVEL 2 UP 0.1 BTC award to the solver !
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:46:27
hmm that is weird, send me your BTC adress and i will do it manually while i try to solve the problem
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:30:11
hey, good thinking, i will provide that soon :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:44:03
hey thank you :)! the site is fresh (uploaded it today) will add a clock and a Score board as soon as my friend can help :)
thank you for passing this along! 
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:37:44
you're doing great! have you done these kinds of things before ?
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:58:03
Thanks for playing :)! new Ciphers will be up in some days ! will let everyone give a crack at it first
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:21:21
ooh, you got 200 Satoshis because you were the second one to solve it :/
your adress won't show up cuz you haven't received any BTC from faucetB0x before, as soon as those satoshis arrives you'r adress will be registered and you can track your future funds.
faucetbox is a bit slow on sending out bitcoins.

you've got PM, you're close ;)
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:12:01
hey ! i will fix that so its more clear that the answers have been used up :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:16:06
Fixed :)
@_date: 2015-01-23 07:02:56
don't forget you only have 15 lives and 4 days left to solve it, i might add more time / lives tho !
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:24:44
thanks :D
i'm sorry but i can't tell you what you're suppose to get as an answer :/
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:50:54
Hey! i figured out the problem. its faucet box. they do not send out bitcoins until you've reached certain Level of Satoshis on a single adress. which is 1300. but i will send you anyway, and in the future incase the  prize to 1300 Satoshis
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:15:40
hey sorry, it was a misstake, i Copy-pasted an old text i had.
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:41:31

@_date: 2015-01-25 21:30:43

@_date: 2015-01-25 23:44:49

@_date: 2015-01-23 07:24:14

@_date: 2015-01-24 11:50:29

i will try to add a ''Score board'' so people can type in a Name + password if they wanna be on the score board :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:39:52
