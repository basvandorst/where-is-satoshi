You can't mine bitcoin anymore with a normal PC. What you can do or is mine other coins or sell hashing power and get paid in bitcoin. I did the lather. 
But I shut down my minerpc (gtx1080l some months ago selling hashing power. It's not profitable anymore. 
At the peak I got something like 5 euro in BTC per day. Now it's 0.5 Euro in BTC. ... (Without subtracting electricity costs!!)
I kept track of our meter during and after mining and really saw a drop. My electricity bill is now 1/3 of what it was with my PC running constantly. And that's only with one PC and one GPU! I gasped when I saw that. 
I'm glad I had the last few months of somewhat profitable mining, but it's dead now. 
Difficulty is too high and electricity is too expensive. 
To give you an idea: The electricity used for our house in total was 150-180 euro per month, Now without the PC running all day and night it's around 30.. 
So profit? Nope!
Now imagine your parents when that electricity bill comes and you have to explain yourself. 
So: don't do it.

Oh thanks! Seems to be perfect :)

I should've bought some more yesterday... Woulda shoulda coulda...
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:10:44
It probably is to get filthy *filthy* rich like those early adopters who could buy at insanely low prices or still mine with a normal PC...
Oh well. I hopped on board on 5 january trying to cost average. Will hodl.

Buy your Bitcoin where you want but do send them to your OWN wallet as soon as you get them!
For all we know Coinbase goes bust and you're left with nothing.
I use Coinbase too to buy them, but I have my own wallet where I hodl them.

I read somewhere it was a bit unsafe because then, if they check the addresses balance and it has a large amount on it, it's a more desirable target to attack.
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:00:51
You could try Nicehash, no? Earns BTC by using your hashing power for other alts.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:33:19
I'm a Coinbase user but have transferred my BTC to my own  wallet immediately after buying them. 
Just use CB to buy. 
Could be cheaper elsewhere but I like the ease of use.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:46:24
I'd say: Keep on hodling, even if it drops. Who knows what the future holds...

... that was exactly my plan too: buying a Focus RS... But got greedy and waited too long. ��

What's the use of 1.2 million if you don't buy anything with it? ;) 
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:16:04
Stop talking about it. Show 'em your Lambo when it's on TV again.
@_date: 2019-02-26 08:50:28
What a shitshow. I'm glad I'm not in the US. 
Damn.

Belgium. 
Here there are taxes on cryptogezind too, but most fall in the category of not having to report it. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:19:02
I know, but if Steam sees an increase of using Bitcoin, maybe that will change. Not using it because of this would be a bit of a chicken and egg story. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:52:00
Sadly NewEgg doesn't operate in Belgium, and I can't seem to find a shop that does accept Bitcoin and operates here. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:13:42
It's the same price. 
But if you've gotten BTC at €950 and now it's €1100, then you've got more € to spend as BTC, simply said.
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:46:36
Belgium too:)

By multiple address you mean the new addresses MyCelium creates when clicking the receive bitcoin address?
So it's better to get 1 address and use that one after buying coins on an exchange instead of using the address MyCelium gives you?
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:27:08
No, it could drop to zero. You still have your BTC, but if you want € for it, you're out of luck there...
If nobody wants BTC, and I try to sell, I wouldn't get €. 
If everybody wants BTC and there is only so much BTC left, the highest bidder gets the BTC.
But when BTC would drop, I would buy more. 
I consider BTC buys as "money gone". Only when I would sell or buy stuff with BTC, that BTC has the value it has.
If someone would be willing to sell me a million dollar house for 1BTC, and I sell that house for 1 million dollar, that 1 BTC would have been worth 1 million dollar.
The BTC price is dependant on what people want to give and want for it, not programmed.

Alzheimer van.
Or a blow to the head...
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:44:33
What? No. He's stating a good point here. If transferring money costs you that much, it's easier not to deal with it at all.
So if I understand this correctly, having 1 BTC after buying a small amount each time (let's say $25 each month, so DCA'ing), if you want to spend everything at once, you'll spend WAY more on fees than somebody who's able to buy 1 BTC in one go? Do I understand this correctly? Is that really how it works?
That still means "rich people" get a discount while "poor people" pay way more? What the fuck is that about?
Please tell me that's not the case?

Mycelium Gear?
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:53:12
I wanted the game and wanted to try Bitcoin to pay for it. I probably paid more in Euros with fees, but as my hodlings are worth more today than what I paid for them it's not so bad. If we want Bitcoin to succeed, we need to use/spend it instead of trading it.
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:17:25
Not using it at all isn't helping too either, right?
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:03:47
Damn. I'd probably lose my mind and turn actually criminal... :s
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:34:10
Yeah, that's the reason I ask. Because I don't know if my BTC will be safe after the split.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:38:44
I would wait it out. If you don't sell, you've lost nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:56:19
That's true, but if you spend money you can't miss, you're doing it wrong anyway.
I consider the Euros I've put in Bitcoin more or less "gone". 
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:45:28
With bigger blocks you need faster internet and computers too. Not everyone has access to the internet speeds and computer capacities needed to handle the bigger blocks. And to keep it decentralized you need to keep it accessible. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:33:12
I  have the same question...
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:29:55
What seems to be the problem?
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:23:05
Would I have sex with a hot lady? Yes.
Would I have sex with family? No
See the difference? These are jokes. 
What do you mean by "if you're currently on the internet"? The time? Ever heard of different timezones?
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:28:55
Whahaha. Come on.
These are really only some stupid jokes. If that offends anyone, jeeezes... 
That PC shizzle is sooooo tiring. You can't tell any joke or pun or some SJW is there to crash the party. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:39:15
Because it's always the same. Make a joke about any minority or anything and there's the PC brigade telling you how foul you are for even thinking about it. 
The jokes weren't offensive. If you think that's offensive just try this: 
Laughed my ass off.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:22:52
I didn't find anything too.
It's just silly jokery. Nothing more.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:31:55
Whaha. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:41:11
So Mycelium users can use their 12 word seed to import their wallets on both chains in other apps, right?
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:43:25
Maybe he wants to initiate a dump so he can buy some cheap coins?;)
