As most ALT-Coins are traded back into ETH/BTC/LTC, these few coins are amongst the safest Crypto Currency holdings. You want to convert you ALT-Coins back into Fiat? The road starts with one of these 3. 
The original poster neglects to mention this.
Especially BTC/ETH, they are the Key in the KeyPair relationship with all other Crytpo Currencies.

Valid points. 100% Agree. Lightning Labs software has been in testing for about 1 year, its almost Production ready. In a few months, the tide will change drastically.

If it gets listed on the NASDAQ, it could go over $1Million/Coin. As of right now, BitCoin is the only Coin that will be listed on the NASDAQ.

Yah, its real. Thankfully they just passed Tax Reform, so the rate of taxation went down a bit.
One particular party in general loves increasing Capital Gains taxes... sad.

Satoshi isn't a him... but a collective. If you really want to send coins to nowhere, send them to me instead.... Thanks.

It's basic investment advice, but it neglects to mention a few key facts, so its not that brilliant. He left out some very key details, such as the reason for BTC's valuation and why anyone shouldn't be that 'skittish' yet -
My previous post on the matter:
"As most ALT-Coins are traded back into ETH/BTC/LTC, these few coins are amongst the safest Crypto Currency holdings. You want to convert you ALT-Coins back into Fiat? The road starts with one of these 3.

As others have predicted, BTC will grow past the $100,000 per coin range, I suspect this will become reality for various reasons, but mainly because there is A LOT of new money coming into the market. As the rise of the ALT-Coins continues, so will the price in BTC under the current KeyPair relationship and Fiat conversion for profit taking. 
All of these factors Cement BTC/ETH's role as the KingPins of all KeyPairs, they are the Master Currencies. This will continue to be the case until the exchanges allow other Crypto's to be traded into Fiat, etc... 
Since the exchanges themselves have massive interests in BTC, LTC and ETH, don't expect this to change anytime soon.
Yes, they will have there ups and downs, but expect the upward trend as money continues to poor into the market.

I don't even own any BTC at the moment...  But I'm rooting for you guys... HODL until Lightning Network!

You are correct and your point is well made. I spoke in error.
On the other hand, here is one link to BitCoin on the NASDAQ, via Grayscale.

Uphold must have a really crappy UI that doesn't even check against account type and the amount entered into a textbox. Seriously, no validation against a value entered? C'mon. That is awful programming. Everyone should stay away from Uphold.

Oleg, you need to sue Uphold to initiate the recovery procedure. Get a lawyer and try to contact them. Reach them at their physical address in Charleston, South Carolina. Do not hesitate...

You just said everyone's best advice.
While you are waiting, some interesting reads: 
Comical perspective with serious sarcasm: 
Please note: Bitcoin has repeated this Boom/Bust cycle repeatedly over the last 5 years.*
* If another currency becomes a major KeyPair, it will disrupt the current dynamic, this hasn't happened yet.

You must be an angry B2X Hodler.

You are missing the point... The News Quartz has reported on is inaccurate!
