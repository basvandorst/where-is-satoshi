Are you feeling ok @_date: 2018-01-10 17:38:26
Yup, he's a fish.

You are most likely right in not having it in US dollars, but they will have it in assets, like BTC.

That moment you know for sure that BTC will hit $20k-$25k by January and want to take out a loan from a shark.

Well said will.

Yeah you're talking nothing but trash. luno.com doesn't support BCH and Bitcoin.com website sells BTC not BCH. Filth comes in all shapes and sizes.

segwit isn't being used on gdax yet. segwit helps to speed up the network and keep fees low, but only if everyone uses it. it does this by reducing transaction sizes and allows for more transactions in a block.
that's the theory of it. but practically, it's pretty much impossible to expect everyone, including big players, to optionally adopt it, unless the community does some serious boycotting.

your salty reply isn't going to make your BTC transaction faster or cheaper either.

That moment you realize all forks of BTC are actually used to artificially pump BTC. It's the flow of free money.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:23:19
Let us not forget, there are some 'big' players out there who still have 1000's of BTC who are getting free money from these numerous forks. Do you think they're not going to take that free money and reinvest it into BTC or anywhere else? :) Think of the pineapplefund, how much BTC he held at the time of the forks, and has free money from Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Super Bitcoin ...etc.

advertising his conviction for reselling firecrackers on eBay in 2002 isn't going to make BTC faster and cheaper than BCH.

I personally believe BTC has gotten so big that reaching a consensus from developers/miners who have different opinions will be next to impossible unless BTC is at a tipping point, maybe only then will everyone agree on an on-chain solution. I worry that the developers have an on-chain solution but are afraid to implement it as it will come at the expense of the miners, whom hold the power to determine the type of fork. I hope that someday there will be an on-chain solution, but I don't think we will see one without serious price-effecting drama.

It's gone, prepare for a bullrun.

You should be able to put FIAT into Coinbase, and then transfer the FIAT to GDAX (which is owned by the same people as Coinbase), and  buy BTC through that, without any fees. I'm not sure if this works for the UK too. There's a youtube video with instructions on this.

You should sell enough of it to buy a house and enough to allow you to change your lifestyles so you're not living paycheck to paycheck. Don't be stingy when investing in your marriage and family. A mortgage will only bring in a lot of stress that could destroy your marriage. If you're really concerned, then don't tell her about all of it ... too much money can change people and she may disagree with your plans of what you intend on doing with the BTC, especially if you intend on keeping BTC but then it turns to shit (the "I told you so" and "you should've" will haunt you forever).
