Futures.. this is what happens when you get the banks involved.. they will try to take it down AND make money off of it.. can anyone check the ledger to see if it pinpoints certain accounts?

Sorry Im pretty illiterate when it comes to investments / retirement information.  Does this mean that we would have to take all of the money out with fees, taxes, etc and then only be able to invest whatever is leftover?

It's that magical time of year

Maybe if it hits 50k she'll show you how kids are made. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:05:22
Any recommendations?

The other question is who faps to the bitcoin price after their dump. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:55:20
Where r you getting your info? A sudden selloff of $1B bitcoin would drop the price significantly... just because the market cap is several billion doesn't mean someone selling an actual billion relative to the market wouldn't drop it hard.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:47:09
yeah we are not in dire straights.. we both have retirements with our current companies.. was just trying to think of another way to invest this money if possible.  Thanks for the info.

Is there a way to tell on mobile or the app if it's not the website it appears to be?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:49:12
so basically ~45% penalty / taxes or 72% through GBTC?
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:32:03
100,000 =/= close to a billion.. research how large the difference between those two numbers is.. 100,000$ was only 5 BTC at one point. A selloff of 10,000 bitcoins dropped the price several thousand dollars ( mtgox selloff) .. also yeah maybe a billion back and forth over a days period, but not all at once.

Where you can watch/ see these walls?

The account opened in 2011 and had multiple transactions from a wallet called "mtgoxandothers".. could be an old silk road or black market wallet / karpeles personal wallet.. it is very intriguing.. that's a crapload of bitcoin

BCH did spike like 15% over last two days 
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:33:48
More like SODLBTC when it was around $15k.. gotta take some profit.

Why do people buy in just to sell a week later or as soon as they realize it can go down as fast as it can go up? It's an "investment".. the same people "burst the bubble".. bought high, price dropped, sell low, complain about scam, start kickstarter, price rises, complain, buy high again, cycle.

What is this? it seems to contradict most of the other responses.

USD and in France.. so maybe not an applicable law there? Or outside of USA?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:10:21
Umm.. Bitcoin is the largest standard for almost all coins.. so if it drops in price then all of the others automatically follow suit (drop in USD but not necessarily in satoshis.)

Is the NSA paper more of a proposal for a debit card style system? The end specifically points to take away anonymity in cash puechases/ money laundering and be able to track / trace where peoples money is and goes where bitcoin is the opposite.

Based on those monitors.. looks like hes already downsizing.. maybe they were a black Friday special 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:12:24
Will people sell Bitcoin as it drops and buy alts or will alts drop drastically in satoshis and people try to frantically buy bitcoin at a lower price?!
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:03:02

@_date: 2018-12-11 02:05:44
You think that means it was started by the CIA as a way to track everyone's money since the ledger is public?!
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:22:15
Anymore info on this or rabbit holes I can follow?
