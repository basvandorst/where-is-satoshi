bitcoin has been gaining on the usd for years.  You were sold a lie that bitcoin is meant to be highly transactional by Roger Ver.  It's not.  It's a gold.  It's valuable. You are delusional, look at the charts, they are reality.

@_date: 2016-08-02 21:31:39
It's a myth that Roger Ver and Gavin/Hearn started.  The price is falling because big-blockers don't understand how bitcoin works so they are wrecking it.  We just have to teach them about computer science and economics!

We are in his classroom, and the paradigm of school has changed.  It's just weird because i can't explain it to my friends and family.  They think I'm doing nothing.

He's talked about this a little I think in his orign's of money, but furthermore he says he has more than one more essay in mind in this line/direction and so he probably will go into it!
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:54:19
Yup nice thoughts thx.  But its not a correction, Satoshi didn't, in that quote, talking about what happens next, once bitcoin is bootstrapped ;)  What will happen in regard to the existing system?  He doesn't go into it.  But they both know.  They both have a vision in this regard...but they won't say.  :)

@_date: 2016-04-23 08:08:03
Yes we would stop.  We would think, and discuss, "what is ideal money" and "how can it be brought about".   It is complex.  But I don't need to show this.  I have very good sources to back up the fact that scaling bitcoin create Ideal Money will do the exact opposite.  Bitcoin needs to be as stable as possible, not malleable.
You see, trust, in this context, is what is needed.  People need to know that it will not change 10 15 30 50 or 100 years from now.  
The problem is, the individual, even the collective of today, thinks irrationally about money.
@_date: 2016-04-24 17:40:43
This is all perfectly correct and perfectly balanced with the understanding that the division between individuals is false.  That we are creating a wholisitic perspective, and so for this there cannot be said to be a division between the wise and the ignorant. 
In other words are all in it together, or as strong as the weakest link.

I don't have any fear.  The blocksize is stuck at 1mb, and soon you won't be able to buy coffee with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:55:20
How could you get to the conclusion here that the argument of when to increase a limit on blocks, which includes the time period of "never at all", leads to "good or "bad" being pointless.  Full blocks are good, and a significant increase in the "hard limit" is pointless and futile.  Once you get past that rationalization you are left with no argument, and no arguers that are arguing or in conflict about the block size.  
Simply put, new-comers to bitcoin are debating the block size and the wise knowledgeable players have already realized there can never be a significant change.
Bitcoin is not a coffee money and  will never be.

@_date: 2016-04-23 03:11:23
You cannot scale the blocksize in such a way that it becomes ideal money.  That's Keyneisan thinking and its wrong.  The nature of money is such that it doesn't work that way.  This is what they don't understand.

Because you are marked as an aficionado. We live in a real world.  With real problems.  The levation of Ideal Money will effect these circumstances.  Why do you ignore this subject?  Why are you marked as someone that understands the future of money and the implications of bitcoin when you completely ignore 20 years of lectures on the subject?
I'd like to understand this from each of you.  How is it you cannot see Debating to reach consensus is counterproductive and irrational?
@_date: 2016-04-16 15:40:26
I think thats not such a comparable example.  Those bitcoins exist and their uncertainty in regard to satoshi moving them is factored into the markets to some extent.  
Nonetheless, we can agree, simply by saying bitcoin is a huge improvement. Yes, thx!
(it also suggests bitcoin could be more secure in this sense if satoshi become transparent.  I suppose there are still gox coins)
@_date: 2016-04-16 02:30:33
It is assumption to suggest that not raising the blocksize is a hindrance in any significant fashion.  It is in regard to only one usecase: a coffee money.
Nobody needs to show a compelling reason to keep the limit small, people need to show proof that a large increase is secure, and the unfortunate part for such people is that it is not possible.  
Bitcoin is what it is, we will never get consensus for unnecessary experimentation for the want of optimization.

Can you tell me what Samson's sentiments mean here?  Does he support 2mb or more?  What does he mean here?
@_date: 2016-04-23 16:54:50
Yes it is tough to find players that will humor the "other" side.  Quite easy to find those that simply want to scale at all costs.  
There tends to be mass hysteria in regard to what seems like the simple easy way to make millions (of dollars?) from bitcoin and increase adoption to the money-scale to infinity!
But the nature of money does not work like this.  Like you allude to in regard to the evolution of security through conflict, money too takes this long winding road.  
It must pass the test of all opposing sides and perspective, muslim, christian etc, western world, euro, asia etc.  It must serve nations and their governments yet also people and their daily lives. 
It cannot be "constructed" to do this you see.  A lot of people believe Satoshi both intended for him and us to construct it further, and they also think he failed and let us down in this sense...
What is more likely is that there is only a certain amount of construction needed. Only a certain amount is useful.  To plan bitcoin beyond this is to over-plan.  And over-planning is the folly of central banking....
So these players and their ideas for scaling bitcoin to serve CERTAIN purposes, are really not understanding exactly what we are trying to get away from.
It's a very strange thing to contemplate for those unaware of this point I make, but I suspect the rationale holds.
@_date: 2016-04-23 06:41:27
Who will listen to reason?
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:38:38
No its not him.  I presented it like that, because I learned what I know in an flash, and it was the quickest way to get it out there.  I can't describe it in a paragraph.  Imagine he knew bitcoin was coming, he did all the philosophical implication.  But what is important is Ideal Money is from the 50's-60's when he fled american saying he was going to save the people from the colluding governments.
If we read Szabo's works, we KNOW he must be a main player.  Sometimes I suspect the proposal is old, and floated around the nsa/rand, and then evolution came out and finally someone smart got a hold of the previous design.  
Perhaps Finney and Szabo consulted Nash.  Thats the best fit I have with the info I know.  If you were Nash though, you wouldn't do the code yourself.

A flat bitcoin price is a great thing.  But the "observable reality" is bitcoin crushed the usd last year which is amazing.  There is not problem, but people that know very little about bitcoin always think there is a "problem". As they read and learn this ignorance goes away.
@_date: 2016-04-23 20:41:11
If my answer is there is evolution over time we might understand there is nothing left to be done.  Of course there are things to do, and they are being done.  But I think that scaling block-size for Ideality is actually counter-productive to that goal.  
So I think we will learn the truth of this soon enough, and then the want to scale bitcoin in this fashion will wane.  And as this happens bitcoin will be more ideal as a result.
I don't think I propose any more of a solution, than to stop going the direction we are trying to go.
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:54:52
Yes that is all helpful.  There IS the premise, but it's not a commitment on the road map it seems.  I mean I am asking if there is a date and an agreed cap, I think rather you are suggesting it is stated as inevitable which does not address my reasons for asking.
You are an advocate of a decrease then you suggest.  I would like to understand why, and I will read but my technical understanding only goes so far.
Myself I am mostly against "scale at all costs", and mostly for listening to authority figures (where authority refers to the knowledgeable rather than those in charge)...
But I feel that we have ignored the obvious argument John Nash made, that is very relevant to the discussion.  The basic thesis is that you cannot scale bitcoin to make it Ideal, or more importantly that trying to do so degrades the quality of bitcoin in the Gresham sense.
As I understand this argument he makes has never been entertained, and the more I speak with players the more I realize (and am astounded by) the fact that seemingly nearly no one STILL has bothered to read his works.
There is also another very relevant works by David Bohm who was a brilliant man who was discredited by the very works I wish to levate: 
Bohm explains a mechanism for consensus that is technologically available. Again it seems the community is too busy fighting to even take a gander at the validity and relevance of the works.
I know both these works very well, and I have not been countered by anyone that is familiar with them.  So I think we have not had an open and honest debate, I think we haven't considered all sides, and I think this might likely be where the hang up and disconnect lies.

@_date: 2016-04-15 16:24:44
Yes let it be, however, as it stands, 1mb, bitcoin will become not a coffee money, not the p2p cash you imply it should become.  Satoshi was faced with the decision of how to best implement an idea and get enough people to accept it for it to be a worldwide phenomenon.  Now that it is bootstrapped there is a higher level game at play.  And there is nothing to be done for this game to grow to full fruition.  It has what it needs, it cannot be changed and there it is...

These players want to affect our world money systems, why do they not consult Dr. Nash.  Why do you espouse views on money that go against someone that knows better than you all combined.  Why do you try to lead the community to agreement through disagreement?
You are all irrational players.  Somebody please tell me why 20 years of lecture and works and 60 years of meditation on the subject is irrelevant.   Won't someone at least tell me I am wrong, and especially why I am wrong.

 I think we can extend the thought and see that it makes bitcoin not stable until it happens.  But this also means that those that are behind the opaqueness know this and so they must have a reason or a timeline behind not revealing.  Or it could be that it is never revealed and the correlation will fade over time.

And so you are charged with ignoring the only consensus mechanism at our disposal:

This is where a sincere person stars to see the validity in the other side of the argument.  Where as those that are insincere believe they are siding vs morons and babies, you might now find, if you haven't before that the view that is contrary to yours has great substance.
Let's take my suggestion as an assumption, as the truth, that bitcoin is for nations and not people...let's see what that implies, together...
This suggests a problem.  Because you spell out the exact damaging viewpoint the citizens of this world might take, "I want bitcoin to be MY money.  I don't care about "nations"."  Now if we are still playing the game using my assumption and our imagination, then we see Satoshi had a problem on his hands.  Ignorant people, greedy people, the nature of being a citizen of the world, is going to be the downfall of bitcoin and the technology that can bring world cohesion among nations.
You can't convince this mass, if you think you can convince a mass of ignorance that reason lies in the opposite of their opinion, you are mistaken. It cannot be done with reason and writing alone.
Ever wonder why "Satoshi" doesn't care to comment on this debate?
MONEY in fact is this special technology that arises to align our beliefs with the reason that is needed to make complex social advances.
So following the imagination here, we see Satoshi had a solution that needed to full fill two points.  1) The people needed to want to adopt bitcoin to a certain point that it could be relevant in all major countries and exchanged for all major currencies. 2) bitcoin needed to be relevant as an inflation hedge.
You feel deceived, but you did not read enough of the supporting literature.  What Satoshi said is that you can have YOUR money, but you and everyone else on this planet must agree to this change.  He gave you this gift, but its truly only a pacifier! Its a finger trap; A puzzle.  It's a concensus mechanism for a concensus that cannot be reached but by a higher level civilization which we are not.
You and others want to say we have all already agreed to make the block size bigger, with the implication it will be scaled to be YOUR money.  But I have been pointing out all along, there is no concensus for such change, and that possibility is diminishing over time, as people like you realize the significance of a settlement layer for the big players in the world.
**The problem in this world is that everyone wants money to serve themselves.  This creates an inability for a stable superior quality of money to arise, because competition is constantly crushing fundamentals.  Satoshi didn't not create stable usable money.  Satoshi put us on the path to money of a superior quality, but this is an INTERNATIONAL phenomenon that must arise over time, it is not bitcoin per se.**
You should not want to wreck this path, and Satoshi didn't give you any realistic way to do so anyways.

I see myself as more intelligent for noting that you seemed to disagree with me on something I know I am correct about, but yet still spotting talent ur through 140 chars.
Your sentiments or view is significant and relevant here, but not so much the content you see, rather the questions and inquisitive nature.  You highlight your view, but you also highlight what you don't understand about the differing view, or how other's resolve their own viewpoint (this is honesty and sincerity from u and it IS helpful).
I mean to say you may have gotten further with others presenting your inquiry, rather than the conclusion and your content.
I myself cannot understand what we mean by libertarian, for many reasons I am not capable of understanding general sentiments, or definitions, or propriety, naturally.
I am not so dualistic by nature (this is MY talent) so it is often hard for me to understand what others see as standard or generally accepted.
Your point of wiki is of course perfectly relevant.  Not because they went through the debate, instead because we are trying to use definitions from these websites that have the inherent issue we wish to discussion and differentiate.
This is a problem with language as well, that as we inquire into it, we forget that the tools we use to do so involve language and/or the inherent weakness's we wish to explore.  Bohm writes of this in his works, and so he creates a new mode (such as verb noun pronoun etc.) called rheomode.  I use them and I don't tell people generally.
Much of the rest you explain is related to perspective, or what we might call perspective, and  has to do with time. You see we don't follow this in order to find out who is correct, we follow it to realize the relationship between the views so that we can understand the source of conflict.
This is the difference between dialogue and debate.
We cannot do this in debate, because we bring in the same inherent weakness that we are trying to uncover!


This is the clue I think, this is where me and you have a chance to bring great meaning to this dialogue.  Do you think Satoshi didn't see this?  He's not so stupid and you are not so stupid to believe him to be.  You are simply knowledgeable enough on consensus to see and admit what others cannot.
For this I think that it can be said we BOTH understand consensus well, and in a way that others cannot or do not. Satoshi said “Go ahead and change the block size” he even gave the algorithm for it. Then people begged he not leave us with the debate...but he disappeared....
His sentiments were, “y'all just have to agree”.  Me and you know that its not possible.  Not with this technology, not with this kind of society, not without higher order.  Isn't this clear?


Yes you understand these things well, but there are things we should want to change and things we should not want to.  The intelligent men in this world setup our legal (constitution) and financial infrastructure (bitcoin) in such a way there is the illusion we can change it, or that theoretically we can (ie you are free to change it), but there should be no worry that the peoples will collectively “vote” to destroy these infrastructures, because an ignorant nation full of conflict cannot reach high enough consensus for such change.
Thank you sincerely for your time, your responses whether in the past or going forward.

I do it too, and I only wholeheartedly appreciate your sincerity!  I like bitcoin, I think its going to do amazing things for us.  Money has a history of insecurity, we find a good form, but the pressures our global civilization puts on it breaks the standard.  The standard must be incredibly strong.  We broke off the gold standard because it wasn't strong enough.  Inflation targeting that we use today has the same inherit issues.  Bitcoin has the same problem, pressure from all angle to change what it is.  
People want to scale bitcoin to be a coffee money.  But the reality is that you need a stable secure technology, then it will be adopted as the new standard.  Out of this standard arises a superior money.
Manipulating this standard degrades the quality.  The historical problem, and Nash points this out, is that the ignorant masses, and the malicious actors will continually try to break the standard.
We watch Gavin, AA, Vorhees etc.  continually try to break it, as well as "big blockers".
I'm not always clear so glad we had some dialogue.

Ah so I did get this, I understood what you point to, but I don't understand the conclusion you have yet.  But this will make bohmian dialogue relevant.
We can both see the community and you have different definitions, but more imortantly there is no need to argue about who is right.  
We can both clearly see, I suspect, that there is simply a difference in perspective.
I don't mean this as spiritual whoo.  If we had the math (language), that represents perspective, and that math could show moving perspectives, and curved perspectives etc. we would be able to show the RELATIONSHIP between the different conclusions...
now if we can at all understand me.  Bohmian dialogue means, for me and you, or for the group, to explore the relationship of the perspectives...
in doing so, we move to a higher order.  The conversation changes.  The words change, the shared meaning changes...
Consensus, in the literal sense, a general agreement, becomes implied...
and then we move towards understanding implicate order: 
And I definitely would like to understand, how you stretch the community's definition to rather point to:


I suspect for you to bridge my, and others, understanding of consensus, might be helpful and valuable.

I can't do it so explicatly.  We need more back and forth dialogue so I  can understand who I am speaking to.  I will give you some more interesting quotes that are relevant and this particular set:


    …under extreme conditions the currency issued by a state could be exploited by parties not of that state as a sort of “safe-deposit box” on which they would not need to pay any rental fees or fees like those paid to the managers of mutual funds for investment.
    If the value trend of a currency is such that a natural interest rate is not negative, then it is not an unattractive task for a central currency authority to mint or print the physical currency that would circulate.  Then the issuer of currency would be partially in the position of a borrower not paying interest on borrowed money.
    …the issuer of a currency also needs to be properly prepared for the possibility of speculation on the part of interests domiciled in foreign states, etc., etc.
    But, simply to improve the conditions under which agreements regarding long-term lending and borrowing would be made, a money would be more or less equivalently good if it had a completely steady and constant rate of inflation.  Then this inflation rate could be added to all lending an borrowing contracts.  Hence, the problem of a money that would be too good is avoidable.
More: 
Nash DOES says what you point to, but then he explains that such a money would be politically impossible to achieve, so then he describes "asymptotically ideal money" as the process with which we can achieve it. Thx

Bitcoin is theoretically and practically secure.  There are solutions that provide this.  The rest that you suggest is the slippery slope we are supposed to avoid, and I hope Voorhees doesn't fall inline with ur sentiments.
Security is hard, but security solutions do not have security leaks.

coo you might like this... I think I understand though you mean something different between a deflationary period in the economy and bitcoin's nature as "deflationary" currency?  I mean bitcoin does have an inflation schedule right?
You can clear this up for me if I am mistake...
Now, in Nash's first published version of Ideal Money, he talks about how the evolution of an ICPI would "remove the role of the grand pardoners"  which is what you are referring to.
There is a very interesting point I can't get anyone to discuss (or at least point out the folly), this ICPI is a metric we cannot expose today because of the complex and oqaque nature of our financial system. As we evolve towards money with a higher quality (in relation to hypothetical ideal icpi) this metric will become relevant.  There is no pardon from propriety of a society that already has a taste of ideal money.

Why was there panic?

Also, perhaps I can be pointed to a simple explanation of the aspect of the model I don't understand.  I am generally not sure if I am confused about this.

Thankyou.  Ur the only one to respond, and I don't expect others to.  


I think this is what we are referring (we as in me now and you before) to.  I think you meant to tell me once on twitter that I don't understand consensus.  Of course I can look up a definition, but rather you are speaking from a perspective I want to understand.  I am curious for various reasons.
What do you mean to say in the above.  Is it that there need not be 100% agreement, or not some massive majority?  Or is it that once a decision is made, there is an assumed consensus going forward.  Or is it that going forward implies consensus, even if not everyone agrees the leader should be president going forward.  Or that they don't agree with his decisions, but its still consensus.
I think maybe you suggest a consensus without much agreement?
Maybe something else.


Satoshi presented a solution for the byzantine general problem that altered the frame with which the problem is perceived.  It's amazing to look back on of course, but I don't suspect it was so much a single flash of insight but different factors that came together in different ways...
Nonetheless we can understand that prior to this time, perhaps before the internet or when the internet was new, it was not possible to see the BG problem from the solvable perspective.  We continually asked the question from an unsolvable standpoint. 
Many players will be uninterested in my point.  They feel we have achieved or are nearing consensus.  They are blind by their want to argue others to an agreement.  There is much waste on these "contentious" issues.  We aren't working together, and to be honest I am convinced that knows that they have not kicked the hard fork down the road, but rather they have kicked the unsolvable debate down the road.
Do we see the danger, the disrespect, the carelessness, the dishonesty, the inefficiency of this?  Greg's "roadmap".  It's not a road map.  Am I the only one that reads only political content: 
There is also illogical economical thinking in his view.  Will he hear me point it out?
How do we reach consensus?  Consensus is agreement.  The entire nature of this problem is that we do not have a consensus mechanism. In the future bitcoin will BE that mechanism, but this is the nature of the problem.  We do not otherwise have technology for this NOW. 
So how Do we move forward.  We clearly need a higher order.  These players are stuck in the belief we must argue to reach agreement.  What irrational players.
Bohm's left us with a higher order consensus mechanism: 
To move to it.  To levate it, to use it.  That IS consensus.
Thank you for your time and any response.  I would also like to hear why you think Nash's Ideal Money is irrelevant.

@_date: 2016-04-15 15:02:49
We can note that bitcoin cannot have a high valuation by the markets if it is not secure enough to hold that much value.  The markets will "know" the truth of the security intuitively.  
I have an idea from this actually :)
Anyways, there is a belief that "free" or low fee transactions at a scale of visa, for coffee money, is the only path to this high valuation. But of course gold is not free at all to ship across the world, and its valuation is high.
Lastly, what does it mean to have a high valuation?  Bitcoin is very divisible. It is a very complex process of spreading it far enough across the citizens and players of the world.  
You do touch on price stability in regard to "malicious" players that might manipulate the markets in various forms.  I think its a valid view, but I think over time it will lose its relevance...
bitcoin has a steady schedule, the nodes and its users will fill up, and hit equilibrium. Each halvening increase the relevance like the introduction of a clock tower that was ignored at first.
Stability is not as easy to conceive as "price" I think, it takes on new meaning in the future as bitcoin becomes more relevant.

Here you are on the correct track.  When we don't decide we need to do this or that, we don't decide who's way is best, but rather we note the relationship between the two. We see it.  How silly is it to get stuck arguing over the same thing but from different perspectives?

It makes me think what ever caused us to support the notion of Jesus is the same phenomenon.  Maybe 1 man had an idea and a few good men helped create a myth to support it until it had its own steam.

And of the root of the meaning:




I respected your tone for whatever reason I just did (as in you came across sincere for some reasons).  However, I do, more than ever, think I understand that you DID mean to tell me I didn't understand the meaning of the word.  But rather I think that conflict is conditioned in you, and has become part of your nature.  Do you still feel that I don't understand the word consensus.   I sympathize from the fact that most people need to hear that consensus does not NECESSARILY imply unanimity.  But I also suspect you will change your tone and definition at least somewhat after actually looking at the various definitions. 
I get it, you have a computer science background and consensus has an implication of conflict.  But I think you will not go for in quantum computer science with this basis for perception. 
I am suggesting, Bohm leaves us a mechanism for a better understanding.  Bohm wrote of wholistic order.  I think it is fair of me to say you missed the implication of wholeness in the definition (this is different than me arguing for unanimity do we understand this?).
Is it relevant to say consensus doesn't imply unanimity?  or does the relevance lie in the highlighting of wholeness and:

Here is an example where portability is not one of the useful characteristics: 
(tl;dw = some tribes use money that is too big to use as a portable transferable utility.)
The rest of what you say also is not correct.  "Acceptability" is related to soundness not a component of it. Limited supply is not accurate, unmanipulatable supply is what is important in regard to the quality (aka honesty).  
You aren't quoting the economic science literature, you are repeating other users sentiments.  Like I said above, the complexity of the problem that money addresses is such that the average user CANNOT understand it.  
bitcoin needs to be free from manipulation, this includes trying to optimize the block-size.  Otherwise it is not an honest money, and this will show up in the price.  
Scaling bitcoin to try to increase the quality of it, degrades it.

They are tactics for winning debates, not having engaging dialogue.  I refuse to debate ignorance, and their is no debate among knowledgeable players. 
The goal of bitcoin is not a coffee money and it is not to set the price to the moon.  It is not to scale the block size to visa.  The goal is stability through security.
There is no problem with adoption to fix.  Everyone that starts with the conclusion bitcoin must be something it is not sees a false dilemma and engages in a non-sensical debate.

I cannot find another person that claims to have read and understood Nash's works Ideal Money, and especially who is also familiar with bitcoin and Szabo's works.  
For all I can tell Nash did all the philosophical meditation needed to create a concept of ideality for our money systems and he work laboriously to extrapolate a bridge from present day to such a future.  He does this is incredible detail but with his own style. 
His conclusion in an process of asymptotic evolution with the introduction of an international currency that is a politically  neutral technology. 






However for some reason I think more and more Finney was directly involved.  I think somehow Szabo was given plausible deniability even though he laid the academic and legal groundwork down for bitcoin.
Satoshi said the price of a commodities tends to gravitate down to production cost.  That is a key statement I feel like only one of these men would say in this context.  But Szabo's list of books to read involving Dawkins, Hayek, and the one on Metaphors really shows a proof of work that he is at least a main contributor to the ultimate bitcoin.pdf.
It makes sense that the whistle isn't blown in that there must not have been a wide variety of hands on the project yet it seems out of the scope of the various suspects to complete it on their own. 
Whether they are each capable or not, I do not believe they are stupid enough not to consult each other.  Finney is gone (for now!) and so since any of these men know how strong the conjecture must be to hold it makes sense to me he took many of the secrets with him.
I think then I only need to suggest Finney was meditating on Nash's works since the early 2000's: 


Nash, A Beautiful Mind, on which the current movie is based. Nash made
major contributions to economics among other fields before descending
into schizophrenia. But this list of his earlier character traits sounded
eerily familiar: 


these views. Attraction to Newton, Nietzsche, computers and science
fiction; exploration of drugs and supplements to enhance body and mind;
emphasis on rationality as a means to the truth; all are common elements
of Extropian thought.

bitcoin's do not exist and they do not move.  There is another example.
In regard to unmanipulable supply I am refering to bitcoin, I think you mean to say Satoshi is the manipulator, I mean to suggest supply of bitcoin can't be manipulated.
But we can take this further.  I even mean that a currencies what's supply is changed over time to target some targetable metric, is not being 'manipulated' but is in fact quite honest.
I think you will find I understand well enough, if you give it a chance (you seem to be).

Yes there are many different ones but you will find that there are people that are well read on the subject and those that are not.  I probably fall in the middle only but I suspect I am reasonably ahead of what could be called the ignorant mass.
Nonetheless you will find the well read seem to agree, security is the forefront consideration and scaling must be secondary.

I think at some time there was a perceived predictability to the supply of gold (or even oil perhaps in some senses), this I think is related to the cost of digging deeper.
But in regard to money, there is an announced intent for a 2-3% inflation rate, but there is also the competition between currencies on the markets and their relation to import/exports and so I think the targets and supplies are not so predictable.  


rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate
in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn't a rate
between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable? (The rate measured by

Its only a puzzle to you because you believe that bitcoin must be scaled so that people can use it.  The problem is, scaling it for this purpose destroys its integrity.  You must consider the possibility the former is false, before you will see I am not creating a puzzle.
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:52:18
I know but I feel the same. I don't like arguing versus ignorance.  Everyone can argue why bitcoin needs to be scaled, it NEEDS to be  MONEY, it HAS to be low FEES.  THEREFORE bitcoin needs to be  MONEY and MUST have low fees. I think its a silly argument you see?
Bitcoin's value is not as a money, and bitcoin will never be scaled to match visa.  That is fact.
Bitcoin's greatest value lies as a settlement system for nations, the introduction of a new standard.  
I don't have to convince you, we are watching it.  And no amount of petty arguing will change that.  
Satoshi's vision that bitcoin will not be a coffee money is holding perfectly true as he expected.

-A cryptography conjecture he sent to rand/nsa saying he has a remarkable discovery that must be guarded, that encryption will always out run decryption.  
-He showed the value of money in trade in the bargaining problem.
-He showed that all games of certain generic type have a solution, now called the nash equilibrium. This had missive ramifications in every field including war and economics. 
-He sent that memo on highly parallel computing where he notes the brain and computers are perfectly comparable and the goal is to decentralized control. 
-He came up with the basis of ideal money which is an unbreakable standard, like gold, but not gold, politically neutral and incorruptible.

Decentralized, implies an equilibrium that cannot be broken, otherwise for this context decentralized is only in a "moment" or a period of time that doesn't imply security. We decentralize power, create the optimal division of duty, and lock the divisions in equilibrium where no party can gain by defecting.  This is ultra security, and bitcoin is a perfect example of it. 
The American government system and its constitutional divisions are another example. 
Decentralization and security are very relevant to each other.  
HOWEVER. I see you observe "decentralization" to which you detest and I do not like the definition of. So I think we agree on something there, but I do not wish to suggest that what you say is decentralization is a representation of the word.  I think other groups have perverted it. 
So somewhere in their I think we actually agree.

If bitcoin's price stabilizes and doesn't grow that would be an amazing thing.  Nonetheless there are halvenings every 4 years so we know its value will grow in relation to supply.  Somewhere in their is a very useful metric but possibly not the moon rocket money that people wish it to be.

Yes I am interested in dialogue about this.  And I don't think you are correct, yet I can find a difference in perspective that would be the reason we don't see eye to eye.  for that it should be explored I think.
I need to also understand your definition of theoretical(ly) so I know exactly what you mean to say.  I will explain my understanding but even if it convinced you, I still want to hear yours and I will look at the slides for sure.
My understanding is that the way you arrange a problem effects the level of security your solutions might provide.  There is the possibility of re-arranging problems in such a way they facilitate the intended want, but without leaving the same issue of security to be solved (or rather providing a secure solution).
Szabo explains 3rd parties are security leaks.  I think I can refine his point further, because there are ways to arrange problems in such a way that 3rd parties are not leaks.  I do have an example that isn't relevant yet (I won't digress).
I don't think Satoshi would agree that bitcoin is not theoretically nor practically secure.  It seems to me the whitepaper suggested it will be both.  
I would also like to throw in our dialogue the concept of conjecturally secure.  Nash wrote the Nsa about a conjecture in which he said "although I cannot prove it, I expect it to hold true"  I don't think this means that it is not theoretically sound (we still have to mutually define theoretically).  I think a cutting edge insight has no ability to be expressed.  This might not sit well with you, but I don't mean to leave the realm of reason. I think Nash's sentiments in the letter he wrote support mine (observably).


I would have agreed with these sentiments, but they are not Vorhees from the blog.  He didn't seem to say this.  This is what I think he should have focused on and it doesn't surprise me you say it since you are clearly and authority (the good kind!) on the subject.  For this it seems the blog is bad pr.


There is security in this conjecture you put out here.  Nonetheless I have much to say also about the relation of this subject to the limitations in our cosmos.  I won't put them out because there is more tangible discussion to be had, but I resonate to bohm's work, and I think that we should stop debating block size and enter dialogue: 
I espouse bohm's work.  That will either likely interest you, or deter you from further dialogue.

Is it pretty layman stuff then? 
Theres something interesting in that memo.  He talks about how computers will be able to heal themselves as they out grow mans ability to think and solve problems we could never otherwise solve.  And then at the end his revelation is that the brain is a highly parallel set up.  He says it "Has to be", with is the mathematical equivalent of saying, "It's so obviously true to me I don't care to formalize it and test the theory" (he did this in another memo re: a cryptography conjecture saying "although I don't expect it to be proven I expect it to hold true")
Now if we follow the movie this isn't so interesting but if we know the real story, John Nash used his own brain to heal itself from his "dimensia".

Yes, but my point here is that if there is a hidden bug in the code, for example, then the markets will not invest in it.  In this way the markets are extraordinarily intelligent. They know things; they are clairvoyant.  
We have to tend to the security of bitcoin, not at all the transactability.

We should note that Szabo puts forth the acedemic argument that shows how bitcoin could possibly become a real money.  Shelling out and the Kula Ring conjecture are necessary arguments or bitcoin couldn't be discussed in the academic world.  Szabo bridges these concepts with Smith and Hayek and this is VERY important for bitcoin :)

@_date: 2016-04-15 16:23:00
It IS necessary isn't it? Perhaps more is needed, but we cannot do the "more" at the expense of security otherwise the necessity will wipe out the value. So all we have said is perhaps value cannot be created, nonetheless it is impossible to create at the expense of security.
@_date: 2016-04-23 08:10:42

Even if your math here holds, there is no suggestion that adoption is significant, not adoption for the purposes of bitcoin as a money in the coffee sense. Think of how many people use gold, very few.  The level of Gold's price is not so high because of the growing number of users, but rather its usefulness as an inflation hedge. This is different than its scalability in regard to transactions.
This is all easy to see.
@_date: 2016-04-24 00:25:18


Thank you.  Not just for this but for what else you point out that shows there is admission of intent to fork.  I understand the relationship between these points, but I could not sort out the noise so clearly as you have painted for me.  The core.org site is helpful but not as immediately clear as I expected.
Further, I see now you may have lost some relevance because of your stance, and I understand how you compromise out of sincerity. I spent a lot of time advocating no change, even though I'm not really a player in the game, I wished for balance in the argument, so I think we hope our original stances will bring a reasonable compromise about.


I can't agree with this at all on the face but it might just require clarification.  I don't know what community you refer to, perhaps you simply mean the intelligent players.  But my experience is all debates are wrought with ignorant newcomers that want to scale bitcoin to the moon, and this seems to be lead by players like Andreas and Evorhees, Gavin, Hearn etc. This side seems to be the majority, but again maybe you mean to speak about a higher level subset of relevant players (ie miners who actually get a vote).
But we still miss the most important two points.  First that Nash's 20 years of work's is very supportive of my line, which is fairly supportive of "our" resolved viewpoints (what me and you might choose as a compromise).  His works needs to be brought into the debate because it brings great support to reason.
I think collectively we don't know this.  I think few or none know the truth of it.
And Bohm's mechanism for consensus is also incredibly significant, I couldn't begin to explain the extent of why.  All these players are calling for a debate to end the conflict, its irrational, debate IS conflict.  Debate doesn't bring about consensus.  But dialogue of the bohmian kind will surely bring this about.  Dialogue highlights where different perspective is the true barrier to agreement, it also highlights malicious players in a way both sides can see.  Dialogue is a wholistic approach to problem solving.  It's the only mechanism we have available for consensus...but no players know about it, except maybe Trace Mayer (who can't possibly understand it).

Nope probably insecure models.  Here's my sentiments re: urs (


I think that power/equity has gone to your head, Andreas' head, and other's with similar sentiments: 
I want to hear Andreas say publicly that your business is still secure after being exploited by your head of IT.  I think you have explained this all in a way that appeases yourself, but it appears very shady to players that understand what decentralization means and how to properly use it.
Your collective sentiments are nonsensical,  you are all creating fud, and painting a counter-productive understanding of bitcoin for the community.  These sentiments are sending mass groups of troll out to try to dethrone theymos, who is the clear gatekeeper of sanity.  You don't understand economics.  You don't understand security, you don't seem to understand decentralization...

In fact I wager to suggest you perfectly highlighted the difficulty of Ideal Money, in the same way he does.  


But one cannot logically feel confident of the adoption internationally of an ideal system of currency or currencies in an achievement analogous to the achievement of the metric system or of “the euro”. Such a result would necessarily have a political content since it is the states that control and supply the various currencies that are in use at the present time.
The missing axiom is simply an accepted axiom that the money being put into circulation by the central authorities should be so handled as to maintain, over long terms of time, a stable value.
But a modern alternative is possible, one that would provide a good standard independent of state pardoners.  This idea occurred to me fairly recently.
There is more, that is relevant I hope you spend time with it.  cheers!

If you read the proposal its actually the obvious natural result and since much of bitcoin's perceived value is based on inflation expectation of fiat, if that fiat turns deflationary or less inflationary bitcoin isn't as skyrocket valuable so its not as hard as it seems.

@_date: 2015-12-19 00:54:03
We'll have to float tangentially in and out of each others perspectives otherwise I think nothing will make sense, and we can blame that on me if we want. 


These technologies are secure in regard to the peoples wants though, and there continued existence is a form of secure-ness.  Facebook isn't secure in mine and your eyes (prob) because it takes a ton of user data we don't realize, and it also causes people to leak a ton of info to other 3rd parties they are unaware of.  OTOH if facebook couldn't secure a botting or spam problem it might render it unusable for the users.


I don't know what you mean, or perhaps I don't know how you could suggest this.  We are watching over time, over the history of man evolution do exactly this.  In regard to the free market, there are some problems, like "what is the value of x", that an individual literally cannot solve. Only the markets can do that.  And in this I think there is the point that governments then cannot tell us what ideal money is because they themselves cannot solve the value problem.


I think there can be no reasonable argument why we should protect bitcoin from this.  Bitcoin should serve its purpose and we should eventually expect to evolve beyond it.  More importantly I think there is a great purpose for bitcoin that involves not much evolution, much like gold hasn't changed over the thousands of years we have honoured it. Coffee money needs to evolve, but a certain global standard for money should not.  The purpose of the latter is long term predictability.  We need something as a society that is long term predictable so that we are aligned on the same goal/standard. I also think for example the pyramids were this.  Society would argue forever about how to build them, what they should be, how long it should take, what block sizes should be, where they should be located etc. Complete infighting.  But once you lay the first layer of bricks (which is the largest layer!), who would continue to argue with what becomes increasingly obviously inevitable.  Also I think we should be able to see clear value in such a project in regards to predictability.  I don't know if I explained this well


In this regard I mean proof as in society is stupid as a whole, or young, or immature, or doubtful, or cautious.  These are all just metaphors.  Society will say the world is flat until you circumnavigate.  People will say a digital e-money could never work because governments will shut it down.  20 years Szabo design technology on topic of bitcoin's infrastructure, Nash spoke far beyond the point we are at today.  But society will always argue it can't exist until it does.


Agreed, if you mean its not the answer to a certain question you have in mind.  But I think it might be the answer to the question of "how to we force governments to evolve towards national fiats of ideal quality"


Agreed too, I think, if I understand you.  But we need to understand, like the markets that are needed to valuate commodities, creating the optimal currency, in regard to "ideal money" cannot be done but without the valuation of the markets. Its a really a strange proposal then but also a clever solution I think (or obvious but strangely perfect to us average peoples).  And this is what the average bitcoiner does not seem to understand.  It isn't enough to say, just make bitcoin cheap to use, and then everyone will use it.  That would be obvious, but the introduction and implementation in relation to what exists and is real doesn't necessarily allow for that.  I think Satoshi clearly knew this (I also think Szabo knows this, I also suspect Craig Wright DOESN'T know this). So really when I see a community full of peoples with pitchforks, pushing infinite sized blocks, crucifying theymos I think I understand why. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:45:03
Just some quotes from Ideal Money for reference, sorry if its not interesting:








(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.
(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be “politically appealing.” so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.
(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.


@_date: 2015-12-28 03:49:14


@_date: 2015-12-20 22:37:44


There is a form of limitation though that highlights the purpose of gold. From Ideal Money:
"It is a coincidental fact that the inherent nature of mining and mining technology makes it possible for the prices of certain commodities that are produced as a result of the devotion of labor and capital to the effort of mining to increase less (or decrease more) than might be expected.  There is a “dimension paradox”: Agricultural products are produced by using the two-dimensional resource of the earth surface, so the “disappearing frontier” creates a limitation. In contrast, some mining, particularly for elemental metals, can essentially be done in three dimensions, although, of course, there are increasing costs for deep digging."
Nash's concept for ideal money is from the 1960's.


" After writing and speaking on a concept of "Ideal Money" which was itself arrived at after many years of meditation I now have also thought of a parallel concept which relates to political realities, psychology influencing the actions of politicians and voters or citizens, and which provides a concept of what may actually transpire in the evolution of customs and culture (as it were) relating to money."
"The ultimately launched concept of "Ideal Money" became possible when I conceived of a practical basis for a standardization of the comparison of the value of the currency with an appropriate standard or ideal."
" But one cannot logically feel confident of the adoption internationally of an ideal system of currency or currencies in an achievement analogous to the achievement of the metric system or of "the euro". Such a result would necessarily have a political content since it is the states that control and supply the various currencies that are in use at the present time."
"if, say, an inflation rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn't a rate between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable?"
"...the U. S. dollar is not an ideal standard for money value. "
"...if, for example, all of the countries of the world would base the value for their national currencies on the value of the british currency then this situation would appear singular and unstable, while it was not so singular for a lot of countries to base their currency value on gold."
"The metric system does not work because french chefs de cuisine are constantly cooking up new and delicious culinary creations which the rest of the world then follows imitatively. Rather, it works  because it is something invented on a scientific basis"
"then the limiting or "asymptotic" result of such an evolutionary trend would be in effect "ideal money" but this as a result achieved without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for the standard of value.

No not at all.  In fact you debunk yourself. Bitcoin DOES work without an increase, I have proof.  There can be NO PROOF it can work well or better with an increase without TRYING it first.  No logic can be proof.  So there is only proof not to change it. It MIGHT be better if we changed this or that...but that’s a different argument for a different purpose.


No currency of this kind can ever beat bitcoin's proof of work.  Bitcoin will always be first and the most tried tested and true.  And none of this goes against bitcoin's network effect.  Network effect speaks to its adoption, which is working fine.  No currency can be better at bitcoin at being first. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:27:22
There are a few important considerations in what you suggest. Firstly its kind of subject to suggest bitcoin can handle "more" compared to "current tech".  But maybe you have some reasonable parameters in mind. How can we "hard code" the future of technology into our choice?  Especially given the possibility that our decision on how to formulate the future of bitcoin will have an effect on the types of hard ware that might arise in relation to it (if 1mb was forever i suspect lightning channels would be quite favorable socially).  We do have moore law, and I think Satoshi did formulate bitcoin with it in mind, but its really an approximation and I don't think we can expect it to remain accurate for very long in the midst of a technological revolution.
 Lastly and most important I think, it might not be very much more useful to rescale bitcoin to fit our best guess at how our technology might advance.  It might be more useful for bitcoin as X, but not much more, yet it might not really effect bitcoin as Y.  Bitcoin as Y might already be the best use for bitcoin.  Bitcoin as Y might need need to be formulated to scale like x. 
Its another way of saying, scalability isn't as important as stability.

Satoshi said bitcoin is in good hands with Gavin.  I think they he is gavin because if people found it this would be an unstable thing to do (it would look bad on bitcoin in the future).
I don't think Nash is Satoshi.  One good example is when he said "if you don't get it I don't have time to teach you"  Nash wouldn't say that, but I do believe Szabo would. 
Perhaps nash wasn't involved at all.  But I think anyone with half a brain that could bring bitcoin to life would consult Nash.  I think he was consulted in 1990's.  
Perhaps there is no connection at all.  Any combination would be strange based on the facts that I know. It would be a tragedy to not consult nash though.

@_date: 2015-12-18 08:30:59
Perhaps but I am talking about reality, and today we have governments and central banks that are massively in the way of this change.  Furthermore, and more importantly, bitcoin can't continue to have mass adoption AND serve as a gold standard 2.0.  What I mean to say is gold had a certain stability in its value, and by everyones definition of "bitcoin needs adoption to fuel price; price fuels adoption" bitcoin would never have that stability as an ever growing gum/coffee money.  So I think it can't do both.
Then I think we would have a chance for this:


 &gt;  So it occurs to me to think that that which is not achieved by a grand action of establishment by "fiat" may alternatively tend to come into existence as a consequence of a process of evolution. And of course, after a certain degree of progress by "evolution" the rest of the progress could possibly be realized by a convention or 
a process of "fiat".
@_date: 2015-12-19 07:54:54

This is an explanation I needed (the article).  To help make some points and further discussions I am having.  It shows a different purpose and utility for bitcoin than what the general public thinks it is (whether bitcoiners or people who don't know much about bitcoin).
I from this light bitcoin can be shown to be useful in the sense gold maybe have been historically, or metals, or a basket of commodities.  
I think Bitcoin and its supply is not "ideal" in the sense of being a constant pricing system for all time, but it gives the possibility for all fiats to and governments to join an incorruptable standard that is predictable enough to bring great value to such change.

I might not understand you, but in regard to what I am thinking, you are a stuck in a box of thinking how bitcoin should function as a transferable utility.  If bitcoin can function like a gold standard, then all of the governments will be forced to print money in relation to this standard.  
that would be a FAR better use case than buying a pack of gum.
To me it seems you (representing a certain population of bitcoiners) are stuck on measuring bitcoin's utility as a money, but thats only 1 use case.

@_date: 2015-12-28 03:16:10


I think this is a significant thing to point out.  To me this suggests that the concept/proposal Ideal Money John Nash was talking about really could possibly hinge on using bitcoin as a standard that all fiats might compete against. 
Nash went into a lot of detail about the relationship between production of commodities and what could be ideal for transferable utility. He seems to outline exactly what you do but from different perspectives. He dances around all of this in what I can only suspect to be "his style" of attacking problems and solving them.


I don't think there are many people out there that are pointing this out.  I think its true too but from what I read it is smart by design and he never really emphasized the truth of this double sided nature of bitcoins parameters (supply). Nash talks about this specifically which is at the least somehow amazingly ironic.  He talks about the issuer of a money and even of the electronic kind, and what different pitfalls one might have as well as how they could be addressed. 
The way you put things is quite peculiar to me, I wouldn't know why without background.
Most people feel Nash's proposal was to link money to an optimal industrial consumption price index (ICPI), but this is only a side point that Nash makes that this COULD be defined as Ideal Money.  I think rather his point is that money that is ideal would be comparable to such a system.  He goes on to explain how this would be politically infeasible since there is a natural tendency for governments or nations to serve their individual purposes and wants etc.
But you must know also what he points out as well, that government inflation targeting schemes are not properly forward looking as they claim and the statistics for measuring inflation are somewhat malleable as well.  It's another way of highlighting Hayek's point I think that central banks cannot actually achieve the stability they claim to be "targeting".  
Nash says "aha" and here is the inspiration for "asymptotically ideal money" which is another topic he dances around talking about how printing money does effect the quality of it in regard to the inflation.  He goes on to suggest new international money might arise and that the peoples, like players of a game, will have ability to choose which currency is most favorable to them. 
I think the insight here is that Hayek points out only the markets are powerful enough and have enough information to properly evaluate our commodities, and the concept of "ideal money" suggest that only the markets can (and will) be able to properly evaluate our currencies. 
With an incorruptible standard that bitcoin could be as you describe it to be better than gold. It seems bitcoin is a catalyst for that game to begin, as well as providing the transferable utility for the players in it.  One of Nash's explicit side streets is about how by adding a transferable utility to a game you create a situation in which all the players can gain on average.
And so the ultimate evolution of this, as I understand it, is a money that is comparable to a money that is linked to an optimized icpi, but without actually creating an icpi.
The purpose of the proposal and its significance imo are that we are to think about and discuss this natural process of economic evolution well before we expect it to take place.  Opening the discussion is a crucial step towards cooperation and success for Ideal Money to finally be brought about.  
curious if you have thoughts on this, don't find many people who comment on it....

Yes I definitely polarize it on purpose, but so do the vast majority of "coffee money blockers".  Their argument is if bitcoin can't be used for daily purchases then it cannot survive.  There is also a big difference between bitcoin for the purpose of a settlement layer vs a coffee money, i think, in regard to its relationship with the global financial system.
In this, I suspect that implementation doesn't really allow for cake and eating the cake.  
But I also think this would fundamentally change the debate if it were valid.

I understand that you get this, and many or some others as well. But collectively we are still thinking and offering solutions that try to "out game" the bots. But bots, we know, are the very thing that are starting to out game humans. The solution MUST be to incentivize them to cooperate for the integrity of the network. That equilibrium is exactly the genius behind bitcoin and it is clearly the only theoretical solution. Any other direction is just not understanding this.
The thing is that the majority if not all public bots that are running today are very much detectable because they are fairly new. In general "bots" are in the infancy years and even bots for popular games are considered the same because not much years have been spent on them compared to other areas in programming.
Yes and the system I propose as an addendum to "pokererum" (which I highly advise you find and read if you or others haven't) solves "gto" undetectable bots. I only do this because then the solution is 100% secure. Pokerereum developers for example did not at all address this as I understand (and they have expressed to me). It is also a great way, as I understand, to solve problems, by thinking of theoretical optimums and extrapolating solutions from the direction they lie in.
Nobody is going to be playing poker by the time we have these brain chips because there will be better things to do and currency will be worthless.
Well it might be fun to theorize and philosophize about but I think in our (natural) lifetime poker will in fact be a relic or a tradition that will continue on. Under my understanding not only can anyone host a NLHE or PLO game with a standard deck but rather all variations of games based on all decks. Peoples talk about poker dying, but really we haven't even begun to explore card games of hidden information in this regard.
I'm curious to why you have to make new accounts all the time.
I'm not sure I understand the question fully, I feel like i have something to offer the community, unfortunately others don't...I guess you've decided I don't (certainly you've called attention to me, where as I just try to be sincere and fit into the discussion, and offer any info I feel is valuable.).

You have to find me someone else who was suggesting for the last 50+ years that we are going to end the practices of central banking that manipulates the supply of the currencies against the longterm will of the peoples. Nash makes sense to us to some degree.  But before bitcoin there would be no way to make sense of him suggesting that keynesian economics is going out the window.

What I'm proposing is increasing the size for the purpose of mass adoption has no reasonable utility but a circular argument.
What I am pointing out, is if bitcoin CAN'T run at full block size, then the markets will adjust and there will simply only be less transactions than full.  There is no problem, expect people that want bitcoin to have more adoption, but because of what I point out, they have no significant argument for why.
@_date: 2015-12-20 08:12:54
You skimmed it, it seems.  Nash explains  money COULD be, or WOULD be ideal if it were linked to an ideal industrial consumption price index.  And he says ideal money is money that doesn't lose its value over time. But in this sense the ICPI is really sort of a red herring (and possibly politically corruptible).  
Its really a fancy way of saying if you had a machine that could adjust the quality of money, you COULD actually hit the "ideal" (which would coincidentally be comparable to an ideal ICPI).  He also makes a point that our governments or central banks (claim they) try to do this.
But the standard they are shooting for is also a corruptible metric. 
"National" Ideal Money is not so useful for the world because its bound to be based on a corrupted standard.  Money based on another nations standard then is susceptible to the same corruption.  Gold was a suitable standard in the past but Nash points out we have outgrown it for various reasons. 
I think for the aspects Nash pointed out that could serve as a basis for a possible standard, I think bitcoin may serve as a gold 2.0 (depending on how its structured and what its future holds).  And so there is the possibility that as we evolve towards this standard each fiat will show its true colors and either evolve with the trend and be wiped out.
Then at some point it might be politically feasible to begin the fiat process for Ideal Money, creating a global standard with no "grand pardoners".
This is the world Nash painted.

@_date: 2015-06-15 20:27:13
This is the philosophy/theory behind the setup as I understand it: 
**The Future Model for Poker Sites**
Poker players need a profitable game in order to secure the integrity of it. Having a profitable game to a certain extent and beyond, arises the inevitability that “malicious players” will use bots for maximum profits.  These bots will be maximally scaled for maximum profits for the malicious player/party that sets up the bots.
This is not unlike today’s massive stables run by large staking entities. A new game like “spin n go” arises and stakers/coaches seek to exploit the profits and change to the maximum degree. Just like large staking groups, bots will inevitably bring the profitability of the game down to a certain level.  Any solution to the technical flaws or economic systems of the game should take both these phenomenon into account.
**Profitability IS Security**
There are a few major complaints that have been growing in the consciousness of the collective players over time.  Software advantages are often discussed by players as something that gives certain players an unfair edge over others.  This is much like another issue that is becoming more and more a reality-bots.  These two issues are also very inter-related with the possibilities of collusion amongst players or bots. However these issues should not be the TRUE concern in the eyes of the individual or the collective player.  Truly the only issue that matters here is the profitability. If a certain game is profitable for the individual, and especially more profitable than today’s current equivalent, then why should this player care if there is any human players at all?!
**Private Games are the Future of Poker**
In the diagram of decentralized serverless poker, there is a distinction made between private games and public games.  Private games simply require an invite of some sort and public games are more of the wild west with randomized seating.  Randomized seating solves the problem of collusion PROVIDED one party doesn’t hold a major economic majority of the entire field.  Although unlikely such a situation could be solved further, much like bitcoin’s 51% attack, by decentralizing the major bot/staking pools that might arise.  There is a basic formula here, an equation to see and to balance, in how profitable a game might be, in relation to n pools of bots/staking groups.
**Bots (and Players) as Nodes**
The basic change from the present model to a conceived future model is that players are to act as nodes to hold up the integrity of the network rather than the traditional centralized server model nearly all sites use today.  Players essentially are then able to set up and cryptographically deal/verify their own games rather than using the more expensive traditional model of “contracting” third party trust for such verification.  The new model elects random jury’s from the entire pool to verify different aspects of the entire system.  PROVIDED, the majority of the jury pool isn’t owned by a single entity, such a method can be theoretically secure.
Once again this highlights the need for a decentralized field as describe previously.
**The Future Model of Sites**
Provided this P2P layer exists much of the existing overhead disappears from site models. There is still much need for attracting types of player pools.  There may still be a need for other types of security solutions, however, these solutions can now be more tailored, less costly, and have the advantage of a more rapid evolution since the entry to implementation will be so much lower.
**Incentivizing Bots and Malicious Entities to Cooperate**
Now we have an economy in which there can be brought about an equilibrium that might prove favorable for the future of poker. Since bots can be used as verification nodes that hold up the integrity of the games (ie cryptographic dealing), it makes economic sense to use them for these purposes rather than expensive third party solutions.  On the other hand such nodes will not cooperate or participate without the proper compensation. Truly it matters not (in this context) these bots/node earn this compensation through actual gameplay, rakeback, direct payments, or shares/crypto-coin etc. This suggests there IS a great equilibrium to be found. The bots require a certain profit to verify the private game pool, and such a profit can be realized through a system equivalent to today’s rake/rakeback systems.
**The Importance of Effective Rake as a Metric and Free Market Competition**
The concept of Effective Rake plays an important but hidden role here.  Because bots can certainly act as nodes, and will also necessarily be the most profitable players in the public games AND if much of the “kick back” from private games could be paid back through a type of rakeback program, there is now levated the possibility of an effective rake standard for the public games. This entire system assumes (and indeed theoretically provides!) a certain context of free market competition where the verification nodes/bots “out-bid” each other to offer the most cost efficient solution (this suggests a lower consumer price because of such competition between node pools).
What is important to note is the effective rake becomes defined as the market equilibrium and thus is a product of competing forces rather than an actual metric to be “predicated” and then achieved through “policy”.
**Isn’t Ideal Poker “Rake-Less”?**
Truly the future of poker is to involve a great change in perception and also the intelligence and direction in which the entire collective of the poker community might function. This “function”, is and will be seen as, truly a product of the nature of rake.  When rake is allowed to be high, we will see a very perturbed society, that is not very interested in the inner workings (and macro) of the economics of the game. As rake asymptotically slides towards zero, we will expect to see a greater and greater change in this context.  As life gets breathed into the game, so too will it attract the intelligent and creative minds that gave it its first successive generations of booms.  The system described here, is both the catalyst a ultimately symptom of the beginning of the realization and implementation of such a change.
Ideal Poker IS rakeless from the players perspective. Ideal-ness one can note, is also conceptual and theoretical.  What we propose is to begin to define such an ideal and (only then can we) begin to move in that direction.

I think I show very well he has missed the decentralist perspective. Its not my system he comments on.  Its an actual paper i think by mit or something.  But there is a very special argument imo.  You can solve mental poker, or the p2p exchange of hidden cards in a deck etc. But gavin wants to say you can't solve cheating ie sharing cards via some messenger service.   I basically argue that is a right that should remain free.  I think that stands on its own, but...
We can further project an infrastructure designed to support that point and/or one designed with a certain profit standard...
and then I think we see a new world.

Lemme paraphrase his work.  Nash suggest we need to think about money like a tele-communitcations.  He believes that an internationl money might arise in the form of a money with a stably issued supply.  He suggests Keyneisan doctorine has taught us less is more and bad money is better than good money.  He defines Keynesian as the belief than central banking should control our money systems.  He suggest a revolution will happen that will cause the citizens of the currencies to be able to properly value their fiat and will thus put pressure on governments who will eventually fin they have no ability to make monetary policy.  He suggest the citizens might have alternative places to put their money.

One of the reasons peoples and computer scientists alike are so excited about bitcoin is its ability to solve exactly all of this. Bitcoin itself is basically a giant decentralized database in ledger form. The incorruptible block chain that it forms is much a p2p decentralized data base that in one sense perfectly addresses your concerns here.
Moreover there are new solutions, that use the blockchain and are SPECIFICALLY designed for mass data storage. Szabo whom is well known for the mastermind and also for many related papers which includes explanations on new technology based on the block chain such as a data storage service has designed all this many years ago. Pokerereum's solution utilizes this.
Part of the amazing aspects of this is that you CAN actually create algorithms through something called "smart contracts" (secure open source automated programming), that can search such data WITHOUT revealing to ANYONE anything that should be considered private. In today's model, sites like PS see your data and have access to it in exactly the way you are protesting.
So in short, using this p2p blockchain tech, we CAN actually have our cake and eat it too.
What we really need to (and will) start to understand is a centralized contracted security service is a GIANT leak/cost from the player's perspective. Third parties are in fact themselves security leak holes, as we consistently find out.
Money doesn't come from thin air, but I understand where money comes from far better than you, whether it be of the paper/fiat kind or the cypto kind. What is suggested here is simple the addition of share of a decentralized network paid out to the losing players. The "value" that fuels all this is simple being siphoned from the current existing inefficiencies of the centralized status quo models. I have maths to show the value but its kinda useless without links.

Ya shit I don't have text to quote for it.  Basically he notes its interesting you can control inflation by effectively control the supply like "prints".  Then he suggests an international money might somehow come into existence.  He talks about how the public will better learn to understand their monetary policies how how to valuate their respective currencies in relation to each other.

It seems to me there is only such a scaling problem depending on your philosophy for bitcoin.  So I'm suggesting the possibility that these peoples still believe bitcoin is fine, but that its ultimate ideal use is NOT for coffee transactions. 
We need two things 1) A world standard 2) A decentralized currency
Its not necessarily true it is possible or correct at this point that bitcoin becomes BOTH of these things. I'm simply suggesting adjusting block size to make bitcoin the ideal currency, ignores the most immediate issue we have in this world, which is lacking an INCORRUPTIBLE standard. 
Bitcoin as an ideal currency is something we know we want, but it might be necessary to solve the need for such a standard FIRST. In other words we are living in a world of crypto and digital money solutions, but the world is still stuck in a horrible economic war that bitcoin as an ideal currency doesn't fix or even address.  
In this, scalability doesn't seem to be the most important issue.

The flow chart is just a slight mod on how I think the Pokereum solution is supposed to work.  I haven't communicated well with this team so I am not sure about either my understanding of their works or my "tweak".
I'm going to write up an explanation, but the idea is that if poker is a profitable game then bots will naturally arise as a type of attack on the game.  This solution I drew above uses private games as the barrier for bots while paying bots as nodes to hold up the integrity of the private game using the jury pool system that pokereum has used in their solution.

I can only make conjecture. I suspect its because he knew this debate was coming.  I think that the worry was if he presented bitcoin as a settlement system there would be no adoption from people like you.  And you share the masses opinion on what bitcoin should be. So he VERY carefully wrote the .pdf in this regard.
I also ask you, if in your opinion, he EXPLICITLY says bitcoin should be a coffee money in the FIRST line of the .pdf then why is there  a massive debate on the issues and meetings about it all over the world?  
Shouldn't you be emailing Nick Szabo and pointing out the debate is solved?  
Its not that simple.  We all love the idea of bitcoin as the new visa, but its far more complex like that.  There is a real world global financial system it must evolve in relation to.
I know you are also talking about when he said something like: If we want to scale bitcoin it can be done like this X over Y period etc.
But I also have blogged and highlighted the EXACT quotes, and again he wasn't explicit AT ALL about any intention or rush to scale to visa.
IN FACT multiple peoples cried out to Satoshi immediately pointing out the 1mb cap will lead to an unsolvable debate that might make ANY change difficult or impossible...
Satoshi didn't respond to those complaints, but I think its likely he read them.

Thank you for your time.


This is key, and I think you read and interpret well.  It seems to me what is inline with Hayek and somewhat a clever extension of Hayek.  We know the markets are the optimal pricing mechanism, and so what Nash says as the methodological approach we need to arrange the markets to answer the question of "what is ideal", rather than have banks arbitrarily try to achieve it through policy.
He does re-affirm a contrasting point though, after much of his essay's explain the sort of evolution of gresham's law:






This is where we forget that bitcoin must evolve in the real world, and the real world systems were built by self interested peoples and are self interested entities.  Nash (and Szabo for that matter) seem to remind us that our money systems are not just personal and individual but also function to serve relations between nations.  There are great purposes for this notably including how the bretton woods system was setup to prevent another world war.
I don't think you exactly forget about it, but you just probably don't know Nash goes extensively into the game theoretical drama that might unfold between many of the different types of actors involved in money and governance. 
He does also explicitly go into the benefits of gold but also where it fails.
The money market can't achieve stability because at certain times instability is favourable to different regimes and entities. 
Nash's ultimate ideal money creates a standard of value which he suggest will erase the role of "grand pardoners", so really the concept needs to be unbreakable, and it will ultimately stabilize our global economy and end "crashes" in the massively unfavorable sense.


What you say here is reasonable and he addresses it well too I think.  One thing you might have thought or mentioned to that he suggests is that there is an effect on the cost of living in regards to say robots:


 But your points about the population only necessary hold true I think under a Keynesian system and not a nashian one.  Remember things like behavioural economics are what Nash revolutionized, and he talks a lot about the psychological of the citizenry especially in relation to a probabilistic future:


I think he rightfully paints a society that approaches the game of "savings" and "investing" quite differently.


The ICPI is described in various writings in detail and is purposefully constructed over the most sort of decentralized politically neutral values. But please don't miss the point I was getting at.  He also explains the possibility of simply levating money of an ideally strong character (Ideally in the sense it WOULD be comparable to money linked to an optimal ICPI!) but without an actually ICPI:


locally by national CPI indices that then also these distinct currencies would tend to evolve towards more stable comparative relations of value.
    Then the limiting or "asymptotic" result of such an evolutionary trend would be in effect "ideal money" but this as a result achieved without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for the standard of value.
I suspect you would be quite interested in reading through his works.

I guess my short point is that Nash seems to construct a concept of an ideal ICPI that serves the same purpose that Oleg suggest bitcoin is optimal for (ie gold 2.0)...and then he goes on to explain how the ICPI won't be needed and yet how the world will evolve to the same standard and eventually to money that perfectly reflects a theoretical ideal ICPI.

I suspect you have struck the heart and truth of the matter, except I don't think you were lied to, I think we deceived ourselves. Everyone has been thinking of bitcoin in terms of themselves and not thinking about the big picture. 
I also think this hits the core of the argument proposed by Nash: 
I do believe the bitcoin elite understand this very well also, except because of the importance of decentralization and consensus they mustn't focus on their own understanding of bitcoin, even though it might be obviously theoretically correct. 
In other words it might be economically correct and obvious that bitcoin should be more toward the role gold plays today and less like a cash system HOWEVER it is still the collective PEOPLES that ultimately decide and NOT the scientists/elite. 
The debate has become part of the experiment, just as much about block-size as is about possibilities of consensus (or not). 
Perhaps rather ‘Stability and Consensus’ is “Ideal”?

I won't be able to source it unfortunately, but my understanding is that the problems that bitcoin's implementation solved, such as byzantine consensus, are done in such a way that the system won't sustain an equilibrium if the block size is set to "discovery" of it.  Its another way of saying if we knew the future of bitcoin and our society we could optimize bitcoin's block size, but we don't.
I do not remember where I saw the math behind this, but as I understand it, many people who want a dynamically optimized limit, also don't realize why there is a serious discussion on the issue at hand.
Basically that a market set equilibrium will cause the floor to fall out on the value of bitcoin. I'm sure you aren't happy with that explanation but maybe you will look into the plausibility of it.

And why is Satoshi Nakamoto so drastically close to T.Okamoto + Nash =  SatosHi   NAkamoto
I realize I have thought about this too long, and maybe its total unrelated coincidence but:
   &gt; What then is the **ideal cash** system? The criteria describing the ideal cash system are as follows:
    (a) independence: The security of electronic cash cannot depend on any physical condition. Then the cash can be transferred through networks.
    (b) Security: The ability to copy (reuse) and forget the cash must be prevented.
    (c) Privacy (Untraceability): The privacy of the user should be protected. That is, the relationship between the user and his purchases must be untraceable by anyone.
    (d) Off-line payment: When a user pay the electronic cash to a shop, the procedure between the user and the shop should be executed in an off-line manner. That is, the shop does not need to be linked to the host in user’s payment procedure.
    (e) Transferability: The cash can be transferred to other users.
    (f) Dividiability: One issued piece of cash worth value C (dollars) can be subdivided into many pieces such that each subdivided piece is worth any desired value less than C and the total value of all pieces is equivalent to C.
    In this paper, we have proposed the first ideal untraceable electronic cash system…

@_date: 2015-06-23 23:04:39
I can appreciate your post and have skimmed it, for is relevant to my understanding.  You have outlined some of what I have but you have also missed something I think you and others might think relevant:
Firstly John Nash, through his lectures ideal money, has extensively gone over the history of money in relation to the specific problem of what would be ideal for today's circumstances.  To me this is something that cannot be over looked and specifically addresses this debate:  
I believe the specific argument is that the world needs an incorruptible gold standard before it can have this money that has an intrinsically stable quality that we should all be seeking.
Secondly, and this might address some of your points and paradoxes, I think the intelligent elite in the bitcoin community understands this, but in the spirit of decentralization they also understand that this argument must be FULLY exhausted before it can be truly said that the fate of bitcoin is stable.  In this the stability of bitcoin is truly tied to the peoples psychology. 
I suspect consensus for ideal change cannot happen, and rather it will be only possible or easier to show that the argument, much like greece/euro, is in a perfect deadlock.  Only by addressing the obvious deadlock together can we move forward.  I think this all explains much of your "fear/good points"
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:39:43
We meant, the author and the reader, in this context. 


Yes I meant to comment on the above, if i understand you, I think that there is a chance now to take the power from just the miners and distributing it between the users of the currency as well as the miners.  This seems better than just the miners having this ability. 


It might be rather that bitcoin's specialty and power lies in its stability and inability to be changed. In this it would remain an incorruptible bearing point for out civilization. To argue, you or someone might ask, is it possible we could make the wrong decision about block-size and doom our civilization, or in other words, if we don't reach consensus now, and that might mean we can never reach consensus (because consensus is harder as adoption increases), is there a danger of not making consensus for change while it is possible?
I'm not so worried there is such a danger.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:05:25
I think its a useful article, I don't agree with all of the sentiments though.


I think there is not rational or favorable argument, from the peoples perspective or the "citizens" of the world, to suggest that we should be tending to the businesses that may have bought into a system for characterises that the system did not actually have, or would not have in the future. Some businesses made good decisions, and some businesses made bad decisions. With not reason to favor the bad decisions, there is no reason to favour the blocksize debate outcome that supports them.
I think it would be an anti-capatilistic point to make.  
 &gt;As noted here, inaction changes bitcoin, sets it on a new path.
I think that this is also logic that even Gavin wouldn't be comfortable going into.  bitcoin's block size was set to 1mb a long time ago.  The markets make their decisions based on what the perceived future IS, not what it might be.  Satoshi suggests we might increase the size later, but the markets are to know better than the individual that read his words. If bitcoin is to be stuck at 1mb, or some block size Gavin feels is inferior, then that was its true intention all along.  It cannot be said then that inaction is a new path.  The outcome is the path it was to be on all a long, and we should always favor the market participants that correctly deduced this from the beginning. 


It clearly is.  bitcoin cannot be tested in a lab, and it is the first version of a test that must show its results in real use. I might be failing here with my definitions of academic and science.  But clearly bitcoin could never be a fully tested theory without real world implementation. 


We should also be talking about risk of changing block size in ways that we shouldn't be.


It was always my understanding, and I could be wrong because clearly these sentiments disagree, that a dynamically optimized limit is economically impossible. In fact it seems quite likely to me this would have been implemented quite early on if it was at all possible. Also I don't think that such an algorithm perfectly removes the long term moral hazard nor puts such things outside of human hands. 
This is where the importance of disagreeing about bitcoin being an academic projects comes into play.  I think Gavin wants to point out that bitcoin CAN be broken and that has real world implications, whereas I mean to point out that if someone proposes a good algorithm, I cannot put my faith in it like bitcoin until such an algorithm has the proof of work bitcoin does. 
Human hands that create algorithm's I think are something we need to be far more cautious about than letting the markets play out while bitcoin takes the course it was always on anyways-what ever that is.  To truly take the humans out of the equation I think is to leave the nature of bitcoin alone, not try to change it.

1) For humans to live, co-habitate, and create a thriving sustainable civilization, 3 (possibly) scare resources are needed: Food, Shelter from the environment, and Fresh water.
2) These 3 crucial resources can either be secured in a civilization’s own lands or bartered for.
3) Nick Szabo’s Kula Ring conjecture shows how money itself might arise from a coincidence of these (or other) wants.
4) The four color map theorem states: “…given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.”
5) A Nash Equilibrium occurs when “…no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium.”
This suggests then on a plane/surface, such as the surface of our planet and in relation to the “nature and causes of “wealthy nations”, there is necessitated a minimum of 4 main distinct “resources” (food, shelter, fresh water, “money”) needed to create a natural and basic equilibrium for stability.

ah.  thank you, you post with a different tone than others.  I think you are on a right track in some regards but also in some its not so right.  We have some ideas how much is left, but much of it is too costly, technological not possible yet, or sometimes politically difficult to get to.   I think you mean to say bitcoins supply is more steady.  but i think what we are missing here is that effectively gold is somewhat predictable in supply historically because although there is much more gold, there is only so much of its that is feasible at a time (in the future comets will be feasible).  
so gold fit that bill for its time period of a commodity that had an supply throttle because of cost..maybe?

In regard to prices and markets, of course we agree, but if commodities are priced well, but for example in usd, what does that mean going forward?  If the standard unit, whether USD or any other currency is itself manipulable and not very predictable then these prices aren't so useful (and imo opinion will be skewed by the markets ill attempts to properly valuate the commodities).

@_date: 2015-12-18 20:24:36
I just wonder if we aren't going about this the wrong way.  A full implementation of p2p poker perfectly solved is important for many reasons beyond simply decentralizing poker. But in regard to what the players need for their current environment (Amaya/Poker Stars owns &gt; 70% of the market share) is far less than a fully solved MP implementation. 
Of all the projects I can find, each is trying to be a new site, that implements a fully secure solution to this problem.  
But I think there might be a possibility of presenting an insecure solution, that allows the markets to "game" the rest of the way.
I think bitcoin.pdf is comparable, in that Satoshi provided a transferable utility but not the wallets or the banks that support bitcoin. These things evolved along the way eventually finding their own security solutions. 
Also the poker industry, even from the players view point, doesn't need to completely solve the problem of trusted third parties, especially with bitcoin in the mix. It already functions WITH trusted third parties (obv not optimally though).
But we could sure use a server-less implementation/infrastructure, which I think would be a massive cost reduction (especially in regard to barriers to entry for competing sites) which would eventually be passed onto the customer/player.

I have a thought here (tangential admittedly).  I think you are suggesting either with adoption/use comes a greater price, and/or with a greater price comes more adoption/use.  Obviously we are being fundamental and simplistic but a large correlation appear to be there, which is promising and fun.
How do you feel then about the suggestion that there is a certain amount of adoption that would keep bitcoin's price stable. 
We tend to talk about creating a world currency that needs mass adoption to skyrocket the price. 
What happens if we believe bitcoin wouldn't/shouldn't be that currency, for example stays with 1mb, BUT adoption/use stays at a perfect level that keeps bitcoin's price stable.
If we are thinking of an ever expanding market this might be silly, but if our argument is small blocks will create massive fees in which only a select sector of the financial world might participate, then I wonder if there is this possibility.
So the hypothetical is that for some magical reason we have a stable number of participants, how do we feel about the implications and economics of a small block size in regards to creating a "stable commodity"

If the highest profiting most powerful entity in the industry cannot stop bot pools from arising, especially in the more complex plo, how or why could we assume that bots aren't already everywhere? So I think it's somewhat wrong to suggest peoples would avoid this out of ignorance: 
It seems WAY more realistic to suggest that players will care more and more as time goes by about the profitability of their field in relation to things such as bots and collusion.
But this is not what I have suggested. I have suggested that the only true solution is to incentivize bots to act as nodes to hold up the private network. Economically it is impossible for a market of poker bots to refuse such incentive as long as it is above their profits for "defecting". Simply a generalization of the bitcoin.pdf and then specialized for the poker industry.
After that nothing changes and there can be no argument about what players will or will not play. There is no difference in this "future" world. Poker Stars can still be Poker Stars but now they can drop the costs of centralized server and security models. Since the public games set a standard of winrate, there is now the framework for a competitive industry.
New players can either join "sites' or simple enter the bot-fest public pool. Poker players would do the former, and gamblers probably mostly the later (remember these are new players archetypes).
The only true change from your protest is that there is now a competitive market place, because the barrier of entry to create a new site is minus the server costs, minus much of the security costs, and minus much or all of the regulatory compliance costs (etc.)
We have to be careful not to suggest that what cannot happen is exactly the same thing people would say could not happen before bitcoin.
(thx!)

[QUOTE=Craggoo;47340336]Who's going to pay the "poker specialists" checking for collusion? Who would pay the general customer support staff? Who would pay for additions to the site? Who would pay for server related costs? Who would pay for promotions? 
You obviously haven't thought anything through[/QUOTE]
On the one hand if you can some how secure/guarantee the profitability of the game collusion wouldn't be a problem. But as a decentralized project having the community incentivize players as collusion detectors is both practical and feasible. In fact, and especially in light of recent events, such a method is far more efficient both in cost and detection, ESPECIALLY if the community finally had access to all of the relevant data. There can even be automated algorithms to do this anonymously (without revealing players info/retaining privacy).
There is no customer support per se. It SOUNDS controversial but we are talking about a theoretically fault proof system. Now for example bitcoin has this, BUT bitcoin BANKS do NOT have this. So for poker, the dealing and buyins and gameplay etc. will be perfectly fault proof, but depending on how the overall economic system works there still might be poker sites that offer a product and therefore such support.
So imagine a decentralized dealing and cash in and cash out process that is fault proof, and then "new" poker stars and "new" full tilt "new" x or "new" y site, that offers a marketing model and tournament/cash table structure. Then there can clearly be bonuses as well (not to mention a decentralized community could offer such bonuses.
As for server costs, there are none because its P2P obviously.
Simply put the ultimate reward is taking the centralized inefficiencies, solving them, and keeping the costs saved in the economy of the game.

Yes I think I understand what you mean to say.  And there is a way for me to answer that wraps it together; not sure if I will be able to answer well.
There is the suggestion here I think that the great pyramids where necessarily built by iterations of, first small pyramids, and gradually larger, I think, since this would facilitate the ability to create perfectly secure pyramids (secure in this sense means so perfectly built they stand "forever").  I guess in some ways to we might find a corollary that in order to build a pyramid of x size (large), it must be built very very well or it wouldn't stand in the first place (where shoddily built smaller pyramids still might be completed (but not necessary stand for the test of time). 
John Nash starts his proposal out with the point that money is a technology that evolved to exist and to become better over time like the wheel etc.  There is then the suggestion that using science and extrapolating from the past we might project a future for money that is beyond a simple evolution based on competition of the fittest (ie accidental evolution). He talks extensively about the history of money so that "we" might do this, and then he goes on to project what would be IDEAL money.
One might argue Nash cannot reasonably claim to know what ideal money would be.  But he's more clever than that. He doesn't proposes a technology, or a parameter, or anything tangible etc.  He simple goes upon what the theoretical ideal for money would be, which is essentially a money's whats value does not degrade over time. If money goes up or down in value over time in terms of its purchasing power, there are reasons why each is not favourable for the purpose of money.
But money is also special, different than the invention of a car or something else.  It is a social tool for solving a problem, and namely the problem of the proper valuation of commodities. The real problem is that such valuation cannot be subjective, however, in a society that cannot properly valuate things (ie not a peaceful one) how can there be an objective view? 
Society is its own beast, regardless of what the individual wants or thinks.  The individual says "reason is x" but society wins if it says no its "y".  It's difficult to argue with society, but more importantly there is no value in it, society is an immovable force, but by its own successive iterations (proven failures and successes). 
Money's value in our society come from its ability to facilitate and optimize trade.  Optimized trade as you allude to creates the efficient markets that is able to solve otherwise unsolvable problems.  Commodity valuation is one.  But I also note that society will brute force solve poker, once the poker markets run efficiently (in this effect I show that poker has evolved as an unsolvable game that we "pay" players to solve by either winning or losing with their good or bad strategies).
I think your suggestion works, but not with money, and I think we are learning together, me and you, and as a society what money is and why it has this odd characteristic.
All in all the simple way to wrap this up is, one might have a far superior form of money, that has a gap in its implementation, such as "Dear United Nations, we need to work together and cooperate to make this money "super-bitcoin future" to work".  But I think the UN will not listen because its money that facilitates this kind of cooperation and we do not have the good enough type of money to facilitate that type of cooperation. 
If you follow though, I HAVE extended these thoughts, into and beyond that type of society, one that solves problems by purposeful cooperative means, I think its interesting, you might be interested I dunno.

Yes its definitely a large part of the reason I feel the way I do: 
Pokereum has some ideas.  I tried to reach out to the authors and developers and they did nothing but call me insane.  Shortly after I was contacted by another group and told other peoples had the same dealings and I was able to get more info than anyone.
V. Buterin took one look and said its game-able (ie not economically secure). 
Furthermore it only supports randomized seating which is a non-starter, I will tell you this right now.
But my article and a few others I wrote suggest there is the possibility to tweak the design that will create a fully functional p2p foundational layer of zoom poker, that creates and infrastructure in which ANYONE can create their own pokersite. I am quite confident this direction is the only and real solution which is why I think we might have enough headway in cryptography etc. to do an implementation that could rock the world.
All these projects seem to take the view they need to create poker site that is decentralized.  Its not what satoshi did, he didn't provide a bank, just the money.  We need to provide the chips and the cards and let the solutions for security beyond that arise from the free market competition that will ensue. 
Here is a pic for what I am thinking: 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:25:12
The above was a pm made public I guess so here is the reply:
 &gt;What dude? Bitcoin never was supposed to have the characterization of a payment P2P system? That is exactly what Bitcoin is supposed to be, did you read the white paper?
I don't care about age or education, but probability makes me categorize you when you open your thoughts with "dude". I read the white paper more times than you. Keeping, for example, a 1mb block size does not change bitcoin as a p2p payment system. It changes the thing you are inferring from the statements made on the paper: bitcoin should scale to a coffee money.


I agree. But you are chewing your own tail for food here. I think NOBODY should decide, and we should let the markets function as they are. YOU want a consensus that will have to be reached by the elite before the markets move on this.


No I am not a statist. But I am quite sure if you chat Gavin up on this subject you will find he is far more statist, by YOUR definition, than I am. I think YOU can't accept bitcoin is imperfect by design and should probably remain that way. I doubt this thread will be banned, and I would be surprised if it were, and in fact I'll personally pm theymos for you if it does get deleted and argue it be re-instated. You are probably welcome to post here but if you continue to cry about censorship repeatedly then you are by definition spamming and trolling. If you have something to add that is not on the mod's agenda I am confident they will allow it.


Yes then it is silly to come back to this thread to complain when you can make your own subreddit right? THAT is free market. Complaining bitcoin is centralized because of on section of one website is control by one group of mods is really just being ignorant right?


You have these things backwards. You want to impose your change on bitcoin, no blocksize limit, and THEN let markets decide. But I don't want you to impose your will on OUR currency. I want the markets to decided what they will now. And regardless of anything there is no centrally controlled economy for bitcoin. Capitalism means you create your own coin if you think it can be better. Changing bitcoin to suit the needs of the ignorant population is communism. This I am sure of.

This seems reasonable for me to request especially depending on how far out of context my proposal is taken.
I've read all of the above before making the post you quoted.
You or I have no insider knowledge on how well the industry combats bots.
We have evidence that the most powerful site with the most powerful security is failing at securing (from the botting perspective) one of the more complex games .
Information that is posted by other players gives speculation on how much the industry is combating bots. Yet you cannot even assume that the bots that were running will be easier, harder or not able to detect by the information they've gathered.
I've attacked the problem from the assumption that bots are prevalent and optimal, and also with the assumption that as time goes by bots will be more economically powerful and more optimal (therefore more prevalent). Solving this scenario necessarily addresses any unfavorable environment.
You gloss over why people will not want to run their bots on whichever private or public network if they disagree with any incentive proposed.
Perhaps I did gloss over, you must forgive me, there is a ton of literature here. Especially relevant is the pokererum whitepaper, but also a diagram of the public/private system neither of which I can seem to post the links to. But your question here doesn't quite make sense to me so I don't think you are understanding me.
Bots are going to try to play anywhere that is profitable. If a bot makes 5$/h doing A, and 4$/h doing B, the large majority are going to do A, that's basic economics. So there IS in fact an equilibrium here when it comes to incentivizing cooperation (in regards to using bot farms from public games as decentralized jurors/nodes for private games).
New sites that can arise now in competition with status quo can simply offer a better anti bot solution, OR a more profitable field, or both etc. Again I must point out the real problem is profitability, and very few players actually care about who they are playing in this regard. The biggest problem with bots is they kill the profitability of the field, secure the profitability and the bots problem effectively doesn't exist.
You didn't really bring much discussion with your posts by the way.
I'm sorry but you haven't understood 1% of what I am suggesting so it would take some time unfortunately. Perhaps others have thoughts. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:29:18
no i am saying what you are suggesting is an INFERENCE. Satoshi said X: A implies B
You are suggesting X implies Y.
Without arguing the point that Satoshi wanted bitcoin to be and remain a coffee buying system, I can point out with perfect logic that implying  "a p2p e cash dissolves the need for 3rd parties" means that Satoshi means for bitcoin to remain a coffee money is an INFERENCE.
And I don't think its a logical one.
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:42:33
We have also highlighted something else in that being in "Satoshi's" position it might be that the type of moneys the people would expect and ask for might not be optimal from Satoshi's stand point. This is what I wonder about the people that want bitcoin to scale to a coffee money level.  This might not be optimal for the world circumstances today, yet it might not have been possible to bootstrap bitcoin without the allure of this property. 
I think then it also stands to reason Satoshi consulted different people on this.  Seems like it would be whimsical and reckless not to.

We are actually extremely behind in this discussion, here is the leading paper (not by me): 


Pokererum basically proposes a zoom style seating arrangement that uses both stake and a proof of action/participation algorithm to secure the system. Then there is a randomly selected jury pool that verifies the gameplay. I think this would work and it effectively solves collusion but only with random seating.
I propose on top of this a tweak I think that wraps up the problem into something quite solvable. Basically public games (free for all zoom style bots) and private games that pay rake to the lower level public games for verification incentive).
Image: 
Bots cannot enter private games but would necessarily fill up the public tables (only) to the degree it is profitable for them to do so. Then there is a secure p2p network, incentivized by privately paid rake, that ANYONE can use to create their own "private" tables or "private" sites.
THIS is something bots cannot do, they cannot invite themselves to private games. But truly what you are effectively doing is breaking down completely the barrier to entry that is currently holding up the unfavorable monopolistic conditions we see today.
The kicker/killer here I believe both you will appreciate is I think that you can set the system up to pay the most to habitual LOSERS, and by paying them a sort of rakeback/stake in the network, they can either keep in to "mine"/verify games and make more "value", OR they can sell it to bot//node farms in exchange for money.

Thank you.  I read this a few times.  I'm not strong with the concept of marginal cost but its interesting to me.  For what I understand it brings a few questions to mind.  Is this comparable to bitcoin?  People's seem to often only see the difference since bitcoins supply is limited, but I wonder if it might effectively be the same thing in regard to what is "good money" or a useful commodity for the monetary systems we have (ie gold standard)?
I suspect in regard to marginal cost, that again predictability is at least a factor. And I do understand supply needn't be finite, although many peoples believe that is one quality of gold that makes it valuable (incorrectly I think).
I see two lines here.  A money can't be favorable that has a manipulated supply (I mean by 3rd parties that aren't trustworthy etc.).  But you also point out to a commodity type money that represents an underlying efficiency created and stored. Then the relationship between the two must be the useful metric.
Also I think I see fiat and paper money really messed up our understanding of money

Nice, I would only point out we couldn't have this convo if I hadn't started it in an aggravating style of writing. Eventually someone who can get through their own emotions could read the words.  Its interesting because in the bio he does mention something close to "rational thinking limits ones ability to understand the cosmos", but I think to give it proper context he means "rational", in that our definition of rational is not exactly correct. And so to make true academic and scientific progress, one must function or think beyond or out the box that we seem to define as 'rational'. 
And yes no doubt the field medal was not so appealing because he had to share it with 2 others (im vaguely recalling facts), but it would be quite more important if we didn't not apply his works correctly in that they were meant for something bigger in terms of our economic change.  I think people that might not understand true intelligence leads one to an altruistic behavior and function, might suggest that a genius (not me, him) functions in a self serving manner.  I don't think that is possible.
I suspect rather that 'illness' in the mental form is a very good disguise for someone that was not able to present such 'controversial' material to the public even a few years ago, for fear the public would basically turn it into a witch trial.  
Its not so simple to say the man was never ill, but its not so simple to suggest such intelligence can be labeled illness by people that clearly cannot understand the extent of such genius.  I simply point out that "satoshi" has great reason to hide in this current society, but its society itself that is 'ill' not the man that understand how to change it and the importance of it.
I'm reading now david bohms work, Einstein prodigy, to whom we have many of the same sentiments about, he was apparently 'easily fooled' and fell for a charlatan. But reading the (seeming) thesis of his works, they become clear nowadays for the average reader (to which he obviously knew they would).  Its just that in the 70s or 80's if you told the people we needed to think about how we are headed for imminent destruction they would tell you thats not important and has nothing to do with quantum physics or language or computers.

so for example szabo gives a solution for the kula ring 
it is an explanation that when an island in a change that wasn't previously participating in trade, all of a sudden completes the trade ring, there can arise 2 economic lines going both counter and clockwise. This in itself as ramification for our archeological and economic understanding of the past, but it can also but understood and applied for future technology (or bitcoin solution). 
If we take it to the next level, and imagine economy on a sphere, or rather different systems within such an economy, a completed kula ring might reside in the center and then facilitate an new type of exchange connecting all the current systems residing on the sphere. 
Clearly bitcoin solution and implementation completes a higher level kula ring. This is how szabo was able to recognize and develop smart contracts, which is really the bridging of all computer languages with law politics and economics.  To truly understand this you must study ancient law, ancient politics, and ancient economics to some extent. 
Wai dei's b-money because interesting in that regard, people seem to miss that it holds the key to some of the inner workings and understandings of the bitcoin solution, AND that it is written in the form of contracts. 
It seems to me that some certain person forseaw this coming technology and has been re writing every academic field contingent on it. I might be wrong in some form (or completely), but if I am correct than this person within about a years time, will be receiving every academic award we have since the completion of this higher level kula ring has essentially done just that. 
It has great, immediate, and direct impact on things such as einsteins work and our understandings of quantum physics as well, but its not immediately identifiable. Certainly tho wei dai has been thinking about the cosmological significance: 
And I have seen and interview (video not text because their is a text discussion that is more satirical), where nash says he thinks he has a solution to einstein's works that doesn't involve the C. constant.

Nash proposed ideal money is based on an industrial consumption price index (ICPI), a carefully crafted basket of commodity prices.  Nick Szabo extensively defines and shines light on how commodity prices fluctuate in response to real life facts, even so far as running and examining simulations for them.  
The conjecture is that Satoshi based bitcoin's printing schedule of geometrically decreasing 50% every four years as a perfect reflection of an ICPI.
Thus bitcoin is in fact "Ideal Money".
If its not, maybe we should change it to reflect as such ;)

I think I'm suggesting that in 1955 nash wrote a letter to the nsa boasting that he could not lose the encryption race (he told them that the encryptor always can beat the encryptor, while simultaneously asking if they knew this AND suggested to them that they should try to figure out what their enemy knows).
He proved that there is a perfect strategy for all non cooperative games (that is applicable to real life 'conflicts')
He wrote a paper on the value that money brings to a society in trade (bitcoin is the next evolution of the this solution btw).
he was running around saying he was going to be the man that freed us from colluding governments.
in a week he went 'crazy and was put in an asylum twice. 
when he left he fled to europe where he admits in recent interview he came up with the idea for 'ideal money' because he tried to ditch his usd for a stronger currency. (he says he was brought back by the navy in chains.
he spent his academic carreer as the phantom of fine hall writting on chalkboards late at night (why not use a computer huh?)
he has been traveling the world giving lectures country to country on a new kind of money and what governments should do in response to it.

Here are some facts.  When Nash was a kid, he proved the value of money in trade, showed that all non-cooperative finite games have a solution (ie war), and he wrote to the NSA with a conjecture that the encryption is king.  Then he fled to Europe because of his concept of "ideal money" money and tried to exchange his usd for the swiss franc.
"The special commodity or medium that we call money has a long and interesting history.

I think in the near future you'll look back on my words and realize they were absolutely clear.  But time will tell.  Understand the difficulty in one part of my reasoning/explanation:
The intelligent persons or person (likely multiple) created satoshi nakamoto in a way that it is a mathematically untraceable image. Its one thing to be anonymous, society can understand that, but these men are among the smartest minds in our world, they can take it one step further: a ghost image of a person everyone is looking for, and plausible deniability for anyone involved.
Questions, papers, news, and fighting over who satoshi is and whether they are szabo is not real.  Its part of the distraction. 
You want to tell me to change my tone, but i've been trying to explain it for months, and you can't get anywhere because the internet is full of trolls and the bitcoin community is rigged.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:39:19
I more think that "satoshi" was a pdf created with complete plausible dependability for those that inspired it.  We might not understand how to bring that about, we aren't as smart as these men I would assume.  
I think you read ideal money too fast, and remember that there are 10+ versions of it, each giving different references and examples.  10 years ago it would have no relevance today, but he is spelling out the end of keynsian economics which is government ability to control and print fiat money...that would never seem relevant 10+ years ago.
He alludes to things like the gordian knot which is sometimes thought of as a ancient type of cipher.  Or the ancient Islamic money which many people don't know that it is usury free (much like bitcoin is to become). He suggests in the future their might be a NEW kind of money, and this is the kind of thing that transforms a non cooperative zero sum game into a cooperative one where everyone can gain.  He talk about how such an idea can eventually lead to ideal money which is a money that actually represents correctly the value it is supposed to.
He suggests with a new money we can begin to educate ourselves and ask ourselves which money we want to support and invest in. 10 years ago this might not make sense, but today its something all of us digital money people are now beginning to do. He equates keynesian economics to old school borgeios thinking.  
He did a long time ago get committed for thinking that communists and anti communists were on the same side, but today we kind of realize that is true, because the global elite that run the world do not always think in terms of nationism.  They say he became obsessed with the middle east conflict, but we might now understand that islam and western world conflict is not separate from their economic beliefs in money.  You can't just say this stuff in society though, although its getting to be less taboo.
I think rather than assume he was in fact crazy and his new economic writings to which hes been traveling the world giving lectures on are just gibberish, we might want to lighten our focus on 'bitgold' and pay attention to the genius who previous mathematical discoveries have already become the foundation our economic.  Although clearly in a perverted fashion.
I think if you read more slowly, you'll find each sentence spells something amazing, for instance "money has a long and interesting history", and we might find that history on Szabo's webpage.
Very few people have a wholistic view in our society, our current method is to specialize, it's quite coincidence to have satoshi, nash, dai, and szabo all on the same page. I'll write something about the ktulu ring szabo pointed to next, and it might help you decide if i am suggesting something worthwhile with proof, or am just lost.

No that stream metaphor is from Bohm, einstein's student, perfectly describes the bitcoin protocol (or the foundation it lays as the uncorruptable public ledger that you must take out the whole to corrupt the ledger). SEEMINGLY "someone" took the metaphor, and turned it into a tangible solution.  We do know that Bohm And Einstein are from Princeton university. We do know someone approached Einstein with some ideas and Einstein told them to read some certain physics books (and this person was from princeton).  And we do have an interesting paper, that didn't make sense a few years ago but might make sense now 
We do know a master of cryptography: 
We DO know someone that has spent their career on solutions to cooperative games...
We DO know someone that has great interest in hiding their realizations from the government and the peoples...

What does this seem like to you: 
One might here consider the image of a turbulent mass of
vortices in a stream. The structure and distribution of vortices,
which constitute a sort of content of the description of the
movement, are not separate from the formative activity of the
flowing stream, which creates, maintains, and ultimately dissolves
the totality of vortex structures. So to try to eliminate the
vortices without changing the formative activity of the stream
would evidently be absurd

I read it all for you.  Somethings cannot be understood in "parts" and so if you want to secretly implement something before society or 'government' picks up on it, then you can break it into parts.  Once the parts are laid, you can slowly encourage people to put them together, and understand the whole.

     Signs of the Times (Among National Currency Authorities)
    Comparatively very recently a few countries in South America and
Central America have adopted schemes that put them in positions
analogous to those of Luxembourg and Liechtenstein with regard to the
provisions for their domestic currency. Here Argentina and El Salvador
can be mentioned. They are adopting (at least temporarily) expedients
that put the value of their domestic money on a fixed relation to the
U. S. dollar. And of course Panama has had such a situation for a long
time previously.
    This is not "ideal money" because the U. S. dollar is not an ideal 
standard for money value. But the countries adopting such expedients
thus offer their citizens, at least for as long as they manage to or
choose to continue it, a deliverance from a typical past tradition 
of national currencies of even less stable value than that of the 
(historically observed) U. S. dollar.
    But if, for example, all of the countries of the world would base
the value for their national currencies on the value of the british
currency then this situation would appear singular and unstable, while
it was not so singular for a lot of countries to base their currency
value on gold.
    So the United Nations building can be in New York and the IMF and
the IBRD institutions in Washington, DC, USA, but these historical
facts do not make the U. S. dollar a good standard of value which the
managers of currency systems in other countries could justifiably
exploit to permanently fix the relative values of their national
    The metric system does not work because french chefs de cuisine
are constantly cooking up new and delicious culinary creations which
the rest of the world then follows imitatively. Rather, it works 
because it is something invented on a scientific basis and in fact, 
after Waterloo, it was not first accepted in France but rather in 
The Netherlands.
  
                 Price Indexes in General
     Various states calculate some sort of a CPI or measure of the
"cost of living" for inhabitants of their territory. It is possible
that "globalization" and in general trends leading to more non-local
sources for basic needs like food and clothing will have the effect 
of making CPI indices calculated in different states tend to become
concordant. Of course the effects of taxes can be very complicating
in relation to comparisons of distinct national CPI indices.
    It seems possible and not unlikely, however, that if two states
evolve towards having currencies or more stable value as measured
locally by national CPI indices that then also these distinct
currencies would tend to evolve towards more stable comparative
relations of value.
    **Then the limiting or "asymptotic" result of such an evolutionary
trend would be in effect "ideal money" but this as a result achieved
without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for
the standard of value.**
                 Tax Revenues Complications
    It is very well known among economists who study "macroeconomics"
(or the large scale picture of a national economy) that inflation, of
itself, produces the effect of varieties of taxation.
    On the one hand owners of state obligation securities (bonds, 
notes, etc.) find that the value of their holdings are reduced as the 
"true" value of a unit of the domestic money is reduced by inflation. 
So they are as if taxed on their holdings. And on the other hand, 
if the state has established a form of "capital gains tax" then 
the effect of inflation is to add an amount to whatever would be
 calculated as the "capital gain" on property held for a time and 
then sold. A nominal gain can even be created by inflation where 
a "true value" measure would have fairly determined a loss.
    Then these considerations make clear, for example, that if, say,
the state finances of Xland operated stably with a capital gains tax
and with stable "targeted inflation" of 2.5 % annually than that there
would be a loss of state revenues if the inflation rate were reduced
to zero. That is, there would be a loss that could be expected in the 
area of the capital gains tax revenues.
    So we can see that for the government of a state, acting on its own
 independently of other states, to rationally contemplate the evolution 
of the inflation rate for its currency towards zero there are clearly some 
very relevant considerations relating to tax revenue expectations.
                     Psychological Considerations
    A truly "Machiavellian" regime can rationally scheme to make the
citizenry of the state FEEL well served (at least for a relatively
short time period) independently of whatever might be most truly best
for them (as seen from an "Olympian" viewpoint). Here it can be noted
that if there is gradual inflation then there should tend to be more
and more "millionaires" as a fraction of the population. If instead 
there were fewer and fewer of these then that might conceivably impact
negatively on the psychology of the citizenry. 
    It is also notable that there has been an overall sense of always 
increasing human per capita wealth, globally, as technological advances 
continue to modify the nature of the global economy. But consider the
 effect of measuring wealth purely in terms of square miles owned per 
capita of the earth's land surface. If each Hopi tribesman owns x by 
this measure and each Navaho tribesman owns y by the measure then,
 with global population steadily increasing, should they feel happy or sad?
    Perhaps humanity will REALLY arrive at increased wealth if we can 
successfully colonize lands beyond Terra, like the surfaces of Mars,
the Moon, and some asteroids. (But of course we could not illogically
claim ALREADY to own the whole Solar System at least, so it is clear
that psychological alternatives enter here also with regard to the
issue of the "true" evaluation of per capita wealth.)
    Possibly the full psychological effect of human "ownership" of the
surface of Mars would not be realized until that area had been divided
into plots regarded as the private property of specific corporate or
personal owners!

together, and keep in mind while reading, hes fucking with us...
and keep in mind how much some people naturally hate bitcoin 
and people who talk about money (see bolded for bitcoins
 monetary supply and considerations): 
 
 
                   Asymptotically Ideal Money
 
     After writing and speaking on a concept of "Ideal Money" which 
was itself arrived at after many years of meditation I now have also 
thought of a parallel concept which relates to political realities, psychology
influencing the actions of politicians and voters or citizens, and which 
provides a concept of what may actually transpire in the evolution of
 customs and culture (as it were) relating to money.
    The ultimately launched concept of "Ideal Money" became possible
 when I conceived of a practical basis for a standardization of the comparison 
of the value of the currency with an appropriate standard or ideal. And the key 
to that was the idea of an ICPI or (international) "Industrial Consumption Price 
Index". (That is thus like the U.S. CPI which controls Social Security payouts
 but is adapted to relate to industrial producers rather than to individuals
 and it is envisioned as being essentially dependent, by choice of its
 definition, on costs that are very global in nature, like, for example, 
the cost of oil from OPEC and other producers or the cost of platinum,
 tungsten, or nickel.)
    ** But one cannot logically feel confident of the adoption internationally of 
an ideal system of currency or currencies in an achievement analogous 
to the achievement of the metric system or of "the euro".**
 **Such a result would necessarily have a political content since it is the 
states that control and supply the various currencies that are in use at 
the present time. And projects requiring political support may be difficult 
to achieve or comparatively easy to achieve depending on elements of
 "political reality" which may differ considerably from the actual merits or 
lack of merits of the projects (as evaluated from, say, a scientific or economic or 
medical viewpoint).**
   **So it occurs to me to think that that which is not achieved by 
a grand action of establishment by "fiat" may alternatively tend to 
come into existence as a consequence of a process of evolution. And 
of course, after a certain degree of progress by "evolution" the 
rest of the progress could possibly be realized by a convention or 
a process of "fiat".**
 
                Currencies of Improving Quality
 
    From the viewpoint of parties domiciled outside of the territory 
of where a specific currency (such as, e.g. the currency of Brazil) is
established the "quality" of that currency is evaluated according to
 the reasonable appraisals of the probabilities of loss in value of 
the unit of that currency, particularly in comparison with other
 currencies and also in comparison with alternatives available for 
use for "storage of value", like gold or commodities in general. 
    The more that the probabilities of loss seem to be large the more
that currency will be evaluated as of "low quality".
    On the other hand, "Keynesian" central bankers or associated and
advising economists, WITHIN the state responsible for the currency 
in question (such as, e.g. Brazil), may be arguing that they should
have and use methods of operation that will tend to act in varying
degrees at various times to increase the supply of the currency and
thus cause, ultimately, declines in its value. They may argue that
 these actions, in which they have some discretionary options, are
 beneficial for the general welfare within the territory of the state
 (e.g., Brazil).
    Whether or not the options exploited by "Keynesian" central
 bankers and advisors are beneficial to the general welfare in the 
corresponding territories (e.g., Brazil) it is very clear, game theoretically, 
that they give those who can act on these options ADDITIONAL
 STRATEGIES that they otherwise would not be likely to have available. 
So it is also plausible that psychologically the having of these options 
would seem to be very desirable in contrast to their renunciation.
    So I want to suggest now the possibility that, within the context
of varieties of currencies which are of the type typically found 
nowadays and since the time of the influence of "the Keynesians" 
(and after the time of the formerly used "gold standard" or other
 forms of currency linked to a value standard), there is some real
 possibility that the typical "rate of depreciation" of currencies may 
tend to decrease. Thus there may evolve more disillusionment with the 
"Keynesian" methods that tend to cause to exist a continual (sometimes 
intermittent) deterioration in the internationally observable value 
of a specific national currency. (This would apply to "the euro" also,
 as if that were effectively the currency of an "United States of Europe".)
    The actors on the stage of the drama formed by the actions that
determine the trends in the value of a national currency are themselves
players in a game and they can be rationally viewed as such. The theme
of "rational expectations" naturally enters. Those who ARE NOT in
control but who ARE naturally concerned with the expectations for the
value trend of a national currency cannot be wisely assumed to be
entirely naive and unable to form "rational expectations" regarding
the currency. So the (possibly) "Keynesian" players in this game have
natural opponents (or co-players, beyond zero-sum perspectives) who
are interested in not being themselves "outsmarted" by those who
control the options that determine, say, the quantity supplied of
the national currency.
 
        Signs of Attitudes (Among Central Banking Authorities)
    On the web page of the Swedish State Bank there appears a sort 
Of speedometer measuring the rate of inflation. The fact that this 
appears indicates several things about the psychology of the responsible
 authorities there. One of these is that they have the concept that 
the government can choose policies to control the rate indicated and 
that varying consequent results (as regards the value 
of that rate of depreciation (of the value of the currency)) may
 be achieved as a result of various conceivable choices of policy.
 (In the case of a poorer nation it might seem more likely that the
 authorities would not usually seem to have any ability to control 
the rate of inflation, as measured modulo the domestic currency of
 that poorer nation.)
    **Now the possible area for evolution is that if, say, an inflation
rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate
in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn't a rate
between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable? (The rate measured by
the swedish speedometer is determined in relation to a domestic CPI
calculated for Sweden.)**

He does mention in his bio, that mental illness can be  an escape (not that I agree I am 'ill' but might come across as such so its maybe debatable), but he is not clear about what such an escape is from.  One must wonder how long ago a person like him could realize that game theory and computers could be used to reach an equilibrium in which no attack could gain enough power to corrupt it. (I might argue it was right around the time he was committed and probably never slept for a very long time after such a realization). 
I think we are ALL special sir, and that we don't as a society quite understand that or realize it. As some of this technological change reaches the masses, our conscious perception of the world will change with it, along with a realization the technology is really always just an extension of our group consciousness. 
In that I think some of mine and other peoples 'confusing' presentations might be re read to be perfectly understandable.  And so its really a matter of time and acceptance.  
I would love to connect with people that are real and sincere in this regard.  But they are very hard to find, as we know the extension of our consciousness today (ie the internet and community forums) are very fragmented and seemingly quite individualistic in their root nature.

I'm sorry the "argument" was started from that fashion.  The real argument goes as follows: Nash has been touring the world for the last 20 years talking country to country about a new kind of money technology that is going to revolutionize the money printing keynesian beliefs the citizens have and eventually create a standard monetary unit (not a single currency) perfectly spelling out the advent of bitcoin to a civilization that could not understand his words. There are multiple versions because he adopted each one to the culture in which he was speaking to.
He has every single capability that is needed to create bitcoin or to be satoshi, or to inspire or teach satoshi or to solve the byzantine generals problem.  He already revolutionized our economy 50+ years ago and it took us 40 years to realize it. shortly after he did that with among many papers one defining the value of money to our society, he was put in an asyslum for claiming he was going to free the people from the colluding governments.
Right around the time he sent a broken up version/plan of bitcoin to the government through multiple channels:
Upon his release he fled to Europe and came up with the concept of ideal money. 
Ideal money is a cryptic lecture that each line basically perfectly corresponds to Nick Szabo's blog starting with the opening line "money has a long and intersting history" which couples perfectly with "Shelling out: the origin of money", in which szabo talks about the nash equilibrium (doesn't site nash) and proposes a crucial solution to the entire bitcoin project: the kula ring.
Szabo has solved an proposed an amount of solutions that already put him among the greats. And one can see he went to great lengths to become a lawyer to make sure the bitcoin had the correct "oversight" it needed.
Don't think 50 year old hacker...think Benjamin Franklin and a lifetime of knowledge as an extension of an incredible break through. 
I don't know who szabo is, but Nash fits every single marker in this puzzle, and none of you can produce a person or evidence otherwise, other than szabo that seems to only have bread crumbs of an existence irl ...
Who is the conspiracy theorist and why aren't we talking about "ideal money"?
"What is most interesting of all is Szabo formalized adam smith recently:  This formalizes Adam Smith's observations: the division of labor (and thus value of an economy) increases with the extent of the market, and the extent of the market is heavily influenced by transportation costs (as he extensively discussed in his Wealth of Nations)."
Which is the most controversial/unexplainable scene in the hollywood movie on nash about the nash equilibrium (or not) and whether or not smith needs revision:

what is strange is at the exact same time John Nash was explaining exactly how we can arrive at such an implementation, he called the mechanism for implementation "asymptotically Ideal money" in his lectures "ideal money"
He also uses the world "envisioned" in the lecture about Ideal Money:
 The ultimately launched concept of "Ideal Money" became possible when I conceived of a practical basis for a standardization of the comparison of the value of the currency with an appropriate standard or ideal. And the key to that was the idea of an ICPI or (international) "Industrial Consumption Price Index". (That is thus like the U.S. CPI which controls Social Security payouts but is adapted to relate to industrial producers rather than to individuals and it is **envisioned** as being essentially dependent, by choice of its definition, on costs that are very global in nature, like, for example, the cost of oil from OPEC and other producers or the cost of platinum, tungsten, or nickel.)

@_date: 2014-08-31 11:12:50
Right, now here's where the significance of the conjecture comes in. A coin that tracks gold is completely different than the concept of bitcoin in relation to "ideal money".  If true, the formula behind bitcoin is a basket of ALL the significant commodities adjusted for any relevant logical reasoning (intensively provided by "Szabo"). Man has competed through its market inventions through its entire history and that history creates a perfect feedback loop for the type of commodities that create more ideal circumstances for better currencies.  By harnessing that information, one could "predict" (or design) what the mining rate of a commodity would be that would give it the quality of being the ideal currency.
The physical tangible aspects of commodities such as gold or silver are not the reasons they are superior for using as currency but rather their value as a currency comes from the formula that produces it. 
The simple genius revelation that we all seem to miss is that it's not about linking an existing currency to an ideal price, but rather the ideal commodity basket births the ideal currency. Furthermore this in fact makes it a very valuable commodity.
Its a formula that brings about super currency.  Even a currency pegged to gold is not of the quality of bitcoin.  The hidden factor is that the printing schedule is based on the formula extrapolated from the ICPI.
The new paradigm is that there is no longer a need for the separation of a commodity from a currency in the traditional way we have viewed it.

It might be an oversimplification but the idea is the money that loses its value over time has has incentive to circulate where as money that has stable value such as gold is more incentive to hold. Keep in mind this is initially for bitcoin, especially since now most of the coins are already circulated.

I think then that quantum computing "formalized" languages need the possibility of a probability of say 2. I have no one or no material to look into that though except obscure stuff (that does seem to support such a notion).
Shinichi Mochizuki's work becomes extremely relevent as generalized extension of elliptical curve theory. I don't think I could get many peoples to agree with me though.

No but i recognize his face and have likely come across him in my studies briefly.  I noticed he is not unconnected with bohm: In 1982 New Science Library published his anthology The Holographic Paradigm and other Paradoxes[6] a collection of essays and interviews, including one by David Bohm. The essays, including one of his own, looked at how holography and the holographic paradigm relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism and science.
Although I don't know enough to suggest anything about their connection, its just interesting its pointed out so quickly on his essay.  My experience is more with jiddu krishnamurti, through bruce lees writings, as bohm's works are mostly extrapolations of talks through krishnamurti. 
they did many such talks knowing they future of man would be able to see them.
I am however quite interested in many things that Wilber's wiki alludes to such as re interpreting the vedantic texts etc. all of which i have been studying as well, but studying for my has no direction and is very 'random' in the way we view education. So sometimes I go deep into one subject and sometimes I just see how far I can connect surface understandings.  Sometimes I study stuff I can't understand.
Obviously it produces understandings and explanations that seem quite broken and half hazard to those that learn 'normally', but I think I could connect and understand someone like wilber in a way that most 'educated' peoples cannot.
Satoshi's bitcoin for example, is really a tangible and computational solution to bohm's work quoted here: 
One might here consider the image of a turbulent mass of
vortices in a stream. The structure and distribution of vortices,
which constitute a sort of content of the description of the
movement, are not separate from the formative activity of the
flowing stream, which creates, maintains, and ultimately dissolves
the totality of vortex structures. So to try to eliminate the
vortices without changing the formative activity of the stream
would evidently be absurd
We can understand this is the process by which the ledger is not corruptible because you must effect the entire p2p network.  In a piece out of context it might seem like a coincidence, but if you read the entire works, it becomes clear there is a connection between einstein bohm, and whomever was the inspiration behind the bitcoin solution. 
Every bio of nash suggest he went to einstein with some ideas on physics and einstein snuffed nash and told him to read some physics books.  Its too hard for me to believe that einstein could "miss" nash's intelligence, AND that nash didn't actually read the recommended books and find them extremely pertinent and useful. 
Sorry I don't know if its better for me to 'make' the connections just to quote the facts and cite them. Doesn't matter if I am correct it all seems quite interesting regardless.

Szabo might be Szabo but what we know for sure is Nash perfectly described bitcoin in his lecture Ideal Money, and toured the world explaining it to a civilization that could not understand him.
Ideal Money is a very short outline of the entire project, and Nick Szabo's blog extensively explains it as if "ideal money" is the chapter titles for each section of the book.
Not sure the relation, but I think what is happening is none of the people that know Szabo's works ALSO know understand nash's "ideal money"
We might assume this is correct and obvious until Szabo and others start to discuss the genius of Ideal Money showing that it is not in fact written by him, since it is an amazing lecture perfectly predicting our currency environment.  Maybe there is another keynsian money printing revolution happening?:

"too good" is very well defined in the lecture series rather being the like the stable usefulness of gold.  And so "exploited" would seem  to mean ultimately "hoarded".

No.  The problem with Keynes as hayek stated was that he didn't have international considerations in his economic ideals.  The study/talk you quote is guilty of exactly that.   It's not science to just quote a paper.  What if I told you that high transaction costs were not the downfall of the soviet union but rather the downfall was the reason transaction costs increased?
Keeping transaction costs down does not attend the problems of our global financial system and their are many such currencies that will always have the potential to be far cheaper in this sense.

One of us has read the associated literature on the macro-economic implications of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:11:25
Can't really be summarized.  He is asked about bitcoin, and basically he loses his "timing" and starts to ramble about the relationship of gold and silver and how they have replaced each other as currencies and standards over time.
The discussion is about how "good" money and "bad" money work in relation to each other.  Over our history many types of "coins" have been faked or degraded over time and rulers have been mystified that peoples will only circulate bad money.
This is relevant to bitcoin, because the monetary supply creates this phenomenon that is relevant to "gresham's law".
Its very interesting however its also difficult to understand for most, since we generally tend to avoid such discussions about "money".

To attempt to solve is entirely in a different direction than to understand and to observe with choiceless awareness.

I don't think i mentioned Nash here.  Satoshi probably has a lot more wealth than just bitcoin right?
The point was that his ability to have that wealth is quite related to the solution he proposed.  The project was set in a way that he was obviously going to be a main benefactor because he was in early on the mining process. 
If he can't spend his coins that might be an issue, but I think I would like to have that problem rather than not. 
Surely he has other significant investments.
Thx for the grammar note, I originally glossed over your response and thought you didn't read anything, but today I realize that you certainly did.  I fixed it to my satisfaction and appreciate it. 
The point about modularity is that there is a metaphorical comparison to be made that is 1) not intuitive 2) related to natural evolution.  
The pyramids I hear from a friend we know exactly how they were built, then I am linked documentaries of pseudo science type that show clearly that we do not have this understanding.  
If what you suggest is new I would definitely traverse any material you send, but my understanding is we barely have basic knowledge of this. 
But the followers of theWealthofChips, if there are any, understand that I suggest that the pyramids evolved through naturally evolution in such a way that even the builders did not understand the how and the why to what they are doing.
It might sound ludicrous to you but my suggestion is more that we would not be the civilization we are today if they did not exist for so long.  So rather than how or why, its a realization that the ability to ask the question is but a symptom of the existence of the pyramids rather than intelligent inquiry.
The other point that I tried to make is that in going about conceiving useful inventions it might be that altruistic inventions will likely "suck" where as the capitalistic ones in which the creator benefits are probably superior.
About the bold, I dunno, I think that most people only read like that and also there is irony with the content...so I think I leave it in.
thx for your time, I missed the sincerity the first time, even if we disagree (and that you are possibly a little cynical, wry) etc.

Szabo says Oil prices usually move in tandem reversely correlated to inflation expectation.  Nash says a universal currency with a stable monetary supply would end inflation expectation. 
THIS IS OUR REALITY! 
Both seemed to recognize that once oil popped, markets would panic towards what they historically know as safety: USD/GOLD/US bonds.
And so while all of the sound invesments in the world such as metals, commodities, and bitcoin have tanked...
The entire world seems to be holding up the usd/gold in relation to everything else....
We should expect the USD to slide in relation to gold, and bitcoin to begin a massive upward campaign as markets lose their minds to such changes in price...
How quickly until major players lose confidence in the US economy?

Szabo gives the reasons why we either might have used a single currency standard or multiple currencies in the past. He shows why past economists missed this or got it wrong (or right).
Then he builds a mechanism to handle multiple currencies, which resides on top of a decentralized trustworthy smart contract network which he also designed and presents (ethereum for example), which resides on top of a trustworthy accounting system (bitcoin for example).
Gives the design for the market translator. Breaks his solution up into parts and presents it as a blog.  
Seems he did this 10-20 years ago.

Its because news and people do not discuss what is going on, but only repeat the narrative of what is going on, such as "Whoa, price is dropping" or "Bitcoin might be bad now".
The price is not always a reflection of peoples change in bitcoin preference but also has to do in relation to the economy which is changes rapidly. 
Now the answer to your question:
Everyone is afraid to analyze bitcoin in relation to the economy because they do not understand its implications.   Furthermore and strangely enough the implications are well described in the lecture "ideal money"

In regards to point 2 I think you have walked yourself into a circle Mr. Micon. Firstly in effect a poker player does actually pay rake to fund marketing campaigns, the difference here is there is a mutually beneficial initial investment being offered.  Like explained in Ideal Money/Ideal Poker, it is the creation of a unifying currency that allows a net gain between both "parties" net previously achievable.
The "crowdsale" is really just a new type of gambling game for the poker player:  If I invest 2 btc's now might I get a return on my investment in the future?  It is a new question the poker player has begun to ask oneself.  And as a crypto poker site owner I am sure you are quite happy to celebrate in another bitcoin poker site's (such as bitnplay) marketing success. Again we point to net cooperative gain because of the advent of new linking currency networks. 
The gamble of course is all about the sites' future success. 2 btcs today is worth about 532 and falling. On a site that is successful in the future 532 is an amazingly +ev investment.  As a poker loss it seems like a relatively small one for anyone that spends any significant amount of time online.  There might even be something to be made in the shorterm off of btc's price fluctuations.
The brilliance or the revolutionary change is the players can now legitimately hold title shares in a poker site without any more difficultly than adding funds to a poker site.
Now I have been writing about the NEXT evolution of poker beyond simple centralized bitcoin or crypto currency models for around a year now. Micon you have paved the way and given the "proof of work"  that has earned swc a solid/stable rep vs naysayer crowds, but now you face the next evolution.  The only arguments are whether this team is "moral" and has the intelligence/capacity to succeed, and to me this is clear since they are clearly the leaders in the industry today in terms of innovation and marketing.  That is how quick things change. It makes me want to gamble on this team.
Everyone here has an opinion but we will clearly see only the bitnplay team has spent extensive time thinking about all aspects of these concepts, as well as consulted throughout the merging industries about them. And now we have a brilliant business model merged into a self perpetuating marketing campaign. 
Players will now want to know when is swc going to honor a select amount of rake free accounts?  And what will be the price difference between the offers, and what will the ev of each be?

This is not the destructive type of central planning that Hayek refers to.  Hayek refers to the arbitrary and continual attempt to optimize something that cannot be optimized.  1mb, 2mb, 8mb, etc does not matter and is not central planning, centrally planning is to continually attempt to adjust or target.  To leave the block size alone is not central planning by the actual intended definition. 


This plan creates other centralization problems that are potentially fatal, which is exactly why we are witnessing a dilemma.  otherwise I would agree with you.
Now you know why the debate exists.  I dare say, you haven't read Hayek, which is where the argument against central planning comes from in this regard.

If that is true, he is using fodder as his argument.  Decentralization and the dangers of central planning are very well explained by Hayek, which Szabo has recommended as a read for anyone who wants to understand the bitcoin movement.  He is twisting the definition of a VERY important phrase in economics.  He is putting a political spin on a very well defined phrase (by Hayek).
Again, it is clear.  You haven't read the literature that you are unknowingly referring to.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:52:34


I think you meant "he", but nonetheless I am quite confident WE have fallen in that trap, in regard to the true origin of bitcoin.  If I remember correctly Szabo work on digi cash with Chaum or something.  I dunno, my suspicion is that Chaum consulted Nash (or vice versa), and no one wants to bring up either.  But I don't know if the true history matches that speculation.

I appreciate that you seem clearly sincere and "human".  But do consider the possibility that this is not intuitive.  That gresham's law is not intuitive. And that the average person will want a "money" that is bad for the society as a whole because of ignorance to this.  
Then we might see the possibility that satoshi didn't create this debate for no reason. You don't let the peoples decide this.  You give them a limit and tell them "no problem, we can change it, you just all have to agree".
You can change the framework for the American government system too, but you need a consensus you will never get.  This is how you protect the people from themselves.  Nobody here understands money that is the NATURE of it!  Money solves the problem that not enough people understand the complexity of the market system, the masses naturally do not understand.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:58:01

"common knowledge" is ignoring market theory.  The markets know better than common knowledge. If the blocksize happen to never change then the markets already know this. To talk about what the reddit community believes as truth is to ignore market theory.
Satoshi gave an example of change, and that is all you have to allude to because he never explicitly said the plan is to change the implied nature of bitcoin.  If he did you would have quoted it.  
Also just so we are clear there is nothing in the bitcoin.pdf to this regard either. Again otherwise you would have quoted where he suggest bitcoin's sole intended purpose is as a coffee money.  He never said anything of the sort.
@_date: 2016-03-26 05:40:18

@_date: 2016-03-03 22:40:32
Thats fine, but the community is laden with accounts that are claiming Satoshi explicitly wanted to scale bitcoin to a coffee money, which is so far off and so agenda driven its a lie.  You agree, he never said that, there is not proof, but conjecture that the proof may exist.

If Szabo, Adam Smith, J. Nash, Hayek, etc have taught us anything its that such observations are interesting.  It might be a sign, yet it might be the conditions needed to finally break through/off.

Gold is special as an inflation hedge.  It's demand for this is very related to its suitability as a hedge.  So if the supply wasn't so predictable and incorruptable it won't play the role it has.  That makes comparable to bitcoin.

perhaps he sees something you don't, like he did before when he redefined our understanding of economics in a flash of insight 70 years ago with he was in his 20's.
This is also when he came up with the concept of Ideal Money.  With 50+ years to refine his knowledge and concept, can you really claim to be sincere in ignoring it?
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:16:25
The dialogue is here: 
Which shows that Satoshi did say that we could scale bitcoin, and he gives an example.  
And yes the 1mb limit was expressed as being implemented to negate the possibility of ddos attacks. But you miss something obvious.  I have shown in the above that multiple people immediately pointed out how difficult it would be to change that (quotes in the link above), and that as time goes by it would obviously create this debate/dilemma.  People begged Satoshi not to do it, and he ignored them. That's fact.
There is nothing stating Satoshi's intentions to scale. Anything beyond this is speculation, and twisting fact for agenda.  So we are back at truth and reality.  Satoshi knew this would happen and he chose not to participate nor publicly explicitly suggest that the block size should be scaled.
MY BELIEF: is that to a large extent he hoped the peoples could not overthrow the consensus to change the IMPLIED nature of bitcoin.  "Implied" meaning bitcoin as a settlement, not as a coffee.  Reality supports this (ie so far consensus for significant change has been impossible).
Notice Nick Szabo called Hearn and Gavin's proposals an attack.

Szabo gave these sentiments as well.  Talking about how software is the best tool we have to change the world.  However.  I see something else.  I see some great men changed the world with words and a pen. 
I think in the future we will approach Nash's essays and realize what they REALLY are about.  I think we are not ready and he explained how and why we are not ready, but that as our money systems start to tend towards Ideal we will begin to care and ask the philosophical question "What is ideal money, how can it be brought about, what are the effects of ideal currency systems on our society?"
Don't we care about this?  This is what Nash explained in very great detail.
But don't forget and in complete contrast to your point, Nash made a few mathematical discoveries in regard to money and solutions to non-cooperative games a very long time ago...
It is well known these papers changed nearly every field of science dramatically.
This man has already massively changed the world, but it took nearly 40 years before we realized it, admitted it, and credited him for it...
I think its likely we repeated this mistake.

I think in this sense merchants and citizens are simply the customers of the currency suppliers.
Giving discounts highlights the issues a little I think.  
Merchants were all in with bitcoin at the very first, as if as people they thought it was a great idea.  But economically we might say the intelligent markets decided there was no value in doing so.  
I don't have the answer but I think its interesting to observe this phenomenon that there is either demand to hoard bitcoin or demand to spend but seemingly can't be both.
I don't know if i said that well.

You seemingly unknowingly gave circular logic here.  You basically said bitcoin can't become a digital gold because it must be a digital money.  The quality of a commodity that becomes a "gold" is not the quality of a coffee money. Gold itself is not a coffee money.  
Adoption then, and especially, does not happen because of a coffee money quality, it happens because the "honesty" of the supply and/or the quality of the medium for exchange in regard to its value. Arbitrarily changing the block size absolutely destroys this quality.
Also remembering gresham's law that BAD money supplants the Good!

But there was a limit, and now you forget about market theory.   That the markets possibly knew the limit wasn't going to be changed (if it never does) and so they are already invested in whatever the fact is to be.

@_date: 2017-03-16 00:52:51
I give the same argument for segwit as well. It ignores bitcoin’s gold like properties and assumes that scaling bitcoin’s transactions per second will raise its value. We need to consider not messing with bitcoin’s value proposition whatsoever and neither proposal considers this because they both start with the tacit assumption that increasing bitcoin’s tps solves a significant problem.
I believe you will be one of the first mainstream bitcoiners to realize this because you are thinking outside of the community’s box already.
It’s obvious once you drop the tacit assumption.

Also I'll bet you I'm more well read on the subject at hand. The other thing is, other than obvious trolls, insincere people, and cynics, when it comes to this topic, it often doesn't take more than a few exchanges (and some time to digest or think in a different direction) before some people often begin to consider my view, that there is a great validity in bitcoin as a settlement layer.
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:16:30
I think we'll be settlement fine!
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:17:42
No no.  Lets be clear...


The above is true...


This has no supporting evidence.  Satoshi talked about how it could be done, people warned him this would create a storm of a debate and eventually become impossible.  Satoshi never replied and disappeared.
There is no evidence to support what you say or you would have posted it.  Most importantly he did not explicit suggest that we should avoid a fee market or scale to visa. As I understand it was widely seen as impossible. 
What I understand is this is difficult for the masses to understand, because they want the quick easy way, regardless of its impracticability.

Andreas is an idiot that sells snake oil-don't listen to him.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:39:20
Absolutely included it: 
Again the reality is, there is nothing explicate, and peoples begged him not to do it because it was obvious this would happen.  Satoshi never responded.  More importantly scaling or change the block-size is far different than trying to maintain a coffee money scale.  
So if you start from a conclusion bitcoin needs to be a coffee money you might argue that was Satoshi's intent.  But if you look at the fact with no bias, he never said that.
@_date: 2016-03-20 22:58:02
There is also implication here that bitcoin's code was created not from the single event of conception but rather through iterations over-time.  And there is also allusion to a great machine Szabo designed that involves modulated layers.

you hold gold but you haven't looked at the price charts for gold ever?
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:42:17
Even so that is to a lesser magnitude than trying to scale bitcoin to Visa.  And besides I believe bitcoin should be changed in this regard as little as possible.  So you might agree with me even more than core if this is really your contention.
In other words core agrees some change is necessary but hopefully as little change in this regard as possible (least authority!)
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:02:25
everyone has a agreed since Satoshi is the one that put the block-size limit down and secretly intended bitcoin to be a settlement system, then we are going to keep it this way.
@_date: 2016-03-05 03:36:27
Everybody already knows this isn't true, thats why we are having a debate about what the block size should be.
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:26:48


This is a lie.  It's deception twisting, and complete ignorance to truth. If Satoshi was explicate there would be no debate.

@_date: 2016-01-29 08:11:18
I may have missed the scope somewhat, but the need for consensus seems to give the minority a veto.  
Cost I worry is too limited of a word.  I am not sure what would replace it with. 


To me this is about the economics YOU aren't picking up on.  The social cost of doing a significant/contentious hard fork could be disastrous.  It might set our society back years because of our unwillingness to adopt something new that previously failed.  So its a REALLY big deal.
I realize one might counter that we cannot let transaction volume max out, but that worry doesn't seen weigh bigger than a system that already works
bitcoin might be more secure with higher value, but there are ways the pursuit of higher value could also threaten bitcoin's security, and you do not address this in your post.
There is a belief that a fee market and high costs to use bitcoin would kill it.  But there is no merit to these suggestions, we don’t' have empirical evidence for it, and I think it can be perfectly argued that a system with scarce amount of transactions in this sense could be quite valuable as well.
Of course the peoples and users might not understand this value and so the majority might be vocal about not letting bitcoin become that.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:29:13
Another "possible" "rational" explanation might be that bitcoin's nature is such that it attracts new users that cannot help but enter the community with ignorance. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 03:05:24
Only the well read players yes.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:23:11


I can certainly agree to some extent with much of your sentiments and we have been in dialogue about this to great length.  However, I think this is a good example, because we might rather see that the fundamental problem here is not finding a solution but perhaps in bringing about coherence and consensus among the community.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:01:02
I have what I think is a solid reasoning that bitcoin must have came to be through iterative attempts.  I suspect the pyramids were built the same.  Basically I suspect bitcoin's implementation from "satoshi" was not written from scratch.  I suspect some of the great pyramids' stone were also re-used.  This would confuse timelines and conceal contributions. 
Good luck!  I'll read your essay and attempts!
(I wasn't correcting you.  I don't do that, just mean to quote the last line and had to clarify!)
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:09:25
I know what you mean!
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:21:15


You are implying that a smaller block size will stifle adoption, which isn't at all true.  You imply bitcoin's block size must be increased to support a money cheaper to use, and this will increase adoption.  Its not true. "Ease" of use in this context is not a significant factor.  Predictability is the key. Threatening to change the implied nature of bitcoin destroys this stability.  This is clear.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:57:37

I agree to some extent this may not be intuitive and for this I appreciate what appears to be a sincere question from you.  Upon further inquiry, I suspect we can in fact see the truth of this though.  We might start with negation:  Can we expect to solve a problem we don't understand?

Again, I am going to pose to you my very simple point: How are you arguing multiple randos knew AT THE TIME that years later this debate would happen...but Satoshi didn't?
Are you sure you are "speculating" in an intelligent fashion?  Or are you trying to paint a story that doesn't match REALITY?
You told me to read the dialogue that happened in the past.  I think YOU need to read it and ask yourself if Satoshi is really that much of an idiot that he couldn't see something so obvious that multiple people were pointing out...
He ignored their complaints, and I think I know why.

Centrally planned, from the view of Hayek, is not relevant here imo.  Central planning would be a group of block changers that believe they have the proper vision and foresight to idealize the block size.

@_date: 2016-01-22 19:15:32
You might be a little confused here on what you are implying.  Not sure.  Profits going to zero is not the users concern.  But what it really means is not there will be no profit, but a race to lower production cost, which is a good thing because it suggests for example bitcoin is creating incentive for a new cheaper energy source etc.
Not sure if you thought it implied something negative that profits trend toward zero.

core is not an entity, its a mix mashes of people who are interested in working on bitcoin.

You are being sincere; I will be sincere.
If we are only asking the question from one perspective: should block size be planned or not planned? Then of course you are correct in what you point out. But this misses hayek's point.
There are some institutions, and they way they have arisen, that we as an ignorant society believe to be forward looking (for example keyneisn inflation targeting).  And furthermore we believe these institutions arose from insight and intuition. That we designed them. But it is not so, nor could it ever be possible to design these systems from the conceptual realm and these institutions could not possibly be forward looking.
The belief that this possible and how things arose is the fatal conceit.  The belief that we can create a system in which a central body or a subset of the population could accurately planning something so complex is more likely to be the downfall of society.  In regard to the block size debate, the belief that we can target an optimal block size is foolish.  We cannot.  We do not have the data needed and our ability to radically change the block size diminishes over time because of the complexity of achieving consensus. 
Any attempts at optimizing the blocksize in this regard is arbitrary and therefore damaging to the stability of the movement from a different perspective.  In short if you change your perspective you can see that what I say holds true and is inline with Hayek, and this very fact should cause one to reconsider and to at least attempt to weigh both perspectives.
I bet if you read the fatal conceit you would agree.
To plan blocksize as we go, is the fatal conceit.  To leave it as is, and design around it, is the non-keynesian, hayakian rule.

There is more though.  Perspective, or rather incorrect or incoherent perspective, often creates unnecessary problems and paradoxes.  In this context, to understand a problem, is really to see it from the correct angle, or to see (or act!) from the view that resolves the problem or paradox. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 00:39:19
I can agree with this to some extent, however I fear we have stepped outside the context.  We want to get from A to C but B is in the way.  We exhaust all our methods to surpass B but alas they fail.  Then I think we can only make progress by better understanding the problem.  The concentration on solutions, such as brute force, in some ways, in some instances, especially with difficult problems, are often the root cause of the difficulty itself.  I don't suspect you intend to argue this.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:02:18

Nash's theory is that an international e-money might arise in the form of a stabley issued supply that will asymptotically take the power of the hands of governments and central banks to print money.

And the telegraph that killed the pony express!  But you see we should want to have the ability to quantify the pace at which technology progresses.  This would be useful for understanding how we might advance, and even how life on other planets might advance and evolve.  In this I think technology is just evolution, and strong money systems allows for units of measurement that give us the possibility of optimizing this evolution. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:41:55
We tend to conflate value and price in regard to volitility.  As long we continue to compare bitcoin to other currencies and commodities that are not necessarily themselves stable then bitcoin's price will not be stable obviously. 
but bitcoin offers a very stable value proposition, and it is known for having decreasing volatility. 
This happens as it matures and its price matches its underlying objective value, more and more.
We don't really have words that allow us to distinguish between value and price in this manner, but the idea is once this happens our currencies will begin to stabilize in value too.
then the process will cause our currencies (fiat) to become ideal, not bitcoin necessarily.

@_date: 2017-03-11 07:06:00
Right but now it seems to me that is a developer's view.  I heard this from Erik L. and I didn't understand it and now I do.  From a customer of fiat though, or from a macro-economics related view, some people, myself including, are more interested in bitcoin as an inflation hedge, and so a full node isn't relevant.
So then there is only a smaller portion of players (which includes businesses like exchanges) that it would be reasonable to suggest they should run a full node.
So if having a super majority is important, I think its not a sound argument that everyone or everyone that needs bitcoin should run a full node.
But also you might not need the critical amount of people running nodes, you might just need the threat of it.  I would certainly do it if there was some immediately eminent emergency (and ya'll said so).
That's how I'm understanding this from what you explain.

Because it will render bitcoin an unbreakable gold standard that all the nations can use as the backbone of our financial system.  This is different than bitcoin being adopted as a coffee money.  We had this system before, for example, bretton woods.  But it wasn't politically uncorruptable.  
Thanks for at least asking, I mean if you disagree, I hope you follow this possibility to test its validity at least.

Yes I don't often engage in this with others with such sincerity to the sentiments are likewise with you.
See I did something subtle.  I didn't prove you to be wrong, but I suggested from my view that your "un-plan" is really a new plan.  I am less interested in suggesting you mean to create a plan, but rather that Satoshi's size of 1mb is not a "plan", but rather the opposite.  By plan remember we mean hayek's use, not just the word fit to an accepted definition.  To say this in another way just because you point to an actual plan, does not mean it is the fatal central planning hayek warned about.
Hayek is more talking about the CONTINUAL adjustment of something that cannot actually be optimized by continually adjusting it (planning). So from MY view, to leave the block size alone, is to end the central planning of it.  And yes in one way that means to make a plan of leaving it alone, but this avoid the very pitfall hayek suggests (imo!).  
Now remember bitcoin is new, it doesn't perfectly align with what hayek was discussing.  But I can easily suggest we do not have the data to optimize blocksize.  The DIFFICULTY is that consensus for change gets more complex over time, so we cannot wait till we have the data, nor can we adjust it as we go.   We HAVE to lock something in place as we go, and we must do it sooner than later, so we are in dilemma.
That dilemma, with those difficulties render the problem closer to what Hayek talked about. Leave certain parameters alone, and let the natural order work around them (this is the opposite of central planning!).  The other way is to try to scale bitcoin to optimize the block size so that we can avoid things that we are not at all sure how to truly avoid this is the danger that people that think they will get rich if bitcoin scaled to visa avoid.  They are clouded by ignorance and greed. 
Keep in mind, although I am new to this myself, few of these peoples have read the literature.  Most important I urge you not to take my view and leave yours...but to contemplate mine, test it, run with it and see if you don't learn and grow from it.  then try to see who is in line with my sentiments and who isn't.  You will likely see things.

Open the dialogue, everyone: 
Both sides are wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:24:08
While being somewhat correct I think you are not being fair to theymos and the situation.  It's pretty clear to any sincere and rational player that there have been concerted attacks on this sub from the get-go.  And these attacks have been targeting DISRUPTION-they are not just a political view. 
The clear solution was to cut out the faction, which had a clear agenda.  
Moderation, and I am sure you know this or if not this is what you are missing, is necessary to ensure the freest speech possible. Theymos has done a hell of a good job at this. 
Me and you recently had some discourse on the core slack (unfortunately there are apparently no core devs there which was disappointing) about the relevance of John Nash's Ideal Money to bitcoin.  And you understood the basic idea quite quickly, seemed relatively interested, and suggested Trace Mayer would be interested in the subject (and that Roger Ver might actually be receptive to it as well).
You wouldn't have heard this, if it weren't for Theymos. 
Re: Trace... he talked about Bohm before and Bohm's relevance to bitcoin (holographic universe).  Trace would be interested in Nash's Ideal Money, but he would be FAR more interested in my insights to the relevance of Bohm and bitcoin and Bohm and Nash.
Most importantly, and you need to understand, and tell others.   Bohm proposed a protocol for communication that lifts tacit assumptions.  And it is tacit assumptions that are perpetuating this debate.
Both sides are guilty of these tacit assumptions, and dialogue, BOHMIAM dialogue, with a few key players on either side of the conflict will alleviate it. 
**Both sides are under a mistaken assumption that we can make bitcoin a better or great medium of exchange, and that doing so solves an important problem.  It doesn't.  This world needs a stable mechanism for valuation. Money COULD provide that, but bitcoin CANNOT be stable because it is deflationary.  Bitcoin is something ELSE.  Bitcoin COULD be made to be the premise of John Nash's ideal money, and if it COULD be made fit this premise, then EVERYONE is being petty right now.**
We need dialogue:

We don't have time.  There is a technique I have learned in regard to solving complex and massive problems.  That is, if we can find a sort of compass we can cut out a lot of the possible lines that might be used to solve such a problem (ie which way to take bitcoin together).  
Here I think such a technique could be useful here.... 
You are effectively trying to solve the problem of how to optimize the social communication network (ie the bitcoin community) by optimizing the platform used for communication. But the reason you are doing it is to bring coherence to the community, not for optimization in itself. 
We want to bring forth the best argument for what direction to take bitcoin.
And we want to do it in such away that it brings coherence to our collective awareness so that the optimal path for bitcoin can be chosen (ie once we see what is right, we need to take the correct action together).  
Bitcoin has a chance to be the premise of John Nash's Ideal Money, and players are starting to understand this: 
This is the correct way forward.   We don't need to build a new free speech platform.  We simply need some of the elite to understand Nash's argument and why its significant and relevant to bitcoin's block size debate. 
This will end it. Its the reasonable rational scientifically founded argument.
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:50:08
Its a strange power though isn't it?  The intelligent minority can veto, but it cannot put through negative changes the rest of the whole doesn't want.  So I see, I think that you mean to suggest there is great power to veto...but no division of the whole unfairly gets that power in such a way that another does not...
its just a realization that there is no way for a majority to force a decision a minority doesn't like.
It means change in many ways is either extremely difficult or nearly possible.
But don't take the perspective that because one group can veto what you want they hold unfair power over you, thats not at all what such a setup does.  You get that same right as well, its equitable.

Again like others you are saying bitcoin must be a coffee money and therefore a transaction cap stifles its adoption.  Also you say "effectively" caps because it doesn't necessary cap users at all.  Only if you want it to seem that way. 
There are many uses for many things in this world, and many uses for the blockchain that do not involve a coffee money.  It's complete deception to suggest there can only be one path to "adoption", and adoption in this sense is something you simply define as being a coffee money.
"bitcoin must be a coffee money because it needs adoption so it can be a coffee money."

There are a few ways to look at this, but basically this is why things are expensive on the black market (illegal and thus harder to get).  Such laws don't necessarily temper the demand. 
We can also think game theoretically and observe that in the beginning governments and central banks might have wanted to suppress the adoption of such technology and digital currencies but as adoption gets inevitable it becomes increasingly obvious that those that do not participate in the market and innovation will be left behind.  Advisor of these decision makers are crystal clear on that.
So the theory is that because canada doesn't suppress it china won't, and since china is participates the us must etc.
It was theory but now its reality.

There is some sentiments that the markets being the ultimate objective intelligence, could not nor would not put the value into bitcoin it already has if it was doomed.  Thats conjecture though of course.
Bitcoin must have demand that pays for the cost of producing them and so far it seems it does.  There is some demand for its utility as a ledger/proof system beyond simple transactions.  But there is also seemingly demand in regard to what level of safe haven bitcoin might prove to be in the future.  Even if fiat money increases in quality to "ideal", if bitcoin was a partial catalyst for that then it certainly has "value" up until our money systems evolve to be better quality than it at least.

So to me, this and especially the way I here Eric L. put it, is a weak argument...if its a problem it needs a solution which can't be an appeal to reason.

But this is what I mean to point out, bitcoin is competing with monetary polices that traditionally didn't function in relation to it but in the near future might be forced to.  There is the possibility of "idealness" and so eventually all of the currency might simply be comparable. 
In regard to banning bitcoin, its basically been shown such a scenario is impossible and especially because useful banned goods naturally raise in price on the markets.

He goes through the ins and outs of what is good money vs bad money, why gold worked, y it didn't work, and what other commodities may or may not work.
He talks about the different intrinsic difficulties we might have and how to solve them.
He talks about how the peoples might react in different game theoretical ways in regard to such a money and how the end game will create a quality of fiat we cannot otherwise fathom.

If you design a system that requires consensus for change, from a segment of the population that is large enough to include the benevolent intelligent segment, then it will be socially robust from self-destructive changes.
For example if there are 10% of peoples in the world that might understand the importance of a certain principle of a system, then you might set the consensus needed for change at 91%.


There is a majority forming but it seems consensus has been a long long time coming, not arrived at all.


Yes but you made the circles and logic here.  We want to avoid significant changes that approach uncharted water.  That is what is "contentious", changes we don't have empirical evidence for.  It's a sensical thing to be cautious about if you put it this way.


Without empirical evidence, effectively all choices are random, Satoshi's best guess may or may not be better than ours, but paradoxically we need consensus for change, and rational people will not join a significant proposal that unnecessary enters uncharted waters.


Your theory is that it would die, I don't believe it would.  Nonetheless my opinion is only that.  You need consensus for change, not majority. I understand the fee market, and the economics, and consensus just well enough I think.


The core dev's are obviously of the most intelligent in the community, nonetheless they are not purely in control.  They are just pointing out you need consensus for your wants to become bitcoin protocol.

Thats the point, we have no stable metric for value.  Value being subject is a problem.  It's REALLY subjective, but since we have no measurement device for it we fight over it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:16:17
Its a multi level questions.  "Classically" bitcoin would stabilize our currency system and become our global currency.  Eventually though "governments" might chose to use bitcoin as their "gold standard", and print money based on what "bitgold" amounts they own.  This would demonetize gold and the defacto usd standard etc.
We should keep in mind bitcoins halving rate is such that most of the coins have already been released.  
But if we understand the history of money, it has somewhat based through "dimensions" in regards to technology, and we should expect then to be higher level "money", that replaces bitcoin as a currency. 
In that I think ultimately bitcoin will function as a super gold, always.  And bitcoin 2.0 (ethereum counterparty) etc. will become "current".
As for your question about "hoarding", you are right in reality that wouldn't make sense, but thankfully the solution "asymptotically ideal money" bypassed that paradox.  I hope you understand what i mean here, and that makes your questions relevant and intelligent I think!

@_date: 2017-03-06 07:01:56
yes.  It changes the market valuation, and by "ideal" we mean predictability/stability of value... so we threaten to "shake" it.  And there is no pressure to scale the tp/s because bitcoin can't be ideal money anyways, it can never be stable in value. its an irrational means to an irrational ends, and thats bad.
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:36:28




This is where you are going.  Ideal Money means stable in value.  Gold has historically been expected to have a deflationary trend in relation to fiat.  Gold is fairly stable in value. 
bitcoin is VERY comparable to it, but it is also deflationary.  bitcoin gains in value over time, therefore it is not stable, and since Ideal Money is stable in value, bitcoin cannot be ideal money.

Seemingly there is a difficulty in regard to greshams law.  Given a good money and a bad money peoples will tend to hoard the good and use the bad...
hoarding in this sense seems to make adoption difficult.
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:19:27
In an efficient market value = price.  value = true price in that sense, then yes.
We have no metric for value, so its not describable.  We can say something is $x usd, but that doesn't help us if the usd itself is not stable. 
If we had a stable metric like "stable units" we could valuate things in those units and the observations would hold. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:01:02
No it is true, its fake.  Kristovs point was fake.  And now you are implying kristov said fiverr removed bitcoin, but thats not what he said, you can see in the picture that is quoted.

@_date: 2016-01-26 18:45:17
Something I think you might not be considering.  There is no such "fee" especially that is created by the market that unfairly, unjustly, immorally, incorrectly, or illogically, price certain users out of using bitcoin. 
If $1000 fees are approached (I'm not convinced a usd figure is appropriate) then there is something implication that bitcoin's usefulness is such that $1000 fess are appropriate.  
I think your question implies that $1000 fees would not be favourable for bitcoin but the reality is that it doesn't fit YOUR agenda and there is no logical argument that fees should be x or less than x etc.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:52:16
It literally WAS designed to have large fees and Satoshi never said we would remove the 1mb limit.

but bitcoin can have a different price on different exchanges, how can something have two different values if its only one thing?  Price can be wildly different if the exchange is rigged one one exchange.  Value is the underlying truth, price is an attempt to express this truth, but price doesn't always reflect value.

@_date: 2016-01-21 00:32:38
Actually I might not have understood you.  Typically people think Satoshi's "voice" said "we should scale bitcoin to visa"  where as I seem to think his actions suggest 1mb or something very similar would suffice for all time.
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:00:17
I think I understand this more. It has to do with the balance between it being feasible to run your own node or leting exchanges do it.  Which is related to the transactability of bitcoin.  So big blockers could use it as an argument against bitcoin as a settlement layer perhaps. 
Or in other words whether bitcoin should be a coffee money (the 1st layer) or not is relevant quote of Satoshi's in the OP.
If we target it wrong we will create inflation like you say yes. 
The correct target is not the highest decentralization possible but sufficient decentralization. That's what Eric isn't preaching, and I suppose you aren't either.
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:37:15
Yes that is a lot different, isn't it, then saying, we WILL do x by y time...or we MUST do "this" at "this" time...etc.
I often get told I am putting words in Satoshi's mouth, yet I am simply pointing out he didn't not AT ALL explicitly say that bitcoin is to be and must be scaled to be a coffee money.
He didn't say that at all.
What is more important is that IMMEDIATELY (as in next few posts) after he posted that stuff 3 people pointed out this difficult and unfavorable block size debate would be inevitable.  
If they saw this, Satoshi saw this.  And so he must have purposefully ignored the conversation.

Assuming you mean he or they aren't perfect (rather than it was a different person or group from early to later one), this is why I try to reach as high up I can. 
It's obvious, or seemingly, that there are tiers of people "in the know".  
But what is unclear is if anyone really understands what I am pointing out in regard to the lecture Ideal Money.
Bitcoin COULD be kept to be the premise of the argument, and its important than to know if CORE and any of the elite understand this or not.
Because I haven't found anyone that even admits to traversing the work sincerely, let alone anyone who admits to understanding it. 
I KNOW its relevant, and I KNOW its significant.  
And so what if Satoshi didn't, and what if CORE doesn't?
THAT'S why I seem irrational.  I'll be forgiven in the (near) future.
But how silly it will be that we ignored 20 years of lecture on the advent of an e-currency with a stable supply and the macro-economic implications of it.

To me this is a more accurate observation of the actual scope of the problem.  The issue is these sides are trying to resolve each other, whereas the true nature of the problem arises from the division which is the attempt to resolve each other.  
In other words, we should put to the community, the question: Can we each step back for a moment, and simply observe the division, but not try to solve it!?

Maturity will be related to your blog with the points below


That would be unintelligent and so you have contradicted yourself and its clearly your subjective opinion which devs with high IQ clearly wouldn't agree with 


They have a high IQ


Because they have higher IQ's (ie this is rational for them to think)


Nonsensical to say.


Then you shouldn't be alluding to it.


Again subject point, unnecessary blame. And you are calling a team of high IQ individuals incompetent.  Is it possible you are simply confused?


You admitted you have no idea if there is a likelihood or not.


No, you admit the core devs are calling for purdent planning, you and others are calling for immediate action.


Is this prudent planning?


Is this prudent planning, does this help?  Is this a slippery slope?  Is kicking the can favorable?


Go on...




Former.  Did they leave because they didn't understand bitcoin perhaps?


You want to fork the team.


Yes you want to defeat the current consensus mech Satoshi left us with.


You are about to contradict yourself again....


Is this prudent?  Is this democratic?  Is this dictator language?


No.  Your agenda.


How do we mitigate fud?


Yes let's overthrow core. Coupe right?


Ummmm.... do you understand what you just did/said here?


No they don't that's why we can't reach consensus for change.


The system is such that you cannot change the constitutional framework.  The system is such that the peoples can not vote against their own natural rights.  The system is such that divided powers cannot over reach 


No it doesn't.  This is the nature of the problem that we ACTUALLY face


Again, your subjective opinion.


Why is the American constitutional infrastructure based on the separation of powers? Why does Nick Szabo present this to us in readeable form?


what are these couple dozen qualified comp scientists suggesting?


You said this already, but it presupposes FUD


Only because you have said so like 5 times.

We need something stable in this world.  The problem is no one can possibly foresee optimal block size, so planning for it is really arbitrary.  When we talk about central planning and the dangers of it, this is exactly what Hayek is talking about: the belief we can optimize something that we actually can't.
keynesian economics is an evolution of exactly that dangerous principle that cannot but lead to instability.  
My view, vs what you suggest, is that we cannot optimize bitcoin for all the purposes we wish we could, but we can optimize its stability in a certain sense, and then work on top of that stability.  
In other words, sometimes the long way is really the short way.
Nonetheless thank you for the sincerity!

I certainly don't expect the majority to agree, and so I think we both support that rationality in that regard.  As for changes I propose.

Here is a good primer: 
Your constitution is set so that it cannot be changed easily.  The framework was set to including your basic freedoms that express your natural rights.  The "5%" you talk about is a backwards perspective.  The mechanism protects minorities (the 5%), so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the few.   You should favor the highest amount possible in regard to 75-95.
The fact that you argue for the opposite is exactly why I am glad both your national and bitcoin's constitutional consensus mechanisms exists.

That's because you have drowned out MY argument.  The 1mb cap is not a magic number, you are asking the wrong question.  It's whether or not the existing limit (which happens to be 1mb) should be CHANGED.
And I don't think it should be.  It wouldn't matter to me if it was 2mb or 4mb, I will still advocate not changing it. 
My argument is based on Nash, Hayek, Szabo, and Smith, that suggest that bitcoin serves us best as a digital gold and that making such arbitrary changes destroy its properties as a digital gold.

No bitcoin is a conjecture, that you can create an equilibrium that will sustain security through the value it creates.  These attacks you speak of are FUD.  Not science.  We should expect bitcoin to perfectly and obviously hold true. The holes in the code were implementation, small leaks, not problems with the conjecture.  The implementation you speak of is how you tell people to shut up and that the conjecture is valid.

@_date: 2017-03-06 05:37:36


Yes you are correct that the supply must be able to expand and contract in regard to the underlying economy in order to be stable, therefore bitcoin cannot be stable in value.  But you are wrong that its impossible for a stable money to exist, thats why John Nash spent 20 years explaining how it will.
@_date: 2016-06-15 02:21:32
Yes I have made my argument based on accepted science, and you want to claim it is countered by science that is not yet accepted because we do not have historical data to analyze in this regard.
But you fail to realize I am not guessing here. I am translating 60+ years of work by Dr. Nash which is meditation on the subject of how to issue an electronic currency in such a way that it brings our global financial system in order.
You can cry all you want.  But the simple observable, common sense fact, is that rational players hoard money that is expected to increase in value, and they spend money that is decreasing in value. 
And one cannot hoard what one is circulating, and neither can one circulate what they are hoarding.  One does not have what one has parted with, and one cannot part with what one will not let go of.
This are simple truths and to try to defeat them with sentiments is insincere.
The fallacy is the belief that CORE will accept an unscientific argument.  The fallacy is that there is a scientific argument for big-blocks.  There is not, I have now shown this and many people have understood me.
The debate is babies cry vs science.  It is not a debate with science on both sides.
You cannot move the block-size with your fear and sadness that bitcoin won't be what you thought it was.  I am well read on this subject, you clearly are not.

This doesn't add up scientifically.  You are saying that people are hoarding it because they believe it will go up in value, and then somehow you are adding in that people will also willingly and rationally part with this increasing value in a style that involves velocity and mass circulation.
This are to two different ends.  This is clear and accepted economic law.

In the following years, Nash frequently delivered a lecture titled “Ideal
Money and Asymptotically Ideal Money” (see Nash 2003) building on the earlier
article. A report on a lecture by Nash at Brown University contains this account of
his comments on the idea of a global currency:
Nash responded with caution to the suggestion from an audience
member that a system of currencies approaching perfect stability
would ultimately produce a system with only one world currency.
“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Nash said. But he added, “In
practice, I’m a little distrustful of the politicians at the level of the
United Nations and elsewhere,” who would be in charge of
administering a world currency. (Zuckerman 2005)

@_date: 2016-06-12 23:17:57
Yes I believe I understand your sentiments, so core operates like this: lets not change anything that could potentially tamper with security.  
So sometimes security flaws MUST be addressed because it doesn't stand to reason that attempts to FIX security are likely to harm security.
But starting from an arbitrary conclusion saying "we need to raise blocksize cap because we MIGHT be losing opp cost" puts an unNECESSARY strain on security.


You are thinking of bitcoin in regard to how many tx/s the block size allows.  To me this is not what is important.  To me what is important is to not CHANGE bitcoin fundamentally. Let it grow into whatever it will, provided whatever the current block size is.
If the blocksize today were 2 mb or .5 or 20 or 100.  My argument would remain, we should try to change the fundamental implied nature of bitcoin.  No need to go up or down.
(by the way one core dev wants smaller blocks, as I understand).
 
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:16:27
You didn't make a poitn about 3tps not being enough even for hoarding.  Thats non-sensical to say, and you don't have any reasoning or science to back that ridiculous assertion up.
**Hoarding means you aren't making transactions.**  Circulating MEANS you are NOT hoarding.
You are conflating 2 separate phenomenon that are mutually exclusive. Like asking why can't blue be green or why can't up also be down.
@_date: 2016-06-09 02:38:18
Price stability isn't really what I mean to say.  Everything else's value being comparable to bitcoin might be useful, but it is not the same things as saying bitcoin will be circulated as an currency.
Regardless it still stands to reason that a necessary step is in regards to having the different national and centrally banked currency to play ball and move in order with each other.  
Ideal Money must be a global phenomenon, this is what is key.

Nice try.  I don't dismiss it.  But you can't base an argument for changing block-size based on "Who knows, maybe opportunity cost is being lost?!"
There is not rational argument there, just fear uncertainty and doubt of the possibility of loss, no actual proof evidence or argument for it.
@_date: 2016-06-15 06:21:05


Lol, no, this isn't a thing.  You are still stuck on the belief that spending a currency gives it value.  Hoarding gives it value in this context. Hoarding it and using it for something.  Circulating it does not bring up the value in any context.

@_date: 2016-06-12 20:46:38
Well we same to agree on the nature and difficulty, or namely impossibility of proof in this regard.  I speak to the sentiments of "big-blockers" and I am simply pointing out then, that there is no scientific basis for change.  This suggests there will be no change, and no change is rational in regard to security and stability.
It might not be optimal in regard to opportunity cost, but I have shown here that there is not basis for risk security and stability, other than FUD but with not stats (because we both agree such stats or "proof" cannot exist).
For example it is true that I cannot provide proof that we aren't missing out on opportunity cost, but I don't need to prove anything to keep the block size cap the same.  It already is what it is.

What are you suggesting in regard to the block-size to achieve this?
@_date: 2016-06-14 22:07:33
The price of a commodity or a money is not necessarily at all directly proportional to its transactability. If there are not enough transactions to go around this does not destroy the money, the scarcity drives up the price, provided the money is valueable for something other than circulation-inflation hedging.
Trust me, it stands up to accepted science and economic theory, it stands to reason, it is common sense, and observable reality.  Don't laugh at me because its not inline with your conclusion and you have not given it as much thought as me or Nash.


Sir nobody can hold a candle to me in regard to macro economics, just because my points go contrary to yours, do not assume I do not have a strong grasp on the material.

@_date: 2016-06-13 09:40:27


Please don't miss my point.  What I am saying is you need a scientific argument (ie data observations conclusion = scientific argument NOT simply referring to scientific concepts) to change the block size...
Here is the thing, please understand...
I do NOT, need such an argument to NOT change the block size.  
Bitcoin stands unless a scientific argument changes it.  I don't have to do anything.
If you think you have a reasonable argument, go see if the block size change.  It won't have. There isn't one.


I am waiting for an approval for an article I wrote that explains bitcoin cannot do both and this is why big-blockers are proposing something irrational.  If bitcoin continues to go up in value then it will be used as an inflation hedge and the peoples will not circulate it.
People circulate inflationary currencies and hoard deflationary ones (relative).  This is called Gresham's law. And it is exactly observable in the real world.
big blockers don't understand the nature of money.
In regard to bitcoin as a gold, this renders it to be the crux of the argument John Nash' proposes for how to bring about Ideal Money:
bitcoin as a coffee money is petty.  Ideal Money far exceeds what you are dreaming of. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:13:35
No you are ignoring reason and science.  People will not circulate an asset that is perceived to be steadily rising in value.  Doesn't matter how many tx/s.  This is obvious.  Our WHOLE global financial system runs based on this principle.

Yes but governments/central banks, as rational self interested actors view currency manipulation as a positive.  So there is something needed to bring them into order.  We have properly described the triffin dilemma, which somehow wiki cites Nash's Ideal Money as the solution to.  And which is effectively the introduction of a "decent money" in regard to "gold", that completes/introduces the missing axiom (hint: read the last paragraph/line first!):

@_date: 2016-06-14 19:02:42
My argument is more that there is no scientific basis to raise the block size.  large blockers suggest we need to tend to "price" as an ends (whatever the means, but they think it is bigger blocks), and this will encourage circulation.  But when price/value goes up people will circulate bitcoin less, because an increased price encourages hoarding.
If you want people to circulate and spend a money, then the trick is to inflate it.  This not only common sense, but observable reality in our current global financial system.

\&gt; The mantra of “hodl” is absolutely counter to the idea that bitcoin might become an inclusive and ubiquitous world currency (not that I even think it must be scaled so every user has their own sovereignty). Scaling in this sense is petty-I have long expressed this. Bitcoin’s greatest use case is to serve to optimize our existing legacy systems-not to bring them down.
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:45:44
No.  What you point out has nothing to do with my reasoning or conclusions.  My reasoning is based on the same reasoning we use to determine the sun will come up tomorrow, and my point is clear as day.  
We circulate bad money and hoard good money, this is accepted science and observably true. A currency in its very infancy does not disprove this important and relevant point.
@_date: 2016-06-09 04:52:22
there are nearly no major merchants, and we are very far from global adoption.  But thats not what matters, what matters is that if there is a perceive expectation of an increase in value, the markets will hoard and not circulate.  This is truth and accepted science. The players that try to argue this are basing their reasoning on their conclusion.
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:42:39

The ability for the markets to find confidence in bitcoin as a store of value/gold has nothing to do with increasing the size of the block cap.  The cap is about increasing transaction capacity, which is related to circulation, not hoarding. 
bitcoin does not need many transactions per second to be hoarded. 
Furthermore arbitrarily scaling bitcoin to arbitrary goals is what destroys the markets confidence in bitcoin, and when the markets are not confident they cannot seek safety in it.
You have said something non-nonsensical.

@_date: 2016-06-09 04:21:56
That is not an indication that bitcoin can be circulated on a global scale, it just means its still in bootstrap phase.  When you say accpeted academic fact doesn't mean much, you are removing yourself from dialogue involving reasonable people (they won't engage with you if you refuse to accept reason).
As I said you have provided no counter argument against the obvious point that a hodl'd asset cannot be circulated.  the markets do not circulate "good money".  This is fact.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:58:01
People hoard good money, they do not circulate it.  The fact that you can not see logic in such a simple statement is a testament to the fact that you do not understand the nature of money.  Nonetheless it is accepted science and observable reality.
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:22:02
No you have not spoken in context.  It is rational economic science that people want to spend what is inflating and save what is deflating.  Our financial system is not screwed up because it is based on this scientific fact. 
A lot of deflation does not cause people to spend this is going against the very rational point of science we are discussing.  You can't just "say" otherwise, you are refuting science with no data, no evidence, and no papers.  Bitcoin's history does not show this, bitcoin is not even accepted barely anywhere as a currency.  
It is quite obvious, a hoarded currency does not circulate, that is BASIC law of economics.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:57:11
Because it would destroy the quality of money in the Gresham/Nashian sense.  If you want people to spend/circulate/use bitcoin rather than hoard (because they cannot do both), then seek to devalue it and destroy it, because that is what causes people to circulate a money.

You are missing the point, and doing so purposefully, and pretend it doesn't exist is not going to change the block size.
You don't have an argument rooted in science.  And because of that Core will not accept the big-blocker agenda as a proposal. 
You don't have to convince me, or the readers, or this thread, there is nothing that is going to change that-it is simple truth.  You don't have an argument rooted in science. 


Yes I realize you don't see change as change.  But your perception and opinion don't mean anything here.  In order to CHANGE bitcoin's block size, you need and argument rooted in science.  And saying the phrase "opportunity cost" does not make the argument scientific. 
We don't have the data you are trying to refer to, and using Apple which is a completely different business model, does not provide that data.
I understand your argument seems reasonable to you, but do you understand that Core is not listening to arguments not rooted in science?
You can reply to me until you are blue...

And so you are telling yourself there is a debate, and believing that you are having an effect on the future of bitcoin.  I am not here to convince you otherwise...
There are many people here that are understanding through me, that your opinion and sentiments, don't actually have an effect on anything and what we are watching is bitcoin grow into a gold, that people will hoard and not circulate.
The reality is there is not meaningful debate, bitcoin just is taking time to flourish...

Bitcoin was meant to be very inflated in the beginning which helps adoption, but as the inflation schedule decreases rational actors will not circulate a currency that is expected to appreciate in value.

@_date: 2016-06-15 00:07:25
If you give a me a little patience I can straighten this out (you seems sincere enough).  You are conflating your definitions with mine which is not useful for either of us. We do not have to agree on our conclusions but in order for me to pass my insight onto you then for at least a brief moment we must be allowed to agree on the definitions of certain words, so that I may be allowed to use them in a context that we share.
Nash has taken great pains to make these definitions and I extend them and their purpose to you.
GOOD money, is not what you think that it is.  In fact, as I quote in another essay, Nash explains that we have been sold the belief that BAD money is GOOD money.  Doesn't make sense yet right?
What this means, in the context today, is that the money that people choose to circulate will always be the money that is inflationary, or declining in value, or losing its purchasing power.  Hot potato money, if you know the game and the reference.
This is the money our governments have given us.  It is BAD money.  It is not good money just because they people choose to use it to spend and purchase things.
GOOD money, does not lose its purchasing power over time.  Gold has historically been good money.  People do NOT spend GOOD money (remember I mean GOOD money by MY and Nash's definition) rather people HOARD this kind of money.
Nobody does spend a deflationary currency, not when they also have the option of spending their deflationary counter part.


Its a perfectly reasonable question that dissolves when we are no longer confusing our definitions.  Inflation by definition devalues a currency and makes it bad money. But so too does upsetting the political security behind the nature of the currency.  The latter is not inflation, you are correct to point that out, but it still degrades the quality of the money.
My quote:




You are conflating hoarding and circulating.  How can someone both NOT circulate a currency AND circulate it?  How can someone be hoarding and NOT hoarding a unit of money at the same time?  
That is as absurd as saying what is up is also down, what is left, is not left, but rather to the right.
You cannot hoard and circulate at the same time, such a statement is a logical absurdity.


You don't have an argument to raise the transaction capacity.  All you are attempting to do is give people the ability to circulate bitcoin, but peopel will not want to circulate it, because they will want to hoard it.


Because a politically stable money that is not subject to future change is something that markets will hoard because it is seen as safe.  If you constantly threaten to change the nature of it then it will no longer be seen as "GOOD MONEY" (remember I am using MY definition of good, not yours).


Yes I agree, except you are implying something that is scientifically invalid.  You are implying we need to raise the tps, so that more people can circulate bitcoin and then price will go up and everyone will be right.  This is non-sense.  Increasing the cap, or even the very THREAT of increasing the cap in order to facilitate this, has a determental effect on the markets ability to find confidence in bitcoin as a safe haven. 
Bitcoin is GOOD money left the way it is (my definition = people will hoard it), if you change the nature of it, in regard to the block cap, then people will start to circulate bitcoin, they will spend it, they will part with it, and it will then be known as "BAD money", and you will kill the price with it.

In regard to our personal currencies, I have a German friend who really likes and wants this.  Of course this is related to what we call solving the centralized id problem.  I have written about this here: 
In which, ironically, we take ourselves back to wei dai's insights, and transmute HIS original crypto-currency plan, back into having HUMANS be the nodes that release the currencies. I think this and your suggestion probably rings well with marx if he has a labor value theory.
Szabo has written about how and why the world has and could have one or multiple currencies and his articles are linked in my blog.  He has plans to create a market translator, in which multiple currency can exist, without this translator, I believe he explains we arrive at a single currency to create a standard to solve the evaluation problem.
But the concept of currency that we hold today loses its meaning as these technologies and concepts arise.  What is a currency in the future but a continuation of the system we are building.  What is the difference between bitcoin and ethereum if they are stable vs each other, or predictable by market value for all time?
The purpose and meaning of money and currencies etc. is changing. 
Thanks for the comment theymos!

about a month.  there is a certain amount of demand for the currency now, and that is in relation to a constant supply, when the supply cuts in half, the demand will not really change, so there is an expectation that this will put upward pressure on the price.  People are still arguing about this, because in an efficient market, the price will already be accounted for...however, is 200 dollars worth the chance when you only have to wait like 30 days?
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:42:09
Thank you for stopping by (your time) sir.  
This is telling.  You haven't cited the macroeconomic implications, and so I must assume you haven't meditated on them.  Which was clear to me for other reasons anyways. 
People would spend it after they spent their volatile currency first, but there is a weird paradox of course that the merchants need to accept bitcoin, and employers sort of must not be repaying employees in fiat (or they will continue to re-circulate it like our economy works today). (there is also the point that fiat itself can also be strengthened in the hoard-able sense by monetary policies).
To your 2nd point this is true, but clearly not enough for adoption of a global currency, it flies in the face of a "money" that is worth hoarding and so economic science will not allow us to suggest that rational actors will mass circulate/adopt a currency in this state.
Its incoherent to suggest that a currency with a positive expected value will be both hoarded and circulated. There is not supporting argument for this.
@_date: 2016-06-11 06:16:55
Yes, but what "domestic region" are you referring to?  Or in other words, I might re-solve your view by suggesting that your "population" or segment of it, or subset, is determined by your currency.
National borders require national currencies.  The dissolution of nationalism requires the rise of a global currency etc...
So perhaps that is enough to say, or perhaps you have more insight in relation to this.

3.  hodlers eventually not hodling is quite different than my claim that people that percieve bitcoin to continue to rise in value will not circulate it en masse.
You are being silly.

Show me the empirical evidence that the transactions are generally people circulating the money and not having intent to hold onto it.
We see a problem with merchant adoption don't we?  This is what the gavin's the hearns the ver complain about...
Bitcoin is not turning out to be an accepted form of payment, but it IS growing in adoption isn't it...
But its not necessarily "circulating". 
Most importantly, a commodity, asset, or medium, in its early phase doesn't count as a scientific argument that supports either of our claim.  Science doesn't allow that.  There must be a reasonable amount of conclusive evidence based on PAST data not present moment.
Gresham's law is based on a history of data.  In the future bitcoin will be too.  
But big-blockers do not have the luxury of using current day data as an argument to change the block-size.
And the data does not support your conclusion regardless.  Of course it doesn't, its common sense, people hoard that which they feel is dear, and they part with that which they value less than a counterpart/option.
There is nothing to refute this.  Its scientifically accepted, its commons sense, we have historical data, and it is observable reality in our current finanical system (nearly all major nations are living historical proof that this phenomenon is true).

@_date: 2016-06-06 23:05:01
You are not on point.  My question, in regard to the way you are mis-understanding it, is basically asking why you would spend something that is increasing in value?  It is clearly an irrational act, and YOUR irrationality can NOT fuel global adoption.  ACCEPTED economic science does not support the argument a money perceived worth hoarding can be mass circulated/adopted.
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:36:14
Firstly your sentiments fly in the face of accepted economics.  More importantly they still do not support a theory of a mass adopted currency based on the excess value people make from the increased value.
When all rational actors are hoarding you cannot expect a currency to be circulated globally en masse.  The two are incomplete opposite direction of each other.
There is not empirical evidence that disprove it, it is accepted scientific fact for the very reason that evidence shows what I am pointing to be true is in fact valid.
Spending your bitcoin's when you could be spending inflationary currency is irrational, You cannot base adoption on irrational players.  This too flies in the face of science and reason.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:13:48
If the price continues to rise, it is scientifically impossible for bitcoin to become circulated as a global currency.
You don't understand money.
@_date: 2016-06-11 07:16:52
the supply of bitcoins gets cut in half.
@_date: 2016-06-09 03:25:20
That rule exists because governments/central banks have incentive to devalue their respective currencies to fuel "economic" motion.  Since bitcoin cannot do this, it is more likely to be hodl'd.  Getting rid of an asset, whether a money or not, that is expected to increase in value vs other assets is irrational.
This suggests that people that want bitcoin to go to the moon, so it is adopted globally, fundamentally misunderstand the nature of money.  Money that is expected to dramatically rise in value, will not be circulated because the markets will hoard it.
@_date: 2016-06-11 07:21:54

I don't think you are describing a phenomenon that every really happened. You have said people "preferred" gold (coins), and then they ran out of there currency money, and then they started to circulate gold.
I think you think that we preferred gold because it was shiny, how did people learn to mine and hoard gold?  Why did they learn to prefer it?  Where was its value before it was accepted as money?

And now we have shown their argument to be invalid.  They believe that price might rise in order for bitcoin to be mass adopted as a circulated currency.  This is why the block size cap must be raised NOW in their opinion. 
They believe that circulation increases bitcoins price.  But this is irrational. 
And what is it that will cause bitcoin's price to plateau when the supply is being chocked and there is a declining supply on the market?  
There is nothing to support these claims and they don't fit together as a coherent argument.  And their argument flied in the face of basic accepted economic principles.

 &gt;And yet Bitcoin as coffee money or e-cash is exactly how we got here today. 8 years on, and barring recent "developments" such as full blocks and a "fee market", and Bitcoin has been exactly what you deride - coffee money and e-cash.
No it hasn't.  It has had the help of speculation (wild), and also the factor which I describe and you are clearly unaware.  You have also taken me out of context.  Bitcoin as a coffee money solves no useful problem...that we got here using bitcoin to buy coffee does not speak to my point.  Nothing useful has been solved and we are still debating the nature of bitcoin and therefore the solution it provides. 
I maintain, constructing a coffee money is an insane solution to an insane problem.


Our cash is not secure as it is devalued by our governments and confiscated and thus not at all secure for the purpose we use it.  That you would call me ludicrous while I am blatantly correct is telling. We have been horrible at such security and this is the whole purpose and thesis of Szabo's writings to show this.  Everyone knows Szabo's writings are the PROPER introduction to bitcoin.


I am not ignoring it, you simply have no idea what I am talking about.  Gold as we use it today serves a purpose, it is an inflation hedge, and for that reason that we value it, it cannot also be a money.  You are conflating definitions, time, and reality when you are comparing my point to a time in which gold was able to function as a money.  The ENTIRE purpose papers like Szabo's, Hayek's, and Smith's, were written in regard to observations of the history of money is to meticulously explain this.
The RELEVANT and SIGNIFICANT perspective is that gold cannot be a cash, to change perspectives and call me dumb is to be purposefully ignorant.


It's absolutely not true and in fact John Nash's a world renown mathematician gave an incredibly in-depth argument about how you are exactly wrong, and he gives the explicate reasoning as to how gold could be targeted.  You have made guesses here and you are wrong and your argument is unfounded.


Absolutely an unfounded argument that has no grounding in any accepted science.  You have done nothing but disagree and call my ludicrous yet everything I say is just a paraphrasing of Nash's works as an extension of Smith's which runs parallel to Szabo's (which is an extension of Hayek's which Nash admits his works runs parallel to.
You have no idea what you are talking about, and what you are saying and suggesting is fucking stupid.

I am not talking about the things bitcoin provides as either gold or a coffee money, I am speaking to those that want to value the latter.  Arranging bitcoin to evolve as a coffee money serves no useful purpose.  It is not a unique quality of it, and the world is not looking for a designed money.  I realize you can't understand what I am saying, but many here do.


You are speaking nothing of its usefulness in regard to scaling it to be a coffee money opposed to a gold.


Its not conflation, especially not in any derogatory sense.  We use money because it stores value and transfers it.  When money's value is arbitrarily degraded it loses its purpose.  In regard to security, this needs to be guarded.
Call me disingenuous again.


No you have no idea because you have never been introduced to the intelligent argument and you are arguing vs strawman points.  Look at this:


You argue your own self in the same sentence! Everyone else is talking about "money" in the form of something highly transact-able. You are conflating that definition with a pegging system. Its not the same comparison is it?  Right?


I don't know if I accused you of such attacks but I called you dumb and I think you are dumb and I think it is relevant and useful to point it out.


Yes my argument comes from books I've read on great men that spent their entire lives debunking myths that you are perpetuating.  That you are too ignorant to even consider traversing their works does not at all delegitimize my points.  Furthermore I clearly don't care to convince you but am quite happy others can read me refute you.


Yes and I am quote the scientifically founded arguments that show that it can, and those arguments suggest you don't know what you are talking about and that you are not familiar with them.

Why are you counting hoarding, which by definition needs ZERO transactions per years, with 3 TRANSACTIONS and 100 TPS?  
Why do 1 billion people need to hoard bitcoin?  Do you think 1 billion people hoard gold?  
The ENTIRE point, is transactional scarcity, will render bitcoin GOLD.
You can stop asking me now, how people are going to transact, with something that they will not transact.  You are being SILLY.


Yes and by that definition the more people hoard the less they are transacting.  Or in other words the less they circulate the more they are hoarding.  Or the less transactions they are making the more they are hoarding.
There isn't really anything confusing here is there, but you don't like the conclusion.  Bitcoin isn't a world currency, its a gold.
And transactional scarcity is a VERY important component (to be clear I am saying LESS TPS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN'S PRICE) of rendering bitcoin to be a gold.
You can stop complaining to me that we won't be able to circulate it.  Circulating != hoarding.

3) I might point out that there is the possibility of ruining bitcoin's price as well, in contrast to your suggestion that it might not be optimized.  Today we have a value, can we risk destroying it in the name of TRYING to optimize it?
Here is the thing.  In order to convince Core to pass proposals etc. that wildly change bitcoin's implied (future) us, you are going to need an argument that is well grounded in science.

Your points are not relevant to the thought experiment, or in other words you are giving examples where bitcoin is not destined to continually rise in value.

That's different than your scenarios. 
The context here is that the big-blockers rely on a specific pretext that bitcoin must continually rise in value to be adopted as a global currency, but I point out this is not a rational argument, because, and this is plain and clear, a currency destined to rise in value does not get circulated.

You twist my argument to fit your conclusion.  I said no such thing, and I urge you to quote me next time.  I said nobody will spend a deflationary currency given the option of an inflationary counter part.  And like I said, this is common sense, scientifically accepted, based on historical data, and observable reality.


People get paid in fiat, merchants accept only fiat, and governments only accept fiat for taxes.  You are talking about a world that doesn't exist, and I am referring to realty.  Rational people will part with their fiat and they will save their bitcoins.  This phenomenon precludes bitcoin from being a globally circulation, mass adopted currency in the sense I describe.


Yes but you are left without a scientific basis to change the block size. and furthermore your want to do so is an irrational means to an irrational ends.  Bitcoin is far better for the world as a hoarded gold because then it will bring our global financial system in order.  You should not want bitcoin to be this or that.  You should want the world to bring about Ideal Money, where "ideal" is defined by a currency that does not degrade in value over time.  If you raise the tps to try to make bitcoin more adopted, you will kill the quality of it, and destroy the price.
@_date: 2016-06-09 05:08:20
You have changed the goal posts and not addressed what I said.  You have said eventually people will believe bitcoin's rise is finished.  You have said SOME people will need to spend now, or soon, or they will want to.
This does not address my point.  This does not address the specific picture I am calling awareness too.  
IF...the markets believe that bitcoin is destined to continually raise in value, they will circulate other currencies and hodl bitcoin.

Yes Szabo designed this for that purpose: 
Nash is different, from the nashian view have a universal unit for measurement that stands for all time.  Somewhere in your paragraph to of course is the reason and purpose money exists in the first place, to solve the difficult problem of the valuation of commodities (but also of course the distribution which is related to "who we are sending to and why").
Labor theory of value, I think becomes relevant when you can properly valuate each persons contribution.  I haven't studied this much, and I am going by past sentiments from when I skimmed some Marxian stuff.  But the idea is that in and Ideal world, we get paid the most for the endeavors that we take which help the world the most. And so if we can make this idealistic assumptions, coupled with this theoretical notion of a universal unit or measure, I think the Marxian perspective can be shown to have relationship to any competing paradigm or view. 
I'm not sure if I have said enough here to re-solve this.  I just remember when I read some Marx "facts" I all of a sudden understood his perspective, and it become consistent with contrary views once ideal money was invoked.

Ideal Money.  But you don't need to, you already have it.  The writing is useful, because it resolves views.  But the reason the differing views exist is because we aren't using ideal money.
So for example, re-think your article, but pretend (somehow) we DO have a basis for value.  We can all it a "nash", 1 unit of value.
Then you can say things like doing X raises the value of bitcoin by some non-zero amount of nashes.

No its not, you are conflating multiple definitions of money. Gold is money, and it is not easy to transact.  It is costly and difficult to move long distances.  Yet it is valueable and not at all useless (perfect as an inflation hedge). 
You are talking about a money in the definition of something people transact with with, something people circulate, and if bitcoin continues to rise then rational people will circulate it less and less and they will hoard it like gold.

yes, money effectively is synonymous with "stuff" we want because we can use money to get that stuff.  What we want to do is make it so that the way for people to get money is to benefit society and what peoples impulse to do, is to procure that money (by benefiting society).  So we can create a self optimizing process.

No. Its science.

u/evoorhees you silly cat, Gresham's Law applies only to legal tender laws like Newtons Law Applies only to Apples.  People will hoard money that they consider more valueable and spend money they consider to be losing value.  You are a buffoon for trying to argue something to fundamentally true.

They are the players that strive to base their actions on logic.  You can convince them if you are being reasonable. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:52:40


No it isn't an assumption, it is scientific fact based on historical data.  It is also common and rational sense, as well as an observable phenomenon in our current global financial system.


This is common sense, and if you have been hoarding bad money, and getting rid of your good money then you are clearly doing it wrong.


Of course it makes sense and it is the exact premise I made my argument on.


No it isn't, it is likely to continue to rise in value vs its inflationary counter parts because logic and reason suggest that deflationary currencies will be hoarded and inflationary currencies will be circulated.  I also, in my papers quote the US congressional report that explains the exact same phenomenon. 


Nothing gains value from people parting with it.  There is no scientific argument to back what you are saying, and it is in fact your misunderstanding of the nature of money.
You have publicly stated that as bitcoin rises in value you are advising people to spend it.  You are an irrational player.
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:10:58
I don't think me and you are so much in conflict.  I speak against the mob of big blockers that want to scale indefinitely, ignoring security concerns, in order to make bitcoin widely circulating world currency thus (allegedly) bringing with it the price to the moon.
 
I am not against other solutions either.  I am against continually trying to scale the block-size (debate) in order to facilitate a coffee money.  This damages the value of bitcoin in the Gresham/Nashian sense.  It is not good for a money.
@_date: 2016-06-11 05:33:22
Well I will try to be succinct but there is so much here I think is significant but it also requires a dramatic paradigm shift. I don't think our consciousness is so easily able to adapt to the conception.  One important point is that Nash wishes to remove the role of the pardoners.  This is related to the want to devalue a currency to make up for trade deficiency (not sure if I said that right).  Devaluing a currency is seen and said to be helpful domestically and in the shorterm.  But this is only a Keyenesian view, the reality is that this “equilibrium” that we are caught in (Keynesian game-play) IS an equilibrium but that is not to say it is the IDEAL/OPTIMAL equilibrium. 
The constant and otherwise (ie from an external/foreign nation's viewpoints) arbitrary devaluation of the domestic currency symbolizes an instability in our money systems (ie what are we devaluing vs?).   This instability (of this kind) creates an inability for us to create/levate a bearing point that we don't know doesn't exist for us (yet!).
This bearing point is a measure of value OVER TIME.  It is a very special thing for me to say, because it is essentially a new vector of stability, which gives us access to an indescribable amount of new technology and societal advance.
On the other hand, today and historically, when certain pressures build, be it, opec, the greek/euro crisis, the block-size debate, there is simply a creation of power in which different paradigms of “grand pardoners” hold an amount of power that creates instability (their incentive is great to use the power for selfish gain).
We are looking for stability and the kind Nash describes which is the ceiling of quality for money, is a metric for comparison that is not corruptible for all time.  I know it sounds like a myth, but I know what he proposes very well. The ceiling for the quality of money is a better unit than any other measurement we have.
When this happens one might suggest then that governments cannot devalue their currency to serve their peoples economic needs, but ultimately we will find that Nash's comparison of Keynesian to bolshevik communism to ring very true.
We don't want them to do this, its VERY bad.  It is the cause of our economic suffering.
We were taught as Nash says “Bad money is good money”
If you understand me at all, and you believe me that Nash came up with Ideal Money in the 60's you might understand his story better.

Its not in vain.  I don't understand how we don't see this.  Nash provided us with an objective basis for value.  Someone just needs to read his work.
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:55:08
I only mean to appeal to reasonable people. No time for trolls.  Its clear by the price and adoption that bitcoin is not broken, and working exactly how it was designed.  We have already seen a ton of empirical evidence that there is no correlation in regard to the claim that backlogs kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:39:41
It is only now that we have empirical data that Nash's words and works can be made sense of.  In the paper this article refers to bitcoin is compared with different currency/equity markets in regard to the stability of there value. 
What are they doing?  
They are trying to create a basis for the evaluation of stability. 
They thinking in the direction of what Nash termed an ICPI.  
The ICPI is theoretical, it points to what COULD be used to represent perfectly stable value, which is a perfectly chosen basket of commodity prices.
The paper in this article is literally Nash's thesis, that after some evolution in regard to price stability, our PSYCHOLOGY would change.

@_date: 2017-01-20 22:02:42
It needs to be free from factions, that are trying to idealize it as a currency.  There is no such thing as a useful money in that sense.  You cannot design a currency to be valueable with forethought.  But if you design it so it cannot be changed...then it can function like gold...which albeit has drawbacks in regard to being an ideal money....but it will bring about REAL ideal money.
People says they want bitcoin to be an ideal money but thats a silly thing to say.  Sounds backwards doesn't it?  That's why nobody has read and understood Nash's works.  It's psychologically difficult to wrap your head around.
EVERYONE thinks you can just raise bitcoins blocksizse and then it will be more ideal.  Nash was clever, 20 years before bitcoin existed, he already posed the counter argument to such ignorance.  
THIS is why bitcoin core is so difficult to over throw...Satoshi was clever too.  They are guarding bitcoin's quality as a gold, which means there is zero pressure or incentive to scale the block size for transaction capacity.  Transaction capacity is not a quality of gold.

Sort of, there is a chicken/egg issue here i have with this.  At times we needed multiple currencies for other reasons, and at times not so much. Basically I am cautioning that, for example, if one empire decided it would be best to have one currency, and so they tried to wipe out all currencies through various acts and levels of warfare, this wouldn't really bring about favorable change.
So you might be right, but we have to be careful about how we would apply the truth of what you suggest.

I don't think China has any incentive to put "capital control" restriction on bitcoin. If we think of bitcoin as a gold 2.0 which retains its value in respect to an optimally chosen basket of commodities, and relative to other fiat currencies, then China should be quite happy that its citizens are holding more and more bitcoin in relation to the citizens of other nations.
Although the process of devaluation ultimately hurts their own citizens (and the world citizens), it is not actually the goal of the government.  The goal is in relation to a currency war with among other factors and entities the USD.
People are suggest that bitcoin allows for more capital flight, but there is no better option for their people (what would you exchange bitcoin for as an inflation hedge to the yuan?!).

Thanks, its important to me to here at least some encouragement.  I know I myself have been called crazy very very often by many many different types of people.  I know its just the internet but its daunting and especially disheartening to think of what he went through to bestow this insight on us.
Why no one is talking about it is interesting.  I would like a conspiracy, but there is the point that Nash is just too far ahead in his thinking, and that coupled with the fact that the nature of money and our relationship is such that we really really don't understand it and have a sort of cognitive bias towards proper discussion of it.

Yes, this level of sincerity I can appreciate.
I have said, given the option between good or bad money, people will circulate the bad, and they will not circulate the good.
This is a relevant, and scientifically valid, explanation of gresham's law.  Do not conflate what I say, with what you worry I am implying, or you will miss how INCREDIBLY rational I am. I say things like "money that goes up in price is more valueable, and money that goes does in price is less valuable". I say simple truths that can't reasonably be argued with.


You bold choose, but do you realize you don't mean what you are asking?  People can still CHOOSE, but you are upset because you do not like the choice, that circulating will become expensive.  The option is still there, but you don't like it.  But you are disingenuous to act as if I am suggesting we are taking away the freedom to choose. I have not said or suggested or implied that.


Firstly ANY such change to bitcoin will destroy the price, furthermore even the debate about such change will destroy it.  Smaller blocks or bigger blocks will destroy it.  This is because you give the markets the perception that the future of bitcoin is in limbo.  This is why I advocate NO CHANGE, and why 1mb is a perfectly find number even if it is in fact arbitrary.
Furthermore, when you say "people would look for alternatives" you are talking about a medium for circulation.  If people want bitcoin for hoarding, and you drop the tps to 1, then why would hoarding seek a different currency to hoard with?


Yes but now your argument hinges on a fringe amount of people spending an amount of bitcoin that grows less and less over time.  That is to say, even if someone has 100% in bitcoin, lets say they spend $100 usd per day in bitcoin, as bitcoin price increase in regard to usd, that person only needs to spend less and less bitcoin to still buy $100 of things per day.
So you see what I present is perfectly rational.  You are learning that you haven't heard a rational player speak in this industry. Andreas Voorhees etc. do not understand how money works.


Its absolutely possible, however you cannot build a world currency off bitcoin while the majority of people are hoarding it.  I am talking about reality, not some hypothetical world in the future that skips how we will get from A to B.
You are pointing at B and saying "see see see there it is, its real' and I am telling you that be is a hypothetical end and there is not scientific basis to show there is a path to get from A to B.
Bitcoin cannot be a world currency because rational players are hoarding it.  This is also why there are no major merchants.  Have you ever asked yourself why all the big business don't accept bitcoin? Why merchant adoption is flopping and flailing?  Bitcoin is not a currency that rational people want to circulate. We can observe this.

This doesn't really speak to the reality or the problem though, because it is people that are claiming bitcoin should be a money that you are suggesting are simultaneously trying to get rich from it.
So they are calling for two opposites at the same time, and there is no sense to it.
Not that you aren't pointing this out, but its irrationality at its root rather than greed.  Greed might play a role in the irrationality, but greed SHOULD lead everyone to want bitcoin to be gold NOT money.
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:57:32
bitcoin as a gold fits perfectly into Nash's insights in a very meaningful way.  But the goldness of it is something specific he outlines very carefully.  He points out gold isn't scarce so much but has an increased cost for digging deeper.  In this sense, and the sense that nash proposes something like gold but not gold, bitcoin is favorable in every sense, and beats gold where it is weak (which Nash also goes over in detail.
Bitcoin does much more than gold, but its most important use is if it can bring our fiat currencies into stable order...not to overtake them, but to align them in regard to their stability of value.
Cheers and I do have an appreciation that people come to similar conclusion when thinking only or mostly about the security of bitcoin.

You are ignoring the problem that the citizens are trying to solve.  Their money is being devalued and they need a savings/hedge to stop the bleed of their equity.  So they are doing anything they can to find a reasonable investment, which leads them off-shore (this is all my understanding).
Bitcoin is crushing the USD, what are you suggest they are going to trade their bitcoin for?

In regard to "Limitations on Recording, Storing, Analysis, and Playback in the Brain" I think we might begin to explore the process of changing ones base building blocks or metaphors. There is a pitfall here that the metaphors themselves cannot be used for change because to do so would effectively re-enforce their existence.
This is the paradoxical difficultly and I think we can surpass it logically and that this is exactly what Krishnamurti and Bohm meant to show that we are capable of, and exactly how we might do so.
The intrinsic difficulty is that we are going to naturally want to use methods that inherit the problem of subjectivity. This is akin to trying to centrally plan that which cannot be centrally planned (aka Hayek's “Fatal Conceit”).
I think then it would be helpful, as an inductive mathematical type proof, to levate the concept of an AI that doesn't have the same functioning memory centers as we do. Or in other words we want to explore the possibility of an AI that doesn't "fully" store a memory of experiences for recall and decision making, but rather compartmentalizes each experience into its most useful lesson/form and lets the actually broader memory of the event fade.
(Here I want to make a point about the importance of having a proper relationship to propriety and in regard to DNA, but I want to make sure when I make this certain point its quite scientifically acceptable.)
Here then we are thinking of the possibility that such a machine could never develop PTSD that a human with an experience they cannot resolve could (with the assumption that a machine is able to compartmentalize the experience and understand it well enough to extract “lessons”).
This machine could then effectively wipe any memory it had, or as another analogy, it could flash its own ROM, which would then be somewhat comparable to a humans core beliefs.
The difference here being that an AI wouldn't have the same reservations about changing it's own core beliefs and thus could function more efficiently in regard to self-upgrades.
There is a theoretically “blinding” speed here, that the AI would have to observe analyze process, record, compress/translate, and “flash” its ROM, all somewhat near instantaneously. But it's at least asymptotically achievable as technology (and especially theoretically which might be enough for insight).
So then I think we can also ask if the brain could possibly function this way, the human brain. Can the brain function without worshiping memory of the past or projection of future at all?
Can the mind change its “beliefs” and its processes, so that the memory processes take on a whole new meaning?
Can this use of the mind be practiced, learned, philosophized about?
What is the effect on the brain, and the basic building blocks and metaphors it uses, and the synapses and neural pathways, when the mind no longer functions in regard to psychological time?

@_date: 2017-01-16 16:36:24
I like this, does it come from somewhere/someone, or what do you attribute the insight to? Here are the relevant and significant points to what I want us to understand:
 &gt;Put simply, the value of a nation could be described as $1 per person + fair value of current assets, if all peoples were similarly productive, and technology was stagnant.
This makes sense but of course it doesn't make sense to say $1 because '$1' has an arbitrary and ambiguous meaning.  We need to admit this not skip over it, and we need the community to understand what we are saying.
 &gt;Each nation must have 'something' in place to establish a valuation, translated into a common unit of measure, accepted on the global scale.
Each nation DOES have something in place, which its its fiat system, which is generally targeted at some inflation.  The problem is that the metric is not universally or especially global.  So to be more specific we need a universal metric.


This is a mistake to say.  Bitcoin as a proper or ideal store of value would be a great unit of measure (of value).  But it cannot be ideal, it can be good though, bitcoin is a good store of a value and a decent unit of measure.  The problem of society is we need an IDEAL metric for value. Also remember it is value we are wanting to accurately measure.


This is more correct to say '1 unit of measure' but we should say '1 unit of value' and this unit is called a "nash"










These steps, although correct in their own context, do not address the problem of the world which is 'how to get the nations to play ball to create a single incorruptible unit of value'. 1) speaks perfect truth and is the new axiom that Nash proposes which is that central banks should print money of stable quality.  2) It needn't be 1 unit, but what you are suggesting is that ideally in the future each citizen adds an equal value to society which implies the assumption that we are maximizing each humans potential (otherwise how is their addition to society equal?  3) This is agreeable too but it needs to come with the caveat that we cannot precalculate what is appropriate so there is a difficulty here that needs to be stated-it means to precalcuate such a number for a society implies a tyrannical calculator.  4) also really only happens by natural evolution and not foresight
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:14:58
There are two aspect about this that are irrational and need to be highlighted:


If there is less power to adjust interest rates, inflation, etc to dampen out swings in the economy, we may see more volatility in the overall economy.
It cannot be said that there are to be boom and bust cycles as a con when the pro is controlling your own wealth.  
This is true for this point as well:
Digital currencies still fluctuate in value much more than government currencies. While this can be a good thing for investors speculating on the price, it means that people using it as a currency can still lose wealth. Luckily, digital currencies have also gotten less volatile each year for the past four years. For the first time in 2016, bitcoin became less volatile than some government issued currencies, like the Venezuelan bolivar. I’d expect this trend to continue.
I realize he's trying to paint a balanced perspective, but it uses two conflicting schools of thought that show to be irrational when put side by side.  
It can't be a pro that bitcoin is secure from inflation and then a con that it is volatile.

You are saying '$1' which in today's common terms means 1 usd.  This is meaningless in regard to your essay because it has no underlying definition of value.
If you mean to say 1 unit of a given nations' respective fiat, then you have the problem we have today, which is that each nation refuses to keep their unit stable in relation to other nations.  
Nash proposes a stable unit of value, and I propose it is called a Nash.

Yes but the '$' is generally used to mean something else so you can't use it for that.
Nash's proposal for stability is in regard to an optimally chosen basket of global commodity prices, so its a little bigger than domestic.


It's not easy and so far it has been next to impossible and it is not accepted that bitcoin is stable.  In regard to your point here it is meaningless (and not possible) to have a stable currency but also one that is not viable in the markets.  These are inseparable.


We should mean to say, that the world will adopt and international standard for value and all currencies will be based in relation to it. It's not quite the same as what you are saying ;)

Absolutely not.  Firstly Calling Ver out for the malicious intent he clearly has is absolutely NOT name calling, its observing reality. Secondly, my argument hasn't been heard and it makes you look like a fool. You don't know what you are talking about and the Ver brigade absolutely DOES NOT have the same interests.  They are trying to scale a money to be valuable and useful and that is absolutely insanity. There is nothing founded about their argument and trying to resolve the debate by legitimizing a view from a person that has never read a single book on economics is absolutely the most damaging thing you can do right now, especially while implying that you have any authority on the subject whatsoever.

It is only now that we have empirical data that Nash's words and works can be made sense of. In the paper this article refers to bitcoin is compared with different currency/equity markets in regard to the stability of there value.
What are they doing?
They are trying to create a basis for the evaluation of stability.
They thinking in the direction of what Nash termed an ICPI.
The ICPI is theoretical, it points to what COULD be used to represent perfectly stable value, which is a perfectly chosen basket of commodity prices.
The paper in this article is literally Nash's thesis, that after some evolution in regard to price stability, our PSYCHOLOGY would change.

I don't yet fully understand the entire system, and maybe not at all, but it seems to me that it is purposefully designed so that someone like the Ver brigade can't come in with a sweeping change that destroys the integrity of the system.
Those complaining that core is a central authority holding back bitcoin from evolving, don't understand the purpose of the electoral college etc.
They fight against their own best interests and freedoms.

No, in this cause Eric discredited them.  I am using a word "keynesian" that has a definition that is "those that want to perpetually devalue a currency".  Eric has shown that the big blocker argument does exactly that.  This means the big blocker argument is perfectly comparable to what Nash calls Keynesians.  And this makes Ideal Money perfectly relevant.
Not at all a strawman, rather an incredibly solid argument.

@_date: 2016-11-28 23:43:27
Not everyone can agree with this but from my perspective bitcoin gains another order of stability when enough pools grow enough competing ideologies (and that those pools evolve to be secure in their own rights). The complexity needed probably can't be well or specifically described, but we can say if they are not in a decentralized equilibrium then it cannot be known that bitcoin is secure from faction.
The conflict is a necessity, much more so than a scaling solution. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:01:31

there is no reason to allow an ignorant mob to overrule reason.  That you would call for it is telling of your intellect. Furthermore and more to the point, bitcoin is secure vs. faction, that is why the debate is a red herring, /rbtc can never win, its just really really annoying.

You've assumed bitcoin's greatest utility is as a money.  Szabo did in fact write articles about future technology that would dissolve gold's perceived scarcity. 
Satoshi had to decide initial parameters and what could and should be changed and what can't be. There realization becomes a trade off.  You cannot parameterize ideal money for all time.  It would have to be adjusted.  But opening such a thing for adjustment is a security leak and thus would limit the value that could be stored and significance of the role that could be played. 
You don't understand this trade off and you join all the other pitchforkers crying out about something which you don't understand the limits of.

yup its going to be a narrow audience until the argument is organized more and compressed.  But also until its written about it by better writers who have different and bigger followings.  And yes you understand it well enough.  Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly, as if he was purposefully leaving it out.
But it needs to have the quality of gold (in the nashian sense), in order that it becomes the beacon for stability in the markets.  It can't be messed with.  That has to be the priority.
Many people want bitcoin to serve all their needs, but that is to not understand Nash's proposal.  When we all read and understand Nash's argument we will want to make bitcoin a "good money" so that it causes our legacy systems to idealize in response.

If you don't accept the premise then the news might not seem obviously fake to you.  
Given its obviously fake, I see a nature conjecture that it is the flow of money that is creating the phenomenon.  I am suggesting this is sort of the occram's razor choice rather than a conspiracy.
If money flowing into the media sites is from a certain side of the political debate, that would show in the content.

I think then it might soon hit you in a flash what hit me.  Well you haven't traversed the entire works ideal money, but Nash's has already extended this line of thinking based on the introduction of bitcoin as a digital gold (without saying or knowing of bitcoin because he publicly proposed Ideal Money first in 1995.
Nash is in incredibly exhaustive on this subject in relation to the history and then present circumstances of money, and he builds up the reason and argument for how ideal money can and will come about.  Here is are some significant clips that will glow to you I think: 
This means that as our global money systems begin to self optimize we will turn towards dialogue and turn our dialogue towards the levation of "Ideal Money".
This will point to Nash, who as a young many in his 20's/30's first came up with the concept of "Ideal Money" and was caught gibberishing about how all the governments collude against the people and he was going to liberate them (whilst fleeing to europe to exchange his usd for the swiss franc only to be taken back to the US by the Navy).
@_date: 2016-06-09 03:32:31
It doesn't matter how far in the future you are looking.  Bitcoin will not be circulated if the price is expected to continually climbs.  It is irrational to think it will. Merchants might accept the tiny amounts of bitcoin that irrational actors or "super rich" would part with, but even those merchants themselves would not dare part with their coins.
Tickle down economy is a lie that was sold to the people, it has not bearing in reality, and you cannot create a world currency like this, when so many other currencies will have a high velocity in relation to bitcoin.
All you have down, is create a long paragraph that says people will hold and circulate at the same time, and that is intellectually absurd to consider.
You have a conclusion, it does not fit accepted science, so you twist reality to suit your conclusion.

Perhaps I should recognize your user name more, but your words here stick out very far in comparison with most others here. It's very hard to find others with your points here.
So you must be a proponent of ideal money, in the Nashian sense, and if you are not then you should know that your general point here is his thesis which is perfectly summarized in his opening paragraphs. 
He explains the Keynesian psychology is to sell to the people that bad money is good.
Regardless I would also want to ask you, how you feel that all of the media, mainstream or indie, has picked up the Keynesian side of the a fake debate as a part of a "balanced" narrative?  How does this insanity spread so high and so far?
I think Nash would/has argue(d) that the psychology is related to the money systems themselves.  So as bitcoin evolves so with the general sentiments of the players in the community.
It's partially from that understanding, it occurs to me, that Ver has probably been at least somewhat controlling the media's narrative on bitcoin-and some other, even big players, have simple been allowing him to do that, and fostering his efforts.  Big players that don't have sincere interests of the world.

I have used a specific definition of Gresham's law. This definition is in regard to the actual creation of the law and how it came to be understood and known. It is backed by the history of the law, and the Nashian insight into it.
You are taking a different definition, and using it to show irrelevance. Please understand what I mean to say in this post.  I need to compartmentalize my argument, "Gresham's law" (the word/phrase) is a shell, that I use to encapsulate a specific understanding.  
In this regard, Gresham's law explains that people will circulate money that is consistently being devalued and they will hoard money that is increasing in quality/value.  
It is a very reasonable definition, and very related to Gresham's law, only not in the way you understand Gresham's law.  It is scientific of me to suggest this phenomenon as we can note it is observable in reality today.
Our governments devalue our currency's so that we spend them.
If we want we can call this "pokertravis's" law, but regardless of the name it is a basic and fundamental economic truth in regard to the nature of money.
If I can be allowed to put that definition in place, I believe you will find great strength and relevance in my argument.
Thank you for your time.

Ver has never read a book on economics.  He is trying to solve the problem of "how to make bitcoin a world currency" which is a dull and petty problem which has no useful solution.  The problem to solve is how to bring our world money systems into order to create stability.  We want to ask "can bitcoin be arranged to do this?"
Ver has framed his understanding into a debate, that is all that has happened.  There is no intelligent argument but these radio shows that keep giving a mic to someone with zero knowledge on the subject and a huge politically based opinion.
And I'm not watching this and no one else will.  A talk designed to rustle feathers, and get a twitter audience but to deliver ZERO substance.

Pure democracy doesn't protect us against an ignorant mass rising up and voting the minority or themselves to have less freedom.

He couldn't be more of a hypocrite and by his argument we should NOT be hard-forking the software because its not tested, has no legacy, and will break the software code and therefore break bitcoin.
He isn't even listening to himself... and for trying to ban the most valuable contributor and the opposing view to his view...and for banning other's that don't agree with his view...by his OWN ADMISSION AND DEFINITIONS...he should not be trusted to maintain bitcoin.

Yes John Blocke did.


There is no evidence that adding users adds value to the network.  Staying "its supply and demand" doesn't not support such an argument.

This rhetoric is driving me nuts and maybe I need to leave the internet.  There is no definition or division of when we have no other alternative when the community doesn't agree on a goal in the first.

We there is no useful way probably.  But gold for example could be more or less stable depending on the discoveries of it for example.  Now if we take a different array commodities that are generally stable, or are the most stable in value that we have access to....the aggregate might create 'the most stable' metric we have...
Such a practice would tend towards optimal...
This might not help us tangibly, but it does show that there is some limit towards what could be understood to be, or relied upon as stable, or optimally stable etc.

yup i meant that.  bitcoin being limited in transactions makes it comparable to gold.  Even though its different, because (whereas) gold is cumbersome to transport (which implies a sort of friction as a money).
You are smart enough to recognize the significance of a new "thing" that can play the role of gold in our society and it is not as a coffee money-gold isn't valuable because you can make cheap purchases with it!

Sure.  And whatever.  But you are implying this means bitcoin was not intended (and intended not) to evolve as a settlement layer, and you have not shown that in your quotations and bolding.

This is actually what I am accusing of each and every one of you in this discussion of doing. But I don't think you will initially realize how literally I am speaking. 
Nash already had this debate with himself over the last 20 years in regard to the advent of an electronic currency with a stably issued supply (even down to the asymptotically halving inflation rate) with a series of lectures and writings under the title Ideal Money.. 
You are only ignoring him because you think he (and me) is crazy. And you spent 2 hours interviewing and wasting your time on a nefarious moron. 
NONE OF YOU even know what the problem is you are trying to solve, and none of you understand what you are talking about in regard to optimizing bitcoin.﻿

u/theymos the forum is growing useless imo but under the disguise that it is being used. Do we want these posts reported, or we will just put up with the spam?  I think we should have a polls on whether big block debate should be allowed at all, or at least put into a single thread.
Yesterday I had a thread/OP I created about this topice rise quite high.  This is despite my anti big blocker threads and posts often being obviously targeted by the Ver Brigade.  So there seems to be some legit support of this view.

No it won't because everyone doesn't transact with every user in the network.

No this is not what we do with graphs, we do not look at them curiously and decide if they prove causation.
I am speaking to this:


I gave an example of other factors that are involved in the valuation of bitcoin, which is not solely the addition of users, nor does the addition of users have a quadratic effect on the price.
Metcalfe's law does not imply that or prove it or state it .

Your point is silly though getting your news source from an ignorance brigade is not going to help you.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:44:57


I call this even "re-solution".


Money arose as an accidental yet naturally occurring solution to the problem of society.  Now that is still in a "frame" but its a fairly agreeable frame.  There can be good money and bad money and we should want to "idealize" it, because having ideal money, money stable over a long period of time, solves many social problems.  
It is my suggestion that bitcoin as a settlement system, or that is not primarily scaled with transaction capacity as a priority, will serve as the catalyst/stage for ideal money to be brought about.  
This leads me to suggest that bitcoin as a digital gold is valueable but bitcoin as a coffee money is not.
And back to our thought experiment, if bitcoin only did what fiat did, there would be no value in it.  Bitcoin's value comes from its innovation/efficiency it provides. I don't know if i can watch this video.

And now you come to the full circle of changing definitions so the word expert means the complete opposite of its true meaning. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:56:24


No. The reason r/btc was created is because the modding policies here are such that we don't allow idiots, trolls, and spams like your post I am quoting above (which is carefully crafted to try and get around the filter rules). 


You are the 2nd poster in a very short time I have caught, as a staunch Ver supporter, calling someone disingenuous while SIMULTANEOUSLY acting as a perfect definition of the word.  
To be clear for everyone here is the definition of disingenuous:


You are not using the word correctly and that in itself (since you COULD look up the definition yourself) not to mention your drivel or a text show that you are not only a perfect example of the word, but you are a clear designed troll.


How is a hard fork dangerous?  You say everything you said, but you are so incompetent you can't state any risks of a hard fork?


Why is your argument pure buzz phrases.  When someone speaks to the general community consensus and especially refers to the majority of experts in a field, you have no re-course in regard to defeating their argument with buzz words.  You are simply thinking you are cleverly derailing their otherwise useful points.  You are derailing and changing goal posts, not engaging sincerely and this is another perfect definition of the word disingenuous.


Everyone knows it is risky which is why the debate exists, denying the obvious reality of the situation is disingenuous.


No but its rational to point out, especially between two people who aren't the experts.  Put another way, you are too stupid to understand or know what you are discussing.


No it isn't.  Only the ignorant players thought this.  You're argument henceforth is a logical fallacy.

@_date: 2016-12-20 17:45:34
The suggestion is that price/value grows exponentially with the addition of each node.  This is obviously silly because adding a node is only adding ROOM for growth, it doesn't mean that you can grow bitcoin's value simply by growing the network.

Last time I checked, it wasn't an unreasonable expectation to use "cash" to buy coffee.
You are implying that Satoshi implied bitcoin was cash and THEREFORE Satoshi meant bitcoin to scale to be a coffee money. 
There is NO SUBSTANCE to your argument, and its not grounded in science nor acceptable by the standards of academia (ie you understand the purpose and implication of the whitepaper wrong).
The whitepaper is intended to be politically neutral its part of the fundamental purpose of it.

But you haven't spoken to where that self consistency in gold comes from. 1 fiat is one fiat, but you imply its not because the value degrades.  Why does the value of gold not degrade?
Fiat can be overprinted, but so can gold. And gold is not actually as scare as most presume it to be.

We can control the effects though, of a dissenting and effectively malicious faction, by fostering enough conflicting opinion that no such faction can ever gain enough of the majority to overule the security of the already otherwise secure protocol.

When the network is being used and favored by more users with more transactions but this isn't leading to a hard fork bigger blocks (and is in fact showing that users are fine with a "congested" network) the big blocks starts to cry that the excessive use is at least partially caused by spam attack transactions.

There are people that legitimately want big blocks, but there is no want that wants big blocks and isn't ignorant.  I think they were deceived by the media sites that perpetual the irrational and unfounded argument.


It's not fake news to point out that a view is unfounded and irrational.
Check out Eric Lomborozos latest blog that shows the truth that the big blocker crowd is simply an attempt to crush the security and value of the network.

When the network is filled with transactions and the users therefore deem bitcoin useful, the big blocker is always crying that the network is congested and that eventually people will value bitcoin so much that it will become useless.  
In the big blocker argument bitcoin becomes so valued it becomes worthless.  
In regard to "congestion" how does a network that becomes increasingly "worse" become more used?

You are thinking of the wrong problem from the wrong perspective.  What we want is our governments and central banks to print money with a superior quality. But because of their nature (and human influence) the policies are always such that the money is inferior.
But with the introduction of a "good" option, this puts pressure on the fiats, and forces the keynesian players onto a new stage, a new game.
Now as fiats depreciate, the respective citizens of the countries learn about bitcoin and inflation. Naturally.
The only thing left to do would be to define what it means to say a "good" currency...that is, in what sense...?
Of course Nash means, good, in the "ideal sense", which refers to a type of stability that gold had.
From there, the extrapolations for an e-money with a stable inflation schedule can be reasoned...
You see you can't make ideal money, not by design, but you CAN make a digital gold, aka a "good" money (by the nashian standard of what is good which is money that is stable to a theoretical optimally chosen set of commodities etc.).

You are conflating things. Let me pose to you the PROPER argument.  Bitcoin, so this mythical debate goes, is to be EITHER a highly transactionable (cheap) coffee money or a digital gold. 
In this sense "digital gold" is another name for "settlement layer".
Calling it bankers talk isn't useful.  There is a meaning to the phrase that is defined in economic science.  It's not FUD because you don't understand it.  
Gold is not so easily transacted nor will bitcoin with a 1mb be "hard".  Cash doesn't transfer on the internet which is why using bitcoin is advantageous in comparison.  
Blanketing terms like "third parties" and "artificial limits" is also not helpful. Everyone is a third party and all of bitcoins limits were artificially bestowed.

That bitcoin's value is perfectly tied to it "usability" is foolish.  Bitcoin is already far more useable than gold and gold is far less useable than many of the depreciating currencies around the world.

2) you are a troll.
@_date: 2016-12-27 06:22:34








Here is what I am understanding. I am understanding that what would and should otherwise be a technical debate that benefits all of mankind (is that too dramatic or is it truth?) has been hijacked by a political agenda which effectively wants to inflate (ie destroy its value) bitcoin by destroying the fundamental mechanism behind the security of the network.
I also see that there has been some concerted effort, especially recently, by you and others, to dispel the ignorance and misinformation that is perpetuated by The Ver brigade and the big-blocker/hard-fork-at-all-costs agenda.
I think Hilary Clinton’s biggest mistake was that she isn’t a very good politician and Trump is. Hilary and Bernie played the game as if the general citizenry is above the game of politics. Trump was truly the only one playing the game. Rational arguments are obviously going to lose out to political rhetoric in such a setting of trying to dominate news and social media in regard to trying to sway the ignorant mass.
So I have suggested to you, that Nash’s works “Ideal Money” can end this political debate instantaneously upon gaining awareness among the community. And what is your opinion of that? Did you read the content of even the main 8 page paper? Or is it too crazy suggest this man gave us a very very relevant base for an argument against the Keynesian big-blocker faction?
Nash’s gives the extensive argument that shows how irrational Ver and big-blockers are, and how the problem they are trying to address (the introduction of a world coffee money) has no use for our society. Our goal should be a stable value measurement mechanism, and there is only the POSSIBILITY bitcoin could help bring this about, but bitcoin should not be assume be that “thing”. It is absurd and insanity to try to optimize bitcoin as this, and it runs backwards to evolution and causality to suggest a money could be designed to be as such.
Are you sure, Nash’s works are insignificant and irrelevant? You wouldn’t ignore it without at least skimming it right? Do we not understand him?
Can we reframe the argument, please?
Nash already defined how to levate a politically stable money…

Your argument that cash/money has such a definition that it must be “secure-able” also don’t speak to observable reality as much of our money today and in the past is NOT very secure-able, and this is the very problem of it!
You clearly have not hurt the important argument, and so you speak to the red-herring perpetuated by ignorant players.
FROM THE SIGNIFICANT AND RELEVANT PERCEPTIVE….
Bitcoin as a gold and as a (coffee) money’s are contrary states. From polar ends of the spectrum and it CANNOT be both.
You CANNOT design and forward plan a good money in the sense of the way and reason we value gold, which means if you try to do what Roger Ver and Gavin are trying to do (ie and you are successful) you will destroy Bitcoin’s value and therefore its price on the markets.
That is the RELEVANT and SIGNIFICANT point to make.
In regard to bitcoin as a settlement layer for 2nd layer solutions, like finney talks about, and Adam Smith provides great analogy for, this is bitcoin as a gold, and what functions on top is the cash…
You dont speak properly to this phenomenon however, because you are not addressing bitcoin as a gold in relation to FIAT, which is a nonsensical omission.

Nash lists a few reasons we wouldn't return to gold.  


You already envision the result painted in Ideal Money, but it isn't necessarily that bitcoin becomes the world currency. That isn't the problem he is addressing.


The comparison to such a basket of price, for Nash's proposal is for theory only, since there is no way to get by the politics (ie the politics is part of the problem)...but we can still note that stable money would be stable in relation to such an optimally choosen set of commodities.
That is to say: it is useful to note, OTHERWISE.


At the end of Ideal Money Nash makes a remark that his views are parallel with hayek.
And so should we open this dialogue, on what is ideal money, and how can it be brought about?  Because from these men's views, the big blocker campaign is social insanity.  Bitcoin cannot be rendered ideal by a policy change.

It goes further than that. u/johnblocke said this:


Metcalfe's law does not determine the price of bitcoin.  The price of bitcoin is not perfectly correlated to the user base. This is a fallacy and a misapplication of the law.

Nowhere here does it suggest, for example, that EVERYTHING mustn't be centrally planned.  There is only the danger of 'trying to achieve a goal through central-planning that cannot be achieved through central-planning'.
The first thing to ask those that suggest that the 1mb restriction is central-planning and therefore must be removed, is if the person making the suggestion has read the literature they are implicitly citing.
The 1mb restriction has nothing to do with the folly of central-planning, yet to remove it for the purpose of idealizing or optimizing bitcoin as a currency ABSOLUTELY is such a folly of central-planning.

Let me explain the argument that is put forth by these clowns.  
This is like going to disneyland and seeing thousands of people paying $100 bux per ticket, and thinking "Wow, I'm gonna create my own disneyland"..and so you go and by a super cheap property in the middle nowhere and start on your plans to build multiple disneylands because, "Well...you know...if I have 5x disneylands I'll be 5x richer".
Just because you increase the size of the network does not mean it gains value.  Otherwise we should just start dividing our bitcoin and sending it to everyone we know, and then everyone just keeps sending bitcoin to each other and we will all be Roger Ver millionaires!

I want to answer this piece by piece, but I should read it a few times and think about it.  In the meantime, after writing all this and thinking about it, can you honestly say that Nash's works Ideal Money is not relevant?  Do you see why I see the block size debate as a red herring to the TRUE important dialogue we are to have, which is whether or not bitcoin can be shaped to help bring about ideal money (with admission that it cannot be ideal itself).
Your questions are valid and perfectly on point, but more importantly, doesn't it interest you that Nash already addressed them?
Wouldn't you think that would be an impressive amount of intelligence for him to not only foresee this dialogue and debate, but to already have argued and resolve ALL sides of it?
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:57:20
its not a change in the protocol to keep it the same, but you have to twist definitions to make your perspective fit. There will be no such scaling to avoid user fees.  Bitcoin as it is will stand strong and the nature of it will change, just as it was intended to.
And its REALLY interesting you are implying blockstream is malicious and yet you are fighting my suggestion that bitcoin will curb central banks ability to enact monetary policy, and yet you WORK FOR A BIG BANK!!!!!

This is a moot point that does not speak to any argument, does not support yours, and does not contradict mine.


There is no objective measurement of value other than market valuation which is the aggregate of the public's wants.  The things you listed as measuring its value are yours and subjective.
The entire point of economics and the basis for Smith or any well respected economic philosopher or student is that market price is our objective measurement of value.

just because you can make a a chat comparing the two does not mean one is the cause of the other.  There are many factors in play and there is no scientific basis to suggest if we all just started using bitcoin then we would all be rich with bitcoin.
Bitcoin has potential to be incorruptible and we should expect that to include being incorruptible from the whims of an ignorant mass. 
 &gt;not allow the network to grow and alter its use case after billions of dollars have been poured into it
That is silly rhetoric, there is nothing to suggest bitcoin must be scaled as a coffee money, there is no value in that whatsoever, we already have many existing legacy systems that serve that purpose.

You won't getting anywhere suggesting that the sincere computer scientists and core developers have moved away from logic. The only thing that has happened is that Ver and his ignorance brigade have come in to cast doubt on what is otherwise intelligent discussion of maintaining a secure and stable bitcoin.
Suggesting that ALL sides have moved from logic based discussion is a perfect device that suits this faction. There is an implication that you are wrong, as there is obviously at least one logical view, and you are also implying you are standing at it while simultaneously making a flawed statement.

Its funny that the VER brigade always has to make a word or phrase's definition the exact opposite of convention in order for their argument to make sense.

I don't know if "censorship" implies anything more than reasonable rules.  I changed/edit it to reflect your sentiments.
Skipping a few back and forth posts, what I am really asking is whether you believe freedom of speech requires "no moderation" like r/btc, the big blocker brigade, and Ver and crew seem to heavily insist and lay their argument on.
Do you feel the great pains taken by the persons of the past to protect our free speech against the tyranny of the majority are encapsulated here:


My question seems clear to me.  If we can suppose that free speech requires SOME moderation, and such a line is incredibly significant but also complex to define, does the linked statement take such a consideration seriously or even at all?

@_date: 2016-12-20 20:30:32
We aren't talking about bitcoin nodes we are talking about users and we are referring to users as nodes because thats how we relate this to metcalfe's law.


But we would lose out on things like "not being able to use the redundant road space, materials, and construction costs, for other things"
None of this speaks to the notion of adding users to bitcoin exponentially increases its value.  That's a fallacy, and you are all trolls for continuing to try and hold up such a statement.
@_date: 2016-12-31 08:04:31
Thx theymos, the tone is perfect.  Wait until we read Ideal Money together (everyone).  Nash built an argument, and it doesn't make sense without bitcoin as the premise.  It's clear, its just hard to accept that he could have done this.
And although whoever did the code deserves real credit, I think it is going to be important for civilization to understand that bitcoin evolved.  
I'm sure that it did, I'm not sure you feel it did, maybe "Satoshi" even thinks it didn't...
But like the pyramids I think that we will come to understand bitcoin as natural evolution, and this is why nash was able to expound on it...
Mix that with Szabo, finney, and we have a technology that is going to propel is into the "future" faster than even the most educated of the subject realize.

Yes and the interesting point is that there is a ceiling to that game, in regard to the increasing quality of money, and of course that is money that is perfectly comparable to a theoretically optimal basket of commodities.
Now in regard to bitcoin do we see what Nash has done?
There are those that are arguing that we might scale bitcoin as a coffee money in order to "optimize it", but optimal in the big blocker sense is meaningless...
and furthermore, and more importantly, messing with a money in the sense of trying to idealize it, necessarily destroys its gold like property that could otherwise be used to inspire our fiats to evolve toward ideal money....
Nash has already argued and solve the block-size debate and what bitcoin SHOULD be.

thx, I felt I had a clear compressed way of presenting my insight, finally...well it certainly is clearer than when I first saw this. Just to me, its the most important thing in the world, and its difficult to watch the narrative on bitcoin completely miss a very significant proposal for a very important technology (ideal money).
And I understand your fear very well, however, it is more true to say that as our money systems idealize we will become more psychologically stable.  Our collective psychology is tied into the quality (in the Nashian sense) of our money systems. 
So it really is a full circle, to understand what it means that we call Nash crazy (I still get this when presenting to "smart" people), when he's the one that saw this all DECADES before anyone could come close to understanding what he was talking about.

My argument is you can't just add users and "usability" and imply that the price/value will grow exponentially.  We have many coffee monies and no use for another one.  We DO however have use for a secure store of value, and bitcoin doesn't need to be changed in order to be that. 
My back-up is 20 years of lectures and writings by John Nash on what gives gold its value and how that could be harnessed into an international digital currency with a stable supply.
And his conclusion is that, left to its own, it will asymptotically bring our EXISTING fiat legacy systems towards ideality. 
Bitcoin as a coffee money is petty petty thinking.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:19:08
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:52:46


Well there is convenience in price stability. That might be agreeable enough, I think maybe you don't believe in the possibility of price stability.  But what about the approach towards it?


Yes this has been clearly illustrated throughout our history as nash points out. But he also points out that the CONCEPT of a money that is perfectly comparable to a price index of an optimally chosen basket of commodities is NOT corruptible.  We can at the very least, use it in thought experiment can we not?


Well there is only one optimal, but when we talk about subjective Hayek especially suggests that the individual cannot know as well as the whole.  I am not sure you will agree, or rather perhaps maybe you will like it but I think we can think of the aggregate of the individuals' views as the objective view.  Price, determined by the markets is the ultimate objective view.
Ideal money, conceptually, theoretically, would be the perfect barometer in regard to the stability of those prices over time, but here we are talking really about the value of the currencies it is being compared to, rather than simply commodities on the market.
@_date: 2016-12-21 04:27:48

@_date: 2016-12-22 17:59:54
This is where we differ.  When Nash says "it is possible to control inflation by controlling the supply of a money".  Issuers of fiat are forced, or given "will" by your words, to compete and issue money of increasing quality, which in the Nashian sense means stability of value.
It is not at all at odds with the Austrian or non-Austrian view. I think rather we live in a world where some money is best used like a hot potato and some money is best saved.  
It's not a proper experiment to simply compare the quality of monies and discussion our social nature in relation to them.  
Rather we can think of how ALL systems might rise towards this level of perfection in regard to stability of value.  That is to say what would it mean for all national fiats to become asymptotically ideal?
Governments/central banks have the power to do this, but simply lack the incentive right?

There is no content in what you just said.  And there is no sense or logic in an argument that adding a millionth user is exponentially better than the 100th etc.
What the law explains is the POTENTIAL for value, because of the network created.  There is nothing to say that there is an implication for that value to exist, be created, or be used.
It's like saying if 10 roads in a city are useful then 1000's of roads would be WAYYY more useful.  Of course there is a limit to usefulness because empty highways don't provide value right?

We KNOW that its value changes, in relation to fiat, when fiat is either expected to be good or bad.  And we can ascertain this by comparing gold to first fait, and then to other commodities at times when fiat is perceived to have different or same qualities of stability of value itself.

I argue these really aren't the implied problems, or rather they are the petty ones.

@_date: 2016-12-27 23:46:29


That excess demand comes from speculators who are speculating that gold will take on new use cases at some point in the future. If the dollar collapses it’s reasonable to think that gold might play a role in whatever monetary system emerges from the ashes. If some nations switch to a gold standard, or if central banks start buying gold for their reserves, or even if people are bartering directly with gold coins, then gold will be demanded for those purposes
This understanding of gold when highlighted will allow your ignorance on the subject to shine through to the well read and knowledgeable players. That gold's price comes largely from speculators of use cases is silly.  Gold is looked at as an inflation hedge vs fiat's because of the nature of its cost of mining especially (and of course ultimately its supply).


Yes but you ignore how special of an event it would be if our governments printed stable money.


This hypothetical is not otherwise possible without the introduction of a stable deflationary (in relation to gold) currency.  But now that it is, such a hypothetical would allegedly bring bliss, as, and Nash perfectly explains this in ideal Money, it is exactly the problem society is trying to, and needs to solve in order to end conflict in this world.
Regardless of your ignorance, you perfectly paint the bridge to Nash's insights.
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:21:12


Yes and there is good reason for this and that it serves a problem you have not explored.  Why do you think John Nash said this in his essays about how an e-currency with a stably issued supply will move us past the keynesian era of economics:








by the voluntary choice of human agencies. And these resp-onsible agencies, being naturally of the domain of polit-ically derived authorities, would need to make appropriate efforts to achieve such a goal and to pay the costs that are entailed before their societies can benefit. And the benefits would come from the improvement in the quality of this public utility (money) which serves to facilitate the game-theoretic function of "the transfer of utility".

When Satoshi announced the 1mb limit, the IMMEDIATE subsequent posts were in regard to the social/political difficulty of removing it in the future. MANY people, or at least some intuitive ones, immediately saw the problem
I have always looked at it and said it's impossible to move, at least especially in regard to making bitcoin a coffee money. 
People that think its obvious that it will get removed and easily so, do not understand the problem in the first place, and this is why they think core is "dumb".
When your conclusion is that smart people are dumb, you need to rethink if bitcoin is simple or too complex for you to understand. It might be the latter, and thus why you are at odds with the reality of the situation.  Don't take my word for it, but at least hear out the argument that you clearly have never heard.

Allow us to reframe the problem though.  Ideal Money as a tangible implementation MIGHT not be possible as you allude to.  Gold is "good" in this sense...but what does that mean?  What is gold stable in relation to?  We can say WHY it is stable, and what's favored properties are, but what is it stable in comparison to?

This community is effectively comprised itself. They were lead by bitcoin's ex "chief scientist"  to believe that he was able to confirm Craig Wright was Satoshi using a private key/verification process. 
But this process doesn't prove what was claimed, the claim was a hoax, yet much of the community continued to act in ignorance of this obvious hoax.
If assange is being verified in the same fashion, all I can say is that is two hoax's with the same MO.

I watched the video.  Krishnamurti is a man that was bruce lees inspiration, Krishnamurti erases our frames (through lecture).
The problem of society is that there is scare resources and land and an optimal distribution for efficient use of them. It is observed and understood that the market is an institution that allows us to optimize the distribution of commodities by objectively valuating them.  In order to do so we use money, and that money must have a stable value.
In our history our money standards have always eventually been corrupted.  
Ideal Money is money that is stable in "price" or what is properly described as value.  Bitcoin is good money but not necessarily expected to be ideal.  bitcoin as a settlement with sidechannels etc. seems optimal.  There is no scientific or rational basis for targeting maximal transactional capacity...
it doesn't create ideal money and therefore doesn't attend to the problem of society.

And of course my understanding and explanation lack in comparison to Nash, but as time has gone by my conviction about the relevance and significance has grown rather than waned.
What's partly hidden in his thesis is that our ability and want to collectively discuss "ideal money" is related to the genera quality of our currency systems themselves.
You might understand this meme board in the way I have explained now but still also understand how people don't follow Nash's insight because they don't have the proper context:

Rather I suspect the outcome of this is not determinable.  And I suspect he didn't want to leave it in the hands of the masses like so many people claim was bitcoin's purpose. 
I suspect his view is completely in line with Szabo's. I've seen many peoples say they have lost respect for Szabo and Satoshi over this (assuming the email was from him)...which is ridiculous...
but more importantly, if the issue is so obviously planned for resolution by Satoshi, then why the debate? If it is so obvious, and SO many people in the community see it and want it....
WHY THE DEBATE?  Whats the contentious issue? 
Why does szabo not like gavin and hearns proposal, or Back, or Todd...
Its just a bunch of people on reddit that don't know why there is a debate in the first place.
"Big blockers" calling any logical argument stupid because they haven't understood anything.
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:19:13
Can we be clear on something.  "Argument from authority", doesn't mean we ignore the most knowledgeable peoples opinion on the subject. 
If we are talking about the pope, or a high school debate that's one thing.  But ignoring the "authority" who is authority because of their intelligence on a given subject is not what that phrase means.
I've heard A LOT of posters here say let the people decide.  
Thats not the solution to society and optimal technology.  The peoples are idiots.  You want the authority to decide, where authority doesn't mean your ruler, it means the peoples that are most knowledgeable about the debate at hand.

The uneducated view would be "I want bitcoin for coffee purchases lets raise the block size to scale like visa"
So we can expect what you describe, but I think what just happened was a WHOLE lot of peoples got a wake up call about what things really mean.
A lot of people that don't understand why their "Raise the block size now!" threads aren't having the result they wanted are seemingly taking a second look at why this "debate" is happening in the first place.

Then Nick Szabo and Satoshi seemingly don't agree? Well what I am saying is Szabo seemed to suggest that Hearn and Gavin's proposal was reckless.
And their proposal seems to be what you are suggesting to a large extent, otherwise what are we disagreeing about.
But also, it seems that Todd and Back disagree with what you suggest was Satoshi's vision. Which is strange for what is obvious reasons.
And it suggests you think that recent email allegedly by Satoshi was "obv fake" but is also strange to me that both Back and Todd seemed to support the content (regardless of who wrote it each of them said).
But what is the most strangest is all these top and core devs that disagree that there is a clear and obvious path here cannot see the simple obvious vision that Satoshi "seemingly" explicitly described. 
I get your view, I really do, but why does the reality not make sense here?

@_date: 2015-08-13 05:35:54

@_date: 2017-11-22 19:50:47
You are too new here to understand what the subject is about.
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:06:47
I understand your point, and possibly some don't.  But it is still a consensus required. It might then seem a lot easier to suggest that this consensus needn't be so predetermined theoretically, but I still think we are fairly locked.  
Its not ALL changes that we want to be doomed to this, but the major ones.  Basically you must accept some philosophical and theoretical weaknesses in order for bitcoin to be so robust.   And I suspect society was presented the exact trade off when satoshi inconspicuously changed the block limit to 1mb.
Gavin once said "I wish he didn't do that", and I think he's being cheeky.  I think it was theoretically known that it had to be done, and very widely speculated and believed that it couldn't be changed in the future. 
Maybe we will agree on a modest increase.  But I suspect more and more peoples will wake up to the realization that any time you can get society to make significant changes to bitcoin then ultimately bitcoin is not secure. 
I suspect this debate is an attack on security.  
Jon Matonis and others have joked about opening the debate on bitcoin's inflation schedule.  I see this as exactly that, something we need to all put to rest as things we will never change, or until we are a completely different level of society.

And nobody is trying to exclude bitcoin users from low value transactions other than they will be costly.  MH has a topic, this op has a topic, and it is very clear that there is not such valid point or evidence to suggest that bitcoin should not function in a way that discourages low value transactions.  This is exactly how gold has historically functioned and it has had a very valuable use in our society for many many years.

What is the difficulty? The problem is understood in relation to “reference points”.
We could see **the truer measure of such an economy depends rather on the nature of the reference point being used.**
Historically gold had served as a great reference point for the Breton woods system, but in various ways it seems the world has evolved beyond the utility of gold for such a basis.
Today the USD is quite a favored reference point for many countries, but there are reasons for both the US and all non US countries why such a reference is not favorable and hence we seem to be evolving beyond such a centralized solution.
Bitcoin however, includes all of the favorable properties of gold and more.
**I think we might benefit from a community discussion on the possibility of using bitcoin as a decentralized reference point for each governments inflation targeting systems.**

You are stuck with viewing the problem from only the "satoshi" angle, where as Nash is thinking on a grander scale from a different perspective (albeit with bitcoin no doubt in mind).  The "ideal" here is not the stabilization in price that you are referring to but rather a perfect or ideal predictability in relation to the supply of a currency or commodity (or and ideal commodity basket), and the costs associated with producing it.  Nash explains why gold serves this purpose well although does also have historical faults.  There is other commodities that also serve to be at least part of a good basis for money.
Bitcoin having a very predictable production or issuance rate becomes a good standard for many all of the reasons Nash lists that gold has historically served this.  


The creation or levation of "ideal money" or money with a properly calculated supply/inflation schedule is something that must be brute force with the most powerful computer available-the free market pricing system described by hayek.


If we are only thinking of whether bitcoin is ideal money, or whether it will have a stable price, then we are not understanding the scope or genius of Nash's thesis.  He writes well beyond the introduction of a currency with a stable supply.


Cliffs: it is not a physical standard per se but rather a mathematical relation that nash not only defines and highlights but also extrapolates a solution as to how to implement this standard, using what he calls an "asymptotically ideal money" which is a money what's inflation rate tends towards zero.

As individuals we are opinionated on the decision.  We want to sways things to our own side.  But society doesn't work like that.  It is a choice that society must make and in that the true factors involved seem far out of our control.  
WHAT, will be the path we choose?  It seems futile to debate about it in some ways, in order to come to a logical decision because the fate of this civilization rests on so many cause that are far out of the scope of such debate.
Accepting things as fate (which is only one view), what are the ramifications of the different paths of bitcoin.
If you had an infinite universe and infinite civilizations that are given the same choice we are, what will the different paths/choices ramifications be for the future of these civilizations that might make a different block size choice.

It certainly needs to evolve, but there is still the grayness of the line as to exactly where that evolution should be and not be.  There is presumably some core part that shouldn't evolve it seems, or shouldn't evolve UNTIL we are a very different type of civilization.
So I guess I mean I can agree if it couldn't evolve it AT ALL it would be worthless, eventually, maybe quick...but that doesn't address what should evolve and whether it is block size.  My understanding was that was why J. Matonis made a cheeky comment about changing the inflation schedule.  
What should be changeable and what shouldn't becomes the question.  I hope I stayed on point.  Thx for the article btw!

Its more complex than that.  We have evolved for hundred of years since Gresham Law was highlighted. We now have a universal money that government need not "accept".  Gresham's law hints at a type of "quality" of money that we haven't socially understood.
Bitcoin is 'good' or 'strong', in the same sense of the force behind gresham's law that drives money in certain directions. 
Gresham's law is relevant:

Your case, and MH case and logic is that bitcoin shouldn't have a low limit because it can't be a high value transactional medium since we have never had one in our history.  But we have had one and it is gold.  And so there is no argument there.  This is clear.
The fact that people wouldn't use gold or bitcoin in this instance for coffee is not a relevant or evidence of anything.  It simply means it wouldn't be used for coffee.


No but you see nash did explain all this.  And you are acting like you know the history of economics, but we can clearly see you don't.  Nash lists all the reason gold COULD be used for such a standard, but he also lists the reason it has failed.  Which is relevant to the nixon shock and the bretton woods standard. Bitcoin beats gold in every form and fashion when it comes to an international standard, as Nash states: 


(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.
(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be “politically appealing.” so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.
(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.


Keeping the block low does not defeat 3 in any form or fashion.  But striving to use bitcoin as a coffee currency destroys a type of economic stability that we have sought since the existence of society.  Something stronger and more finite than gold that each nation can rely on for a basis to our global economy.
I realize it seems i have a predetermined notion, but really its just that you don't like my notion because you have started with the belief that we need an international coffee money and that it must be bitcoin.  Thats not science.
What we need, is an international standard.  Better and stronger than gold.  And it turns out bitcoin can be this, and only bitcoin can be this.  But unfortunately we cannot have our standard and our coffee money too. 
Bitcoin IS the internet, an evolution of it, and at some point it became intelligent to take a piece of that internet and put a restriction on it (21 million coins), and then it became intelligent to put a 1mb restriction on that part of the internet.  And so you see it sometimes does make sense to restrict the whole internet, but regardless it is a terrible metaphor. 
You haven't studied the economics at all.  You made your decision that bitcoin should be money everyone can use cheaply, and you make points that don't even support such a claim.

This is twisting things. Nobody is trying to mold bitcoin into something that FORCES only high value transactions.  Proponents of 1mb know that no change will lead people to only use bitcoin for high value transactions.  But people can still use it for coffee all they like. Just like gold. 


You are missing the need and purpose of a new gold standard for international cooperation.  The historical precedent is that we need exactly that.  This is well discussed and explained in 20 years of lectures by John Nash.  We cannot ignore such economics. 
NO other coin can provide this.  Bitcoin is first, and bitcoin cannot be changed.  Alts can do many many things, but they cannot be the basis for all of this.  There can only be one, bitcoin.  And that is its value.  If you change that, then it has no value.

This is what is needed I think, and I have ideas but I know I am not capable of it.  I suspect that bitcoin as a highly transactable low cost currency requires a highly optimized change/solution that we cannot foresee or predict.  We can get "better" but not best. On the other hand, bitcoin as a high cost lower transaction settlement layer is something that doesn't rely on such foresight but rather stability of its parameters.  
Not all parameters will be un-evolvable, but the more parameters that are locked in the more stable bitcoin is for the purpose of, for example, a new digital gold standard.
From there the best, easiest, most stablest solution would be to show with game theory, that there is not incentive for change amongst the community.  Or in other words with so many different options available for the community, and the entropy on not reaching a consensus seemingly growing more and more assured, it seems we could more quickly get to a point where no change can happen.
I think this could be shown, where as proving the possibility of consensus might only be possible in practice

The simple view of central banking being that banks manipulate their monetary policy depending on their goals.  They print money and adjust interest rates etc. in order to serve the public.  Since there is competition on the markets with respect to other investments, its clear they must print money of better and better quality in order for their currencies to "survive".
By "better" we mean something specific and complex, but it is highlighted by price on a free market.

Yes the quoting of the other posters is me showing the likelihood Satoshi knew that waiting until the future would create a likelihood that consensus to change from 1mb would be incredibly difficult at best. 
I understand the rest, and maybe agree to some extent, but that is the missing context that isn't written anywhere.  Because if he knew it would be difficult he would have been explicit, and he wasn't explicate, hence THE DEBATE.
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:16:46


This is too general to be correct. Many countries are in agreements in regards to gold.  Suggesting because these are not standard financial type agreements so they don't count as high value settlement doesn't follow reason. 




Yes this, but this does not support Hearn's paper, and suggesting that bitcoin should not do this either. In fact it suggests there is a need for such a thing...
It suggests that gold is falling not because its failing but because its being replaced.  
The facts are fine, but they don't support the argument for a high block size.

I have long felt it might be easiest to show the likelihood that no such consensus can be made for change. Possibly with a list of all the players, their incentives, their wants etc...there might be the obvious realization there can be no consensus for change whether through experts or the "economically". 
Or, perhaps there is nearly enough consensus for change, or not change, and highlighting the truer numbers might cause one side to tip the scales.
Just seems like to me we can't determine OPTIMAL size for the future NOW (with so little empirical data on a new technology), and so the next best thing is to find a stable consensus.  
In that we might be able to achieve it without change.

Never said people who want bigger blocks are wrong.  That is UR assumption because you THINK and SUSPECT i want small blocks.

Sure many smart people might share their opinion.  But this is the reason why its 80%/20% amongst the community, but thats not a really number of consensus since most of the 80% are actually clueless as to the importance of the debate.

@_date: 2015-08-10 19:04:50
My understanding is that there are a plethora of peoples that have no idea what the debate really is about.  They don't know that they don't know.  And they are saying "This is obvious, raise the block size so everyone can use bitcoin for everything."
Excluding those people, there is some rational consensus a large size would be good, but the costs are difficult to weigh since it is essentially speculation. 
Bitcoin used to be theoretical, but now it stands on its own merits. It is difficult to theoretically dispute the living experiment.   
There seems to be a worry that infinitely or arbitrarily large block sizes encourage centralization of mining pools. 
"No increase" would possibly suggest bitcoin be only used for high value transactions like international settlements etc.  
Generally people don't seem to want to face the fact that you need consensus for change, and there doesn't seem to be near enough consensus.  For this reason I consider this debate a silly attack on bitcoin's stability.  I suspect it would be easiest to show that groups are so divided that there will never be a consensus until society changes radically...
For this I think it might make sense that many developers are indifferent but enjoy postulating different solutions ;)
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:24:04


This is what I mean by I could agree with a lot of your points, but its helpful that we understand I am disagreeing exactly with this.  We don't get to say this.  Satoshi, whomever he/she or they are, created something nothing of us could.  We aren't sure of the logic behind what is moral here.
Bitcoin was meant to "scale", but not at the rate proposed necessarily.  And more and more I get the impression that Satoshi knew bitcoin shouldn't change in this regard until we are a completely different society (ie doesn't fight).
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:54:55
We can say in a sense bitcoin will be a more reliable store of value as time goes by in regards to its inflation schedule right?   But then the currencies it competes with must also adjust towards optimal schedules or the markets will kill them.  My understanding is this should be its purpose.
I too think we shouldn't want change for these things.  But I suspect it will be easy to show in the future that society CAN'T come to a consensus for such change.  And that this inability grows like entropy.
Violence can be observed in regards to "backing" or "adopting" a(n especially) weak currency, but I don't think this is a necessary or useful component. I think rather its a misapplication of game theory, where as violence is more just a rational strategy which suggests it isn't really what we mean by violence at all.
In this I think the truth is, the levation of the standard nash describes, which is above and beyond into the future of bitcoin, but uses bitcoin to get there...is what will end violence in the social way we tend to mean it.
A monetary unit, perfectly based on ideality, brute force by the machine he describes fueled by Keynesian horses and bitcoin. 
Being cheaper to use over time, might have a different meaning in regards to a world with a monetary standard, and perhaps this is the issue people have seeing a lot of this.

yup a lot of people understand that.  But a lot of people want to buy coffee with bitcoin and they think that is justification for a bigger block size. 
Don't think of it in hindsight, think foresight.  You are gonna put a limit on, otherwise it can't grow. Sure if there is consensus the limit can be changed, but who can guarantee consensus?
All you are saying here is that Satoshi couldn't foresee this argument, yet I think it was obviously inevitable. So what seems to me an innocent decision, may have been one of those "People in the future will hate me for this...but eventually they will understand."
I still think we want a stable consensus more so than an ideal block size.  Bitcoins strength seems to lay in that which cannot change.

Ur just stating the thesis of John Nash's Ideal Money here.
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:22:05
"Ideal Money" is a proposal John Nash left for the world. The key points are:
1) Nash foretold of a coming electronic global currency in the form of a stably issued monetary supply that would take the power of the governments and central banks to print money.
2) Nash points out different periods of history where wise and scientific decisions were made by either one persons or a small group of persons that necessarily effected the quality of society based on the quality of decision and money standard at the time. 
3) Nash talks about Gresham's Law and how bad money supplants the good (not the other way around!), and rather if the peoples want good money then it must be by their own will and the politicians that represent them that will decide to adopt such a standard.
4) Ideal Money does NOT suggest bitcoin is Ideal because everyone thinks they can use it or because it is decentralized or has a locked supply.  Ideal Money talks about a global standard like that of gold, in which all nations can begin to define their own currencies in relation to such a standard we all agree on. The future RESULT, is a trend towards Ideality.
I see two choices for the future of bitcoin in this regard.  We can try to make bitcoin the new currency, without considering the ramifications in relation to the current global financial system.... or we can choose to have a new gold standard that can bring peace and harmony among nations. 
I think then players like Nash, Satoshi, Szabo, and those that have carefully contemplated this debate for many years have realized the great difficultly is convincing the masses to let go of what they think is "Ideal Money".  Money is the thing we all must agree on, money is the thing that represents a solution to that which we CANNOT agree on.  This debate isn't about the "I", this debate is about the "we". 
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:11:17
The former, yes the quality of a money is related to the supply.  Especially when the supply is seemingly arbitrary (bad quality) and therefore instable. 
The "quality" is in regards to the gresham sense.  But that is not a qualitative explanation but rather a phenomenon.  The phenomenon described in greshams law outlines a possible difference of quality between good and bad money. I have not expanded on it so you are correct to question the point I gloss over.
For the latter yes, in the past governments have not (especially recently) been competing but this all happen in relation to the emergence of a good standard of universal comparison.  Historically gold has taken this emerging function today we have a new gold that has stronger qualities.

Furthermore Nash has been describing a machine that is far far bigger and more significant than this little bitcoin experiment.  For 20+ years he has gone into incredible detail as to the philosophical underpinnings of this machine, how it works, why it works, and what it will evolve into...
This machine uses bitcoin as its "batteries".  I didn't say Nash is Satoshi (here), I'm pointing at facts.

Thank you. 
What isn't "secure" is my feeling as a customer when a pop up comes up after 1 year and says "enter your bday".
Not an explanation of much sorts at all, just something that might or might not be a legitimate window.
I am not complaining about your tech, but rather the "UI".
And although you clearly do "have a brain", I'm confused on how we can't immediately see its alarming and disheartening that I must add more security info.  I think rather than explain the website is hoping I don't make a big deal out of the exact thing that is the big deal.
The impact is small on the one hand of a failed transaction, but on the other hand such a fail is real a zero in terms of insurance.  Ultimately there is an insurance provided here, which the client builds up, and where is the security in being able to collect in the future.
What I am saying is if a $5 bitcoin transaction doesn't go through, what will, should, or could, happen in the future if the price hits $1000 overnight (or .01 etc.)
You are certainly a company, but the business model as I see it, is the provision of a fancy exchange with a giant security leak. 
This leads me to the conclusion of 2 possibilities: either satoshi works for you, and there is something big I am not seeing...
or 2 there is no business model here. Just my opinion, but I will end with saying I REALLY REALLY REALLY like the idea of bitreserve....
but your transactions can NEVER fail, and you need a more secure feeling customer experience imo....I would think that would be the backbone of your business...
I am sorry if i am still confused about your service, I just wanted to log in today because I was excited you offer my nations fiat, and then I couldn't log in because I'd rather not enter my b-day.

See I'm not the one who is supposed to be knowledgeable and have this debate, but it seems 99% of the debate is being had by peoples that aren't discussion the subject me and you are right here.
My understanding was a lower finite limit is towards the decentralized sphere.  Maybe its any limit, but I am under the impression large block size encourages centralization of mining pools. 
Its true there are many dimensions to possible proposals and again I think people generally do not understand how difficult that makes coming to a significant consensus.
As for the extra features, having an international uncorruptable  gold standard is in and of itself enough for adoption imo.  21 million of the most valuable thing in the world, divisible.  
This is not the end all be all though.  From what I have read from Nash's "ideal money" this standard will slowly force the levation of a new standard of money.  A new line, that is basically based on an ideal icpi...but is implemented and solved by turning the Keynsian banks into a brute force market discovery solution. 
On top of that, it seems to me that having the blockchain, provides many many uses and that for every person that suggests bitcoin must have extra uses there can always be another that says having only 1 or few uses is bitcoin's purpose.

There is some absurdity depending on how we formulate and solve the problem: 


I think we are not seeing the picture from the future perspective.  Seems to be a very similar setup as the Bretton Woods, but BW was somewhat manipulable and not stable for reasons stated above. The possibility of a finite internet currency that is immutable and theoretical cost-less to transport (well vs other commodities) creates an opportunity for a stronger standard.  By introducing it was an inflation rate that asymptotically decreases to zero, many of the problems Nash outlines with regards to its implementation are solved...
From there the question is how do we get each country to print a money that is ideal in the sense Nash describes and the answer is a natural evolution through the pressure gold 2.0 creates as a universal option to hedge vs inflation.

None of what you are saying suggests that bitcoin should not function like gold.  It suggests that IF bitcoin is to be our world currency THEN we might not mold it into a high value only transactionable material.


And your very first sentence alluded to the obvious reality of gold's historical purpose, not as a money but as a settlement of account between nations and at various times in our history.  
It is obvious gold was this.  And it seems obvious to me bitcoin can and will become and remain this.  
And you will still be able to buy coffee with it, just as you say gold wasn't "ONLY" for high value transactions, but of course it generally would be silly and impracticable to use gold or bitcoin this way depending on how we molded bitcoin.
The continued circular argument that bitcoin must be arranged for frequent low value transactions because it should not function like gold, is circular. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 02:32:50
He is stalling and changing the subject before he finally describes the phenomenon of the public's choice to use a good currency over a bad currency. Good and bad have special meaning in which the context changes over time.
In more ancient times money that was debased was circulated internally (like hot potato!) in a society while "good" money, was hoarded or sent abroad. 
Thus the 'honesty' of a money is something that satoshi needed to spend a lot of time considering.  In the end bitcoin is honest because of its stable monetary supply...
The rest is the question of how the public will adopt bitcoin and/or why.

This isn't sound logic to me.  If bitcoin needs to evolve to stay valuable then this might hold ground.  But he hasn't shown this, and more importantly the goal posts aren't defined as to what needs to evolve and what doesn't in order for bitcoin to be "valuable".  Probably we need to define worthlessness or worthiness as well (value etc.).
The further point is that the ability to hold the community ransom in order to block change is seemingly the very strength of the entire genius proposed by Satoshi. It means any given party can keep the good parts from being changed. 
I feel like this is an advanced version of, we want bitcoin to scale huge therefore block size should increase.  It's not really an argument with support, but just a circle verification no?

Nash refers to this as Asymptotically Ideal money, money that approaches a inflation rate of zero with respect to supply at infinite (philosophically): 






Nash doesn't propose a plan or implementation of Ideal Money, idealness is theoretical, Asymptotically ideal money is his tangible implementation.


Yes and this is why Nash explains the value of these comparisons, but for various reason specific to each:


issue of the "true" evaluation of per capita wealth.)
Possibly the full psychological effect of human "ownership" of the surface of Mars would not be realized until that area had been divided into plots regarded as the private property of specific corporate or personal owners!
 


I can't find the comparison to stamps but is about an historical Asian postage system that served as banking/currency for its time. 


Well some commodities have issues in regards to their cost of transport as well, here are some other relatable points:






(i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.
(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be “politically appealing.” so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.
(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.
However, right now platinum would be even better than gold, because it has more value per unit of weight.


So for various reasons certain commodities have ideal attributes but there COULD be created or thought of more ideal standards. 


There are many factors that make up an ideal standard such as how gold had historically functioned for different societies or economies at different times. Nash does in fact discuss when Isaac Newton gave Britain Great Power by tying the British pound to gold (1717?) 


It only needs to be more “predictable” in the “idealness” sense Nash describes:






This is very related to the below.


The problem is that there becomes incentive for each government to be the first to defect irregardless of the peoples wants:


So in the current game the problem has been unsolvable for the peoples who do not control their own monies.

No it is not a serious flaw by its own definition.  You have first decided what bitcoin should be, and then you have reasoned from that it is a serious flaw.  For EXAMPLE. If bitcoins happened to be perfect the way it is in regards to all hard forks, then you would definitely want something like a 100% consensus only.
So when you look from a different perspective, needing such a consensus could be a PERFECT security feature.
So you don't have an argument that involves "needing consensus is hard and therefore that is bad."


There is no substance here.  But 1 CAN suggest that an implementation that has 100% consensus is "good" by any definition of yours that has less consensus

"Rapid inflation is easily measured, on a national level, by a domestically defined "cost of living" index. So if the cost of living, as measured by another agency than central banking authorities, were not rising (when expressed in terms of the domestic money) then one could feel assured that there was not inflation.
    However this requirement is actually a little too strong (for a properly good money worthy to be called 
of "ideal" type)! It is actually quite natural for the calculated "cost of living" to be rising, even when meas-ured, say, in terms of gold, whenever there is so much technological progress that the people in an area, without working harder, are lifted to a higher standard of living by the rapid progress, as if each human would become the beneficiary of the assistance of 3 robot helpers to do

The last key pieces of relevant history were mostly highlighted and discussed by John Nash in his lecture series “Ideal Money” Nash points out different key stable periods in our economic history such as when Isaac Newton pegged the British Pound to Gold in 1717.  The relevance of this in relation to our history is great, but its importance is highlighted further when understood in relation to the Bretton-Woods system which emerged from WII:


This system was meant to be created and implemented BEFORE the end of the war.  It is thought that we had already learned the dangers of not having an economic plan ready for the “rebuilding period” that followed WWI since negotiating and cooperating before the end of the war might be more easily achieved between “allies”.
Unfortunately (for us) the system, like all the standards before it, could not hold.  Eventually the system gave way to “political pressure” largely through what is known as the Nixon Shock:


Looking at the history of money, it seems we are in great need of some form of an unbreakable, politically incorruptible, standard for economic consensus.

I've already put out threads explaining that this is not the truth, if it were there would be no debate.  Satoshi wasn't explicate about this.  And nothing you are saying or others are saying explicitly shows that bitcoin should have a bigger block size.  
Satoshi DIDN'T imply the solution to this and thats why there IS a debate.  Purposefully there is no superior being that is to decide this because that wouldn't be a decentralized decision right?
Keeping the block size the same does not change the ability for people to have it or use it.  What it changes is their ability to use it in the way YOU intend it to be used.
YOUR intent, does NOT imply a logical foundation for the block size debate.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:58:17
My understanding is that theoretically it does scale.  This leaves two issues, proof by experiment, and the issue of implementation/boot strap.
To me the security is that the more valueable things the blockchain is used for, the more valuable it will be (ie price/value), and so the more value their is for security...
That is my understanding of the theoretical proof. 
But that doesn't cover all the specific nuances and possible pitfalls.  I suspect many were theorized and dealt with before hand, but also many that were expected (or not expected) and ultimately to be dealt with as they arise.

It's difficult to get and keep Nash into context.  Here is the rest of relevant quotes:




 &gt;   So I feel that the macroeconomics of the Keynesians is comparable to a scientific study of a mathematical area which is carried out with an insufficient set of axioms. And the result is analogous to the situation in plane geometry, the plane does not need to be really flat and the area within a circle can expand hyperbolically as a function of the radius rather than merely with the square of the radius.

Try this lecture: 
I think people just read the first couple words and lines and then go blank....let's try reading this to the finish and then commenting:














 &gt;    It seems possible and not unlikely, however, that if two states evolve towards having currencies or more stable value as measured locally by national CPI indices that then also these distinct currencies would tend to evolve towards more stable comparative relations of value.

There is a thread on 2plus2 poker forum that used to list them, I am not a member but there is a search function.  Seals with clubs is the best.  There are also projects in development (years already), which will be serverless and decentralized like bitcoin. 
I mean to be blunt not rude, I am one of the leading thinkers/writers on the subject :)
I meant it when I suggested poker sites are like banks, think about the difficulty of creating a bank, and then getting people to adopt the money you issue.

Something I never seem to hear/read in hearns works, gavins, or really anyone's, and that is the economics but in regards to the global financial system. Seems like there are relevant considerations.  
I'm not necessarily for either side, but I do find it all an interesting discussion. 
Most of the arguments put forth are quite easily rebutted imo in a way that shows both sides could have a reasonable point, which is why I tend to feel that those that sit back and observe the two sides of the problem are seemingly more on point.
For example if we say x, xx, xxx, and xxxx...so on groups prefer a larger block size, we might just be giving away the power of our money and our decision as citizens to these groups and most important and specifically about that, these groups, like our governments and central banks might have incentive to behave and perform for their own interests that are not in line with the citizens.
So I think more caution is generally needed than peoples are putting forth.
I also think we should be relating this to the pyramids. I have no doubt we have had this problem many times over the course of our evolving civilization.  Where the vast majority of the citizens are demanding a well planned out and calculated implementation of block size.  And a few of the top architects are trying to explain to the peoples the limitations of the problem and why such foreknowledge cannot exist. 
I cannot help but think after reading this blog, that such "architects" exist that want to explain to the population that idealness can't be achieved (nor is necessary) and the next best thing is a STABLE consensus. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:19:08
No you still don't get what I am saying and its simple.  lets say 40% of people are intelligent.  20% might want increase, and 20% might want 1mb.  But the 60% of society that isn't intelligent, just instantly gravitates towards bigger block sizes. 
Not telling you what side is right, I'm telling you where all the trolls will exist.
And a troll is easy to spot in this argument because they open with "I don't even understand why this debate is hard?"

This is the thesis of Nash's [Ideal Money](
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:04:56
Thx.  I feel like you are underestimating bitcoin in this post. Imagine you have the potential to make a world currency.  Think of how intensely important this is.  Think of how significant such a creation is.  Would you guess at the parameters yourself?  21 million coins?  Is that enough?
Satoshi's grasp of economy sucks?  Can't really take that seriously but don't you think that makes it obvious, unless satoshi is an ignorant idiot, that he would have consulted those who were very very familiar with the subject?
Nash has been speaking about how a currency technology in the form of a stably issued money will take away. the ability of central banks to print money.  Nash predicted a political evolution based on this change...
Don't you think Satoshi would have googled such things?  Talked to such people?
Do we really think he was like "Hey, I made a program, some of you should try it..."

"Now the possible area for evolution is that if, say, an inflation rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn’t a rate between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable?"
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:53:55
Then we are inline with everything but this realization.  There will always be the need in this world for the most singular basis point, like a gold standard.  And from it, all currencies will be issued in respect to it.  This has happened over and over throughout our history and can be seen and understood with careful introspection on this.
I point to john nash not because his lecture on ideal money is relevant to this debate.  I point to it because he had the bitcoin debate already with himself!
No one was listening, I'm not trying to say he was talking about something like bitcoin..i"m trying to say he was debating block size with himself for the last 20 years...
If we could have both my friend their would be no debate...but we can't...and this is why you don't yet understand this debate exists, and is not solvable by "bitcoin should be used to buy coffee, therefore raise the blocksize".
There are larger considerations and a current global economy in place that need to be considered.
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:43:03


Thats the same year Nash was on tour talking about how the advent of an electronic money in the form of a stably issued supply would create a new gold standard that would force central banks and governments to print currencies of ever evolving superior quality (

Yup, and so if you follow the logic, it seems satoshi knew there would be a very difficult debate in the future to solve.  A very difficult consensus to reach...

@_date: 2015-07-09 20:26:20
He suggested the addition of a "good" currency would create a barometer for each respective Keynesian type fiat:


In other words to effect change there only needs to be introduced a DECENT currency, not one that is fully ideal. "Ideal-ness" in this sense effectively refers to a money with a steady monetary supply: 


It's not bitcoin that is needed to be ideal, bitcoin just has to be good.  The competition it inspires forces and causes the respective national/Keynesian fiats to become "ideal".
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:18:59
Finally confirmed to me Hearn is ignorant.  I didn't know, but I must think Szabo feels the same.  Unless this is all a ruse. The clear realization here is satoshi left this mess purposefully and Hearn is trying to use consensus to overthrow Satoshi's authority. 
Hearn is defeating his own statement here and clearly showing his logic contradicts itself. 
Satoshi left a clear path forward so players like Hearn cannot do what he is trying to do.
The only other possibility is they all planned this to see how resilient the ecosystem is to such an attack.  Just like trying to raise the amount of coins would be an attack on bitcoins stability.

Here is one thing he concluded:






is comparable to a scientific study of a mathematical area which is carried out with an insufficient set of axioms. And the result is analogous to the situation in plane geometry, the plane does not need to be really flat and the area within a circle can expand hyperbolically as a function of the radius rather than merely with the square of the radius. (This picture suggests the pattern of inflation that can result in a country, over extended time periods, when there is continually a certain amount of gradual inflation.)

I think we can resolve this by my saying in Nash's view "ideally" there would be no fluctuation, but I think all these great mens then realized that is an "ideal" but not a tangible implementation or a thing. 
Great minds use that simple observation (of something not necessary real) in order to construct the next best thing...
which I think would be a free floating market that can determine the true quality of each money.

I more or less agree but I think for example:


that these things change and arise basically at the same time.


If we mean developed over successive iterations then I agree.  But the ideal money cannot be conceived, it is too complex. 


I also think bitcoin is not the ideal currency but I think it can serve as a different role depending on the geo/political/economic structure of our global society.

I believe you mean geometrically.  Exponentially is very fast.
My understanding is a 1mb block turns bitcoin into gold.  Something that becomes a store of wealth for nation sized transactions rather than coffee.
Furthermore I suspect we are already stuck and cannot (for a very long time) come up with a consensus for such radical change...
I suspect proposal for change is like an attack on bitcoins current state, and I suspect all players are already in a Nash Equillbrium (ie no one can gain by unilaterally changing) and we don't have the tools for cooperative change until AFTER this discussion is solved.
I suspect that satoshi knew this. But that this debate must be made without him, so that the population is free to come to their own stable consensus without a leader.
Everyone wants their coffee and their bitgold too. But I think you cannot have bitcoin function as a fix all.  I think it can be a coffee coin, or a new gold standard for nations.  and I think the latter is far more important and far easier to achieve. 
**As for your question, it means bitcoin's security would be held up by its high value along with market driven transaction fees.**

Bitcoin gets its value from the stability of its value proposition, NOT from its transaction capacity.  It's value its NOT tied to that utility.  Transaction is not bitcoin's only utility and its not its most valuable utility.  That is your tacit ignorant assumption NOT based on real economics. 
Bitcoin's greatest utility is as a gold, an inflation hedge, and gold doesn't derive the "majority" of its value from its transaction capacity, it gets it from the stability of its value proposition (ie its stable production/supply in relation to the cost of production).

You have misunderstood.  Tether is not a money for people.  It is more like an internal unit of account.  Inflating it would only be stealing from themselves.  You are applying your analysis of real world banking to the purpose and function of the inter-operations of exchanges (cryptoexchangia). 
You have misunderstood the difference between the two plains and assumed that your understading, theories, and observerations are applicable.
There is no incentive to inflate Tether like there is fiat, there is great incentive to NOT inflate (or deflate!) Tether, from the exchanges point of view (but only exchanges that are PRO bitcoin).

If ethereum breaks it doesn't kill the poker industry that resides on cypher poker.  Its just like a server restart or software upgrade.  interrupts games but doesn't destroy the industry.
Doesn't require ethereum to be secure or immutable ;)

Yes and rationally is moral.  And he declared it as such publically on twitter so we know its his stance.
You can't say that "we" have a recourse which is a moral ground to fork away his profitability, because you haven't show he is acting immoral (and can't).
So what happens when miners profit and the users fork away their profits?  What happens when the users decide to make a chunk of the mining industry obsolete?
Who would want to be a miner?
And so the premise that we must maintain bitcoin's ability to evolve and grow in different utilities is an unfounded assumption.  The argument you give, which seems to extend properly and parallel to nullc's proposal, is non-sequitur.  
This would mean it's observable that the network would/will reject it.

I think you are missing the beauty of what you are saying and reading:








The idea is essentially a freer currency market puts pressure on all governments not to arbitrarily control money. This allows the markets to have a more educated and accurate "price discovery".


I think that someone else suggested to you that Nash felt money should be "constructed" to have a stable price.  Please remember, Nash talks about what is "ideal", as a concept, not as an implementation. He calls his plan for implementation "asymptotically ideal money".

I'm working with the cypherpoker developer.  We don't feel there are any more critical problems.  I know of 2 other projects each that either don't have a whitepaper or doesn't have a solution.  Most project are designing a front end.  Patrick has back end architecture with ethereum.  He's created a developer's environment sort of: 
Not all solutions are implemented we have just gotten to the point where you can play a hand of mental poker (no server).
His software auto installs and runs the ethereum software and is played as contracts on the ethereum chain (you can select the testnet).
Our solution uses an escrow system and the protocol in this thread might somehow end up being more efficient. 
The difference is we are creating a new infrastructure for ALL sites, not just our own implementation.
My contribution and understanding comes from my meditations on the subject: 
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:57:53
MANY people are suggesting it must.  Yes there is clear need for "hampering", you just have to read a little bit.  But more importantly you approach the problem not from reality.  Bitcoin is set to do many things, the argument it must ALSO be a coffee money is on that you must convince the protocol of.
It is not the thing you want to be.  So truly the question is, why hamper its use as other things?  In other words, you must give good reason to change it into a coffee money.  Cause that is not what it is set to be right now.

Ok I could help you with some value I think but I don't know if you want to hear it.  The question of bitcoin's volatility speaks to whether or not it could be seen as an inflation hedge or gold like in the sense of an inflation hedge. 
There is a US congressional report on bitcoin that explains if bitcoin become more relevant then the velocity of the USD would increase and so they would have to reign in the supply of dollars.  
This means they would lose control over monetary policy. 
This is the thesis of John Nash's Ideal Money.  And especially that the ultimate asymptotic result of the introduction of bitcoin as such a catalyst would be global stabilization. 
You spoke of Keynesianism and the austrian view, but your thesis is not complete without the Nashian view which is parallel to the Hayekian view. 
Both wrote dissertations in regard to the introduction of the end of government monopoly on money creation. 
The idea is it would bring the fractional reserve system into order. 
In this regard you have only presented a Keynesian view, not an Austrian and Keynesian view. 
I don't know how far into school you are, but you are Keynesian for this reason. 
But if you add Nash's view and insight to your works you will have laid the research ground for the awareness of his works..
And that could make you academically famous. 
What you should do is read Hayek's Denationalization of Money.  You could digest very quickly, its not a difficult read.  
He gives the premise of the end of governments control on money and then he expounds from there.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:57:37

Primecoin is like bitcoin but creates value by searching for prime numbers.
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:44:31
I think rather its confusing because it is out of context.  Nash talks about money that is honest and good but it is a definition we are not used to. 
Bitcoin is quite honest and good because its value/price is defined in relation to the cost of mining it. This makes it a good basis for measurement with respect to other currencies (albeit only after bitcoin has a sufficiently large adoption which is pretty much today). 
Other currencies represent their their respective nations production or value, but since the true value is impossible to calculate the peoples that print these currencies (ie central banks) can not necessarily properly match the amount of currency with the underlying growth or contraction in production.  
A currency that is not matched well with what it is supposed to represent is a dishonest currency or rather a bad currency.
This is a new form of understanding "quality" that is only successfully levated in the eyes of the markets because of bitcoin. Bitcoin is like having a thermometer to measure temperature rather than using philosophy!
@_date: 2016-02-02 08:56:12


I think I could re-solve this, but regardless I think most others would not realize what you point out here.  It might be old paradigms of socialism might have required force, and going forward they need less force because solutions allow it.  
I'm not sure one can be said to be better in that sense, much like old "science' might be viewed by new science as religion. 
It could also be probably shown that ultimately capitalism in its greatest form might lead to the socialist ideal. But I also wonder if in this black and white sense, socialists might not accept this, and they might need an explanation that gives their view more credit.
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:24:47

CAD is heavily dependent on oil for its economy.  Szabo pointed out in one of his blogs about the correlation between inflation expectation and oil prices.  Nash explained with a universal currency inflation expectation will lower because governments must print better quality money.
bitcoin causes inflation to go down, which causes oil to drop, which reflects in the price of the CAD. 
Canadian government then continues to reign in monetary policy in order to not lose control of CAD on the markets.

I'll tell you your mistake.  Sincerely.  All people are rational.  They follow their own functions given their own inputs.  When someone does something that seems irrational to you, in ONE SENSE it possibly is but in the economical model you use to understand the world, see them as rational, and it will clear thing up.
In regard to actual accepted economic we deal with the assumption of rationality because the results still help us understand reality.  It is not correct to wand wave that principle by saying "people aren't always rational".
It is very useful for people to realize that the academic reason bitcoin isn't ideal is because its deflationary, I'd agree its not a problem in the sense that things get cheaper, but that doesn't speak to the reality of our global financial system.  One of the reasons bitcoin's adoption isn't "hyper" is because everyone will tend (&lt;&lt;&lt; means on the whole or average not EVERYONE ALWAYS EVER!) to hodl bitcoin.

Well selgin calls what we call maybe cash, "inside money". Gold cannot be inside money, but typically it could and has been used as commodity money which is basically meaning "settlement money" (I think). 
There are arguments why gold is good for this but also arguments why its not perfect and no longer relevant. 
John Nash also gives this arguments and they are quite inline with what i have read of selgin thus far.

The problem is your analysis is in a vacuum.  You are stuck between the different paradigms of nationalism and global economy.  We are not viewing bitcoin from the perspective of a national or central bank. It is not the currency being issued for a subset group of people.  
Imagine it as a currency a higher authority (god if you will) prints for our national "banks"...but also the peoples can (choose to) skip the national banks if they don't like the 3rd party's shenanigans.

I might agree, I'm not sure all others would.  I think some of us, perhaps many of us in differing degrees, ultimately want bitcoin to be the great equalizer in regard to the wealthy elite. In this I think there is a socialistic tendency perhaps we are all "guilty" of. I do still wonder if the paradigm of socialism doesn't have a place though.  If not, or possible even if so, I think we are still in danger of the masses and the socialistic tendencies of peoples not otherwise exposed to the well thought out and articulated capitalistic arguments.
Perhaps the masses can never be "capitalist" in that regard though, and so Satoshi is needed to impose the great capitalist machine and revolution.
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:22:46
Hayek basically puts socialism as an idea that something which cannot be centrally planned is attempted to be centrally planned.  In this there seems to be a bridge in that there might be a mechanism that controls the means of production that is not really the definition of a central planner.  I don't expect many would agree that Capatalism vs Socialism is a false dichotomy.  I don't know though, I should ask more people!

No.  Obviously value is related to the aggregate of our beliefs (everyone).  But it can be trapped in a stable unit, a holder of it.  Once you see this, then you can build the rest of your civilization on the crux of this. 
Nash has been developing our civilization on this for 70 years.  I've just been reading his plans.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:09:51
No, but you are exactly on point.  
He showed all current methods cannot work.  Then said if we could calculate proper index's for reference in each nation then we COULD use that for currency stability.  In other words issuance would be properly tied to this type of production.
BUT...calculating the ideal basis is still A perfectly unsolvable problem that relies on the same issue: who selects the basket and how to determine what the ideal commodities are?
Here is the revelation:
You don't need to find the proper basket, but rather Nash only wants us to understand there is a significant relation between a proper basket and a currency that is SUPPOSED to represent it. 
That is too say, if a currency is favored by the markets, then this currency must necessarily represent its' basket well.
What we are seeing evolve is that each currency who's price begins lose on the markets is symptomatic of a currency that doesn't reflect a good relation ship between supply and underlying commodity value. 
The central banks are FORCED to issue intelligently.  Nash solved the trilemma by allowing monetary policy but forcing that policy to trend towards ideality.
Bitcoin's role is the benchmark, a good currency of decent quality (ie price is linked well to supply through cost of production) so that the beginning of such change takes place.

We might define capitalism as everyone's right to profit off of their own contribution and socialism as the belief that everyone should profit off an individuals creation. 
The worry is, if you take away the incentive to compete the overall collective result will be failure and inefficiency.

I appreciate your time, especially because it's kinda of lame to have to constantly deal with non-technical opinions.  It might be that I don't understand, and I can't really read math and technical language well.
But my gut tells me that you are not at all speaking to, for example, Jihan, who will not be happy with your proposal.  It seems when he tweeted about empty blocks he was alluding to this time when their advantage was discovered and that because it worked it was therefore allowed by the rules and therefore fair game.  We'll have to agree with him and he knew it. 
So we might suspect or expect that this group, predicting they will be exposed and a counter attack (your proposal) is inevitable.  So I'm thinking they would spread as much of their power (exploit) as far as they could in regard to setting up a a politically secure network of defense for when this time came.
You might not want to speak to it, but do I understand now that Lerner tried to mitigate this political battle with his proposal? Would be telling.
From Jihan's perspective, assuming it crushes the established profit model, this would be a declaration of war, no?
And so you propose, don't you, I understand, for the outcome that Neils Bohr proposed to the UN in regard to Atomic energy.  Let's choose a path in which the exploit gets to everyone so that no single entity holds this power. 
If I don't understand, perhaps its not important, if I do, you're not seeing this holistically which would make sense, because you are a core dev which has certain subjectivity implications.

yup, and that is clear.  So here is a better understanding of a point peoples like me and you can only get to in dialogue.  
I think what you point out would be suggested within such an intelligent network (ie "let's choose someone to BE satoshi")...
I don't think there is a mastermind, unless its Szabo or Nash.  Nash seems unlikely to be "satoshi", and Szabo has denied it vehemently. 
There just the obvious realization to me if you are someone like Satoshi or Szabo you would seek Nash...
and there is also the comparison of the block chain to the pyramids which suggests successive iterations and evolution as the real cause of the advent of both...
This then suggest that a group of mathematicians could not re-write math from the beginning...which I don't think Satoshi tried to do, or Szabo would agree could be done. 
Thanks I will look into that reference tho!

See each of these things can be mitigated.  For example in a poker hand a player doesn't likely die, just loses their connection.  Might come back in a later round of key use.  And if there are left SOME honest players then it still is fairly robust I think.

He already responded in his tweet when he explained he's going to exploit any rules he can and he will deem it moral.
If I understand well enough, its not a monopoly because places outside the patent law boundaries have a (covert) advantage over non jihan competitors who are inside jihan-patent covering borders.
Jihan gets the monopoly for the boundaries of his patent, but some other remote location ISN'T (necessarily) disadvantaged by this.
So it's not a monopoly that we would be avoiding, or better said, not NECESSARILY a monopoly.  If true it would suggest the proposal might not be founded. 
I wonder if you consider the possibility (and therefore the strategy lines) that Jihan (as a metaphor for "opposition to core") has all his bases covered to the point that none of the listed proposals he could block will ever go through.

You seem to have implied that a patent design needs to be leaked but as I understand (I don't really know much about patents) the idea is a patent gives design specifications. So doesn't having a patent make the design public?
I'm not sure the context of the rest of your post.  Are you saying the US team unknowingly leaked their patent to a Chinese company?
What I am asking is, if there is a covert implementation how does a patent block anyone from using it, because they will use it covertly and know one will know, so a patent can't hope to block such use no?

Thx.  This part is interesting to me.  There is some that might suggest capitalism is to ultimately function on the free market, with not government intervention.  Then I think there are those that will point out even Adam Smith believed in government regulation.  
Szabo seems to shed light on the understanding of the principle of least authority.  And so for this it might be that certain role of government in money might have made government unnecessary in some regard.
But also bitcoin does have its own governance model and protocols, so it might be said to simply be an evolution in that regard. A different plane of governance and with it a different paradigm.

No you can't guarantee it and you are making an assumption based on no economic theory or science. Irrational r/btc and BU supporters beliefs do not decide how the markets are to value something.

Segwit I dunno, but we will eventually use state channels which are allegedly lightning channels. 
You play the hands via text, with the threat of losing your escrow if the other players challenge your action (or inaction) AND you are found to be guilty. 
So the game runs ultra fast UNLESS someone actually tries to cheat the system, but since they ALWAYS are caught, the theory is no one every (rarely) cheats in this fashion (this is in regard to handing in keys NOT collusion).

I don't know if this is sort of dumbed down for the average person, but to me it goes against what Szabo writes and highlights.
If there is a debate as to whether the block size should be changed and what it should be changed to effect, then there is no argument that losing existing business should sway in this regard I think. An argument we need to adapt bitcoin to support some existing societal evolution is socialistic in nature imo.

I haven't added in all the links, quotes, and citations I have in mind which also help me clarify the accuracy.  The conclusion might be weak but I still wonder if its not valuable.  The basic idea is that with a market translator that Szabo designed b-money might actually be more relevant and viable from a human perspective in a future with multiple currencies, and possibly be useful for solving the problem of decentralizing id.

I think what the intelligent man I quote is pointing out is the problem wiki outlines assumes there must be a central bank.  The interesting thing is that bitcoin proves that this is simply a (false) axiom we were using that we didn't realize existed.

u/artofblocks sometimes you can tell when people haven't read Nash's argument for ideal money because they paraphrase him without mentioning it.
@_date: 2016-09-16 01:23:54
Yes but since each player holds and encryption key needed to see the hidden cards of any player and the deck...a player can hold their key from everyone in order to mess up an unfavorable situation.  You NEED everyone's keys at the end of the hand in order to guarantee the integrity of the game. 
So the basic idea is everyone puts in a large escrow and anyone that sways the game by not revealing a key loses their escrow to the other players.
@_date: 2016-09-16 02:02:19
Yup exactly, and so someone's internet could "crap out" at a perfect time to screw another player over.
It seems to me the interesting thing is the disconnection escrow could be provided like insurance by a 3rd party.  As they find honest players they won't mind providing the escrow on their behalf for a very small fee. 
Then players won't need to much money behind themselves. But forcing them to have more money to play (because of the escrow needed) sort of changes the psychology or the field of players because it means the would need to have a decent bankroll behind them.

I have many writings and its easy to search for them.
In  nutshell Nash explain bitcoin will cause our legacy fiat systems to stabilize in value.  Most bitcoiners think bitcoin we kill the banks and end fiat.  It's an ignorant viewpoint, ignorant of actual economic theory.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:55:50
I think you misunderstood why I asked you to summarize, it was for sincere readers that don't understand the technical details and so that its not just one person pointing out this agenda.  
So we have highlighted perfectly why everyone against core has an irrational argument and seems emotionally driven.  So where is the dialogue about how obvious nefarious players are, NOT trying to make bitcoin a low fee network, rather they are trying to clean all their stolen coins and its quite obvious and all the pieces fit that otherwise don't fit from this light.

It's a problem if u want Bitcoin to be a world currency, if people are holding and not spending, how can they also be spending? It's not a problem if u just want Bitcoin to rise in value but don't care that no one will spend it. This is first year economics, prob like first month.

I don't really wanna get into it with you (arguing etc.) but I question the sincerity here.  At the very least its frustrating not having a solid information source.  No idea if you are aware but this forum gets regularly attacked with ignorance of different sorts.  We just went through one where every other thread was an implication that China banned bitcoin.  There has not yet been a single source provided. 
And why do I get threatened with an exponentially long ban schedule for bringing awareness to it?
When I make a logical point and it gets deleted, I think that is a problem.  I am OBVIOUSLY sincere.  I OBVIOUSLY care.  
And I think that those that are deeming my posts to by immoral or not valuable are wrong.  I think they are using bad logic and making an unintelligent decision and I reject the assertion that pointing out this as a moderation problem is an attack or malicious in any regard.

He is the godfather of modern game theory, from insights when he was 25.  recently he was 70 or 80 and talking about ideal money, the result of the advent of a e currency with a stable supply.

It would be completely fake except for the fact that there are many exchanges around the world in many different countries and each has its own established prices.  If one exchange sort of "lies" and has a lower price (or higher) then people from other exchanges can sell or buy and make profit on the dishonest exchanges. 
Once people move to take advantage of the differing prices the "deal" starts to fade and the price on the dishonest exchange begins to stabilize in comparison to all the other exchanges. 
The prices are not perfectly matched around the world but they are close.  So your friend in your example would quoting either a certain exchanges pricing, or a website that does an average of many or all the exchanges. 
  click buttons on this site and learn.
take a look at the different exchanges associated with bitcoin around the world: 
Note the chinese exchange prices are lower right now because of changes in regulation and other rumours:

There is no closure fears.  I think rather the chinese miners and government are getting ready to pump BCH and so they are pulling equity out of bitcoin and the alts and disguising it with FUD in the news.
No government would ever block its citizens in this way, especially of the major nations.  It would cause the exchange rate to skyrocket if there was only a black market for it.

You functioning on the tacit assumption that a money that is transacted more necessarily increases in value.  Its completely unfounded.
Bitcoin has an international valuation, which means regardless of its chinese price, it has a value that does not go down because of one nations perspective on it. 
When that value is harder to procure in regard to exchanging an inflating currency, its dearness does not wane. 
It is dear for the reason that it is internationally valuated an all citizens seek an inflation hedge for savings.

No see you can theorize something would be stable, which is money perfectly pegged to an optimal basket of commodities prices (international).  the problem is there is no such political solution for implementation.  
But if we flip that observation on its head....
We can say IF fait were forced to compete with a currency that had a fairly predictable supply, then as fiat improves it would  eventually reach a ceiling of perfect stability...

The common denominator among all of the nefarious or disingenuous or ignorant players is that they all won't low fees. I have not had someone with technical expertise properly explain to me, but I am guessing that anyone with stolen coins wants low fees and this is because they need a higher magnitude of transactions to wash a smaller subset of coins. 
I suspect the chinese have coins these cannot declare publically because they stole them.  Same with Ver.  Wright and some exchanges.  
And yes bch carries forward the asicboost advantage it seems.  There would be other governments with coins they want washed.  And so all these groups would implicitly collude and for anyone that needs to wash coins in order to claim them would be willing to throw an impossible hail mary.

John Nash spent 20 years explaining how an international ecurrency with a stable supply would take control from central banks and governments to arbitrarily print money. 
Nonetheless, if bitcoin is to arise, then no government will want to miss out. Its not about the people its about power in regard to the war of nations.

Yes we have never really been on a gold standard.  
Its not a point of no return, Nash argues, with the introduction of an internationally accessible option with a comparable value proposition to gold this would force banks to use such a metric as a barometer for inflation targeting.

I myself think that John Nash had this debate with himself for 20 years, and left if for us to sift through for the purpose of understanding exactly why what SEEMS intuitive and obvious is actually the wrong answer.

@_date: 2015-09-16 04:27:45
You are rational.  You should hear me out further then.  I am suggesting we can have consensus for change but NOT to change the "implied" future utility of bitcoin.  The "implied future utility of bitcoin", as it stands today, because of the 1mb block size is that eventually blocks will fill and transaction fees will sort the mess, and a settlement layer will result.
So I do think, that small changes will be made to facilitate this.  But I suspect that bitcoin will not be made to scale to a world currency where peoples are buying coffee. You might not agree still, but lets be careful to understand what I am saying.
And I don't think all open source/consensus projects are doomed. I think satoshi HAD to put a limit on (1mb) in the past, and very quickly realized that the limit would likely not be scaled to the degree the general public would demand.  And I also think he decided, intuited, and extrapolated the realization that bitcoin as a settlement layer is ideal.
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:05:48
Satoshi SAID this, but as I quoted peoples at that time begging him not to set the limit, the implication of the limit itself was that in the future without change the system would be rendered digital gold.
Bitcoin is not supposed to have a social contract, it is supposed to be free from this society cannot break or corrupt it.

Yes in poker a TTP equates to a lower profitability for the player. A security leak equates to a cost for the player.  Poker sites function like banks, and so to be successful they must be ultra secure.  SWC has already been shut down and the owner charged.

It was SAID that is the reason.  But the other REALITY, is that Satoshi OBVIOUSLY knew that changing the gap would get more and more difficult over time.  And when people protested the 1mb cap, because they knew it would be hard to change...he ignored them.

I can validate it "kind of implies that it should be done".  But it does not suggest this was for sure the plan.  And I would like to suggest the opposite, rather Satoshi ignored the debate from the very beginning on purpose, to make 1mb VERY difficult to change.
It makes perfect sense to anyone not completely jaded by their own interest in scaling bitcoin to visa.

You are talking about bitcoin as a payment system.  Bitcoin for what it is, for what was written about it many years ago, for a different purpose than you have in mind is something no bank can create.
Lol'n is just a symptom of ignorance, lack of knowledge.  Poker playes face this same paradox.  NO business model can do what the players can do for the themselves if they have a p2p implementation of poker.

@_date: 2015-09-15 06:20:07
From what I have read and researched specifically on how the 1mb limit was set, what I can see is that Satoshi purposefully side stepped these comments:
Regardless of what this community wants to believe, Satoshi seemingly NEVER **explicitly** said that bitcoin was going to be a system comparable to Visa (and NO the opening of bitcoin.pdf does not verify such a claim either!).  Explicit is the key word here, because there is nothing explicit it and even the people quoted above immediately recognized the issue that would arise in the future.
The issue they recognized wasn't that block size would need to be scaled, what they realized was the change would be much harder in the future.
Satoshi then clearly knew this, and so clearly there is the implication that Satoshi did not want a system that could compromise its own initial security setting easily, which includes the 1mb block limit.
This is obvious, but we choose to fail to see it.
@_date: 2015-09-04 04:46:47

Again and to be clear.  I HAVE read TWON, and I'm getting the impression you haven't.  I have a fairly decent understanding of it too.  
Amending the constitution is fine, but I talked about not being able to change THE FUNDAMENTAL FRAMEWORK which is EXACTLY the purpose of the constitution and the genius behind its creation. Guess where I get analogue from?  Nick Szabo: 


No its not my confusion, its the assumption.  "Consensus" being short for, whatever the X% needed for agreeing is. You need X amount of consensus for change, and when you have multiple parties that want multiple things, you are going to end up with no change, because no consensus. And to be clear, again, by consensus, I don't mean 100%, or 90%, or any % you don't agree with...
I'm talking about the ACTUAL required % to ACTUALLY change the 1mb cap.  I think it might get "changed" but I don't at all believe yet that it will significantly alter the future/implied utility of bitcoin.

No, what you missed is my post somewhere downvoted below with links to posters asking him not to set the 1mb limit because it would OBVIOUSLY be difficult and more and more so to change as time went by. Satoshi OBVIOUSLY knew this, especially since other posters immediately identified this. So there is seemingly the obvious realization here that he was being smug to some extent, when people said "hey this going to be difficult to change" and not only did he not care, he didn't reply.
As for evidence, I am talking about reality.  Not hypothetical reality but today's reality.  Look at the block size limit, it is 1mb.  Look at the consensus, it is NON existent. I am talking about reality.

In regards to extending lightning channel’s to the philosophy of p2p poker we are left with the problem of disencentiving habitual “floor callers”, that is the peoples that choose to run the equity of their hand and not adhere to the game flow.
So there is then incentive for them, especially considering variance, to make this move in certain spots, and so the punishment, in some form or another simply needs to equal this incentive (or be worse).
In live poker we might see how this could be solved, where someone is calling the floor excessively, then the Casino might not let that person back, might give them a waiting period, might take away some floor calling privileges, might charge a tax/rake/fee or penalty and so on.
Further more and in regards to that, we might choose a centralized authority, which itself could be either minimized or better yet divided into many decentralized (competing) authorities.
But it might also be solvable on its own by algorithm.
If a player pool has an average of spots in which the floor is called, it might be possible to track each players # of times they call (as a frequency vs time).
We can think of a simple tiered system in which those that are involved in “floor calling” move down a spot, thus pushing up less controversial players on average.
It can be made either costly and/or time consuming to move up in a tier from various ways such as rake, fees, points accumulated, shares, etc.
Some form of finite accounts or finite seats/tables, could be used to create a value that is desired to not be destroyed.
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:58:30
I am simply pointing out how obvious it was to even other people at the time that this difficult debate would arise.  And suggesting this implies, Satoshi, being far smarter than the average person (3 people made this realization), knew that this difficulty would arise as well.
This all seems quite, simple, and quite obvious.  I does not however, fit with peoples view that satoshi explicitly wanted bitcoin to scale to visa. He simply didn't state that.
I am pointing to proof and reality.
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:03:03
Ideal Money is a lecture that is a proposal by John Nash. It is a very interesting proposal that goes through the philosophical basis for what Nash suggests could be asymptotically ideal money.
The proposal is of a stably issued electronic money with an ever decreasing money supply.  He defines "ideal" in this lecture and then explains why the money he is alluding to will become asymptotically ideal.
The proposal is for the introduction of a new gold standard that will cause all of the centrally issued currencies to have to compete in relation to it.  
Because we were missing such a barometer historically (well gold failed eventually for reasons he outlined) we were not able to use the market to brute force what is ideal.  
You cannot engineer ideal, because the ever evolving markets will always beat your forseight.  That is what reality means.
But you CAN construct a basis point for evaluating change.  But that basis point must NEVER evolve or change, or threaten to change. It must be stable in that context.
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:02:41
I'll need to look into this a little bit more, but if the best you can do as a malicious player is cause the equity in the hand to be paid out, you don't have much incentive to do such a thing.  So if there is an invite only table, and you have to pay some cost or work your way up a ladder to get there, then it's not economically feasible to make these attacks.
So I think you are right, and we are on the same page, but keep in mind, you can also get kicked of a table or out of the casino, which can be expensive to get back in or difficult to get a reputation.  
So there is still a "leak" in the solution, but quite quantifiable and customizably solvable from this perspective I think.
@_date: 2015-09-28 17:35:30
Actually you do want the money supply to change depending on what you are creating.  The correction to your thoughts is that we want the purchasing power of money to stay stable not NECESSARILY the supply.
In regards to a meter or the mass of a gram, or a watt etc. such things have already been considered and explained:




bitcoin's finite supply has a different purpose in this regard but also the finiteness is somewhat only psychologically appealing.
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:28:48
Bitcoin loses SOME functionality when blocks are full, but it still remains an expensive payment network.  bitcoin as a payment network that scales to visa is not at all the only reasons it can and might store value.  I don't settle my balances in gold, or usd, I use CAD...nor do i expect to be doing this with bitcoin in the future.  
You make my points just fine for me.  I seem to see the future of bitocin as a digital gold, not a digital usd. 
bitcoin cannot handle everything, and I don't subscribe to the belief that it will evolve to handle everything.  I think Satoshi decided that a long time ago, and we are having difficultly facing the truth of it. 


You are discussing a reality we are not yet privy too.
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:35:34

@_date: 2015-09-26 20:24:19
Yes, but keeping with rational emotionally stable dialog, we all expect bitcoin "to scale", but it cannot then imply that bitcoin must scale to, for example, visa.  Or in other words bitcoin having favorable "scalability" doesn't necessarily imply bitcoin become a payment network rather than a digital gold. 
We cannot argue that bitcoin as a digital gold doesn't imply bitcoin cannot be a payment network. 
We might try to argue bitcoin as a digital gold will kill bitcoin.  But I think truthfully it only "kills" bitcoin as a payment network, which is only one possible use case.
@_date: 2015-09-15 17:38:11
Ah.  No Satoshi is too smart to be the "maintainer" when the whole purpose of the design is not to have a single centralized authority. Yes given Satoshi is a pseudonym, its quite clear their was intent to disappear (ie not be found).
I can't have a reasonable discussion with someone who questions whether or not Satoshi intended on giving up control of the project. 
Everything contingent on Satoshi was not at all his plan. That would be the opposite of the purpose of bitcoin.
So you can really understand what I am saying here.  No intelligent Satoshi would hope in the future block size could be willingly changed by ANYONE.  Otherwise political and economic pressure would control and therefore centralize the power to control bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:51:06
If you think of it like a Casino, with multiple floors.  Everytime players in a hand choose this route the players involved get kicked down a floor.  With random seating in each floor AND sufficient amount of competition (ie decentralized player pool, not all bots owned by one entity! you will "sift" out the reneging/floor calling players.
There can be a time, or a cost to move up in floors, and benefits like lower rake at higher floors, or simply the benefit of a secure game at higher floors.
Or with a limited entry say only x amount of customers allowed in the casino, there could be a cost associated with each account.

Now you are sidestepping obvious reality. It is not AT ALL easy to change this limit.  You are fooling yourself if you can't see this.  And it was pointed out immediately by 3 others the obvious truth of that.
Satoshi cannot hand wave and make such truth invalid.  This great debate was foreknowledge, not by Satoshi, but by those that pleaded with him not to enforce such a limit.
I point to the reality and gravity of the situation, and the obvious foreknowledge of it many peoples had. It DOES exist and one cannot deny it.
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:41:38
I'm not sure what you said here.  If we remember there is in fact a letter that went around where at the end of it "Satoshi" admitted if this is how bitcoin is to evolve then he clearly failed (addressing hearn and gavins proposal as an attack on success)...
But then you say something I agree with, Satoshi design it to evolve into something in which there is not power to attack it successfully, this may or may not have come to fruition, but it is clearly the core principle of the design.

Digital Gold is the enthymeme of "Ideal Money".
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:30:12
LN is a pretty basic solution.  Theoretically I'd guess its accepted as sound, just the implementation might have "bugs".  But I think we are missing the point.  "Bloating the money supply" I think you mean bloating the available transactions "space", or choke points, or restrictions, is what I think Szabo is suggesting is acceptable.
Trying to solve the "bloat" is what he seems to be suggesting is futile, paypay and visa did that...
bitcoin "bloated" is a new thing that has another use you don't seem to be considering.
@_date: 2015-09-27 01:42:54
sure, then you can understand why bitcoin COULD hold value as a costly (but cheaper and way better than gold!), but still not function cheaply as a payment system.  So then "paper gold" as you call it might be off chain solutions, but that are far more "secure" than the traditional paper gold you mock.
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:19:35
I want to know what John Nash's lecture Ideal Money had to do with the advent of bitcoin.  The papers are so extremely related it is a very very curious observation.
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:07:05
I'd agree to some extent, but I urge you to consider the possibility.  It is not a stretch.  What IS a stretch is many peoples saying Satoshi explicitly said he wanted bitcoin to scale to Visa.  There are no such statements, nothing direct, only implications. 
There is definitely then the reasonable and rational possibility, that 1mb blocks were necessary and that the idea was to let the system get "stable" before truly having the debate that bitcoin should not scale to visa (it should scale, but not as a coffee payment system).
It would be a heavy burden but necessary, to realize you must be the person to bear that bad news or implementation of a decision that affects the nature of that which we are to share (world money). But arguing about it at that time would have likely caused the project to stall and fail.  Bitcoin is strong because a great man or great men worked very fast to bootstrap something that protects itself from all our follies and greed.  It can't be everything but it is the security utility that has the quality known to man.  
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:20:26


Lets hear it?
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:47:58
Then you of few people can understand Nash's point here:


 &gt;   It is only really respectable that there should not be an arbitrary or capricious pattern of inflation, but how should a proper and desirable form of money value stability be defined?








@_date: 2015-09-27 01:39:59
I think the world is vastly different in that future but I think if you scrutinize Nash's lecture series ideal money you will see that is exactly the picture he painted and proposed.
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:06:51
What you are saying that isn't true is exactly declared by Oleg, and seemingly supported by Szabo.  We call that argument from "authority" but here I think authority isn't the unfavorable "appointed" type but rather the knowledge authority person we seek because logic.
I write articles like this: 
and this: 
That generally and specifically highlight the entire proposal which I think is used to make the basis that this world needs a digital gold.  
As for what you asking for specifically the separation of the two is what allows for ideal money to evolved since it entirely has to do with solving the problem of a settlement mechanism between nations that is politically uncorreptable.  Historically gold has served as this but has failed for some reasons:










Bitcoin doesn't fail as hard for these reasons.  
Bitcoin as a scalable payment network doesn't fit the use because changing the scale to much such a thing creates and instability of cost of using bitcoin in relation to the available bitcoins. You can't continue to change the nature or the markets cannot find confidence in it.  
And for example perhaps it COULD scale but we must decide the algorithms soon because change gets more difficult with addoption.  
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:33:35
Agreed, except the part that we are today in fact facing a reality of it, until it can be proved that we can in fact come to the consensus that we are to deviate. 
So I do agree, I am simply pointing out obvious reality, but also the obvious foreknowledge we had for this reality as an outcome of 1mb. 
You are right though, perhaps Satoshi was blind to what 3 posters pointed out.  Or perhaps he told them it wouldn't matter (even though it does). 
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:35:18
Before I explain how you are misunderstanding everything.  I want to ask if you have read Adam Smith's works, and particularly "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" because you are referring to it, and I am quite tired of peoples quoting and referencing works they are not actually at all familiar with.
You see, what you are saying is the evidence that supports my point, but you are using it to support the opposite of my point.  
Consensus on a large scale for change in regards to a large population is ALWAYS very difficult if not impossible.  
Look at gun debate, look at freedom for different minorities or religions, abortion etc.  The ENTIRE constitution and American governence system is held up by the fact that the peoples cannot come to enough consensus to change the framework.  That framework will stand the test of time because you will never get the entire American population (large majority albeit not 100% is needed) to agree to change these things. 
So you and others miss the beauty of what creates security for bitcoin, it is exactly the division of interests, that makes consensus that significantly changes the implied nature of bitcoin impossible. 
If your premise and conclusion is that consensus on a massive scale is easy you are not at all observing reality. We wouldn't need gold or bitcoin if this were true.  You are defeating the entire purpose of TWON, and I MUST MUST MUST think there is NO WAY you have taken the time to read it.

What we are talking about here is game theory, and there are plenty of instances in game theory where players cannot realize there optimal pay-offs because the game is too complex for them to reach a cooperative solution that pays more than non-cooperative solutions. 
Completely standard.
@_date: 2015-09-15 05:11:32
Thanks, I think we can solve collusion by having a profitability standard (which is hypothetical for this paragraph).  This suggest bots will arise to suck up the profit, and also that hardware and software will evolve for this use.  Essentially its somewhat like a proof of work with playing poker as the puzzle. 
Then you can essentially pay these players to act as nodes on the network to validate transactions that do hit the poker block chain (whether its bitcoin or poker or a hybrid).  
Then you also have a public casino and private games.  The public casino is random seating which non serious poker players (who don't get invited to private games).  **The random seating protects the players from collusion PROVIDED the bot/node pools are decentralized as well.**  The greatest incentive here is that no one will play in an untrustworthy node pool population environment. 
And so there comes some comparability to the economics of bitcoin in relation to decentralizing the participants and mining/verification.  And then with a bottom layer of public decentralized (randomly seated) tables, there can be levated an upper level of private games that pays a fee to the lower level to hold up the private level games.

Satoshi proposes a payment network, not the services to use it.  So first things first you create an applicable infrastructure that allows for free market innovation of new poker site solutions.

Satoshi’s Choice: Decoding Bitcoin’s Money Supply: 
It seems there is some lower limit needed in regards to divisibility otherwise it could not serve the function of money.  2 coins wouldn't serve a population well, but in most regards 1 million vs 10 million would function similarly for a 'small' community. 
An infinite supply might be psychologically unfavorable and difficult to make contracts vs without some form of a limit.
So it seems the limits here are quite psychological as long as there is some form of finiteness.  The divisibility probably simply has a diminishing usefulness.  Good is probably good enough.

There real interesting paper here that you and only a few others might truly appreciate is "ideal poker" 
You must understand I took Dr. Nash's lecture "Ideal Money" and re wrote it only in terms of poker, and the implementation of mental poker is exactly what it outlines.  
In other words Nash's lecture is about the end of central banking because of the advent of a stabley issued currency no government controls.  Ideal Poker is about the equivalent but in regards to centrally issued chips (ie server models).
My argument is poker players will decentralized their industry before the banking industry changes because we are collective game theorists.
So I think ideal poker or p2p poker is actually the next great technology (after ethereum/smart contracts).

Ha, its not bad logic its the same logic as many of the top computer scientists are pointing to.  The entire point is bitcoin doesn't become a digital gold until blocks fill up and then the resources (transactions) becomes scarce (or costly whichever view you want to have).  


This is EXACTLY why we are having the debate and you are late to h party.  Your example here doesn't solve the debate, you are describing exactly what will cause bitcoin today (as a payment system), to become a digital gold tomorrow (as a "costly" payment system).
Now you can understand why there is an argument in the first place!

Yes but he didn't at all explicitly suggest a change in the nature of project by the way of changing block size.  Thats not me twisting things.  Every person that alludes to this is twisting it.  
Bitcoin seemingly needs to scale, but there are not quotes anything near "My plan is to change block size in the future to support visa size".
its not like that, its clearly not like that...and people protested when he set 1mb, and he clearly ignored the obvious difficulties of such change for the future.

Not at all "explicitly". NOT WHATSOEVER.  Thats why this debate exists.

And the conclusion:




 &gt;I see this as analogous to how the PSFTCIAFBIDOJ were claiming to provide something much better than Ponzi schemes that they could not deny existed in all other sites. But in the end the “dictatorship of the proletariat” seemed to become rather exposed as simply the dictatorship of the regime. So there may be an analogy to this as regards those called “PSFTCIAFBIDOJ” in that while they have claimed to be operating for high and noble objectives of general poker welfare what is clearly true is that they have made it easier for their sites to “print money". 


@_date: 2015-09-17 19:56:01


The bitcoin.pdf does not explicitly say bitcoin is to be a p2p digital cash system.  The opening statement simply points out the value of a such an advancement that doesn't do through a 3rd party.   


But clearly if only a settlement layer, we cannot simply say a btc user NEEDS to go through a bank.  They can still transact and pay a higher cost for it.  But moreover many entities will transact and pay a LOWER cost vs the tech they have available for such transactions today. 


But such a thing does not exist.


It's true, but I have lost faith in nxt along time ago, bitcoin is real.
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:12:40
Satoshi never said he wanted to raise the block size to scale to visa.  He just said it COULD be done.  Everyone at the time 1mb was set, said "why are you doing this, it will be near impossible to change in the future'...Satoshi didn't respond.

You are referring to the history of gold and wealth which was well documented by Adam Smith.  Gold was not always the store, but evolved that way for certain reasons, and in some ways we have evolved beyond gold for this.  Gold was made as coins but for various reasons gold fell out of favor.  This is also well pointed out by Nash is "ideal money" which is lecture that uses this exact observation as a basis for why the world needs a new gold.

Think of costly transactions as more scarcity.  So creating a "backlog" pushes the fee up to a market imposes limit and the suggestion is that this would cause bitcoin to be scarce in the sense of use. 
I can't comment on the paper, I don't know how accepted it is, its to new especially to me, but I consider it and try to read them the best I can. 
When bitcoin cannot handle everyday transactions because of cost, it is still valuable to securely transfer mass amounts of wealth. This is how it is forced, depending on the circumstances to act like a high value settlement layer.

It is the point that the average joe won't use bitcoin for daily purposes.  But they certainly remain free to do so.  Again we are suggesting the value doesn't come from average joe.  Bitcoin as a digital gold is not supposed to be, or defined as by ideal money.  But there is possibility of the levation of bitcoin as a valueable transferable utility for other reasons than the average joe.
We cannot keep repeating the circular argument that only average joe can make bitcoin valuable because it must therefore be a currency.
Nash was talking about a currency system based on a Keynesian (centralized banked) controlled supply, basically the effects of leaving the bretton woods system and why it happened and how we can evolve to have a new standard that brings about a new stability.
Bitcoin, I have argued extensively, serves the purpose of what Nash has perfectly outlined as the thing that will bring about ideal money.  I argue Nash proposed bitcoin be digital gold, and not a payment system for the average joe...and that ideal money will then automatically only be printed in relation to digital gold. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:01:16
no not decades.  years for sure, take it from someone that is well studied on the subject.  I have given an extensive argument for this on thewealthofchips.  Poker players are going to be the catalyst for bitcoin because of the relationship of ideal poker to john nash's ideal money.  Nash is a hero to poker players, he is the founder of the equilibrium strategy that is the balance point for all play.  Any serious pro uses the term "nash" many times everyday.
@_date: 2015-09-16 04:46:50
As I understand there are 5 key developers that have some form of higher authority, which seems to be perfectly in line with writings by Szabo about how to best decentralize power.


By that logic if we have 1mb block sizes now, bigger blocks were never intended.  
Bitcoin started out centralized, and certain parts have become decentralized, and hopefully more and more layers.There is nothing that says it rains today so it must rain tomorrow.

Well I think there is an argument, at least at first, if bitcoin functions TOO well as gold then everyone will hoard it.  So then there is reason to "inflate" the "currency" at some ultimately decreasing rate.  As I understand it, nash terms this "asymptotically" ideal money.
@_date: 2015-09-27 17:25:37
Sure.  The point is it is outside of the scope of the software needed. You don't solve this like satoshi didn't solve wallet providers.  You provide the necessary code to sustain an infrastructure for mental poker and let the "businesses" or "sites" create solutions that serve the customers around that infrastructure.
It is wrong to site sybil attack here.  The sybil attack that needs to be solved is in relation to bot pools/network nodes.  Not in regards to player collusion.

gold isn't valuable because of its use as a cash.  Sure you can say its not the bitcoin.pdf vision, but bitcoin as a digital gold is truly the most valuable in terms of price and what bitcoin could buy.  So in that case you would want to disagree but still keep your coins.
If we think bitcoin can only be valuable as a cash then we are ignore the genius of nash and basic economics.

I agree there will always be cases for on-altchain.  But bitcoin has another competitive advantage that it is first.  It also has a possible advantage that the underlying nature will NEVER change.  We need that, whether it is bitcoin or not.  
 &gt;This contrasts with gold which has an inherent competitive advantage due to its unique scarcity.
bitcoin too has this unique scarcity, and again I can make Nash's points about gold more relevant:














But also just as relevant is Nick Szabo on mining underwater: 


Its not just me that is making the mistake you claim, but seemingly some of the brightest minds in computer science.  I am trying to suggest perhaps the view I propose and share (from the tweet) is the correct view.  That we cannot have our cake and eat it too.  
As for "more transaction fees paid"  its just another way of organizing the debate.  Bitcoin can have value either from a high value high cost settlement network OR a low cost high transaction payment system.  The debate exists because it cannot be both.  
Gold is not actually nearly as scarce as bitcoin in this context, it is just that its economic relation to technology has kept it so.  So "scarcity" really itself is a changing perspective.  Scarcity too, or the purpose of it changes with the implied nature of the block size.  But the purpose of "scarcity" is really about the predictability of mining, and constantly changing the parameters of bitcoin is an attack on such stability imo. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:27:52
I think you and 300+ people are confused.  Satoshi set 1mb, knowing it would be impossible or exponentially impossible to change it in the future.  
Somewhere in this thread I linked to other posters in 2010 asking Satoshi not to set this limit because even THEY knew it would obviously amount to this difficult to debate.
YOU think Satoshi ignored them because he was sloppy, careless, busy, disinterested...i don't know...
I think he ignored them because he didn't want to have the debate until the network was so big and decentralized that even he couldn't change things.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:49:50
Sure, so there is clear choices here, we can raise the block to be either a settlement network, OR a payment network.  And need to think about the ramifications of either.
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:25:47
Yes but if we think about evolution, there was a period when satoshi could change things at will, and decide them.  But if his vision and design worked, even his own will and control would be lost to the masses.  And if that worked it seems to me his foresight was that eventually getting the masses to cooperate would also be impossible...
So if you can follow that, then you can see Satoshi had a good reason to believe 1mb would stick forever.
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:13:34
Gold is used for a store and transporter of GREAT wealth, that is its main use, and the argument by I think me Oleg, and Szabo Nash etc. is that bitcoin COULD be used for this, and it would have great value for this as well.
@_date: 2015-09-27 00:45:04
It works.  The relevant point is that, you only need the blockchain IF someone cheats, but there is no incentive to cheat because you will ALWAYS get caught and have to pay anyways.  So in the simple example you don't use the block chain but you NEED the block chain ;p

Yes but in this context we are referring to bitcoin as a gold, which in that case the unchanging nature and it being first of its kind is what is likely to keep it on top in this respect.
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:45:59
Yes all that can change, yet we still don't necessarily need to change the key/core parameters such as block size.  Not so much that we fundamentally change bitcoin's utility.

The simply answer in relation to what you point out is "cost".  This is the exact point you don't seem to know yet.  You would be correct about 21 million limit being the thing that makes bitcoin like gold, BUT if you mess with the nature of bitcoin as a result of different block sizes, you will find that smaller blocks cause bitcoin to act like a high value settlement system with high cost to transact (ie digital gold!), and if you have large or infinite blocks you allow bitcoin to flourish as a payment system (centralized mining) but you lose the property bitcoin could share with gold.
We NEED a digital gold, we need gold 2.0...its just the community is not educated on the subject.

It is a social contract in its existence and needs a social consensus to change which is only ever monitored by what the network actually consists of.  It is one man's dream (or a group under a moniker) that set the initial parameters and it is "free market" to usurp that decision but the markets are not freer because of such change happening.
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:30:58
What I have been saying is the next few posts are "average" people that point out how obviously difficult it will be to change.  Peoples argue and beg satoshi not to put the limit and satoshi ignores.
there is the possibility then that satoshi knew no one would agree with him, so he did it and didn't explain. 
Then he innocuously explains it CAN and COULD be changed in the future. 
I'm being objective, I came to this objectively, and rationally.  I think you and others don't have any idea why your view isn't obvious, I think you and others don't even know why there is a debate.  I think you and others think that people who think bitcoin is most useful as a digital gold are uneducated and uninformed peoples.  
but it seems to me those that are most informed are proposing just exactly that.  It  seems Satoshi chose exactly that even while people protested him doing so. You are going with what Satoshi seemed imply, and with what the popular undereducated masses want Satoshi to have said...
but the simply truth is he didn't at all explicitly say bitcoin SHOULD scale to Visa, there was no such vision said, "a p2p e cash system" does not explicitly does this either. Its not there, and that is why there is this debate...
but there is a very important lecture on how to bring about ideal money, and what this world needs, by John Nash, a very very relevant and intelligent man, who spent many years talking about this exact subject of needing a gold 2.0.
presently we ignore his works and genius and thesis.

Ah yes!  I usually mean to write "not changing the implied nature of bitcoin's utility." which is a cop out you see?  It suggests that the implied nature is that bitcoin stars as a money but eventually evolves into a digital gold.  I think Satoshi knew that, and planned it, and didn't tell anyone because he knew they wouldn't agree with the 1mb limit then.

Yet it hold all the value from the historical benefit of our specialization of labor functions.

This seems quite obvious to me that forking contention in this context is simply a part of bitcoin that has not yet found an equilibrium.  99% of peoples here are too emotionally involved to understand what I said and mean, which is simply that it is FAR easier to defeat a consensus than to make one. 
Or, and in other words, predicting an actual hard fork is probably absolutely impossible, but showing the math to suggest that attaining consensus for a fork is impossible at this point seems incredibly easy.  At least not a fork that significantly changes the nature of the future of bitcoin.
If you have 4 proposals, and depending on the major players, that are favored by 25% of the significant voters, and each voters refuses to allow contrasting proposal to gain majority, it seems to me that consensus would be impossible. 
Adding proposals increases the fragmentation, it doesn't help things.  And the last piece is that knowing there won't be a consensus causes each of the 4 x 25%er's (im sure even less division is needed) to weigh the possibility of cooperating with another proposal vs for example no consensus (1mb).
So provided there is a Nash equilibrium in which there can be no unilateral gain, you have an incredibly stable situation that can only be changed through complex cooperative action which would be provided empirically at this time we are not capable of. 
I think me and Satoshi wanted this, not sure if anyone else sees value here.

Firstly I played pro poker for the last four years.  You use of the word "odds" is not correct.  You cannot say "out of all the possibilities what are the chances 1 mb is correct".  Probability theory doesn't work that way.  What we are saying is easy to understand and there is no need to twist what a child could understand.  A finite block size is needed, and not at all necessarily one that scale's bitcoin's usability to visa.  No one said zero blocks, and satoshi did in fact pick the legacy 1mb for a reasons not by random choice.
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:29:59
Whats funny is the exact opposite is true.  What happened in reality in that conversation is Satoshi had previous added a 1mb cap, and said "don't worry we can change it to match visa in the fututre"  then a couple posters objected and said, "hey wait a minute don't put 1mb, thats gonna be difficult to change in the future" ...
Satoshi didn't respond, and my suggestion is he is laughing at people who don't realize what he did, he doomed the project to small blocks purposefully imo.
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:42:34
I said two things there, 1) Satoshi is too smart to be the "maintainer" and 2) the whole purpose of the design is not to have centralized authority.

@_date: 2015-09-16 00:39:28
No what was obvious was that putting the 1mb on then would make it very difficult to lift in the future.  We know its obvious because multiple posters immediately pointed this out. If he wanted to very easily change it in the future, then clearly there was not more important task at the time than to address this issue...
suggesting he didn't have time, or didn't know or understand, is really what would be not at all obvious I would think.
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:33:10
There is another more interesting argument.  That defines the most ideal reference point for what we should relate a currency to in regards to "debasement".  If you think about it, "inflation" is quite arbitrary unless that is some standard to measure it too right?
Bitcoin, in the context suggested by the proposal of ideal money, is a strong favorable standard that will enact change, because the monetary supply is PREDICTABLE in regards to the cost of production.  
Bitcoin is not perfect in this way but it is better than other comparable commodities.  For example gold has historically been favored for this. 
Then money that can't be debased, in regards to what would be an IDEAL reference point (better than bitcoin!), would NATURALLY evolve through competition on the markets.  
In other words, let's not expect bitcoin to be our ideal currency, let's not try to force it to be.  That is not its ideal purpose.  There is something else the world needs.

The way I write.  When I say, "you think im dumb", it doesn't need you to come back and say "no its not true". It means the part you think I don't understand is not the part I don't understand.  So as a clue we can move on to other "semantics".  
When I say "consensus", I am talking about whatever significant majority is needed for change. 
But I don't agree with the "ease" of what you suggest.  Think of more friction, more disagreement, and a much much slower process.  Plus an increasing realization by the frenzy mob here of uneducated people, who will slowly realize that having a consensus on large visa scalable blocks is not at all desirable for the sustained and secure longevity of the project. 
Have you read all the posts by people saying "I don't understand why there is a debate, lets just raise the blocks".  Other people think the debate is fine, only if we are decided which big block proposal to use.  
Other people say things like, if Satoshi wanted 1mb block he would have chosen that size.  Do you see how silly these thoughts are?
Basically this: If the community can and does make rash, quick, and large or widesweeping changes to bitcoin, and especially those that make changes to the nature, without GREAT consideration...we should consider the entire project unstable.  There would be no security in that, and bitcoin would not be a useful money or settlement layer.
This "consensus" mechanism, is not the free democracy the general pop wants it to be, that magically makes the majority the intelligent peoples (and therefore bitcoin should bend to their ideas and will).  The consensus mech. rather is exactly what makes it difficult for ANY group to have control of the parameters and to change them at will.  MANY MANY peoples here have that backwards. And yes the American government works like that too, which is why many people think the American gov cannot get anything done, they fail to see the benefit of that difficult from the peoples perspective.

I don't think it does.  And when Ver says we need to fix bitcoin so more people can make transactions and the price can go up I think he doesn't understand monetary theory.  If there is a positive expectation to bitcoin's price this incentivizes hoarding.  I think then it puts pressure on the velocity of other currencies and naturally lowers their value without government intervention.

@_date: 2015-09-17 20:44:52
Right but the context of the OP is that bitcoin functions fine as a coffee money in regards to cost TODAY, but the question of block size is because of the future implication (as it stands ie 1mb blocks) that bitcoin will be a high cost transact-able commodity.
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:14:37
Yes but when you are talking about increasing entropy probably at some exponentially pace (ie adoption), we are really understating when we say 'hard'. In reality its probably the hardest thing in the universe to get a substantial portion of the human population to agree on the direction bitcoin should go.
Basically I am says the whole crux of the security is based on the fact the the community will fight and not cooperate. 
Or in other words it seems scientifically obvious that such a consensus to change the implied nature of bitcoin is exactly TOO hard.
Whereas you are suggesting, somehow, that your subjective belief that "hard" means "easy", or completely achievable has meritt regardless of the observable reality (ie blocksize IS at 1mb, and there is NO growing consensus for change.
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:24:28
I quoted the posts, I refer to them. They talk about what COULD be done.  But they are not at all explicit in this regard.  Again, if its so explicit, then why does this debate exist?  
You still don't know why this debate exists I think. Do you think its just me that holds it back?  My attitude that bitcoin should not necessarily be scaled to be a coffee payment system is not what is causing the debate to exist.
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:11:04
I'm not completely arguing you, I can agree to some extent.  But I think you have missed the purpose of the debate, and the difficulty of it.  I think what we are realizing is that bitcoin, given present technology and knowledge MUST choose between one or the other.  Whether or not we can achieve these things you speak of by 2044 I don't know, but its all plausible.  Yet the ability to choose and change bitcoin in the capacity of block size is fading. 
And don't forget, there may only be one way to preserve the digital gold aspect of bitcoin, and that could be by not evolving the block size to scale in regards to on chain transactions.  Consider.
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:18:10


That is your idea, not something that any intelligent and rationale individual would consider as truth.  WELL over 51% of the population is capable of making fatal or ridiculous decisions. 
We are not counting on 51% to control things.  We are counting on not being able to get 51% of peoples to agree on change.  Or whatever x% is "consensus" and at least not on changing the things significance to bitcoins stability parameters. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 02:04:25
edit: I meant to point out, I'm seemingly quite in line with your thoughts!


I think this as well.  I think 1mb was innocuously chosen and talked about by Satoshi this way for this exact reason: 
How do you convince the peoples you cannot have your cake and eat it too? 
You don't.  You can't.  You make the decision for them.
No one has convinced me that there can be consensus for any such change at all in regards to this block size debate.  Maybe thats silly, maybe everyone knows there will be such change.  
But all I see is more and more proposals dividing more and more groups.  If laymen saw this coming, Satoshi clearly did too.  I see this all as a text/attack on the stability of bitcoins core principals. 
People say we will soon be discussing the 21million limit.  But I think rather we should put both debates to rest forever and move on as a society with a new reference point for our economic growth.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:44:09
Yes about the former, it is what peoples often miss.  The first realization is that a trustworthy payment network (ie block chain) exist other wise players could not transfer value in a real world application.
I'm nto sure about lightning channels, but the basic idea as I understand it is you timelock yourself a refund on what you will have access to wagering.  The bets are be uni-lateral or bi directional or whatever.  Drop out tolerance is handled.  All actions can be verbose but are perfectly enforceable with the credible threat of calling the floor (ie posting the block chain).
There seems to be some comparability in the metaphors and if its true then bitcoin's block chain as a high value settlement layer (ie not scaled to visa) could theoretically likely provide the infrastructure for the entirety of igaming.
For the latter yes and no.  Yes we understand each other.  No it is not unsolvable.  I will give you a hint, if I offer you a more profitable game guaranteed but there is cheating and collusion will you still rather play vs a game with no profits? 
This is the clue to how we solve the sybil attack you speak of: a profitability standard.

Trust is related a way of saying a reliance or expectation of stability of value. And so yes in your explanation it makes sense that this trust is broken when the governments devalue and manipulate the fiat supply/value.
In this context gold and bitcoin share this trust.
Nash was asked about bitcoin and gave this response in regard to the honesty of money (and its quality) which he also spoke and wrote about: 


Yes but it is also relevant to point out this utility is possible because of gold's supply which is related to its cost of production as Nash points out in his lecture Ideal Money:




Yes this is relevant to but I think we can inquire further into Satoshi's choice of bitcoin's immortal parameters. 


I think also there are different perspectives from which different explanations are appropriate. Nash talks about why we might not want to return to a GOLD based system:








It's two ways of pointing out the same thing when I am suggesting Gold's supply is predictable and that is where its value as an inflation hedge essentially comes from.


I just wrote about this: 
My suggestion, and we return to the OP title above, is that the aggregate of the subjective view points is the ultimate objective we are searching for.  You might have an argument that its not, but my argument is about “for all intents and purposes”.  That there can never be exposed a MORE objective view than our total subjective and so it must be understood to be the most “correct”.


This is why I think the statement is of the most significant and telling that Satoshi gave.  I think there are not many 'economists' in this world, or other people that would stand in his position and tell the world that Gold is going to gravitate towards its cost of production.  For many this flies in the face of reason.  
What's more is that Satoshi is implying that gold will lose its allure as an inflationary investment and that something might take its place.  This really speaks to the block size debate imo in regard to whether or not bitcoin was meant to function likely a highly transactional and cheap money or more like a settlement system that Gold at one time functioned as.
If Satoshi was a group, I don't think there are more than a very small handful (maybe 3 or 5) that I know of that could have agreed on such a statement/sentiment.  It leads me to believe it was one person that made the statement and I only know of Nash and Szabo that I think would put their credibility behind it. 
It was a bold thing to say, in a very important position imo.  
Thx, I appreciate reading your thoughts.

@_date: 2015-09-16 15:28:41
U r confused because you are assuming I am dumb and don't perfectly understand this.  What I have been saying is there will be no consensus for change in regards to changing the implied nature of bitcoin.  In other words big and giant blocks are not going to win this debate.
Whatever magic number you want I don't care 51, 70, 75, 80 etc. 
A meaningful example is quite simple, lets say you have 4 proposals, and these proposals contrast each other in certain ways.  then you  have 4 groups that each want 1 of these proposals and don't want the others. Each proposal has 25% support and each group is not willing to change their support.
Then they have to ask, if they will then accept no change, 1mb.  If they don't want 1mb, they have to coelese and join support with each other (ie cooperate).    
You gotta get cooperation, and its not at all a guarantee, in fact I'm suggesting its not at all likely. 
I don't have a perfect example, I only know some basics about the American system, but you certain have many example of bills and proposals that need a certain amount of support to be put through or considered.
There are many competing parties in the bitcoin world that do NOT want ultra scalable blocks. The community is divided, you and others are confused because you don't want to see this. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 23:43:04
its an argument for not raising the limit to scale to visa imo.  
@_date: 2016-10-11 05:52:31

You are ignoring the entire infrastructure, bitcoin can never be duplicated.  The way its network and underlying mining economy, exchanges, devs, supporters, bug and attacks etc.  It is the real deal. It is the proof.  People will say "sure you SAY its better than bitcoin, but bitcoin is here now".
This is the one thing bitcoin can do that nothing else can, be first.  Look at how hard people fight to say gold will never die. Bitcoin has the power, you have to take that power in order to beat it. Maybe eithereum.

Bah forgot an important point.  Gold has a sort of natural throttle in regard to its availability vs. the cost of going after it (deeper and deeper as Nash explains).  As technology improves through the stability of its supply could change as the cost of production might go down rapidly.
In regard to bitcoin there is the possibility of cheaper energy sources (***edit: and other associated costs!) and so I think to create a most stable relationship you might link bitcoin's supply to the expected rate of efficiency we would gain in regard to producing energy.
So I wonder if if decreasing supply by half every 4 years is a reasonable approximation for that change.
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:42:19
To the former, yes the IN-elasticity is (paradoxically?) what gives bitcoin its SPECIAL value it seems.  Its predictable supply allows the markets to have SOME confidence in the stability of its its value.  Perhaps like you allude to, more so than gold.  Its not the characteristic we generally look for in money though as individuals (but the markets are a stronger force in valuation).
I believe in lighting, seems obvious.  
Elasticity in existing currencies, perhaps future ones, is going to get real relevant I think.

@_date: 2015-09-27 17:13:00
The solution is to provide a network in which many competing business models can use for the basis of their service.  Kind of like bitcoin providing the channels for wallet providers and other types of services.  But bitcoin does not solve these customer wants, nor should the mental poker implementation.
By creating a network linked to its own resource there can be establish a decentralized market equilibrium between all competing forces.  Many problems such as collusion are solved because bots basically run and own the network and keep it sustainable and trustworthy.  The key is they provide a platform for private games, solutions, and services that pay rake to the underlying public level.
There is still the possibility and likely hood of a randomly seated public casino, but its not as necessary as one would originally think.

I suspect this is the first the problem has been so formalized and presented academically.  I just had the thought that it's a really big deal to suggest that we have reason to believe we might have to change bitcoin's monetary implication in regard to our global financial system.
We don't have anyone talking about this, how things are supposed to evolve in relation to bitcoin...
To suggest we might change it from an ultimately deflationary money to an inflationary one is a really really big deal.
I think you points suggest we can mitigate his problem.  I see a debate on the horizon about whether we WANT to mitigate or just have an inflationary schedule for all time...
If I understand this correct, that debate is incredibly significant, more so than the block size hoax.

The security desired ultimately is what I think is supposed to be left to the markets, to me that is what was the key solution Satoshi presented.  The security needed is the minimum that is enough, and so it is really a theoretical conjecture that we would never agree on as a proof-it must be a real live experiment in order to not argue this.
Reading the 80mb thread I just have the belief or feeling that what would be quite useful for this world is the settlement layer, and a rush of technological expansion in regards to different possible side channels. 
This suggestion the price of bitcoin would go up, as well as fees possibly.  It suggests bitcoin is not for coffee.  
As for the 21 limit, I understand and agree with your sentiments about how the markets or miners would just adjust.  Except there is a key point made by John Nash in Ideal Money, about how what is really needed is a good source of measurement in regards to stability of supply.  
So he means to point out inflation of this type is not at all the problem, and therefore and inflation-less money is not necessarily the solution (nor would miners appreciate the lack of reward!), but rather a money or commodity with the most predictable supply in relation to cost of production would be quite sufficient enough to garner momentum as a global standard. 
I still haven't heard anyone talk about this or address it.  Difficult to tell if I am truly crazy or if Nash's point is in fact quite relevant here.
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:29:16
@_date: 2016-10-03 07:30:31
One more point I meant to touch on.  When talking about citizens moving from fiat to inflation hedges on speculation of a future fiat of inferior quality we can understand that the relationship between good and bad money (or whatever commodities might be used as the hedge) and savings is altered if we can finally come up with the solution for an inflationary free currency that is secure in this form for all time (hence the term "ideal" is it is sort of a theoretical notion).
I think "savings" then is really a phenomenon of having less than ideal forms of money and this is why the subtitle of Nash's Ideal Money is "the motivations of savings and thrift".

A rheomode is an extension of our language through scientific inquiry and logic by a very highly praised quantum physicist. Through many talks with J. Krishnamurti bohm was able to extrapolate an understanding that our language is limited in a way we don't otherwise know and can't express.

I don't know how bitcoiners mess this up.  The first part is release a protocol with a secure implementation (think bitcoin.pdf), the next step is bootstrapping the infrastructure.  
What you want in a client and marketing is far far away from poker's version of bitcoin.pdf.
You don't solve this problem with a client, which is basically a bank.  You solve it by giving the protocol for shuffling/dealing and gameflow in realization to passing value probabilistically .
The rest such as marketing and clients etc is what evolves because of the infrastructure.
If you can't see it from this perspective you have to bow down from the inquiry.

I think you outline this well enough but there is something about the property of gold and why we value it so highly (but not necessarily for its industrial use) that needs to be understood and related to bitcoin


What does it mean for a commodity to max out its aggregate subjective value?
I think that we tend to feel gold has its value because of its exchangeability, rareness, and indestructibility.  These might be important parts in regard to an Ideal Money, but gold is not very readily transported in comparison to other money/commodities.  
Where gold seems to get its value as an inflation hedge is from the stability of the cost of production in relation to the supply which I think could be suggested is a sort of maxing out of its aggregate subjective value.
Satoshi says that the price of any commodity will tend to gravitate towards its cost of production, and so I think here with gold we find a reliable value for gold that becomes a bearing point for market expectations. 
Because of the nature of the energy, costs, and political implications of mining bitcoin (ie most of the world can do it), I think bitcoin might become a stronger bearing point for stability of of this type.
The key points are that we are looking for stability through PREDICTABILITY, and that bitcoin doesn't need to be perfect but simply better than any alternative commodities that might be used for such a basis of value.
So I think there is an argument to be explored that bitcoin's greatest value is not at all found in idealizing it as a currency/money, but rather as a gold in the special way that gold has been valued for, which is not intuitive to us I think.

Well certainly being able to break all the world's gold into 4, or into millions has different effects.
Bitcoin being 21 million is not really a thing, when its really 21 mill x 8 decimal places.  
We can't expect 38 million "coins" to change the properties we get from "scarcity" and we wouldn't expect 7 decimals to do that either.
But i think scarcity is really quite psychological in some senses.  Bitcoin isn't really at all very scarce at 21 mill x 8 decimal places right?
@_date: 2015-11-29 02:23:48
I don't so much think there is the direct connection between Nash and Szabo, Satoshi etc anymore, I guess...but I think it is relevant to think about "bitgold" in which Szabo and Dai basically admitted they subscribe to money that is printed in relation to basket of commodities and some of the relevant points nash makes about gold as a historically ideal standard:
    Clearly, in terms of this geographical perspective, gold has historically been optimal, largely because the labor cost of moving it over great distances is so small relative to the value of what is being transported.  Thus, gold formed a very efficiently movable medium for the transportation of a value exchangeable for other values, ultimately deriving, in one way or another, from human labor (with the achievements of warriors here also being viewed as involving labor).
    (i) The cost of mining gold effectively does depend on the technology. Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.
    (ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be “politically appealing.” so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.
    (iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such that even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:31:42
In regards to John Nash's Ideal Money bitcoin seems to be the perfect "battery" to make his machine work.  His machine is still quite in the future. Bitcoin as a settlement layer NOT a coffee money.  What is more important is that blocksize debate needs to end in order for bitcoin to have the traits that Nash describes.  To say that again, it is the very debate itself, which creates the instability that renders bitcoin unusable for what Nash proposes.
As for mass adoption my understanding is as it gets more popular such change gets harder and harder and hopefully naturally impossible.
My conjecture is Satoshi believe at a certian point it would be impossible, and that this is favourable.

When people talk about the quality or idealness of money they are often referring to the exchangability and the cost of transacting etc.  When Nash talks about these things he is more specifically referring to the equivalent of a money that is inflation targeted for 0% or money that's value doesn't degrade over time.  For this bitcoin could be a more ideal form but it doesn't have the special quality of holding a value that is stable over a long period of time.  I think THIS is what we should each want to explore.

It might be lazy, but its the prevailing perspective from anything that relates to our global financial system, that inflation is necessary and helpful.  For now, these problems seems separate, securing bitcoin vs optimizing our global economy, but I think nonetheless its not irrelevant that Keynesian theory is sort of dominant atm.


I don't have the technical knowledge or language to fully traverse these papers and problems.  My understanding is the paper does cite transaction fee variance as the problem.


Yes but you mentioned once, in regard to the block size debate, that "this awkward phase will pass".  I understand the sentiment but it certainly hasn't passed and I think its only really a subset or beginning of a bigger (inevitable) debate.


Ya :)  But I feel like everyone should care.  Its interesting to consistently see this technology optimized from the perspective of security and the developer but never seemingly from the perspective of an economist and in relation to the existing currency systems. This Princeton paper proposes an inflation schedule that COMPLETELY ignores the global economy perspective.  Who can deny that changing bitcoin from a deflationary currency to an inflationary one doesn't have implications? How does Princeton faculty ignore 20 years of Nash's works explaining the impact of an international currency with little to no inflation on our current system?

It rebukes the argument that the prices, for example of bitcoin, are not "correct".  It seems some student of economics feel the markets aren't efficient and so the efficient market theory and what extends from it isn't valid.

Two points.  First it doesn't say in that sentence that bitcoin is and must be that which you say.  also and more importantly a settlement system does not violate the rules of that sentence.

What you describe here is exactly poker's triffin dilemma.  What we might call the balanced wanted between players goals and site goals.  But what we know and are learning through bitcoin is that capitalism is important for a thriving economy.  If you don't give incentive to the best "players" then the entire economy suffers.  It SEEMS counter intuitive but it is not.
As one of these "bad players" you and others are stuck in the view that poker MUST be this way, but already it makes no sense to suggest one man or group and redesign our financial system to not need to support these inherent issues and pitfalls.
You and others would certainly laugh years ago if I proposed a currency system that is not control, manipulated, or profited on by third parties, central banks, and governments...

People might not "feel" they were pressured into accepting it but it has traditionally been their only choice.  In regard to crypto accepted on a mass scale, we should expect it to happen basically on "price" alone and that no one should be upset about the obvious prosperity created.

Yes you understand.  But what is crucial is that I came to this realization by arranging "ideal money" as the paper "ideal poker".  This paper states exactly this point and shows how we have come to understand this whole problem backwards.
Players and sites alike cannot understand how to apply what satoshi did to the industry and that is because they cannot let go of the inherent nature of the centralized model.
"poker Satoshi" or soaked patoshi as I call him is probably one level above monican.  Monican probably created b-money, there is one last step for integration and implementation and therefore bootstraP:
You are going to create a model that exchanges money for chips, this is a bank, and if it is going to disrupt a multi billion dollar industry then it needs to be more than ultra secure.  
If it is going to attract players then it must also be profitable to some equal or better extent in relation to the status quo.
If it is going to be profitable then bots will game it (and cheaters).
So there is levated a bot network that can be decentralized and to mine for the entire network.  
Public zoom random seated tables (of mostly bots) play at the lowest level of power, and use their hardware and software to secure and validate the private games.
Private games are not "games" but neo-sites that use the poker network as their infrastructure.

Trust has different important meanings.  In regard to semantics I use "transmute" to suggest comparable systems which can be seen as similar problems and solved as such. 
We tend to think of trust as in loving family and believing in them but I think the word predictability will get us further. 
If something is predictable we can trust it. 
If a family member gives random outputs or the wrong output we cannot trust them for this yet we still love them. 
That thing that won't fail is something that we are bound to trust.
What I am suggesting is the truth of the matter will determine what we as a society trust and put our faith in.  This is a different view than most see and understand "trust" and what we put our foundation of it in.

Also the style of your post DOES seem all to familiar. 
If I understand you correctly I would suggest that the truth of the matter is that there exists a bitcoin and that you need to start with that fact at the crux of any acceptable argument.

 &gt;   It is also notable that there has been an overall sense of always increasing human per capita wealth, globally, as technological advances continue to modify the nature of the global economy. But consider the effect of measuring wealth purely in terms of square miles owned per capita of the earth’s land surface. If each Hopi tribesman owns x by this measure and each Navaho tribesman owns y by the measure then, with global population steadily increasing, should they feel happy or sad?
    Perhaps humanity will REALLY arrive at increased wealth if we can successfully colonize lands beyond Terra, like the surfaces of Mars,the Moon, and some asteroids. (But of course we could not illogically claim ALREADY to own the whole Solar System at least, so it is clear that psychological alternatives enter here also with regard to the issue of the “true” evaluation of per capita wealth.)
    Possibly the full psychological effect of human “ownership” of the surface of Mars would not be realized until that area had been divided into plots regarded as the private property of specific corporate or personal owners!

ty very few people have expressed appreciation, although I can admit they are usually certain/special peoples and it's been getting a lot more attention which is expected.
I think you are asking if this is Nash's first mention of "bitcoin" which is funny because he straight out changes the subject (albeit to "what is good/bad money") after calling it "the bitcoin", and yes I believe it is the first mention.  He's been reading from this lecture mostly but its 20 years old :)
I think they are a little leery letting him free talk, and he is probably fine with that because he obv gets strange looks and disinterested peoples (also I have learned we have a cognitive bias about money)...
He definitely trolls though, I saw him say his favorite movie was the one with the ship...and then he waits for them to take the mic and he yelled "It was TITANIC" or something as they took it away...
Its actually all very coherent in its entirety. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 00:00:10
I like a lot of your points.  We know its valuable cause its scarce, but many of your other points don't suggest a reason its so highly prized.

The non-sequitur happens when you suggest that many things being invented with an unknown inventor suggests bitcoin is not growing a religion. Bitcoin is growing a religion, and its not dependent on whether things were invented with unknown inventors in the past.
Its simple and rational to point out, and the more dismissive you are of the subject the more I feel it is true.  Many peoples have mythical beliefs about bitcoin and its nature and often say things like "check the white-paper", but its for things that aren't in the paper such as "Satoshi said bitcoin should be an everyday coffee money".

If you take a different view of bitcoin's utility "congestion" is not the result you see, but a satisfactory excess of demand.  Many favorable market situations arise like this in which simply the cost of use goes up.  This causes bitcoin's "economics" to behave like gold. Hence the division between "digital gold" and a payment system that the tweet alludes to.
No I can explain, but it was VERY well explained by Dr. Nash in the lecture series Ideal Money, I have done my best to explain it in many subsequent articles that DO exist, but I'm not sure you likely intent to read them.

I think then we have opened a more truthful inquire into the nature of bitcoin and gold as a social phenomena. And it truly does break down into things like particle duality and plank length doesn't it?  I mean we can be spiritual and esoteric about it or laugh at the thought.  But truly in some contexts the scarceness is psychological.
From there I think one might enquire into whether its because society is stupid, or whether there are other favourable factors that make bitcoin useful like gold (if it even is).

If you watch you will see not much will change ever.


Yes.  But think of it like a balloon that once blown up will be different than its un-inflated state-regardless of what people initially perceive it to be and expected it to become.


You haven't qualified this and I think you are about to admit this:


But that isn't qualification is it?  And I'm not sure its true there was NEVER any REAL TALK about this since the inception of bitcoin (or before its creation).


I just think we need to consider what we are saying.


It's a balloon that was pre-designed to change its state upon a certain initial growth.  Core isn't going to consider targeting the transaction capacity for a certain perceived rate of growth.  That mandate isn't part of the design of bitcoin.

This part you made up ;)  The FED that controls the monetary policies of the USD targets the currency for x% (2?) inflation in comparison to various prices and costs.
There is an alleged attempt at stability of value.

no idea how you found anything there to "lack knowledge".  
Ignorance might be suggesting I think szabo has authority because he has a twitter account.  Szabo has been writing about and around this subject for 20 years.  By "authority" I which to distinguish between an appointed authority figure and a person who is the most or of the most knoweledgeable on the subject.  The latter should be consulted and it would be ignorant to suggest otherwise.


Again this silly use of the world authoritative.  Its not that I am pointing to someone that has been simply given power, but rather we mean the definition of authoritative: able to be trusted as being accurate or true; reliable.
Think about how silly what you are saying is, that you are mocking people for wanting to listen to the most educated and knowledgeable on the subject.  Do you realize the simple truth is, you do not understand szabo and others argument because you are ignorant on the subject, and by ignorant it means you are seemingly clearly lacking relevant knowledge?

This is rhetoric. Central planning has a special/specific meaning that was conveyed by Hayek and is supported by Szabo. You aren't attending to that meaning/explanation.
Capitalism, does NOT mean that YOU get to run around to every entrepreneur and tell them that your group is taking over their idea to take away their initial decisions.

Ya. I think raising the limit in order to support some arbitrary amount of transactions is Keynesian/inflationary and unscientifically founded. Bitcoin doesn't need more transactions in order to be cheaper than gold or more efficient to transfer. 
That it might be only for people that are willing to be high fees, is not the concern of anyone serious about bitcoin having a stable/strong valuation over time.
More transaction capacity cannot be shown to increase the value of a bitcoin, that's just silliness and not admitting the obvious trade-offs.

I didn't understand your points, perhaps I am not familiar enough with her bio, but I believe I understand the sentiments.  Rand WAS certainly hypocritical in some senses.  But to me she had discovered some root logic that we were previously unware of socially. I mean that "socially" because there were great peoples before her that exposed it but she brought it out through literature which is somewhat more useful for the masses.
But she was caught saying things like 'A woman could NEVER be a good president'.  
The writing of mine, although admittedly not fully coherent, does point out this subject in regards to Lord Actons letter.  He means to point out that we should hold our past leaders to the present day standards.  I think the correspondences response though makes a good point against Actons stance, and I think I extend it some.
In short, you can't blame Rand being imperfect in her logic.  She was right and moral in some sense, and wrong and immoral in others. Its just simply that (and a product of her time/environment), as all peoples probably can be perceived (and objectively viewed!)

At the end of the wars (WWI and WWII) as the end of global conflict was on the horizon meetings were called to discuss how the retribution and restoration (ie settlement among nations) would be carried out.
Around that time (1940-1942) John Maynard Keynes, an economic philosopher from Britain, often quoted for creating the theoretical basis for our currency economic system of central banking, conceived of a proposal for an international settlement unit/currency called a "bancor".
The idea was accepted and implemented as what is now called the IMF, an international bank for loans and settlements, however the actual workings did not distribute the power some nations might use to exert pressure over weaker counterparts.
Instead the IMF turned the USD into a reserve currency which gave the use control over the monetary standard of that time. Eventually the system collapsed and we were left with the floating currency system of today.
By using George Selgin's free banking thought experiment, It is shown that bitcoin will rise to be a commodity money (ie a neo gold standard) which will evolve to function in the exact role of the bancor as described by Keynes.
Keynes name is often used in vain by proponents of a gold standard and/or free banking. This is at best a mischaracterization.
Keynes ultimately believed that settlement and our monetary standard should be out of the hands of corruptible agents.

They want bitcoin to be a coffee money but they don't understand the there is no macro economic theory in which that is a useful endeavor to pursue.

Which means you are writings piece designed to have us compromise with ignorance and malicious intentions, while disguising your argument as sincere and wise.

@_date: 2017-07-26 04:52:19
the basket of commodities approximation is a great measure for stability of value but it only can possibly solve the problem theoretically and therefore not the whole problem.  
The problem is the mechanism for adjustment is not freeable from political corruption.  
Nash defines the basket of commodities deeply and terms it an ICPI.  But it is not the mechanism for his solution.
He reasons that if our international currencies were forced to compete on an international stage and had an ever increasing value then they would limit to what would be a theoretical ICPI.
From there the problem is solvable but backwards.  Ask the question what would force the respective fiats on to such a stage of competition?
In regard to joules the work done must be towards economic efficiency I would think.  I can't be destructive in this sense.
Much of your economic argument is Keynesian and is shown to create the bubbles and booms and busts and not to prevent them.

Quote it, so that you can show me in the whitepaper where satoshi makes this distinction.

I clearly said in the monetary sense, as in value.  What can gold do that makes it so valuable and gold not.  It is a very easy thing to say.  Asking if chickens can be trees is different.  Do you understand why?  Do you need an example of like things?


Again I completely understand what you are pointing out here, seemingly twice as good as you. Bitcoin doesn't fail stress tests in the way it needs to be to be valued like gold.
@_date: 2015-10-05 05:47:51
Ya see only some people are understanding me, but your question here does.  Its a little more than that.  I would prefer to answer: he purposefully limited it.
And few people will listen to me say that beyond there retort: but he said he wanted it removed in the future.  
Of course he didn't say that, he said it could be, and he described how.  And then 3 posters right after pleaded for him not to leave it in place.
But I think because of the nature and process of bootstrapping bitcoin it needed to be in place.  In most regards 1mb, 2mb, 8mb is arbitrary.  And so there must have been some foresight to this difficult debate.  Truly I think if he had a plan otherwise he would have announced it.
From what I see I see an ignorant masses that wants there cake and eat it too but cannot.  So they choose to try to make bitcoin a visa.  Which Szabo points out the futility of.  And I see it too.  But more importantly I think I might see a greater use for bitcoin as its most stable implementation possible and that means to never change these core features that make it what it is.
It seems to me that the less knowing players want bitcoin as a coffee money the world can use.  But I think we are slowly calming down and realizing it doesn't work like that.  Change comes from the top down, governments world banks, massive corporations etc. Definitely through emerging economics and technology but the point is we really need to think about what it is that makes us co-operate as society and to think that it is simple cash/money that does this is ignoring Adam Smith, Szabo, Nash, and yes I believe ignoring Satoshi too.
But I see why we do it, as a mass.

I think we have inherited a political debate and I think it was Szabo that referred to the debate (or an alt proposal) essentially as an attack on bitcoin.

Yes it can.  If bitcoin is to grow to what Selgin refers to as a commodity money, then creating different use cases alters its value proposition.  So if the markets are creating a valuation today for bitcoin as a commodity money by Selgins definition, then haphazardly changing bitcoin will absolutely destroy its value: 
My question to you was are you prepared to argue about the macro-economic implications of bitcoin in regard to the proposal.  I am asking if you are prepared to explain, not whether your are idealizing bitocin as a currency, but if you are idealizing bitcoins relationship to the EXISTING financial system.
That is what I want to know, because I am getting the impression none of you are considering this.

the words p2p ecash, is not at all an explicit remark about the division between bitcoin as a coffee money or a settlment system. 
In fact your quote "peer to peer e-cash" is not at all hardly a sentence.  And in fact you did not at all give a quote that is from the paper.
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:50:24
I think it should not be seen as un natural at all. In fact I would suggest it MUST be nature. Furthermore we should be able to explore such thought while remaining scientific in the inquiry. This means we should be able to go back through the history of man in relation to wars and violence and discover the root causes that may or may not have to do with gold or to the quality of money at these times. 
The general realization I think we will have is that there is a great correlation between the quality of money and the peacefulness of living and relating with other cultures.  But in a way that is just defining those times as having "good money".  I think Szabo's Shelling Out essay ( and much of Smith, Nash ( Hayek's etc. works like to convey that money and the systems it brings about is the culmination of clashing societies, ideals, communities, parties etc.  It allows us to CO-operate.
But "we" were not always human, contrary to popular subconscious thought and action. And so through smith's inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations we can learn what it is that allowed us to grow and conquer and innovate and learn so much over the last few thousand years.  Szabo furthers this understanding by bridging Smith's works with our understanding of the evolution of software (  And by this I think we can extrapolate information about the past evolution of life that eventually became man.
Smith/Szabo have us understand such evolution and social/economical progress in a 2-d plane ( which is useful because it is simple.  For a few thousand (or more or less) years digging or swimming down, or building or rising up, hasn't been the main factors in such progress.  If we think of evolution in the ocean though, the usefulness of 2-d plain thinking wanes.  Let me project something we can decided how we like.  If evolution happens in a certain determinable direction we should expect certain conditions to cause a type of stability in which perhaps an ocean form finally evolves to a land form, and thus the dimensional plane changes.  
So we can think of this all in terms of equilibrium that are eventually achieved (for reasons not yet described), that are eventually either broken down to be achieved again, or that out grow the current paradigm like when man first started exploring space (thus changing the scope of the problem). So it is interesting to think or see that all things fall to the ground, yet there is still clearly some type of evolution going on that is see-able and we might want to look at exactly what that is and what is its cause.
I am not sure that bitcoin is completely free of the ability to be taken violently.  But I do think bitcoin is a strong money, and I think it will inspire money that is far stronger than most of us could perceive.  I think it will force governments and money issuers to issue money of a superior quality than today otherwise the peoples will not accept it. 
I think that is the science, and that all other beliefs and explanations for this world, our society, our daily lives, is religion.

I have a friend that shares your side and less than mine (german btw).  Most people these days also share your view that we need massive change fast.  
But there are reasons why an unchanging bitcoin would be far more valuable than 50$ a coin.  All you are really saying is for the purpose and vision YOU have, bitcoin would be worthless.  Its not at all to say its not worth more than 4 bill for other reasons.
You are purely thinking of it as a highly transactable money. But there can be other uses.  


This is not at all a proper risk assessment and does not at all equate to the risk being small.  The risk of a project with this much potential failing FAR outweighs the reward. This project can NEVER fail, or else the peoples won't have faith in bitcoin 2.0 for 100's of years to come.
It's stability in regards to security bitcoin needs in order for the markets to put their faith into bitcoin.  The ability of the community to vote and change the nature of it flies completely against the face of that security.
There are parts of bitcoin that need to evolve and parts that don't.  But saying "bitcoin needs to scale to visa" therefore we must hard fork soon and support a system that scales to visa...is simply starting with a premise.
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:33:19
thats what is more exciting to YOU.  But I think you'll find if you really really study the subject bitcoin as a digital gold is FAR more exciting and far more helpful to our society.
"Congestion" of the network is just your view.  Other people call it "how things should settled".   
In other words bitcoin as a digital gold is costly to use, and that is beneficial to our society for reasons you are unaware of.
@_date: 2015-09-27 01:59:02
Understood.  This is why I called it not changing the "implied" nature.  Where as Satoshi implied with speech we would keep the nature the same by raising the limit...but in reality it seems that the implied nature of 1mb blocks (which we might be stuck with in some form or another), implies that bitcoin would start out as a payment network (low cost) but without change would eventually turn into a high value (high cost) settlement network (aka digital gold).
There is still room to raise the size, but there is still the need to make the decision of digital gold or not.

There is nothing in there from me advocating 20mb blocksize. I've always believed it shouldn't and won't change.

Hold on.  Ideal money, nash says COULD be arranged by linkage to an IDEAL commodity of baskets....
But of course that would be politically corruptible right?  Did we read the essays?  :)
But nonetheless that would be ideal.  So there is some theoretical metric that we can levate if we can find a way to produce ideal money.
No his money isn't corruptible, he doesn't propose  something, he explains what IS corruptible and what isn't.
I think that it means there is going to be a war, a catalyst to the natural evolution of better and better money and i think me and nash think that ultimately it will lead to a money that has a perfect relation to an ideal commodity of baskets (whatever that turns out to be, neither me nor nash feels anyone should pick it i think).

Right and so it doesn't necessarily stand to reason that increasing the tx capacity increasing the value and therefore price.  In fact, on the other hand, if scaling comes at the cost of security and is forced through political pressure and an attempt to take control of the direction of the project it could be said such change would NEGATIVELY affect the value of the network.
So here we can understand such actions would EFFECTIVELY be like inflation but without ever manipulating the supply.

I'm not one of the one's spreading fud.  But something changes when we collectively become aware of this direction to take bitcoin.  So the community is effectively perturbed.  I believe there are fatal directions to take bitcoin, I do not believe the markets/network would accept such changes though.


That's quite close or perfectly in line to what I would think to be optimal.


Awareness comes before code is all.  I would think if somewhere between 5 or 10 sincere and reasonably informed persons entered dialogue on the subject of the implication of immortalizing bitcoin's status quo then the underlying structures and mechanisms would natural change as a result.  Core would change.  The roadmap would change and the direction of some of the coding would change I would suspect. 
But not as the result of a hijack, coupe, or usurp.  Just a movement based on dialogue protocols.


It's my point too, but once a significant portion of the community understands the significance of considering bitcoin's macro scale implications then there will never be pressure to push agendas that are reckless in this regard...
Rather, today we are seeing this:


Core is bending to the whims of a faction of ignorant users spending time giving them compromise and trying to figure out how to do so without compromising the security. 
The disparity between this latter example and a "core" that starts proposals with "We considered the macroeconomic implications" is such that the former to me is near ridiculous and the latter could very swiftly bring us into a new age (as a metaphor).

@_date: 2017-07-11 22:52:39
I don't read reddit enough to have come across your posts on this but i would read a few blogs/articles if you linked any.  I have thoughts on why some different perspectives would be useful but I think the direction of your idea has merit. 
There just needs to be more of a flowing process.  Like you could agree on a certain aspects and agree that a tendency towards solidifying status quo is best, knowing that there are possibly some more minor enhancements that are acceptable and don't drastically alter the value proposition.
More importantly, I suspect its harder than you realize to not create a cult, and to not let the power of it absorb you.  For this reason its probably why bitcoin had no ethos.  It could always be misinterpreted and probably it can be shown it can always be exactly interpreted in perfectly polar opposite ways. 
I think also a large movement isn't necessary as a goal or in other words not much boot strapping is needed.  A few people that understand that ending political strife is optimal and that change is insignificant would change the whole community quickly because only a very small amount of people are needed in order to veto the whole war.
You don't need to have the biggest army if you are a status quo supporter, you just need enough political strife that none of the other sides can change the network.  A veto can be done with a minority which means an even smaller minority can have a reasonable vision of success.

It's the top thread (was).  But its not true, or in better words thats not what the evidence shows.  It may be true but its a significant stretch of the truth.
In this thread I am not inquiring about the btc-e guy.  I wanna know if Ver's agenda would be inline with someone who stole the gox coins.  I want to know if you would need to send 10's or 100's of millions of transactions to obfuscate the orgins etc. or something to that end.

@_date: 2017-07-25 13:30:47


You have a far better understanding than most but I think we can be clearer.  Suggesting inflation is warranted is symptom of what Nash would describe as (and I would be inclined to as well) a keynesian.  I don't not agree with the conclusion. In fact George Selgin gives a strong argument that slight deflation would be the symptom of Ideal Money.
We could talk about why and I could reference the book of his if this is interesting. 
I think you mean to say that Bitcoin does not count as Nash's Ideal Money because it is to be heavily deflationary. 
I don't intend to make bitcoin Ideal Money nor do I hope that any community does.  It's not possible because you would break it's gold like quality by opening the political debate further. 
I also suspect we can break "joules" down further and show the ambiguity of the concept.  It's all ambiguous thats why money is helpful and why we want it to be stable and ever more precise. 
We can make bitcoin gold like, but not ideal.  THAT is where the fighting starts, not understanding that.

@_date: 2017-07-27 00:13:57
Ya I can help you but we have to make sure the paradigm is right because its a leap.  I've read a vast amount of Szabo's works, and they are only obscurely related meaning you'd have to read a lot of dense material to get the meaning through all of it. 
He is incredibly thorough and had amazing foresight.
Yes a future, but we are approaching it fast.  The infrastructure costs don't exist and can be implemented not as a nation but as a small business idea. Someone that fits cars with digital engine locks.  Sure they can be bypassed but that costs the consumer something they usually aren't willing to pay (risk of getting caught etc.).  The efficiency ultimately pays for the costs.  So I think we re-solve this by agreeing it will take time and evolution.  But these changes happen all time. 
For an amenities breach you could have a 3rd party in the contract/escrow you might even add a social media site like reddit that pays its members to judge in a trustworthy fashion. Of course their are many other examples and each can either be solved digitally or it can't and must be decided the old fashion way. 
What's most important is that the code is immutable so you if you find out how to get something like nuclear codes stored and fired securely you could take such actions out of the hands of fallible humans.  Or if we can think of very high value contracts that require incredible amounts of security there is great savings from the efficiency since no army is expected to attack something they cannot breach.  
And ya blockchain lawyers.  Szabo talks about it, the future of being a lawyer and how and why they are needed.  Basically to transcribe.  But szabo never implies the legacy systems will be completely usurped.  They are valuable he explains because they are tried tested and true (and evolved.

Check those links out, my arguments are founded and cited.
@_date: 2015-10-03 16:50:18
Its a very significant point but let me be a little more scientific about it.  In order to change from gold to bitcoin you have to change society.  And society is complex. Society changes slowly because it is complex like untying a very complicated knot.
On the other hand I think there is room for rapid change for many reasons.  Historically we have effectively broken monetary standards over night and have other massive changed based on technological break through.  
I think tradition is the least scientific, yet I think your point hold to very true. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:11:32
Its different to know about the future vs to know that we are witnessing a tangible invention created by one man or a small groups of persons.  And of course bitcoin IS real and we know someone created it.  I just think it is far more inspiring to know that persons were human, rather than fictional. I dont' know if what I am saying makes sense.  A lot of people suggest it ruins the mystique to not know.  IMO though there is a lot to be gained from discussing the real story, the REAL story.

@_date: 2015-10-03 16:47:49
I'll give you all this but only to the degree of theory or conjecture.  I don't think these things you think can be changed can.  I think there is and underlying proposal by Satoshi that says "I'll boot strap bitcoin, and you people see if you can change it."  So I understand what you mean by social construct but I think its a perspective of yours, in actuality I think the parts of bitcoin that make it valuable like gold cannot be changed.  In other words getting everyone to agree is going to be impossible.  Thx!
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:01:26
It can all be fine and relevant to point out, but I think you aren't really considering whether or not these things fix bitcoin's ability to arise to become an effective settlement system between nations, central banks, and meta players.
You are still thinking I suspect from the perspective of a "user", and furthermore I also suspect you have no basis in economic philosophy for coming from this approach. 
You have SAID we must consider the smaller, but you haven't shown it affects the larger. 
You suggest exchanges would be more decentralized and therefore charge less but you haven't shown that there is a significant gain, and you haven't shown that what is evolving today which is a competitive landscape for exchanges that there isn't already sufficient decentralization. 
Nonetheless I hope you appreciate the dialogue being opened because you are voicing concerns and suggestions that I think don't typically belong in the "scaling conflict".  
So I think you have not perfectly understood and engaged in the dialogue I mean to open, but in a sense you have because it open and we participated and related to each other.

Ideal Money, with a capital I, refers to the stabilization of the currency's value in relation to an objectively perfect unit of measurement (theoretically).

I forget exactly but it was different back then.  At first my posts I believe were shadow banned and/or I also had a throttle on how often I could post based on my reddit points (I don't really  know how reddit works). 
Roger claimed ignorance and said he'd have it removed.  Again can't remember but I think he pseudo had it removed the first time.  Actually I think he claimed it was a site wide policy or something...
Even once removed my comments were being immediately hidden via the voting mechanisms. 
So you have an obvious game where the mods keep the forum full of supporters of their agenda, and this including the ability to sybil attack (ie creating many many supporting accounts) and then you can just auto downvote dissenting opinions and call r/bitcoin a censored forum because it guards itself from such sybils attacks (again a false flag) while claiming you don't censor at all, knowing VERy well that dissenting opinions get hidden from first view. 
They like to "the hidden posts are the ones I go to first cause they are the best"  which makes no fucking sense.  
So I (allegedly) sybil attacked their forum until they proved my point, some moderation is necessary otherwise chaos.  Yet they claim they don't ban people. I'm proof they do and they are forced to admit it and forced to admit moderation is necessary.

I know it your position, and its terribly subjective. It flies in the face of basic economic philosophy and the ethos of bitcoin.  There is no authority to decide.  There is no "we" that doesn't cut out "they".  You have no authority and you will not find logic or reasoning that creates such authority.

No.  My argument is that Szabo is a pseudonym, and we could not be more blind to obvious truth.  Isn't it true sir (or madame), you have not read any of Szabo's writing?
Because I have been through most of it many times, I have also read Nash's works many times, probably more than anyone. It is very clear, the truth was split into pieces, and these pieces render us unable to understand what is simple...
"Ideal Money" is the "contents page", a chapter page (do you understand these words, I do not know what to call them), and Szabo's works are the body of the book.
Please do not tell me they do not make sense, when you simply can look up these papers on your own, and verify it for yourself.

There is no such scenario where bitcoin is valued so much that the traffic congestion causes the price to implode.  As the network gets "congested" the price rises in relation and allows higher and higher value players to use the network.  This is what is observable.  It is what the evidence and facts show to be true.  Your fud view is fud and not a reality.

It was coherent enough.  There is problem with the ICPI which Nash readily explains-it wouldn't be free from political corruption.  It needs to be chosen and maintained.
He only uses it to explain that it is the benchmark which money would asymptotically approach if it were to be set on a trend towards better value stabilization:




I'm not sure you have thought about the timeline of inflation that erases debt as it cannot be wanted to happen so fast that it does so in one's lifetime.  Consider rather the effects of technology on one's "debt".  
Much of your argument is ceteris paribus and so my intent provided we are able to arrive/start on the same page, would be to add the possibility of different "levels" and that although ceteris paribus the solutions are what you propose but that technology is effectively a new level with a new dimension for games to exist, we are able to solve the problems that would otherwise appear incredibly unorthodox.
It's true it makes sense for money to be printed in relation to the population, in practice this might not work well as a "policy".  Nash makes no policies and proposes none.  Rather his solution does not come with proposal instead it is seen as an inevitable result, from their you can extrapolate a solution for how to get there, knowing policy is always corruptible:

To me its really like  saying that nobody will use bitcoin.  Or suggesting our Grandparents won't use iphones or facebook, or email or the internet.  Today's poker model seeks to attract degenerate peoples to fuel the game.  But I see a world in the future in which we all have more money, or more stored value.  Many types of non poker players might come to a game that is arranged far different than today, a game that is meant to attract peoples that want to play with professionals because it is entertaining. I admit today's ipoker has evolved to be far from entertaining in that aspect, but the solution I think must come from the players perspective and not from a 3rd party sites rake policy.
So you see my suggestion is that 3rd party sites cannot provide the solution to pokers triffin dilemma, any more than governments can rationally contemplate sound money.
@_date: 2015-11-28 22:07:21
Thank you.  In regard to scaricity there is a point to be made, and Szabo made it well I think in "mining the vast deep" and Nash makes it well in Ideal Money.  Gold is not so scarce, but is to some extent in relation to the availability via cost of mining and its political location etc.  There are advantages and disadvantages to them.
To further make this point, is bitcoin scarce at 21 million coins and would be not so scarce if Satoshi chose 35 million? And of course we could ask the same question in regards to different levels of divisibility.
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:29:58
let's talk about what is...
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:26:19
Some argue the exchange prices are somewhat fabricated for these.  And its true, unless the exchanges and trading an liquidity are very established the price isn't really a proper reflect of value.  
For example, if i create 1 billion poker travis coins and sell you one for a dollar, is the market cap really 1 billion dollars?
Furthermore these altcoins offer things, some of them of value, bitcoin cash does not have a real utility, it offers nothing unique.
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:50:32
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:37:25
It's propagating recently that you cannot measure decentralization in a meaningful way.  I can quote szabo on this.  Sufficient decentralization is sufficient.  And you cannot use this as a means to argue for a change.  What we have works, and there is no argument to the contrary because of that empirical truth.
From another view you are asking what the optimal blocksize is and /or why 1mb is best.  We cannot optimize bitcoin through optimizing the block size.  The whole movement is a red herring and is not founded in economic philosophy.  
The block size could be many different arbitrary limits and any would suffice (1.4, 2, 7, 7.5, etc.), rather opening it up to perpetual political debate degrades the stability of bitcoin's value proposition which is EXACTLY (and only) what is being done.  
Targeting the blocksize is a false dilemma the very act of the central planning folly, to argue that it can be optimized.  It is fine where it is and there is no argument to change it.

Easy to spot certain types of thinkers.  My point was similar and corollary to yours.  It think its nearly impossible to quantify in the direction of the op.  However I think it might be possible, and maybe even simple to show the possibility of a N.E. in regards to not having enough agreeance for consensus for significant change to nature of bitcoin in regards to block size.
If a certain group of peoples do not agree to such change, and then the rest of the peoples must possibilty collectively agree or a large portion.
And then we can add pay-offs by looking at the different interested parties, their want for each type of bitcoin in regards to each block size implementation. I think it's quite possible it can be shown no such change could likely occur and that it will become more apparent as time goes by.

If we think about ideal money in relation to energy and Hayek’s incredible machine (which is effectively the worlds most efficient evaluation machine), what humans really are creating or aiming for when it comes to more and more favorable forms of money is a manufactured type of energy.
To further examine this we must refere to TWON and understand the relationship between the effeciencies caused by the division of labour, in relation to which he, Nash, Szabo, Hayek and others have pointed out in regards to money as a store of those efficiencies.
It can’t be argued that energy is created in this fashion, but thinking about effectiveness and reference points there is some perspective from which this would at least SEEM possible. So in this I wish to highlight the effective relationship between energy and efficiency gained which if for example here is only a finite amount of energy, can be an effective solution for the want or need of more of it (sadly not yet a solution to entropy problems).

You might get banned from being able to engage with this community if you create an implementation and a name or no?  I do not know about this specifics but I'd say do what you are willing.  I would suggest that not creating any meaningful division before a dialogue opens up would be best whatever that means.
I suspect there would be immediate and great interest for it, unfortunately there is purposefully a lot of noise.  Many many participants are aware the argument is floating around.  
I remember now I could make a thread on bitcoinforumtalk.  Just looking for reasonably reputable members.
Its a different event to have, its not a big scaling debate or propaghandi forum with an agenda, but the opening of a talk of whether or not we are going the wrong way.  So its really that the participants are reasonably reputable and sincere that matters.  There is no need for a fancy venue etc.  
A mailing list/forum etc. reddit is obviously tough unless the community decide to levate the topic daily.

Well the real compatable vision can also be thought or said to breakdown to essentially "whatever happens is correct" or in other words the markets are rational.
But I think there is some implied technological advance to bitcoin's value proposition and I also think that the sincere developers would really rather have no public mobs telling them what is best.  
So to me its a sort of community movement rather than a developer movement which ultimately would allow proper economic arguments to get through the noise as the dust settles from the unnecessary duality being perpetuated.
I'm far more comfortable with "We propose X change after considering the global/macro economic implications" rather than "this will effectively give big blockers what they are insanely clawing for without damaging the security."

You took bitcoin from a science to stupidity, grats


Yes you admit you are ignorant on the works


You didn't give reasoning and there is no reasoning you gave you opinion on what you think will happen which is in complete contrast to observable history and economics.


People ARE using  it and it is increasing in value, that is why high value individuals are starting to be able to settle higher and higher values in it.  This is how economics works.  Its a science, and its not like predicting weather.

How is an indefinite amount of ignorance worth so much energy? 
You alluded to the idea that you and other active devs are familiar with Ideal Money.  But it cannot be true.  It's a clear end to the civil through a reasoned argument that you clearly don't have access to in your arsenal otherwise you would evoke it. 
I've scanned as many of the elite personalities I could find...no one does...

Thank you for participating.  I want to clarify, I am very pro bank.  Banks aren't evil, they are not people.  But they are broken in a sense that they can be improved which is something you allude to :)
If bitcoin's value proposition can be maintained and the political pressure wanes I think bitcoin would arise to pressure banks to function in a coherent order together.  This is why our view is so unpopular, most people think banks are evil, but most people also don't understand what banks are for or how they work.

Science doesn't do this.  It doesn't say X is new therefore past observations are not applicable.  There is a great amount of literature extending our historical observations with our ongoing understanding of crypto-economics, much of it written by Nick Szabo.  
It is those that aren't familiar with such writing that are "guessing". 
There is no founded argument for your implication that bitcoin cannot gain value if it is not scaled for more users.  It's a guess you are making and  its not founded and not correct. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:31:59
Ok so for example then, we need to weigh the possibility of a "major economic change" such as what you describe with possibility that such a change might (negatively) affect bitcoin's value proposition.  To do this we have to explore whether or not having this change or LN is crucial to bitcoin rising as high value settlement system. 
If it isn't crucial there is no founded reason for implementing it.  
Saying the change would decentralize the exchanges more and bring exchange cost down doesn't address such inquiry.  
If I have missed your argument again then you will have to point it out to me, but keep in mind we probably don't use the perfectly same definitions and not from the same perspective. People seems to find my arguments strange but eventually logical and coherent in my experience.

@_date: 2015-10-04 22:04:59
I tend to agree with a lot you say, but we don't come from the same perspective and (therefore) don't foresee the same purpose/implementation of bitcoin.  And technically I'm not sure I understand everything, but it can be far overshadowed if we think we are coming from the same want of direction.
The direction of your proposal here seems to be quite uncharted which makes for a lot of speculation and also a lot of study.  In many ways it is intersting.
But with respect for stability, it seems if we took things the other way, there is not so much to study, and we kind of already know the answers.
So I am asking about the possibility that we could lock the block size debate in a NE in which there could be no consensus for (significant!) change in this context.
TLDR; There might be a quicker more concrete solution here, but it is not favorable to the direction of a highly adaptable bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:51:15

thats the wrong direction.  Money's most valueable use is to measure value not to transfer it.

@_date: 2017-07-24 05:41:02
But you and others think about it like "how can we optimize bitcoin" but the greater question is "can bitcoin be used as a catalyst to optimize our global economy".  In short, if we are always in a political flux about scaling issues, then bitcoin's value proposition isn't as stable as it could be. Honest money is stable in value as a result of the transparency and predictability, opening a scaling debate negatively affects this parameter, it becomes effectively dishonest.  The goal should primarily be political stability ie neutrality.

Well so far the whole world is completely mystified about who this "Satoshi" is-which is simply a name at the top of a paper and a few emails.  Yet on the other hand, there is a man that has been touring the world clearly explaining how a new money technology is going to evolve and completely and radically change our entire financial system.
Did you happen to watch the slide show below, and do you still claim what I present is so vague and illusory? I feel I cannot be more blunt, about a man who also seems to have been perfectly clear and blunt.  I do not mean to say this person is Satoshi.  But there is a simply fact here, one man clearly stands out as having every single mo of the entire bitcoin project...and there is not another person in this world that fits that.  
Except N.Szabo, whom everyone feels created bitcoin, but most people admit he is a pseudonym.  What people are largely unaware of, is that Szabo's works is like the encyclopedia extension of J. Nash's lecture Ideal Money.  They perfectly complement each other. In short, I cannot fathom what is vague about any of this, and it cannot bother me a single bit that there are many people that have not read either Szabo or Nash's works, that want to call me crazy.

The problem with your argument and my point is that you cannot call one subs policies censorship and suggest the other is free from such actions.  SOME moderation is necessary and each sub does the moderating it feels is necessary.  Ver saying theymos is the censoring is blatant hypocrisy and I and others are proof.
The only reason he can continually state such lies is because his crew silences the dissenting opinions of people that would ACTUALLY have an impact on bringing awareness to the truth.

Are you prepared to argue that that would serve a significant economic purpose in this world?  Because I'm prepared to argue that it doesn't and the pursuit of it (in this manner) would destroy the significant (macro-economically related) properties of bitcoin.
Are you considering bitcoin's macroeconomic implications?  Or, like Ver, are you running on the premise and assumption that coffee money solves a significant problem our society faces?  Because I don't believe it does whatsoever.

trying to target the block size is a pipe dream, if you build bitcoin on a pipe dream the markets will reject it as a digital gold.  There is no optimal.  It is "fine" the way it is, and there is no reason to quantify its effectiveness. The block size doesn't matter in regard to bitcoin as a gold.

yes but some development is necessary even if the goal is to change it as possible.  It's two different directions one, trying to idealize it as a currency, and the 2nd try to create something that changes less and less.

Ya exactly, and so you don't know that they are all being idiots.  You don't know what I am talking about.  Why don't you take a gander at that article.  It explains the true macroeconomic implications of bitcoin if we don't haphazardly scale like every r/btc person wants.
You and others are functioning on the belief that bitcoin as a coffee money is a valuable solution.  It's not.  There is no economic theory that support that assertion.  Its a tacitly held assumption.
The argument that is supported by Nash Szabo Selgin Smith and Hayek, is bitcoin as a settlement layer. And r/btc's goals destroys that possibility. 
And you are arguing for a compromise with such destruction, simply too, because you don't understand what you are asking for or looking at.

I'd be quite happy to be at all known simply for starting this dialogue, assuming its not really happening anywhere really.  That you bring up these points I think starts a dialogue in a fresh direction and would inspire a different kind of relationship (to relate) from different players.
It forces core to concede some points, yet gives them more control to do whats "right".  
I think I was told transaction malleability doesn't need segwit, but that's all stuff that the devs should be discussing, I wouldn't argue them and it would be silly to.  
I think an economist would/should be far more consider with the biggest picture possible, and would expect the smaller aspects to fall inline naturally once the macro direction is determined.  An economist wants to address the global problem as described here: 
Competition is great and usually ideal, but not at the expense of missing the mark on a bigger more important problem.

I've been saying this to have no response with those leaders that spend wasted energy refuting his redic claims. My best theory that fits, the only one, is he and karples have the gox coins and he made a deal with Chinese miners to exchange them at a discount for newly minted coins. The irrational  part is what is demand to him by the miners which is why it doesnt fit the rest of his alignment. He needs a change to clear his name from the coins before he can have the wealth. It would suggest everyone thinks he is a millionaire but he sees himself as a trillion air or more and effective owner of bitcoin and eventually the world

Its not an extraordinary claim. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 03:02:02
Perhaps I am mistaken.  But my understanding is common knowledge suggests Satoshi implemented the 1mb block size as an anti spam measure.  Now as I understand, me and you both know its not in the bitcoin.pdf, and furthermore I think I understand it wasn't ACTUALLY satoshi that did this.
But I am always partially trolling I guess while making a point.  My point has generally been that Satoshi knew this debate would happen.  He knew it would be an impasse.  And so I have come to believe that he saw it as an attack and hoped by now bitcoin would be secure enough to guard itself from proposals such as "gavcoin" (i don't call these things gavcoin etc)
1 picture shows Satoshi explaining we can change things in the future...the next shows someone IMMEDIATELY pointing out that its not a good idea because it will cause a difficult debate:

yes but you are basically suggesting (without further context) the "doubling" will happen on the day of halving etc (however it changes)...but of course if the price is going to go up, then "market theory" suggests the markets will already have accounted for it since its a very predictable event.
So you say "It HAS to go up", and I am saying yup it already has starting to.

Yup so now we know how this finally all goes down.  Something hidden is happening where ver and a bunch of nefarious whales have to do something to be rich but they don't realize its an &gt; sign not a &gt;= sign.  Their math is off and they are ignoring the truth of it.  They are all likely to lose their fortune right before bitcoin changes the world over night.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:38:27
I can't, they banned me.  
I would usually immediately suspect you are deflecting but from this new perspective its easy to see you and other do not realize the truth of these two claims:  Wright has a real key; Ver and Karples are in kahoots. 
If you knew, if it was true, you wouldn't spend your time defending the community from Ver's Brigade and the ignorance they propagate. 
Unsubstantiated isn't the correct word.  Gavin confirmed he saw the truth. And wright won't stop claiming he is satoshi even though he's clearly not (capable).  And other's believe him.  Wright is claiming to have a key.  There is nothing unsubstantiated about what I am saying, its perfectly inline with reality. It is the most direct simple truth. The other alternative possibilities don't actually make sense (is Gavin really so stupid that he doesn't know what cryptography is?). 
In regard to Ver, if you don't know all this, then you should run the sims in your head about (i'm sure you have but re-check this).  
Tell me, sir, watch this video and tell me that Ver is not hiding behind his chesire smile 1 million coins, billions of dollars that he believes will trillions or more: 
You can see it in his face, and then all of a sudden his entire game, character, persona make sense.  Everything hes doing makes obvious sense.  He's acting like he owns the network, while desperately trying to create a movement where the fees are low enough to send many many transactions.  And he loses his mind everytime the mempool fills. 
He's smart enough to know his arguments aren't coherent, yet he continues...
It's not me....it's you, either you deflect me because you won't confirm truth, or you spent too long arguing in a red-herring direction and you can't turn around and see obvious truth. 
There is nothing unsubstantiated.  These are the only plausible scenarios that make all of the history coherent. Reality supports the conclusion.  
Ver has thousands and thousands of shards of (stolen) bitcoin and is losing his mind to the power struggle and the want to eliminate the "mempool congestion" and associated fees that are need to free them.

I am not strong technically. Isn't this evidence that bitcoin, needing consensus to change these fundamental aspects, could possibly be locked into a N.E. in which there can be no change?
I wanted to be clear of my poor wording.  If there are so many parties that want to pull bitcoin their own way, then there can be no reasonable consensus for change. 
I am asking about the possibility to show that there is such a solution that no significant change can be made in relation to all these proposals?

Read every article written here: 
Many are about the evolution of law.
The conjecture put forth by Satoshi is that bitcoin cannot be usurped and the top computer scientists agree with that math. Satoshi said something like "If you don't get it or don't agree I don't have time to teach you" and it basically applies to this concept.  If you don't get the reasoning then its best to take it as a premise.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:11:48


I agree with that especially this:


Nonetheless what "we" as in everyone that ultimately might come to understand such an argument or movement (or the lack thereof if the act of defining and naming a movement is rejected) is created then there is implied division whereas I would suggest the goal would be a movement towards a coherent order (at least as much as possible). 
In other words you don't want to incite knee jerk reaction by adding to the division, at least to the extent you don't have to.  


Yes so there is a caution to participating in the conflict created by generalizing the "bitcoin x" approach and creating any kind of social division.


Yes the above I think perfectly explains the role of the users, that stand from the perspective me and you are speaking from.  To softy be able to remind, through dialogue, the active developers that change is means not necessarily a goal.  And the goal can very well be no change. 


It would be a natural evolution I am indifferent to.  I mean ideally core would move towards working on it.  I am basically incorrectly personifying core anyways.


I think thats fine.  But I think there is more dialogue to be opened, which needs a significant following, or a slightly larger amount of participants.  5 or 10, shouldn't be too many either (obviously open ie public like this).
There might be a need for legitimate process to discuss what should be deemed unchangeable and when. And so for this, its quite a public, social, and democratic discussion.  Then the developers, perhaps core, can make concessions on that which is a FAR different situation than today.  It moves the community from hostility and pressure to one of cheques and balances with healthy conflict. 
Pressure to NOT scale unless it can be shown to be safe and necessary which includes the macro-economic implications (and yes this might imply no change ever, but I am simply suggesting the dialogue needs to be opened and the idea of no change given a chance).
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:22:26
the current tps is enough there is no qualification, it equates to a fee a cost and the cost to move bitcoin is already FAR less than the equivalent in gold
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:16:18
idealness refers to its unchangeability and so begin first and having the longest track record it can't be beat.  Remember you cannot design idealness, the best you can do is solidify a currency's parameters from outside control, that will be good.  Ideal money is far more complex and must arise organically in relation to bitcoin.  As each of our respective fiats are forced to adjust they will fall into perfect comparison of value. It will signify world peace.
@_date: 2016-07-10 07:22:57
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:19:14
To be clear I don't care, but that it is never changed in order to scale bitcoin to be adopted by a wider audience or especially to target its value.
Once bitcoin is left how it is, and the community sees the purpose of this, then these things will never be changed.  Then the big players of the world will begin to see bitcoin like we have historically used gold.
And when this happens then John Nash's works, 20 years of lectures and writing on the subject of Ideal Money, will become relevant.
Nash built his proposal on top of bitcoin as a gold.  His proposal necessitates a new type of gold standard, he paints the entire future beyond it, he just never states how the standard might arise in the first place (other than illusions about an internationally e money with a stably issued supply might arise). 
But the result is amazing, and far more favorable than rendering bitcoin as a coffee money.

Rather, Satoshi is an invented concept to conceal truth.  What is factual on the other side of the planet (if there is such a thing), is a very special man, with every capability and every resource Satoshi would need, who has been extensively explaining what will happen in the near future with respect to our currency system.  
But he was lecturing about this 20 years ago, up until right before bitcoin was released.  If tired perhaps the youtube link I shared will help.

Its really silly to suggest that anyone is an idiot who doesn't have their private keys, and this is the sentiment that Andreas is responsible for. 
Its all about what they are risking and how safely they can personally store what they have.  The real lesson should be not to have all your bitcoins in the same place, that is what would be silly, and people that are screaming that you should own your own keys seem to NEVER point that you.

You've already admitted you understand that the core devs of the project explain that increasing the block size haphazardly destroys the security of the network.  You hand waved this fact away with this sentence:


It's completely non-sequitur to suggest that since in your view the mining is already centralized that centralizing it further won't be a worse problem. 
There is no one who can explain your own stupidity to you.  You have seen and understood the logic and decided otherwise anyways.


Thats another stupid thing to say.  You have all the active devs and all the top experts explaining one side and a very small group of people obviously twisting truths and disagreeing with the experts on the other side.  And you don't care what is written by who?  
Dude, you are a moron.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:11:37


This is a terrible premise. Also you have unknowingly subscribed to a tact assumption that increasing the amount of transactions or low-cost transactions necessarily increases the value of the network. 
This ignores, among other factors, that the additional users and transactions are of the LOW VALUE type.  Furthermore, and more importantly, high value settlement and long term store of wealth are bitcoin's greatest use case in regard to "value".  And the argument that you are holding tacitly with others completely ignores this trade-off:

You have shown that decentralization cannot be used as a basis for changing the block size cap.
Furthermore, in regard to these 3 points on sound money:






There is something you ignore which is far too convenient for the big blockers group, and that is that if you are changing bitcoin's block size cap in order to "adjust" the soundness of bitcoin, then you are necessarily adjusting the quality of the currency...
And because of this then it cannot be assured that the future quality of bitcoin is secure.  And this is why we should want to NEVER change bitcoin for this purpose and we should lock the possibility of it in another equilibrium. 
 
Lastly, to do such a thing, to attempt to change bitcoin's parameters to optimize its soundness, is to centrally-plan the currency, which is the exact thing Hayek cautioned us about.

Gotta get bitcoin out of flux.  People that think bitcoin should be debated and scaled as a result don't understand that its damaging to its value as an inflation hedge.
On that note, people that don't want bitcoin to take over gold/usd role would certain be on the scale at all costs propaghanda train ;)

You have (somehow) accidentally highlight yourself, in this regard.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:41:34
You're reading the original paper by the person that created the concept in 1997.  He went to George Washinton Law school.  
The question you are asking barely applies.  If a car needs blockchain consent to run and the blockchain is a ledger, then when you enter a lease if the smart contract detects that you haven't paid it will cut the engine on the car. 
There is a still a need for this transformation but it cuts out much of your industry.  
So you/we ask what contracts can be automated by connecting them to real world security mechanisms. 
Slockit is a business idea that connects smart contracts to bed and breakfast businesses.  So you can enter a contract by sending cryptocurrency to an address and the contract can be set to unlock different parts of a rental suite.  
You try to change the business solution in such a way that you can tie it to an escrow/smart contract system.  
If you want to release an escrow up someone's death you can't really perfectly tie it to a death certificate  or a newspaper clipping etc.  I think this is what you are asking.  The former ideas are quite foolproof the later would need a reliable input that the smart contract can "read" but can't be forged etc. You'd have to change the paradigm.

What im saying is that we need to recognize when transactions are crafted with no other purpose other than to increase transactional costs for political gain.
You have contradicted yourself here.
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:10:10
See, I can tell you are sincere and not a part of the brigade that is spreading disinformation.  And because you write such a succinct point, I am now able to show you exactly what these people and their agenda have done to you.
You see, you paint a picture in which bitcoin fees have risen, and so there is an implication there that SOMEONE is valuing bitcoin transactions for whatever reason (but not necessarily as a coffee money etc.).  Perhaps as a store of wealth, perhaps for some higher very valuable purpose we don't know about yet (that makes it worth the high fees etc.).
And then you talk about the possibility of losing users, which is rational and very likely and possible.  Such users will go to currencies with lower fees (and possibly faster transaction times ;))
But you cannot simultaneously suggest that bitcoin's fees are increasing dramatically, but that bitcoin is dying because users are leaving. DUCY?
What you are left with perhaps is a sadness for all the people that wanted bitcoin to be a coffee money but got priced out by high fees (such people could still get rich by holding their coins in my model). 
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:45:26
Yes but it won't be sound if you change the limit.  So if Satoshi left it at 2mb or 4mb I would be arguing still not to change it. CHANGE is what makes it unsound.

It's a good point except it's all too expected to be meaningful/valueable from that crew.  Often you hear twisted logic, twisted words, which is always quite obviously so.  You hear that changing the block size is not change, and not changing it IS change.  That satoshi explicitly wanted bitcoin scaled and to read the whitepaper, but there is nothing of the sort in it. 
That a fee market is artificial even though it will naturally arise. 
That designing a new block size algorithm isn't central planning, but leaving it as is, is core's central planning folly (not Satoshi's).
That bitcoin will die as it becomes popular, and that the 7billion market cap is a reminder that bitcoin is doomed.
It goes on and on that every point that is made has an illogical twist to it.
That evoking Hayek, or Szabo, or Nash, is an argument from authority, but Satoshi wanted big blocks.

No, you mustn't have understood me.  What I am saying is that you cannot have data on bitcoin in regard to scaling it to target transaction capacity because bitcoin is the leading present day experiment.  Such data is something we might have in the future, but we will never have it for this debate.  If we had TWO bitcoin's with different cap size restrictions, then you might have something to compare.

You have argued there is some faction of users dissatisfied but the price says otherwise and when the system gets "congested" as r/btc brigaders call it then there are many people willing to pay highers fees to use it. 
How can you say the market is both unsatisfied while simultaneously the price climbs as a result of people being willing to pay higher fees?
If YOU aren't happy how does that imply other people aren't especially when the market price shows they are?


Now this isn't how science works. Bitcoin is a certain way and in order to change it YOU need to put the proof up and convince the markets to change.  I don't need to show anything because the status quo is the status quo.


No such currency can offer the same level of immutability and unchangeability as bitcoin.  You are making the assumption that the market value higher transaction capacity and that bitcoin's cap is based on this perception.  But it makes no sense knowing it has the least capacity in this regard but has the highest cap.
Reality doesn't support your implications and nor does logic or empirical evidence.

Some people are putting their "faith" in science and reason though.  Not starting from a conclusion, but using inquiry and dialogue.  So there are two clear and distinct factions.  Those pushing an agenda, and those that are looking for rational discussion and honest sincere debate.  
I don't so much argue we don't all have an agenda, but sincerity is something that anyone of us can have and show.  r/btc is not seen to be sincere by any of the rational scientific players.  It is clearly controlled and manipulated.
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:41:59


Your logic doesn't hold and economics doesn't support your sentiments here.  It might be that SOME won't return but because we both agree of the strengths of bitcoin some users certainly will and also new users will adopt....
Most importantly for example, if bitcoins fees came down, the markets would leave "shittier" coins for bitcoin again, by the nature of markets.
If not, the price will come down until people use it.  
It can't be a rational statement to suggest that people will leave and never come back when bitcoin becomes a good investment.  Either bitcoin is better and people will use it, or it is worse and they will not.  We must be allowed to view bitcoin like any other currency or commodity that works exactly in that fashion...
And to that point, this shows there is not an economic/scientifically accepted basis for change in the regard that you imply...
so you have an opinion and sentiments, perhaps I might suggest could ultimately become true...but core's mandate is not to bend to anything but scientific arguments, and your isn't one grounded in data.  You can't have data for your argument, and this is why the big block agenda will always fail.

bitcoin isn't Ideal Money.  Nash spoke for 20 years on how an e-currency with a stably issued supply is going to take the power from central banks to arbitrarily inflate our money supplies.

No its not my assertion.  My lord.  Read the writing.

You are starting with the conclusion that bitcoin must be massively scaled and then arguing that such a conclusion is proof of itself.  There is nothing to state bitcoin must be kept as high capacity/transaction currency.  There is no "evidience" for this and no rational for it.  And unfortunately to get Core to bend to such an agenda there needs to be scientific argument.
Bitcoin will die if you don't raise the capacity limits, is not an argument grounded in logic or reason.  It's fud.

I think I remember about a story in the Quran (which I haven’t read and am only vaguely familiar with) in which a holy rock fell off its pedestal and started great conflict between the different tribes who each wished to be the one, or not to not be the one, to pick up the rock to put it back to its rightful place.
If I understand the general sentiments well enough, I think the story basically goes that Mohammad came along and put the rock onto a blanket, and this allowed each of the tribes to share the role of returning to the rock to its holy place.
This (re-)maintained peace among the tribes (although of course from a global or “western” view, this didn’t really at all attend to peace in the world).
Whether there is even truth to this story or I have presented it accurately might not be so important, as it seems to serve as a nice metaphor to what this world really needs in order to end conflict and bring about peaceful relations.
We see around the world even today different events corresponding to geopolitical turmoil and we should expect this to continue to happen unless/until each nation agrees to the same mechanism of order.
What we need, and this is explicitly written about in Nash’s Ideal money, is an incorruptible politically neutral standard, to which all nations can agree upon:


Ideal Money is a concept Nash came up with in the 60’s when he allegedly became delusion and tried to flee the US to exchange his USD’s with the Swiss Franc that he felt was of higher quality. Nash was frantically stating that the communist and anti-communist governments were colluding against the people and that he was going to be our new savior.
However, we can see that even up until his passing, he actually felt that this accusation of colluding governments was effectively a rational point to make:


Nash continues with what was historically seen as irrational sentiments from his delusional period:




What I am suggesting “happened” to Nash was, when he was essentially still a kid, or a very young adult at best, he realized he had the mathematical capability to bring our global financial system into order. I am quite certain this conclusion hit him in a flash of insight. Rocking his core beliefs and sending him nearly 100 years into the future in regard to supra-rationality (truth that society is not ready to see or accept).
It is also said that Nash became obsessed with the conflict in the middle east in his “delusional” period, which is completely understandable from this view I have explained here, because he had an immediate rational realization that the levation of Ideal Money is the only way to end the geo-politically rooted instability in this world.

I don't think you have followed well what I have said.  It is the very debate, the very threat of change, that causes uncertainty in regard to the future quality of bitcoin.
Uncertainty implies that people cannot flee to bitcoin as a safe haven, and so this destroy's its property as a digital gold. 


I don't understand what you mean here, but I think you mean to refer to the usd as a currency people circulate, whereas, and especially traditionallly, the usd has acted as a de facto reserve currency for the world, this means people value it much like gold.  For this it is VERY important, and bitcoin would be VERY important if it took over the usd's role in this regard, even if people couldn't circulate it cheaply.


This isn't always necessarily true, and we might suggest there could be a balance needed between a decentralized subset sample of our total population AND the equity with which their uses represent.  Everybody using bitcoin but having it only be a small fraction of the worlds wealth wouldn't be very favorable in this regard right? What we should want is the optimal balance, and this cannot be contrived or designed or calculated.


This is where the logic is circular, from the btc brigade.  You cannot simultaneously suggest that fees would rise and price out users but then also ask who will mine to get these fees.  If fees are high then bitcoin is not broken, it means it is valued by the markets, full stop.
@_date: 2016-07-16 16:29:50

@_date: 2016-07-14 22:07:16
Then you don't believe that more users results in a higher valuation?  Because this is what the majority of big blockers espouse.  That having a higher transaction capacity means bitcoin can have a higher value.


Yes so I see you are sincere here and I agree to some extent.  And to get this cap you need bitcoin to be rendered like gold.  It needs to have qualities that the markets can feel very certain about.  Most players agree that changing the cap size changes the IMPLIED nature of bitcoin.  That is to say that with the current size bitcoin is destined to be a very expensive to transact commodity, not a very good currency to circulate.  This means that the players that will use it are ones that are willing to pay massive fees.  I am suggesting central banks and nations etc. 
But if we start to mess with the parameters to target bitcoin for whatever reason, big players cannot feel certain about the future of it.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:45:40
Greed would suggest that keeping 1mb would be favored since it would render bitcoin like gold rather than a money.  There is also the inability for any group of peoples to seriously consider john nash's 20 years of lectures on how an e-currency with a stably issued supply is going to take the power from central banks to arbitrarily print money.  The big blocker agenda completely ignores this material, and there is no group of people seriously discussing these lectures and essay's. 
The thesis is essentially that to render bitcoin like gold, is to ultimately bring our global financial system into order as a solution to the triffin dilemma.

Its very similar to Roger Ver's logic where he says "bitcoin is like starbucks, therefore ____"  As IF you can just make a comparison and then start extrapolating "truths" because of it.
When you post about this here, or especially r/btc (which I am banned/censored from) you get the "impression" that this is something he might just be ignorant about or whatever...
But in all reality its incredibly sad and messed up, to see people that otherwise would seem to CLEARLY know better, about what logic and science are, and how they work, completing twisting and conflating facts to support a conclusion that has no scientifically grounded basis (simply a premise and assumption that are attempts to support themselves).
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:40:24
You say what I meant to say, far more eloquently.  I don't agree with the last sentence though, unless we are referring to a sort of relativism, in that there can only one "best" and a few of the "top experts".  But, and I think that I am bordering on super and supra rationality when I say statements like this...I think we can still approach effective security/stability in this regard by having a larger group of players that are decently knowledgeable in this regard.
In other words we might agree we cannot optimize this aspect, but there is a tipping point that IS achievable, that is conjecturally sufficient.

Well to be factual, Dr. Nash has been doing lectures for 20 years on the advent of a technology that is going to to revolutionize our "money printing banking system" that is "like gold" but not gold.
No one knows who Satoshi is, or who comprises the name.  But we seem to have an affinity for S whilst completely ignoring the significance and validity of the lecture "ideal money".

I can attend to this question.  1 mb, 2mb, 5mb, 5.5mb...etc are all equally fine.  I think that it is important though, to leave the block-size cap as is, and so for this, 1mb does just fine.   It's not a magic number, doesn't need to be, but the attempt to scale to achieve some arbitrary goal in which we have no data for and never can have data for is arbitrary, keynesian, and the type of central-planning hayek warned us against. 
If we started to scale the block-size for such a purpose, then there could be no confidence from the markets that the future quality of the currency is assured, and thus bitcoin could not be sought as an inflation hedge by investors wishing to leave fiat (or other less stable commodities).
So for that reason, 1mb is perfect, and will always remain so.

No.  This is the premise of the system, that you can create it such that the community cannot make changes that destroy the integrity.  Much like the infrastructure of the constitution.  The idea is you have freedom to change these things but you need overwhelming consensus.  Democracy isn't such that the majority can over-ride the minority, no matter what the ignorant masses think it is.  The purpose is so that the ignorant cannot overthrow the wise. The problem with out economic systems is that every time there is a crisis we begin to tear at the integrity of our standards.  What we have needed is a standard such that we cannot corrupt it with our own collective ignorance.  Satoshi said we could change the 1mb limit with consensus.  What he didn't explicitly say was that consensus is contractually impossible to reach. And it doesn't get easier over time, it gets harder because the entropy is such that more players learn the truth of this as time goes by.

That is the difficulty of the problem.  We have always functioned without a proper metric in this regard.  But we can't properly valuate ANYTHING in this world, without that metric.  
And this is why the Keynesian system is very bad, because they are inflation targeting with our money systems, but they have no ACTUAL stable metric to target.
The ONLY way to "find" ideal money in this regard, is for the currencies to compete on the markets, we NEED the markets to solve the problem, by competition, and so bitcoin is needed to be introduced so that the markets and the money print, begin the process of valuation.

Yes, I have said for the longest time that ydtm writes and researches nearly faster than me and I can write essays while playing 30+ tables of poker.

Gmax mentioned to me that such propaghandic times would pass and I did agree, and it seems they have jumped the shark in that regard and we are watching the rediculousness wane.
I really wonder if Wright convinced a group of players he was satoshi and they felt it was their duty to reclaim bitcoin.  And to be clear there were not minions upvoting near as much as manipulation of the voting system.
There was no debate, just the attempt to make it appear as though there was a debate, but its interesting to see which bitcoin media sites were involved in the disinformation.

I'm suggesting it might be incredibly difficult to organize a consensus mechanism or any such extension that would be favorable for some form of democratization of this process.  But the suggestion comes from the corollary that it might be quite easy to show that opinions already differ far too much to allow for even the possibility of change in a significant context.
Its like saying, "hey wait, before we spend years trying to figure out the best possible consensus for change...maybe we should take a moment to see if change is even possible in this fashion"
Its quite simple, but i could understand how those that function by "change" as an assumption could not understand what I am saying.

The special consideration of a key is to not lock it in that which it unlocks.  I think you failed the power test here (S.Lerner did I think too).  This key is the most powerful weapon we have available with the ability to harness society.  Benevolent Satoshi would have locked it within that which it unlocks, and let it be a transparent "safe".  
We should look for it there, and hope. 
Otherwise, what you describe is a process that would have a destabilizing effect TODAY, because the markets would not like this uncertainty.  
I also think a benevolent Satoshi would not accept this plan because its not fair for people that do not plan on being ready for this type of event.

You've kinda countered yourself here.  I mean who's gonna want a bitcoin controlled by the government vs one that can't be controlled by anyone?
ALL currencies historically are controlled, and EVERY government has incentive to continually devalue them.  
If you notice the debate that is "plaguing" bitcoin, there are people that want to completely change bitcoin and remove the block-size cap.  These people are oblivious to the fact that this will destroy the perceived stability.
We call these people "keynesians" as it was Keynesian economics that we used coming out of the 2 world wars that our societies subscribed to which is the belief that you can print money out of financial crisis. 
Bitcoin is the ONLY currency that no matter how much pressure is put on it, it will not bend to ANY type of attack or political pressure. 
A new government currency CAN'T have this quality, because of course the governments themselves can and WOULD change the characteristics over time.
You ask intelligent questions, but make sure you spend some time researching and studying actually literature on the subject.  
nick szabo's blog goes over everything.  John nash's ideal money is very relevant too.
Good information is hard to find.  There is a lot of bad posters and trolls here this is why I often start off with baseless comments until I found out you are human...

@_date: 2016-07-14 21:27:58
If we start, rather, to suggest that we must manipulate the cap in order to make bitcoin sound, then we have perfectly stated the Keynesian agenda, which is the belief that you can inflation target sound money.  But you can't, because the goal is counter-productive to itself (in other words it is the very act of inflation targeting that causes the markets to leave different fiats because of the uncertainty in the future quality of them).  
Bitcoin is the most sound when no targeting exists, and it exists in its own rights, to the markets valuation of it.

@_date: 2016-07-14 17:01:37
So we come to the same conclusion, but of course you do not have a scientific/economic basis that supports your argument (otherwise I might expect to have read the paper).  
Yet I do claim Nash has laid this grounds in his lecture series and writing on Ideal Money.  I have to think you haven't read it or you would invoke it.
Ignoring conspiracy theories such as a small group of bitcoin elite are protecting Nash's input...
It must be that we believe that he could not have foreseen this debate, and the implications of a technological implementation of a money with a stably issued supply...
But we can only believe this if we do not traverse his works.
This is a serious matter for the world.  You argue for a significant conclusion but overlook the rational basis that is already laid forth for it...
And in my opinion, the world awaits for a strong player like you, to join the effort to bring about a world of Ideal Money, by the definition that Nash gives us.
Today I seem to be the single proponent of this proposal...
What will happen when TWO, not just one, knowledgeable sincere players joins the effort?

Please clarify.  What is the slope and how is it heading anywhere?  My argument is 'not to change', to 'move nothing'. 


Your conclusion/"therefore" does not follow from the premise, you don't have any data to suggest that filling the blocks up is a bad thing.  Without data, you don't have a scientific argument, only opinion.  Not liking the reality of this is not enough of a proposal for change and so core will reject your sentiments, because they are only sentiments.


Yes and we will continue to scale, but scaling under the belief that we must target something that cannot be targeted is keynesian, central-planning of the kind Hayek warned us against, and will destroy the markets confidence in bitcoin as an inflation hedge.

I don't think they ARE playing by the rules and if they were I think reddit would probably consider changing them.

No.  To the contrary, I think the banking industry, the governments, nations, agencies, etc, all want their share really bad.  And this is why bitcoin is to be the most valuable thing in this world.
You don't understand economics at all, so basically I am not interested in discussion but I'll give you a clue here.
Every asset, every commodity, ever currency, can be over-supply, can be devalued.  And if you notice they the global economy works, you will see that each government TRIES to devalue their currency for export and tax purposes.   
Bitcoin doesn't change in this regard, this is why KNOWLEDGEABLE players are so excited about it.  Even gold isn't actually so rare that it's supply doesn't fluctuate unpredictably.
You talked about value.  You need to know that they only things that have value are what the collective of society DEEM to have value. 
You cannot provided me undervalued stocks, because that is only YOUR opinion they are undervalued.  I won't accept that opinion.  No one will.  The opinion of "value" I accept is the markets' opinion.  And the markets are flocking to bitcoin which means it is valueable.
That is how economics works and why bitcoin HAS value.  And we should expect it to increase as governments devalue their respective fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:03:14
No idiot.  The price is gaining and the transaction fees on average are rising because MORE AND MORE economic value is being transferred through the system. What kind of asinine comment is it to suggest the system isn't valuable because YOU DON'T find value in it when its OBVIOUS that there is an entire industry that values it more and more as time goes by?!
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:45:32
Take a look at the title again and think about what I just trapped you doing.  Like flies to honey.  You're a branded troll now with evidence and admission for everyone to see. Keep it up :)
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:23:52
You should email satoshi and tell him. In the meantime you need scientific data and consensus for such change. Which doesn't seem like it will happen.

bitcoin can't be made to be ideal. to try to make bitcoin ideal money is to centrally plan it and therefore to destroy any quality as a store of value it might have.

Bigger blocks in order to scale bitcoin's transaction capacity is not on the table.  It never was.
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:55:03
I address this by saying "stability of bitcoin's value proposition".   Often you will see me say this, sometimes not if i am lazy careless or think it not to be specifically relevant to mention.  
And for this and furthermore value is not price.  And underlying value proposition that doesn't change could still have a changing price especially if the commodity/asset is new and there is discovery happening.  
So we want to guard that proposition and make it so that bitcoin is very predictable.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:48:13
Everyone here knows thats not true and I'm quite willing to compare notes and knowledge with you to prove it publically.

You are a troll too, an empty account. A moron wasting your life.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:31:58
There is no such thing as a crypto economics, and before you tell me what bitcoin's relation to the economy is I need you to claim you know what you are talking about.  Have you read a single page of a single book on economics and if so, which page of which book please?
You are an empty account.

@_date: 2016-07-13 18:09:22
I like how you put it here MUCH better.  I don't like the implications otherwise. I'll agree. Especially with your last sentence.  We get a brigade of trolls in the bitcoin community that want to suggest that everyone needs their own private keys and this is not the case, its Andreas fud.
@_date: 2016-07-04 02:17:07
Now that I see someone who understand the reason and rational behind this....
There is something that will eventually come to light, that cannot get through all this big-blocker fud...and is very related to this:


Its true.  And its scientific to say.  And all reasonable and sincere players realize this.  It leaves all the insincere players that continue to try to push an agenda with no scientific ground.  In fact its far more truthful to point out that there can never be scientific ground to change the block-size in order to reach a goal that has never been experimented on.
And so we begin to show that when media represents both sides of the debate, they are not actually being balanced, but rather they are giving a voice to an unreasonable argument.
And truly, and I have shown this explicitly in articles of my own, to change bitcoins block size to meet an arbitrary and unfounded goal is central-planning by the definition that Hayke warns us against. 
This suggest and especially in tandem with Nash's works on ideal money, that such actions WOULD in fact destroy the value and integrity of bitcoin as a store of wealth.
What is more important though, there is an explicate argument laid out for this that is under the title "ideal money".  That a very brilliant man that once already re-defined our understand of economics and money, has spent 20 years on the subject of EXACTLY what it is in regard to gold that has historically given it its value.  Also exactly what it is that makes a currency get adopted by a peoples, or rejected by the same peoples.  The argument of exactly how and what an e-currency with a stably issued supply will eventually take the power from central banks to print money...
How come you ignore this?  How come coindesk ignores this?
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:54:43
Are you going to address Ideal Money or only my character?
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:36:18
You are wrong, and need to inform yourself on what Ideal Money actually is.  It's not bitcoin.

It's a good enough summary.  I thought this was a succinct intro though:

You have misrepresented Gmax's sentiments as his following words point to a trade off between utility and soundness which is the ENTIRE point we are getting at.
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:22:38
This is what I'm talking about, a perfect example.  John Nash is basically the most intelligent man (other than Jiddu Krishnamurti) that graced this earth, and he spent 20 years lecturing and writing on the subject of Ideal Money.  Why does your ignorant ass ignore this?
@_date: 2016-07-12 07:00:34
He was. Sometimes it blows me away how far ahead he could see and I have to lie down and collect myself. Ideal Money is a concept he says he came up with in the 50's-60's when he fled to Europe because he wanted to convert his usd to the swiss franc.

Bitcoin described as a politically neutral money is a reference to fiat. It means its not birthed by a nation.  It's not a false reference to make. War on state is stupid, we created state.

Ah ic.  This was also referred to on the twitter account.

Does centralization and central-planning seem like the same words to you?  They are different if you really look at the letters.


Without opposing views?  How in the world did you trick yourself into thinking that there are not opposing views?
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:01:16
Its really easy.  The big-block agenda is suggesting that upping the limit will create more user adoption and therefore raise the price of bitcoin and the network.  This alone is justification, because changing the value of bitcoin through manipulation of the cap is in fact an admission of decoupling bitcoin from its soundness.
Soundness is a money what's value is stable over time.  Fluctuation in the value breaks this characteristic.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:54:24
I don't understand what this question is referring to, you will have to be more specific.

Ya you would be but at the same time just by asking you are probably ahead.  Szabo will impress you. He has had insights on tech cryptography economics finance law etc. for many years because he has clearly known the direction we will go.  He delved far into our history and prehistory to observe how the evolution and formation of contracts took place in relation to law. 
The advance of bitcoin ends a very long debate on how money can arise and changes the way we will understand how our civilization evolved in the past (40,000+ ago etc.).  He goes into great detail about this and breaks it down to binary math. re-explaining the empirical evidence (ie punishments paid via money and goods).

Why are you commenting on something you have never read and don't know anything about?
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:31:51
Big blockers admit they are attempting to raise the block size so that bitcoin can grow in value with the network.  Such an admission is an admission that changing the block size effects the soundness.  Sound money doesn't change in its valuation over time.
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:34:17
You make my point perfectly, community is filled with people that have no understanding of economics which is what bitcoin was founded on.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:02:42

This roger guy is a moron.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:26:18
I understand what you say. But remember the 1mb limit exists and the argument that we must raise it to raise the value of bitcoin is an admission of the corruption of any soundness it might have.  
Furthermore, the suggestion that bitcoin is not yet sound but might be if the cap is not changed, keeps Gmax's sentiments consistent. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:23:43
But you don't know anything about economics and you are just spreading fud though.

@_date: 2017-06-26 06:00:21
I read it as they have a business, perhaps that is not what they meant, but I am suggesting that their own opinion might not qualify as educated on the subject simply because they are a "disgruntled user".  It might rather be that they are using bitcoin for something other than it is supposed to be used for, which is why they are not satisfied with it. (I did misread the part about NOT having a phd).
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:31:15

No.  His judgement was clouded, and so the vendetta arose.  The cloudness came from power, which corrupts, which comes from being fortunate enough to be an early adopter. In his eyes, it was intelligence that gave him this fortune, but the wise know better. Even Satoshi was fortunate in this sense.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:56:13
Yes but you cut out the convenient part didn't you? It's a temporary overflow that eventually causes bitcoin's price to rise in response. 
Honestly, honestly, think of how you seem to me when you do that...

@_date: 2017-06-26 01:24:09
You don't know anything about economics though right?  Like you have never read anything on the subject.  The fees are rising because so many people are willing to pay them.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:42:50
I don't have it, perhaps someone will post it.  But I saw it myself, and have experienced it.  And it is not argued that such manipulation goes on.
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:15:55
:) I know, I know.
Both the interviewer and the translator are clearly fans.  They are clearly interested in the subject and their level of knowledge and questions mixed with the slight language barrier creates a very good presentation for the Japanese population that is new to bitcoin but will no doubt have a ton of value to bring to the project. 
Obviously it would be better in some ways if it was perfect Japanese spoken by both parties but I think that's not quite necessary.  It's probably very helpful to just mix the culture slightly in regard to the "setting" for the interview. 
It's more palatable for the viewer if they can learn about something new without a total culture shock.  
Both this interview and one with Ver had a VERY different feel.  
As she gets experience more time I think can be spent on sorting out different words and matching them in real time with Japanese words.

You are conflating circulating a hot potato with an increase in value.  Gresham's law explains people hold onto what is valueable and pass on what is not or declining.  
What point are you making in this regard?
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:10:00
U have understood me well enough. There is no such burden on me. In prefer to change the protocol a proposal that the markets deem ratiotional must be put forth. I don't call for change. Ur want for proof of 1mb as an optimal choice is unnecessary. What is needed is a firm decision on the future proposition which can be almost any arbitrarily chosen size. I'd be fine with 100 or 2 but that still leaves no reason for change.

Gresham's law explains people hoard good money and spend bad money.  The "good" "bad" is not defined by your ignorance.  It is a reference to the stability of the value proposition, of which bitcoin has by far the most stable.
bitcoin has done nothing but rise in value.  what the fuck are referring to?

It's Szabo the number one contender for Satoshi, that explains how our understanding of economics has lead us to discover bitcoin.  That you are COMPLETELY ignorant to this subject does not speak to MY intelligence. 
Yes I remember 2008.  It was a well explained event by the likes of Szabo and Nash.  Economic philosophers whos literature I am familiar with and have read

You have to show it won't break bitcoin's security equilibrium and you can't and you have to show users would value bitcoin over other alts for low value transactions and there is no reason for them to if they can exchange near instantly and costlessly. 
Ur argument is circular and with no basis.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:57:01
I can't really have a reasonable dialogue with you if you insist that to not change is change.  The semantics there destroy any mutual inquiry.
I understand that players are suggesting that we need to scale bitcoin to keep the nature of it the same, but from an economic science perspective there is already the belief that users that entered bitcoin did so with a 1mb cap, and that is the reality. 
I understand that we might want to suggest that these users felt the cap would be removed in the future, but science and specifically economics does not view present day prices like this.
So I get the rational, but you must be careful how you state the premise or it will not line up with the founding fathers of economics such as Smith, Hayek, and Nash (and now Szabo no doubt).
In order to bend core, you must ground your reason in these peoples arguments, as they have laid the grounds for our understanding of economics.  
And yes the vast majority of big-blockers feel that bitcoin must be scaled to encourage growth of the network and consequently price, and such move won't be accepted by core, because that is an attempt to target the soundness, which should only ever be done by the markets (as per Hayek's advice).

@_date: 2016-07-14 17:47:44
You know bitcoin has a 21 million "artificial" cap right?
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:03:11


My point is that they both effect the price, which effectively a metric of soundness, ie what one can purchase over time.


It's not.  Of course there are other factors in play as well, but if all of a sudden Satoshi came in an somehow double the supply again, we would see a corresponding effect on price.
But you do attend to something relevant.  When the supply is locked, the markets can foresee the effects of this, and so future halenvings will likely have less and less effect on the price.  Its not the inflation schedule that matters in this sense so much as the predictability of it. This is also true with the block size cap.  Its not the cap or algorithm that matters, but the predictability of it.
For this reason, trying to target and optimal cap and changing the existing one, is basically like opening pandora's box. The markets would never know if this parameter was predictable, or if over the years we might debate it again.  This is what will effect the soundness of the money, and the markets certainty on the future quality.
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:11:06
If we 1) suggest that bitcoin's fees are rising...then 2) We are admitting there is users willing to pay for this...and so 3) We cannot assume this is a bad thing.
If your end goals is most users, I don't think its a good strategy.  What should our goal be?  My goal is not to make bitcoin the universal currency.  My goal is to bring our global financial system into order, and therefore bring about Nash's concept of Ideal Money.
In order for this to happen, we need MAJOR players to adopt bitcoin, here I am thinking of, for example, central banks and nations.  And for this to happen, there cannot be any uncertainty in regard to the transaction capacity.
It has to be locked, so that these players KNOW for all time exactly what they are getting in to.
And so yes, it might very well be, that I am suggesting, the average joe/jane citizen, might not be wanting to use bitcoin on a daily basis. 
But we can't say just because such users leave bitcoin, that it will fail.  If they leave because fees are high, this is also to suggest that bitcoin is valued higher than today.

No hold on here.  There is literature on economics from the great philosophers of it.  There is also academic text books and essays on the subject. I am asking if you have ever read a single one, because your general sentiments fly in the face of everyone I have ever read (I myself DO claim to have read such books and will list them if need be).

Its not MY argument that is incomplete rather it is those that are hastily trying to scale. 


In a way you are correct to point this out yet would should understand that in basic terms it is that increased demand increases the price.


Exactly, and so these proposals are not based on sound reason.

Me and Brahm share the same view on fees it seems:  they are a sign of value.
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:25:10
Yes I can see the truth of this and I didn't mean to imply it.  But its an interesting phenomenon, to support bitcoin, which is like a sort of ultra rational experiment, that highlights the concept that only the markets can attain ultimate pricing/valuation knowledge, or in other words the individual cannot predict the prices of commodities, yet these people simultaneously believe that it was their own intelligence and foresight that caused them to benefit in this way.
Let's say for example, Szabo got into bitcoin early, I don't think you would hear him claim it was intelligence, but more so luck.  Of course this is more of a point to ones/his humility, but its also how a rational (knowledgeable) economic thinker would respond.
Andreas is all hype and emotion.  Ver is just an amazing phenomenon...
Put another way, power corrupted these people, and people with similar sentiments.

@_date: 2016-07-15 23:27:29
Yes but bitcoin is an experiment in itself that could not be tested in a lab. Notice the experiment is still blind in regard to the person that came up with it. 
For this reason, there cannot be data in regard to the future implications of a block size cap change.
This is why core is not bending to what you and others seem to feel is otherwise reason and a scientific argument

This is significant post.  I haven't specifically seen this sentiment from any other elite players (although I suspect it exists in many respects).  Here we see /nullc expresses the same conclusion that I have reached but seemingly through different paths to reach it.  A 1mb cap CAN still be used to inspire sound money. 
Sound money, should be our goal here.
Those that believe that changing the limitation would cause bitcoin to have a wider adoption and therefore a higher “price”, are effectively admitting that messing with the limit CHANGES the sound-ness of bitcoin.
Money that changes in its valution like this, cannot be considered sound, REGARDLESS if the intent or result is a money with a higher valuation.
We can clearly see the rational  here that the block-size limit debate here is Keynesian in nature.

Yes but there are many people that are interested in engaging with players that have differing opinions, but the sub was getting hammered with CLEARLY disingenuous accounts that were not just on a certain side but had clear intention to disrupt any productive discussion.
This is what I mean by "the trolling was CLEAR".
Something had to be done to bring the dialogue into order.  And for months and months r/btc was FULL of posts by disingenuous players crying foul when their only intention was to come to r/bitcoin in order to call out theymos and the mods (but not to post content or engage in dialogue ABOUT content).
Their goal was to cry censorship, not to engage in discussion.  
Seems quite obvious that no mods in this sub cared that a debate with two or more sides could go on. Thats not what was happening.  What was happening is 90% of the posts were content-less and clear disinformation.
You might suggest other players were calling those that disagree with them trolls, but it doesn't fit my personality and my history to suggest that I myself am guilty of that...
I want to discuss Ideal Money with players, I WANT back and forth dialogue on the subject, which means I am actively seeking those that don't necessarily agree with my view.
Can't do that with r/btc or the brigade that was constantly trying to disrupt this sub...they wouldn't and won't engage in sincere dialogue, they won't address the content and now my posts don't show up there.

There can't be a researched based opinion because bitcoin is cutting edge. This is why core isn't accepting such proposals as valid.  It is also why attempting to optimize bitcoin's block size cap is an arbitrary endeavor. Such arbitrary-ness is Keynesian in nature and the exact folly Hayek warned us against.

I've pondered it yes.  But its Nash that did the real meditation, 20 years he talked about this and we ignored him.  He came up with this in the 50's, which is why we thought he went crazy.  Rather he was telling us he had the mathematical capability to bring peace to the world.
Nash's ideal money EFFECTIVELY (basically, or "in other words") says, but without saying the word bitcoin....that bitcoin will arise, an international e-currency with a stably issued supply...
and this will cause the global currencies to enter a new era, because the central banks will be forced onto a new stage, a new game, in which the must compete vs each other for market value...
Traditionally fiat didn't need to compete in this way, and so our governments tell us that inflation is a good thing...
Ideal Money doesn't have inflation, and so the ultimate result of this process we are watching is going to be Ideal Money.
bitcoin is the catalyst, what Nash seems to refer to as asymptotically Ideal Money.

I think there is more to it than people give it credit.  Imagine you are Satoshi, in that you KNOW that you can code this system, but you are thinking about the parameters.  You know if you get the parameters right this will be a success, but if you get them wrong it will break and fail and perhaps it will take a very long time before people decide to trust such a proposal again....
Its a very serious decision if you are sincere....
Part of your question is answered by "no".  That is to say the drops in the rewards, simple need to be predictable.  The markets, whether the users, or the miners, or the businesses etc., will adjust to basically whatever schedule is laid forth.
It can be said though, that in the beginning, such adjustments won't be as easy, or noted, or relevant as future ones.
There is more % of the total amount of bitcoin released at the beginning, and with the currency in bootstrap mode the halving is going to have a bigger impact than what is already perceived for years in the future.
I think then there is consideration in regard to the first few havenings.  That 4 years, and so 3 halvings or so in the first ~10years seems like enough time to transition bitcoin from a test phase to a ready for mass acceptance (notice I don't say adoption).
In other words I think 10 years cycles might be too abrupt, as with 1 year cycles (with 1 year for example you don't get that psychological "thrill" that something will happen, or the feeling of bitcoin getting more scarce).
Other than that I have always felt it is a relation to the cycles of our commodities, that most people feel the mining sector cycles in four years or so, and that if we aggregate all of the know costs of productions of fairly stably priced produced commodities then it would should that bitcoin is a very close match to that.
I think beyond that, simplicity was the key and a halving series decided the numbers.  I was told 21 million has a relation to the supply of a certain set of the currency in the world.

The circular argument you point out is correct, which makes solving the problem difficult. And the rest of the questions are very relevant and Nash's poses them and goes over the rational.  The population has given the valuation it has, so it IS valued dearly.  The population tries to save but economic crisis destorys their ability.
SOMEHOW we need to get on a standard which cannot be pardoned.

I HAVE read MANY books on the subject of economics.  CRYPTO economics is but a BRANCH of a well established science.  You have ZERO understanding of this subject, and you keep posting about it as if you know something.
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:59:02
Not a single person in this community has read a stitch of economics literature, it is simply filled with people like you who are willing to argue points with zero basis.  You make my point perfectly.

I didn't at all mean to imply that transaction capacity wouldn't be reached. I'm fully aware that bitcoin will function above capacity if the capacity isn't raised.

Are you planning on participating in discussion that involves content or are you simply here to troll me?

You have to read all his works, to truly be able to read his works.  I have troubles reading it because I want to be at the end before I get there.  Just mind blowing what this man knows.  Absolutely mind blowing.  I don't know how people get this smart. He's decoding the history of our evolution from all angles. I don't know how he still has more to say on the subject.  I have no friends or peers I can relate to this information with. I can't hold a candle to this man but when I talk to my friends on any of these subjects its impossible for me to hide the fact that I don't subscribe to anything they are saying.

You have a degree in economics and this is your argument?  
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:35:35
Because you have no life. Nothing more valuable to do with your time than disrupt a community in which you don't belong and have zero intention of contributing to. And now your account is marked for all the sincere people to see :) And you can't help yourself but continue to show this.

If you give people control of these things they will abuse it, thats the point.  How to bring stability without a control mechanism?

Yes but if we scale bitcoin's block size to be a coffee money, we destroy bitcoin's gold like properties that will bring this about.  So now you might understand why I am pushing to be heard, and what it really means that was manipulating my ability to post and discuss this content.
