Asking for advise and info on better ways to farm bitcoin is not begging

I can push 100 hash with my device what would be the best cpu mining site? I use Minergate and i feel im not getting the best out of it.

Thank you. Everything helps.

Your right. My topic was to better myself at bitcoin since I've only been doing this for 4 months. 
So do you have any suggestions about any websites to start a pool with bitcoin. 
 Or are you here just to rant..

Wow. You really think bitcoin would last if eth xmr sold out and left. No. Bitcoin would collapse from network effect

Im using Minergate pushing 60h/s using hardware and been trying to make enough to get a contract to online mine. 
If anybody knows a better or faster way to mine please let me know.

Right but i was thinking since bitcoin is at it's low at the moment i would get the most i can and the best way before it spicks up again. When bitcoin hits 10k=1 bitcoin it will be even harder to utilize my energy. Right now technically ill be generating more bitcoin but less value at this time... Plz correct me if im wrong
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:23:44
Ill try that. Thank you
@_date: 2018-07-15 03:15:52
And i want to make that holding bag now so when it does spike ill be set.

Bitcoin cryptocurrency it's all the same just not the value. Bitcoin can be increased in a pool with hash rate with cpu to help a online pool. If your in a pool for btc.
Ive been mining XMR on minergate for bitcoin. So in technicality yes you can mine btc with cpu through xmr. Ive been doing for 4 month.

Accepting Donations for Bitcoin to help get my first online mine pool. I've been mining on hardware but it is taking forever. If anybody could help out anything would help get me going.
                 Please and Thank you

Valuing a cryptocurrency
Valuing a cryptocurrency is difficult. Similar to metals such as copper or silver, cryptocurrencies do not pay a dividend. 
Copper has value because people are expected to need it on an ongoing basis for industrial purposes. Cryptocurrencies are considered to have value because people are expected to need them to store/send/receive payment in situations where traditional currencies are unsuitable, impractical, restricted or incur uncompetitive fees. 
It is true that if everyone stopped using any particular cryptocurrency, it would lose its value. This is similar in nature to social networks such as Facebook: Facebook would lose all value if everyone suddenly stopped using it and switched to a competitor. However, owners of Facebook stock can sleep at night secure in the knowledge that the inconveniences of switching to a competitor are high enough that this can only happen gradually. This is a concept known as the network effect. 
Some would argue that all cryptocurrencies are worthless because infinite clones of Monero or Bitcoin could be created. There is nothing to prevent anyone from creating a Monero clone and calling it NeoMonero. But the point is that the network effect of users adopting the original Monero and not the clone is what gives Monero coins scarcity compared to the coins of a clone. A clone of Facebook or eBay would be useless because everyone is already using the original. Scarcity therefore comes not only from the unique features of a particular cryptocurrency, but also from the user adoption of that cryptocurrency. 
Once a currency gets started, it starts to develop a degree of stability based on past expectations of its purchasing power. This is a concept familiar to economists and is known as the Regression theory of money. 
Without Monero or any other cryptocurrency Bitcoin would lose it's value. 
To tell me bitcoin is bitcoin is illogical.

      Xmr.        Bcn.       Eth. 
It belongs in bitcoin chat. 
Bitcoin is a short term word for hundreds of different cryptocurrency.
