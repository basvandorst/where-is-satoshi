Once you commit to chowing on your genitalia it may be best to pass it rather than choke on it one more time ...
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:25:35
Yeah but how far is the look back? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:14:43
That’s awesome. I wonder how the growth rate is calculated.

When do folks start eating dicks?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:36:48
Definitely true. I work with a group of engineers and software devs and even they have issues. We have spent a lot of break room time discussing it trying to make good decisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:55:42
I think it is definitely one of possible the outcomes and it’s one thing that has held me back from going in full speed. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:36:53
Thank you for the insights. I agree that there is a lot of promise here. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:17:39
No doubt
I think I will be very cautious and tread lightly. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:07:21
I get that it would be impractical to block exits. But it seems like folks are trading it more so than using it. Maybe I haven’t seen the right data on transactions or adoption rates. 
The large transaction problem does seem like a huge issue.

Did that and watched the documentary on Netflix and I do get the rationale for the cloud ledger as a matter of fact that’s made me like the idea more but the crazy trading fury gives me pause.

I am sold on the underlying principle.  I will look into lightening to see how that deals with he transaction time problem. 
Even though this is a constrained system there are many substitutes - what keeps them from diluting value.

I have read it and liked the technicals behind the system. I am definitely taking a cautious approach. I have put a small amount into the dips mostly just to force myself to engage and try to understand the system. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:10:48
I have been buying the dips on the backside of the peak but I am beginning to think shorting was the better play. I guess I hold until I am or crypto is dead. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:34:07
That would be great. I do like the principles behind cryptos and it has the potential to become a worldwide standard that circumvents bank control. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:02:59
That will help for pos transactions for sure. I still think heavy price volatility will keep people from using it as a real currency and that’s a problem imo. Some will sit on the sidelines and wait and others will just treat it as a investment and just trade between coins both will keep merchants from going in whole hog. 
The discussions in my office are centered around tracking lead and lag between coin prices to channel trades but the time to close on a trade makes most of us hesitant as the projected gains are there but high volatility make it risky. It is never about using it as a currency ...
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:45:24
I understand that and it is a major roadblock for adoption along with the transaction time concerns. 
I do recall CCs taking the best rate over a period of time before they finalized the conversion but now it’s more or less instantaneous.
The volatility will keep businesses from using cryptos or at a minimum severely limit adoption.

Isn’t that what happens at the point if sale even now with foreign currencies? When I am outside the states and purchase with my debit or credit card the conversion happens at the pos at the current rate for RMB to USD as an example.
