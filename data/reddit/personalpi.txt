Ask Wesley snipes how the club worked out for him. He was paying taxes like everyone else and decided to test out the anti-tax thing and the IRS put their boot up his ass.
I think if anything they are worried about how to adapt to it. You are talking a MAJOR overhaul of the entire country if BTC were to become a primary currency as people suggest. How many of us learned *anything* about money in school? It’s a situation that has no contingency plan and they are scrambling.

I was mostly referring to the articles just a few months ago, which is pretty much where they left it. [This]( is one article I found really quickly on CNN from a few days ago. I agree that they have pretty much been ignoring it. If you read through the articles, most of them are about Facebook's Libra and how (the article even says this) bitcoin wouldn't be where it is right now if it wasn't for Facebook.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:48:32
Damn that sucks because cash app is super easy and you can immediately transfer it anywhere. The only time I mess with coinbase is if I want to buy btc or ltc so I pretty much keep it on there anyways and they tie my money up the same way (I use bank transfer). I asked a friend of mine that uses coinbase a ton and he said that if he uses his card instead of bank transfer it doesn’t place any kind of hold.

Just don’t use it for storing anything substantial. I just keep a little bit on coinbase that I can spend easily if I need to, rest is in cold storage. Good rule of thumb is don’t put anything into BTC you can’t afford to lose. I follow that but on exchanges I make sure the amount on there is low enough to where if the exchange gets hacked/shuts down then I can just chuckle and move on without worrying about it.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:01:16

Good info ^^
Did coinbase change something with their bank deposits? I’m pretty sure the way it used to work is you do the transfer and can immediately spend it on BTC/etc, but you couldn’t transfer anything off of there until it all cleared. Been forever since I used that, though.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:40:31
You can initiate the deposit on coinbase and if it hasn’t cleared you can purchase BTC whenever you want. You won’t be able to transfer it off of coinbase (like to your own hardware wallet) until everything has cleared through the bank.

Tax evasion is illegal... at least in the US.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:29:10
-	There are only 3 exchanges in the US. They can shut those down but good luck on the others located outside the US.
-	There are plenty of ways to use crypto, you just haven’t researched it enough. I don’t use a bank at all, I could care less if they shut the banks or exchanges down, it’s not going to affect me.
-	The system has its issues here and there, nobody is trying to say it’s perfect. It’s a very, very young system. Everyone on here will be worm food before we are even close to mining all of the BTC. Even then, it will still take time.
-	If you are just in it for the get-rich-quick-buy-a-Lambo thing, then you are making a mistake.

1) The definition of money differs for everyone. I love strawberries and would love them as payment, thus it is now money to me and anyone that happens to have strawberries.
2) Everything fluctuates depending on world events. Look at USD, Yen, oil, corn, Rice, etc.
3) Of course it's unstable, it is very young. All of the BTC won't be fully mined until after all of us are dead and gone.
There are whales, but how is that any different from large corporations such as banks that already manipulate the markets. People end up in jail all the time for market manipulation.

Another major problem (see my other comments in this thread) is bitcoin is too anonymous. One of the biggest hurdles is that you can’t associate it with a person (if they do it right). I don’t foresee any major retail companies like Best Buy, target, etc being interested in bitcoin as is. As much as I would love to see it happen, they are definitely going to be more interested in something way less private.
The only exception would be if they refused it for online orders. If you have to come into the store to use bitcoin or cash, we can track that and tie it to a person. More companies are much more interested in e-commerce though than in store purchases.

Internally (at least at the companies I worked at) Apple Pay and Samsung pay show up as a normal credit card purchase. There’s no way to tell it was from Apple Pay or Samsung pay. All of the software is made for USD only, it doesn’t expect for ANY other currency. A huge part of my job was investigating fraud. If you used a rewards card, gift card, credit card, etc I could pull the entire history for it for the entire country. So not only are you having to deal with customer facing issues (which are probably the easiest to fix) you now have to figure out a way to integrate blockchains into the software. They are stubborn and aren’t going to want to pay for the chainalysis software so they will spend way more in money and time developing their own solution.
Most of these retail companies are still running on OS/2 for their backend infrastructure and the setup they have “just works”.
@_date: 2019-08-18 04:07:07
Yes. The fees are lower and you can place limit orders.
@_date: 2019-08-20 23:34:59
I don't think I've ever watched a YouTube video about BTC. The best resources IMO are from reading on reddit and searching around online to learn about what bitcoin is and how it works. Not just you click a button and numbers change on a screen, but research HOW the network works.
Edit: Also I'm a hands on type learner. Experiment with very small dollar amounts to get a feel for what is going on and what to expect. Don't just load up a wallet and try to move 100 BTC around on your first transaction.
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:01:00
You would need at least $4.5 billion (USD) to even get started. If they can't figure out how to create an account on coinbase and use coinbase earn then they shouldn't be messing with it anyways.
Not saying coinbase is the best, but for the people that are just learning about cryptocurrencies then coinbase is a good and safe entry point for them.

No matter what you use, it's to retain the security features. The $5 bill is the lowest denomination that has security features similar to a $100 bill. It will pass the "pen test" and initial visual inspection from a cashier with ease, and it feels like real money because it is real money. The $1 doesn't really have any security features worth noting and would look awkward printing a $100 plate on it.

1. Yes, but you would have a better chance at winning the lottery. Plus, you would need the proceeds from the lottery to purchase enough processing power to even begin. (Edit: I didn't say they would be successful).
2. Someone can probably answer this better than me.
3. No, even once all of the BTC is mined the miners will collect funds from transaction fees.
4. Every currency is like that.
5. To each their own. Bitcoin has come a long way in its short lifespan, I think everyone can agree on that no matter what their viewpoints are. Try going to an apple subreddit and ask them their viewpoints on android. Banks and the media have a time and place for things.
6. Always better to ask questions! Especially when it comes to bitcoin. There is no customer service, there is nobody to help you if you lose funds (depending on circumstances, but probably not) or your money gets stolen.

Easy, fast and let's you instantly send your BTC anywhere you want. I wouldn't use it as a wallet though, just as a way to get BTC and get it into your own wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:14:31
said what I was going to say. Find what works best for you. You want a wallet where you have to write down the "seed phrase" which is a set of random words. If you don't have that, then you don't actually own any bitcoin.
I might catch flak for this but for beginners if you want a desktop wallet I would recommend Exodus (Jaxx looks easy to use also but I've never actually used it so I'm not going to vouch for it). For mobile maybe BRD wallet, Green wallet, or trust wallet. The mobile ones are going to be on the app store but for desktops be careful you don't download a fake wallet that will steal your BTC. Post here if you are unsure (we would rather see you asking if a website is legit instead of asking how to get your money back because you downloaded a fraudulent wallet).
Those are all free. Once you have YOUR BTC in a wallet with the seed phrase then you can look into other more secure wallets. Personally I would recommend a hardware wallet such as trezor or ledger (I have both and have used both) but they cost money. Same rules as above apply, there are fake wallets and fake websites out there.
You are your own bank, you have to deploy your own security measures, because nobody can help you get your money back unless it's something weird like the wallet messed up and switched to the test network or something similar.

This is why you don’t use those stupid cards that “allow you to spend your crypto.” There isn’t a single one that ACTUALLY uses crypto, they are just Visa based cards anyone can get (think pre paid debit card). They take your crypto and convert it to Fiat for an outrageous fee. They are completely against BTC.
Also I hope you don’t use that card much if you are in the US as they are a tax headache. BTC isn’t officially money in the US. It’s property. Any time you swipe that card = more paperwork for you. I’m not 100% sure if you are outside the US though, you may be in a better position depending on which country you are in.

There’s really only three options, they are either dead, in prison, or simply do not want to be known.
Depending on the country you can even rule out prison (some US prisons have tablets for inmates to use in their cell, for instance).
It doesn’t really matter who they are. Things have evolved beyond that and it’s clear they never had an interest in being known. Let them be.

Forget that cash in your hand exists. All you are left with is your bank account where you can transfer money around electronically (surely you don’t pay everything in cash). Rent, internet, phone bill, etc are all paid electronically for lots of people. There you go, bitcoin is the same thing (as simply put as I can think of).
Of course you need to do more reading than that before using it.

Now is a good time to read up on and purchase a hardware wallet before you start buying again.

Supply and demand. If enough of their employees want to start getting paid in bitcoin they just might do it. Until then, it's not even worth wasting their time thinking about.

I wonder how many times this has happened?
I’d love to watch the security video of them stealing a door stop bigger than them.

Saw another post similar to this not long ago. Basically you know how you see stuff about text [number] to [number] to donate $5 to Red Cross or whatever and it gets billed to your phone bill? Apparently in some countries they have this set up and you can somehow buy BTC that way. I don’t know any more specifics than that.

KuCoin (probably my favorite), Coinbase Pro (second favorite), Kraken, not sure if the binance US is up and running completely yet. I haven't used it and have no plans to.
@_date: 2019-09-17 19:07:34
You don’t have to buy a whole btc. Just buy a little at a time. Whatever you feel comfortable budgeting out.
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:25:35
If you are in the US, the easiest place to use is probably (unfortunately) Coinbase. Don't get me wrong, it's a well put together site and everything works great, just there are better options out there once you explore more into bitcoin.
As far as getting paid, so you would set up a coinbase account and link your bank account to it (if you wish to cash out to your bank). The person paying you can send funds to your bitcoin address on coinbase and from there you can convert it to USD pretty much instantly and transfer it to your bank.
There are two problems you could run into:
1) Your bank may not be crypto friendly. There are plenty of banks out there that outright decline anything crypto related and some will close your bank accounts, so do your research on which bank you want to use (don't call them and ask, research online).
2) You said the person sending you the bitcoin is sending it for legitimate reasons. That's fine and all as long as that is what is going on. I sold something earlier and got paid in BTC, no issues at all. You could run into issues if it's obviously for something not legitimate or if the person sending you the funds acquired them in a non-legitimate way (such as stolen, from drug transactions on the markets, gambling sites, etc). If anything like that can be tied to the funds sent to you, then coinbase will freeze your account (which includes your funds).

Wait to see how what goes? They just told you. You are wasting your time, but if it’s fun to you then go for it. Just don’t deposit any money, don’t put in any passwords, seed words, nothing.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Only you can answer that question. We don't know your situation, what other expenses you may have, etc. The best advice I could tell you is don't put all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:09:52
I actually managed to find a physical store that accepts crypto. Sticker on the door said bitcoin accepted here. Figured I’d go in and find something to buy just because. Come to find out it’s BCH only. Asked them about it, they said they’ve been involved in BCH for “over ten years”(what??). Tried explaining that BTC and BCH were completely different things, but they weren’t having it and told me to research bitcoin.com (notice they said .com instead of .org). Noped the hell out of there with the quickness.

You have to use separate accounts on here to upvote and comment on your own stuff because nobody reads it. Do you do the same on twitter with your 1 like?

Yea $150 would show up for sure. Which wallet are you using that it is not showing up in? And you sent it from coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:01:54
I've never used it, but I've heard of it. I thought it was Japan only, but apparently they service the US also. It has a mixed bag of reviews just like all the other exchanges:

Cool story, not going to happen, move on over to and discuss it there then. This has absolutely zero impact on Bitcoin or anything else in the world.

Avast has always had some weird issues with electrum. It's more than likely a false positive. You should open an issue on their github page that it is flagging so they can notify avast.

Did you send a small amount? Some wallets (such as wasabi) have a dust threshold. If the amount is below that it will not show up in your wallet. You can adjust the threshold in settings.

No. There’s an “official impeachment inquiry” like 6 times a week. Nobody gives a shit about that.

I haven't heard that. Are you talking about Libra? Either way, they have a lot of employees and there's no telling what kind of BS Facebook is feeding them about Bitcoin. Like I said, unless lots of employees are demanding payment in Bitcoin, then no company in their right mind is just going to spend time and money implementing it for no reason.

Never go to .com, only the .org

Ignore all you want, they don't care. Got a new job? "That's cool we'll go ahead and collect half of your paycheck for you". Tax refund? "Thanks we will keep that". Only applies if you are in America though, you know land of the free and all :)

There is a scary amount of people out there messing with bitcoin who have no idea what it is, how it works, or even the basics of how a computer works. All they know is the man on the news said bitcoin is popular and they have a computer running a windows and theirs is cooler than everyone else's because the Taskbar is blue and start button is green. They stopped doing updates on it 10 years ago because it made their AOL email slow. 
Everyone wants btc to be popular but in reality lots of people just get frustrated and delete it all because they Google bitcoin and type their credit card number in and now there's no bitcoin in their bank account. These people are probably better off letting someone like a bank secure their money. Not saying a bank is completely safe, but they are better off there instead of getting ripped to shreds messing with BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:13:33
The part I liked is where satoshi invented the bitcoin software, it even showed a website that said download bitcoin. Where do I download my bitcoin???

Yep I tested out the security of my authy account and pretended basically I lost everything. I only had to provide a few basic details and they restored my access. Not only that, they also found an old authy account I forgot about and merged the codes. If authy has access to all your 2FA codes on their service, safe to assume everyone does.

The name DropBit sounds like a great way to lose money fast. I'm assuming you are part of that "company" - you guys should revisit the drawing board. Oh and fire whoever in marketing decided the best way to advertise is shady ads on reddit posts. Just another fly by night steal your money scam. Plenty of them out there.
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:59:52
Well yea it runs by itself just fine if you ignore the fact that people are running it.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:44:22
Dude/dudette, you said that you have read warnings about coinbase, but you still used it. You clearly did some shady shit with your BTC and got called on it. Coinbase is no different from a normal bank, everything you do is sent to the IRS and they can freeze your funds at will. You ignored all of the warnings and chose to proceed. You are preaching to the choir here.

This is a neat project but it's a long ways away. The launch that was canceled last night and rescheduled was just the beginning of a series of tests. This one is to test deploying a large number of satellites without them all crashing into each other. Its going to be about 20-25 test launches minimum before the project even begins.

Didn't mean to sound like an asshole earlier. Sorry bout that fam. Anyways, stolen credit cards are EVERYWHERE and extremely easy to get ahold of in bulk. Not really fair to pick on purse.io when any platform you can imagine involving money is used to launder money around. Like someone else said, it's a drop in the ocean. There's an extremely good chance you and everyone here has possessed and passed counterfeit money at some point, hopefully inadvertently. Same thing with purse, some stuff might be legit and others not. No way to know.
