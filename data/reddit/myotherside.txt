Booty's Street Food also accepts BTC.  I haven't heard of anywhere else except for the antiques shop mentioned in the article.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:53:09
Trust me, I understand this.  But it is a massive barrier to broader adoption.  It's an unfortunate situation.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:18:42
A simple BTC withdrawal delay after a password change would fix this issue.
That would be a feature that I would enable, if it was available.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:35:08
A simple disabling of instant transfers after a password change would have avoided all of this.  You would have a chance to see the money come out of your bank account before the BTC was withdrawn, and you could have notified coinbase.
This should absolutely be an option.  Your situation will repeat itself in the future with others that are compromised, and Coinbase has a profit motive to avoid fraudulent transfers and chargebacks.

I sold enough in the $600's to cover my original fiat investment and I let the rest ride.  Later on I lost a good portion of that in gox trying to learn how to trade.  Since then I have been slowly investing more and learning more fundamentals about trading.  TradingView, investopedia, and babypips and have been very helpful and I've pulled off some nice trades that have mitigated the effect of the bear market for me.  I have ended up with a similar fiat equivalent (and moar BTC!).  Still have a ways to go to make up for the coins I lost in gox, but I am confident I will get there.
BTC has been a really fun obsession for me.  And a great learning experience about so many things.
Thanks for the tip.  I will claim it and pass it on!
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:47:36
Quite the opposite.  People sold into oblivion on Gox before they went belly-up, so there is probably a lot of fiat tied up waiting to get back in.  I imagine most would withdraw and put their btc in cold storage or into another exchange.  Especially if we are in a strong bull market by the time they have access to them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:58:21
39 BTC.  Deposited over 20 and got the rest from trading.  
Still somewhat in denial, and hoping upon hope that someone will buy them out.  I don't care if it takes a year to be able to withdraw as long as I can trade and eventually be made whole.  
But for now I'm kissing it goodbye.  All I have is 0.1BTC payout from my miner.

I bought in the $200's when that was the new ATH.  Held through the drop until the next bubble and was handsomely rewarded.
Although I do wish I had sold then rebought, the sunk cost made me that much more interested in watching the market movements and eventually I started trading. I piled more money in once the market recovered and I imagine there are lots of people that bought in around the last ATH that will be doing the same once they realize the rollercoaster is back in action.

It's plausible if the wallet backups were encrypted and they took physical possession of them but are unable to decrypt them.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:26:43
Coinbase makes me wait a week for most transactions.  A mandatory withdrawal delay or disabling instant purchases after a password change would have fixed OP's problem.  
Security IS a big issue with cryptocurrency.  The currency exchangers should have better safeguards in place to prevent transactions that may cause them chargebacks - it's their profit incentive.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:20:49
If it is a legitimate chargeback it provides Coinbase with a financial incentive to protect against this sort of hack.
A simple withdrawal delay after a password change would go a long way in preventing this.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:23:08
A withdrawal delay after a password change would have likely prevented this fraud.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:19:17
If there is a more complex scheme of cold storage requiring multiple keys, or if the paper wallets are BIP protected, then all the Feds would have to do is seize the paper wallets.  They may not be able to decipher the private key but still prevent Gox from accessing them.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:39:51
If we want mass adoption of BTC it needs to be able to be accessed securely on Windows.
I know it sucks, but it's true.  (I run Linux)

UASF chain split didn't happen - it remains in consensus.
Bcash intentionally forked, after saying it was due to UASF, but the miners who forked were also signaling for segwit via BIP91 (they created their own reason for forking because they just wanted so badly to fork, lolz)
So yes.  Bcash is an altcoin.  The main chain consensus includes UASF.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:39:25
UASF was never intended to fork.  It was made to split the chain and reorg it back into one chain, or fail and produce an alt.  It's pretty clever, actually.
So yeah, it's not consistent to compare UASF to BU or Classic and claim some sort of bias or grievance.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:41:30
LOFL what did you read a liberal identity politics guide and decided that you would just call everyone racist that disagrees with you?  
Didn't work for Hillary, isn't working for you. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:36:49
Yep, if they don't activate in time then the NYA will dissolve like sugar in water.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:51:48
POW mining being centrally controlled is a fatal flaw in the ecosystem AND algorithm.  You just refuse to recognize it.  You may find success in the short term but I will be mining the shit out of luke's coin if it comes down to a real ideological split between centralized corporate controlled development and a true decentralized cypherpunk currency.  One might pump like a madman and be economically dominant for a time but if it's not resilient and censorship resistant it will eventually die.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:30:22
If the economic majority jumped off a bridge, would you follow?

Shamson, is that you?
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:39:52
Actually, their cabal controls a very significant percentage of the network, enough to block popular protocol improvements, stifle innovation and force users to split off just so they can maintain a decentralized system.  Hate to break it to you, but that is the situation we find ourselves in.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:10:32
Yeah.  That's my point.  You should double down and try to figure out a way to call everyone who disagrees with you sexist too. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:31:16
That's what Core is doing
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:43:26
 I mean, it doesn't matter anyway because you got your smear in by framing everyone who "think it's generally a bad idea that it exists" as being racist.
Seriously.  Total nonsense.  This is a completely dishonest tactic.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:05:47
I don't know if you have ever heard the saying, but it's pretty flexible.  If everyone else is doing something stupid, do you follow?  
If the economic majority supports a corporate centralized development process, I won't follow them.  Honey Badger will catch up to them, even if they try to fork it asunder.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:33:27
Not really sure what your point is here.  At least he calls it an altcoin instead of trying to pretend it's going to be bitcoin a la seg2x
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:07:12
It's a cryptoanarchist currency what in the heck do you expect?
Honey badger don't care about your desire for structured governance.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:48:34
I'll call it bitcoin if I want to call it bitcoin.  I don't think 8MB corporate controlled "bitcoin" is bitcoin.  If I have to choose between that and luke's alt-pow chain, I may call luke's coin bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:08:22
OK kid, let me talk down to you for a minute.
Oh wait, I don't care to.  Enjoy your dumps.  Please, create more uncertainty.

"We" are going to activate Segwit.
Then some will probably try to fork and fail.
Most just want Segwit, which is great because "We" are doing exactly that.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:13:50
I don't think he expect that it would retain the same value, especially not in the short term.  His prognosis is that it would remain viable long after centralized solutions are co-opted by the state and capital interests to serve their interests above the interests of the users.  It's a long-term play on the idea that bitcoin will fail, just like every other altcoin.  And he is basing his idea on evidence of a corporate takeover to co-opt bitcoin for use as a retail payment system and not sovereign e-cash.  You can agree or disagree with the logic or rip it apart however you want, but that is pretty much what is going on regardless of whether you agree or disagree.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:50:54
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:01:43
No, if the optimization is patented, the it is the responsibility of the protocol to adjust to prevent this state intervention in the security of the chain.  Otherwise I would agree.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:49:42
What happens if we chain split over a schedule dispute?  Trying to stare down UASF will show bad faith and undermine the agreement. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:45:53
Damn right
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:59:53
The NY agreement will likely fall apart.  If it does, UASF will be there.  If it doesn't, GREAT!  The whole point is to force a deadline to scale.  You massively understimate the shift in consensus that will happen if there is any hiccup in the NY agreement, which is far from certain to succeed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:20:28
Actually, it's the NY agreement that probably isn't going to happen, and UASF will probably come much sooner than working, stable and tested segwit2x code coming online with the consensus needed to push it through.  It's laughable, really.  UASF is pretty much inevitable at this point.  Don't give false hope to miners.  They only have one rational choice - signal segwit and leave their contentious hard fork for another day. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:45:33
Wouldn't that be nice.  Maybe we should all fly to China and grovel in front of Jihan.

It's more than a small patch and the development timeline will reflect that.  Just wait until mid-July and see.
