I know I’m late to the party but I could swear when I sent some bitcoins from coinbase and checked on blockchain.info the transaction was batched...
(If I understand batching correctly it’s a transaction form 1 address to many)

What makes you think that? (Genuine question)

Yeah, you “can.” Just like you “can” get from Madrid to Beijing on foot while blindfolded. The point is you can’t without it being a stupid waste of time and resources.
When I say you can’t mine bitcoin with a normal computer I mean:
1. It will take you an astronomical amount of time to mine a single block on your own, and thus is a waste of time so you “can’t realistically”
2. Will generate microscopical revenue if used as part of a pool, and thus is a waste of time so you “can’t realistically”
Words can have different/implied meanings depending on context which seems like your level of reading comprehension doesn’t let you pick up on. 
The whole argument was about the fact that you completely forgot that hardware has to be manufactured (which uses electricity), then claimed that we already have all the hardware anyway in the form of “normal computers” (which is NOT what is used for hashing on the bitcoin network, ASICs are), then claimed that only a small percentage of miners use ASICs (which isn’t true, most hashing power on the bitcoin network comes from ASICs), then justified your position by citing sales of video cards (which are used for mining alts and NOT bitcoin).
Hardware has to be manufactured for mining bitcoin which costs electricity. Period. Stop trying to weasel out of this, this is weak.

Pathetic attempt at dodging a response. Good riddance.

He’s talking about mining bitcoin you dumb cunt. You can’t mine bitcoin with “just regular computers that can mine.” Read the damn comments you’re replying to ffs.

Oh the irony.
