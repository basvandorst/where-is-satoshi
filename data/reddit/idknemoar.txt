Crypto is tech and tech is what I’m trying to help this awesome charity with.  Please consider donating, it will help so many find their place in the world.  The big giant charities get most of the money, so it would be awesome for this smaller one to make their dream come true. 
I would really love it if everyone who can afford to donate even just a few dollars towards this wonderful charity would.  It would mean a lot to me and it would mean even more to the many lives this organization helps daily.  In the spirit of the holiday season, please consider at least a small donation!  Even if you can’t give, it would be awesome if you would share this link to others. 
Thank you in advance, 
“The My Possibilities Center for Lifelong Learning is a bold vision that will come to life with the support and investment of local communities. Adults with IDD are an integral part of our community and are eager to live, work, play, and enjoy life just like everyone else. Their lives may be different, but—in their own way—each has demonstrated time and time again a resiliency of spirit and a burning desire to live a more fulfilling life.
The My Possibilities Center for Lifelong Learning is the educational opportunity that will help our HIPsters realize their greatest potential.”
