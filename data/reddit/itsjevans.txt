The reason I'm shifting away from Eodus

Edited the post to try and alleviate cries of FUD/Shill/Snake in the grass (but to be fair it doesn't bother me)
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:14:34
Totally just noticed the logos
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:51:03
The first thing I thought of was inflation
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:20
Clicked and was not dissapointed
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:29:10
(As in the reason for trying to send my balance)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:28:54
That’s exactly what I’m trying to do!
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:50:15
Thank you for this, this makes so much sense
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:28
Yep- as mentioned,
Trying to convert BTC to LTC
But the TX fees to send to Shapeshift are super mega fun large
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:08:24
I don’t have (and don’t intend to buy) any BCH
Post aug 1st Crypto dude here
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:41
I'm pretty much shifting to LTC/ETH at the moment (And I'm in no way a Bcash fan)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:30:52
This is exactly what I was looking for - thanks I’ll take a look when I get back to my desk
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:40:54
The not bothering continues 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:14:02
(Although I did spend a good 10 minutes writing those replies, maybe it does bother me - god I love the internet)
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:08:37
Bought BCH through Shapeshift during a the first BTC/BCH dip/pump and dump, sold almost all of it for a loss when BTC headed back up (don't intend to buy anymore BCH so my original comment stands in my opinion, but happy to send over screenshots of my trading history/CoinTracking pie chart screenshot if you disagree
Really don't think the whole BTC/BCH petty fighting is helpful for anyone so trying to stay as under-exposed to BTC as possible - hence the me looking to shift by BTC to LTC

Do I have to send my balance to a Segwit address first? (So won’t be an issue for future transactions but will be a massive transaction fee for this transaction?)
Sorry new to the ins and outs of segwit!
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:12:53
Diversification is smart imo
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:42:42
Just signed up and can confirm BCH comes above BTC in the list

My anxiety is at an ATH

Curse these tiny stubbly legs
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:39:53
think it was acronymed to fit the meme
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:28:48
I did not realise this
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:13:55
Only invest what you can afford (and stand) to loose
Investing little by little may be a better option
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:06:47
Don't listen to anyone
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:48:21
It depends what you're intending to do with it,
Long term investment or short term?
Short term I'd think you'd get hammered with fees etc
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:06:48
I’ve pretty much given up on believing either side
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:51:08
I tried it today and had a BCH wallet created as the main (and appeared first on the list)
Unless it’s randomised?
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:21:06
Glad I sold this morning (BCH-ETH / waiting for a good time to slip to BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:51:57
I’ve always had a great experience with LocalBitcoins (and it’s cheaper than Coinbase)
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:22:34
It's how I started but have learnt it's better to be in control of your own private keys (especially with all this forking going on)
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:50:25
All or nothing����

Can we take a moment to appreciate “Lord Hodlemort”
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:31:11
Have you or any more info?
From what I’ve read Bitshares is another coin?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:41:12
I'm interested to any replies to this
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:36:05
Pretty juicy fees
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:48:59
That was the most useful post I’ve seen so far
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:35:30
Uk, never had this happen
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:52:54
No but can you forward this message to me?
Needs further investigation
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:34:54
This needs to be taken down immediately. This reflects badly on all of us.
And the blood- this isn't what Bitcoin is about
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:45:52
We need to decentralise exchanges
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:38:44
Mine seemed to have moved ok (slowly) with a delay, what fees did you set?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:50:12
Can't you skip words out for acronyms?
I'm not really sure of the acronym rules
