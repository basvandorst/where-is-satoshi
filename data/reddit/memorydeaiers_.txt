I was banned for "ban evasion"  I thought you needed to be banned previously in order to be banned for ban evasion. Weird... 
They're using ban evasion as a blanket term to ban people they don't like.

They banned me without telling me why.  
They claimed it was "ban evasion" and then refused to tell me what other username they believe belongs to me.    
"Ban evasion" is their blanket term to ban whoever they want.

You're literally proving the point of my last comment. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:02:51


Agreed. But what is the ulterior motive this time around?

Why are you judging me over the color of my skin instead of the content of my character? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:04:22


I believe the evidence behind the claim. Never the messenger behind the claim. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:17:24
Exactly. You are essentially judging me by the color of my skin instead of the content of my character.  
Your behavior is that which a racist would do.     
Further, I have never once claimed to be anyone.
