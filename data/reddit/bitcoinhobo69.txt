It's not ready to use yet. They are still in a "reserve your card before it rolls out" spot. 
That said they do look pretty legitimate and interesting. Based in Switzerland, no fees.
Also when you use a referral link like this ( you'll get 10$ USD for free

Not sure if they do pure virtual but it's free so I don't mind the plastic/metal cards.

They aren't affected, but they aren't ready with their cards yet either. They are still in a "reserve your card before it rolls out" spot.

What are the right security measures in regards to segwit2x specifically? I'm not worried about transferring in general.

Yes as I explained in my reply earlier ( ) that would be the idea. But there are bugs in the 2.7.9 version preventing the signing step even with --offline.  It's confirmed by the tails developers (as you could read in the link of my original post) and I've tried it myself.
You probably are on an even older version of Tails/Electrum.
