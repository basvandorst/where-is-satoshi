You would tie up your working capital with a bet that may never be resolved? Ok. I'll take that bet.

There are addresses that coins can be sent to, but not retrieved. This effectively "destroys" the coins. 
u/heldertb, you don't have to compare your holdings to his, and you certainly don't have to let it "bug you."

With the increasing popularity of services like blockcypher, which make on-chain microtransactions easier to manage, we'll probably be seeing more blocks of this nature until we get something more efficient built on top.

People had plenty of advance warning to get out of Paycoin and stay away. Every prominent community member fled, one by one and in droves. The leaked communications should have sealed it for anyone with common sense. Plenty of time to get out from that mess.
Honestly, it might be a good thing. Those that got burned get a great lesson, and crypto overall is better off , once that pig is finally roasted for good.

The community? I hope you aren't referring to hashtalk. Many of us tried to get people out of there, but Josh &amp; Co are active with the ban-hammers. Hashtalk needs to fold up. Nothing good can come out of a place run by GAW.

Well, whale sounds are used by whales for different kinds of communication. The mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of cetaceans to another. Marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins and porpoises, are much more dependent on sound for communication and sensation than are land mammals, because other senses are of limited effectiveness in water. Sight is less effective for marine mammals because of the way particulates in the ocean scatter light. Smell is also limited, as molecules diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. However, *the speed of sound is roughly four times greater in water than in the atmosphere at sea level.* Because sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and cetologists are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased ambient noise in the world's oceans caused by ships, sonar and marine seismic surveys. 
The word "song" is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the humpback whale. This is included with or in comparison with music, and male humpback whales have been described as "inveterate composes" of songs that are striking similar to human musical traditions and music theory. It has been suggested that humpback songs communicate male fitness to female whales. The click sounds made by sperm whales and dolphins are not strictly song, but the clicking sequences have been suggested to be *individualized* rhythmic sequences that communicate the identity of a single whale to *other* whales in its group and allows the groups to *coordinate foraging activities.*
