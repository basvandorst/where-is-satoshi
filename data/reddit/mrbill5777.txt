Is everyone still pumping this gold thing? This crap has been around for thousands of years. It looks cool but what makes it worth anything? I can't take a bar of gold to the store and break a piece off and buy food. Maybe that's why they call bitcoin digital gold? Everything in the world is a ponzi. The more that buy something the higher the value goes up. I would value a garden more then anything in the world because it could feed me for life. Best thing I could do with a gold bar and smash my head in and take my life or somehow mold it in to a butt dildo.  
Same with diamonds. There are enough diamonds in the world for them to give everyone a few of them. They just hold back the supply to keep the price up. One of the biggest scams in history and all those adds that tell the ladies if your man does not buy you diamonds he's a damn loser. Yep, food and water are the most valuable items in the world. Well, toilet paper also, have to wipe after you crap out your food.

It's a trap. We are in a bear market and they just suckered a bunch of people to buy in thinking it's going up. Think we have another month before we could hit the boom. Look how low the volume is getting.

Not if but when the stock market crashes this time it's probably going to send the world in to the next great depression and WW III. It's been highly funded by the federal reserve printing fake money and pumping it up. 2000 big crash. 2008 big crash but this one will be huge. They are doing their final push to get rid of the middle class. 401k all gone. Money gone. I don't think it will be a slow bear market for stocks they will do it quick. 
You have to scratch your head and wonder how major companies that have been around forever are shutting everything down and everyone is out of a job and the market keeps rising. This is not a 6 month thing this happens once a month min. The last big one was Toys R Us . They have a ton of workers that are all losing their jobs, we have in America over 45 million on food stamps out of 360 million people yet the market keeps rising. It's faked.

The bottom is zero. There is always a bottom.
