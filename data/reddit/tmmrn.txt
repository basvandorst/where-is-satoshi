Sure they do, but the problem is still that despite having alternatives that offer freedom they decided for one where the vendor explicitely set up a system where it could completely control what software the user can run (besides "jailbreaking"). And then they are surprised that this vendor actually uses it?

Tor. Encrypt the packages multiple times and each node can only decrypt its "layer". Each node has to prove it relayed the data. So as an attacker you have to own all nodes on the way. Not sure, but maybe there's a way to make someone random node chose the path for you.

Not really a need for bad analogies:
You have one "worker thread" X. A worker thread has its own "working memory" and is running independently in parallel to a lot of other worker processes.
X is tasked to process a sell order of 0.01
X looks up the current balance of the user from the database and puts that value in its own memory.
Meanwhile another speedy worker process Y gets the request to withdraw 100 BTC.
Y looks up the current balance of the user from the database and puts that value in its own memory.
Y processes the withdrawal
Y subtracts the 100 BTC from the user balance in its memory
Y writes the new value from its memory to the balance of the user in the database.
X was very slow in processing the sell order, but finally is ready with processing.
X substracts the 0.01 from the user balance in its memory.
Unfortunately the value in its memory was the old balance before the user withdrew 100 BTC.
X writes the new value from its memory to the balance of the user in the database.
That's the typical "lost update" problem. The solution is to "lock" the account data of the user so that only one of these "worker threads" may work on the same account at the same time and others have to wait.

Hm right, maybe it is problematic for people who use such things as this xposed stuff  that does who knows what to the system...

You and me? I have only a quite small amount of bitcoins but I did not sell them anyway. I am registered at Mt.Gox but I have not done any trade with them. Being from europe I have bought my bitcoins at Bitstamp. (I'm well under what they require verification for).
At Bitstamp the price is currently at $120. Only because of Mt.Gox users? Bitstamp was down yesterday too and I think there was hectic activity too. For some reason...

In europe you can send money to bitstamp with a SEPA transaction with no fee. I think for transactions below 500€ or so you don't need anything else.

Well, I have made two bad decisions so far I think.
The first one: Buying at $230 thinking it maybe it wouldn't crash and just settle somewhere there.
The second one was a few days later when it kept fluctuating between $75 and $100 or so for days. I sold at $95 and placed a buy order at $87. It never went down so far after that...
Yesterday I made a little bit plus, but I still have less than what I started with. The good thing is that I didn't put that much in.
It's mostly random right now. Bitstamp was offline for a short while today. Price dropped from $140 to $125...

I had access to a gigabit connection and the blockchain download was too slow and I didn't feel like wasting all that space, so I googled a bit and Electrum turned up. There are several more "thin clients" that don't need to have the blockchain on the client computer, but electrum seems to be one of the most popular ones.
Basically there are servers that hold the blockchain for you and you only tell them to do your transactions.
If I understood it correctly, you don't need to put much trust in the server, all it can do with malicious intent is to lie to you that it has sent your transaction when in reality it didn't (but you could verify that otherwise), since (if I understood it correctly) the transaction is signed with your private key and the key is not sent to the server.

You can instantly generate as much bitcoin "addresses" as you like.
Now if you buy bitcoins on one of the exchanges and then transfer it to one of your addresses, everyone sees this transaction, but only the exchange knows it is you and the FBI would have to ask them.
You can always create a few more addresses, split your money and send it around a bit and now you can probably reasonably claim that you gave them away for some reason e.g. bought something and it's getting hard to prove you didn't.
Even better is "mining" yourself, meaning you spend a lot of computing power to calculate some cryptographic stuff and "generate" bitcoins. That's basically paying with electricity / hardware costs for bitcoins. Then some random address you created will be the first (or second/third after the pool if you used one) to ever have had this bitcoins and it will be pretty anonymous.
For even better anonymity, tunnel everything through tor so your IP address is not associated with your transaction.

It's one of the basic rules of UI design: destructive actions should have an undo button if possible and/or verification/confirmation. Because if there is a possibility to accidentally click it, some people will.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:41:36


It's probably worth mentioning that you should pick an exchange that is established, trustworthy and is known for handling stuff well. For example mtgox is known to have troubles all the time and taking a looong time to give you your money.
Because all an exchange really is is a bank account and a website: You send dollars to that bank account via debit/credit card/whatever, then they show you your balance in dollar. Then you have a webinterface where you can click "buy bitcoin" or "sell bitcoin" and optionally you can specify for which dollar per bitcoin price you want to buy/sell (if not, then they'll use the current average). Then they search all their users that are currently buying and selling and match them fully automatically with their desired dollar/bitcoin prices. And they'll take a little fee for every time you buy/sell, but it's only like 0.2 or 0.5% so that's much, much less than the bitcoin price fluctuation anyway. And then you can tell them to send your bitcoins to a bitcoin address you own or to send your money to your bank account and if the exchange is trustworthy and not stealing your money and they are not actually bankrupt they'll do that.

Yea, if you keep warning, maybe some sort of crash will eventually happen and you'll have been "correct"...
It isn't even below $800 yet. More people seem to be selling now than a few days before, but unless you can actually see the future I don't believe you can better predict the bitcoin price than I can (hint: I can't. Maybe it will crash, maybe not)

7 hours? Take one hour to read about the basics, download a client that doesn't need the blockchain on your computer like electrum, start it, follow the wizard, wait a few seconds, ready.
And bitstamp in Europe does not need verification for not too big sums and take only few days via SEPA transaction.
