The lesson is too ignore price related discussion on reddit because they shit their pants &amp; declare the sky to be falling at the slightest down tick even if the price is still higher than it was at all in April or May

Then yeah I'd eat the cost and time of the trace while avoiding Campbx until you see what's up.

Small wonder the price is dropping with retarded shit like that being put out, anyone who reads that article and didn't understand what the 51% allowed is probably now under the impression that GHash can just take all their coins.

He's busy posting crap on twitter  looks like he's gonna get away with it in my honest opinion (and I know a lot of you will hate to hear that)

So fork the code then, you're aware that it's open source right?
Fact is he can value his time as he chooses, if he feels his work is worth 50% of every block then he has every right to request that and you have every right to refuse, welcome to the free market kiddo, sorry Big Gov isn't here to force others to work for your benefit.

You could run the trace on the off chance it hasn't been cashed but since you sent it blank I'm afraid you probably are screwed if it has been.

If it's been written as a for hire project with part of the ransoms as compensation or the programmer is having someone else handle the payment side to give themselves some separation then the kill switch makes ripping them off less attractive since you'd get 100% of a smaller pot. I'd assume it was a simple DNS check to see that a domain doesn't exist just to avoid the possible opsec risks of registering it.
