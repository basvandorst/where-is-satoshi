It's still early days and not every coin is usefull for every task. 
Eth is good for contracts, others for fast payments, still others are good for games or whatever. 
BTC is the lion of cryptocurrencies, he's not the fastest nor the cheapest. 
He's simply the king. And because he's the leader he's must not be everyone's darling.

It's like comparing apples and oranges. The Visa system needs buildings and a lot more of infrastructure. 
To keep the system going a lot more of energy is needed all-around the transactions.

What do you really have in your pocket when you own some fiat?
Some paper pieces and the hope that they will be worth next day what's printed on them.
Same with Bitcoin but much more volatile and risky. 
Maybe one day the crypto roller-coaster will go down and then your private keys will be worth almost nothing. Or we see a next all-time high. Exciting!

It's not a question of psychology. It's a question of a possible hardware or software defects.
Sure you may be able to recover your funds with a recovery sheet and a new hardware, but dude that's for sure a hard time until your balance is back on your device.
And not everyone is a specialist for cybersecurity and wants to spend his spare time dealing with ubuntu installations and all that stuff to get a more or less secure environment. 
What I want for crypto is a convenient wallet. Easy, reliable and extremely secure.
As long as that isn't achieved wide adoption is impossible.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:09:37
Bitcoin is more like gold - a saver coin.
Who wants to buy something for 100€ with bitcoin and when the transaction is completed your payment is maybec130€ worth because the price for btc is getting up in the meantime.
Second, transaction fees are too high and transaction time is not fast enough.

Maybe after a massiv worldwide economic crisis or after a global atomic war. So hopefully it will not happen. 
Otherwise they will fight against it. Btc threatens their systems. The system wants to print money as they want. Fiat isn't decentralised but out of control.
@_date: 2019-04-22 07:38:31
I think it's mainly a problem of being to complicated for them to buy or sell coins. The technology is straightforward and the risk to lose all of your money is high if you do one wrong step.
On the other hand If you buy stocks it's much easier and the parties involved are well known and regulated.
So I think it's still a problem of the interface and also trust.

@_date: 2018-11-20 12:37:16
If you mean in terms of charts of e.g. stocks or assets like gold that go up and down, have highs and lows then I see some kind of similarity.
But that is not what you want to imply. 
You want to draw a line between a tulip crises 400 years ago and a high tech product from today. 
Do me a favour and compare things that could be compared. E.g. the internet boom and the blockchain boom.
1993 Bill Gates said the internet is solely a hype and warned to stay away from that thing.
Sure some stocks from then didnt made it, but others are today's big players.

No that's not detrimental.
  
Talking about trivia while other environmental problems are unsolved for decades is what I would call stupid. 
In my opinion these arguments are only used to divert people from real problems out there. 
The blockchain is maybe part of a global solution rather than being an energy problem for our disposable society. 
It's like blaming Tesla for unsolved battery problems when driving with a 3 ton SUV from home to the next store.

Without a trading history how should anyone help you with taxes?
Maybe you have got email or can remember some transactions? Every little information you can find may help you on your way.
I think before you can go to a special tax accountant with crypto experience you first have to do your homework as mentioned above.
But if you couldn't find anything then maybe a lawyer for taxes could help you.

Sorry, but I'm not sure for that. Remember Ethereum they did something what seems to be impossible until that time. They always told us what is written on the chain isn't reverseable but then they looped back. Or am I wrong? So why not scale the volume up for bitcoin if it's "absolutely" necessary? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:39:42
What does hard limit mean. Is it very hard to raise the limit? Or is the limit hard coded on a chip? Seems to me a very short explanation. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:52:39
But what if the bitcoin team decides to raise the possible amount of bitcoins in the future to e.g. 100 million?
If all gold is mined noone could create new but what if there is a decision to raise the total amount of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:55:26
That’s what I think, found this as a good explanation:
We will see first a price waterfall to shake out weak hands, after that the bull will peak.
Till December whales will accumulate BTC and ALTs in dip! So we would not be suprised if BTC re-tested support one more time. 
In December we can expect start bull run (All Market)! - In Q1 2019 we will saw continuation of this Bull Run.

In Wikipedia you can see a gold chart going back around 100 years. There are some significant ups and downs visible.
My opinion to the question wether Bitcoin is a store of value or not: 
Let's wait 5 to 10 years to see what happens to this still very young invention. 
I think there are so many advantages btc has on it's side compared to gold:
(1) You don't have to bite on it to test it
(2) You hold the keys for the vault, not a bank
(3) No fees for the storage
(4) You don't need an axe to pay small amounts 
(5) No need for a bodyguard to carry it with you
(6) You can send it worldwide in minutes 
and so on
The only thing gold does better is the ability to make nice jewellery with it.

In my country there are some things that are already banned, but in an other country maybe next to us it's totally legal. All one has to do is to travel from a to b.
With bitcoin it's much easier, because you don't have to travel physically. Simply open an account in a country were bitcoin are legal. And as long as you live in a free and democratic land there is no problem doing so. 
Were I live there is no great firewall and we don't have to fear to be put in jail without trial.

My simple point is that it could be done. It's not that absolut limit some people always talking about that never ever could be broken. 
Maybe it hard to do so but hard doesn't mean impossible. It's impossible to make gold that is absolutely true. 
I simply don't like to read about this so called advantage of the 21M. It is not true and there are much better arguments for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-19 02:59:16
I think you should read more then just the FAQ. Maybe some books for beginners. 
One thing that should be very clear to you is that you could lose all of your money if the market price goes down. Today the roller-coaster goes up but nobody knows what will happen tomorrow.
Maybe the price will moon but maybe there will be some bad news about the future of bitcoin and then it falls. 
So my advice is, only put money in you are able to lose. It's more a game then a bank account. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 08:38:38
