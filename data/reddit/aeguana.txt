Not too familiar with the US market. There are some great LinkedIn groups for Vending including 'Vending Machines Exchange' which may be able to help.
EDIT: What type of machines were you looking to buy, and for what target products?

Thanks for pointing that out. We've corrected that now.

Actually, I founded a company that has spent the last 24 months working on an intelligent vending machine from the ground up that support crypto payments, in addition to some other cool features :) you can see it at:  
We have some test units out in the UK but unfortunately none of our current clients see the value in Crypto Currency payments yet so they are not enabled!
We have big roll-out plans for the coming months though, and would LOVE to get this adopted everywhere :) I guess if the community makes some noise for it, perceptions will change!

Yes, we considered this. But at that transaction value the operators really don't care about the risk. Consider the risk in fake coins (which is surprisingly prevalent, even in slot machines!) and vandalism to machines to get to the coins, versus crypto payments. It makes it seem very low risk then :)

You'd be surprised how many still do in London!

We don't wait for confirmations. The transaction speed is far more important - people don't want to wait to buy their goods, particularly with some of the goods our clients sell! As I said below, the risk of double spending on this type of product value, versus the risk with fake coins / revoked card transactions etc. is almost negligible.
The way it works is that you add 'credit' to the vending machine with bitcoins. This saves us needing to have different QR codes / addresses for each product, and facilitates multiple purchases. The prices are displayed on all products, so it would be hard to get it wrong!

We are currently working with fairly large vending operators (in the UK), so the pricing revolves around high order volumes (1000+ units), so it's hard to give you a unit price. One of the reasons we spent so long developing and refining the tech was to achieve a highly competitive edge on pricing (i.e. we didn't use off the shelf vending tech which can be extremely expensive!) and make the product viable to a wider market.

Actually the charges on debit cards for vending are quite high, as are the gateway charges for most other transaction types (eg: SMS payments). So as a comparison it is still definitely viable, if not more beneficial (depending on your payment processing gateway) for vending operators to accept bitcoin - all that's needed now is the market!
