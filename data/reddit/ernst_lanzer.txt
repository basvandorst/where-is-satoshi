best post ever
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:17:46
Lame on!
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:12:13
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:32:14
Now you wait till regulations crashes the market.
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:12:56
Thank God. Some sense here.
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:24:05
You still in a bear market mate.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:20:57
Wasn’t today supposed to be the harbinger of good things to come according to “PlanB”? 
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:18:52
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:34:48
Will Roger Ver be one of the final bosses?
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:21:37
Split that €100 in to €10’s and buy during the next 10 weeks/months.
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:31:48
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:11:35
My tears
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:13:31
Double nice
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:06:25
@_date: 2019-08-30 01:18:35
you mean, your deposit got lost like mine after they removed faster payments? I'm still waiting for them to sort it out. Looks like I've lost my money. I need to speak to my bank to see what I can do from here.
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:18:31
Cool, will look into that. Thx!
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:36:22
Err... is this guy talking about volatility?
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:16:36
Cool man! Thx
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:12:25
So, given the current exchange rates (gbp-eur) is it better than card payments?
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:29:03
Good, this will chill out some new hodlers
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:24:09
S2F has been covered by CNBC that means the opposite will happen within the next 18 months.
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:23:40
Just like the 16k Btc meme
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:16:30
I can’t believe this post is for real. This guy is telling people to buy bitcoin in this dip, that is, financial advice and is getting cheered and upvoted. Good luck to you all...
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:27:08
Bad idea. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 11:14:29
Wonderful work mate, not so sure about the message it conveys...
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:23:12
Here's to times of high volatility 
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:31:59
Err.. looks like BCH
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:48:39
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:29:58
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:10:36
If you look at it closer yes. But what over takes the whole thing is the rusty texture. Anyways, an idea in art should be exposed clearly. I believe this is his subject matter, but I just don’t have any background on the creator. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 10:25:25
It’s called bear market. It’s normal to be fearful. What if BTC goes to 1k? Buy more? Smartass.
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:57:09
Same here
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:32:12
Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking. A big red candle is due, maybe 2 or 3 to less than 8.5k. I don’t see btc  going to ath anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-02-27 13:21:22
You... fucked up.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:59:15
Think logarithmically. Don’t get rekt :)
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:24:41
So email is what?
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:49:48
In a rusty (possibly) discarded clock? That’s my only issue. 
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:42:18
If I was a billionaire, I’d just buy btc because everyone’s buying it, just in case it goes to 1million. But it wouldn’t make any difference in my networth, so I’d be sipping a martini on the beach instead :/
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:59:03
Thank you, will try
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:39:46
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:18:31
For the next two years? Wow, such accuracy when BTC reached $20k in two months from $5k (October 2017).
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:54:18
welcome to the club
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:13:38
that's right, wait till it drops without hands too.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:32:04
Of course someone had to fuck it all up
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:34:27
Is it you Charlie?
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:59:13
Thanks, will try ;)
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:16:08
Frankly speaking, this a bit silly and pretentious. Good that you seem to be enjoying it though. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:02:41
Are they accepting GBP?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:47:18
Can't trust crypto either with this volatility.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:08:55
Don’t you guys get tired of posting this shit on every dip? 
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:25:37
Were Ver and the Winklevoss Twins there? 
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:21:47
This was last year. Your average Joe forgot about his bags and sleeps with his gf/wife.
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:45:06
It is.
@_date: 2019-01-03 02:48:03
I do believe you will, I don’t think we’ve reached bottom yet. 2k-2.5k sounds more like a bottom. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:24:28
@_date: 2019-01-20 10:38:57
Nice, proud to be a lowser.
@_date: 2019-09-14 08:30:54
Wtf is this? I want that fucking phone and I can get more satoshis than that like probably most people here. It’s not like we’re talking about life changing money either. You can DCA btc and enjoy a good smart phone on contract. Stop this idiocy please...
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:12:33
Alright. Good for you.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:19:47
Nah, Monero all the way.
@_date: 2019-09-27 09:34:51
Thing is, stocks maybe less volatile but if some of them drop, it will probably be 10 years or more and you don’t even know if the company will go bust. You could wait an eternity and lose it all.how does that fair against 3-4 years of holding Btc? It’s a no brainer.
@_date: 2019-09-11 05:19:54
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:25:10
Of course not, it’s a photo.
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:22:28
you mean flying knee'd
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:36:12
@_date: 2019-09-29 08:17:28
Well said. I don’t get all this hype by this s2f model. Plus check out PlanB’s twitter, it’s full of ‘if’s’ to avoid getting it wrong. He’s done an amazing job predicting btc’s past.
@_date: 2019-09-27 10:52:56
yep, or index funds such as the S&amp;P500
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:39:44
Impressive :)
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:09:06
Lol right in the face... like that knee.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:29:09
What? I thought they were btc and ltc...
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:20:38
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:32:18
maybe cryptocurrency, bitcoin is creating a new breed of oligarchs.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:53:03
You actually read the whole thing? ��
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:05:34
Ok thx!
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:55:48
Completely agreed. This is exactly what Charlie Lee was saying about the last bubble when asked about market manipulation in an interview. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:02:02
Disgusting! 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:34:52
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:18:22
I find these ‘time traveller’ posts as idiotic as the Ripple Riddler videos. Anybody taking these imbeciles as bullish indicators really should pay the price of irresponsible gambling.
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:31:38
there was still Jimmy Barnes left for a build up to $1000000...
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:06:41
Afraid? I don’t think he gives a shit.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:01:50
LOL
