1. What about if I claim an image that I don't own?
2. What if I download, and slightly resize the image? Then the hash will be different? So I'll become an owner of the replica? How a buyer could decide which is which?
3. What if I apply some filters on a well known and already claimed picture and later claim "the new masterpiece" -- the hash again will be different and the problem from 2. arises again?

This is not true. The amount of BTC/RUB trades is just the same, but the rate of RUB/USD grows up. If you plot RUB/USD charts on top of BTC/RUB you'll see that it correlates. Here we done it fot LocalBitcoin rates 
The blue line is RUB/USD.

Actually ammount of BTC/RUB on LocalBitcoins is growing, but if you plot a RUR/USD rate on top of the charts you will see that it doesn't in terms of USD: 
That only means that Russians still not aware about Bitcoin and soon even Bitcoin-related Internet resources will be banned by authorities.
