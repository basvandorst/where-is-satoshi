Just what I was looking for.  Everyone is talking about lightning but no one links to the code!  I could never guess to look at "ElementsProject"
But something I don't understand is how a bitcoin node fits in with that.  The page you linked to doesn't say anything about bitcoin.  Don't the two work together?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:06:41
So you don't know.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:25:06
I know that the link says it.  I meant that your answer didn't.  I didn't mean to be unclear about that.  But thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:49:07
Yes.  And do you have an answer to my question?
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:16:42
In what country do 5 year olds know algebra?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:59:44
I'm looking that up now.  But can you give me a quick synopsis of bench32 format?  Do I want this? 
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:22:24
This makes total sense, except the time travel part.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:10:41
Another question is: is a bech32 address a Bitcoin Cash address?  I just did a search and Bitcoin Cash came up as connected to bech32.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:08:56
What about shapeshift?  If you created a wallet with electrum, could you send and receive from shapeshift using the bech32 address?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:15:13
Oh that helps.  bench32 came up empty.  But even bech32 doesn't tell my much.  Like if you have bech32 with electrum then can you send and receive from mycelium?  shapeshift?  coinomi? etc?
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:58:19

Cash is harder to verify than BTC.  Do you and the buyer both have firearms and guys coming to the meeting?

Bonus, there's no risk of looking like there's money laundering going on.

@_date: 2017-04-12 04:50:37
Oh man.  This was the problem.  I thought that the "bind" line was referring to the RPC, so I had it set to 127.0.0.1.  I changed that to the public IP and I now have 14 connections.
Thank you to you and to everyone who posted replies.
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:46:52
EDIT: you just want the output?

EDIT: and of course 8 of these:

@_date: 2017-04-01 23:34:47
Please explain what you mean.  Specifically, who would be changing the rules in such a compromise and how does that differ from who can change the rules now?
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:55:03
Right but :
1) What does that have to do with signaling?
2) What does that have to do with port forwarding (as opposed to just opening a port?)
Also: 
3) Which port are we talking about?
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:15:55
I just don't see how it relates.  I really think uPNP is only for machines behind a router, not VPSes.  Maybe I'm wrong, though.  
Anyway, I tried with the firewall disabled and same problem.
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:03:51
It is saying that it is closed.  But the port is open.  I don't know what that site is doing running as a test but nc disagrees with it.  Maybe it uses nmap?  But nmap says "closed" when a port is open if nothing is listening on it.  That is what I think is happening.  But I'm not sure how to test/debug.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:06:17


Now that I know what you're talking about I don't want to be obnoxious but you asked so I will answer.  "Port forwarding" refers to forwarding the port of one computer (or router) to a port on another computer.
In its simplest form, you would forward port 8333 on the router to port 8333 on the computer.  But you could just as easily forward port 8333 to port 22.
This is useful when you're behind a router and not on the public internet.
But even if you do that, you still have to *open* the port.  You would do this with something like this on your computer:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8333 -j ACCEPT
The first one is port forwarding, from one machine to another, useful for NATted machines.  The second is necessary regardless.
Anyway, it all makes sense now so thank you for answering.
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:48:22


Yes.  EDIT: I *think* so.


I don't know.  What does this mean and how can I test?


This is a new word for me.  Can you explain briefly?
@_date: 2017-04-11 10:08:54


I'm not sure what upnp is.  This is a VPS.  Does that make a difference?  (I remember something about UPNP on routers.  Is that what you're talking about?)


That's for the RPC server.  I think this is a completely different issue.
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:34:55


Yes I have done.  Their TOR specifically allows running a BTC node and they have specifically said just now that they are not blocking ports.  Obviously I have to trust them on this.
EDIT:  Their TOS says:
you are allowed to run bitcoind, litecoind, *coind on your VPS's for your websites or your online applications or personal use and/or commercial use
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:01:13
You lost me.  I saw the node checker.  It told me that the node was unreachable.  But we knew that already.  The question is why and what to do about it?  Port 8333 is open (and doesn't it have to be, since I have 8 active connections?)
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:30:34


Yes.  Do you have a better suggestion?
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:15:46


Great.  But "Can you give a quick overview of how this differs from the standard bitcoinorg package? I assume it is more than just the comment/flag?"
Or do you not know?  It's okay if you don't.  I asked the same question of the maintainer. I just figured that if you're posting instructions about it, you'd answered this question for yourself first?
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:18:45
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:35:46
Why would a port forward be necessary for this?  (Beyond whatever you already need to reach the public internet?)
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:22:40


I have done.  They confirm that 8333 is not blocked.




Yes I know.  That is why I want to fix it. :)
Is this the correct 8333-related output for netstat -natup:
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:8333 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN
EDIT: I tried completely flushing IPTables in the beginning and it did not help this problem.

Not for me, but thanks for the suggestion.  I don't want a server in my home.
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:37:08


It's probably this.  Perhaps there is a config option or a flag I need to use.  Where would I research this do you think?  (Searching now....)

Hey do you have a second to help me with a similar problem again?  
I am running a zcash server (which is almost exactly like bitcoind) and I have only 8 connections.  However, I CAN connect manually via telnet, and then I show 9 connections.
Can you think of anything that *would* allow telnet but would *not* allow other peer connections?
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:13:00
Okay, but I'm not looking for a link to a binary.  I'm looking for a Howto.  Slack creeps me out.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:44:39
Yes, it's a great guide for signaling.  But that's not what I'm asking.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:03:36
Thank you for your attempt but those instructions are for how to *signal* SegWit, not how to be actually compliant.
But yes, I am looking for something like this, but to the end of having a BIP-148 node.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:45:11
Did you happen to read the part of my post where I said "I'm not looking for another dickhead to post a link to the github page or something else that I've obviously tried already."
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:30:45
I'm going to downvote not because I don't think you're entitled to your opinion but because what you're saying isn't related to my OP.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:31:24
Ohhhh.... Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:16:56
That isn't helpful.  What you sent me is a link to *very* poorly written instructions for compiling that code from source.  Even if it was adequately written instructions for compiling that code from source, that still isn't a Howto get BIP-148 running.
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:02:13
Thank you but you're misunderstanding my question.  I have already compiled it.  That's no problem.
Now what am I supposed to do with it?  Getting software is only useful when there are instructions for how to install and use it. :)
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:44:12
Yes I know.  I was pretty clear about that in my post.  I said "I'm not looking for another dickhead to post a link to the github page or something else that I've obviously tried already."
What I am asking for is a HowTo guide, so that I will know what to do with the source code (or binaries) once I have it.
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:18:36
(Also, those instructions for compiling don't work.  You obviously didn't try them before posting.  Again: you're a dick.)
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:56:10


Yes, I know how git works.  But that's not what's at issue here.  You're just being defensive.  Whatever.  Like I said: it all worked out, and your notes did help.  Even though you're a dickhead, and can't admit when you do something halfway.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:55:31


That command throws an error.  But I finally figured it out.  You did help in the end.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:13:50
Yeah great BTC moon.  But WTF is that thing in the picture?
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:15:13


Yep.  That's exactly what my post says.  Well, figuratively.  If you didn't feel like holding hands, why did you reply?  Oh yeah: because you're a dick.
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:22:13




Really?  That seems odd because a thorough search did not.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:10:53
I don't see how that would work.  I think the minimum you would need is at least a camera (to view QR codes) and a display (to display QR codes.)
But I've never spent any BTC so I really don't know if I'm right.  I've never seen a store where you can spend it.  What kind of terminal do places like that have?
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:15:44


No.  Do you know why?  Because that other link didn't have a step by step guide to installing BIP-148, and that's what I asked for in my post.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:42:22
Huh?  Totally off-topic.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:44:25
I worked it out.  Your info did help a lot.  It was still confusing but I got it done.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:39:25
Exactly.  And I am asking how to do that if I decide on this route.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:55:25

@_date: 2017-06-28 12:06:49
Again, no it wasn't.  I had to get it from the other repo.  
Why is it so hard for you to swallow that your instructions were incomplete?
EDIT: Oh shit.  Maybe I'm confusing you with someone else who "helped."  So many people sending me half answers, it's hard to tell.  If I'm confusing you with someone else then I am sorry.  Maybe you're not a total dickhead?
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:46:59


HOW?!?  Steps, please.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:52:38
I'm familiar with the github.  I don't see a HowTo anywhere on it though, nor does it answer the other questions.  That's exactly why I'm writing this post. :)  
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:37:05
Yes, dickhead.  That's where I finally had to copy it from.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:22:29
Yes I did and no I'm not.
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:07:40
Thank you very much... but now I'm really confused.  I already have bitcoind running elsewhere on the system.  Are you saying that I'm supposed to run this in addition?  Or do I completely uninstall the other one?
I really would like a step by step if you know of one.
EDIT: Also using those instructions, I don't end up with a binary.  I get "No rule to make target 'install'. Stop"  But I compile shit all the time, so it's not as though Im new to it.  Are you sure those instructions are correct and complete? If not, I can certainly figure it out but I assume you wouldn't have written it if you weren't sure.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:57:12
Great.  Can anyone please provide step by step instructions for installing UASF (BIP-148) on an existing core node?  I know where to find the software, so don't need some dick pasting a link and feeling like he has helped.  I would like instructions please.
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:18:28
Hey asshole, I already complied it before I posted.  My question wasn't about how to get the binary.  What I was asking for is a HowTo for installing it, which you would know if you read the post.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:44:55
Maybe a better thing for me to ask is: *EXACTLY* what did you do?  Please explain specifically and fully.  You didn't read something and magic happened.  You did things.  My question is: what exactly are those things?
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:19:07
Off topic.  My post is specifically asking for a step by step guide.  If you just want to post a link like a dick and feel like you've done something, this is the wrong thread.

What is all this shit about a Raspberri Pi?
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:18:41


Since I don't know how to install, I can't tell you what's missing.  That's why I'm looking for a Howto.  And that isn't a manual.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:22:42
Now you're just being a dick.
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:05:38


If you're interested, the error is:
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
That's why I don't think you were really typing the correct thing at the correct place there.
And then if you check out within the bitcoin directory (which you didn't specify), then what?  Typing "make" doesn't help.
This is why I was asking for step by step instructions.
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:23:29


And you're a lazy dickhead.


Nope.  Maybe actually try things before you post them?
