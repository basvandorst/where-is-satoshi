So what's your business plan? How will you make money? Can I take a guess? Providing off-chain solution and consultancy to businesses?
And when the majority of code is written by Blockstream employees (volume-wise), and Blockstream employees including Adam Back control the narrative and sign exclusivity agreements with miners behind closed doors, we have no choice but to "trust Blockstream".

How about the obvious reason: increased price has people buying Bitcoin like crazy and causes increased demand / transactions. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:29:08
So that means you effectivly couldn't opt out, cause you are still on the same chain. Which gives miners total control. Imagine miners soft-fork a block size decrease to 1/10th of the current size, so they can collect more fees (possible with a softfork). You would sit there nicely with your previous version.. Equally crippled like the new version cause that soft fork applies to you too.

Michael did certainly not have any authority to speak for the Classic project, and does not represent it in any way. The fact that he was involved early on does not change that. He assisted us in setting up consider.it, and thats it. He obviously went overboard in claiming auhority over anything. Our stance has been from the beginning that the only focus is 2MB now and governance can be decided on later. Having 2MB happen will help enable open competition between different clients, which is much more important.
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:17:33
Nodes and miners used to be the same thing. I'd actually prefer to get rid of the "everyone should be able to run a node", and switch to "everyone should be able to be a miner". I'm sure you can agree to that, as that is of course the ideal scenario. Under that scenario, where everyone has a little asic running at home, it would give them voting rights and income. 
I'm writing an article on on-chain scaling and what the true capacity of the network is. We can discuss more after.

PR's that do substantial changes need to be debated first on the proper forums. Keeping this open gives the wrong signal, and we would be debating "Classic is going to change to 80% omg!" now. Instead of just posting the screenshot with me closing the PR, you could have included my comment slightly below which said exactly that ;)
By the way: I guess changed its policy from NOT allowing other clients to be discussed to now allowing only NEGATIVE news about other clients? Progress!

He has some very good remarks and you answered selectively. Miners are already running in datacenters and are defacto centralized. Thats a much bigger issue than running a node on your home network. Why not talk about miners instead? Solving node decentralization is fairly easy, and will probably be done in the next year or so.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:31:50
Its not enough to offset it short term. We will require more on-chain transactions for that. It should get there in the next years though. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 01:11:10
You forgot that the difficulty (and price of mining) is actually much higher today. So no, today, mining is not profitable below ~$300 for most miners.

15:43 “Much has been made over the past few days about the failure of Bitcoin and a rift in the ecosystem which is manifested from a post by an influential Bitcoin developer leaving the community. In particular he’s highlighted some technical issues with a lack of resolution. Technical issues such as increasing the block size. What has NOT been well report, is how the ecosystem responded. Within 96 hours of the initial post, the majority of the large bitcoin transaction processors in the world, agreed to a “hard fork” for increasing the block size."
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:16:25
Number one reason: Miner fees vanishing, which in return lead to less miners and Bitcoin being less secure.. Undermining the whole system. 
Also, being forced into (potentially centralized), so far unproven, sidechain solutions. And why? We can make bitcoin scale on-chain without risking more centralization. Many proposals for that. You just have to be willing to look. But yeah, miner fees are the biggest risk right now.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:26:34
You are right. And miners can decide the minimim fee they process a transaction for. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:20:29
Classic has no intention to become the new reference client. It wants to enable free competition. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:38:00
The feasible way would be to increase the block size limit again, as it would be extremely expensive to spam attack it. Historically, until 1 year ago, this has worked perfectly as blocks were never full. Right now attacking Bitcoin is trivial, cause it's really cheap to generate a transaction backlog.
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:25:11
Sure they can, but thats not the point of my argument. What if they softfork to segwit with a 10gb size for example?
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:36:32
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:12:34
1) I'm talking in the context of SPV nodes that will be more capable than today.
2) If they kill all miners, it's over anyway. Miners running the full nodes was the intent of Bitcoin after it was bootstrapped successfully.
You will get MUCH more decentralization from millions running proper SPV nodes than trying to have everyone in their home run a full node.
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:36:44
Luke I have a question. If you want most transactions done on sidechains instead of on-chain, you'd have to make sure that miners are still earning fees. Wouldn't it be better to make the block size like 10kb or even less? That way you'd have to pay $1000 or more to get your transaction included. Either you go no limits, and make make more fees by high volume, or you go to very low limits, so every on-chain transaction costs a ton of money. Inbetweens wont work long term. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:28:51
I sincerely hope you are trolling :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:26:38
With a permanent block size solution that keeps the block size limit above market demand, I'm open to it. As long as they happen both at once (or Segwit later).
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:00:55
That's the tradeoff and decision miners have to make, and your question was just answered above. If they do something absolutely retarded like changing the 21 mil supply, they might end up with a very small amount of users or a very low market cap, which will in return diminish their hash rate cause they can't afford it anymore. The battle for the name "Bitcoin" will always be a PR thing. But in this case, there's no way I feel that Peter Todd has any reason to claim the original Bitcoin and diminish Unlimited to BTU. Quite the opposite actually. In the end, there's no contract that can be fought (except in case of the ETF, which in my opinion does set a standard to what the Bitcoin name will be). But if Bitcoin Core's small block policy would have won, I would not have tried to claim the name Bitcoin in a minority fork, but would have gone with Bitcoin Classic for example. Anyway, it's up to Peter now or whoever wants to keep the minority fork going to come up with a clever name. I don't think my suggestion was that bad TBH and BTCC (the company) might actually support it cause it could be a good business decision to get their own coin. Both them and Bitfury seemed to be the only real dedicated Core supporters anyway. They can combine their mining forces and try to make some money.  I won't be betting the farm on them though.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:03:10
You can say the same thing about miners.

I'm open to discuss fraud proofs, and it's good to hear you'd be more open to considering moving full nodes to datacenters in that case. Very interesting discussion. And yes, I'd be a fan of running sufficient archival nodes outside of just the miners (I've always mentioned that in the past, that this was a must).
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:16:11
I hope one day we can have a proper debate on why you think it would be an issue. I never really see you do any debates or interviews.

@_date: 2016-03-17 17:43:53
It's not like you gave them a choice. Also, I cannot understand why you think it's great news that people have to pay more fees during certain times of the day.  
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:22:44
I'm all for giving SPV nodes more scrutinizing power (within certain limits). It's a much better solution than fucking with the block size. Leave that up to the miners, including running full nodes. It will make the network so much better (it's intended to be like this by original design).
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:48:42
This wasn't ready for publication.. just a brainstorm I was writing down on Medium. Haven't discussed this with anyone. Good to see the reactions it would create though :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:31:05


Block size is not a job for SPV nodes to scrutinize, as they are unaffected by the block size, that's the whole point. So no, I would say that's pretty much the most stupid fraud proof you could submit, as it's irrelevant (and will hinder network growth). 
@_date: 2016-01-31 12:41:47
So why do many, potentially far more damaging changes such as RBF get pushed through without 95% consensus? They are much more contentious than a 2MB HF. The only way you can avoid them is by not upgrading to the latest version of Bitcoin Core. And that's exactly why Bitcoin Classic came to be. Also, your logic of miners doing something evil is flawed. A 2MB size increase is what almost everyone wants. The only reason why its causing distress is because it hasnt been approved by Core. The moment they would say "OK", this whole debate goes away. While the reality is that Bitcoin is ran by miners and the economic majority, not by Core. And both of those groups overwhelmingly want 2MB, through a simple change which should have happened 3 years ago. Core can continue to ignore that, while they alienate everyone in the process.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:01:21
So I guess Wladimir is also a bad maintainer? 
Try submitting a controversial PR to Core without discussing it first and see how long it stays open. There are appropriate discussion channels set up for a reason. That's actually a good thing, because it makes it easier for everyone to follow the debate instead of having to look at 5 different places.

@_date: 2017-03-07 11:53:12
Sorry Peter, but the original Bitcoin will be the one that's going to get the majority hashrate behind it in a fork. It doesn't matter if they would run a software called Unlimited or Core or Classic. You will be the minority fork and become the altcoin, that's the way the game is played and you know it. With any fork, the majority keeps the spoils. Otherwise we would be running an altcoin today since Bitcoin already forked in the past. Hope you can find a good name, but BTC is already taken. Maybe you can make a deal with BTCC and call it Bitcoin Core, I'm sure Samson won't object (although he left BTCC). This way you can also get the .com domain.
The ETF just confirms this. Although I'd think it would be wise to not just destroy the altcoins they will keep in the minority altchain. They should add them to the ETF so it has a combined value.
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:57:43
With a hard fork, not upgrading means you will effectively stay on the old chain. If enough people stay behind and "say no", it stays alive. With a softfork you are 100% screwed as a non-miner cause you cannot effectively say no. Soft forks give miners total control and make non-mining nodes into voteless, voiceless dumb terminals.
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:00:45
I think the easiest thing to do is to list all of the concerns an SPV node might have, and then see what fraud proof would be possible. Some of those concerns would have political effects (like block size), and I think it would be best to initially focus on the ones that everyone can agree on (small and big block camp).
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:25:58
That's a lot of IF's. If Ethereum (original) dies off cause Ethereum Classic gets all mining power behind it, then they may or may not keep the Ethereum Classic name. Like I said in my reply, it's all PR and community driven decisions. Actually, thats the reason why I'm making an issue about it, cause these are the places where things get decided. We are the community and we are debating it now. We all influence each other. And I don't think Peter has a claim on Bitcoin, or that Unlimited should start using BTU. That's just ridiculous and I think in this case, Majority hash power should keep BTC and minority needs to rename.

Even IF there would be a need to settle onchain (which will be increasingly less), it wouldn’t even begin to compare to having billions of onchain transactions per day. I highly doubt Lightning settlements will be sufficient whatsoever to keep security sufficient.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:13:07
My point still remains that people (well, mostly the software companies) will change their SPV client if something really corrupt happens. Same for exchanges and online wallet providers. Having everyone run a full node cripples Bitcoin and that tradeoff is not worh it to prevent something which is incredibly unlikely to happen to begin with: miners destroying their own investment by performing fraud. In any case, there will always be sufficienty honest places to connect your SPV client to.
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:38:49
Bitcoin would be fine without non-mining full nodes. You can’t say the same about hash power though.

My original intent of joining that conversation was to ask peoples opinion and arguments about full nodes, because I'm writing an article about that. The way I operate is to have an open mind, get fully informed, get all angles and viewpoints and draw a conclusion. The problem is that people are so negative and agressive nowadays that they see question asking or an open mind as a weakness. Its very unfortunate that it came to that. The fact that me ignoring bait from someone asking me about the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork, making you conclude that I don't know the answer, says a lot :) I know more than you think, but its not so easy to communicate with a group of rabid dogs trying to tear you to shreads, especially when you are there to ask questions and get informed. Feel free to read my article about fees, where I did do several weeks of research. So far noone as written a proper reply to debunk it (2 people have tried). 
In conclusion: I think the main reason why the community is in dissaray is because of the unwillingness to have open debates. A combination of "only presentations allowed, no controversy" scaling conferences (pindar), combined with ongoing reddit censorship, dev mailing list censorship, and secret miner meetings with hush hush "sign my contract so you stay loyal to MY code", is a recipe for disaster. Why do you think Adam Back and mostly Blockstream employees rushed to China to get them to sign a contract, right after it looked like Classics 2MB increase got support from almost every Bitcoin Company and miner out there? People who are secure in their positions and knowledge don't need monopoly contracts nor censorship. Stuff to think about.
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:56:45
You do realize high fees forced people on centralized platforms like Coinbase, right? High fees could have been prevented by raising the blocksize just slightly, in a way that didn’t affect decentralization. And ideally everyone should store their Bitcoins directly with SPV clients (no, almost no end user is gonna run a full node and neither should they). SPV clients are a million times better than Coinbase, but you need a bigger blocksize for that.

- Do you deny that you are against a block size increase? You are, you even want to lower the block size so fees would get even higher.
- Do you deny altering Bitcoin by signing an exclusivity agreement with the miners in Hong Kong with false promises that there would be hard fork code by July 2016? This exclusivity agreement resulting in Bitcoin no longer being able to upgrade its block size and forcing us into your "fee market" for half a year now because of artificial space constraints?

"a product of years of hard work which none parties working on classic have contributed to.".
Gregory, both Gavin and Jeff have contributed tremendously to Bitcoin over the last years. On top of that, any work that has gone into Classic, was also made available / submitted to Core. Also, your "us vs them" mentality is only coming from your end. We are more than happy to cooperate and share code. I'm actually not sure why you are insulted? Because people chose to follow their own path, instead of blindly adopting Core? That's actually a good thing. It means decentralization works.

“If we lived in a perfect world, where all developers agree on the direction Bitcoin should take, then a hard fork would be better, because it would be cleaner,” he said. “However, after all the controversy we had, and the various attempts to impose a hard fork against the will of Bitcoin Core developers, I believe a soft fork is preferable. Not for technical reasons, but for political reasons.”
So we need to choose a technically inferior solution for political reasons and because it goes against the will of the Core developers.. sounds about right..

The story is a little bit more complicated than that. Mark always used the excuse of banking problems. He implicitely promised me I would be able to sell my 5 mil worth of btc and get my money. After I sent them to him and converted into USD, it was suddenly no longer possible. My lawyer told me to freeze his bank accounts, but I said no cause I didn’t want to bring Mtgox down (I know it would have). This is all provable with emails. So I actually put the community above my own (5 mil) interest at that point, because 1 week later mtgox went belly up anyway and if I would have filed my claim and frozen his accounts the week before that, I would have been before any other creditor and would have recovered my 5 mil much easier. After that I converted back to btc and exited at 20% of original value through bitcoinbuilder. And yes, I originally claimed the difference between those amounts cause I felt Mark was responsible for making false promises and luring me in, but later I realized that this money would come from other creditors so I didnt press my claim after it was rejected. I still fully intend to sue Mark personally to recover my money, but at least it won’t be coming from anyone else. It’s a tricky call to make in this situation, it’s not as black and white as you think.

It's slightly more complicated than that. I had a 5 million dollar claim on mtgox and had the possibility to freeze their bank account to block my money. My lawyer strongly adviced me to do it, but I knew it would have been the end of mtgox so I said no, Bitcoin is more important. Unfortunately Mark screwed me over and they went bankrupt a week later (timeframe might differ slightly). I have multiple sources that can confirm it. And yes, of course I tried to get my 5 million back in that claim. I was only able to recover some of it partially through Bitcoinbuilder. I substracted the amount I was able to recover through Bitcoinbuilder from my claim, so please don't make any false statements.
