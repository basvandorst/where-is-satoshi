Hate to break it to you, but the prompt "experiencing high application volume" has always been the automated/standard message since Gemini opened

That's a weak ass argument. And you're missing the point.

Have no idea why this sub is so butthurt over the price increase in Bitcoin Cash/BCH.. Bitcoin/BTC went from less than a $1000 to $8000 this year..
What goes up must come down. Bitcoin will be fine.

Not an exaggerated amount by any means. Especially if you've been around since the early days.

$50 is a lot.. It would be cheaper to wire it via a bank at that point. I mean, have you ever traveled or lived in a third-world country? Have some perspective.
Been in the space for close to 6 years (throwaway account) and clearly remember a time when $100,000+ could be sent for less than $.50
Those are straight facts.

Huh? Dangers? C'mon, at least make some sense

Uh.. do you not control your own private keys?

Returning the Bitcoin is a part of the plea:

We will have to wait and see. Have spoken with the liquidators that are in charge of Ryan's assets (has claimed bankruptcy, but has yes to surrender) and they have done a phenomenal job of handling the case.
They are paid only if they are successful in recovering creditors funds in addition to keeping the costs to a minimum. Know that Google is in control of the Mintpal (V2) server. 
Liquidators have also noted that if/once the BCC charges Ryan guilty they will carry out a full analysis. Of course, this is only if "funds become available to non-preferential creditors". Based off of available "information provided", his assets include IT equipment, motor vehicles, and "uncounted cash".
Hope this helps you guys or other lurkers!
