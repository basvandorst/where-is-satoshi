They demand you give it to them, and they start taking away things that they can take by force until you do.

Lets say 10 Bitcoins exchange for $10,000 which is exactly enough to buy a Ford F150 pickup truck. 
But then due to inflation, the purchasing power of the US dollar is cut in half, but the Bitcoin exchange rate stays the same.
You now still have 10 Bitcoins that exchange for $10,000 but it's now only enough to buy half the truck.
US dollar inflation = Bitcoin inflation.
Prices in US dollars rise 2% every year, and since you have to convert to US dollars to purchase items, there's no difference. Bitcoin's price is just so volatile that it's hard to see it.

So it's expected that the volatility will go down over time?
And what makes it unconfiscatable? Countries can create what ever rules they want, so if even if it can't be taken now, what stops them in the future?

I'm not saying that Bit Coin isn't something "valid". I'm asking how it's a currency instead of a stock. You invest in stock, like those billionaires.

Either in physical currency or in a bank

In the US, $250,000 is guaranteed by the FDIC per bank, per kind of account you have. That's good enough for 99% of the population.

Thank you, I'll check him out

I might just be really out of touch, but a bank charging you $10 a month to hold onto your money seems crazy, even for not meeting their minimum amount. You are loaning your money to them to use, and they are charging you for it? Maybe it's different in your country. 
So all of the money that you have fluctuates with the price of Bit Coin? So when the price fell 65% from December, all of your money took that hit? I guess if you've living pay check to pay check, it might not matter that much. But even then, if you cash your paycheck into Bit Coin when the price is high, and then it takes a hit, that could be ruff.

I apologize for insulting your precious currency.

But it seems like the vast, vast majority of Bit Coins are used as a high risk investment, instead of paying for meals or filling up the tank. People sell their Bitcoins because they are either cashing out or think the price will drop.

The number of dollars increasing isn't the primary cause of inflation.
The primary cause of inflation is in the rate that money circulates. When the economy booms, inflation increases not because the number of dollars increases but because companies pay their employee's higher wages and raise prices to pay for it.
Inflation is about the availability of money, which can be increased through actual creation of new bills, or through increased monetary circulation.

What matters is your **purchasing power**, the amount of goods and services you can buy, which does fluctuate with the exchange rate of Bitcoin. The number of Bitcoins you have doesn't matter. The amount of stuff you can buy with them does matter, and that can rise or fall by 30% in ONE DAY. 
If you had $10,000 worth of Bitcoins on December 17th, on Feb 5th you had only $4,500 left without spending anything. It wasn't like the exchange rate in December was a really good sale that you just didn't take advantage of, you lost $6,500. Poof, gone. That's $6,500 dollars you would have had if you cashed out of Bitcoin instead of holding onto it. The amount you are worth changes with the exchange rate of Bitcoin. 
I'm genuinely concerned that you misunderstand this when you are putting all of your money into Bitcoin. All of your savings are in an extremely risky investment.

It's a fantastic return, but it's only a good investment decision if it made sense at the time of making the decision. 
Would you consider buying $10,000 worth of lottery tickets a good investment? No. 
What if those tickets won you $10 million? Still no.

I'm not necessarily talking about government corruption. I was thinking about a circumstance where someone steals lots of money and then hides it in Bitcoin. 
It's like a 7 year old stealing someones sandwich, quickly devouring it and then saying "Ha, it's gone and there's nothing you can do about it!".  If they want to punish you, they can find a way. 
I can see how it is something that, even if they took everything you own and put you in prison, its an asset that you could still hold onto and use if you ever got out. But at that point, you've already lost and your Bitcoin holdings would just be something that makes your future a little less bleak.
