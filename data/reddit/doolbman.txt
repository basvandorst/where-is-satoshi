How would you user credit or debit card? Who would accept a check? So in that situation, unless you have gold bars under your bed, you would be screwed no matter what currency you are using.

DropBit wallet was designed for just this. It’s just like BRD but you can send to friends using their phone number. It is non custodial, so no kyc or anything.

Confirmations are not dependent on wallet, the transaction is either on the chain or not. Confirmations are based on fees. So maybe ledger puts low fees but you should still see the transaction on a block explorer like coinninja

All spv wallets connects to full nodes by default. If you are talking about lighting then there is wallets like zap that connect to full nodes with qr codes.

I have see a lot of post in here about this lately, people asking us to help them get their “found” bitcoin out.

Actually it will be less because you will be combining all you inputs into 1

if people like him don't spend the bitcoin, it will never circulate in the economy, be used as a currency by other people, go up in price. He is helping keep bitcoin price down and hurting his own cause.

Is because one has a balance and one does. The one with the balance it adding up up all you inputs and that makes the estimated transaction bigger and thus more expensive fees.

Segwit is not a different chain just a different type of address, but yes segwit addresses are better and you should transfer to them.

It looks like localbitcoins doesn’t support sending to segwit addresses (one that start with bc1) you can create a new electrum wallet that has partial segwit addresses (one that start with a 3) look for bip 49 when creating the wallet. Or you could send to another wallet like DropBit
