Not sure if you are serious...

I have consulted with other members and this seems to be part of a larger problem.

That's actually good input, point was made here before.
All in all this seems to me more of a legal than a bitcoin topic. It's depending on the jurisdiction, risk appetite and tolerance of the merchant I guess.
I gave the Kraken example, if I'm not mistaken they allow $1k daily limits by just submitting the physical address without any documentation.

How do you know actually?

Thank you!

I told them I'm considering it, then they threatened me legally

The paragraph in their TOS is probably rather to protect themselves from users that made losses while playing and then just charge back. It's not worth for me to find out ;)

not sure either, maybe that part where you said that credit card theft isn't a problem

To be honest, I don't even know if poker sites have a money laundering problem. At least with deposits in that range. That was an assertion made by BitcoinCE0, and since I don't even know if this is correct I cannot defend or attack it. I would appreciate if somebody who knows more about this could shed some light into this. If I recall correctly, e.g. Kraken allows deposits/withdrawals in a higher range without any documents. So this might again depend on the jurisdiction and company, same like the age problem?
Regarding the CC number, you are taking what I said completely out of context.
Of course I'm not worried that they steal the $100, that's not the point. And I'm aware that a bitcoin casino could steal my deposits as well (I lost a lot of money with Gox).
Obviously it's about the details that I gave them and that it's possible to make further charges on a CC. Remember the Target leak?
I probably gave them enough details to take a mortgage in my name ;)
Regarding my deposit, I feel that this is even less constructive than the CC remarks. I don't really feel that this any of your business but eventually I planned to deposit more than $600 and anyway there are enough people that would. What is your point?

just fuck off already, don't you get it?

From a technical point of view, Bitcoin could avoid all of those problems and guarantee 0% fraud.
In fact I tried out Seals with Clubs. It's Bitcoin Poker for Mac/Pc/Linux.
They didn't ask for any verification of that sort, if I recall correctly they didn't even ask for my first name.
Now, there might be a legal point of view as well, probably depending on the Jurisdiction. 
I'm not a lawyer and not competent to discuss this. I'm not sure if ticking a box "yes I'm 21+" would suffice, but I've heard controversies about age verifications for porn sites as it's never possible to guarantee the age of the user anyway.
