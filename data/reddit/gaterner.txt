How about I give you .1 bitcoin and you let it grow till it can pay off those loans?

I heard this story at 100, 1000, 5000, and now 6000. Keep preaching brotha, hope the realization that you sold millions for thousands doesn't bite you to hard at the end! And FYI I do use it, I just replace whatever I buy with it as soon as I do including a future me tax for accessing his retirement funds.

Hope you paying your capital gains taxes. It's 25% everytime you take you buys out, even if you put them back in eventually you still of uncle sam the 25%
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:22:07
Your doing it wrong. See you should've bought 500 coins in 2012 like me. Sold 10% at 1000 dollars, 10% at 10 thousand, 10% at 20 thousand and so forth. Next 10 percent is at 50k, 100k, 1 million, and 10 million. This way you never deplete your stash while still making stupid ROI.

Yet your here just to watch from the sidelines so you can laugh at them when they lose their money. The funniest thing is they will be the same people you will be approaching in 10 years asking for loans. Karma is a funny lady.

You lucky son of a bitch! Can I marry you so I can migrate to you country? I'll pay you one bitcoin for it?
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:16:02
how long the sucky suck? And can I unload in your orafice? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:19:35
Nope! I bought yesterday and am buying again later this week on payday! I'll be buying till I retire dammit! And even then when I retire, I won't sell, no, by then the world will have evolved to the point where I can use it.

It will go back up don't worry :) Next time never buy at a high though, always wait for the dips then go in! Makes it more fun because then you only ever see growth instead of a loss for a couple of weeks. Buying at a high is what scared my boss when he got a whole coin for 2.5k, dropped to 1.6k so he pulled out before it blasted to 5k, so now he only has half a bitcoin because he went back in at double the value. Never pull out though, you never know when the next jump is and from my experience I have seen many friends pull out just before the next jump and miss out on thousands.

Lower! Back to 7k so I can buy my family .1 bitcoins each for christmas!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:25
Hey cousin Joel! Sorry I only have enough to buy for 2 family members! If bitcoin really goes to the 10's of millions by the 2040's like they say then you can come live with me! I'll build you a house on the property i'll be able to acquire!

He wants to stop paying out dividents with stocks.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:15:44
yup, and intern they will make us a profit because of it. They will get pump and dumped like shitcoins, except they have a value already put behind their ICO's at the start of their release, so their is a lot more capital to take from them even at the start ;). Some of these companies are going to be robbed blind by the shitcoin flippers just waiting to take it all out at the right number.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:16:58
It's because those are the only coins he has. I have those coins too as well as some overs. So I'd be very upset if only that part of my investment lived and the rest were murdered for others coins.

What's OP's u/MasonicCoiner's Bitcoin wallet? I'd like to tip him for paving the way for Bitcoin exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:12:07
Last time I used an app like this, my phone burned in my pocket, the wallet the btc went to was unable to transfer the coins to my main wallet, and the wallet company soon went bankrupt losing my bitcoins that today would be worth around 2 grand. I'm not sure I wan't to risk breaking another phone for fake bitcoin in a fake wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:30:35
Doesn't cut them out, just keeps them from getting dividents on their investment, and every other investor as well.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:30:08
Credit is actually top teir, I can get a house loan with it. But why put up with making payments and buying a smaller house when I can buy it all in one crypto buy and not to mention a much bigger place than a loan could get me.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:55:04
Because I have enough bitcoin to be happy, but if I can gamble 100 dollars and turn it into 3000 then I can take that out before it crashes and get 3000 dollars of bitcoin for a 100 dollar investment. It's why I have about 100 dollars in every prominent shitcoins, the second it passes a threshold it goes right back into bitcoin. I'm satisfied with my shitcoin bets now so time to test out a new market, this one they're talking about. Sure some bets will die, but the ones that live make up more than enough to cover the dead bets and keep me at a ridiculous profit. Whats a lost 2k when you made 50k on the same round.

Companies like crypto better because now they don't have to pay out dividends.

yet anything being sold in the world can be found online being sold for bitcoin anyways that you can get it delivered, saying it's useless because not many physical stores accept it is like saying amazon is useless because you can't walk into a store, yet the fuckers own the market now. And fuck if you can buy a house and a car with bitcoin already then fuck it. I got a bigger house with my crypto than I ever could've gotten with a bank loan, a better car that I ever could've gotten with a car load too, also get to eat like a king eating whatever the fuck I want through the crypto version of postmates, shit there's even crypto ride share apps now. I haven't used fiat dollars in over 3 years thanks to the new market developing for crypto investors.

Yet it keeps dipping on my dip :(
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:29:14
To sell them when it get's high and convert them into bitcoins, a real digital currency you can buy anything with. I bought a house, car, and even a wife with bitcoin.
