Epstein being found dead surely validates this man's claims as a time traveler

Yea man thats what i meant... the details.

You and i also spoke threw dm from old_negotiation account I can verifiy it

There was a post he made early this morning bidding us farewell where did it go? Nvr mimd its at the top

I’d like to know more about quantum entanglement. as you must know 3-4 weeks ago physicists using   quantum computers sent 2 quibits of information back in time by a fraction of a second . I’m very interested in hearing about the entanglement you talk about ease elaborate as I can see this is the first stage of chrononauting

He’s not the same guy he said that  luke guy used quantum entanglement to send “information” backwards. Which ironically a couple weeks ago March 2019 there was a break threw in quantum physics  that sent 2 quitbits worth of information back in time by a fraction of a second .....coincidence? I doubt it..

I’d like to share that about 3 weeks ago quantum physicists  made a huge break threw. They successfully sent 2 quitbits of information back in time using quantum computers by a few fractions of a second. With the technology doubling effect how long before they can send back whatever and when ever they want?

The world sometimes disgusts me  withholding such a amazing piece of tech. In fact that generator would power quantum hashing. Furthermore the original generator is locked away somewhere stolen from the great mind of John Searl. Unlimited energy and anti levity vehicles could be here right now

Yea I presented a question as I’m like you and closely watch the technology around time travel. I believe the genie will be out of the bottle soon though. Too many advancements by too many people to keep it secreted away

What about Apollo all in one currency? Any insight on it my friend ?

Two interesting Facts to point out from this interesting story is as follows. The author points out in 2013 that Lichtenstein is a crypto citadel. ironically maybe two months ago 2019  Lichtenstein declared itself a neutral territory sponsoring cryptocurrency. Also there has been a amazing breakthrew March 2019 where quantum computers sent 2 quibits worth of information back in time by fractions of a second. With technology advancement doubling each year how long before they can send anything they want backwards in time?

Thanks for the info, does the SEG John Searl invents come to be? Searl effect generator uses magnetic imprinting to create energy and levitation due to superconductivity ?
