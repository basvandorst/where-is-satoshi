if _I_ was my parents I'd let my kid know what i thought, tell him I'm not going to help him out financially if it all goes south, and then let him do what the hell he wants with his money he worked for.... honestly I expected them to be excited that I was thinking about money years down the road... it might be unconventional, and it IS risky, but I think it's a more mature way to spend my money than buying video games...
PS i absolutely think knowing something about the tech is important to determining its potential value, while I'll also admit the other factors you list are equally if not more important to determining the present day price

This is a good idea, but my friends are equally convinced it's a scam.. I got turned on to the stuff by a cool kid at camp this summer, and now I'm alone and everyone I know thinks btc is retarded &amp; dead

mom: "You're going to believe this guy?  He even looks like a weasel!"
@_date: 2014-10-25 02:33:06
thanks for the pity &amp; for the btc :)

hahaha oh my god man "dance in the rain" ahhaha joie de vivre mmmmmm yes treasure these garden state moments

1. Appreciate the warnings but I was p much aware of all this
2. I/We live in a police state homes, and it's not just surveillance, if you're ever in rhode island we should grab a pop and talk about it man I'll blow your mind; you'll be red-pilling, getting chased by agents... it'll be mad real
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:35:20
I think that's true, but my understanding of tech eclipses theirs by a pretty long shot imo :-/
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:38:35
I don't know what that is but it's probably alienating &amp; cool
@_date: 2014-10-25 07:34:43
hmmm yes... this makes a lot of sense and sounds good :o)
@_date: 2014-10-25 03:45:59
hahaha christ man maybe someday but that's a lil much for me time-wise at the moment... if I did THEN they'll say "Well maybe it's brilliant programming but who's to say it'll be worth something someday, the government will NEVER let that happen" which is imo a more intelligent argument, and they still won't let me gamble $40.
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:30:47
.... I'm pretty sure that'd raise some red flags on my bank statement (She's a joint holder on my account)
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:17:28
pm'ed ya!
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:37:56
hey I don't know shit about the technicals but I also wouldn't take anything like that for granted
@_date: 2014-10-25 03:15:14
Dude you are an absolute don :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 02:34:00
more or less
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:42:39
I have told her that, she responded with threats, and i've debated going against her will because I know my bitcoin would outlast any grounding they might dish out!  2 weeks in the house might be the extra price I pay over the Circle markup :3
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:29:53
I think this is good advice.. just gotta find someone who'll pay me for the music i make (I think it'd be very fitting in a video game!)
@_date: 2014-10-25 05:10:16
Broskie I know it's not a lock or anything.. I think there's a lot of room left for it to grow, a lot of innovation yet to unfold... And yeah, that's speculation.  It's $40 man, and I'm in high school, and yeah, I do think it's cool.  
In the end, my best-case-scenerio ($$$-wise) is that the powers that be somehow co-opt it, remove most everything that makes it pro-freedom, and encourage its use (or some other blockchain, UScoin or whatever) as an easily traced cash system... I dunno, in a post-snowden america, I tend to think if something is getting paraded around as a threat to the government, it's actually going to be harnessed to aid in some nice tyranny...
but what do i know, i'm just a young pup!!!
Edit: Honestly truly appreciate your concern &amp; input tho, don't worry, not gonna go overboard :)

Just link us to your favorite FDR episodes :)

Hahahaha everyone thinks I'm enough of a freak without me holding forth on digital money for a solid hour.  I get what you mean though and I've definitely taken the "it's not for drugs, hear me out" line with them, but they'll never, ever, ever, ever believe me over what they read in newspapers!  When a real establishment smartypants comes out in support of btc, then they'll consider it, but not a minute sooner.

I'll get something put together for you! :)
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:37:41
Hey thanks a lot man!! 
Yes I work (paper route) ... $40 is... not nothing but I definitely don't think it's a lot of money either... I dunno I more or less know the risks (worst case scenerio $40 --&gt; $0)
Either way man it's probably good advice you gave, and I rly appreciate the tip!  Thanksx2
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:28:16
1. It goes a lot deeper than the NSA and metadata my man, a LOT deeper, won't say more here but the weapons They use to maintain a favorable public order aren't just men with a badge. (IRS is an easy example here)
2. It's a reference to "The Matrix," I don't actually think you're going to be chased by agents if I hit you with my conspiracy theories over a nice diet cola
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:49:14
Cool, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:36:20
Pm'ed you... don't wanna violate any rules... thanks a ton mane
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:46:23
I'm certain your right on both counts, but I _want_ some bitcoin, and I don't think it's either life-threatening or a detriment to my character to risk some dollaz on some coinz :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 02:38:16
I dunno buddy, I don't think bitcoin itself could be a scam.  Yes, I know scammers could use it, I understand the basic structure of pumping/dumping (though the specifics of how one could pull it off are sorta complex)... and it might very well be overvalued now, and definitely might not have a bright future, but I don't think that makes it a scam.  Just risky.  I've been told this is the age I can afford to make a risky call or two!
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:39:37
This is more or less what I've tried to tell them (except that last part about satoshi's BTC, interesting)... wish I could word it as nicely as you though
@_date: 2014-10-29 08:04:21
oh and I wouldn't put so much faith in tor and pgp man... yeah they're cool but I don't think there are any guarantees that they really protect you against NSA snoops... 
And yes satoshi is downright inspiring and bitcoin seems like a powerful, subversive technology............... but you never know... so much is intentional in the mediadark united states... so much of the narrative is polished... part of me definitely wonders about satoshi being the NSA, about bitcoin being a large-scale testnet for whatever megacorp snoopcoin the bilderbergs/rothschilds roll out...
Anyway man I'm glad you're enthusiastic but if you're not sweating &amp; second guessing everything in a dervish of paranoia you're not ancapping right imo.  I don't think stef agrees but he is a zionist shill.  call me
ps i know this post is a little weird but I'm serious as a heart attack
@_date: 2014-10-25 04:17:20
You're right, of course. :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 03:29:50
yeah yeah yeah......
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:39:59
I dig that
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:06:18
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2014-10-25 03:52:11
I would rather be loaded as well as never let them live it down.  They don't know my passwords, and it's not like they're going to waterboard the btc outta me.  Besides, I seriously doubt a surge to $10k is in the near future... I want this in case BTC's hot hot hot in 5 years or so... but what the hell do/does I/anyone know about where the price is going?
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:15:29
This seems pretty sage.  Thanks.
