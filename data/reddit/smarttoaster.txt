Don't feed the troll guys.

It's just going to take time at this point. People on the fence that were thinking about adopting probably got pushed away by the Gox fiasco. But when people start seeing that it is safe to use BTC will start gaining the confidence of adopters again. It could be a long, slow downward trend/sideways trend.

I'm right there with you. I'm basically throwing everything I was trading with back into cold storage and I'm not going to check anything for a year. Will I do it? I doubt it but I really want to.

I've been away from BTC for over a year and this article was sent to me by a friend so I decided to come see what the community was saying. Your comment is exactly why BTC is doomed to fail at this point. One shitty article posted on Medium and the price starts tanking. This is the true laissez faire system everyone wanted and then bitches about it at the same time.

That's cost prohibitive to 99% of the people out there interested in contributing.

The rest of your post isn't even worth reading.

This doesn't even make sense dude.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:41:29
Oh for fuck's sake.

My opinion of BTC was that it was the MySpace to Facebook. There are too many fundamental issues prohibiting it from becoming adopted by the general global population.

Isn't this a problem though? One article causes major economic damage. Isn't that kinda the whole point he's basically making?

Not sure but every comment I make is getting downvoted. Haven't been on here in about six months until this article dropped. Is that a new "feature" of @_date: 2016-01-15 07:34:30


So BTC?
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:07:27
Pretty much

I'm pretty much you. I spent quite a bit of time learning the technicalities and then with all the bull shit in early 2015 I stopped watching. This article was emailed to me by a friend and so I came here to see what was going on. What a vile place has become.


Hear, hear! I'm out too. It's pretty clear to me that it will never be widely adopted and it's going to slowly trend down. I always said BTC was the MySpace to Facebook. I think cryptocurrency has a future, it's just not BTC.

People are scared. A lot of people in here are mad because they're losing money.
