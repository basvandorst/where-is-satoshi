You seem to be working with your own made up definition of entropy; that's cool I guess.


I'll take this as the answer to my question.  I'd be onboard with a form of 'communism' that naturally emerges, but I also don't think it's possible.  Like utopia.  Here's hoping...

No, it's not the normal one.  You stated that it is "the process of dividing simple things up and recombining them in novel ways, forming new, more complex things" -- entropy is actually the opposite of that.
I never said one's body is a utopia.  How did you infer that?

Entropy is a measure of the *unavailability* of energy within a system.  The extreme end of this (maximum entropy) is thermodynanamic equilibrium where nothing can possibly happen because all matter is at a uniform temperature and already resting in it's lowest energy state.  There is no life at this point.  There is no complexity.
Yes, I said the form of communism you described that naturally emerges is like utopia.  But that is not me saying that organisms/bodies are utopia because, despite your analogy, bodies are not the same thing as [your described version of] communism.

Entropy and evolution are very different things.  If anything they are opposites.
And what the heck does


mean?  What organisms are forming planets?
If I'm to guess at your answer to my question it's: no, you don't think communism can be implemented politically; but you do think it will emerge as an evolutionary inevitibility.  Is that accurate?

Great.  Do you think that definition of communism can be implemented politically?

The simpler reason is that people like their btc more than their fiat.  Why would anyone pay with the thing they'd prefer to keep?

I dont think this align's to the point the OP was making.  And there isn't really anyway to own lost bitcoin, (at least not that is more specific than the way in which I might 'own' all other bitcoin in existence given that all addresses containing it are equally opaque to me).
The example of the lost stones speaks to the lack of need for a currency to have any intrinsic value.

Oh, perfect.  In that case I also need a couple ferraris, a 10,000 sqft home with pool and tennis court, a triple-crown winning racehorse, and a harem of women.  Oh, and better get me a moon-bound spaceship; I have quite a passion for space travel, too.

Wow, your sophistry is so voluminous you've created your own subreddit to contain it.  Impressive.
Ever consider that historical purveyors of communism were as naive as you are about human nature so as to believe they could achieve "actual" communism when in reality the results were quite different?
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:36:57
This is hilarious.
Communism doesn't work, btw.

Of course historic instances of communism weren't *actual* communism in Turil's mind.
You seem to be working from a much different conception of communism than I am.  Perhaps we can find a mutually agreeable definition to work from so as to make this more prodictive.  I'll start:
Communism == "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"
Does that work?

Soviet Union.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:36:25
Well I need a 50' yacht.  In your version of "actual" communism would this be provided to me "freely [by] the system"?
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:17:47
How could I possibly be addicted to things I don't have?  I *need* these things, and I'm very grateful to hear that in your system of "actual communism" I will be granted them freely.  (And thank you for checking your judgements about my state of freedom or repression at the door because, after all, *I'm* the only authority who can rightly assess what it is that I actually need.)
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:52:53


Sure; because it doesn't work...


Who would measure/decide what any individual needs in your version of *actual* communism?

Miners don't really get to demand anything.  They mine if the profits on offer are sufficiently compelling; if they're not, they don't.

You may 'like' cryptos, but you don't really understand them.
