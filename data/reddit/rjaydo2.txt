What’s the best way to ensure the US forms a coalition against a “common enemy”? Declare it a national threat. Worked with WWII, Iraq, WOMD, why not now? It’d be incredibly depressing if comments and pressure like this actually convinced people to not adopt BTC at the very least as a new PayPal-esque method of transaction.

Wipe the whole damn thing. Format the hard drive and re install the OS, throw the fuckin hard drive out of the window and buy a new one maybe. Still that might not even work

I wouldn’t say it’s high because it’s being manipulated but that it isn’t higher because it is. Any time price is driven by a couple large sells it is dropped as well. Chart rises steadily for a week, then one person sells 200 BTC and we are back where we started
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:57:58
^ talk about case in point lmao
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:05:22
Yes but a year + a day for capital gains tax could be 0% (depending on salary)
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:57
More so impossible. Can’t kick yourself over something like that
@_date: 2019-06-14 01:24:44
Lmfao salty as hell
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:42:34
It’s volatile so that makes it even harder to invest or predict correction. Best bet is get in when you can. It can shoot up and you’ll be waiting for correction forever possibly
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:09
It’s already back up to 12.5k
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:33:13
Well done

Quantum right now has to be performed in nearly 0 kelvin of which large companies only have the infrastructure and $ to provide such an enclosure. Also, most quantum computers used now are doing much more important tasks (calculating distances/flight trajectories in space, etc). Until they start to make drastic breakthroughs on quantum in room temperature, of which the last time I saw a “breakthrough” was essentially a bs article, there won’t be any effect I believe.

Yeah if you: 
- Predicted some whale was going to sell at 13.5k
- Set Buy and sell orders based upon their sell
- Knew they were going to sell 3-400 BTC (4-5 million USD worth) 
- The softwares computed the orders quickly enough 
All within minutes
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:49:08
It’s been pretty much instant then maybe 30 mins top to move to a wallet
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:46:04
Oh yeah I’ve actually been using Cash app for buying, just kinda enjoy the Coinbase app for all the amenities (graphs, alerts, etc). How does one sign up for pro and what’s the cost?
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:06:03
Large companies riding the BTC wave and making huge profits
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:12:23
It's going to be a very long time until room temp quantum computing is solved. Near 0K is already hard enough to reach and there have not been any noticeable leaps in the field.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:37:44
Makes sense. I guess I haven’t invested enough to feel targeted but will be soon enough here. Also, what’s the best way to be selling BTC from a hardware wallet then? That’s where I’ve been hesitant and stuck with leaving on a coinbase wallet. If the price Plummets/skyrockets I want to be out when I see it. I guess I’m worried about turn around time on selling
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:10:12
Find your niche! Well done for your age
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:16:08
What are your thoughts on Coinomi? I have one set up right now and has an app on iPhone
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:23:00
I feel decently safe with 2fa. Understandably that is possible to hack still but will take some social engineering of which I’m pretty perceptive to
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:36:16
My bad Cash App account was closed without explanation and Coinbase still not verified yet or else I would’ve bought at $6800 sooo that was awesome
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:37:04
Most likely a troll I would say
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:10:07
I had em ready just was not prepared for Cash app to close my account out of nowhere lmao. But I should’ve verified my account before so still on me
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:36:01
Ledger recommendations? Thank you for the response too
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:04:22
Careful with Cash App. I was using and had my account closed without any explanation and their support is atrocious. I would have two different methods of buying so you’re not like me and miss this dip!
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:37:32
Oh no :/ damn sorry man
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:39:55
Lmfao thank you
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:57:25
If I were you I would wait for this to drop again. 30% increase over a small amount of time is calling for a large correction
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:52:33
I’m new to all of this, but in my mind I would think leaving coin on Coinbase is more secure than a wallet. Not that it can’t be hacked, but if it does my BTC is covered by coinbase. If my wallet somehow gets hacked, I’m just SOL. Right or wrong?
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:38:37
It’s definitely the cheapest option but just a heads up if someone is lured in by fee-less thinking it means free
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:31:23
Yeah I’m learning that pretty quickly. Got a buddy that’s been in for a while giving me the same advice
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:47:14
Possibly. That’s a damn shitty reason to drop me because I’m not giving enough reason as I’m still giving them $ while buying the BTC due to their inflation but “no fees” thing, so I damn well hope it wasn’t that. I’ve got a Coinomi wallet and coinbase and just sent to my coinbase for the time being. I had it sitting in the cash app “wallet” for a little while
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:42:00
Yeah I could withdraw it luckily but they just closed the damn thing and all they send is an email saying “sorry for the inconvenience you violated a term” yada yada
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:06:48
Not sure about the content as much but I respect the hustle. Keep it up
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:50:16
Yes but they inflate the price that you are paying for BTC at the time to account for their “fee-less” transaction, but I prefer them with how easy it is to buy..that is when I had an account. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:43:20
Sadly they don’t seem very responsive and send a generic response each time so far. Thank you though I’ll keep reaching out
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:29:25
Hold me I’m scared
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:34:05
first time in BTC having the scare of my life I almost sold ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:35:44
Thank you. What are the best ledgers to look into? I have a Coinomi wallet, not sure what that falls under
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:39:21
I expected it to happen just the first time I’ve seen my money disappear that quickly. Reaccumulation. Is that why you say so?
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:29:01
I can still withdraw the amount I believe (or so they say)
