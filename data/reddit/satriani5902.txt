There is a nicehash Reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:34:58
Wow didn't know FTC was so old 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:07:30
Not recommended. You won't start mining until feb 28. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:28:04
You understand that futures are contracts? Haha they don't care about the BTC. They make more money buying and selling contracts. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:48
Who knows? $0?!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:37:12
Will likely be cash settled. But we shall see :o
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:53:26
What i do: 2 times a month. Deposit into coinbase usd wallet, transfer to GDAX, purchase btc at Market price (Lower fees), transfer back into coinbase or into my private wallet. Repeat. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:38:31
How do you avoid those high BTC fees?!?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:47:55
Yes be ready
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:21:30
Not a scam. 
Don't think they do refunds anyways.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:45:24
 Both, look up asset allocation. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:45:31
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:32:22
Agreed, going sub $2k then the question is $100 or sub $100???
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:37:13
Charting is good at looking at past but almost useless for future. Too many unknowns.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:57:38
Nice analysis!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:38:27
Doubt it's game over but maybe bear market for the year.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:58:44
Yep been there a while. But I'm holding my BTC and spending fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:28:38
Also don't put in more than you can afford to lose. Example, I'm only using 2% of my PF. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:46:35
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:47:34
Good point, what is the current costs of mining a coin? ASIC miners are going to get rekt.
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:29:06
Yes steemit
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:24:13
That's low, what wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:30:05
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:18:54
What wallet are you using???
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:46:24
Yep saw someone book their travel with BTC 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:00:53
Deposit usd into coinbase and use the market/limit function on GDAX since the services are connected. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:25:46
Yeah but I couldn't stomach most of my PF in crypto. No sleep haha
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:08:36
i am sure soon.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:08:22
only one coin has a negative correlation with bitcoin (and not all the time just avg)...that is DASH.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:23:57
Works well for me. 
-Bot trades volatility of BTC. 
-  on coinmarketcap.com
- referrals not needed to earn
- @ 40% ROI with no referrals and not interested in getting them. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:47:39
Deposit to USD WALLET on coinbase. Buy BTC/ETH  using gdax(run by coinbase) for lower fees than coinbase.
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:44:22
Ease your way in. Don't need to go all in on first purchase. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:33:12
Expedia I heard too 
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:20:26
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:37:24
Ok so how does this work? Anyone tried it? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:18:51
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:14:31
Crypto is 2% of my PF. Look at your risk and safety buckets. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:45:42
What's ledgerx symbol? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:40:35
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:01:00
Aren't mortgage payments tax deductible? I think you should consult with a tax advisor.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:23:28
Damn you need $5m to short BTC 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:43:47
2% into BTC. It could more realistically go to zero vs stocks.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:54:02
Take 50% profits?
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:12:24
That's an incredible return :/
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:55:34
Great idea- Christmas gifts! 
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:18:27
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:19:29
Define scam. 
I think it's a bad investment.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:04:07
Take profit at 45-50%
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:51:27
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:00:24
i see your point, but will let other people spend it :)
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:28:20
Paywall :(
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:49:27
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:24:12
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:49:28
Yeah slow on shapeshifter too
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:31:04
One day, but it's too volatile now
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:22:04
Even some stocks dupe people..look at Enron and Worldcom.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:42:40
None that I am aware
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:25:30
All weather mats for my car :)
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:17:10
Taking some profits at $5k yes. Need some for the pullback :)
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:23:42
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:02:23
How do you know?
