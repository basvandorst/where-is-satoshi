I am glad to hear this. Does this speak for the overall atmosphere of talk for alternative cyrpto-currencies, perhaps? Last year there were hundreds of alts trying to take off on Bitcoin's rise. Now we still have hundreds (if not over a thousand), but also a graveyard of coins. The coins that did not make it are the ones worth learning from for future improvement upon Bitcoin, IMO.

Oh, great. More *fantastic* news related to Facebook making moves. /s
I think it's a ploy to cater stock holders, FB has been down to $45 before the end of last year. Now, up to over $60. 
In any case, it will most likely be nothing for the Bitcoin and cryptocoin communities to worry about. Unless they start fucking with all of the markets after they start accepting crypto.

They do offer sattelite internet, however. **It is not unlimited internet access.**
They have 3-tiers of internet (5GB cap 5mbps, 10GB cap 10mbps, and 15GB cap 10mbps, [source]( that you would need to bundle with other services in order to have.
Now, I can't say how good their internet is but I don't think I'd switch from unlimited to capped internet. I fucking hate counting peanuts in terms of data usage. I just went from a 200MB cap to 2GB cap on my smartphone data plan. Shit, I could probably get better internet tethering from my smartphone's provider.

Yeah I was upset over this and get hung up on the word usage. I heard them broadcast the same thing over the radio on NPR today. Calling bitcoin a virtual currency.
Virtual Currency implies that it's like in-game money you exchange real money for in order to buy items.
Digital Currency is what bitcoin is because you can use it to purchase hard assets.

Accessability/availability is a valid point. I suppose that this helps open up internet accessability for people living in such areas without options. Furthermore, there are places world-wide where I can imagine bitcoin would be a more viable way to purchase items, such as internet services. One example which comes to mind would be a country lacking the infrastructure in broadband internet, that has better infrastructure for smartphones in comparison, could end up positively benefiting from this. I don't know how good the service would be but the fact of the matter is that you may not have a choice.

In a world of competing sensational media, as well as a big, developing news story such as mt. gox, bias is _everything_. I'm disappointed that the WSJ is short-quoting an entire interview of good publishable material.. We kind of knew something like this was coming, though.

I made a sub not too long ago which didn't exactly take off, however, it was .  I re posted an image of a 420chan thread about DMT synthesis. About to dig up a link..

Gettin real tired of your shit MPLA2424.. Who's your professor we keep hearing about? What uni do the both of you attend? Why does your professor keep doubting BTC, what does he say? 
If you can't answer these simple  questions in regard to what you've said, then I really don't think you deserve to be posting. From what I can gather from just observation alone is that all of this is a donation-scam.

The only way I can imagine this to make money is on the commission of being the middle-man in a merchant transaction. I suppose I'd be interested in giving an incentive to use this once it's out of beta. In order to stay competitive over other Btc merchant pay services this development would include similar pricing. Although, not identical. Monetization is a hefty process..

Thank you.
I am part of Slush's pool. Some shares have been 2000, 1400, 800, etc..
My theory is that my share gains have merely improved due to so many people are leaving because of the increased send threshold.

I think the internet moves too fast for WSJ, they're struggling to keep up on cryo-coin news. Even when I was taking the pictures to post the link with, *This is old news even if it was reported yesterday* is what I thought.  They published an article on BBQCoin three weeks ago, the title was really humorous; *Bbqcoin? Virtual Money Is Smoking.*

I am sorry, allow me to explain.
I doubled the total in my mining reward over night.
Which, I thought was worthy of saying I "doubled my money."
I should edit my post to clarify.. done. Thanks!

As well as it'd be similar to how bitpay conducts business for their merchants. I'm the other "friend" is referring to. We are maybe thinking of using their API. Not that this would be a rip-off of bitpay, if anything, it'd be a completely different brand of the kind of service being offered. Except, with the use of the Google Wallet.

This is the first time I've even heard of this show. I thought it was great to be caught up to speed with the information said in the first segment. The second segment with the interview was just okay. This Max guy will flip flop his personal views over whatever can accumulate wealth.
