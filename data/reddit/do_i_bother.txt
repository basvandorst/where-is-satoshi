There are breed specific rescues. 
Plus, it's much better to support a reputable breeder who tests the health of their dogs to better the breed than a pet store or casual breeder any day

This is true, but it's rarer to find an already rare breed as a puppy

You don't have a biological desire to buy or adopt a dog

Yeah, that means you went to a pretty reputable breeder. They don't let their dogs enter shelters and generally have a contact mandating the buyer spay or neuter the dog.

That's a thing. They take dogs from the south. People up north are generally better about fixing their animals, which is part of it. That's true. Sometimes rescues and shelters aren't honest or either don't know about the dogs enough. Most have fosters  can be really helpful with that. And yeah, breeders (reputable ones anyway) have a long list of standards to meet, as well as waiting lists.

Nothing makes you Satan. That doesn't mean that buying a breed like this (cavalier King Charles which already have massive health problems) from a pet store who sourced from a puppy mill is something people should look the other way at

Yeah, I know lots of people who don't even consider it because they think all shelter dogs are unstable and temperamental or that they are there for a reason. Most shelters do temperament testing and won't put aggressive dogs up for adoption. My dog is as sweet as can be and came mostly trained. It also depends on where you live. Shelters are super crowded in the south. My city puts down dogs after 72 hrs at the county shelter.

You pay for the medical costs and to help the org keep on running. They aren't making profit.
