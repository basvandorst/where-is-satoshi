I would be down for a little short action haha. Sold at 12,8 and have been regretting it like a mofo with this 20% hike
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:46:47
Bought at 10.8 and am hoping for a drop so I can buy more haha. Not thinking of selling until 2020

Generally speaking we have seen the big three rise and fall together. Today both ETH and LTC are down while BTC is skyrocketing. I’m worried it might be in prep to dump when CME group has their little shindig.

How does it work with coinbase. Should I move my Btc off so I can collect super bitcoin and sell?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:14:20
I consider myself pretty diversely invested but refuse to hold any BCH. They try to gain popularity by misleading and lying to newcomers to the crypto world and it's sad. Their subreddit is literally /btc...it's has almost 10x as many subs as the real subredditn /bitcoincash. The owner of bitcoin.com pushes for BCH not actual BTC. The wallet on the site and app automatically default to BCH. Sad and shady tactics is the reason they won't work.

You are an awesome person for this, will change countless people's lives. I am getting my mom to sign up Triangle Beagle Rescue which is in North Carolina. They rescue beagles who have been mistreated or are next up to be put down at shelters. She has had over 70 beagles come through our house before finding their "fur-ever homes." The sad reality of a resuce is that a lot of dogs need REAL rescuing. The one at our house right now just had a $4,000 surgery last night to help fix 3 broken legs that were caused by the previous owner. People are awful. She is very excited even if the non-profit is not chosen. This is an incredible idea and I wish you nothing but happy days!

Definitely sell and buy that car. That will pay for itself in 5 months. Buying a car off of crypto profit would be a huge achievement. Congrats!

I think you deleting your post shows you understand how silly it was to post in the first place.

DM me I’ll take em at 12k

I’ve been waiting terribly long for my decent sized bank transfer to show up in GDAX. Need just one or two more days before the road to 20k.

I just sold at 12,200 and bought all of this years Christmas gifts with ROI. Please no memes I would love to come back in at 10.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:13:08
I’ll take 150,000 coins for $20
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:57:55
I’ll give you $200 in BTC for it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:26:32
I too bought at 13,9. Seems to be the best sale of the day thus far. Solid buy
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:43:51
Moved over just a little bit of my savings into bitcoin. Was making $.04 per month in interest. I'm up $120 on my bitcoin in just the last two days.
