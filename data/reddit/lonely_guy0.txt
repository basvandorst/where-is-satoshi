LN isn't a side chain.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:04:51


One theory is that the earlier network congestion is not entirely caused by genuine transactions but by deliberate spam. The spammer has a political agenda to either raise bitcoin's block size via a hard fork (a backwards incompatible change) or to make more people use another coin called Bitcoin Cash or BCash (BCH) which has a higher maximum block size limit (raising block size would allow more transactions and would reduce fees due to less competition for space). However people are now starting to experiment with a new technology called 'Lightning Network' (LN) which offers instant transactions at near zero fees. LN can run on top of Bitcoin but not BCH. Seeing high fees is pushing people to use LN and not BCH the spammer stopped spamming.

The recent increase in tx fees is partly because of slow block discoveries because miners have left for bitcoin cash which is more profitable atm. After a few hours bch difficulty retarget will happen and it will be less profitable to mine than bitcoin and hashrate  will switch back to bitcoin.

Latest version doesn't reject 'transactions'. AFAIK what it does is lessen the chances of connecting to clients following different consensus rules like b2x which is good for both btc and b2x.
Core 0.15 stopped connecting to nodes advertising as s2x but Jeff Garzik added a patch to btc1 which would circumvent this for whatever reason. Note that even if Jeff did nothing it wouldn't have caused any disruption like a premature chain split. The more advanced logic in Core 0.15.1 is to make sure the client doesn't get stuck at the forking block if it happened to connect to covert btc1 clients only.

Electrum's official recommendation on how to redeem Bitcoin Cash: 


 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your Electrum wallets.
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet, entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds at risk.

Consider the following transactions with and without batching:

change(n-1) -&gt; usern + changen

In the case with batching there are less outputs and unique addresses used (change1, change2, ... changen replaced by change).

X amount (which varied daily and RBI became Reverse Back of India reversing decisions daily) per person per day (don't remember if it's per day or just once) is for exchanging old notes for new ones. You could deposit any amount provided you had a KYCed account and can prove the amount wasn't black money or unaccounted cash. You would have to stand in long queues to change notes and that was the only 'banking' happening in the country. The first narrative was to curb black money and terrorist funding. Then it became promoting digital economy. Anyway I know a few people who never paid taxes and had a lot of cash who where able to launder with ease. According to some reports prior to demonetisation as much as half the money circulating could be black. However ~ 99% of notes came back and so curbing black money stunt had very little success. The last date for depositing/exchanging old notes was December 30 2016 and through an RBI office till March 2017 iirc. Now even possessing 10 old notes is illegal (lol). The country had negative GDP growth. "I promise to pay the bearer the sum of one thousand rupees" (signed RBI governer) became the joke of the decade. Also the move was ill executed. More money came back than the government calculated and there was a cash shortage for several months even after the last date to deposit/exchange old notes. Banks started giving soiled notes, the new note sizes were incompatible with ATM machines, etc. Anyway the narratives sold well and helped the ruling party in some elections in north Indian states that followed.
