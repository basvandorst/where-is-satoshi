here's the thread 
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:05:31
Of course where else? It's just Okcasino and Bitfinhacks. Maybe Bitmex? Naah, worse liquidity than Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:52:20
Inquiry: regarding deposit, trading, exchange wallet addresses - So, I sent BTC 24 hours ago to the deposit address and then to the trading address and back to the exchange address and back to the trading address. All this time making profit. Are these addresses independent of each other? Last I left the btc, it was in the trading wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:23:09
Let us be clear: 1: We, the Bitfinex customers, have no control of the BTC addresses because your company and Bitgo alone have the private keys. 2: This is a not an individual BTC fund holder's loss, you've been robbed, not us. Reinbursements are for everyone who has funds in your exchange, BTC, ETH, USD, ETC. Don't assign loss individually. So what if I only have dollars in the exchange? You lost the bitcoins, not us. If you need guidance from damage control, ask Poloniex. Also, it is important that you resume ASAP and not turn into a BTER situation. Otherwise, you will lose loyal customers.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:02:12
Launch BFXcoin!
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:12:51
With fiat? If they could, they would have long ago. Better suggestion is margin trade altcoins with BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:29:17
Suggestion: Let's say 119K BTC is 15% - 20% of all the assets Bitfinex is holding prior to hack. I think you should make available 80% - 85% of all the user's funds when the exchange goes live. The remainder you can pay back incrementally over time. Better act fast and not remain quiet for so long.
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:31:04
More than 12 hours withdrawal is still processing. 12:30pm CEST now I believe.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:29:45
If you're not actively trading, always use offline storage.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:52:41
You want them to declare bankrupcy and fold shop? Good luck to us, getting funds out in 5 years+
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:31:20
I don't think so. It was not a user-initiated transaction. The hack involved private keys which is not in the user's hands. If it's done through Bitfinex withdrawal process with 2FA and/or email confirmation, then the customer is liable.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:55:28
Awesome suggestion. Though, I disagree on some parts.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:11:59
It's a test, every company needs to run the gauntlet. Amazon suffered during the dotcom crash, look at them now.
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:00:24
What? I thought Bitfinex is just a wallet :D I'm too lazy to use my own.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:50:08
Traders won't abandon if Bitfinex handles this above board like what Poloniex did before. Anticipating ANN [BFX] Bitfinexcoin coin supply of 119,756BFX
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:10:15
No, Poloniex had a disastrous hack.
@_date: 2016-08-09 06:26:35
Well, he knows Bitfinex used to be number one BTCUSD exchange. If we are truly bullish on bitcoin, it could be a billion dollar exchange in 10 years. It's quite hard to built an exchange from scratch. The exchange is a golden goose, albeit, abused and raped by hackers and shenanigans. But still, it performed well, trade volume-wise. They are grasping at straws keeping it under their control.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:20:27
It will be like E t h e r e u m C l a s s i c
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:40:46
There is still a chance. Top BTCUSD exchange/top brand. Someone might rescue them in exchange for part-ownership or buy the exchange off them. Heck, BTER was rescued.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:35:04
Will the BFX token be pegged and redeemed in BTC? Because I will consider this as my long term hold if yes. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:55:07
The platform minus security is one of the best. Hell, most platforms are not that secure anyway - If it's online, it's hackable. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:51:25
Mainstream will be the last to hoard with lesser profit potential because more clueless. Bought all my corns at $176. It could still be cheap now, we'll see from the market movements.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:42:36
During the early months of Poloniex, they had a devastating hack  I wouldn't mind if some of my funds is slowly paid out in time. I guess we will be bagholding some BTC for months
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:09:53
I'm sure there are takers for the world's largest bitcoin/USD exchange with 5x the volume over the next USD exchange. We have a crypto bull market, DAO raised $150m, Ethereum is almost a billion marketcap. Even Ethereum Classic's rise is unprecedented. Bitfinex will only fall if the owners handle this crisis with stupidity.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:40:14
Nah, if they handle this crisis brilliantly, they can resurrect. Poloniex did.
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:02:08
It indeed seems grim. But we haven't yet heard from them. You can't see what's next until they say something.
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:17:11
Have you heard of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO)? Effectively you bought $1: 1 BFX
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:39:42
I meant policies and details because the gist of your messages are: You don't know and the company is still investigating. It's already clear you lost part or all our money. What will you do about it? I think one day is enough.

I hope they can emulate Poloniex recovery

Wait for "Why not use decentralized exchanges for trading" arguments.
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:21:20
To the OP, I think it's also in our best interests that all affected users (future shareholders) should have one voice represented by a union or association. Anybody willing to fill leadership roles?

 and inspiring recovery

Never heard of an open market with a price floor
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:04:37
It's a shame if Bitfinex doesn't survive this, right when the time is now for Bitcoin startups to grow exponentially into billion dollar ventures in the future. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:15:14
No one is happy about the criminals. But they have no faces and the exchange is stupid to rely on Bitgone.

Hey We appreciate a roadmap or whitepaper for this before trading it. Maybe an announcement thread at Bitcointalk? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:41:10
Some of the suggestions here  are a great solution 50% - 70% withdrawable funds now, the remainder in IOU tokens (Bitfinexcoin?) with interests, redeemable in 3 - 5 years?
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:57:19
No...It will dump first as the stupid herd will sell fast and low and then the smart money will wait for the bottom and then buy low. The price will definitely rally, the disbelievers will whine, the traders/investors will buy (hoping to sell at profit). But then it will crash again to an equilibrium price (price discovery). This phenomena is common to all markets and called "market cycle."

That's why the earliest investors makes the most profit (also most risk). Imagine investing in bitcoin three years from now.

100% of the coins? Where will they get the money to pay you that?

@_date: 2016-08-07 09:45:12
Dude, no one will buy to donate. But if it's listed, the price may rally. You don't know if there are someone interested in acquiring a piece of the Bitfinex pie. Hell, many shitcoins pump for no reason at all and you may actually come out ahead.
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:34:31

Also, best time to add 10x leverage for the degenerate gamblers :D
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:36:53
If there's honor with Bitfinex, the haircut is going to be temporary or none at all. Let's say 60% withdrawable, 40% represented in IOU tokens with interests.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:54:04

@_date: 2016-08-07 15:13:14
Because it's an accounting nightmare. The time of the hack is spread out in several hours while the discovery was a bit too late. The bitcoins stolen was never static in Bitfinex's books, it was used for buying/selling USD, ETH, ETC and LTC. How on earth can you roll back trades that occur between hack and discovery? What if in the several hours of the incident I managed to double my ETC/BTC or USD stash using the stolen BTC? So, how do you suppose to assign loss with that scenario?
A site-wide cut regardless if you manage to double your US dollars by buying and selling seems fair enough.
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:55:49
What a disaster of biblical proportions. Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:07:22
Err..not insolvent but the theft definitely set them back.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:21:16
If you don't possess the private keys, it's not in your possession. It may be yours, but you don't control it. Just like banks, your fiat is yours but the banks can do whatever with it because you don't control it, only when the paper currency is in your actual wallet (fungability)
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:27:47
Like Bitgo
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:07:01
The name, reputation, volume traded, userbase has value. It's not easy to be the number one bitcoin exchange, even if you poured enough investments in it (look at Coinbase). 
Besides, one reason they maybe delaying is because they are attempting to catch/negotiate with the thief. I don't know.
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:58:32
Err.. even with Bitfinex, you don't even have 1/3 control. Bitfinex holds two keys (which is stupid, by the way) and Bitgone. You may own the bitcoins, but you have no control over it. LOL, you have  more control with traditional deposit boxes in banks because you need an actual key to open it.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:25:24
On one hand, some people will sell it to you at any price. While on other hand, some VCs might find this an opportunity to buy Bitfinex ownership really cheap. If it's going to be traded on other exchanges, expect strong selling and buying.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:58:06
I think this approach of assigning losses to a subset of users before announcing any roadmap or plans for reinbursements is scaring people. Of course, no one wants any losses and people who think they can get away unscathed will fight for it while those who are hurted by Bitfinex's bad security practices will want reduced losses too.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:29:16
Yeah, and Bitfinex is much more real and proven profitable and working (minus all hacking incidents). 2016 is the year when a lot of money are coming in for crypto, just look at Steem, Ethereum Classic, NEM, Lisk, DigixDAO and Waves. People will buy and hold "shitcoins."  @_date: 2016-08-10 03:07:22
Like wow, hindsight :D
@_date: 2016-08-09 08:53:54
The goal at this point in time is to get out as much money as fast as you can. Threatening companies prematurely is never a good strategy.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:25:09
Sore you didn't buy? $594 now. Sell at $626 to $654.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:38:18


Will you stop saying customer losses? You've been robbed, not us.

It's all about liquidity and popularity. An analogy of this is the US Dollar versus Yen, Euro, British Pound, Turkish Lira, etc. Bitcoin is the USD of cryptocurrencies. It has the most liquidity and most number of exchanges. When the USD is soaring, all other fiat exhibit the same downward price action.
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:51:08

@_date: 2016-06-15 18:14:47
That's your change address, which is normally not seen with the wallet UI. But if you use dumpaddresses command, you can see all your addresses. In the HD version, it's a bit complicated.

It means the likelihood of a bounce or reversal to the upside is the strongest - possibly the reversal of the drop from $13k. The final shakeout of the weak hands.
