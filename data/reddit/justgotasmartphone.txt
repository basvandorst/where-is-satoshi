Dear Sir or Madam,
I am a bitcoiner, and I would like to trade you a string of letters and numbers for some goods in your boutique. I am 35, I have a ponytail, I live in my parents' basement and I'm in a continuous cycle of "getting my shit together". When I'm not smoking weed or playing Magic: The Gathering, I make up cryptocurrencies with other like minded people on the Internet. Actually, Bitcoin was invented by a Japanese guy named Satoshi Nakamoto but no one can prove who he is except this one guy from California has the same name but he denies he was involved with Bitcoin, but I don't believe it. Sorry if this sounds a little strange, I hope it makes sense so far. Anyway, Bitcoin is actually a string of numbers and letters that people mine off the Internet through a process called Bitcoin mining. This is what makes it both so secure and so unique. We believe that the fiat US dollar has no intrinsic value, and that instead our string of letters and numbers has more worth. 99% of Bitcoin transactions are drug related, but I promise you it's legit because of the blockchain. The main Bitcoin bank used to be a place to trade Magic cards, but it recently went out of business. Actually they stole the money, but the guys I talk to on reddit think it won't happen again. If you don't yet understand Bitcoin, let me rephrase it as an analogy with familiar terms, "Bitcoin is to Minecraft as PayPal is to Candy Crush." 
Thank you.

To a lot of people, to link is benign. I for one believe I have discovered a massive cover-up, and I've made it my life goal to bring this shit out in the open for everyone to see. Basically when someone is playing Minecraft, their computer is functioning (unknowingly to the user) as a node among a giant cluster, which can suck the cock right off the very best of Bitcoin miners. So while you're playing Minecraft, some big shot is getting rich off your efforts. Get it? Got it. I don't have any evidence yet to prove my theory, but that's what I'm hoping to find in the near future.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:37:52
Basically it's all a big scam. Every minute that someone is playing Minecraft, they're actually mining Bitcoins for some big fat cat hot shot.

@_date: 2014-01-10 05:16:01
I believe there is a conspiracy currently going on with this whole coin craze. It seems to me that Minecraft and Bitcoin are one and the same. All the computers running Minecraft are working in sync to mine Bitcoins. Why else would they call it MINEcraft? Not only are they working together as a trojan software, but also there is the added human touch to speed up the algorithm. So some big fat cat hot shot is getting rich off the labor of others. I can't prove any of this, but it's just a gut feeling I can't let pass by. All the coin collectors on here don't believe me though, and I'm starting to realize they think I'm a lunatic.
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:58:07
I don't think it's a Ponzi scheme but I do think it is somehow related to Minecraft.

You think Bitcoin is a currency, so if it's a currency, your argument is correct. But whether you and a bunch of other ppl at think it's a currency doesn't matter. According to the IRS, Bitcoin is not a currency, so therefore you pay taxes in USD.

@_date: 2014-01-09 07:04:40
One computer alone is sentimentally small in terms of its contribution. But a cluster of servers working together.... and bam! You've got more BTC than Ho Chi Minh!
And no, not at all. Think about it. Bitcoin: Use your computer to "make money". Minecraft: Play a point and click game, but get duped into BTC mining. PayPal: upload money to shop on EBay. Candy Crush: Basically the same, you play and get ripped off., especially fat guys. I know it's a far out theory, but I have done my homework and I know I'm right.
Last point, consider all the knock off Bitcoins, such as Litecoin, Dogecoin and Coinye. Now think of all the knock off Candy Crush Sagas, such as Pokopang and Bejeweled Blitz.

Well considering there are better alternatives like Coinye and Dogecoin, and the soon to be launched FUBUcoin, are you really surprised by this manifestation?
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:37:00
I have put together a theory that Bitcoin and Minecraft are one and the same. When someone is playing Minecraft, their computer is in fact functioning as part of a vast array of nodes that, taken together, suck the cock right off the very best of Bitcoin miners. On top of that, the added human input saves on calculations. So what it comes down to is that some fat cat hot shot is getting rich from every click you and I make on Minecraft. Just think about it: Bitcoin is to Minecraft as PayPal is to Candy Crush Saga.

A derivative is the slope of the equation of a line.
y=mx+b, the derivative is just the constant m
y=x^2, the derivative is y'=2x
y=x^3, the derivative is y'=3x^2
One can also take a derivative of a derivative,
y'=2x, y''=2

For the average joe to accept bitcoins, it needs to have more uses than buying drugs, buying new swords on Minecraft, generating endless useless discussion on reddit and being used in obscure stores by cryptohipsters. It also needs a function where you can print off your bitcoins so there's none of this computer mining mumbo jumbo. I don't mean paper wallets. I mean actually print them straight off the blockchain, then put them back later when the time is right.

A sprinkle of BTC upon my head

I love Bitcoin and Minecraft, and I'm wholeheartedly working toward their eventual union as one heaping smorgasbord of software.

I believe that Bitcoin and Minecraft are the same thing. What do you think about that chump? Do you want me to teach you some HTML?

I have no idea what that means because I've never actually played Minecraft
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:41:17

Some Caribbean island countries and more recently some EU countries allow fast or instant citizenship or instant residency (and citizenship later) for major investors. Usually you have to invest about a million dollars, or employ 10+ people, or something like this. A few that come to mind (and I'm too drunk to Google) are Cyprus, Portugal and I think Austria (all of which are EU). As for the Caribbean, I forget which ones. A lot of countries also waive or reduce residency periods for people of certain professions, such as university professors.

You need to learn to use the search bar on the right hand side. But here's a quick summary to bring you up to speed.

focuses on Bitcoin mining.
Basically your post in here is equivalent to asking some Wall Steet hot shot how to open a mine to start digging for gold in the Amazon delta basin.

Bitcoin and Minecraft are merging. The mess in Crimea caused Bitcoin to plunge. Dogecoin is now sponsored by Nascar. Mountain Gox stole your bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto is actually a Japanaese guy named Satoshi Nakamoto. I want Leah to do a girlsgonebitcoin. Because a Japanese guy made Bitcoin, the Chinese are banning it. Some people are complaining that Bitcoin hasn't done enough to address LBGTQ rights and rites. And I am campaigning for moderator on @_date: 2014-03-30 17:38:02

They are re-mined on a Minecraft server.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:10:03
I honestly believe the two are connected, and I'm trying to uncover the conspiracy. Everyone collection these "coins" and everyone playing that game are turning the crank on something bigger, and likely sinister. I just haven't figured out how to prove it, or what it even is yet...
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:07:26
Do you mine FUBUcoin? I would be interested in getting some skrilla to pay some debts down.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:11:59
Do they have Bitcoin?

Can you explain what you mean?
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:18:55
Have you seen any evidence (anecdotal, explicit or speculative) that there is some sort of conspiracy/cover-up going on with Bitcoin and Minecraft?

"Whom do you think controls the majority of the discretionary income in the US of A?"
If you reword it as an answer to the question,
"**She** controls the majority of the discretionary income in the US of A."
"She" is the subject of the sentence, "discretionary income" is the object.
Obviously we can't use "her."
"**Her** controls the majority of the discretionary income in the US of A."
Without giving a detailed explanation that may confuse you, the general rule is that the question can be reworded from "Who ___ ? " to "He/She _____ " or "By / to whom ____ ?" to " ____ he / her?"
Now let's see when it is appropriate to use "whom."
You could only use "whom" if the statement form is written in the passive voice instead of the active voice, and then you reword the passive voice statement (i.e. the answer) as a question.
Active voice: "**She** controls the majority of the discretionary income in the US of A."
Passive voice: "The majority of the discretionary income in the USA is controlled **by her**."
Reword the passive voice statement as a question:
"**By whom** do you think the majority of the discretionary income is the US of A **is controlled?**"

Every time someone plays Minecraft, their computer works as part of series of nodes forming a cluster that is actually Bitcoin mining. Some big cat hot shot is getting rich off the backs of the unsuspecting common folk.
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:43:29
I'm just trying to let everyone know that there's a conspiracy, and that they're actually somehow connected.

Because each Representative will have voting power equivalent to the % of bitcoins owned by people who choose to have that representative.
John, Bill, Kyle and Wabdulu could choose Sam to represent them.
Steve and Chris could choose Mike to represent them. 
But if Steve+Chris+Mike have more BTC, than Mike has a stronger voting power in the CONGRESS than Sam.

Notch and Satoshi agreed to a deal, Bitcoin and Minecraft will soon merge to form the world's largest conglomerate. People have been short selling it to cut their losses.
