Good analysis. Most likely reasonable.
But One thing to consider.
All existing analysis is based on historical knowledge.
Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are new thing. 
That makes me hesitate to trust this kind of analysis.
I hope Win-Win.
Good luck guys!

1. Lightning Network : now in action 
2. M.A.S.T:  it is new to me.
     Time line?
     What’s the difference between MimbleWimble and Rootstock?
   
3. Confidential Transaction :  very good.
    Time line?
Edit: I have changed from M.A.S.K to M.A.S.T
         Thanks!��

My address still starts with “1” not with “3”.
My understanding is it should start with “3”.
Am I wrong?

Good information!
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:25:39
Thanks for sharing good idea.

Thanks for summarization.
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:31:17
I agree to this guy.

Great article!
After reading,
1. We need to change our address to SEGWIT enabled
2. SCHNORRS SIGNATURES can go along with SEGWIT.
 —&gt; it can reduce transaction size and transaction fee
—&gt; It is good for anonimity because transactions are mixed. 
I think Government dors not like it.
3. There are several wasy of side chains which are using 2nd and 3rd layers to resolve the Transaction Throughput problem(high traffic)
  - Lighting network: it is happening
  - MimbleWimble: too much aggressive. Main concept is too aggressive. It may be implemented as a side chain similar to Lightning Network 
4. Smart contract :ROOTSTOCK 
 for Turing complete similar to Ethereum and completely compatible with Ethereum for smart contract and can be secured by existing Bitcoin mining network.

I have changed my wallet to use SEGWIT recently.

Lumino protocol based on Rootstock

Thanks much for sharing this.
If my understanding is correct, RSK is for smart contract very similar to Ethereum and even compatible with it.
Membership idea is pretty amazing.
I think it can accelerate the usage of bitcoin.
1. Bitcoin core needs hard fork or soft fork?
2. It looks RSK running now even it is not final brta stage.
 Why is it not so popular as Lightning Network?

I understand.
But think why you bought it.
If situation has changed, so your decision has lost its ground then sell all your coins and do not come back.
If everything is same or better than before, hold it.
In any case you are good to go.
I think bitcoin is like a baby.
We do not know who he will be.
If we support trust him, he will become stronger and he will get somewhere even we cannot imagine.
Cheer up and Good luck !
(I have bought it around $14,000 and I am keeping holding it)

What is going on with this?
It is brilliant!
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:32:03
This is true.
But it takes time.

I think this normal under credit based economy.
But the increaseing tendency  of debt is important.
If its increasing rate becoming fasfer, that is one of very important sign of crisis of currency system.
Do you have any recommendation to check this?
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:30:20
That  is why we are supposed to HODL.
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:29:36
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:21:11
Ouch, it hurts!
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:46:36
You mean “currency” instead of “money”?
These two are different.
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:09:49
I love it!
