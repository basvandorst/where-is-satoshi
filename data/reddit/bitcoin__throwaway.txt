Thank you. Check the post text for updates, but it looks like a similar situation has occurred with us.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:34:44
good point
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:00:19
I think you're right, it would have been just a general increase in cash flow through the account. CBA probably has an automatic flag for abnormal bank activity. WRT legitimacy, we followed the advice of CBA staff and branch management to ensure we were not breaking their policies.

As nerve wracking and confronting as this is, I've gotta admit it's a bit of a rush. I never could back down from a good fight...
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:17:26
correct, we are brokers. I use the term exchange loosely to indicate that we buy and sell.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:30:43
Yes I do. Given the murky nature of crypto tax law, even corporate litigators are still somewhat in the dark about these situations. The wisdom of the bitcoin crowd is an indispensable resource that a single lawyer couldn't deliver with the consideration can. Armed with the information in this thread I'll be much better able to approach the bank with a clear understanding of the situation, and likewise when I speak with my lawyer.
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:00:39
Yep, will do. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 23:52:04








No, we have a business account and have been openly discussing this with the bank.


They do allow bitcoin related business. I have a bitcoin related business and they allowed it. 
I'll follow up when we know what the problem is.
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:18:21
you're right. I'd forgotten how easily it is to be duped. I'll get my lawyer on board
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:52:33
It's probably best that this stays anonymous, thanks. If you think you might be able to help you can pm me. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:25:37
Great article, thanks for the information.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:49:30
Yeah at this stage it's entirely client funds that will be affected. We will make direct and immediate contact with them as soon as we have information about the process. Our capital is safe and should remain unaffected by the current freeze.
Thanks for sharing the story. I damn sure hope they aren't charging us interest on the $50k overdraft they enacted, like they probably did with your friends mortgage. That's downright rude.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:35:27
Yeah, I'll see the banks first thing tomorrow and then get the coinjar guys on the phone if I need some direction. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:46:29
Could you expand on the extent to which I'm liable? AFAIK we have no obligation to report transactions to AUSTRAC when dealing with crypto. This is something that we've been keeping our eye on. All we are doing is providing a means for clients to buy digital products. Is there any reason I'd be liable for a $10 purchase of computer software as opposed to a $10 order of btc, under the KYC terms?
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:40:22
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:19:19
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't KYC only apply to banking and financial services? That's probably why we're being investigated, but if we turn up clean, can we be held liable for damages or fraud from a customer, given that we are not bound by the same due diligence?
EDIT: I mean, if another party was using our service for money laundering, are we liable? The reason I suspect not is because we aren't bound to the KYC due diligence that financial services and banks are held to. Clarification would be appreciated.
@_date: 2014-04-09 04:26:37
Update: the account was frozen because fraudulent deposits were made into our account. A hold has been placed on one of the relevant pending transactions. The account should be unfrozen once I submit a statutory declaration that my business acted within our usual operating guidelines.
Another transaction was cleared and processed by our exchange, meaning that neither the money nor the bitcoin inventory is in our possession. The implications and liability for us are yet to be determined. At this stage we will be able to continue operating through CBA, upon approval of our stat dec, until further notice is given. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:27:26
No, we are not they. Though we've contact them to make sure they are running smoothly and to ensure they follow AUSTRAC regulations. We'll be keeping them informed of the outcome. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:36:22
Good call. We have enough capital in BTC to seamlessly roll over into NAB or similar while this hiccup is sorted out by CBA. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:31:37
Glad your friend got things sorted. How long is a while?
I'll make sure to let the community know how this pans out. Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:16:39
as the other commenter suggested, I'm using the term exchange loosely to encompass the buy and sell of bitcoin, and not the classic 'exchange' like cryptsy. This isn't to mislead anyone as this doesn't change the current circumstances, it simply helps with anonymity
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:04:19
I'm familiar with the video series, but always a good reminder. At this point there's no reason to presume guilt of any kind. I'm running a legitimate business in the trade of digital goods, and they've attempted to interrupt the operation of my business. I'd first like to know why, and how I can fix the problem. If they are interested in making things more difficult then I'll remember your wise words. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:21:51
Good advice, thank you
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:40:23
I'll try the 'softly softly' approach first I think; we'll try to demonstrate that we are on their side. If there are any illegal activities being inadvertently enabled by our platform then, we'd prefer to bring our operation up to their standards. It's just a little confusing *because we were being guided by their team*. If things don't pan out then yeah, maybe a stern letter will be in order. I'll even wag my finger vigorously. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 04:35:15
That's more or less what I've done, under the guidance of my lawyer. My business partner has significant contacts through NAB and Bank of Queensland. After speaking first with them, and then with our lawyer, we aided the bank in every way possible. They gave no indication that they were upset with our business model or closing our accounts because of the nature of our business.
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:57:17
Yep it's CBA. The thing is, I met most of the bank staff and regularly discussed my business with them. They would always ask how things were going and be genuinely curious about crypto. They gave me good advice on maintaining legitimacy and I kept everything above board. 
Luckily I was holding about 20btc so there won't be any interruption to ongoing services. Those individuals affected will be notified as soon as I have more info (it will only affect those who were currently making deposits). 
I'll make sure to get in touch with coinjar, thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:44:11
Yes, 2 transactions over $10,000aud. That might just explain it. Is that an automatic flag for AML/CTF, or just a 'flag for follow-up'? 
I have no interest in getting into an ideological debate with the bank; I'm a level-headed guy and just need to know that my funds and my clients funds are in good hands. If the result is we have to refund the money and suffer some reputation damage that comes with this investigation then so be it, we are clean, there's no shady activity taking place. 
To my advantage, I have in my family a corporate litigator/senior partner for a very large firm and a senior accountant for a 'big  4' accounting firm, from whom I've taken as much legal and tax advice as possible (which is limited because crypto is a grey area). 
If all that happens is a long winded, stern talking-to from the bank on *their own* ideological grounds then so be it. 
However, the people who deposit money with us require very minimal verification (as is the appeal of this kind of exchange). What might be the consequences if the investigation isn't about *us* but about *them*. Anything I need to consider?
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:54:42
That's definitely something I'm considering right now. What would happen to my business if those fraudulent funds had been dispersed to buy btc? Am I in any way liable for purchases I make with funds that were given to my exchange by fraudulent means?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:21:35
Thank you. I will keep this in mind, but I'm not a criminal in any way. I hope I never need to make that kind of decision. From the information here it seems like I am relatively safe, I just might be in a position where I'd prefer to chew my own arm off than deal with bank wank
