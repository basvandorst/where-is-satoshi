There are a few pros, but ultimately it wouldn't make that much of a difference. It's really personal preference at the end of the day.

Idk man, like I see what you're saying, but EOS isn't a pump and dump. I trust eos after a lot of research. The actual release will be a great thing in my opinion. I don't think it deserves a false pump.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:59:17
Yeah better safe then sorry - no sense messing up a thing that's decent.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:28:13
Yeah, I think it's really solid that they're doing that.
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:42:18
I honestly agree, Coinbase has been really solid for me!
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:52:35
Might take 2-4 days more, it would have been fast if you paid a little more for fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:42:40
You don't have to pay high amount of fees and the transactions are fast.

Damn man i feel for you. Id be crying right now if i were you

Panic-selling isn't a good thing, wait for the prices to go up then you can sell so you dont lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:22:21
do you still have any OMG IOTA or EOS? they are all honestly about to have huge rises if you have any folio left id consolidate.

I'm kinda happy that I was able to buy BTC at $12k yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:40:36
ill see you on the moon my friend!
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:33:06
Does he have some personal issues with Bitcoin or what?
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:20:08
Never ever listen to fake news on this subreddit and ignore people who advice you to sell your funds.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:48:32
Doesn't seem true, if it is then that man is a genius.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:17:38
I withdrew all of my bitcoins I had there after this incident and closed my coinbase account. I have lost my trust in them so there is no point using their services anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:32:41
Awesome present but you may need to fix that logo.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:33:14
"Ho, ho, hodl"
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:01:21
I'm never gonna lose my faith in Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:05:02
It's always food to get free info. Also good to do your own research though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:06:22
Completely agree!
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:31:06
Meh, btc is in a bit of a slump - but I guarantee it'll be back up by the summer time. That's when a bunch of alts are launching - it's gonna skyrocket the price of a bunch of currencies. BIG returns for people who stayed with their holds. Understandable though if you want to get out. Risky business.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:39:44
I agree, I absolutely love EOS. I look around at others, but your right. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:52
^^^ This guy gets it. EOS all the way.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:57:35
This man does his homework. EOS is a great example of how coins can be a huge impact. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:28:11
Bitcoin would be Tony Stark, unpredicted as hell.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:14:37
Hope you didn't share any private keys in "love"
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:22:08
You saw it in Law school? Makes me wanna visit the school now.
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:04:21
Nice collection of resources, they are pretty useful.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:56:12
Maybe this is the time we hit $9k again? Btw the market is going full green
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:23:04
They are getting crazy profits cause the market cap keeps going up and more people are jumping in from Korea as well.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:28:12
Already passing $8110+ which means it's still going on the bull run.
