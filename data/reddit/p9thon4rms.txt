Don't forget the $150 fee for incoming funds and $100 fee for outgoing funds that Kingdom Trust charges. That's $250 every time you want to move any funds in or out. If you are satisfied with the security of a hardware wallet (or whatever cold storage you prefer), then Broad Financial offers a better system that's cheaper, and allows instant trades at market prices unlike Bitcoin IRA which can literally take days to weeks.

Bonus: it won't let me cancel any old limit orders

You are the hero we deserve--been on here for months, and never knew until today what FUD meant.

I've spent the last three days trying to convert my remaining Kraken fiat (USD) to bitcoin so I can get it the hell out of there. Over the past three days I've made 20-30 attempts to place a market order and get an error message every time: "Your order may have failed. Please refresh the page and check your orders." or else that Cloudflare error screen. I'm skipping order confirmations. Not sure what else to do here--I guess I need to contact support so that I can place a friggin order?

Thanks for the tip--maybe I'll try it late tonight. I guess I don't need to explain that when an exchange can only handle transactions in the dead of night, it isn't very useful for a volatile asset like cryptocurrency.

Took 2-3 days for me last couple of weeks. If you’re trying to withdraw fiat, just convert to crypto &amp; send to a wallet

I just bought a notebook and sent payment from Coinbase.  I logged into CB &amp; paid by pasting the Baron Fig wallet address and amount, and Baron Fig verified receipt a few seconds later.  
Time spent was very comparable to digging a credit card out of my wallet &amp; punching in the numbers.

My friend texted me about this yesterday.  His message: "The CEO of Bitcoin committed suicide."  Um...

I want an ETF so I can invest Roth IRA funds in Bitcoin and the gains will be tax free. Unless anybody knows a way to do that now...

No. Ignoring Fact in favor of Theory is a recipe for disaster and tyranny.

Moving Bitcoin is cheap (like a hundredth of a percent or something). Buying and selling Bitcoin is more costly, since you pay the exchange a spread for the transaction.

For real? Is that already happening? Might have to use Kraken for trades instead.

Plus that inflated $1,200 figure was due to a liquidity problem as people tried to buy back their coins from a diminishing supply.

This is the correct answer. Buying Bitcoin is commodity/currency speculation--like buying gold, silver, or GBP--because it produces no income. The only gains are when it's value changes because someone is willing to pay more for it than you did.

Not to mention the fact that if you need to convert to/from fiat (as most people do), that $100M transfer is going to cost you a couple of million in fees/spreads at the exchanges
