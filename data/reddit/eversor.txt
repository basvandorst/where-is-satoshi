Namecheap is awesome and BTC transactions are processed quite fast and easily. Can't recommend them enough. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 09:51:18
Thank you good sir. Wasn't thinking such an impact (or a good idea) but might as well be.
@_date: 2014-07-31 10:25:28
So Coinbase is now Paypal?
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:37:22
How would they be doing that without anyone noticing? Like your wallet $ value not decreasing when BTC/USD goes down.

Dying to be able to go there when I visit the Netherlands again. Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:09:36
Good thing now there are alternatives, like bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. No need to be around USD that much anymore. I don't assume people have been using it because they like it, otherwise we wouldn't be here now.
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:14:01
That is up to the people.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:38:11
On page 27 they say that after distributing the 200k recovered BTC, they can't be moved for 1 year. I'm flabbergasted by the whole thing. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:16:30
I see. Tks.
@_date: 2014-03-20 03:36:15
Didn't know. Sorry about that, already fixed.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:07:42
I've found the growth of it very impressive and what seems a very friendly community, which is a huge incentive to be around. If people do actually manage to talk about more serious business, that is a huge plus for everyone, as I never got that impression from when I read it.
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:33:05
And who will keep the private key, private? Too much potential for scam.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:03:56
I don't recall everything that has been going on in Russia but wasn't Bitcoin used banned by the government?

As many times before, strange market movements occur at times. 
If one with so many bitcoins wanted to cash out, he would not cash it all at once. This way it means you sell for less than you otherwise would if you try to hide your sale in small chunks that match buyers and wouldn't provoke some panic that also lowers price further - you'd have to be kind of a retard to do this with more than $1M in BTC.
A sane person would also not choose BTC-E to sell the coins in a huge chunk (if they really needed to), as look at what happened to the price due to lack of market depth. If one wanted to cause some market shock, well, it's much better at that.
It may be some mining farm or manufacturer just wants fiat for parts, selling in a way that is very bad for them. Given the regularity of these events last week, that doesn't seem likely.
I don't dare make a prediction of price direction but looking at mining and market dynamics should give a starting point for those inclined to do that (and other) research.

Jeebus, this is forged. Go do it yourself, "changetip" doesn't even move 1 pixel from the Y-axis. Which you can also see because the guy didn't edit the blue bar on the left.

"People really really like drawing lines on a chart. Then they like to pretend it means something."
This sounds about right.
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:56:14
The M.T.G. Online eXchange has done more harm than good, hope they are gone forever.
It's mostly people's fault not taking their money out when they could, since spread has been huge for almost a year due to know problems withdrawing and general incompetence of the place. The only justification I can find for selling there was greed, which has come back to bite them.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:06:40
This comment would be an interesting post by itself. Previously, I had only heard good things from Bitpay.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:21:08
If people don't start to be realistic about this, a 30% loss may well become 100%. There's no point to BTC if pools have the power to double spend at will. It is beyond me why people don't get this.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:08:13
Well, for the buyer it's "whatever"? If you're not paying them, you can lower the price and then the customer is free to choose what fee he wants to pay, depending on how fast he needs the order placed. Seems like a better system to me than having fixed fees.
@_date: 2016-01-10 02:14:10
How? You let the free market (that was once bitcoin) to find the most efficient solution to this problem. What we can't have is an artificial limitation on the system's capacity stifle what can be done on an infrastructure level. This should not be a problem Bitcoin Core developers solve, because they can't. 
If China's Firewall is a problem, that is kind of their problem, not of the rest of the  world - they should be the ones finding solutions to *their* problem. If it's not feasible to mine there because of CGF, mining will move elsewhere - just like it went there because it was more economical to mine there.
@_date: 2014-07-31 11:51:07
Recently? I justed wanted to withdraw to make the switch. Will see if I can get more info on Changetip faqs or something. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:59:46
I'm guessing from all that's going on that Karpeles has screwed up and lost the keys. They would be insane to have that much on hot wallets after all the problems they had before.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:41:42
Sure, there is no point. The problem is that regardless of block size debates, mining is centralized due to economic incentives. A lot of people were expecting this to have taken a turn by now but it still hasn't happened, as transistors have kept shrinking on a reasonable pace.
With that in mind, one has to wonder (this discussion goes back years ago) if it is a good idea to have ASICs as the proof-of-work source.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:08:32
A free market *is* driven by people. What I'm saying is that by limiting block size, Core is limiting the number of solutions available to the current problem and testing doesn't occur with real world conditions - with real economic incentives. Also, if the number of users goes down due to inability to scale, mining will also slow down as demand for BTC stutters - as the network is less useful, it will become less secure.
Well, it seems some people don't think the current situation is acceptable, so some things will change in due time. I imagine it won't be long until the network there is a bigger issue than the costs of shipping the hardware to the US or elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-01-09 22:05:51
Bitcoin has now been hold hostage by China. It is probably more reasonable to just lift the limit and let miners decide if they want to generate bigger blocks or not. Let the real world show the kind of network delays it may introduce and how the infrastructure adapts to it.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:20:41
Precisely. China may as well force a fork in the not too distant future.
@_date: 2015-11-26 11:53:49
I didn't knew what they did before, or how this device would get you $110+ million in funding - I couldn't even find the specs for the ASIC chip on the site. So they're trying to make up for having millions in obsolete hardware by selling... overpriced obsolete hardware. Calling this shady is probably an understatement.
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:50:12
You do know that the base inflation was calculated based on those coins existing, don't you? Just making sure here.
@_date: 2015-11-26 08:38:03
I just don't see the point of having put a BTC mining hardware on the device. This makes it unnecessarily expensive and they could have just well have the CPU mine on testnet if you just want to test stuff out. Having an SD card to store stuff is also sure to cause lots of issues not very shortly after you start running a node on top of it.
For the budget they would do better to partner with someone and bring a case with an ARM SoC that has a SATA port and a small HDD, much like this: 
Then, if people want to mine, let them mine on the GPU or sell USB modules with ASICs.
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:24:32
If you're dealing with honest banks, this is not the true. If someone does try to charge hidden fees, it is usually because you are transferring *and* exchanging for another currency. You are free to unwind the transfer back and accept the sender's currency in a local, same currency account, for no extra charge.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:46:10
It goes without saying that you shouldn't buy stuff just because it is going up. 
One word of advice: know what you're buying into. In BTC's case, you should have looked at mining profit and confirmed price was a lot higher than mining costs(it still is @ 400), which doesn't  set a floor but gives a better idea of where the price can be. Also, when panic sells happen, the price of every asset usually goes below fair price.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:32:20
Wow... they can make ASIC chassis. Uh... I mean, laser etch them with a logo. Wow.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:08:37
Not many people would do this. Hope karma gets this back to you someday.
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:43:45
Why are you using a pool that takes 7.5%?
@_date: 2013-07-01 10:45:14
That is true and I did also do that when the price was very suppressed, pre block-halving. It depends on where the market is at a moment in time. Lots of long periods you could make quite the buck mining, so no need to invest a lot of money. Plus, you support the network and keep everyone honest.
@_date: 2013-09-14 11:15:56

+1 
If, as when Falkvinge first wrote about it, people start throwing money at bitcoin without looking at fundamentals, they will be throwing money at miners and creating a huge bubble, no doubt.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:41:48
Pictures or isn't true. Given your track record thus far, why should I trust that you are doing that?
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:23:06
Finally something interesting and worthwhile to read. Do keep us posted. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:30:29
You actually can do that if the laptop is well built. It is just that Apple tends to let temperatures on components go very high (80ºC+) for the sake of silence and some machines are just straight badly built. This stresses either the chips or lead-free solder, which tend tends to break down with time and thermal cycling.
Also, as with a desktop/workstation, you should keep an eye on dust gathering in heatsinks.
@_date: 2013-08-31 11:35:21
Compared to the rest of the investment world, the price increase when halving was priced in very, very late.
@_date: 2013-07-01 10:42:43
Yup. Around that time. If one wants bitcoin to succeed, we need to not think just in profit but keeping the network distributed. I have cheaper power 10h per day, at night. If that is what it takes, I'll just mine during that time to keep bitcoin as decentralized as possible. Obviously in the coming months that will mean to purchase ASICs also.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:51:36
Congrats on speaking out, because that really is what is need at this time.
From what I saw in the market, you seemed to be more under siege from high frequency trades than from a DDoS per se. Is this the case or not? Will you take measures to keep a sane market with lower frequency trades?
These days one could look at the data from your API and see huge spreads on trades, especially 0.01 trades compared to +20BTC trades - almost seems bots making small trades with each other to bring the quotes down. There doesn't seem to be any kind of price matching during these "chaotic" times. Is your exchange broken or what is going on there? 
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:14:09
Tks for posting this. Can't agree more.
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:26:36
This should have been obvious to anyone. Despite market valuation of bitcoin, the mining community is very small compared to the gaming community and industries that make use of GPGPU.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:09:37
One wishes one can!

Read about it in a post here on r/bitcoin and was looking into it. They ask you for BitStamp's *password* or API keys. Serious companies should never ask for your password, ever. If they're hacked, say goodbye to everything you have.

One of the cons is that the USB drive's files are certainly getting corrupted after little use. Unless you buy a cheap 30GB SSD in an USB case, be sure to do multiple backups of your wallet and do them every month. IIRC the client updates wallet.dat keys/addresses after a while, so a too old backup may be worthless.

Come on people... in the vein of the person who wrote the article: "this article is a piece of sh*t".
There may be facts in the post (or not) but this kind of reporting isn't worth anything.
