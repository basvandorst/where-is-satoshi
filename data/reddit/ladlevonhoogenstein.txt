great question, if you contact brown harris stevens (the real estate broker) im sure they will be more than glad to help you out, however they closed a deal in the past and sold it at listing price, and cashed out the BTC shortly after ($275k, 17.7 BTC at the time)

Premiums? i've only heard of buyers premiums in auctions.  If someone lists a home for $1,000,000 theyre not going to tell a prospective buyer 'Oh by the way theres a 20% premium" Thats unheard of, can you elaborate on what youre talking about? Im a realtor based in Miami servicing south and central florida.

I think im just confused with his use of the word 'premium', i wouldnt consider paying above listing price (which very rarely happens with listings such as this one) a premium. Also keep in mind that the buyer would have to make the difference up in cash (or BTC in this case, lol) an offer above the listing price is great but a loan will only cover the appraised value

as you can see, this beautiful home is for sale in Miami, which is why i am answering the original question with references to my "shit hole state". 
Youre talking about homes in Seattle being sold on average for about $5,000 above their listing price (this is actual public data that you can see for yourself). Not exactly something anyone is worried about when buying a $3m home lol.
edit: check out the home here :)

Thats not what hes asking. Hes asking if there is a premium when you use Bitcoin instead of USD and i assume he means using btc as a korean citizen in the US, when people in Korea cash out crypto they pay 20%(?) or more ive heard in premiums.
lets say an offer of $3.1m is accepted would they take $3.1m in BTC or would he have to pay premium on top of that, and in his case im sure his countries laws may come into play

Has Jed McCaleb ever been suspected as the "hacker" at any point during this case?
