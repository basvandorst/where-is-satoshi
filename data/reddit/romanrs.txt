Igot has had every sign of trouble for at least a year if not more. Reddit has seen a fair share of complaints about them and I know many people including myself who would not be surprised by this at all. 
There are much better exchanges in Australia with great reputation who are doing the right thing. [Do your research.](
What sucks is that Bitcoin is yet again in the news for the wrong reasons.

Way too many people have been having issues with iGot. When they claim to have **100+ banks** on their website, it's hard to believe how having one bank account frozen can disrupt them from sending out pending withdrawals.
I really hope they are not iGoxing and have not been burned by FX and actually hold less cash than on the books. It could have easily happened if they don't balance their accounts between different currencies and the FX rate moves against them. AUD did gain over USD recently.

Also the front screen: [
Yes this is a Robocoin ATM. Using the machine first time to buy bitcoins, you will need to verify your phone number, verify your ID/drivers license against your photo, do a palm scan. This process takes about 5 minutes.

Can't (At least when I tried). You have to have US address and US credit card.

That's really great news for the community. And a great move by Microsoft. This makes an impressive list of best known global companies to accept bitcoin:
* Dell
* Microsoft
* Wikipedia
* PayPal

I could help out, PM me if you would like me to.

It depends what you are after:
* IndependentReserve.com - New guys on the block, doing it properly. My new preferred choice. And Adam is all over Reddit it seems, they were on ABC news too.
* getbitcoin.com.au - Used them few times, fast, anonymous, but expensive (GST) and may seem shady, but I've never had a problem.
* coinjar - too expensive, slow, had some issues with deposits.
* local Bitcoins - why would you use them when you have other cheaper  safer options.
* BTCMarkets - haha, I can write an exchange too! Just waiting for them to get hacked.
* iGot: Don't use them, same as BTCMarkets, the kids will get hacked, just a matter of time. Also they blatantly lie on their website. They claim to have 13000 BTC volume in 24 hours. This is totally made up, bitstamp does just over that volume and has 11% global market.
Price wise check this out:  IndependentReserve.com.au is best value for money at the moment. 
Hope this helps.

Dude you are awesome! Merry Christmas to you. Can we call you BitSanta?

CoinMap for instance lists almost twice as many bitcoin businesses in Melbourne as in Sydney. So I guess "Sydney has not had as much development in bitcoin space as Melbourne" would be somewhat justified by that.

I signed up to Independent Reserve yesterday, was painless and all the verification was done straight away - massive plus!
Did a BPAY deposit in the morning, got an email from them that my account was credited in the afternoon - massive massive plus!!! 
Bitcoin deposit was also as you expect, painless and took standard 1 hour for 6 confirmations. 
Did few small trades both market orders and limit orders, works well. Like the interface and design. 
I'll try out the API and report back, but so far I am very impressed. Thumbs up.

I am a big fan of bitcoin and see huge potential for it in Australia (Having one of the largest smart phone penetrations in the world, we are well geared for it). 
Sydney has not had as much development in bitcoin space as Melbourne, but I am glad and excited to see quality bitcoin services poping up in Sydney.

NCR is used in most supermarkets in Australia for self-checkout. I live in Sydney, Kings Cross, a hot spot for backpackers. The local supermarket (coles) is always overflowing with them buying sunscreen, cheap bread and beer. I feel so sorry for them paying  exorbitant credit card fees at the checkout. Bitcoin would be fantastic on NCR terminals here :)

By the way I am not associated in any way with the company that does the roll out of the ATMs or Robocoin. Just interested in Bitcoin and happen to live in the city.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:08:01
I guess a lot of people are trying to buy bitcoin, certainly if is anything to go by, there are a lot more people interested in investing/buying bitcoin than selling. So market makers have to come into play here.
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:18:47
"...has seen more than 1000 users subscribe to the platform"
This is good news, shows some uptake in Bitcoin in Australia.
"People were willing to pay as much as 40 per cent above market rates..."
I guess this just shows how inaccessible Bitcoin is/was for Aussie buyers. I hope startups and new exchanges like this would help fix the situation.

Use an exchange, they take on the responsibility to deal with AML and fraud. When you sell your bitcoins, your counter party must have funds in exchange's trust account.

Westfield on the mall in the city. This is the food court under myer.

It's fantastic that you pitched in to the thread. It's also great Walmart considered bitcoin. Few points if you don't mind: 
1. I also know one company who thought about accepting bitcoin, but ultimately for similar reasons you described are not doing it "right now". Interesting what would happen if few companies who are in this position would say: 'What the heck, lets be leaders" and started to accept and promote bitcoin. Very soon they themselves will create an environment where accepting bitcoin is advantageous and ultimately will benefit because they were early in that space. 
2. I am sure there are actually hundreds of employees in Walmart who would love to be paid in bitcoin, at least partially. Eg: the techies in your technology devision?
3. From the point of finding funding and building/developing the software and tech for Walmart to accept bitcoin, this would be even more interesting. Imagine what kind of VC backing a startup would get if they had a LOI from Walmart saying that they are to work closely with Walmart to build a system that would integrate with your accounting, payment and pos systems to accept bitcoin. Marc Andreessen would salivate over something like that. 
That's my 2c. 
Every problem is actually an opportunity in disguise.

What "3 businesses" in lton accept bitcoin?

With 612 mb of ram, I am not sure if bandwidth is going to be the first problem. I was being somewhat sarcastic.
This did make me wonder just how much bandwidth qt goes through a month. Any ideas?
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:25:35
Everyone go and get a free micro EC2 instance on amazon and install a qt client on it.
Damn you need a credit card, I knew I shouldn't have cut mine up in favour of bitcoins.

I'v used, I think all the exchanges in Au. 
IR is the only one I'v been running a bot against. 
I don't have much cash to play with, but IR has been great to make me few $$. Also the guys have been all over the media (eg ABC news), which, call me a sucker, makes me trust them more. 
I'v been a great advocate of Bitcoin in Au and IR seem to have done it all properly. Also the Bitcoin ATM in Westfield and BitPos guys who are yet to come through with projects in Tasmania etc, are a great asset, but with the GST thing are out now. 
I have withdrawn cash and Bitcoin from IR and used them a bit. They are good. Previously I used CoinJar, but honestly, I can't see them competing. 
I am yet to write my review on using IR's API. But so far so good. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:58:39
Do some research, see who is better value for money and who charges less in trade fees. Igot is ok good price wise, about the same as IndependentReserve, but IndependentReserve have lower trade fees. BTCMarket is not as good value for money though. CoinJar are just out of the game now.

Already had full blockchain. 13 GB was upload from the vm. Download was only ~950 MB

Even if MtGox sorts this mess out and allows withdrawals (if they are smart it would be limited or throttled transfers out, because otherwise they will go down overnight as everyone will withdraw coins and cash). Regardless, this will lead to everyone transferring what is left out of MtGox slowly or otherwise as allowed. This will inevitably drive MtGox down to either insolvency or close to it. 
Obviously MtGox have internally talked about this and must realise that they have no chance in hell of making out of this alive. For them the decision is a choice between: Screw a lot of people over, take what they can, shut down hard and hope for the best when angry customers go after them (with lawsuits or guns); or let their customers take what's left and allow withdrawals, and be bled to death by their own customers, and when there is nothing left, shut down.

* The VM is Standard A2 - 2 cores, 3.5GB ram in South East Asia (Singapore).
* The Bitcoin-QT client had up-to-date blockchain, I left it for 24 hours exclusively running the client. 
* The blockchain is located on the "Temp" drive on the VM.
* Total downloaded from the network was 953.41 MB
* Total **sent to the bitcoin network in 24 hours was 13.77 GB**

I've used most if not all exchanges (and otherwise merchants) in Australia. Independent Reserve is the only one I've never had any issues with. They do Poli as well which is instant.
