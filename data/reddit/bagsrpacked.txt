I agree with you and it sort of boggles my mind sometimes.  It seems like cryptos are blowing wide open, but if you ask the avg person they have almost no info other than they recognize the word bitcoin.  Zero interest in investing and many are quick to tell you it's a scam or a fad. 
If you are not old enough to remember - I think this might be 1995 all over again.  Back then I would have these same conversations with people about the internet.  I would excitedly ask them if they are on it, but most had barely heard of it or had no interest in learning about it, or it would confuse the fuck out of them.  5 years later the whole world was using it. 
History is repeating itself.  I think this space may do the same thing.  Crazy growth for 5 years and then pivot, just like how the internet pivoted with social media when the growth stalled, and then it was another round of crazy growth but with social media.  This is internet 3.0 
OK, if this seriously happens exactly this - then I will let go of my hesitations and surrender to the belief that we are indeed living in a simulation.

Thanks for the clarification on stocks not being eligible for like kind exchange.  So much to learn...

I agree, I think it should be treated as a Like-Kind exchange like they do in stocks.  But the IRS is saying any transaction, even a trade of one crypto for another is a taxable event?? At least that is how I am interpreting their guidelines. Look at Question   
[IRS guidelines for paying taxes on digital currency](

*First They Ignore You, Then They Laugh at You, THEN THEY FIGHT YOU, Then You Win*
Wow - mind blown.  This is **exactly** what is happening, I love it.  
Someone should create an Orville Redenbacher coin because I think 2018 is gonna be a popcorn sort of year.  Bullish!

They have huge oil reserves.  How could they let their country get this way.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:38:39
I didn't realize that was the case.  Makes a little more sense now, thanks.

I would not be surprised if other giants like amazon are looking into this.  Ebay is slowly dying so I can see them trying it.

This.  LOL

What a great doc thanks!  I am working on an app for newbies to manage their crypto portfolios and will link to this as a beginners guide.  Thanks!

Its not a waste.  Once you have purchased some you now have some skin in the game.  It changes everything.

Overstock did this and their stock popped and they got lots of free media buzz.  They might be trying to do the same thing.

everything was on sale, great time to buy

In 1,000 years you will merge with the machine and become one with bitcoin.  Thats pure fiction.
In truth it will more likely happen in 50-100 years.

Interesting article – thank you.    It seems to touch on 4 areas and I wanted to give some comments.
**Nature of money**
I like the cash/cache comparison.  The English language has a number of these “odd” coincidences.  I had not seen that one.  I think money is just a way of this world.  My thought is you have to play the game while you are here.  Be in the world but not of it.  
**Energy requirements, population and environmental concerns**  
You make good points about the energy consumption needed and the cost to our environment.  It does assume we continue with our current energy production methods though.   I think advances in this space are being purposely suppressed to continue profits.  This will eventually change and energy will become easier to produce.  The problem with bitcoin / cryptocoins and computation problems will solve itself.  The same way oil did. When oil became scarce enough they invented ways to pull oil out of tar sands.  Necessity is the mother of invention.  
**Technological advancement**
Completely agree here.  We have advanced so rapidly in the last 30 years but we have not progressed spiritually enough to have the wisdom to handle the technology.   It’s like an 18 yr old with a loaded gun.  Technically he/she is an adult and has the right to own the gun but does he/she have the wisdom and maturity for it?  To be honest I think we have been here before, wrecked ourselves, and now were doing it again.   Lots of clues point to this.  It’s our pattern.   This point is more in line with the environmental concerns.  We are not mature enough as a species to want to preserve our habitat.  We are like teen agers who want it all now and think we will live forever.
*What is bitcoin, really? You can think of it as a machine contagion—a network of devices amped to their performance tolerances—machines that do nothing but reprocess every transaction that ever occurred on their network (thus achieving ‘consensus’) while, at the same time, ‘mining’ new blocks of coins (currently worth about 25 btc) by solving a purposefully cumbersome mathematical formula which doesn’t actually accomplish anything other than enforcing computational difficulty. That is: making millions of machines grind away madly at nothing.*
Very interesting, I like it.

I dunno, seems sketchy.   China has huge infrastructure dedicated to cryptos and they are saying that less than financially literate Japanese men using borrowed money are "dominating" trading?  meh...

Sorry, I dont understand.  
Can someone dumb this down for me?  ELI5...

Keep a record of your purchase price and sale price if you do sell.  Your country tax authorities may come after you for their cut at some point in the future.  
Good idea to keep track of your transactions.
