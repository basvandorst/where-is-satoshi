Value drops as it's spend because people are selling them immediately for USD.

Meaningless sentence, you can't "revolutionize" a market cap since that doesn't mean anything.


THERE IS BITCOIN GENERATED EVERY DAY. The fucking "market cap" ( which is showing how you treat bitcoin, because NO-ONE TALKS ABOUT CURRENCY HAVING A MARKET CAP, it's called circulation) can increase while the price(in USD/ currency basket) of one can stay stable.

You're the one calling circulation "market cap".

Hey, a some-what sane response for me ones.
But I severely disagree that value will rise as usage increases, and that the current correlation is not a causation, which is what this all boils down to.

This isn't even a scam.
This is a tax on stupid people.

Success as a currency means stability/ usage, which doesn't need to increase the price because there is still being currency generated.
NOBODY will take a currency under serious consideration of usage until the value is stable, and all those websites( more like the bitcoin processors) that are accepting it are selling the bitcoin immidiately thereby decreasing the price if it's not made even with the same amount or more bought at the same time. 
There is a reason nobody lists prices of things in bitcoin yet, because you'd have to check what a bitcoin is worth everyday/ hour( except exchanges which exchange coins for other coins... which is strange and meaningless anyway).

Wow, an early investor saying stuff that strokes the bitcoin cock? Wow, I'm sure he really has no bias and this is 100% true.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:20:08
If you want bitcoin to succeed as a currency... use it as a currency, not an investment/ tool to get USD.

Stop it, spreadshit.
Noboby fucking cares about your shitty website.
Stop trying to make this go viral.
Edit: misspelled spreadshirt, decided to keep it that way.
