It's very sobering reading stuff like this. Imagine having to rely on Bitcoin to sustain your *life*

Thank you kind stranger.
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:57:41
Sure, but you fail to realize the main difference. In Bitcoin, there's no overarching "WE" who can flag anything.

I'll ask again, like 'samjhill', I wonder why the fee is $0.1 on the LN... it seems quite high.
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:35:09
To all who are torn on this matter: All Altcoins (like NEM) can put out a tweet saying that "we" will do such and such to mitigate an 'undesirable/unpopular' transaction, wheras within the Bitcoin ecosystem it would be a laughable matter!

Venezuela is gonna be ground zero for the real-life Bitcoin revolution.

You sir, have a beard.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:46:23
Very much agreed! Although a lot of BTC will inevitably be lost when tinkering with Lightning Network at this beta stage, it will contribute to its mainstream deployment much quicker, I hope.

Even if the Bitcoin blockchain is not "anonymous" in that sense, it IS completely indiscriminate to whatever happens within its set of rules.
You, as a human being, don't exist in blockchain's view. Only private and public keys do, and that's all the rule.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:46:54
I don't care about anyone else, this is what I'm calling it from now on. Brilliant. Long live 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:03:02
The fact that there's even a central authority that can decide what to do with the NEM blockchain goes to prove that it is just another shitcoin. Bitcoin is the only true, neutral entity

China is banning Bitcoin again, this is newsworthy.

Thanks for sharing this.
Your post made me imagine the pain and frustration of going through a loss such as this. 
I just want to thank you for offering your story and be sure that the awareness raised might save a lot of similar pain.
All good things to you mate

If a nationstate wants to destroy your little financial experiment along with your holdings - they can do it with any coin but Bitcoin.

Satoshi does not get to decide what Bitcoin (BTC) is supposed to be. I love his invention - it's probably the most important and most exciting thing to happen in my lifetime - but the whole point of it is that no one gets to decide what it is

This guy gets it.
The price of Bitcoin = The amount of real value the asset is trusted to hold because of the reward structure. Incredibly fundamental.

1) Hacker steals $30 million in Tether
2) Sends it to an exchange address
3) Trades it for real cryptocurrency
4) Withdraws, tumbles, back to BTC in the end.
Well done.

Imagine the wealth Venezuelans could potentially hold if they become early adopters of Bitcoin, whilst also having the largest oil reserves in the world.
Just need to get rid of the government.

Dude, GalacticCannibalism.. thank you for posting this clip. This sort of material makes the general Bitcoin-consciousness more aware that Bitcoin does NOT have official representatives, and no public statements like this should be taken with any sort of weight.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:09:29
This is the biggest threat to Bitcoin so far. If this thing "goes away", Bitcoin has proven to be a $100 Billion secure system.

Why are you hitting yourself in the face?
Read the title, I said it is possible it will be a selling event because people have been piling into Bitcoin as of late to get the free coins from the fork. Not that "I think it's a brilliant time to sell".

Gentlemen, this means B2X is dead. Good days are ahead for Bitcoin, and Coinbase has restored the confidence in its customers.
