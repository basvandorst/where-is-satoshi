My understanding is from the purchaser(s) of your Bitcoin when you sold (exchanged) for USD.

Why is this downvoted

Hold long term. People that bought 3 years ago at the all time high of $1000 would have thought they lost bigly until about recently. Today they would quadruple their money.

Proof there's no such thing as an original thought. It's the first thing I thought of when the price broke $3000, and I thought about the near future.

It's all propaganda and manipulation. The MSM uses it against anything that threatens their narrative and control, including but not limited to our current president and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is powerful enough to defeat the censors. Just like the printing press did.

As an end-user (non-miner) do I need to do anything? Update a client?

I'm in the same boat as you. It has been pending a few hours but fortunately it is a small amount.

$500k BTC with max supply of 21,000,000 is $10.5T

Get a receipt printer that generates a code and QR code, and you've got yourself a winner.

Too true. The further downstream you are from the source, the more likely there is going to be some contamination in the water.

I don't think any outcome of this is going to be good.  The Federal Reserve is the child of the same robber baron family that profited from both sides of the war in Waterloo, and continues its use of fiat today to basically own nations. "I care not who makes a nations laws as long as I control it's money."  They started out by ignoring Bitcoin because it was small, and frankly not worth their trouble.  It still isn't big enough to be worth their trouble *at this point*.  But Bitcoin's growth and adoption rate could make it a serious competitor to the Fed's monopoly on control one day.  This meeting will provide them with some information pertaining to whether or not Bitcoin can be reined in.  If it can, it will be regulated to death until any white-market use isn't viable.  This will drive the price down and make it only useful for black-market purposes.  If it can't be controlled, it will be destroyed by covert means.  Never underestimate what extremely powerful men with an endless supply of money can do when their power is threatened in the slightest.

I recommend reading "The Creature From Jekyll Island" to expand your understanding of how the Federal Reserve works.
