haha, yeah i know that :)
I said its his fault, i told him we need a better balancer and should cloudflaire our websites, but he said we never had problems with this one and doesn't want to share space. So yeah i hardly get into situations where i did a failure.
Also i live in a place where i can be a bit cocky to my boss without having the fear to be fired from one moment to another.

Ever heared of the mash network?
Mesh network will be the thing after big companies will make the internet useless or a catastrophy will make break important backbones of the current internet system or whatever.
Mesh is cheap, not that fast, sustainable as fuck and pretty impossible to shut down.

Man, Holland is so from the future.  
  
They have good hookers law, supporting woman who want/need to do that and at the same time they make sure they can go to the police if they have problems and also make sure the customers do not have to put theyr wieners into ones that might have diseases.  
  
They have good herbz law so that you can buy it if you want it, with lots of taxes and quality management. People are sure to buy what is written on the tag and can go to the police if something is wrong. People does not have to go to shady placeses to buy overpriced stuff with bad quality and youg fellas certenly do not have that shady contact who might want to sell them something else.  
  
And they support BTC which everybody nows here is a step necessary to free us from some really bad policies on a lot of stuff. Money whices goes to Goverments will be traceable and so on and so on.

Never ever where private investors the more important creditors. 
I mean in some states it regulated by law that not even the working stuff is as important as big creditors (for as example a company going bankrupt). 
I mean in some states it regulated by law that the folk is not as important as big creditors (you know, your taxes used to save banks/corporations and on the other side they scream free market).
Do you have a lawyer pissing mtgox on the back every day on the week? Well than don't even bother thinking about getting some coins back.
But yeah, who am i telling that? You made a failure in first place by trusting mtgox. I'm sorry for your loss, and i dont intent do piss you off, but wake the fuck up man or if you're a kid, grow up!
