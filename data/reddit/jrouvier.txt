You can't tell me what I can and can't upvote.

I tried this last night, here was my experience:
* Looks good, I'll try $10, which should give me about 0.05 btc.  Out comes the credit card.
* Hey, my $10 deposit is now only $9.16?  Oh, they charge $0.49 + 3.5% for incoming deposits.  Fine, whatever, I could probably make up the difference by looking under the couch cushions.
* Ok, let's first convert my USD to SLL.  What? I can only convert whole dollar amounts?  So I can convert $9 and $0.16 will be uselessly left in my account?  &lt;sigh&gt;, ok, well at least now I'm out a nice round dollar.
* Oh, you are also going to take a 5.6% commission on converting USD to SLL?  Well, you already have my money, I might as well do something with it.
* Great, now I have SLL, let's convert that to btc.  What? the minimum exchange is 0.10 btc?  Well, shit.
* OK, fine, you already have $10 of mine, and if I do nothing you just get to keep it.  I'll just give you $20 more so I can get some damn btc tonight.
* In goes an additional $20, which becomes $18.81 after fees.  Again, I can only convert whole dollars to SLL, so now $0.97 is left in my account
* Fine, now I can convert to SLL to BTC and be done.  Oh, really?  I can only convert to BTC in units of 0.01?  So the change will be left as SLL?  Bloody hell.
* Oh, and you are going to take a commission on this too?  I should have guessed.  Now my $30 has become 0.11 btc?  Fine, let's just get this done.
* Enter my wallet address, click submit and get the message  **Your withdrawal request has been received. However, a manual step is required before it can be completed. More information can be found *here***, with "here" being a faq link that says they will probably continue processing after 48 hours.
tl;dr: Spent $30 for 0.11 btc (50% markup), yet they may or may not actually deliver the btc in a couple days.

I'm not saying they shouldn't, and I don't blame them.  But it doesn't fulfill my original question:

Looks like they put a 60-day hold on money coming in from Paypal

You have been a redditor for 14 minutes and your url ( makes me suspicious.

Requires miiCard, which wants me to give them the username and password to my bank.
