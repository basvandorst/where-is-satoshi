1. Check the blockchain. Are the funds there?
2. Take posession of the device and immediately move the funds off it.
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:17:15
Personally, I've used them the same way because I believe they are solid and safe. BUT like the person says below.. there is no backup, you need to tamper/open the device to check if funds are moveable. I definitely use them the same way you mentioned above though. Small amounts.
@_date: 2019-07-04 02:45:20
Because the World Bank/IMF and the UN will declare it a human right.. as has been always planned. And a world exchange program, sovereign 4 crypto will be introduced to accelerate one world currency adoption. One world governance.

It's meant to work like physical money. Not long term storage. AWESOME product. 2 guys, smart as hell, been working with btc very early on.

I'm talking about the actual Worldbank.  It can be Bitcoin. It can be a derivative of Bitcoin. It can be in part bitcoin. Like an SDR with bitcoin. Fiat money is worthless and always has been. The same way a store's "coupon dollars" are. The wealthiest people in the world dont collect fiat dollars. A world currency is about logistics and efficiency of control. It's not about making the true owners of the economy "richer". Any way you look at it.. fiat is going away. The people with crypto now and after will never replace the people who made it all happen. Which is the people behind the Worldbank, the IMF, DARPA and the NSA.

Deterministic GUID hydrated with biometric info, face/retina/hand/finger . That is the number of (each) man. Crypto wallets will be explicitly tied to your number. There may be a black market in the future but for most people, operating in that market will be impossible. No one will buy or sell without it - government approved wallets tied to your number. When the Worldbank starts the implosion of fiat money the UN will declare crypto the money of the world and a human right. The Worldbank will setup an amnesty exchange program from all fiat to a crypto (maybe btc maybe a new one). This program and the UNs promotion of crypto as a right will trigger the final collapse as people around the world rush to exchange their country's worthless money to the world currency.

The only way to decouple the manipulated paper price from the actual value is to create a live audit.

There is a very strong base of people holding that truly will never sell. They've been through the panic, the hysteria, the ridicule, the misunderstandings of nocoiners.  When these crashes happen it's almost like coming home and partying with old friends. 300 memes flowing. Angry and frustrated haters screaming how and why. Telling us what to think and feel. Warning us that our smiles WILL one day disappear. Even as the price plummets and we cheer. I've been at this since 2012 and it's still entertaining as hell. Haven't bought or sold anything since 2016. No reason to sell. I will use my crypto to buy things when those things use lightening network and are cheap as hell.

Retailers hate credit cards. 3% ++ fees on top of regular banking and related fees. In some cases the merchant provider will hold funds up to a month. Ask your local retailer how they like their merchant provider. This is why you get small shops embracing bitcoin even though it sucks balls (without LN) as a payment solution. Retailers hate merchant providers and credit card companies. Do you like paying 2 dollar fee for purchases under 5 bucks? Most small retailers have to charge this because it's otherwise an unprofitable exchange.

While they may not be out in the streets of Stockholm attacking innocent people they certainly aren't paying respect to the complacency and ignorance of a system that barely accepts them.

When you indirectly pay for tariffs you are supporting a positive investment. Unlike eternal debt for fake wars and bailouts. In business dealings you need to focus on leverage when directing the outcome. Mexico, and ultimately the companies that want and need to operate in the US have less leverage than a government that is working towards long term gain for itself and the people. If Obama's decisions created any momentum for any long term economic gain then how can what Trump has done in 2 years be so destructive? If you remove military dominance from the equation the US has been irreparably bankrupt for at least 10 years. If the goal is to have a prosperous and sovereign America then using leverage to make growth based investments is the only thing that can be done. If the goal is to wallow in the terrible wrongs that have been done in your name (fake wars, violent domination) and fall on the sword then keep borrowing until bankruptcy and total destruction of America. Trump is a crook. No doubt. But his marketing plan is the winner because it's based on sound premises.

Your home is a microcosm of a state. Do you have conflict in your home sometimes? Does that mean your home is facist? Do you accumulate and hold resource in your home? Do you have a door to lock? Walls? States are a manifestation of humanity. Humanity is made up of groups of people and then individuals. Declaring all states as evil or authoritarian is ignorant and immature. No one will completely open themselves, their families, their friends, up to hardship for the comfort of strangers who they don't know as good or bad.

Do you understand how fundamentally more severe the Great Depression was compared to 08? And that was almost a century ago. There was also a 47% crash in 1919. 10 years before black Tuesday.
