Fyi, am a big supporter of bitcoin, I’m not whining just a question I had in mind - that’s price manipulation though isn’t it? The point would be for the billionaire to make a quick buck and fuck over the others?

That was exactly my question dude,  A billionaire could buy x bitcoins and manipulate the price of bitcoin for it to increase and then dump them all at once in the market.  How does bitcoin prevent this?

What I don't understand is how will solving these mathematical algorithms magically give you bitcoin?

over the years, I feel like people are in it for the money rather than the technology or adoption. so I want to know your perspective (people who are genuinely in it for change) why should a fiat currency be scrapped?

Here's the thing though, [here]( I asked another question in a thread regarding bitcoin being unregulated and I still feel like the elite could still control bitcoin even when it's unregulated as mentioned in the thread. A billionaire could buy x bitcoins and manipulate the price of bitcoin for it to increase and then dump them all at once in the market. It's a huge problem in cheap alternative cryptocurrencies too.
I feel like the technology is just not there yet. The astronomical fees, speed and overall the concept of bitcoin, I don't think it's ready to be a BETTER alternative than traditional FIAT currencies. I also genuinely believe a very good percentage of people interested in bitcoin are in it solely for the money. 
Bitcoin may be the start of something revolutionary but right now, there's no good reason BTC can be adopted worldwide. Credit cards can process thousands of transactions a second, free of fees and even if bitcoin is not regulated it can be controlled by pump and dump schemes. In all honesty, I just don't see it in many ways.

the amount of bitcoins you hold doesn't necessarily mean that's = your net worth lol.
