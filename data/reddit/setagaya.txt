The US government is a debt-ridden, imperialistic war machine that doesn't even notice an extra $2 billion in its bank account. You think they just say "Hey, we made $2 billion on bitcoin, let's sell it and help some poor people!"? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:25:38
Huh? Man, any "exchange" of bitcoin is a taxable event, whether you trade it for dogecoin or a 1998 Dodge. This is common knowledge. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:30:48
As far as the IRS is concerned YES THEY ARE. If you think they're going to let you make profits in BTC, and then just spend your way out of them you're living in a dangerous delusion. It's simply not true that they only care about fiat trades. It's probably all they can manage dealing with at the moment, but you can't just go and buy a house and expect to be able to say "Hey, I didn't make any real profit, all I got was this house!".
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:54:42
that's....not true at all.

The hitman charge is bullshit, and what he built was beautiful. He's also responsible for bitcoin being where it is today, so don't forget where we came from. I was here in 2012 when the Silk Road illustrated exactly what could be done with a free, community-regulated marketplace that couldn't be censored. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:58:17
You think the government knows how to use money better than private interests? Or that "the public" gets some kind of cut of the proceeds? Hell, I'd still rather private sector criminals had the loot than the public sector ones. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:03:31
Large transactions are generally OTC. Only a moron would just dump a fuck-ton of coins like that at once. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:22:03
Exactly. They used the alleged hitman incident to hammer him with, yet they didn't even have enough evidence to charge him with it. Total bullshit.

Well, for starters, it shouldn’t take several hours and $15 to buy a pack of gum. Not sure what money is, but I know it isn’t that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:08:17
None of those gains are guaranteed at all. Additionally, because it’s regular income, it also means that your salary will also be lumped in with it and your health insurance costs will go up as well since they’re linked to salary. 
For a regular person, the tax risk is substantial, 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:56:57
Yeah but in most places crypto isn’t income, it’s taxed on the return as capital gains. Capital gains in japan is 20%
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:55:04
US is 20% because bitcoin is taxed as capital gains. Japan is treating it as regular income, which means it’s not being seen as gains on an investment. This is actually a massive distinction  
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:20:52
Lol. If you NEVER spend or exchange them, sure why not, but these taxes apply to basically any use of crypto, leaving zero reason to ever own them. Even buying a cup of coffee is a taxable event in Japan. Your logic will backfire because people with real money actually do look at such things. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:35:13
Your tax consultant is correct, though mine said it can go up to 55% at the highest levels. Additionally, because this is a new ruling any change made to reduce rates wouldn't apply until April 2019, making the next 1.5 years shitty for all of us. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:22:31
Supposed to according to whom?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:59:32
What would happen with forex or stock investment returns in japan would normally be 20% capital gains, not 45%, so this isn’t what would normally happen at all.

I met this guy at the meetup. Gotta say his story is a bit overblown, and he's just in it for the publicity judging by his attitude. Re: "regulatory spotlight" all exchanges and Bitcoin businesses are. That means that they're trying to be careful and abide by the law. Hardly incriminating or new information. 
Look, I empathize, but this is a totally new field and full of risk. If you think Gox doesn't have the coins (they undoubtedly have a heap just in their own stock) you're delusional.

I still think Paypal can technically be a currency in that you're transmitting "paypal dollars" which you go in and out of from USD. this is splitting hairs, but it's just a matter of definitions...am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:28:46
Your local bank probably goes down for several hours many times a week to do maintenance because it's a LOCAL bank and their customers are asleep. Gox's customers not only never sleep apparently, but they're all around the world 24 hours a day.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:27:03
They aren't "stopping" withdrawals. Let's not go overboard. Do you honestly think they don't have the BTC to cover it? They've been in this a long time and surely have loads of non-customer BTC. It's good they're stopping to fix something, even if it's annoying.
@_date: 2014-03-22 08:03:27
Yeah, you're right! Let them just crash and burn, taking al equity with them, and then no one gets anything. That'll show 'em.
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:45:45
Share price has little to do with the price of XCP. If anything, the utility of the shares is higher when bitcoin is cheaper, because then transactions cost less to write to the blockchain. He's just using an XCP token to represent his shares.

Oh, the ones they had to step back from after it was clear that THEY were the ones who were wrong? Good luck on your publicity tour of MtGox. I'll pop by to take a picture of you freezing your ass off.

oh, that vague statement that explained exactly what the problem is in detailed technical language? Makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:49:12
Gox doesn't operated in a "free market". Their problems were instigated from the beginning by governments and banks using their power to keep Gox down.

LOL. Did you just call Roger Ver a "classic Keynesian economist"? Say what you will about him, he's certainly the furthest from that. Besides, the rest of your comment is completely unintelligible. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:36:04
Both? He's a human being, not a government body. That chart isn't used to describe human action, but policy. Roger was also deep in Mises, Rothbard, and other Austrians when you were still in nappies. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:15:01
Sigh. You need to read at least one book by an Austrian economist before you start pontificating. Have you? Mises' Human Action would start sorting you out. 
You literally have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:27:34
lol. This community was way cooler back in 2012 when people who actually knew a thing or two about Austrian economics were on here. Read a book. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:46:54
What does that even mean that he's "trying to separate customers from their cash"? No Austrian even believes in the concept of "hoarding" anyway. Roger's position is that bitcoin should be money. People use money to buy things, and they also save it, but if it doesn't have utility in the market (i.e. to buy things) it's not money.

Sad but true. They couldn’t be more different from one another.
@_date: 2019-04-30 10:57:40
It’s just an exchange at this point. No sign that it would actually be used for payments, which would then create tax nightmares here.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:43:52
You’re supposed to be paying income tax on those purchases if you haven’t already. BIC allows in-store purchases up to 300k JPY, but not online. Once it’s online and much less anonymous there’s more risk. I could see it go either way, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Rakuten voluntarily reported bitcoin transactions to the authorities for tax purposes or required KYC.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:47:47
Rakuten isn’t a retailer. It’s a platform for retailers. They don’t stock or ship anything themselves. If they accept crypto as payment they’ll immediately flip it on their own exchange so they can pay the actual retailers.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:09:12
What's interesting is that there are already many many non-blockchain digital currencies in the form of large-scale point programs. T-Point, which can be used at a lot of different retailers, is basically a currency and they've now started T-Money as well. This on top of several dozen more, though they operate in a bit of a grayzone since they aren't declared as income, but also can't be transferred P2P (yet). Japan is actually an amazing place for bitcoin to take off for consumers, but no one has made anything even close to good UX for consumers and merchants.

Using Gox in Japan is actually amazing. You get same day deposits and next day withdrawals, with only your small banking fee when you transfer to them. PLUS, it's awesome for arbitrage. 
SOURCE: I do it all the time, and am in Japan
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:31:13
Umm. It's on their homepage too. Just spreading the word around. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:05:54
There's no doubt that Gox is fully liquid. A $5 million dollar seizure isn't exactly lunch money, but it's also a tiny part of their entire ledger. They have way more than that in profits, let alone customer funds. The money is there. 
The problem from my reading is that the banks will not let them transfer what they need to send out, but Gox is opening new accounts, getting licenses, and trying to fix it with new partners. These things take time and money. It's what your exchange fees are paying for. 
Everyone wants to have it both ways. You can't say that Bitcoin is the solution to the corrupt banks and financial system, and then complain about Gox when Gox is getting screwed by those same institutions. 
Do you think it's easy to jump through these hoops? It's only been 4 months since the big spike!
So if they release a statement, what can they really say? 
"$5 million is no big deal" &gt; US Gov gets pissed
"Our banks are idiots" &gt; Bank relationships ruined
"We have the money, trust us" &gt; No one believes them
These are early days for Bitcoin, and Gox has been pretty open considering how sensitive these things are. Would be great if they would respond, but either way I'm satisfied for the time being.

Good move in my opinion. Many will gripe about giving in to bank/government demands, but we all know what acting to the contrary would result in. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:58:54
Basically, yes. Paypal is connected directly to credit cards and bank accounts which do have those checks. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 07:19:02
Because the banks won't let them send them out! Gox has explained this a million times. The banks simply can't handle volume and are afraid to transfer such massive amounts all over the world. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 07:14:26
Exactly. However, the rightful owner in this case is actually Mt. Gox, as their funds are fungible and will be paid out from profits if necessary. They run a tighter ship than they get credit for as all funds are accounted for. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 16:19:41
After all, the point is to scan on the print edition, not online
@_date: 2013-06-20 09:41:27
This. The volume of wire-transfer withdrawals has surely skyrocketed since Dwolla is no longer an option, so the banks are scrambling to keep up.

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:29:54
One great way would be for retailers to accept both BTC and fiat, and offer change in BTC to anyone that wants it. It's a good way to get it out there in small doses, and also (at the beginning) encourage people to keep coming to your shop. 
For example, a coffee shop charges $3, get's a $5 bill, and gives $2 worth of BTC back to the customer through their phone if they want it. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:10:08

Mt. Gox is not insolvent. Any loss from DHS keeping these funds will just come out of profit.
