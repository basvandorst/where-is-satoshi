He is correct.
Lightning channels are really just a **series of states** that are not on the blockchain. Theoretically, both users of the channel could broadcast (or finalize) any state to the blockchain. **Even an older, invalid state.**
 Consider this scenario:
Bob wants to send Alice 1BTC
1. Bob opens a 5 BTC channel with Alice
2. Bob sends 1BTC to Alice through LN and Alice ships whatever product Bob wants to ship.
3. Alice broadcasts the correct channel state and shuts down her LN node (cause she thinks she's safe as the transaction is done).
3. Bob broadcasts the **original channel state** with a vastly higher fee (but it doesn't have to be super high, maybe use a $50 fee or something), not the *chanel state where Bob has paid Alice*. He broadcasts the state where Bob has never paid Alice.
Again, to stress the states here:
State 1: Bob has 5 BTC, Alice has 5 BTC
State 2: Bob has 4 BTC, Alice has 6 BTC as Bob has paid Alice.
Alice broadcast state 2.
Bob broadcasts state 1 (but with a higher fee).
State 1 gets committed to the blockchain (as it has a higher fee). Alice loses 5 BTC along with the product she sent to Bob.
Alice is sad. All she had to do to recover her money was to turn on her LN node. Her LN node could have broadcast the "justice" transaction and she would get all 10 BTC. In fact, she probably can still turn on her LN node and get her money back as the timelocked contract has probably still not expired yet. But she doesn't so now she is sad :(.
You are sad as well, as coinnoob is correct :(.
Seriously man. I don't go around spreading lies, I watch the lightning development repo like a hawk. I check the code repository every day, reading issues and watching the commits/development activity. I'm in the lightning-go (lnd) Slack channel. I'm far from a coin "noob".
I'm not trying to downplay LN, but you've got to seriously stop accusing anybody criticising LN as "spreading lies".
# P.S. Obviously, if you simply open a channel and make 0 transactions, you can't lose funds. But why would you open a channel if you don't want to make any transactions? You might as well just not use LN then.
# As soon as you make a transaction, you are vulnerable to losing funds. But if you keep your node running, everything will be fine.

There is no reason to keep using Bitcoin other than the fact that it **currently** has the biggest dev team and it **currently** has the widest adoption. If these factors change, then there is simply no reason to continue using Bitcoin.
If a technically superior currency ever appears, gains wide adoption and attracts a large, skilled and stable dev team, I see no reason why you should not switch to it.
Anybody attempting to lock you into the Bitcoin ecosystem is not doing it in the best interest of humanity.

"coinnoob" is correct, this is possible. Reactive security is not a bad thing however. The whole world currently relies on reactive security. When an army invades a country, the country "reacts" by mobilizing it's army.

Smaller teams result in features and code that do not get tested enough. A bigger team has the resources to write adequate unit tests for the features and code they add. A smaller team, maybe less so.
Of course, that's not to say faster moving, smaller teams that push out less-tested code are bad. They aren't and the crypto ecosystem needs them. They are the innovation that keeps the big teams moving. If you feel that using cutting edge, untested code is your cup of coffee, you should definitely move to ETH, LTC or another one of those alts.
Most coins are founded with a purpose in mind. If you agree with the goals of another coin, then by all means, switch to it.
We aren't here to brainwash you to stay (well at least most of us aren't) or praise Bitcoin as the "one true coin".

I personally do not agree with all this "alts are shitcoins" stuff but I guess that's just my opinion.
Note that untested does not equal buggy/unreliable/low quality but may be a contributing factor. I've seen good programmers that don't even need to run their code to know it works. It also depends on how well the tests are written. Testing can even bring a false sense of reliability in some cases.
90% of the software on my computer is actually in-developement, untested software and I never encounter any bugs. But I guess I just feel that I need the assurance of testing when it comes to money, hence why I stay with Bitcoin.
Either way, it's really all just opinion I suppose.

Your brain
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:24:55
- Yes I don't make many transactions, but I store my BTC in an Electrum wallet. And I have about $500 in BTC. I also have received some transactions before for development work. Fees were never really an issue for me (and I received my payments in $10 chunks!).
- I want to run a full node because I need a full node to run an Electrum server. I want to run an Electrum server because I don't trust my Electrum wallet being connected to other Electrum servers. SPV doesn't sound secure enough for me to do that.
- I spend $0 a month on BTC nodes.
- Storytime: I was running my node on one of my SSD dedicated servers. On Saturday, my weekly full server backup ran. The backup took a snapshot of the entire server and uploaded it to a backup server. The snapshot doubled the amount of used storage on the server (because now I have a snapshot of the contents of the server + whatever is on the server). Then, when uploading the backup to my backup server, the snapshot got copied to the upload cache. BAM! x3 storage usage. The blockchain is about 200GB. 200GB x 3 = 600GB which could have filled my entire SSD. Luckily, I got a notification before this happened, deleted the blockchain and rescheduled the backup.
 Yes, I know there is no point in backing up the blockchain but even if I exclude it from my backups, it still takes 200GB of storage (a lot of space for some people). Also, with a backup, if my server is destroyed, I can restore the full node from backup in 5 minutes and have it back up and running again!
- I ran the BTC node on spare bandwidth and SSD space, I never paid for it. And I was not happy at all, it took hours of setup.
- I don't think full nodes verify transactions. Don't miners verify transactions?
What doesn't make sense?

That is Satoshi's view of what Bitcoin should become. Satoshi may be the creator of Bitcoin, but he/she sure isn't god. Satoshi is not always able to make the best decisions for the future of Bitcoin. Plus, he/she isn't even around anymore!
To be honest, I do wish for Bitcoin to become digital cash, but we still have a long way to go. Most developers do see this as the eventual goal but we can't take risks. Slow and steady wins the race.

HOW DO YOU HAVE UNLIMITED DATA? AND A FUCKING FIBER CONNECTION AT YOUR HOME? I cannot imagine how rich you are.
Originally, every Bitcoin user ran a node (and the network was really decentralized). By centralizing full nodes, you are going against the very purpose of Bitcoin: "a secure, decentralized currency".
Therefore, the lowest common denominator for running a full node should be set as low as possible. For if people centralize Bitcoin, it will lose it's purpose. You may get faster transactions, but why not use a bank at that point then?
Third world countries are not being represented as they do not have enough nodes. The costs of running full nodes is already very large. We do not want them becoming larger.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:38:56
$20 a month is not cheap. I could get another dedicated server for $20 and that would be a lot more useful to me than a full node.
I'm just a high school student but I want to contribute to the network as well.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:37:41


SegWit is a code quality improvement and makes several major optimizations to the Bitcoin Core code. These optimizations decrease the amount of computing power required to run a full node.
There is literally no reason to not adopt SegWit. In fact, if you care about politics, why not just make these optimizations in your client first and then call it your own name? Then you can go bash core or something.

Another coin will simply not work. There are tons of altcoins out there but none have garnered the same success as Bitcoin. It has been proven again and again that it simply doesn't work.

This chart was produced by calculating the average size of blocks. Block size varied but never increased over 1 MB. 1 MB is a constant and does not change in the current version of Bitcoin.
BU proposes to make 1 MB a dynamic value. They believe increasing the max block size over time will allow Bitcoin to scale.
This proposal is naive because it will allow miners to increase the max blocksize to a number too high for most nodes to handle. Bigger block sizes = a bigger blockchain. If the blocksize becomes too large, users will not be able to run nodes because they don't have enough hard drive space to do so. This will cause the network to become centralized, as only the small group of wealthy people will be able to run nodes.

This is an open source project. Developers are not restricted by excessive time-constraints and monetary issues.

Because I use my server for other tasks as well. I don't want the full node bogging down my web server or streaming software.
I'm not buying a hard drive just for running a full node. Nor are hard drives cheap when you need them in a server. I'm not asking my datacenter to pop in a new drive just for my full node.
I'm not running the node on my home connection either. My home connection has only 60mbps and I use it for other things such as streaming and gaming. I lag enough in multiplayer games already...

Yes, I believe this would negatively affect the value of Bitcoins and the usefulness of the Bitcoin network.
I cannot think of a reason why miners would do this. My best guess is that the BU developers are bribing miners but I don't want to throw this around and I would hope that this is not true.
I see no reason why EC couldn't be used to lower the blocksize.

Intelligent engineers don't band-aid. It's true. They avoid it at all costs. In this case however, we are dealing with a global currency. This is not some startup company project or something, billions of dollars are on the line here.
If I really have to use a band-aid, I will use it really, really, really carefully. I avoid releasing if there is a band-aid in the codebase. Even in the case that I do need a band-aid, I will make sure that in the case that band-aid breaks, I have many safeguards. I will usually put a `try-catch` around the block of dangerous code, and make sure that any errors are remotely logged. Then I will follow up with verification code to make sure the dangerous code is actually doing it's job. If the verification fails, we will also automatically report the error. If either of these cases occur, the entire operation will be rolled back (the operation is done atomically). If the operation is not atomic, the program will immediately abort and the user will receive some sort of warning message and the program will refuse to start (because the data is corrupted). The next time the user wishes to start the program, he/she will need to forcibly override this. If I am still worried, I will also silently backup the application's data before running all of this.
I'm not an intelligent engineer either, I'm just some random high-school student. But no engineer likes to see bugs in their code. I do everything I can to make sure users will not lose data.
You underestimate engineers and software developers.

It won't be as bad as you think. Most nodes run on core so they will simply reject the new chain. Since the new chain's transactions won't be relayed, it will die off eventually or be useless.
It will be a different story however if BU gets more nodes but it doesn't look like this will happen fast enough.

Bitcoin value comes from demand.
Just like collectables. They are worth nothing physically but people want them so they are worth a lot.


No it isn't. The value of BTC is increasing (more demand from more people). BTC has been here for 7+ years and it is far from dead. If we are losing the network effect, it's value would have been decreasing.
Also, some people dislike change. Rapid changes to the structure and design Bitcoin may kill it for these people.
As a developer, I get annoyed when a library updates very often. Why? Because it means I have to test it again to make sure that the update didn't break anything. If it broke stuff, I have to rewrite my code. If I don't know what changed, I have to reread the docs.
Change is good, but change must be paired with graceful transitions or we risk leaving people in the dust.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:22:41
To be honest, I don't move my money around a lot so speed of transactions doesn't mean much to me.
Off-chain transactions will fix the transaction fees (in my opinion). Plus, Segwit does give us a block size increase (but without making the blockchain significantly bigger).
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:40:12
I wish I had multiple servers with hundreds of GB of SSD space :(. In reality, only one of my servers have SSDs.
I have one server with about 400GB of SSD space. I have another server with 2TB of HDD space. I have 6TB of backup space I got for free on some random cloud hosting website. All of this costs under $30 a month (got this by browsing LowEndTalk for 2 hours every day looking for deals), pretty awesome!
I have an old computer at home hooked up to 7 50GB hard drives via USB 2.0 which acts as my seedbox. It has a terrible CPU so I didn't even try to setup a node on this one. It can't even handle web requests quickly and runs nginx!
I need to store the entire blockchain because the Electrum server does not work with pruned nodes. I can not run the node on a raspberry pi because a raspberry pi will probably not be able to handle my Electrum server. Also, again, I don't want to spend any money specifically on Bitcoin.
I am renting these high-spec servers because I need them to act as the backend for some of apps I make. I did not even consider Bitcoin nodes when I bought them. The reason why they had enough resources to run a node is because my apps didn't use a ton of CPU/RAM/HDD. I left some extra CPU/RAM/HDD for compiling apps because my laptop is crap. Since I'm not compiling apps 24/7 I decided to put a Bitcoin node on one of them and move my Bitcoins to an Electrum wallet (they were on Blockchain before).
I want to run a BTC node because I want an Electrum server for myself. The Electrum network feels too centralized to me and I don't want my wallet to rely on someone else's Electrum server. I planned to setup a BTC node + Electrum server and keep the Electrum thin client on my garbage laptop. Obviously, this is not working out currently. Maybe I will put the node on the server with the 2 TB HDD but that server doesn't have much spare CPU and RAM (it's a storage server)...
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:30:05

I'm trying really hard to make room however as I want to host an electrum server for myself because I don't want  my wallet relying on someone else's electrum server.

Hence people demand more Bitcoin! Also, no, you don't need Bitcoin to use the Blockchain (if that's the network your taking about). Also, what make Bitcoin a "utility"? What separates it from a collectible?


Why would the Blockchain lose "utility"? The Blockchain is useful for other things as well.


Some altcoins are used for other purposes. "Coins" are different from each other and appeal to different people. It would be naive to view them all as just another "crypto".

I just don't want it on my home connection. And yes, I want to do it spending as little money as possible (free would be nice). I also don't have any machines at home to run the BTC node on.
I have a seedbox with a bunch of external hard drives attached to it using USB 2.0 but if I put the node on there the disk IO would probably cripple the node :(.

Or there might be poor people in this world that have limited bandwidth on their internet connections. So in poor countries (with poor people), we have less nodes. As a dev, you must worry about cases like this.

@_date: 2017-03-19 17:43:10
Yes, I know what SPV is. But, SPV nodes do not validate and relay transactions and thus do not assist on verifying the blockchain.
Clearly, not every user can run a node. But we need to have as many nodes as possible in as many different countries as possible to keep the network decentralized and make sure that everybody can validate the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-03-09 18:12:04
This entire debate is very political. The reason we are even debating is because you talked about "democracy".
If there are no users and no influence, then we don't even have to worry about block size because there would be fewer transactions per block and our blocks would be empty. The only reason we have worry about block size is because the influence of Bitcoin is growing.
If we don't talk about the politics, there is nothing to debate about.

Value comes from demand, and it looks like people demand more Bitcoin. That's why it's worth so much. End of story.
If there is less demand in the future, Bitcoin will be worth less. Turning Bitcoin into digital cash will increase demand, but there are other ways to increase demand as well.
Stop forcing your vision of Bitcoin onto others. Bitcoin is decentralized and everybody can have their own views in what it should turn into.

Obviously I know that but as long as the transaction goes through *eventually*, I'm fine. I never expect my transaction to go through. When it does, it's always &gt;3 days later. And that's fine, because I don't need the money right away.
Again, I don't expect it to confirm the first time or even the second time. It's just nice that there is a reasonable chance it will get confirmed. I'm playing a gamble here but it's fine since if I lose, I can just play again (for no cost).
If there are a bunch of mempool spammers however, I can no longer play this gamble since the chance my transaction gets confirmed is now astronomically shall. That sucks since my transaction did have a chance for getting confirmed! It may have been small, but it did have a chance!
The is no doubt that mempool spammers have a negative impact on the Bitcoin network. Whether or not this impact is significant enough too warrant action however, is another question. In my *opinion*, we should take action against them as it makes people like me lose money. It's just a tiny bit of money but since I don't have a lot of BTC to begin with, I save where I can, even if it means picking up scraps.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:37:23
Sometimes I need to send money between my "donation" wallet and my "main/spending" wallet. In this case, I couldn't care less how long it takes for the transaction to go through, I would just like the money to arrive there eventually (I don't live off of donation money so I don't need the money right away).
I don't get donations often. If I do, it's usually 5$ USD worth of BTC or less. I do try to group transactions together when sending them to my main wallet but it doesn't help that much if the transaction still has many inputs!
That's why I crank that fee slider all the way down to the bottom when I make these transactions. I don't need the money in my main wallet right away but I would still like it to pop up there eventually. If the transaction sits in the mempool for too long and gets bumped out, that's fine! I don't need that money right away, I'll just broadcast that transaction again!
Side note: I avoid spending from my donation wallet since it's just a single address and it's good practice to avoid reusing addresses when spending BTC. My main wallet consists of multiple addresses so I don't have to worry about address reuse once the money reaches it.
This is my workflow and why I need ultra-low-fee transactions. I'm sure many developers also use the same workflow:
1. Post donation address
2. Receive many donations as tiny individual micro-transactions at address.
3. Group together micro-transactions and send to main wallet using a low fee.     
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:09:52
What about legitimate 0-5 fee transactions that need to go through? Obviously, miners won't include those transactions unless the mempool is near-empty but whatever confirmation chance they had is now completely gone!

Because maybe people like to save money (like me)?
That spammer probably spent more money on spam transaction fees than you! He probably spent time and money programming the spam bot.

A bunker is impossible to defend without soldiers. Nothing is possible to defend without people. People are a fundamental part of any and all systems. Nothing can/will change that, nor will Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:53:23
The definition of something encompasses it as a whole. Bitcoin is made up of three parts:
- Miners
- Developers
- Users
Miners are required to keep the network secure and resolve developer conflicts.
Developers are required to keep the network secure, add new features and fix bugs.
Users are required to incentivize the miners and resolve developer conflicts.
If any of these parts are destroyed, Bitcoin will die. Miners do not define what Bitcoin is, but the developers, miners and users combined do. These three parts are also not completely separate. Miners can be developers, devs can be users, users can be miners, etc... Separately they are nothing, but together, they are Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:57
This is actually bad practice. Good practice is to split the system into submodules with one module specifically focused on defence. The other modules attempt to avoid failure and avoid attacks, but do not actively attempt to defend themselves.  The defence module is the master of defence and can defend the program without having to worry about anything else.
Bad practice is putting everything in one module. This one module attempts to be the jack of all trades, but is instead matter of none. It becomes a huge, monolithic mess.
Just like in real life. You put the armor and shields around the things you try to defend. You do not integrate them into whatever you are defending. This causes whatever you are defending to become a tangled mess of interlocking systems.
The users play an important part in Bitcoin. They ensure the integrity of currency. That are the defence module. You can't just take the users out of the equation, they are a fundamental part of the system itself.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:59:13
Similar to how a country needs defenders. Bitcoin is powered by it's community. The moment the community abandons Bitcoin, Bitcoin dies. This is the same with any project.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:03:17
Miners do not define what Bitcoin is, but Bitcoin cannot survive without miners. I'm not saying that you should pull out an old ASIC or GPU and work away however.
Bitcoin does need defenders, but not necessarily miners. For example, the developers actually defend Bitcoin in a way (as you said). But a currency is useless without users, thus the users are also defenders.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:28:29
And that's it! A bunker can only defend against specific attacks. To make the bunker defend against more and more attacks, it must become more and more complex and expensive.
If you add people however, you can do things like:
- call in reinforcements
- reinforce your bunker depending on the situation outside (instead of attempting to predict and prepare for every possible case in advance).
- counterattack
- think up of other possible defense mechanisms
People are reactive. This is what makes them great defenders. They can build new defenses as new threats arise. That's why in datacenters, even with all the heavy duty anti-DDOS mechanisms in place, they still have technicians on site 24/7 monitoring critical infrastructure.
Machines can't do what people do. People can do what machines can do.

_There has currently been very little traction on the POW change._

Miners are users...

Why would they have the economic incentive to hard fork after Segwit activates?
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:09:08
Why do you need proof? Heck, why would you care if it was all a lie?
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:25:59
They also have this incentive right now. I don't think any sane person would trust a company soft forking to activate a technology and then hard forking to revert the change. It's simply an obvious mistake and I have no idea who would jump onto their chain following such actions.

Tons of examples out there. Example result on first page of this Google Search query: 'reddit blockchain spam'.

Nobody gets anything out of DOS attacks, but people still do it. Why?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:29:58
Mining software doesn't care. Look at miner.cpp here: 
In the '*addPackageTxs*' function, the node determines which transactions to include in the next block. The algorithm makes **no attempt** for a balanced block size. It **packs the block as full as it can** and moves on.
Please correct me if I am wrong, I sometimes miss things in source code.

My wallet got corrupted last week. I just calmly walked over to my locked filing cabinet, pulled out my seed and entered it into electrum again.
Was very annoyed that I lost my notes for each transaction but at least I have my coins!

People have attempted it recently. The reason we sometimes have giant backlogs of transactions is because people are spamming the network with dust!

A voila: 
For non-techy:

We don't even have to know it is spam. All the requirements are already fullfilled:
- They are creating a bunch of micro transactions
- It is detrimental to the network
- Whether they are doing this with good or bad intentions, it is a burden on the network and they should bear the consequences of it

Or, you could have a miner who wants as much fees as possible (most miners like money) and he/she will just stuff blocks with txs to get the tx fees. Or we could have a malicous miner stuffing blocks with txs paired with a malicous user generating those txs and bam, same situation.
Now your saying: "Remove the spam filter and hope that no one bothers to spam us".
Nothing has changed :/...

Do you understand the technical side of things? Bitcoin quite literally, just **CANNOT** technically handle large block sizes yet. Block sizes grow as technology evolves. The cap can be increased (and that's what Segwit is here for) but it cannot be completely removed.
If it is removed, a bunch of kids can just walk in, spam the network with some tiny transactions and bring down the whole system! The block size protects the network from spam. What your saying is basically: "Oh, ho! Remove the spam filter! Nothing could go wrong!".
No, **shit will happen** and damn reckless it is, to remove spam filters.
Even EC refuses to remove the limit. Not even they, are that clueless.
