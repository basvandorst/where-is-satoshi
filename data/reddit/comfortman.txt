To the motherfucker who came and downvoted this straight away, come back and explain why.

He is also assuming you aren't holding any bitcoins at the time, and so his example includes the cut taken by the exchange.

Great work. You've been very proactive about getting the word out, especially to these guys that are surrounded by people working in finance who dismiss bitcoin as ridiculous and doomed to fail. Once again great work.

'Piques', I think. Never mind - I read your post wrong.

Cancel that, I've got a link to it.

It's a magazine by ICAEW (Institute for Chartered Accountants in England and Wales - they are the ones that supervise the accountancy professional qualifications here), so it has gone out to many of the accountancy firms based in the UK.
It appears as though Economia's website it broken at the moment, and doesn't have an online version of the article anyway. Regardless, [here]( is the home page. If it was there, it would be under the 'opinion' heading.

I can't see how adding a paper wallet to your blockchain.info account as 'watch only' could compromise its security, because you only put in the public address. The private address never touches the blockchain.info account.
If this is wrong, please reply. I've only very recently bought in to bitcoins and am still learning.

When you transfer any amount of money out of your address it sends *all* of your money out, so you need to specify an account to which the change from the transaction will go.

The value of them changes. If people affix a certain value to 1 BTC then a fraction of it will be worth the same fraction of the price. I'm sure you understand that.
With your earlier post, you were trying to say that because you can keep dividing the BTC to make smaller and smaller units, the market should be oversaturated as there are a seemingly infinite amount of units. That isn't the case though, because each of those smaller units is valued according to how each whole BTC is valued, and there are only a finite amount of whole BTCs.

Seems to work fine. So then is it a problem with the app or is it an issue with my device?

So it tries to keep the amounts that came from the same place together? I worded that badly but I think I understand. Thank you!
