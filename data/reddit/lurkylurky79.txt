Who is being censored? Isn’t this case about Twitter not stopping Nunes from being mocked, and his claim that the mockery hurt him in the midterms? Not sure how anyone could see this as anything other then frivolous.

I don’t see how a frivolous lawsuit would drive him to try and move his cash.

I’m about to buy, so your moment is coming soon.

And it is a big one.

I don’t know what this is all about, but I want to know more...

Hi! I’m going to have to disagree with your assessment about “people stuff”. I a Simple Middle Aged American Male. Make a comfortable living, have 2 kids, a house, etc. So I believe I am a good representation of the “people” you mention. 
I invest in Bitcoin, and also use it from time to time. I’m paying attention, however I can’t jump to far in since I have a family to protect and provide comfort to. I can’t put a substantial amount into anything, risk aversion is how I keep my family safe. 
That being said, My comfort with Bitcoin increases more and more each day/month/year it simply survives. There are only so many. I’d be a fool to not at least make regular investments that I can make responsibly. 
I represent, without a doubt, one of Bitcoins greatest hopes. Middle-Class America. We’ve got disposable income to invest, and are getting settled financial. And if my normal, average self is paying attention, then you can bet there are at least a few hundred more like me. I’m talking to other people, a few of which have started investing as well. They all talk to their friends, and so on. Several of my friends have also increased there investment steadily, as I have. 
I could be totally wrong, and I am an outlier. But my boring average ass is betting there are a lot of   us people.
