Hey! I know you're making fun of us with starcraft!
But.. you know... that's actually not bad of a name..

Jack! It's Eric. I hope you had a safe flight back. 
It was real good meeting you and thanks for the kind words!

Yup. We're launching payment soon and we already have couple major companies that deal with Chinese tourists in Korea that are in lined with us. We're definitely working hard for merchants to adopt btc. 
Thanks for the tip!

As much as you want the remittance market, we do too. But it's not easy and there are strict financial laws that we cannot currently break through from Korea. (We tried but once you deal with USD, it's a whole another ball game and a startup with less than $1million investment cannot touch it)
Basically, Korea is already very easy to live if you're Korean. All you need is your ID number and verification. 
But first, we want to dominate our front yard before going out to the field. 
As for your first question, we are not better than them at the moment. We want to be. How we want to be is as follows: Offer a multi-sig exchange system (think coinbase) offering user end cold storage system (in development) and easy UI/UX.

So there are about 5-6 active exchanges which three of them have services like bitpay. 
If I had to simply put, the bitcoin industry in the business side is pretty active, just a lack of consumers/users at the moment. 
Crypto is pretty active as well, alot of people still mining various crypto as well as creating altcoins themselves... 
All in all though, the bitcoin/crypto scene is still very unknown compared to the fact that Korea is one of the most innovative countries in terms of IT.
And we are among many startups/companies trying to get the ball going!

Nope. Although these 'bars' that I only 'heard of' would make use of bitcoin payments very well...

You would have to transfer KRW to our virtual account that is individually given to every user. (This is created automatically once you register)
This is the only way all Korean exchanges do at the moment...
I understand it is difficult if you do not have a Korean bank account to begin with, but if you do, it is very easy since there are no wire fees to deposit KRW. (You can deposit as little as 10,000 Won which is 10 dollars and you can withdraw as little as 5,000 Won) But there is a constant withdrawal fee of 1,000 Won which is less than 1 Dollar, no matter the amount.

Hi, first off, thanks for sharing your experience. 
I personally have used Korbit and pretty much any other major exchanges in Korea. (Coinplug, Xcoin)
As you said, Korean exchanges are mostly 0% fee (because Xcoin offered 0% and other exchanges had to follow through to survive) and offer very satisfactory customer service. 
I'm actually very happy you had a positive experience with Korbit because although they are technically our competitor, we genuinely want the Bitcoin presence to grow in Korea. 
With that said, I strongly believe Korean exchanges are very easy to use in terms of UX. Not because of futures, not because of extremely high volume but because of satisfactory customer experience. Like, Japan and other Asian countries, customer service is very important to a company's image and customers will not tolerate any setbacks or problems. These can include anything between lengthy deposit/withdrawal times, laggy website, lengthy email responses, etc. 
We, Coinone team, are trying to advance our trading market to the international waters but we cannot offer USD (or other international) fiat withdrawal atm. (We're trying to achieve international currencies)
However, anyone can still deposit BTC into our exchange, trade, and withdraw back in BTC. 
If anyone here is wanting to try out Korean services, I am here to help you, personally and commercially. 
PS. I am not sure when you traded with Korbit but the prices are pretty much very closely aligned in all exchanges. The reason KRW seems higher is because Koreans factor in currency exchange rate between USD=KRW. It may be slightly higher than the actual exchange rate but this is because Korean exchanges have 0% fee and it accounts for arbitrage trading with other international exchanges (with fees).

This is the exact notion we are trying to change. Bitcoin users aren't entirely made up of what you've said above. In fact only a very small portion. But that's a given for any currency, if not more. 
It's a slow and small start but Bitcoin is only growing and so does its community. 
Thanks for the comment :) facesofbitcoin

We have benchmarked from Humans of New York and other various 'Humans of' projects.
I am trying to put a normal face with Bitcoin, trying to show the world that Bitcoin isn't all used by hackers, nerd techies, and other stereotypes. 
The mission here is to say that Bitcoin users are also normal everyday people like you and I. 
WITHOUT advertising people to BUY or JOIN/REGISTER an exchange or whatever else. 
Thanks and any likes or comments would be appreciated. Really.

No.. no selling of emails.. We don't even have a database of emails.
Currently I am asking my personal friends and aquaintances. I then plan to receive interview and receive their pictures via FB message. So no personal emails will be revealed. 
Thanks for your comment tho 500 bits
