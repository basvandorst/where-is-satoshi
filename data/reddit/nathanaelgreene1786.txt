Fake News!

"I" think your source is wrong.

Selling my Bitcoin for alts is a taxable event? So if I convert 0.01 Bitcoin to 70 Ripple I have to pay taxes on that? I thought the taxable event only occurred when you sell Bitcoin for fiat.

At least edit the post to show the correct sources stating that Bitcoin is Haram (forbidden) in Islamic culture. Don't spread false messages of "an influx of middle eastern investors! Bitcoyn tew teh mewn$!!"
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:42:08
The large amount of volatility the past few days isn't good.... steady rise would be much better for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:02
The only reason Bitcoin got so much higher than other cryptos is because it was the first mover and most well known. But it actually sucks compared to other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:06:10
Just to play devils advocate, couldn't BTC buyers be the ones who are suckered into investing in an currency that doesn't actually exist?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:40
I think you're wrong. Islamic Clerics declared it "haram" or forbidden in Islam. A quick Google search shows this. Source -

Since Bitcoin broke 10k and has been all over the media, I have noticed this as well. I'm currently in the works making a PowerPoint slideshow to show the people who have been asking me about it. A sort of Bitcoin beginner tutorial.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:21:50
If Bitcoin were to go up to 100k in the next 5 years, Satoshi Nakamoto (who has an estimated 1 Mil BTC) would be have a total value of $100 Billion, roughly the valuation of Jeff Bezos. I feel like there are some wealthy hodlers that got in early and could be super rich crypto lords who rule the future.

Lol you jinxed it
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:04:50
1 BTC = 1BTC / 0.001 BTC = 1 mBTC / 0.000001 BTC = 1 bit / 0.00000001 BTC = 1 satoshi 
There is not need to "divide the price of Bitcoin by 1000" as there are already smaller units of measurement. There are scheduled to be 21 million Bitcoin created. No more no less.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:10:44
I'm not using it for buying BTC with debt. I just don't want to attach my bank account.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:35:34
I get that diversifying is good, but why buy LTC? I have thought about it, but I don't understand the underlying technology/ why it would be better than BTC
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:01:38
Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:29:18
I don't feel safe giving that information out to Coinbase  (or anyone for that matter). I'd rather stick with paying a bit extra with my credit card than risk my bank account.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:21:57
I agree with that. But I would only buy like $30-$40 of a few altcoins. Not 25% of my portfolio....
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:58:17
I think it's fairly easy to distinguish between "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Cash". Is BCC actually an altcoin though?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:26:32
I just sent you 0.65 Bitcoin :) I enjoy sending crypto to people who beg :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:39:11
Best of luck with coin base help. You could try canceling/disputing the charge with you bank.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:28:23
I stopped using Coinbase and switched to Gemini. Lower fees and easier to use.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:27:28
Tell your parents to buy some for you
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:08
You should verify your identity with Coinbase so that they don't restrict your buy/sell. Make sure you are aware of the risks associated with putting your personal information online. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:44:46
Always do many research before you invest in something like this.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:05:35
Oh ok, so your service is free if you don't want my money?
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:43:32
You want me to give you money to buy Bitcoins for me? I can do that myself for free.....
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:02:05
I think I'm having a seizure.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:46:12
Shameless business plug, check.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:21:16
I think that security is also a possible issue (Mt. Gox). With technology advancing so fast, Bitcoin could be threatened by hackers who target exchanges, miners, or large Bitcoin hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:48:56
INVEST IN LIBERTYCOINS (BITCOIN)!
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:43:22
Anyone ever checkout r/buttcoin? They get really upset every time Bitcoin reaches a new ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:32:22
So do you actually think there is a need for an escrow service when buying/selling crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:43:32
/s. I say this because it is not good to tell the world (reddit) how many coins you own. It opens yourself up to scammers and hackers. OP deleted his comment though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:09:19
Do not say how many Bitcoin you have or had either. The IRS will find you.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:08:02
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:34:48
Most people on this sub have ~$50-$200 to throw at Bitcoin. I think you're preaching to the wrong market.
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:01:29
I have to write about a speculative bubble, but I am going to argue against it at the end of my paper. Prof just wants us to learn bubbles
@_date: 2017-04-10 03:29:53
This makes no sense, any asset can be a bubble. There has been a fee mini bubble already that follow the Jean Paul Bubble Stages to a T
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:00:45
Currently @ 59% network consensus, needs to reach 75%:
Also, apparently Bitcoin needs to reach 95% network acceptance??? That seems a little crazy....
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:55:45
This entire thread hurts me physically when I read it. I wish I could have gotten in when it was in the single digits...
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:16:16
Yeah, no offense but I don't think this is right. ~12k Bitcoin value to be in the top 2% of Bitcoin hodlers? I don't think so
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:15:34
Have you never heard of Tulip Mania? The price of a flower rose exponentially and caused a depression for the years to come. You cannot say that "Bitcoin can't be a bubble"
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:43:30
I stopped checking the price of Bitcoin almost daily. I can determine price fluxuations by what meme is here.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:47:47
Exactly what I was looking for, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:41:27
And that single last satoshi will be worth so much.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:26:51
One day, people will be mining for a single satoshi!
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:30:07
I feel like there wasn't much analysis other than: "Bitcoin is volitile and I expect it to drop to 5k".
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:45:19
It's honestly not that hard to tell that Bitcoin is in a bubble. Extreme volatility, rapid price increases, extreme consumer adoption, feel like the price will keep going up. The trick is to know when the top of the bubble is and where the floor is when it bursts. Don't act so high and mighty cuz you got lucky
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:13:13
No, just my general knowledge about phone security and people who reccomend using mobile wallets for small amounts of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:46:02
Hopefully ~$1000 so I can buy more at a reasonable price
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:59:08
I hope so. I'm sure there will be many who panic sell
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:07:23

Why don't you invest in Trezor with your earnings then???
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:49:38
WHY YOU CHOOSE TO INVEST AT ALL TIME HIGH?? WHY???
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:52:29
I think you can hire someone on the darknet who specializes in making people disappear. Then you can pay him/her in Bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:54:42
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:10:20
Trezor is everything I need and want
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:04:56
I immediately don't trust anything when it's typed in all caps
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:50:00
Yes. I am not exactly sure how it will work and how to access it, but you will get 1 BCC for 1 BTC on a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:54:05
Tragic 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:57:44
Wouldn't feel comfortable shorting Buttcoin. Is there even a way to short it?
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:03:09
I would honestly want for a dip in BCC or at least wait a few weeks for the flames to cool down. Everyone here will tell you that BCC is never going to work. If you want more opinions on the matter, check out r/btc.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:46:43
Let it go down. Just means we HODLRS can buy more at a cheaper price
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:20:00
I personally would use a hardware wallet like KeepKey or Trezor, but it depends on the amount of Bitcoin you have. If you have larger amounts of Bitcoin, it is safer to use a hardware wallet for security reasons. Also to add, the reason people are saying take your Bitcoin off of an exchange is because some exchanges (like Coinbase) are not supporting BCC and you will not be able to access the BCC coins through that exchange. Aka you will lose free money.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:05:27
Kraken will be supporting BCC and you will not lose anything if you keep your coins with them. After the fork, you will have 3 BTC and 3 BCC.
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:41:46
Interesting read regarding the past two "mini bubbles" in bitcoin and why there's going to be a third: 
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:15:28
I think your graph is incorrect. Is this showing the past year of Bitcoin or longer?
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:59:26
And HE roped me into this!
