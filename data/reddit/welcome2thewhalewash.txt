If you're talking about Segwit2x, that was technically "called off". In reality, 6 or so highly influential people decided to abandon the idea, or at least said they were. That's what sparked all this fuss about moving to Bitcoin Cash. That being said, 6 people can't call off a fork so it may still happen. Its just much less likely.  
And again, what I said before. What happens tomorrow doesn't matter. Maybe the fork happens and there's a mass exodus from Bitcoin to B2X in search of lower transaction fees. Bitcoin's price would plummet. It would take some time to get the price back up, but it will happen eventually. You just have to have the guts to not sell when the price drops. You haven't lost any money until you lock in your losses by selling. If you only sell when you're green, you will always make a profit.

So with a node, all I'm doing is supporting the network and nothing else?

Could you elaborate on the point you made about buying hardware wallets from sites such as Amazon? How commonplace is this hacking issue? Is there a way to verify the validity of your hardware when you receive it to ensure it hasn't been tampered with?

It sounds like you aren't too comfortable seeing your investment go red, and as such you may wanna read more about Bitcoin before investing. For me, it doesn't matter when I invest because I look at the big picture. I believe in Bitcoin and I expect its price will multiply over the course of years. If I invest today and Bitcoin's value halves tomorrow, so be it. Because in a few years (usually much sooner), it will be back up to where it was and then some.  
TL:DR. Don't buy bitcoin if you care what your balance will look like tomorrow.
