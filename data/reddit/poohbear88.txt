Valid point. But most people would give first and THEN see they've been con'd by a 30 yr old homeless millionaire.

What are some good alternatives to Dwolla?
Just deactivated.

Do you think the long transfer times are in place to prevent arbitrage trading? Or is that irrelevant?

Ok, that helps a lot. So localbitcoins is almost like a craigslist for bitcoin transactions? I'm not really one to meet strangers like this - not that i'm afraid, i've just never done it. Have you had any bad experiences meeting someone in person from this site?

Bah, humbug. I'd rather share my wealth with my family or maybe a close friend that doesn't have a job. 
I don't subscribe to the "do-gooder" lifestyle. People eventually start taking advantage of you.
If you must share your wealth, do it anonymously. You'd be surprised how much jealousy comes about when you are "so wealthy" that you have the luxury of being able to give cash away freely.
I'm not a Christian, but Matthew 6:3 comes to mind...

No you're right, it's a scam.

I mean for purchasing bitcoin. Dwolla was my way to send USD to CampBX.

How much do they typically pay out?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:34:07
Mostly because the banks want to hold on to your cash for as long as possible before it leaves their possession.

What payment method do you ultimately prefer use on localbitcoins? Dwolla, Paypal, etc?
@_date: 2013-05-01 01:22:35
Wouldn't using Paypal completely eliminate the whole point of using Bitcoin (anonymity)?
