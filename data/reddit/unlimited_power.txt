I see your point. Everyone must make an individual decision.
My issue is that I'm still uneasy with the amount of incentive for current miners to not change anything. They are currently raking in huge profits using highly specialized infrastructure, and this would all be lost with a change in the system. Thus, they would be smart to keep the original system alive for as long as possible.
So the benefits of a hard fork would have to be enough such that it would entice enough people to switch over so it could eventually overcome the network effects of the original system.
I am extremely interested in seeing whether this happens and when--whether with a hard fork or a totally new alt. As time goes on and more and more people invest into the current system, it becomes more difficult.
But of course, THIS IS BITCOIN™, and the name of the game is chaos and bloodshed. It's going to be an interesting decade.

Good luck convincing the mining pools to switch so they can lose all their profits. I think Bitcoin likely has too many entrenched interests at this point to make any big changes unless we have a *massive* catastrophe.
For those interested in other systems with potential improvements, I encourage reading this paper [Transactions as Proof-of-Stake &amp; The End of Mining]( This describes a new form of Proof-of-Stake (different than PPC) that will be used in [BitShares]( (due out in Q2 2014), among other things.

There's no promises. Value is maintained from competitors taking opposing positions betting in the market. This gives you a price peg to USD, for example, without ever needing payment in actual USD. There is mandatory collateral that ensures loans are always covered.

Ah I assumed $ because you wrote that in your post. I admit I don't know that much about the EU but I would guess with the whole Eurozone crisis that euros are also being printed constantly (correct me if I am wrong of course) same as dollars in the US. So with each newly printed euro, every euro you own is worth less ("burning"). This is a problem bitcoin does not have.

Recently watched this very good video on the difference between *money* and *currency*: 
It seems that money is currency but with the additional property that money is also a store of value.
The dollar continuously loses value due to inflation, which makes it a poor store of value (savings account or not). This makes it unsuitable for use as money, but it is still a viable currency.
A goal for bitcoin seems to be that it should one day be stable enough to be a true store of value, since it is not vulnerable to inflation. This would make it suitable for use as both money (savings) and currency.

Yes, they are in fact Chase dollars and you would be wise to treat them as such. Or it may be even better to acknowledge that they are not dollars, but a promise by Chase to repay the dollars that you loaned them. They can default on this debt and you will not be repaid. You also cannot just "get them whenever you want". These are no longer your dollars, and so there are always withdrawal limits.

Coinbase is notorious for orders being cancelled. If this happens you need to pull a ticket and they will generally whitelist you or something so it doesn't happen in the future. If you ask nice they should put the canceled order through at the original price.

This is sort of a purpose of [Protoshares]( The idea is that people interested in DACs will mine and trade the protoshares with the hope of getting stakes in future DACs, and then any future DAC that comes out can use the protoshare ledger as a starting point to start instantly so their shares are already distributed to stakeholders.

I would argue that neither is real (base) money. Both are debts to the depositor, and thus do affect the market as such. But neither add to the supply of base money.
I didn't understand your point before but I think I am starting to see it.
I think there's a lot of misunderstanding between people in this thread (how can people misunderstand each other on the internet?!).
People, including myself, are getting caught up with the technology of the blockchain. I think some of my confusion stemmed from an intuition that the line between M0 and M1 for dollars feels like it can be fuzzy, when compared to M0 of bitcoin, which has a hard upper bound.
However, I think it should be noted that as long as the block reward is greater than 0 (originally planned to hold until 2140), bitcoin is inflationary. I define inflation as an increase of M0.
So, for example, a FRB bitcoin bank could very well promise bitcoins to you that don't exist at the time of the promise, and gamble that by the time you withdraw, the bank has mined enough new coins to cover your deposit.
The inflation idea makes it clearer, but it's not even necessary--replace "mined" in the previous sentence with "earned".
I originally had the intuition that such an FRB system offers no advantages in the bitcoin system, and thus shouldn't ever succeed. But the more I think about it, I can't see why this would be the case.
We as ideological bitcoiners tend to want to eradicate FRB and inflation, but the fact remains that bitcoin will continue to be inflationary for the next 100 years or so.
And again, the inflationary property is sufficient to enable FRB but it's not even necessary:




I get it now.
