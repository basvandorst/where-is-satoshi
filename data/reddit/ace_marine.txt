Ok but that represents the infrastructure surrounding bitcoin but not bitcoin itself. The value is being produced by people. What if people no longer value bitcoin or a government declares the currency defunct in place of their own currency?

Gold is tangible and therefore backs itself. We set prices on gold based on what we believe gold is worth. A gold brick is literally worth it's weight.

I'm sorry I'm still having a hard time :(. Maybe it's because I'm having trouble envisioning the tangibility of bitcoin. It lacks any organization, regulation, or establishment and yet people are placing value on something that exists in a completely digital sphere. To me this is the equivalent of trading marbles. They may not actually be worth much but people pay a lot of money for something that they believe has value. Even if a marble is only actually worth $0.01, people are willing to pay $100. It appears vastly overvalued for a something we do not actually understand the value of.

Very interesting. I was approaching bitcoin from a very uneducated sphere so I appreciate you entertaining my ignorance. Now armed with a better understanding I have to ask: how can bitcoin lose value? If it's regulated and is a product that represents very linear predictible data points it seems impossible for it to decrease in value at all. Just a slow steady crawl upward. Holy shit I want in!

Are those calculations really worth the current value bitcoin? It seems a very high price to pay for some automated math problems.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:33
That brings up another question. If bitcoin is "mined" doesn't that mean it's being produced? If amount of bitcoin goes up shouldn't that bring the price down? It's not like there is a finite amount of work a computer can calculate things.

I appreciate your insights regardless. Thanks for entertaining my question.

That makes me nervous in the same way that people had faith in mortgage securities. The belief that it was a solid investment was incorrect and it crashed remarkably.

Faith in a societal element is what backs fiat currency. Hence why money based in more stable countries tends to be worth more than destabilized countries.

The question posed was a result of my failure to fundamentally understand what bitcoin was. It was a question based in ignorance not in malice.

True but you have to declare it as income and they represent a certain amount.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:29:18
How is bitcoin non-taxable? It qualifies as income doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:23:06
So bitcoin represents the work automated equipment produce? This is the first tangible thing I can understand where bitcoin forms value. It represents work performed by AI? Or work performed by computers?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:38:15
There's a nice way to do that...

Which is a bad business model. Just because I believe in a successful outcome doesn't mean the result will be successful. Belief and tangible result are two separate entities and require each other in order to produce something of value. Just because an engineer has designed a vehicle doesn't mean anything of any actual value is produced until a car is built. To me bitcoin looks like value placed on something without any actual product. There is nothing carrying any actual value. The currency is an intangible asset produced through intangible means. In other words, bitcoin has no actual value and people are using it as a medium in between two tangible assets. Like say you want to use bitcoin to buy a house, you use tangible cash to purchase bitcoin then use bitcoin to purchase a house. Isn't it an unnecessary middleman?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:14
Using that logic then, wouldn't bitcoin simply continue to increase in value as more solutions are found? It would perpetuate until either the cost of mining coins exceeds the value they produced or.... annnnd I just realized that bitcoin IS the product not a currency. Now I get it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:54:54
Cool but what happens if electricity becomes cheap or free with solar. Wouldn't that be like producing value from thin air?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:48:23
I figured I'd get the dumbed down version by having my questions answered directly. Especially when you factor in my poor understanding of general economic tools. I understand better now because I was thinking of Bitcoin as a generic digital currency (think Warcraft gold) when I should be thinking of it as a product produced through computers solving equations. Bitcoin is both literally and figuratively a product of computer calculations.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:54:15
Interesting. What other self regulations does Bitcoin employ? I didn't realize that the industry was regulating itself. I though it was unimpeded runaway capitalism.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:08
This makes me nervous because people value things differently. Back in the 2000s I could introduce you to some people who had faith their beenie babies were worth considerably more than what they were actually worth.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:26:29
That makes me nervous about investing because it sounds like a securities bubble. It's value isn't based on anything besides what people believe it to be valued at, in which case they could be wrong, the currency is actually worthless, and it could completely crash literally overnight.
