@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:27
What’s it worth now? Arrogant jerk
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:28:15
This can’t be serious 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:55

Top dogs have made their quick profit and left
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:56:23
Yea wel that’s a better reason to quit then pretending you’re gonna be some sort of day trader

The arrogance on this sub is mind boggling considering you are talking about people life savings in some cases
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:38
Terrible advice here, there’s way more to consider than just 2 questions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:33:25
Lol it’s still dropping
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:11
Just wait, they’ll create their own. Banks weren’t gonna let this market go without their piece.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:11
With bills that regulate them which prevents a lot of criminals from doing those things 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:07
You are trolling right?
