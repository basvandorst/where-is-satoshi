Logic being: Bitcoin appreciation would not be taxed as an asset, and it would therefore be seen more as a currency. This would bring in more money for the government, and "tax evasion" would only exist in the hands of the merchant selling the good, not the citizen simply trying to use their digital currency.

This is like people criticizing Google for using too much power, when Google is improving efficiency in so many areas of life. 
In Bitcoin's case:
* How many trips were not taken to the local bank because somebody didn't need to cash a check? 
* How many cash-delivery trucks will be taken off the street? 
* How many inefficient brick-and-mortar bank branches will close because of Bitcoin? 
* How many massive banking buildings (look at the skyline of any major city) will close down because of Bitcoin? 
* How many lives will not be put into turmoil over an inflating currency (which has real costs)? 
* How many Target credit cards will not be stolen because of Bitcoin (the result of which is a massive cost to society)? 
* Or, how more efficiently will Bitcoin put money into the hands of people all around the world? 
* How much more quickly will the market be able to respond to changing conditions because the currency they use is internationally available, free-to-use and virtually unstoppable? 
* How much inefficiency is saved by cutting out the middlemen like PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, American Express?

We're getting there! Look at how fast ATMs are spreading. Let's not forget that Bitcoin ATMs didn't even *exist* until October 29, 2013, *less than a year ago!* ATMs are relatively cheap to produce and I'm expecting to see quite a bit of growth in the coming months and year.

The Euro has dropped 20% in the past few months. Major currencies have plummet all the time. It's entirely possible it could happen to Bitcoin but I would argue it's highly unlikely, given the use cases that exist (see the top comment in this thread) and the new ones that are emerging.

@_date: 2014-01-09 02:47:03
This is an excellent question. So, presumably, the problem has to do with if the campaigns don't meet their goals and the exchange rate fluctuates in the mean time. 
Some ideas:
1. Just give the money back in Bitcoin at the current exchange rate, fluctuations be damned. So, for example, I may put 0.2 BTC into a project but only receive 0.18 BTC back if the project were to fail while the BTC price went up. Personally, I'd be OK with this scenario. 
2. This one may be stupid, but couldn't you pay the money back in fiat, to a PayPal account? 
3. Or, do what foodler does: have people get credit on your site for depositing Bitcoin. That credit can then be used for crowd funding campaigns.

It's not that hard to not get screwed. a) Use reputable exchanges. b) Don't leave your money on any exchange. 
Instead of playing a game of whack-a-mole, teach people the above and problem solved. Otherwise, you're just subsidizing the wrong bad decision making. 
And, if people learn this (even the hard way), in the long run we'll all be rewarded when the superior platforms rise to the top, and the bad ones fall away.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:44:47
Sounds like another SCAM! Just kidding. Being a mod here must be tough. 
I posted to another commenter that I thought it silly to think you'd steal money, simply because you probably already made money hand-over-fist as an early adopter, regardless of the donations.

I think the FairTax, if you actually read about it, solves the regressive nature of it. It provides tax credits to compensate.
Right now, if you spend Bitcoin, you're required to calculate tax on the appreciation of your Bitcoin... Which makes it terribly difficult to treat like a currency.

Bitcoin is designed with this in mind. The dollars in your pocket can never be protected from theft. Central banks devalue those every day even if you hide them under your mattress.

No it means people will have access to stable capital for the first time in a long time. Some of them may choose to reinvest that into businesses. 
The thing's hurting the Brazilian government are the socialist policy of capital restrictions and a big helping of corruption.

Agreeing with Mike here. 
Isn't this a marginal concern? And can't it be considered a cost-of-doing business? Every miner around the world has to contend with a different set of variables (bandwidth, latency, power, cost-of-labor, and much more). Why is this concern any different?

The confirmations are propagated by the nodes, but discovered by the miners. The number of confirmations is simply how many of those "block races" have been won since a transaction was created.
Miners get the blocks ("the confirmations") and the nodes propagate them.


Running a node is not expensive at all. Very little electricity.

@_date: 2015-08-15 20:22:06
Get a node!
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:24:48
There are miners and there are nodes.
Nodes propagate and validate transactions across the network. For instance, if I spend money locally, my transaction will register with a node, which will then pass it on to other nodes until the entire network knows of the transaction.
Miners, on the other hand, ensure the scarcity bitcoin by running complicated mathematical problems. Miners are racing every 10 minutes to solve a math problem before anybody else on the planet. Whoever wins the race is rewarded with some bitcoin. 
When miners win the race, they then notify the nodes of their "win" and the nodes propagate the knowledge of the "win" in what is called a "block." 
Each block (or "win") contains not only the answer to the math problem, but also all transactions that occurred since the discovery of the last block (usually around 10 minutes). 
Does that help? 
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:20:25
It should show the USD price when you ask to buy BTC
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:16:58

Not entirely sure. We'd have to be more specific about what we mean in terms of "pass through". 
1. Transactions that contact this node first (before any other nodes). This would be really interesting to me.
2. Any transaction that passes through (this would be pretty easy, I bet)

The question is not whether crypto-currencies are a fad. They're not. I know this because the dark markets are not a fad and will never die. That's one guaranteed market segment. Not terribly big, necessarily, but it's a baseline. 
The question is whether Bitcoin is the one that will succeed. That's the more interesting question.

The mudslingers will always sling shit but there's nothing that can be done about that. I think people just have an aversion to not knowing what they don't know. In this case, they don't know what's being taken done and so their minds (and admittedly mine too) create horror stories about massive loads of censorship. I think it would go a long way to quell everyone's anxieties. Plus, there may be some stories that are in the gray area that still should be discussed (at least according to some). 
In other words, I think it's a compromise that shows good faith from those with the power (and doesn't sink to the level of the other side).

Those wars were local wars. The "people" (or neanderthals) fought and died in a way that the average citizen of the US doesn't experience.
They weren't sending hundreds of thousands of troops overseas for a decade. There weren't massive warships and massive bombers and top-of-the-line equipment costing untold amounts of money.  The people in the US are able to not engage in war in any way, yet still kill millions of people abroad.

I'm really not crazy about that kind of language with regards to Bitcoin. The OP is ranting that this community doesnt care. There's no real community here. I don't know you, I don't know the OP and neither you nor me or anybody else is likely to save his coins. Not saying it's not possible, but this is simply an informative news site, we're not banded together like some roving tribe. The message to be taken from Bitcoin is exactly the opposite of community: it's distrust of one another. If the OP had realized this he may not have put the entirety of his coins in the hands of completely anonymous strangers. I imagine the unhealthy sense of community (as he reveals in the title) made him feel comforted as if we would stand up for him, which we won't, and which we frankly can't.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:04:04

I don't think Bitcoin is the democratization of money, as said in the clip. Democracies are more top-down bodies, which put things (laws) into effect by vote. It's possible for 49% of a democracy to disagree yet still be subjugated by the majority. Bitcoin is not voted upon in any way, people merely choose to use it (or choose not to use it) and there is no voting.
Otherwise, great video and sorry for the nitpick!

Fair point. Though, when is Bitcoin not considered a scheme and a genuine currency? They would never call the Euro a currency scheme. The distinction seems rather arbitrary to me.

1. to devise a devious plan. To be shady or otherwise use intellectual power to deceive or carry out a plan for a personal interest. A plan with a twisted plot.
2. To plan to do something to get someones money, most often by cheating

Depends who you ask. Personally, I think it's risky but potentially could have a great upside. My reasoning: it's the first currency in existence that isn't subject to runaway inflation by national governments, it can also be moved freely around the world instantly. Even if it's never adopted as a legitimate currency, it will always be propped up by the black market, who loves it for the reasons I've mentioned and others (and that's a big market in of itself).

I'm still trusting them because a) 90% of their funds are in cold storage b) they have a great team who have done businesses before c) they're well-funded by other smart people who are probably trying to ensure their investment stays strong. I blame  their support backlog on very high demand they've been receiving. Hell, when PayPal first launched I believe they had a support backlog of over 100k messages at one point. The trick is going to be whether they can scale gracefully with the incredible demand they're getting, and will continue to get as the number one US exchange.

Comparing profitability of GPU mining isn't all that relevant, IMHO. For the same reason you wouldn't start a gold mining company and only use steam panning as your tool, you likewise wouldn't rely on introductory hardware (a single GPU in Litecoin's case) to give consistent long term profits. I guess short term profits are possible, but then it really comes down to the fundamentals of Bitcoin to Litecoin, to which I don't count this as one. 
Are there any other reasons why Litecoin is better than Bitcoin? How does the community compare? That's kind of what I'm basing my bet on Bitcoin for, the community. Seems like it's necessary for widespread adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:00:14
Exactly. There is no community here. There frankly cannot be a community. I don't know the OP, he doesn't know me, yet he's trying to beg this "community" to save him? OP needs to learn a healthy sense of distrust, otherwise he'll continue to get screwed and nobody here will help.

I'd consider doing smaller, incremental changes to the Qt project to start. Maybe replace some of the shitty icons to start, then take it from there.

I think people will retain some understanding of the fundamentals. 
Take for example the internet. It's widely adopted now and nobody *exactly* knows how it works, but it's pretty well understood that some sort of interconnected network exists between A and B. How that network works, exactly, is unclear to most. Or BitTorrent. Most everybody understands that it's distributed in nature compared to the old Napster model.

But if it were truly profitable, the sophisticated miners would surely have farms, each with hundreds if not thousands of off-the-shelf configurations, rendering your puny configuration insignificant. In fact, the more successful Litecoin becomes, the more likely this is to happen, no?
Edit: I guess I see your point, that there are billions of non-specific GPUs that could be put to work on Litecoin, while they could not be significant on the Bitcoin network. Still, there will be massive encroachment by the professional miners on a massive scale (assuming Litecoin really took off) that could make GPU mining likewise relatively unprofitable, just as with Bitcoin. I guess it all depends on the future... as most things do. ;)
Edit 2: I'll admit that Litecoin has its advantages, I just think at this point the advantages are a mute point (mining will cease in a hundred years or so, right?), and the only real thing that matters is the rate at which it spreads. 
Thanks for the discussion, maybe I'll crack open Litecoin again and try to figure out that mining thing. ;)
