I've watched a couple of videos, intro to bit coin sort of things which were very informative and I think I have a decent understanding of it.  However, while I see people are buying small parts of bit coin to use at various places that accept them, it is also a spec investment which is why I am considering buying a few.  In other words, I am not going to use them.  I will hold and sell them if they increase in value or lose my money if the concept goes back to being worth pennies on the dollar.  So what I am going to do is set up another wallet, which means account,( see at 50 I can still learn) :-) at coinbase and either keep the blockchain one to transfer and hold or check out breadwallet as mineforman suggested which would probably make me feel more comfortable.

Oh and thank you.

I think it would be great for you helpful informed people to set up a subreddit for bitcoin help.  I couldn't find one and apologize if there is already one there.  This would probably help newbies tremendously.  Many of you are so used to this that it comes naturally.  Those are the ones that should be calmly walking people like me, with just the basic knowledge of the concept, through the process of becoming active and I could refer others to that subreddit for assistance in the future. It seems most of you on this thread definitely have or sincerely tried to help (even if over my head).  Just a thought.

I bank with Chase, my brokerage account was set up by requesting one through the on line banking in two clicks.  If I want to buy Apple, I don't have to set up an account with Apple.  
This might be very successful but as a novice, it is possible its downfall is not being user friendly.  Ultimately it is in a holder of bitcoins best interest if someone like me, willing to pony up a few grand on something like this to add to my financial portfolio, is encouraged to do so by making it easier.  Thowahoymatie might know more about computer interfacing but he either doesn't own bitcoin or doesn't know a darn thing about market capitalization because making snarky comments won't make me want to buy these things.

My point exactly.

I find it confusing when I've already set up a wallet, go on to the next step to purchase and the home page wants me to set up a wallet before going further.  That is confusing and frustrating for anyone at any age.

At 50, I am pretty much as grown up as I am going to be.  I am not whining but seeking information which most people are more than happy to give and understand the process isn't an easy one and can be frustrating for the newbie.  But I think you need to be aware that while my particular transaction won't mean much, making it more appealing to my demographic is advantageous. Walking people through the process is advantageous, not being a dick is advantageous. Edit  Why I am even bothering with someone who has just been around for two weeks?  I should have looked earlier and would have ignored his nonsense.  Silly me.

Thank you.

Another person who doesn't understand why it is not advantageous to  be obnoxious to potential investors. I don't expect everyone here to have a degree in finance so you shouldn't expect people to have an understanding of something quite new.  If you own any bitcoin, you want me to buy this.  You want me to suggest to my parents to buy this , you want me to suggest to my friends to buy this.  None of us are particularly computer savvy but we have a little money to risk on something without being particularly hurt if it crashes.  For it to succeed, you need us.  That is basic intro to business stuff. It seems like most of you in this thread know that so please apologize if this comes across rude to any of you that are helping.  I do appreciate it.

More complicated than going on line to my brokerage account and ordering shares of Apple.  Not only do you have to jump through hoops, you than have to trust some random person to actually deliver after you've authorized a wire transfer.  Or am I missing something? 
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:14:01
I wasn't planning on using them at all actually.  I was just going to buy 3 or 4 on spec and hold them long term to see what happens.  Thanks for the advice.  I'll check them out.

1. Is there one centralized "wallet" or do different sellers use different ones?
2. Although the bitcoin is speculative, where do you buy these things where you know, without a doubt,  that they will be delivered to you?
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:13:53
I've spent a while researching these things and I am not convinced you are anything but extremely hopeful regarding this.  Most big institutions aren't going to get involved with a speculative bubble until it is widely accepted as a form of currency or medium of exchange.  Hence the extreme risk to investors.

TL/DR  You want me on that wall.  You need me on that wall.   :-)
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:11:19
I've seen it but thanks for trying to help. :-) I think it lost me after I set up a wallet in block chain per a recommendation to do so and went to coinbase with a recommendation to do so to purchase and was directed to set up a wallet. Did I screw up by using block chain and should have just set up it all with coinbase?  Is that even possible?
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:52:55
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:30:50
 Thank you. Block chain had me set up or assigned the following...  a password, a bit coin identifier number, a bit coin address, an alias and a secret phrase as well as mobile verification of transactions.  Is that enough?
