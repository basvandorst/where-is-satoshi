Crypto can only do three things. Go up, stay the same, or go down. Based on a statistical analysis of those three game outcomes, you have a 66% chance of winning. Because when you apply the same analysis to money in your bank account, the only outcome is down. 100% chance of losing. It doesn't matter WTF the price of bitcoin is, because it will  never be worth less than money, and that's why we buy it.

This video by [Andreas Antonopoulos]( explains why crypto-currency is a revolution.

If banks won't provide the services customers demand, then customers will go elsewhere sooner or later. It's not concerning to bitcoin at all, because crypto currencies aren't going away simply because a bank won't issue a debit card. In fact, the very reason crypto exists is because of the mistreatment of banking customers. It's banks who should be concerned about losing customers, and this nonsense only accelerates their problems. 
In the short term, the bank wins by making it harder for people to leave the garden, and therefore retaining customers. But people will keep getting news tidbits about crypto currency as years go on. As they say "the genie is out of the bottle" now. Eventually, the bug in their ear will force them to question why they can't buy this "dangerous fake money" that the bank won't let them have. And then they'll hit the next roadblock of trying to actually verify an exchange account. Once they make it through that hurdle, this disenfranchised banking customer will realize why the bank is irrelevant.

All matter is merely a slow vibration of energy and nothing is solid, so we never touch anything. I get it. Don't be "that guy" who gets technical like it invalidates my point. You know what I'm talking about.

Is bitcoin global?

**TL;DR [waves hand] Forget bitcoins. Smoke pot. Check your privilage**
Wow, what confuses me, is how someone who spends years doing all this research, has the balls to say *"It’s all the same stuff that people say about gold – another waste of human investment energy."* He doesn't even like precious metals. I mean, gold has actually been around for thousands of years. When is this guy going to legitimize it?
Gold, a waste of time? And just when you think he's said the dumbest thing, I present the very next sentence:


He didn't even read the first sentence of the white paper link he's attempting to use as a reference. 


It is wrong. If this guy believes what he just said, then he's all in on the war against terrorism. Strangling third world countries with sanctions and proxy wars for control over resources. My red flag went up when he mentioned tulip bulbs. I was hoping to get some insight into why I(we) might be wrong about bitcoin. But this guy is only hastening the turn to crypt-currencies through the broken policies of dollars backed by nothing. So, keep preaching about bubbles you fuckwad. This guy doesn't know anything about investing. It's almost like a robot assembled the story through a bunch of other semi-related stories on this topic.
Theguardian is clearly anti-cryptocurrency. Scroll down to the bottom and look at the other stories they offer. "Don't invest in bitcoins", Warren Buffet says it will "end badly", and "The Bitcoin Bubble". Oh, and no less than three feel-good stories about marijuana. Smoke pot people, and don't pay attention. Sleep.

If you haven't noticed, the internet is choking itself on memes. It's to the point where you spend 90% of your time sifting through all the bullshit, to find the one post which might contain real information. I understand your frustration though, and fully support it.

In the movie Trading Places, the speculation on the future of frozen concentrated orange juice is what bankrupted the Duke brothers. The thing is, there was an actual report which told them the quality of the orange harvest. Absolutely nobody knows what the value of bitcoin is based on. Futures are a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:29:15
Everyone on the bubble train fails to recognize bitcoin is simultaneously undervalued. Since absolutely nobody on the planet is able to determine what it's worth. $15,000 each is cheap.

Reddit does not seem like the proper place to get information. I've been trying to understand this for a few hours. And it's impossible to determine who actually knows what they're talking about. I think I'll just go to the source of Roger Ver, or Charlie Lees statements directly, and try to make my own determination of what they're talking about. Because the peanut gallery of commenters isn't making sense.

In paying a parking ticket, I once wrote "Blood sucking vampires" in the comment section. The teller drew a line through the comment, as if to cross it out. Like, that somehow made it right. I'm sure altering a check without having me initial it is illegal and I could've gotten her fired. But it wasn't worth the hassle.

Ignorance is no excuse. 


You didn't know your own level ignorance, until you Googled it? But you continue to make errors in an attempt to cover up and excuse your behavior. Hymie is not the same as Jamie at all, anywhere. Every dictionary you care to look it up in will specifically say it's derogatory. Hymie derived from Hyman (originally Chayyim or Chaim). No sir, I believe that "Hymie" was due to your ignorance. Your inability to admit it is disgusting.

I only have a rudimentary understanding of how China works. But even I know that the levels, upon levels, of bribery and corruption will keep the system going under the table until they create their own Chinese version of Bitcoin. As if those who run those giant mining operations are just going to turn off their computers and walk away? Yeah, sure.

Bribery. The power companies pay the local official enough to look the other way so they can continue mining.

There is no way to value bitcoin, in the short term, with any analysis that makes sense. Lots of smart people seem to know what they're talking about. However, there isn't a single person alive who really knows if $1 for 1btc is a scam, or $100,000 for 1btc is cheap. This is the only math you need to know: dollars in your bank account will only go down in value. Even if bitcoins stayed at the same price for the next 20yrs, it's still better than dollars. 


Yes, the scam is called Surviorship bias. So, take all the Peter Schiffs and Bernie Madoffs who "correctly predict the market" as lucky, until they're not lucky anymore.

It's pretty shameful to criticize others for their incorrect thinking, while openly resorting to anti-Semitic slurs. You couldn't even be clever enough to hide your hatred by using the guys proper name. Oh no, this is transparent "agenda" which was referring to in the other argument. Intentional or not, you should apologize for this action.

Buying something now is a good idea. You need to figure out the process. It's very complicated. I bought 3 months ago. It took me 5 days before I could figure it out, verify the paperwork, set up a trezor, etc. Do it now, so when the next crash happens, you will be ready.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:38:56
Crumbling? Video killed the radio star huh? I agree this is a shiny new thing we need to pay attention to because it exists. But, "The system" in place isn't going anywhere. We never get the future right.

China is corrupt. All they will have to do is bribe the local official to declare that all the bitcoin mining has stopped.

It's strange because someone can evaluate a balance sheet of Apple and justify it's price. There is nothing like that for bitcoins. The value of a bitcoin is between zero and infinity. There is no way to actually measure it.

There are a billion of them. And they just went through a program to receive national ID cards and bank accounts. That means, new customers for bitcoin.
