If you want to have a real "authentic" American game of monopoly have one player start the game with ALL the money in the bank and ownership of every property on the board.
And if other people don't want to play now tell them "theyre not poor they're just temporarily having financial problems" and 8f they really buckle down and pick themselves up by their bootstraps they can still win!
Then go on fox news and call the other players lazy.

I withdrew $300 from a bitcoin ATM the other day.  it went thru instantly, didn't have to wait for any conformations, and it only cost about $5-7 in fees.

since when is saving money a bad thing??
I mean christ.  people will buy the things they need; food, gas, electricity, water, etc.  and buy some things that they don't need but want like a night at the movies or a trip the an amusement park.
and then they will save the remaining money.  
what kind of economy/society do you live in that cannot function unless everyone lives paycheck to paycheck? spending every single dollar they have? otherwise "the gears of commerce to grind to a halt."????

wat?  I never said anything about a card, what are u talking about?
I walked up the the Bitcoin ATM, hit "sell bitcoin", scanned the QR code with my coinomi wallet on my phone and literally as soon as I pressed "SEND" the machine spit out three $100 bills.
there was a $5 fee for this service.

I would argue that the process of creating money is in fact "evil" in it's present form.

I'm sorry sir but you are wrong.
the FED is composed of PRIVATE banks and our elected officials (lime ron paul) can hardly get inside the place.
tell me what government agency the FED answers to and who holds it accountable?
the FED has loaned out TRILLIONS of dollars and has not had to even disclose who they gave this money to.

100k is pretty ridiculous.
but I think a bitcoin equaling the value of an oz. of gold could very easily become reality.
