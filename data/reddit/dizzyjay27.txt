Just looked it up. I really appreciate the advice, I’m definitely going to order one to try out. Cool man, thank you!

Dude I plan on having my now ten month old fluent in solidity by like 6 or 7 c++ alongside his grade 1 learning. Can we get a cryptography and coding knowledge base dapp please, for educating the future on exactly what’s going on here. Like let’s get the babies of today to be the bitgen of tomorrow.

Today maybe. But following the holidays when all these kids get their new phones and then have all this left over Christmas cash to spend. I know some of it’s coming our way.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:19:38
You’re dads awesome, but I’d take this post down eventually. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:16:17
I’m okay with that. I don’t believe bitcoin will get left behind though. It could be in tenth place for all I care. As long as people start trying to grasp what this technological milestone means to the future of the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:51:32
I’m 25 so technically no, but philosophically i would say, maybe. In regards to cryptocurrency I’d say toddler, in regards to understanding code i’d say still an embryo, does that take away my passion to learn? No.

For the same reason we support broken institutions like schools and church’s. It’s not for lack of a better option it’s because these things are built on the beliefs and foundations that society will benefit the only difference being that what we believe in in bitcoins Blockchain and it’s value as the pioneer is based on fundamental mathematics therefore unlike schools or churches who’s institutions can become defunct and centralized the infallibility of the distributed ledger is going to protect the core values satoshi had in mind when he released the white paper. In math we trust. Time will quash the uncertainty and the chain will run optimally, math, not faith, dictates this to be true.

Every bitcoin address has a public key aka a hash  of letters and numbers unique to you that people can send and receive btc from. You also should have a private key, a unique set of numbers and letters that your public key is derived from. Never share this private key, if your wallet doesn’t have one then you don’t have 100% control of your investment. If you do have one. Write it down on paper as neatly as physically possible and lock it away somewhere only you have access too. Every basic cryptocurrency will have something similar to this and if your wallet doesn’t feature this than you don’t actually own your btc they do so soak the transaction fee and get a good wallet for your currency. Like Jaxx or coinomi. Or just read the whitepaper like I said, satoshi nakamoto explains things pretty well.

Yeah dude. In the grand scheme of things this is windows98 give the community 3-5 years and we will have a whole new internet unlike anything we’ve ever seen give them 10 and you’ll see a whole world of changes. A few days for a transaction for what this will become is a worthy annoyance imo.

I meant cryptocurrency total market cap. Bitcoin is the poster child,Blockchain is the miracle. What happens to btc from here on out means little to me in comparison to what happens to Blockchain in regards to its eventual global adoption and its potential as a technology to decentralize and incentivize the whole planet. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:24:16
Not to mention keeping taxes on Blockchain means that they’d have to show us where they use those taxes. Let’s make the government officials required to keep all their work in office transparent and Blockchain verified. No more crony capitalism.

Depends how much you have to jump in with honestly. If you want your money to double btc has to hit 34k. I strongly suggest reading white papers and buying crypto you believe in rather than jumping in blind.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:10:26
Because I never invested more than I could lose and even with a dip like this I trust in the power of math.. I don’t believe people are happy with the way the system has bled out each of our countries In the debt economy we’ve all been living in regardless of landmass. This is a way for people to have p2p trust across continents in a matter of minutes. It’s so much more than just money though. It’s a way to hold everyone accountable. Schools governments infrastructure corporations. With Blockchain we can decentralize all the aspects of society that need to be transparent and honest. Again, in math we trust.

It’s not about the value of btc in regards to money dude. It’s what it meant to the world when it’s inception became known to the web. It’s about what it has started and can’t be stopped. It’s about the paths it opened up for people. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:56:26
Dumped my bcash for ether today might as well I don’t like the feel behind the devs at all. At least vitalik has a platform to run on. I’ll leave my btc alone until Blockchain is a world currency standard.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:28:20
Read the bitcoin whitepaper, read the ethereum white paper, read the doge whitepaper, grab some OG alts like those and hodl long. This is just the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:51:34
Formal to informal? So distribute wealth from the rich to the poor. Classism at its finest. I bet the douche who wrote this fine piece of Citibank propaganda, has never had ichiban noodles or bread for dinner in his life. Keep up the rhetoric, is millennial “good for nothing’s” have a lot more to prove than you think. Let’s continue the redistribution of wealth and hodl till it means something. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:46:05
I got a little bcash in my wallet 80$ or so so I used it to buy ethereum at this nice low that’s diversifying.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:25:29
Wow, I’ve been waiting for a platform to learn more on the subject and a simpler way to teach my infant as he grows. Thanks op!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:59:00
This post actually made my day xD
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:51:46
I personally am an ethereum dominant hodler. The internet machine. But non the less bitcoin is the poster child holding a bit will never be a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:13:28
Also with exchanges trying to make trading alts more convenient even if btc becomes just a store of value used for major financial decisions I can still go onto an exchange with ethereum and invest in a project I support and potentially still make those gains. Btc is the beginning but the true scope and potential of crypto has yet to even be thought of. It’s like an infant becoming a toddler we have many years before we truly know how important it will be to daily life. It’s like Facebook 2009 ppl knew about it but it wasn’t used by everybody everyday yet. The only difference is that with btc one company doesn’t make all the money. The wealth is distributed. In math we trust.

Flood these guys with calls. Flood their website with too much traffic and make them see that they are on the wrong side of the future.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:41:07
Kids and average joes are what started making bitcoin a thing. People who had knowledge and a little bit of luck made the system last to get to this point. Don’t underestimate the masses.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:09:20
Bitcoin being the standard probably. “Can i get a lager” “that’ll be five satoshis please.We accept almost any cryptocurrency, the total sum of 5 Satoshis” *cointranslator kicks in and decides what the cheapest way to produce those satoshis is and ur phone activates its hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:06:57
Because youre buying a product, the product being the future of currency. You ahouldnt even be thinking like that at all if you knew even a single thing about decentralized ledgers.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:46:39
What setvice might that be, monero? Like how do we direct deposit our fiat payments direct deposited into our btc/cryptowallets 
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:43:53
Its a distributed ledger we can create an unhackable transparent and virtually global internation internet of value. It makes our fiat debt based 1% controlled oil ridden world a little more in our control, bitcoin makes the world more bearable. Steemit the most for me though.
