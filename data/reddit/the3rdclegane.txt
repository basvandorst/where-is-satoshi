okay, you know we could talk for hours on this :P so I'll give a few examples. Many people rightly say 'altcoins success is currently tied to bitcoins', so if bitcoin falls the altcoins will struggle. So imagine all those multi billion/multi trillion industries that are being disrupted by altcoins. Alt coins and bitcoin have countless, powerful enemies. IS it really inconceivable to see those enemies sabotaging bitcoin in order to get to the alt coins??
With the option to short, there's plenty of people now capable of making money off the sabotage of their competitors, seems like a common sense move to me.
There's thousands of theoreticals, its wise to consider as many as possible: good and bad. You can't just live in a biased fairyland.

Is it FUD if it's a genuine possibility? Wouldn't your collective denial of risk be exactly that: denial? :P Wall Street will be managing their risk quite well, it's a shame you guys are too incompetent to do the same

those damn crypto kitties. BTC's still got a hold of the exchange markets along with ETH, and rthanks to those kitties clogging the ETH network, BTC and tether get the Lion's share

Risk to your investment, and all other ordinary bitcoin hodlers. It's a fairly straightforward definition :s
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:13:32
I didn't :p called it though back in September! Just didn't have the balls to risk it. But you guys have to admit, you're playing with fire
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:34:18
i admire the belief, and if you're in profit then great! But it's this blind belief that I'm talking about. You don't win a game of chess with only belief
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:40:59
Well, all the best :p 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:22:04
I was ranting, it's not your fault and I genuinely hope you all don't get screwed by those money grabbing fucks. I read through the main feed and it shocks me that people aren't discussing the risks. And I don't mean FUD, take emotion out and simply calculate the risks. 
At the end of the day, if bitcoin gets hammered it's you guys that will bear the brunt of the losses, a monumental transfer of wealth from the many to the few, something I really DO NOT want to see happen
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:28:17
I hope you're right about the price rise, but its the concentration of supply in the hands of these privileged few that should pose a fundamental risk. I want bitcoin to succeed as a store of value, but you guys are the guinea pigs in this experiment. And it's your money that's being risked. I just want to see you guys actually discussing risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:05:51
now that's good information! So unless there was a big hype for bitcoin, and therefore a high demand for long bets, then people couldn't short bet.
There's ways around regulations and laws for people with enough sway, don't be so naive :P
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:18:47
fair. I'll just ask next time, thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:40:02
No it's baiting to start a genuine conversation, if you look through my replies to others you'll see how very wrong you are
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:32:38
Fair, well at least you've done your due diligence and you're confident. That's more than can be said for 90+% of subscribers
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:14:35
It's provocative, sure, but are you really going to deny the risk? It's a serious fucking risk getting in bed with wall Street
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:02
indeed, fair points :) tomorrow is the first day, ground zero. I'm excited and nervous...
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:32
fair, wishing you all the best matey! Watching $billions enter and leave the market all day. Tomorrow is going to be interesting, the next few weeks/months are going to be a ride!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:39:50
fair yeah, they'll be taking crypto research/investing to new levels. And to be fair i agree, the money makers won't kill a golden goose, but there's people/groups out there that want more than money: Power, influence, dominance. And if bitcoin ever gets in the way of global agendas, all of sudden (and this is the point I'm making) they can profit from harming their competitor.
Perhaps I'm going too deep into conspiracy! Hey thanks for not calling me dumb, a troll or anything like that. Greatly appreciated
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:36
indeed, fair play to you guys if this works out well
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:31:09
The genuine, and very real risk that bitcoin could get shorted to fuck in the coming months, especially if investors decide an alt coin has more potential. Short on the futures market, dump on the actual market. How do you not see that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:00:01
me too, and I'm not even invested in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:18:36
Wall Street has already been here? What do you think a derivatives market is for?! It's so accredited investors, like those on wall Street, can properly hedge their bets. Not only that, they can legally and legitimately make millions, if not billions, from bitcoin failing. How does that risk not compute for you guys??
Don't mistake me for someone who wants bitcoin to fail, I'm in alt coins and they currently depend on bitcoins success, but bitcoins future can and will be manipulated (further) with this derivatives market. And if bitcoin collapses it's you, not the top 0.1%, who will bear the brunt of the losses.
Tell me you've at least considered the risk
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:39:17
Do you? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:22:02
Alts have more solid use cases: smart contracts, cross border payments, decentralised storage. Although Bitcoin is a store of value, if the price is too volatile then who in their right mind will use it like gold? They'll just buy gold.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:36:52
And I get their greed, I'm hoping it will fuel the entire crypto world, but it's that same greed that has no attachment to anything except profit, and this advancement just gives those profit makers more options to cream us all. They have no loyalty, and if the day comes and they do decide to short, jump ship and move to another crypto, let's say ETH... Well that's jack shit anyone can do, the price could drop 40% in a day with a mass transfer to fiat and alt coins, all the while those greedy money makers have made billions.
I do see both sides though, and I hope for the best. But we all know how dangerous hope can be

Cardano will be Quantum resistant. Buy that instead if you're worried
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:25:51
As much as I don't like Bitcoin, this is fantastic :)

We're already ahead of this timeline. We're almost at 2020 prices
