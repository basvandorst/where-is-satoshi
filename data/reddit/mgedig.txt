The current B logo looks like a kids drawing... We do need something better, and sooner than later. There was some talk of a variation of the Thai Bhat? I reckon that needs to be re-discussed

Ok, so I just read everything in this thread and I don't even know how to code....  I'm a filmmaker who likes a little bit of tech. A little bit. 
1-The guy is young, he decided to make a bitcoin exchange... Give him a break he's obviously quite the proactive student. Yes he has a lot of people's money etc, but who's regulating anyway
2 - you could, with all the knowledge I can see between you, maybe, give him some of this advice? (DISCLAIMER: I have money in this exchange... I won't explain why in too much detail. Something to do with the fact that it had no trade lag while others did during the big crash, along with a couple other points that seemed to make sense at the time of the move) 
3 - bots. Yes. This site had at least one very busy bot. Lots of small orders, all the time. It was very difficult and needs fixing. Gox seems to be in the same boat. My take on it is some excited Germans got maliciously involved in bitcoin24 and made some bots and made some money for a while. Then they realised they could make some more code/break some more code and hacked it yesterday through the gaping holes they'd discovered during their time there... Now Simon is trying to make amends and learn his lesson very quickly. When he has 7 years + experience he'll probably be very good at what he does. Right now, unfortunately, he still likes sponge bob, and needs some help. 
Is this scary? Yes. But we all live and learn. Especially me... I'll be excitedly waiting sites like buttercoin (or whatever it ends up being called) and the like while I pray for my money back. 
If you do have the time, maybe via the facebook, or the original link of this thread, or the forums, maybe drop him a line and give him a piece of advice or 2.
Thanks for reading

OK I strongly think it should have some kind of relation to the Internet, or networks. Considering virtual currencies, or digital currencies are the currencies of the future and they wouldn't be possible without the internet - this is what I think you should look at centering the name around. 
International Network Bank
WebBank (not sure about this "b")
some brainstorming there but maybe there is something better out there. 
Considering you will be the first of it's kind it's important you get yourself a name that can ring true for it's future potential

the site adds liquidity.
burnside sounds like he has a good "should I get hit by a bus" procedure.

Have a look at this guide if you would like to use my referral link - the OP and poster above are onto something, it took me 24 hours to transfer money and very cheap:
You get one free transfer with my referral link, let's be transparent about this guys......! and if you contact me directly after a successful transfer I will share 5% of the referral fee with you via bitcoin tip - but not like bitcoin billionaire did :)   ....+bitcointip!

brainstormed "Digibank" - I like this and don't in equal measure :)
has a nice ring to it but not sure what the meaning is imbedded that is turning me off

yeah this wasn't ideal...
why should we feel safe? "because you can read the code and write your own etc..." yeah ok... I feel much safer now because I don't know how to read or write code. 
you should feel safe because the underlying system is open source and experts have reviewed the code in depth as well as attempted to compromise it and failed. While there have been security issues with the surrounding ecosystem (maybe elaborate), there are a variety of tools under development that should make it safe and easy for the average user in the future.... SIMPLE ANSWER
"underground", eco-political rants... not a good look on big news channels.
Depends on how you see the future of bitcoin though I guess.

please can I have BTC back instead of euros?
I sold my BTC for around €55 - close to the price as I write...
I would prefer BTC back as I don't want to wait for the bank account to be opened forever!

bah, my brainstorm suddenly seems pathetic :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:06:20
thanks :)
yes the method is inspired by a previous post, I rewrote the guide to make it a simpler read!

be aware - we don't know what BBC's spin is on this yet... not all press is good press.
Miners + "do any exist in California with our high electricity costs?"... climate change themes perhaps? (not that I'm disagreeing with the enourmous issue that climate change is, just think we should keep things in perspective. The economy is just as big a problem and the relative power consumption of miners is not so great)
... my brother was once interviewed for a graffiti documentary for Channel 4 in the UK - he was painted to be a mindless vandal and my mother a naive idiot... 
My brother is now at the Royal Academy (one of the most esteemed art colleges in the UK) with a 3 year scholarship. EDIT and my mother is not a naive idiot.
But news/TV will do anything for a story and put their spin on it.
I hope the BBC stays objective as I do like most of their/your programs.

he needs to fix a lot of things, I know everyone wants their bitcoins back etc, but give him a chance... he also needs to fix the broken engine and roll back transactions - seems right now the priority for him is to act on the bank issue as our fiat money will be locked for at least 3 months.
THAT comes first, then when has fixed that he can worry about the engine and the bitcoins. 
If he had someone else to help with the site things would be different. But it seems he doesn't... THIS is the situation we are all in

other "money" does not have a payment system as part of it's package for one...
bitcoin cannot exist without the blockchain... money can exist without the various payment systems as you can just simply hand cash over...
tell me if I'm wrong but this is my understanding of the difference.
A bitCOIN is the representation of a unit of money, but bitcoin as a whole is not just money in the traditional sense
I could go on but I'm sure others can explain this difference better than I

Best post I read on here since these shenanigans began

ok, my exit strategy is non existent. I'm all in. 
I've basically written off my investment mentally (as much as I can)... if it succeeds it will do very well, if it doesn't, well I will exit as fast as I can if such event happens. 
The problem with the way news affects bitcoin is precisely that, the way news affects bitcoin. People jump all over the place. I doubt Bitcoin will die overnight, every dip has a bounce somewhere. 
But yes, I need to allow myself over 24 hours to exit as BTC TC does not allow large withdrawals over about 5-6 BTC at the moment. 
At this stage with bitcoin another risk is another risk is another risk. How many can you count that would be very unlucky if they actually materialised. 
On the other hand, how much more can you gain by investing in ASICMINER - this calculation has more substance. 
My concerns would be, if the price did skyrocket for BTC, how many shareholders will want to cash out their shares in order to sell BTC on the market, thus driving the price down for the shares. 
Anyway I'm not really versed in finance, weighing up risk etc, I'm just going with my gut... plus it feels healthy to invest back into the community rather than just hoard the coins I bought.

I also transferred on transferwise and using the same day option (and paying an extra £10 or so from UK) I sent it in late morning and it was in my bitstamp by late evening... just in time to buy in at $235 USD... heh
My referral link here if you want it, you get one free transfer with it -

I trust BTC TC as much as I trust bitcoin itself...
if you are taking the risk being involved in this new technology and putting fiat into it, I don't see what the extra hurdle is buying PT shares.
Burnside and Friedcat both seem on the ball...
comments welcomed to the contrary
