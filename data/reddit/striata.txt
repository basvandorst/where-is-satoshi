Wait, so, hypothetically, if you could somehow DoS the peer at the other end of your channel and ensure that they are offline for the duration of the cool down, you could potentially steal some of their money without possible ramifications?

Working as intended :-)

Oh I agree. The fees are terrible

No it's just arbitrary ranges. For your transaction, you'll have to wait at least 9 hours before your it is confirmed. Probably quite a bit longer depending on the growth of the mempool.

Right, I mentioned that.


My point is, this is practically useless until these hubs start appearing.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:41:02
I see, thanks.

This is true only if your counterparty is actually connected to the rest of the network, either through a central hub/router or by virtue of being the central hub/router.
The network will tend towards a centralized structure for similar reasons that the internet infrastructure is centralized through Tier 1 network providers such as Level 3, Telia, etc. 
Having many open channels as a hub will require an inordinate amount of resources (bitcoin, or bandwidth for the ISP analogy), as the hub will need to lock a reasonable amount of bitcoin  in channels with other nodes that they want to connect to in order for the transactions to actually happen off-chain.

That is routing. It's also centralization.

Yep, the guy in the OP didn't even read the thread that is supposedly a shill attempt.

Why do you need to wait 100 blocks before selling?

In order to create a Lightning channel, you essentially "lock" an amount of Bitcoin. 
In the demo linked, the user locked 16.000.000 satoshi (0.16 BTC ≈ 650 USD) in the channel. These bitcoin can not be used for any other purpose than sending or receiving money from the other party until the channel is closed again. Both opening and closing a channel is a transaction on the blockchain and will cost you a transaction fee. I assume this fee is also larger due to the increased complexity (smart contracts) of the transactions that are broadcast to the blockchain.
The result is, you cannot willy nilly be opening lightning channels to any merchant you want unless you have a lot of money spare to fund these channels.
If you lock a smaller amount, you have to keep closing and re-opening channels after you have spent the locked amount, which will be expensive in terms of fees.
Why would you want to lock money in a channel with a single merchant (such as Bitrefill)? You'd probably be better off making a single large refill/purchase for the whole amount in a single bitcoin transaction than making multiple small transactions in a Lightning channel. For it to be "worth it", you have to lock an amount that will cover at -least- a handful smaller transactions.
What Lightning needs to be usable are centralized payment processors, with open channels to merchants.

Can you not see how dangerous this could potentially be, and what legal precedent you would be setting? Saying that means that blockchain becomes a free haven for illegal content to be published and distributed, without fear of prosecution. It literally gives anyone a "get out of jail" card for possessing illegal material on their computer:
_"Oh, I had no idea that stuff was in there! I just run a Bitcoin node to support the network!"_
This is the legal can of worms that I am referring to. It's not just about the immutability of the network.
I don't think there is an existing system to compare this to. Not the internet, nor the Bittorrent protocol. In both cases, you actually have to actively look up the content that you are downloading or distributing, and thus displaying some form of intent to distribute or consume the illegal content.
In my linked post, I also mention the interesting implications this will have to the new EU regulations, the GDPR, about what personal information companies are allowed to store about EU residents.
My main point is that I think threads like these puts the Bitcoin community in a bad light when they are so quick to dismiss this as conspiratorial FUD, without thinking of the actual legal issues this might cause in the future and what their solutions might be.

Ah, so I assume you also intend to create and distribute infinite variations of the "blockchain viewer" software as well?


That is why the blockchain storage format would have a magic byte to denote the start of a stored file, and include metadata such as the file type.
This is in any case an irrelevant digression.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:03:15
Say you have a piece of illegal video that requires some obscure video codex (DivX?) to decode and view, does that mean that storing and distributing said video file is okay because  the proper tool to view it is not readily available?
This may already exist, but somebody can easily create a format for storing files in the Bitcoin blockchain (e.g. a special byte sequence to look for in the transaction metadata that denotes that this is the beginning of a stored file), and then reconstruct the complete file by combining the transactions it consists of in a special "blockchain viewer" program. It could be pictures or any other file format.
Bam. There you go. Easily accessible content stored in the Bitcoin Blockchain with no external metadata required.

Nor is it AMAT. That was my point.

Do you realize how ridiculous you sound?
Here is the NASDAQ stock index in the period 1994 to 2004, during and after the dotcom bubble:
Using highly advanced financial analysis tools, we can superimpose Bitcoin's price development:
As you can see, it is a perfect fit. Hand in glove. Foot in shoe. With this, we can predict with absolute certainty that we have reached the peak of the Bitcoin bubble. As such, the only reasonable action right now is to sell.

files with sexual content. While five files only show, describe, or link to mildly
pornographic content, we consider the remaining three instances objectionable
for almost all jurisdictions: Two of them are backups of link lists to child pornography,
containing 274 links to websites, 142 of which refer to Tor hidden services.
The remaining instance is an image depicting mild nudity of a young woman.
In an online forum this image is claimed to show child pornography, albeit this
claim cannot be verified (due to ethical concerns we refrain from providing a citation).
This seems to suggest that at one of the eight instances of pornographic content was an image stored directly in the blockchain, perhaps over many transactions? I don't know any more details than the paper provides.
In any case, whether or not any questionable content exists embedded in the blockchain today is not really relevant. What's interesting are the legal issues that arise from the fact that you are able to store arbitrary, immutable content in the Blockchain.
Authorities can't ignore it, and they can't remove it, so what can they do?

I don't understand this counterattack. I am proposing to create  a standardized format for embedding data into the blockchain.
People would use a suitable viewer that supports that format to easily identify transaction groups where data is stored.
How does introducing "endless formats" attack this approach?

Your post starts out reasonable, and then just devolves into nonsensical drivel comparing blockchain to the internet like everyone else on reddit with their heads buried far into the sand. [If you don't realise what legal can of worms this potentially is, you are deluded.](
It "resurfaced" because researchers released a new report, and people are writing about said report. This time, as opposed to previously, concrete examples of embedded imagery was found through their analysis.
