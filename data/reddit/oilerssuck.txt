I hope so, this place is in a rough neighborhood.

Alright, update time....
Picked it up, and there looks to be something written on it, under the black paint that's on the back of it.  Can't quite decipher what it is though, although it looks more like random characters and not just numbers.  Shows up better under a black light, but Im going to see if I can use some paint thinner to rub a little bit of the black paint off one of the clearer letters and see if anything shows up.
Also measured things properly, and its 14 inch by 4.5 inch and its 3/4inch thick, weighs 9.7lbs (35.5cm x 11.5cm x 1.9cm and 4.4kg)

Some of it looked like it had band saw markings and some plasma cutter, but not really sure.

As far as I know, the previous owner of the house wasn't the Quadriga guy who died, but I'll see tomorrow if there's anything hidden or engraved with it.

lol, didn't think anyone cared still.... anyway, I haven't gotten around to using paint thinner on it.  Im reasonably sure of at least 3 letters that are on the back of it, they seem to show up a little better when under black light, although they aren't luminescent.  There's at least 5 letters in total that seem to be there.... There's also a couple of letters that seem to be hidden in the in the saw marks, that don't seem to be random.  Not sure that there's really enough to decipher a seed phrase or anything though.
