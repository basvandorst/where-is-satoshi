Great, added you to the gmail chat thingy (dk.vali we could even do a voice chat over it or on skype if you'll be up for it. In case you're not using the chat, will probably drop you an email in a few weeks tops. Just to make myself clear, my project is not yet world wide popular, just got a working prototype in December actually, need the funding to take the project further, anyway, it has huge potential to become the chess of the future if done somewhat right and money goes a long way for me. I've been looking at btc related crowd funding websites and yours seems the most promising. Tried adding the project a few days ago but ended in a 502 error page I think, but I'm sure that will be fixed soon if it hasn't been already. You or someone else should add this to the wiki perhaps, the more links pointing to the website, the better

If there isn't stuff to use bitcoin for, then it's a bubble scam and only some traders and early adopters will make some money off it, which is not cool since it's meant to be a coin at most. It's not a company making actual stuff. Beware of scammers, hording and greed.
That being said... I have an open source game project that can make bitcoins world wide popular, especially among teenagers, but not limited to.
I have to undergo a surgery in near future, but I'll give this website a go after that.
