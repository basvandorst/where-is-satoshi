Rand only hated libertarianism because she thought they plagiarized her ideas.
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:57:48
Well, try harder. If her work is too much to handle that's fine, just try to avoid asserting opinions on subjects you don't know anything about. You may end up discouraging people from exploring a great writer.

It's so considerate of them, when you think about it. No matter how much you make they will scale the thievery so that everyone gets to just keep their head above water. Such nice thugs.

My refund was $-1200, so instead of new tires on my car I'll drive to the cheapest dentist in a less safe car, on roads paid for by property and gas tax. Have you ever been to the cheapest dentist? It doesn't matter how many certifications he has, it *is* Russian Roulette. 
But yes, I will continue posting to the internet, all of which will be recorded and categorized by the largest spy agency in the world, even the private conversations, without warrant or reason. Lets not forget, that database will also contain a detailed history of my geographical location through cell signals, plate scanners, and facial recognition. I will keep posting, for now anyway, for as long as we can keep fighting their attempts to censor free speech online. And, that's what I am really getting for my money isn't it. All of your examples of what the government does for me are paid for by something other than the income tax, or they make up such a small percentage of it that it isn't even worth mentioning. The lions share of my taxes go to programs of control, imprisonment, and war. 
You seem pretty well attached to the teat, but are you really going to argue that the 50 million government agencies, all making rules and regulations in the name of my "safety", have a net positive effect on our lives? Do you have any idea how much innovation is stifled by bureaucracy? Clearly not.
If 100% of my income tax went to science funding you would get no complaints from me. The tax bill would be way smaller, and science is something I'm happy to pay for. But, I would still argue to the death for the right of people to not be, at the threat of kidnapping or murder, forced to pay against their will.
If a product is worth the cost, you don't need a gun to make people buy it.
You want to know more about how the government irreparably harmed my life? I am not free, that's how. 
So please, why don't you tell me more about how you've been successfully brainwashed into thinking that groups of ordinary people know better about what's good for you.

This is awesome, I live right down the street and love the store. They will see some of my bitcoin this weekend.

There is a big difference between assuming I am owed "jack shit" and believing it is unreasonable to be kidnapped and caged for wanting to keep what is mine. When the government steals my money they are stealing the life I spent earning it. Life is much too short to begin with, so yes, I have a massive fucking problem with huge quantities of it being taken from me with next to nothing in return. 
The many thousands of dollars the IRS took from me last year would have made a huge difference in my quality of life. I could have worked less, or saved more, or traveled, or gone to the dentist, etc. I could have done all of those things with the amount of money stolen from me. Yet, the answer is always the same from nanny state loving fools like yourself. I should just suck it up and spend more life, and more energy on the most wasteful entity in the history of mankind and be thankful for the privilege. After all, everyone knows how the product of my life should be spent better than me, *right*?

On the Buy Honey page, just under "Honey gone hard?", you have written "All natural honey will crystallize time time."
This should be corrected to "All natural honey will crystallize time^2 ."

Just to be clear, I'm not a Rand zealot, and Rand wouldn't have called me an objectivist. But, I have learned much from her philosophy and I am a fan of her books so I have to argue a few of your points.
**Spoilers for The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged below.**
Roark does not rape Dominique in The Fountainhead. It's a bit subtle to some people, but Dominique breaks some shit in her house so that she can have a reason to call Roark over. Roark, being a craftsman immediately sees that the damage was intentional and gets the drift. The sex is rough because she's a freak. 
Many of Rand's heroes have flaws, but they are the flaws of men doing the best they can to live moral lives. Such as, Hank's desire to kick the shit out of Francisco, and pretty much everyone disagrees with Ragnar's methods, or Hank and Dagny's inability to let go of the life that is killing them.
I also wouldn't call the antagonists pathetic. Some of them are, but a few of them are very calculated people. Read it again and notice the astonishing similarities to real live villains in positions of power today.
Her main characters do not destroy the world to help it, they let the world destroy itself and GTFO before they are consumed along with everything else.
Finally, I would say that her philosophy can be boiled down to a few basic principles.
1. Use reason.
2. Be responsible for your own life.
3. Don't initiate the use of force.
I am not sure why you think those ideas are incompatible with "the real world" but the alternatives tried so far ultimately lead to the same thing; some people (usually the productive) will be sacrificed for others (usually the less productive).

Actually I would probably say, "Hey, that doesn't matter, it *is* a science fiction book." But, no, you're right. I hate everything Asimov ever wrote for the same exact reasons. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:54:58
Please point out where my argument is black and white, or where I say the government is 100% bad. I am arguing that the income tax is bad, that it is wrong. There is some good that government can accomplish, you won't find many libertarians against contract enforcement. But, the good that governments can accomplish is limited, which is why we are supposed to have a limited government. 
You don't like that I implied you are "on the teat". Take a look at how you implied multiple times that anyone who would disagree with you must be the kind of ignorant redneck who would have the particular speech affect of saying "gubbmint".
Every libertarian I've ever met knows that the state and the market are part of the same structure, we call it crony-capitalism and it is the result of the government "saving capitalism from itself". Don't worry, I'm never going to get my way. The lack of separation between economy and state will continue and all of us will get to enjoy laws from politicians bought by the highest bidder.

You wont find a hater of Rand that has a rational argument against her ideas. It's a one-in-a-million shot to find one who has even read her work.

This is overpriced. All of this has been possible for years with [this $12 adapter]( from Amazon and with [this $5 app]( from the Play Store. I'm always happy to see another company taking bitcoin, but this is way overpriced for what you get.

Flying has been my dream for my whole life, and I live in LA. I am very excited about this. Now, just as soon as bitcoin hits 10,000, I'll sign up for sure.

What is the recommended software for decrypting the .pdf file?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:41:44
Mycelium is my favorite android wallet. It's very easy to make encrypted backups to PDF and easy to import paper wallets and backups. I also use coinbase to buy coins as needed, the android app is easy to use. Once you are set up for instant buy you can get coins at the push of a button.

Nice website. I can't ever seem to get enough Sci-Fi, so I'll throw a few mBTC your way. Keep up the good work.

Yes. Sure, I made a mistake and a single transaction put my account $20 under. The bank rearranged the order of transactions from the previous 5 days, highest to lowest, and instead of 1 overdraft fee of $35 (fair) they charged me over $1000 in fees (scumbags). At the time I was living paycheck to paycheck and I never recovered from that hit. I spent months trying to bring my account into the positive. The bank managers would not work with me, they just kept adding fees. I watched paycheck after paycheck get deposited and swollowed whole. Altogether I lost over $5000 dollars to them. Once I realized I would never win the game I walked away $700 in the negative and went without a bank for 5 years. If you think that business practice is fair, or that it's my fault, you're crazy.

Check out Private Internet Access. They take bitcoin, allow anonymous sign up, use IP sharing, and don't keep any logs.

I just opened a CB account two weeks ago, I bought a few BTC and, after the 4 day wait, transferred the coins to my personal wallet without any delay or issues. I hope this issue resolves itself for you, but the site has been great for me.
