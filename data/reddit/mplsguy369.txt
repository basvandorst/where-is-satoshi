As described by Pieter Wuille[8] the 1-of-N scheme is particularly useful for constructing honeypots. The desire is to put a large bounty on a server, larger than the value of the server itself so that if the server is compromised it is highly likely that the hacker will claim the bitcoin, thereby revealing the intrusion. However if there are many servers, e.g. 1,000, it becomes excessively expensive to lock up separate bounties for each server. It would be desireable if the same bounty was shared across multiple servers in such a way that the spend would reveal which server was compromised.
This is accomplished by generating 1,000 different keys, building a hash tree of these public keys, and placing each key and associated Merkle path on separate servers. When the honeypot is claimed, the (previous) owner of the coins can tell which server was compromised from the key and path used to claim the funds.

TD Ameritrade customers who have at least 25K USD will have access to CBOE Futures (NOT CME) on Monday. Customers will be required to post margin (probably in USD). CME futures may be added at a later date when TD Ameritrade feels like it is "safe" to do so.

"Furthermore, these types (MAST) of “either/or” constructs could, with P2SH, only be unlocked by ultimately publishing all of the scripts — not just the one used. This makes for big transactions, data-wise, and for expensive transactions, fee-wise. By only requiring users to include the script that is actually used in the end, **MAST improves scalability**. It reduces the amount of data that must be transmitted, validated and stored by all nodes on the network."

They are in the business of selling electricity.  They have a relative advantage of access to cheap power.

You have falsely concluded that  having a relative advantage in an area means that using that relative advantage is the most profitable way to operate. That is false.

You don't understand futures markets, you don't understand how they operate and the relationship to the underlying asset. Because you lack knowledge and understanding in this area, your opinion has zero value. 
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

This isn't just betting, this instrument is settled against the BRR, which is driven by other exchanges, including GDAX, Kraken, ect.... This is not just betting

paying 15 - 25% of your gains towards capital gains tax still nets you more than giving away 100% of your gains... Like spending dollars to save pennies.

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:32:03
It will not drop to spot, it will always run above spot, due to the friction of actually owning bitcoin and the lack of bitcoin options for tax advantaged vehicles like a roth

Back up, mycelium entropy doesn't do anything to secure a printer... Printing on a compromised printer with mycelium entropy will still expose you. This isn't an invisibility cloak for you and your friends to sneak out and roam the school grounds with. The only thing that is secure with mycelium entropy its' method for generating keys. The printer itself could easily still capture every "print." Further more, "any modern printer" with a USB port is likely to be compromised

I didn't read the article, but Bitcoin could be useful in  a proof of solvency exercise. Insurance companies are required to hold cash as reserves, and huge amounts are spent on accounting for this cash reserve. Lots of accountants
