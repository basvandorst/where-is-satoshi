Nobody is stopping you from creating a Bitcoin client that does this, in fact this isn't a bad idea necessarily (if you truly believe forks will never be "deep" enough to cross into ancient history) but you are right that UXTOs make this more complicated, plus there are really very few performance benefits for doing this (because if you want higher performance you can just use an SPV wallet that offers a more compelling performance/security tradeoff)
The only reason why you'd want to create a client that works this way is because you want more people to run "full nodes" that currently run SPV nodes (but of course the definition of "full" is weakened the less of the chain you are validating)

It's simple: As long as Germany isn't in a horrible recession of its own, they will continue to bail Greece out and the status quo will continue. Germany will kick and scream and threaten to pull the rug out from under Greece (in order to get any austerity concessions it can) but at the last minute they will bail them out again.

Greece is a lost cause for Bitcoins: If there are capital controls on Monday, Greeks won't be able to withdraw their money to convert it into Bitcoins.
However, people in Spain and Portugal that see what's happening might decide to buy bitcoins BEFORE capital controls are put in place, since they are going to see their potential future play out in Greece...

In a way this is a semantic argument as to what the confines are of the "script" when you say "the script is Turing complete". Yes, clearly if you invent new complicated rules for how scripts can be chained together (which is what Wright is doing here) you can hide Turing completeness in these new rules.
But that seems like kind of an obvious and uninteresting argument. There real question is "Can you run USEFUL programs this way?" Whether they are Turing complete or not is less relevant than you'd think: Most canonical ethereum contracts don't have any loops, anyway.
Also: Arguing that something is "more optimized" when ethereum can run code every 15 seconds (soon every 4 seconds) as opposed to every 10 minutes PER LOOP ITERATION in Wright's Bitcoin scheme isn't really that remarkable either, regardless of the argument for "Native Extensions"
(BTW- You could still implement native extensions on top of the current ethereum protocol if you really had your heart set on it... just because it isn't currently in the ethereum core implementation doesn't prevent such a scheme from being implemented as an add-on...)

Yes, my prediction is that the status quo will continue until Germany has a recession: At that point, two things might happen, separately or together:
1. Capitol controls are put in place in Greece, so that a euro can become "trapped" in Greece. In essence Greece now has its own "Gox Bux" which look like euros but are really controlled by the Greek government, and in essence Greece has its own defacto currency again. If this happens, Bitcoins will come into play like never before.
2. A deal will be forged where the PIIGS ( will give up significant fiscal autonomy in exchange for an additional bailout- This deal can't just include Greece, since Greece is really just a "sideshow". At this point, those countries would become "wards of the state" of the European Union (And would function similar to how states function in the USA) This second scenario would have little or no impact on Bitcoin.
One or both of these will have to happen at some point, but not in the next couple of years.

Spain and Portugal, if they put in place capital controls and start their own currencies, would immediately make euro transactions illegal... They would announce "pesos are the only legal tender" At that point, the only thing the government would want you to do is dutifully deposit them into your bank, to be put into a peso-denominated account, of course. 
At that point, you'd either have to spend your euros on the black market, where they may be confiscated. Or, you could purchase items abroad with them by smuggling euros across the border, where they may also be confiscated.
In both of those situations it would be preferable to use Bitcoin to euros. (That said, I agree completely that 99% of the population would use euros instead of Bitcoin, regardless)

Just to clear up three of the main inaccuracies about ethereum in this article:
1. Ethereum does not contain any features for "decentralized file storage, identity and reputation management"... all it has is an improved scripting language for its blockchain, users of ethereum are certainly able to implement these things if they wish. (Unless the article considers Bitcoin addresses to be "identity management", 'cause we have addresses in ethereum, too.) 
2. Ethereum is 3 months behind schedule, but I haven't heard of anyone on the ethereum dev team "scaling back their ambitions"- It always was and continues to be an ambitious project.
3. AFAIK, the ethereum smart contract system has not been ported over to Bitcoin- The port referred to only works on the testnet and even then it cannot use Bitcoin alone to execute contracts (it requires the counterparty currency to run contracts.)

1. You would use a wallet that says "supports lightning network"
2. When you start your wallet the first time it might ask a questions "Which lightning network tracker do your wish to use?" and give you a list to pick from.
3. You initiate a payment from your wallet.
4. Your wallet will try to find a lightning network link between you and the other party, using the tracker.
5. If it can't find one, it will ask "Do you wish to initiate a channel with provider X to permit an LN transaction?" if you say "no", it will then send a traditional Bitcoin transaction.

Fair point... What this boils down to is that cryptocurrency is in this unique situation where it (theoretically at least) has it's own superior solutions to problems such as fraud and the other problems this regulation is set to address, but these solutions are nowhere near mature enough yet to work adequately.
Combined with the fact that new regulatory rules are almost always vague in the sorts of ways described by OP (because no concrete case law has been established yet to give guidance) it means we're in this bizarre race right now to see if the regulation can get better faster than it can be obsoleted by crypto-based solutions.

What you're describing is called "weak subjectivity" and is currently all the rage in "proof of stake" altcoin circles.

The OP article is really pretty shoddy: If you look at the table, the data actually shows that withdrawals are down in the past week. Also, at no time does the article present data as to what typical outflows in Greece look like, as a comparison.
Additionally: Greece has had negative exports for ages, what we see in that graph is EXACTLY what I'd expect to see, at least in the direction of cash flow... having a negative cashflow has been "business as usual" for Greece for a long, long time- If the article was trying to present evidence of a "crisis" it did a poor job.

Overall, this suggests to me that Bitcoin will continue to march towards becoming a "store of value" more so than a "medium of exchange". (The fact is, the tps figure Gavin is throwing out don't make much sense in a world of bots, as alsomahler correctly pointed out.)
However, I actually think this is a GOOD thing. IMHO it may be inevitable that the world of cryptocurrencies is going to split into two major currencies sometime soon, with Bitcoin filling the "store of value" role, at a higher transaction fee, and another currency (yet to be decided) filling the "medium of exchange" role, and being used for lower-cost transactions.
(Though I'm sure this will be a controversial opinion on r/bitcoin)
@_date: 2014-06-09 20:50:20
I don't quite follow: Bitcoin miners also verify transactions, yet the process of verifying regular old bitcoin transactions has nothing intrinsically to do with sha256.
Sure, if you could create some kind of "contract execution proof of work", like is being discussed by the ethereum guys, there might be some efficiency improvements in the long run. However, it seems like in the near future the limiting factor on ethereum will be blockchain bandwidth, not CPU cycles, so I don't see what the payoff is for this, besides the more general argument of "Anyone creating an altcoin should try to be ASIC resistant at the outset to avoid an immediate forking"
(I'm not saying there isn't some payoff, I'm just saying that if there is, I'm not smart enough to see where it is :-)

Bitcoin is not appropriate for "the poor". The future of bitcoin is as an asset ledger for the rich, everyone should just come to terms with this an move on.
Instead of worrying about the fees for bitcoin transactions, we need to develop a robust mechanism for pegging microtransaction-friendly cryptocurrencies to bitcoin- I don't care whether it's called "sidechains" or "treechains" or something else. (I consider a microtransaction-friendly currency to be one that has a terabyte-sized blockchain, or that uses some less-proven technology to implement the equivalent of a terabyte-sized blockchain.)
These alternate, pegged, currencies would offer lower security guarantees in exchange for miniscule transaction costs.
If we don't figure out a way to do this "two way pegging" in the next couple of years, bitcoin will remain a small time currency. If we instead solve this problem, it might become the world's primary currency in a decade.

I see a paradox here in that Gavin criticizes the complexity of ethereum but then suggests an alternative that sounds even more complicated. 
This seems to be a theme whenever a new altcoin innovation comes out... some person says "This would be a lot simpler if we just ducttape it on top of bitcoin" even though that leads to the most complex final product imaginable.
I agree with him however that ethereum would probably be better off if it just used a standard sha256/scrypt-style proof of work, since changing the proof of work seems orthogonal to the other problems ethereum is trying to solve.

One thing missed in the sidechain discussion is that sidechains can also be leveraged for easier currency conversions. Contrary to prevailing wisdom, I think sidechains could lead to MORE currencies, not less. I think lots of altcoins will be dual-currency, using BTC for store of value, and a custom currency for other operations, and a floating exhange rate to make the economics work out. (though of course it's too early to tell right now how things play out.)
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:47:28
You seem to frequent bitcoin forums based on your history, so it seems like you'd know enough not to make this argument (but maybe I misunderstand your argument)
Yes, of course it's possible to track coins between multiple wallets owned by the same person. That's exactly why a knowledgeable person who owns such coins would use a mixer (or multiple mixers.) Certainly, someone who owns a large stash of coins might mix them slowly over time, so maybe that's part of the argument you're making. Or, they will mix them at a future date when they want to use the coins to buy their dream house.


That's an unsubstantiated assignation of motives. Maybe the person just likes the convenience of bitcoin storage and/or doesn't want to deal with the hassles of explaining large amounts of USD to authorities, even if they can cash them out in a way that can't be traced to a theft.
Certainly, if Rogoff's plans to argue that mixers should be made illegal, then this story gets more complicated. If this is his argument, then he is basically arguing that bitcoin should be made illegal altogether, since mixing and non-mixing operations are indistinguishable in the general case (which again would indicate his ignorance, since he is trying to argue a pro-bitcoin position, apparently.)

I'm guessing there's a whale who has been trying to convert large amounts of BTC in dollars in the last few weeks and who has placed shrouded limit orders that prevents the price from reacting to positive news.
This makes me suggest there really might have been a fairly recent MtGox theft by a single individual, since this would be the logical place to look for such a large trove of bitcoins- The actions of this person are preventing a typical "random walk" from occurring, because their large influence is preventing typical market behaviors.
It's impossible to know when this person is fully cashed out, but whenever this happens (days? years?) I suspect the market will respond positively to positive news reports again and may start climbing again.

When I look at the economic theory it boils down to the fact that moving from a more "inflationary" to a "deflationary" environment will almost certainly cause a temporary economic shock. This shock would almost certainly happen and could be severe.
Once the economy has adjusted to a deflationary system, every evidence I've seen suggest it'll run just fine (perhaps even better than an inflationary system) Of course we can't know for sure, since the only time such an environment has existed in the past is under involuntary circumstances that muddy the water significantly.

I would vote for Tim Hartford in "The Undercover Economist Strikes Back". That book is an excellent read, currently also available on Audible.com.
That brand new book is essentially the best explanation on Keynsianism for the lay person currently available. Like most good bitcoiners, I completely disagree with the book, but the fact that I recommend it anyway should tell you something about its quality.
He explicitly mentions bitcoin in the book (essentially just to argue it's a poor currency because of volatility) but indirectly addresses bitcoin by his many arguments regarding the dangers of deflation.
I highly recommend that book to anyone in this forum- You need to understand the inflationist argument if you want to be well-informed on the economics of bitcoin.

I think it goes something like this:
"There's a reason there's computer geeks in the world and there's finance people in the world and why finance people make WAY WAY more money than geeks. With bitcoins, geeks are dreaming that they can control the money and hence make the big bucks, but what we're seeing now is there's a reason why finance people are well paid, it's because finance is hard and computer programming is easy. Look at all the bitcoin geeks falling flat on their face, thinking they can have their own currency and that they can handle finance."

Everyone wondering why PayPal/Amazon/WesternUnion like praising bitcoin but refuse to commit any resources to it...
...it's very simple: These companies all invested enormous capital building a legal framework that allowed them to establish their payment systems back in the 80s/90s. Paypal, for all intents and purposes is now considered 100% "legit", and the lobbying and legal fees that were spent to get to that point were extensive. They probably totally realize how innovative bitcoin is and would _love_ to capture the bitcoin market, but...
...why should they risk mixing their existing business systems that smell like roses (due to all the $$$ they spent and spend) with a system like bitcoin that is still unproven and has an uncertain reputation? If Paypal/Amazon/WU added serious bitcoin support into their systems, they'd risk "poisoning" their existing payment infrastructure with something that might get negative attention from regulators.
They are going to be extremely careful before they get on board, that's just the way it is.

If you haven't heard, Piketty is a French economics wunderkind who currently has a worldwide bestselling book called "Capital in the Twenty-first Century".
Bitcoiners should be aware of this book because it recommends a "wealth tax" that taxes ALL wealth of rich people on a regular basis, not just yearly income.
As we saw in Cyprus, policies that ask people to take a "haircut" on their wealth tends to increase interest in bitcoin, so I'm surprised I haven't seen any mention yet of this book on Everyone here should know about this book and the attention it is currently receiving.

Fun fact: In WW2 they would crack OTP reuse via mechanical XORing. How do you XOR mechanically? You put the two cyphertexts on film reals as black &amp; white binary dots, then spin them in opposite directions at high speeds on top of each other, and shine a light through the reels to find a spot that comes up as extra bright using a light sensor... That spot represents the same word being reused at the same spot of a reused OTP. Once such a spot is found, decoding the messages becomes possible.

Is your theory of money falsifiable?
If bitcoin reaches $10,000 a coin and stays that high for twenty years, would you then say "I was wrong" or would you just come back here and say "This is just more evidence that bitcoins aren't money and are a scam, just like I predicted." 
What are some precise milestones that bitcoin could reach where you'd have to agree a bitcoins long-term value is greater than zero?
A theory that isn't falsifiable is not useful (though I still commend you for going out on a limb in 2011 and expressing an opinion... but it needs to be a falsifiable opinion, or you have no credibility.)

Agreed, but a layperson still needs to trust that they don't have compromised wallet software, even with POW. If a government censor forces wallet vendors to hide any transactions to the user's wallet that they want to prohibit, isn't that an analogous problem to the ones you're pointing out for checkpointing with POS?

I think high volatility in an ETF is dangerous because an ETF is not a true market.

Keep in mind, the purpose of checkpointing in more recent POS designs is to answer an objective question, which is "had my node been running the entire time on the network, what blocks would it consider valid?"
Because there is an objective truth at the heart of checkpointing, it means the checkpoint can't just be replaced willy-nilly by a regulator: Anything other than the objectively true block would clearly be rejected by the community- It's not like community A would prefer the regulator's block and community B another block... Anyone who had run a node continuously in the past would be 100% sure which block is the correct one- There is an objective measure for correctness of a checkpoint.

The same argument applies to bitcoin. People say "How can bitcoin make remittances easier than just using the thousands of Western Union stores conveniently peppered across the globe?" The answer is that bitcoin decouples the process of acquiring/transmitting/selling an asset so that a single party like WU doesn't need to handle every piece simultaneously. In time, this will obsolete the infrastructure WU has established (at least that's what most bitcoiners are predicting...)
In the same way, ethereum is all about decoupling accounts, contracts &amp; feeds. Yes, you can argue "but isn't just the same as having a single party handling all these parts simultaneously?" and you'd be right, but by decoupling them and allowing different parties/technologies handle each part you obviate a lot of infrastructure and gain flexibility/efficiency, in the same way that bitcoin is chipping away at WU.

I would think any truly successful future bitcoin-inspired projects will REMOVE as much from bitcoin as they ADD to it.
People have a hard enough time understanding bitcoin already, and it is arguably a very simple system... in the end, there will never be more than 100 people on the entire planet who can truly understand ethereum/namecoin/ripple/etc fully. How can systems like that ever be successful?

p2p file sharing without a monetary incentive mechanism is inherently limited in its potential.

You make a fair point, if you view Moore's law simply as a guarantee of exponentially improving performance you are correct. 
However, I think that's an oversimplification of what Moore's law (and similar rules regarding improving network speed and disk performance) give you, when it comes to real performance.
I terms of real-world performance I'd guess we're seeing 10-20% improvement in vague "general computing capacity" every year, which is just able to keep pace with the 20%+ yearly increase in blockchain size we're seeing right now (blockchain pruning and such certainly help things keep pace.)
Yes, a few years in the future the exponential aspects of the technology ramp will certainly dominate over the linear aspects when it comes to bitcoin. That said, my personal view is that a 20MB block size is reasonable even today, but we're certainly getting close to a danger point where we'll be less enticing to new adopters who download the stock client and might find they need to wait 2-3 days (or whatever the repercussions of the change will be) before they can start using a bitcoin wallet- Moore's law may be exponential, but so possibly is the number of people you will lose as customers in every additional hour they need to wait to get the blockchain downloaded to their computer.

In terms of supply and demand, Karpeles' formula just sets the "supply" to "infinite", except with a time delay.

What if I want full uptime during network partitioning, as well?
What if I want the low latency that comes with having the full database stored on the local device?
What if I have 10 or 20 "databases", and I don't want to trust a single server with access to all of them, and instead want a user to be able to provide decryption keys on the client side that allows them to operate on them?
What if data collected on the local device needs to be integrated with the full database in less time than a server round trip would permit?

If everyone is trusted, you don't need incentives or a third party... every node just "does its job" which is to send out a mining "heartbeat" without any POW needed.

So, if you build a site like this the first question is "where does the bitcoin come from?"
If the answer to this question is "just a random reader of the site" then you're basically suggesting an alternative to tipping, which isn't enough of an improvement over the existing reddit tipping system to justify a new site.
If the answer to this question is "The subreddit maintains a bounty ahead of time that is supplied by people who want to entice high quality content providers" then the answer is that it's too easy for the bounty providers to cheat in this system by just logging in under a separate anonymous account and upvoting the bounty to their own anonymous accounts.
I'm trying to solve this problem with "Project Groundhog" described here: 
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:24:45
Just like eris technologies: For mining, you just use a heartbeat (since everyone is trusted this is fine) then you have the "business rules" usually maintained by a server stored as smart contracts, on the blockchain.
It's like every client maintains its own copy of the app server, and the blockchain mechanism ensures the "servers" all stay identical over time.

Not at all- The data is encrypted, and each user who is allowed access to the system is given decryption keys, and a hash for the genesis block is agreed upon, a single time... this can be done completely off-line- I could use your argument to say "Bitcoin is centralized because all clients agree to a centrally-decided genesis block"


That's not what I'm proposing. I'm saying every node is completely independent and simply proposes new blocks with its peers, like with bitcoin, but without POW.


So I agree the most knowledgeable bitcoin devs have been mum on this, which gives your position weight. Plus, I agree completely that my approach may be wrong headed, for reasons I haven't realized yet.
However, the only two cryptocurrency experts that I've heard talk about this particular approach are Vitalk and Peter Todd, and they have made positive statements regarding this approach- I agree though those two are too controversial to be considered "A list" cryptocurrency developers... Have you heard Gavin or Garzik et al say that such a system is unworkable? I'd love to hear their positions on this.

What MOST people care about is whether something is a good and useful idea, whether you call it a "blockchain" or a "cheese noodle" doesn't matter.
The fact is (and I know most people on r/bitcoin hate to hear this, for reasons that are strangely irrational, given the general rationalist nature of the Bitcoin community) that "cheese noodles" are actually a pretty awesome idea (i.e. a blockchain-like thing that runs on a network with trusted peers and without a token.) I hope to build some software systems with them in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:38:56
Right, so the idea I'm proposing doesn't have the same benefits as Bitcoin. It lacks some benefits of Bitcoin, but has other benefits that Bitcoin doesn't have. I already agree 100% with you that Bitcoin is awesome and that you lose some (but not all) of the awesomeness with the approach I'm describing.
All I'm saying is, this may be another good idea, which has a data structure that is very similar to Bitcoin (whether you want to call this data structure a "blockchain" or something else is besides the point)
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:35:54
Right, so you're envisioning a more sophisticated version of the current bitcoin tipping system. It could work, but it will still be bound by people tipping/upvoting stories "out of the goodness of their hearts."
I think the game theory gets more interesting if you have a bounty system where people say a-priory "I want stories about such-and-such and am going to put up some serious money to get these stories". Then it isn't just a "goodness of their hearts" thing but a "I will pay you real money" thing but the ways to cheat the system become more of an issue and a workable design is going to start looking very different from vanilla reddit, at least from what I can tell, thinking about the problem.

Even if all the nodes are trusted, it is still valuable to have a consensus mechanism. Are there other consensus mechanisms that could work in a trusted environment besides blockchains?

@_date: 2015-03-23 15:39:39
(I feel weird being put into a position defending eris, as I too have reservations BTW)


Mining and POW are not the same thing... in the type of system Eris proposes, I think the mining could simply be done on a timer (or with a very small amount of POW) as all nodes are trusted 100% on the local net.
The goal here is to make sure the number of proposed new blocks by the miners on the network is managable in number, so you don't want 1000000 blocks every second or one block every 1000000 years. As long as there is a mechanism whereby the mining happens within a reasonable timeframe, you can get the advantages of a blockchain over a central database (admittedly, not that many) at a negligible cost in mining overhead.

As a developer for a large medical company: By far, the  problem in hospital IT and big data medical research is incompatibility between different software systems- If you could fix that seemingly mundane problem, medical research would become orders of magnitude more efficient. As a cryptocurrency geek, the only solution I see to this obstacle is to have medical software vendors use a variety of private and public blockchains linked with smart contracts... Oh, and if you're sick, maybe you'd want your hospital to have software with 100% uptime, ddos resistance, easy installs, and partition tolerance, too.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:59:46
To be fair, you could build a very nice system that uses blockchain technology but doesn't have a currency- If you do that, you'll end up with something similar to how "git" works, but with better consensus handling. However, you'd have to trust all the participating nodes to do POW without a reward, which is only possible if you work with people you know in the real world. (in the same way you need some trust when using git version control that people are maintaining a local repo to get redundancies guarantees in git)
However, this has really different use cases than a cryptocurrency blockchain. If you look at what eris is doing ( they are essentially taking that approach.
In short "using a blockchain without bitcoin means something very different than what you think it means"

I think there's plenty of room to criticize the new phased release plan, but a major delay of the genesis block probably won't happen... At the very beginning of the first phase you'll be able to mine ether on top of a genesis block. A more valid criticism would be to say that ethereum won't be a "real" cryptocurrency from the start, since the ethereum team plans to have some centralized safeguards in place early on.

If you use Riak, there is no "server side python" that is atomic AFAIK because there is no centralized server (I am not a Riak expert though... If you say "I'm a riak expert" and this can be done in some esoteric way, I don't have the time right now to research the nuances of this compared to a blockchain- My goal here is just to explain what eris is trying to do, not prove beyond a reasonable doubt to some random dude on the internet that it's the best solution for all things in the universe.)

I don't want to get into a "but git isn't a database" argument, but the idea is to use blockchains like developers use "git": You don't need to set up/maintain a server, and any client logging into the system shares in providing redundancy, as blockchains allows you to do.

IMHO, the two main benefits of blockchains over traditional distributed databases are (1) they are far more resistant to denial of service attacks and (2) they can be used to build a smart contract system, which is hard when dealing with something like paxos.
The reason people hate private blockchains is because those people RIGHTLY understand that private blockchain offer no protection from attacks beyond a traditional DB but the WRONGLY overlook that the smart contract benefits of blockchains remain useful even in a private blockchain architecture (because most bitcoiners haven't delved into smart contracts yet)

They are secured by mining, just not with a currency, AFAIK.
You should read Satoshi's description of the byzantine general's problem: 
Notice how the word "currency" never appears, and how this is essentially a "local net" that does not need to be worldwide to work.
(That said, there are problems with blockchains that lack currencies in that they cause poor economic incentives... the approach that satoshi describes here, and that Eris is suggesting, therefore has only limited applicability in particular controlled environments.)

Oh, there's no shortage of standards, and standards to standardize the other standards... the problem is that all the standards take literally decades to develop, and deviate from actual implementations by individual vendors, and vendors can't cross check other people's implementations because all the software is hidden in black boxes- What's needed is for all the interface code from the different systems to run on a shared, inspectable, auditable, layer, allowing for faster turn-around... a system that is "open" not only in the sense of "open source" at a development level, but fully open at run time, as well. (Also, it's odd to hear someone on r/bitcoin advocate for "standards" since bitcoin doesn't have one and relies entirely on a highly open and inspectable reference implementation)

The fact is that every little bit of growth the BTC community sees will likely be slow and excruciating and failure-prone.

I really am bothered when people think this way about money... Money is fungible, it doesn't "care" where it came from.
It may or may not be a good idea for OP to borrow against his 401K.
He may or may not be in a financial situation to take on more investment risk.
Bitcoin may or may not be a good investment.
He may or may not have other sources of investment capital.
All the above statements are 100% independent issues and need to be assessed separately as to whether they hold. It doesn't matter where the money "came from."
(Sorry, I know this is somewhat pedantic and you may just have been using this as shorthand for saying "If you're the kind of person who has to borrow against their 401K to buy BTC you might not have good financial circumstances for taking on significant BTC investment." which I think is a better way to make your point.)

Personally, I'm not a fan of people who are security zealots and insist every site needs to have extreme levels of security. I think if a site that is used for trivial things has a weak security system it isn't the end of the world (not sure if P2PBitExchange falls in that category.)
Even Hacker News, for instance, completely ignores typical security rules for their site (their login site is prone to man-in-the-middle  but is still a perfectly fine service.
I think in fact that people who insist that every site have the latest state of the art encryption system for passwords are the same people who stamp 80% of government documents as "classified". We're trying to lower the barrier to entry with Bitcoin, not raise it.
(That said, if you're handling wallets with your website you better read up on the latest info on security and make sure you know what you're doing, that's just common sense...)

Not that I know the business, but usually the reason is as follows:

2. If I rent out rigs, there's a 30% chance the renters are deadbeats and don't pay their rent and I lose my investment.
However,  and  are (largely) independent risks. Hence, I will put 100K into my own mining shop, and 100K into a rental business. Diversified in this way, my chance for a total loss of my investment is only 0.3*0.3 which is roughly 10%.

Any article that talks about Cyprus and does not contain the phrase "depositor's insurance" is almost certainly not worth reading.
People seem to, in general, have a wrong understanding of the Cyprus situation: The thing that made it horrific is that the Cypriot government had depositor's insurance for deposits under 100K and decided to renege on that promise. This was a legitimate reason to freak out and was essentially theft. Luckily, the Cypriot government came to their senses and decided not to enact this change in policy.
The fact that people who had MORE than 100K in the banks lost money is GOOD for capitalism and the health of the banking system (though of course not good for the depositors who put too much trust in untrustworthy banks.) Also, this is far preferable to the "too big to fail" banking system we have in the US.
We WANT banks to fail and destroy depositor's wealth when they screw up, because otherwise we have to pay for their mistakes with our tax money and we create a moral hazard. Also, if banks carry a risk for depositors that will properly align the incentives for those depositors. One incentive they would have is to move to BTCs.
In the US our over-regulated banking system means that BTCs are less of an alternative to traditional banking (because the US government essentially subsidizes the banking system.)

... more branches of software:
Yes, this problem happened because the 0.7 and 0.8 versions own significant shares of the mining software. If more unique implementations of the mining software existed and there was more diversity this problem couldn't happen (the failing software would just be shut out until it's fixed.)
... power of the devs:
Keep in mind the power of the software devs was very limited here: They just got to decide which branch (0.7 or 0.8) should be favored. It's similar to a country that develops more roads and the government has to decide whether everyone should drive on the left or right side of the road- That's a pretty limited type of power.
...protocol fully tested &amp; documented:
I think this episode shows that the protocol ISN'T fully documented and tested. This is the key thing that will hopefully be improved after this incident.
...government placing vulnerabilities in the code:
This is pretty much impossible. The code is open source and there'd be no room for a vulnerability to hide for long. If the devs force one into the main code base everyone would jump to another fork of the code not controlled by the tainted devs.
...are bitcoin users unaware of the problems:
I think there's many potential problems that bitcoins could run into, despite their promise, and that's why investing in bitcoins is so profitable: Large risk --&gt; Large profit.
...does this episode damage bitcoin's reputation?

There are two waves of fallout that can come from SR, we've only weathered the first so far.
The first wave was due to speculators, who are trained for quick portfolio adjustments, liquidating their btc positions.
The second wave will come from all the SR buyer/sellers that got scared by the SR bust. Since these folks will probably prefer to lay low for a while to avoid attention, they're going to liquidate their holdings more slowly, over weeks and months.
The second wave worries me more, because this population probably holds a significant % of outstanding coins, giving them significant ability to affect the money supply, and probably only a small fraction of the speculators in the first wave reacted to the SR news with a short position.

I think you're right in that bitcoin is in a precarious spot right now, where many people geeky enough to read up on bitcoin have done so already, and the remaining people don't have the time or patience to get over the learning hump. Telling people "OMG buy bitcoins and you'll get rich!" isn't the solution to wider adoption right now.
The solution, I think is to start presenting bitcoin more as an "easy payment system" instead of an "investment opportunity". I think even many folks that have briefly explored bitcoin are completely unaware how easy it is to perform bitcoin transactions. This, I think, is the main weak point in how bitcoin is currently presented to newbies.

One thing that's so great about the internet is that it made information "programmable"- Sites like Google, Craigslist, Reddit, etc are basically algorithms that sit on top of data to make it more useful. What's even more important is that the internet makes the "programming of information" cheap and easy, allowing lots of small developers to experiment with new ways to convey information.
Currently, the same abilities do not exist when dealing with money: If you want to create an "algorithm on top of money" with traditional techniques there's many reasons this is extremely difficult:
   1. You have to have your site authorized by Paypal, etc as a vendor
   2. You have to interact with horrifically complicated interfaces these payment providers offer you (so complicated because Paypal, etc want 100% control over how your site uses money)
   3. If your site offers a service that falls into a legal "grey area" Paypal, etc will refuse to let you use their API.
   4. You have to pay outrageous fees to Paypal, etc.
   5. You may not be able to accommodate international customers.
   6. You cannot be assured that a sale is final- Paypal et al can decide arbitrarily to block your access to your funds or to return them to the customer, even after the sale has been finalized.
Bitcoin solves all of these problems. Bitcoin makes money "programmable". Bitcoin will lead to a boon of technical innovation involving money.

I agree there may be an argument to be made there.
To go off on a tangent though:
I don't understand the argument people keep making that it is not "smart" to use a system simply because it has hypothetical NSA backdoors- It doesn't seem rational to argue this, since a smart person may still put a very low probability to ever experiencing harm from this back door.
To me it seems sort of like arguing a person should never drive in a car, simply because car accidents can happen: If the net benefit of the activity is high enough, a low risk of negative repercussions is acceptable, from a rational standpoint.
Sure, a person might (hypothetically speaking) risk a lifetime of torture in Gitmo because they continue to use a google docs account, and the NSA misinterprets something they write in a document there, but that isn't really a meaningful factor that should drive the decisions they make.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:29:34
To play devils advocate, here's the best case that I think can be made for bitcoin derivatives regulation:
Usually futures and derivatives are used by businesses to hedge risks. Usually, such a risk is an unusual and catastrophic increase of decrease in the price of bitcoins. In order for a counterparty to be able to bear the risk, they will need to have large bitcoin or dollar assets available.
Usually, in an open economy like the bitcoin economy we ensure the credibility of this counterparty by tracking reputation. However, when it comes to hedging against unusual situations (which as we said is a large part of the derivatives business) it is impossible to establish a reputation, since these events are uncommon.
Hence, the only way to establish the legitimacy of a derivatives provider in these cases is to have an independent party study the balance sheet of the provider to determine if they are maintaining the necessary assets so that they can legitimately bear this burden.
(This is exactly what wasn't done properly with AIG, the derivatives insurance provider that collapsed in 2008)
*Just to be clear, I don't agree with this position. Instead, I think someone should establish a "consumer reports" (or several) for bitcoin derivatives providers that is given privileged access to balance sheets but is non governmental and voluntary.*

"How popular can a currency become when the price is wildly volatile and liquidity is not guaranteed"

The video makes some good points, but it is not an objective assessment of the situation. You need to bring your own critical analysis to the table. Realize that economies are dynamic entities and things in it constantly change, so it's always easy to create scary graphs by cherry picking (and I agree _some_ things about the current situation are genuinely scary.)

No: Chinese people are selling yuan to non-Chinese bitcoiners who are speculating. However, they're saturating the non-Chinese people, who now have more yuan than they can handle.
The same thing happened in Brazil and this is why Brazilian BTCs have been carrying a premium.
Over time, the prices will normalize back to match non-Chinese prices, as more people who are capable of converting yuan to USD in large quantities see a profit opportunity and enter the market and perform the appropriate arbitrage.
Another way to look at this is that Chinese people are using bitcoins to buy USD using Yuan, while avoiding currency export restrictions.

Well, the only way they could start off "taking advantage" with their $$ is to buy BTCs from somewhere. If they did this, the price of bitcoins would go gang busters, and all current BTC owners would benefit.
As far as "financial skills", I think you're overestimating how much those "skills" are worth: If you were, right now, to throw darts at a list of wall street stocks to make investments, you'd end up with a rate of return on your investment, on average, very similar compared to, say, a mutual fund created by Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, etc.
The reason these companies are so wealthy is NOT because they have a better understanding of how markets behave, but because they understand how US and international laws connect with investments and can influence the government to legalize any new investment vehicle they create. This gives them a monopoly on certain types of investments and allows them to live the high life.
However, since bitcoins are currently still only weakly controlled by the legal system, this advantage doesn't help them to take over the BTC market. (Though once the US government starts clamping down on BTC, I suppose the scenario you outline might then be possible)

My understanding is that he means phenomena not prone to bubbles. I think in his book he applies this term more to organizations and not to investment vehicles. When he uses the term to refer to organizations, he means a company is unlikely to fail when unusual things happen (i.e. "black swans"). Nassim likes to invent new words for his ideas that is kind of annoying and unnecessary. Despite this, he makes _some_ good points in his books.
Bitcoins are a speculated security and hence prone to bubbles, like any other security. However, if you wanted to create an investment portfolio that was "antifragile" (to use his silly term) you would be wise to put a fraction of the portfolio into bitcoins (and gold, and antiques, and foreign stocks, etc etc) in order to minimize fragility.

It's an agent-based model that simulates markets, with a floating currency. I'd like to say more, but it needs more work before it's ready for a larger audience.
What they show is that (as I think an Austrian would expect) the "hoarded" part of the currency is irrelevant to the quantity of money being exchanged, because the real purchasing power of a unit of currency will increase to keep the quantity of money in active circulation constant, all other things being equal. All that deflation/inflation change is _who_ is circulating the money, either the top earners, or the people in control of the money presses.

I hate to sound so negative, but after thinking about it, I think a video is really a piss-poor way of promoting bitcoins. The fact is that video ads are all about personality and emotion, but unfortunately bitcoin requires you to convey *information* to people, which is very hard to do in a video in a way that is effective (BTW I created a successful niche video ad a couple years ago at landoflisp.com.)
You could still make a helpful video, but in order for it to work it would have to have a VERY simple message. I would make the message "Bitcoins are like paypal but not owned by a big nasty corporation." To maximize the emotional value, I'd make it with live actors. I'd show three vignettes that show real people with emotionally-charged problems that can't be helped by current solutions:
   1. A young Kenyan man wants to send money to his grandma in Kenya via paypal, but after hours on the phone with paypal customer support they say this isn't something he can do. (or pick some other country that is best at showing international limitations of paypal.)
   2. A lady who knits sweaters and sells them on ebay is told the buyer reversed the paypal charges so she lost her money and sweater.
   3. A programmer for a charity explains how she tried to get verified as a merchant by paypal so the charity could accept donations online, but she is unable to get the proper developer keys because of paypal red tape.
I think that's the best you can do- Otherwise, you'll just end up with another snooze-fest, like the current weusecoins video. (That isn't to say there shouldn't be improved informational materials for bitcoin, I just don't think they should be in video form.)

An irrational part of me dislikes Trace for giving off this "Golf-playing frat boy" vibe. But that makes him PERFECT for these business channel TV appearances.
And the way he answered the "why don't I just use my credit card?" question was serious ju-jitsu: You could just see the interviewer struggling at that point because she was forced to skip her next few questions (which would have been along the lines of "won't hackers just steal people's bitcoins?")

Here is an easy and immediately useful thing I would use:
If someone is building a bitcoin tutorial there is currently no easy tool to complement the bitcoin faucet: Something that lets you easily spend a few satoshies, in exchange for some product, for testing purposes. I would use it for the tutorial I'm working on right now, if you built it.
What would work best, I think, is a "Bitcoin fortune cookie" site: If someone spends a satoshi or more, give them a fortune in exchange (the obvious place to get these are from the unix fortune database.)
This would be easy and immediately useful- You might even be able to make revenue from ads.
Note: If someone knows of a site that is good for spending satoshies, and doesn't involve gambling, let me know. I don't know of any (and I don't want people to be able to say "look, even the tutorials for bitcoin immediately start with gambling.")

You scramble together all the data from the last block into a single number, but also add an extra random number called a "nonce".
This "scrambling" is done in a special way so that even if the tiniest change is made to the initial data (or the nonce) the resulting number is totally different.
Then, you say that the resulting number (which is binary) has to start with ten zeroes. The miners then try random nonce values until the resulting number has the desired number of starting zeroes. There is no "shortcut" the miners can take: The only way they can find a good nonce is to try the scrambling operation over and over and over again with different nonces.
If it turns out to be too easy, the network then switches from ten to eleven zeroes, which is much harder.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:11:42
There's a second layer to this as well: Paypal is now in the same position Sony Music was in when Napster was released. If Sony had released a meaningful Napster competitor in response they would have still lost a lot of money, but they would have lost LESS money than with their actual strategy, which was to simply wait and hope digital music was a fad, and people would start buying CDs again.
In the same way, if PayPal goes all in with bitcoin they probably will lose money in the short run compared to just enjoying their current position as king of the hill. But in the long run they will regret it if they wait on the sidelines.
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:12:14
Yes, of course you're right. But at least with bitcoins, if you ask me "will a bitcoin be worth less five years from now" I think even skeptics would say "Hard to tell."
With dollars, there is virtually 100% certainty that a dollar bill will be worth less 5 years from now.

Some people are skilled at getting USD out of China (these are Chinese bitcoiners, who are using bitcoins to get capital out of China)
Some people are skilled at getting USD into China (not bitcoiners, but they will step up to the plate after a delay, given the arbitrage opportunity that has now appeared. These will probably be Chinese expats in the US who want to send Yuan to their family in China and now have a HUGE incentive to learn about bitcoins)

I think you need to filter your thoughts down to something more specific before asking for feedback. For the most part, I don't see why you think it's such a problem that a currency increases in value by 4% every year (such as a hypothetical "mature" bitcoin economy) instead of decreasing 4% every year (current dollar economy). Is it really the end of the world if people charge 8% interest or something on loans to cover the deflation?
Also, the loan "trust" issue you mention is a non-issue: Clearly, both parties would just work with a trusted intermediary (i.e. a bank that helps with bitcoin loans)

You didn't read to the end of the article... If you have to pay property taxes you don't fully "own" your house, even without a loan.
I know about this first hand: My grandfather died at an early age and my grandmother (with her four children) owned a house with fifty acres, WITHOUT a mortgage, near Minneapolis.
Well, one day in the 60s the county decided to build a road close to her property and her "appraised value" immediately increased tenfold, which my grandmother couldn't afford to pay taxes on. But being such nice guys, the county officials then said "Just hand over 49.5 acres to us immediately and we'll let you keep your house!"

The wealth never existed in the first place.
Noone knows how much wealth there is to begin with: Obviously, if everyone sold all their BTCs tomorrow the value would quickly head to zero, so even though we have a $1bn market cap, that isn't the "actual value" since we can't all get that amount tomorrow.
There is, however, an easy way to know what something is worth in retrospect: Look at what people are willing to pay for it at some future date.
Conclusion: We don't know how much BTC wealth the is right now. But in the future we WILL have some idea of how much wealth there WAS. If the wealth ends up being smaller than expected, it does not mean any wealth was "lost", it just means our initial wealth estimates were wrong.

The problem is not that economists don't like bitcoin, it's that many seem to dislike it for reasons that don't make a lot of sense.
There are lots of well reasoned criticisms to be made against bitcoin, but I have yet to hear an economist make them.
For one thing, economists seem to be obsessed with whether bitcoin is a "bubble", but those are the same people who have been shouting "economics can't be used to predict bubbles" after the 2008 crisis.
I had a lot more respect for economics as a profession before they gave their poorly formed opinions on bitcoins.

In all seriousness, this is how I see the next five years playing out (warning: total speculation)
1. The CFTC or some other government agency decides it needs to impose some rules on the bitcoin system. Since they don't understand btcs it will include some ridiculous provisions like "all bitcoin addresses need to be labeled with a verified user and mailing address."
2. Reality sinks in with the agency, and they realize none of this can be enforced like they originally envisioned it. But now they've already spent so much money writing reports and paying consultants that they have do something to justify the expense.
3. They file some weird, watered down claim in federal court against coinbase or mtgox. The suit will make some strange arguments about money laundering, but it will be a mess because their claims are really against the bitcoin protocol itself, not some money exchange service.
4. The case against the exchange(s) gets dragged out forever since the regulator can't remember any more what the point of the whole thing was in the first place, and the law suit becomes a political liability because of all the money that went into it.
5. The case gets quietly withdrawn after 5 years.

With bitcoin, this problem is completely eliminated. The weekly "stolen credit cards" stories (Adobe, Barnes and Noble, etc) are laughable to a bitcoiner.

This is like saying "What if Sony had released a Napster competitor when Napster came out?"
The answer to the question is that Sony would still have lost a lot of money, but LESS than they did by not having a Napster alternative. Because of bureaucracy, something like that would never happen, even though it's a rational strategy.

Well, I agree you're right that there are bad people in the government. I think the most common retort to your argument would be something along the lines of "Well why don't you go live in Somalia then if you think you'd be better off with no taxes and 0% government?"
I agree that's an unfair retort, and it is almost certainly possible to do a lot better than the status quo, along libertarian lines. So now we're arguing instead about magnitudes, i.e. just HOW BAD or HOW GOOD is the government? And I'm saying "I don't know". But I'd argue you don't know either.
However, defending the stance that avoiding taxes is "ethically just" would require absolute certainty in your position, similar to the way religious fundamentalists have absolute certainty. I don't want any part of that.

That's not how the stock market works. The default assumption of market behavior is the "efficient market hypothesis", which means that new information can drastically (and permanently) impact the price.
When Pfizer announces, unexpectedly, that it has discovered a promising new cancer drug, the price will jump sky high all at once. It will only go down again if the news turns out to be wrong or if some unrelated bit of negative news appears. The is no "correction" in this scenario- The new price is the "correct" price, given the positive news.
In the same way, if eBay (unexpectedly) announces the they will adopt bitcoin, the btc price would probably triple within an hour. (again, assuming EMH is correct, which it is in most cases.)

I'm dubious of technical trading, but it's interesting that last week's news has passed and the price has held- This suggests to me that most people in the market now are looking at a month or more for their investing time horizon.
I had expected that the recent price run up was short term speculation, and that we we poised to a fall into the ~300 range by this week. Since this hasn't happened, I've completely changed my mind set and am very bullish now.
Since new players will be coming into the market in the next couple months (I'm expecting a few big wale solo investors and maybe a few hedge funds just dipping their toes in a teensy bit to drive new btc demand) and since there's no evidence of a big sell-off right now, I think there's a good chance we're going to see $1000 coins before the end of the year.
But who knows... just guesses.

The media couldn't talk about bitcoins directly, or they would have gotten letters from uninformed listeners about "hyping ponzi schemes."

I would guess that a major business will see a marketing opportunity in adopting bitcoin- Imagine if some random business like Panera or Noodles&amp;Co starts accepting it: It would cost them next to nothing and immediately give them a blurb in all the major papers... that'll start up the next round of craziness.

I somewhat agree, but the "this time it's totally different" argument is always a dangerous one...
@_date: 2013-04-29 10:15:23
I don't understand what's surprising about this... In Cyprus bank deposits were only insured up to 100k. If you put more than that in a bank there you were essentially an investor in the bank and if the bank goes bankrupt you lose your money- that's what it means not to have any insurance.
In my view this is far preferable to the US system where banks are bailed out to the max and under all circumstances, even if deposits are uninsured.
The whole reason we have people looking at bitcoin and saying "This is stupid nobody needs this" is because our tax dollars are indirect subsidies for our incompetent banking system.

AFAI can tell, the mtgox current price uses the following formula:
1. If the most recent trade price is between the ask and sell prices, use that price
2. If the most recent price is outside of that range, use the average of the ask and sell.
So the reason this happened is because the sellers suddenly  wanted more money, but no buyers were biting, but they DID raise their offers beyond the last trade price. This means the actual price is now essentially impossible to know, so mtgox estimates by averaging the spread among buyers and sellers.
However, since no actual trade happened, the "high" doesn't change.

Bitcoin isn't going to have a 20% growth rate once the value stabilizes- The only way that could happen is if the population grows 20% every year.

Well, like many things bitcoin, it originates from the Austrian school of economics (Hayek, etc) but as I said this is mainly accepted by economists of all bent- For instance, no economist worth their salt will say that the economy will be hurt by raising the federal overnight lending rate, only that it will have a short-term impact on the economy if it was unexpected (this may actually happen this week)
As with our question regarding the savings rate, having a constant savings rate has zero impact on the economy (with simple models) but a CHANGE in the savings rate definitely will, for the short term.
If you want to get a more rounded feel for these issues I highly recommend listening to the entire archives of EconTalk podcast, which has guests from all political persuasions (though the interviewer definitely leans in the libertarian/austrian direction)

You are wrong: The right move in _all situations_ is to spend _some_ money for necessities and to save _some_ for the future: It is never black and white.
So if there is deflation, you would save _a larger percentage_ of that one dollar for the future. The act of saving more of it will make the amount you DID spend worth more, by the exact same amount! (assuming everyone in the economy uses the same rational behavior)

Their own graph seems to show that the recent rise ISN'T being driven up by speculation: Looking at the graph it's clear that the ratio of BTC cost to google searches is the lowest it's ever been- So the value of bitcoins isn't being driven by hype as much as in the past.

Don't listen to the folks suggesting coinbase or bitpay- with all due respect, it's overkill for what you need. Just do the following:
  1. Install a bitcoin wallet on your phone
  2. A bitcoin buyer just takes a snapshot of the qr code on your phone screen and you get a message that the money arrived.

I don't know why the other suggestions are making this so complicated. His mom will probably make like $5/month in bitcoin sales at the beginning, just keep things simple:
1. Install a bitcoin wallet on her phone.
2. Show her how to use preev.com to get the bitcoin price for a purchase.
3. Go to wolframalpha.com and type "[the phone's bitcoin address] qr code" to get the qr code, which you can print out and put next to the cash register.
4. After someone sends her the bitcoins, she'll get an alert on her phone showing that it got there.
She should keep all log of all the sales (including fiat amounts). Then, once a month, give her the cash and take the bitcoins off her hands.
(Now I'll get a slew of replies saying your mom needs to use unique payment addresses for every $2 cup of coffee and how my accounting doesn't take into account bitcoin volatility properly and how you might overpay your mom 10 cents at the end of the month because of this inefficient accounting approach and how OP might not be able to handle the currency hedging risk and how someone could perform a double spending attack when they buy their cup of coffee by not waiting for confirmations.)

You can't simultaneously say that deflation inhibits spending and then also argue that the amount of spending doesn't matter. That's a logical contradiction.
Also, hoarding and spending are not "zero sum": You can have lots of hoarding AND lots of spending simultaneously (if the market cap of the currency is high)
Thinking that you must have hoarding OR spending is the mental error that leads to this confusion people keep having about bitcoin.

Once bitcoin achieves enough adoption, must people won't need to learn about "the blockchain" etc because bitcoin's benefits will be obvious, since people they see on tv won't shut up about it.
Then, all you need to tell them is "Here's your bank account. It has two addresses, one to receive money and one to send money... Don't tell anyone the address for sending money."
It's really very simple to explain once we reach that point.
Before we reach that point, they unfortunately have to learn all that crap, because it's the only way to "get it". But I think we're going to see that there's plenty of smart people willing to learn about "the blockchain" etc because people are always motivated to learn about things that involve money.

It is so obvious to me that that paper is bogus: Let's suppose an entity owns 10% of mining power and mines a "secret block"- There is absolutely no net incentive for other miners to selfishly join this "secret block cabal" because even though a peer's chance of mining a subsequent block will increase tenfold (per unit time) if they join the cabal, the chance of the "secret block" becoming the next "published block" AND there being enough time to find a subsequent block would mathematically always be 1/10th, exactly cancelling out the advantage.
It just SOUNDS like the idea would work, because the probabilities are a bit tough to calculate.

I agree saving accounts still have a benefit over btcs regarding risk. However, I'm not sure the "easy access" part is compelling any more, given the existence of btcs.

Actually, this behavior can be explained almost entirely by the latest statements from Bitcoin Bernanke: 
The fact is that the Federal Bitcoin Reserve was meeting this week, and seasoned bitcoiners were worried in the run up that there was going to be a surprise liquidity injection into the system. Luckily, Bitcoin Bernanke and the reserve decided NOT to inject extra BTCs, so the price of bitcoins entered a rally.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:49:04
Also, in the hearing this week it was stated clearly that the IRS was currently working on a guidance document for bitcoins. Anyone who owns bitcoins in the US will probably want to read that document. Hopefully it'll be hard to miss on r/bitcoin when it's available.

I think it is more likely that the purchasing power of bitcoins would decrease in a recession. I think a basic economic model would predict:
recession-&gt;lower productivity-&gt;lower supply of goods-&gt;harder to buy things (with traditional money OR bitcoin, doesn't matter)
The steps above would DEFINITELY happen. It's possible the value of bitcoin would increase ON TOP of this basic model and flip the results, but there would be a specific cause of this value increase which would be independent of the recession (fear of the government, greater media coverage of bitcoin, etc)

The answer is that there are two SLOW reasons for increased btc demand, and one FAST reason.
The SLOW ones are:
   1. People are using bitcoins instead of dollars (currency)
   2. People are using bitcoins instead of gold (commodity)
These haven't happened yet, since they're slow.
The FAST one is:
    3. People speculate that the slow ones have a chance of happening in the future.
THAT is the reason the demand has skyrocketed.

What I meant in my brief comment is that bitcoins (and copycats) do not fail for any of the obvious reasons that people use to dismiss attempts at a cybercurrency. This means it has great security, no central point of failure, has found minimal adoption, has a credible system for limiting supply, and has an established valuation.
It is the first cybercurrency to pass this basic threshold and is now in uncharted territory, in terms of its potential success.
It could certainly still be a total flop, but if that happens it will almost certainly be a flop for *different reasons* than previous attempts at a cyber currency. That's what makes it interesting.

The mistake this guys makes is that he envisions bitcoin as a layer on top of the dollar (a conceptual error on his part)
Hence, he thinks it's not a unit of measure (because you can measure with the underlying dollar, instead) he thinks it's not a unit of exchange (because its easier to just exchange the underlying dollars with a bank wire) and... well, he has to admit you could store bitcoins (since he realizes people store other things than dollars like gold, so his usual line of attack doesn't apply)
Sure, if you look at bitcoins this way (which is wrong, wrong, wrong) then the dollar will always come out on top.

If I can make a suggestion: I think it will be hard to make a good film about bitcoin, specifically. This is because most of the folks involved in the technology are well-off middle class people and the subject matter is too specific and esoteric for a general audience.
If I were you I'd cover a broader subject: The recent re-emergence of anarcho-capitalism: Bitcoin, Valve, Wikileaks, and the internet as a whole are versions of this. If you do that you can find many more compelling stories (because of the broader scope and the fact that anyone who's hit hardships because of the government or large corporations is relevant to the discussion.) It's amazing that no movie has covered this subject in any detail yet.
This way, you can still discuss bitcoin but also place it into a more compelling narrative that affects the average person more directly.

I'm not sure your premise regarding the motivation of banks rings true...
Are you saying most people that deposit money in savings accounts at banks right now do so because of the wonderful interest they earn? That doesn't make sense: To me, it looks more like people put money into savings accounts SOLELY because they don't want it stolen from under their mattress.
Hence, bitcoin appears to be a direct threat to the business model of tradional banks. Why would most bankers have any love for bitcoin?

Very simple: Assuming bitcoins continue to stay alive, speculators will eventually drive the price to staggeringly high prices, where they plateau (after much volatility first).
This price will be SO HIGH that most bitcoin holders will think "OK, this is finally it. It can't get much higher than this." I don't know what that price is: It could be anywhere from $200 to $500000 or more. But whatever it is it will be "irrationally high" to many people.
With a price that high, it will be irrelevant that there's 2% or whatever deflation because of population growth. Then, it will work exactly the way you want:
  1. The price remains stable
  2. People can use it as a liquid currency

The original crash in 2011 was due to serious software flaws in online exchanges that made many believe that a cryptocurrency might not be tenable. This was wrong of course (the software in the exchanges have nothing to do with the btc protocol) but a loss in faith in the entire "concept" of bitcoins hit the price very, very hard.
Something like this could happen again, if MtGox has another catastrophic failure and starts leaking BTCs. Or, it would definitely happen if someone DOES figure out a lethal hack for the btc protocol (though at this point this seems unlikely...) Either one of those could flatline the btc price (less so with the first one) but I think the odds for this are small.

I would say it's biggest threat right now is that new users feel like "chumps" because they have to spend money on something that cost 90% less a year ago. This is (wait for it) because of the deflationary nature of bitcoins.
deflation isn't a problem in itself (I agree with other bitcoiners that deflation is fine in terms of macroeconomics) but means adoption will be slowed.
If someone else comes up with a cryptocurrency that has some inflation built in it could overtake bitcoins (again, not because deflation is "bad" but simply because it has negative psychological consequences for new users that slows adoption.)

This isn't a problem, from a theoretical standpoint.
All you have to do is set up a sales tax: Eventually you need to buy a donut with your BTCs, so the government can make the donut shop pay 20% of the payment as tax. This can be done without having to audit the blockchain.
For businesses that operate entirely in the bitcoin realm (i.e. the SatoshiDices of the world) they get to be tax free. But eventually you'll have to buy a donut from your SD winnings (and the owner of SD will need to buy his donut, too.)

Unfortunately, a small percent of people are at risk of getting addicted to things and pointing them at resources to help is in the community's interest.

The value of a currency is indirectly proportional to its liquidity.
In a deflationary environment it is true there would be less money changing hands through lending. However, the money that does change hands will have a higher value, so that the amount of money lent (measured in terms of value) will remain constant.
(i'm not saying this argument is a certainty, as I mentioned all complex arguments I've seen so far relating to monetary policy seem pretty dubious to me.)

Black market goods are more expensive because the supply dwindles faster than the demand when they are outlawed.

1. How do I know the private key that's generated by the device was created on the spot and not pre-generated by the bitcointrezor guys ahead of time? (Saying it's "open source" doesn't really help, since you guys are producing the hardware as well which may have stuff hardcoded into it.)
2. Can I view the private key used by the device? (hopefully the answer is "no", both for ease of use and security)
3. What mechanism is used for making sure no money is lost if my bitcointrezor dies? (What would be awesome is if there was some way of having multiple bitcoin trezors that are guaranteed to have the same key, so there's redundancy.)

Well, maybe you shouldn't be on TV then as a financial expert and commenting on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:20:24
Look, I was probably being a bit harsh in my other comment... I actually find EMH to be useful as a "null hypothesis" for financial modeling.
Let me put it this way:
If you are trying to predict that btc will fall, you have to put forth a model that predicts that btc will fall. You have hypothesized that EMH was followed in the past. Also, you have given a model for the price increase (more people learning the benefit of btc).
However, your post uses these two models to claim that the price will FALL, but neither of these models can predict a FALL in price. Even if your claim is that EMH will be followed again in the future, this is not a model that would predict a fall (since EMH always predicts an average, net price change of zero)

To me (the guy who drew the diagram) it means bitcoins are going to keep becoming more popular and valuable but will do so with an erratic pattern.
This is because every time bitcoin increases in popularity it activates a negative feedback loop (a response from the volatility) that takes some time to work its way through the system.

I know I will probably get downvoted into oblivion for this, but it is unlikely if you accept bitcoin that you're going to close a significant number of additional sales. At this early stage, expecting a quick ROI is not a good reason for supporting bitcoins at a FTSE 100 scale.
In my opinion, however, bitcoin technology is arguably the greatest invention of the last few years. Naturally its superior nature, in itself, does not guarantee it will be successful (just as Betamax lost out to VHS) but your company will look extremely visionary in the future if you become an early adopter in 2013. Additionally, you could have an early mover advantage over your competitors (once it does garner wider adoption) that would be lucrative to you long term.
The problems of volatility arise from the small size of the current bitcoin marketplace. The volatility will become minimal if bitcoin reaches mainstream success.
Finally, if you look more into it, you'll see that bitcoin is much easier to implement than other payment systems like paypal- That's part of what makes the system so brilliant. Therefore, you may be overestimating the costs involved in supporting it.
In my view, that is the "lay of the land" right now and these are the arguments you need to be mulling over to decide whether to support bitcoin.

I don't think you understand the point of OP: If you own a bitcoin address (i.e. only you know the private key) this is the purest form of ownership possible. If you own property, it's more of a partial sort of ownership with all kinds of caveats.
If the government decides they want some of my bitcoins, they can't just take them as they can with land. (Or as you like to say "buy it from me and then force me to pay them the money they just gave me")

Overall, it just looks like an embarrassing form letter by someone who has no idea how to do his job.

You and me both- I think I am going to submit a "bitbet.us" bet for this right now actually. (done.)

The question was how the government will argue the need to regulate bitcoin. This is separate from the issue as to whether this argument is "right" or "fair" or "logical".

What?? You think we can conjure up money out of thin air or something?

Looks cool- you should put something in the subreddit bar making it clear that it's for "people who write for bitcoins" not "people who write about bitcoins".

"Power" in government (and in bitcoins) is a difficult thing to quantify... I concede you make a good point though.
That said, in some cases we still don't know just how powerful presidential advisers may have been... Dick Cheney springs to mind.

I'm not an iPhone guy, but I think blockchain.info has a good app for iOS.

Probably just a factor of having limited time for answers in a TV show.

the latter.

Well, I think you can have both at the same time. The 266 spike was about as classic of a bubble phenomenon as you can find (but was then followed by a nice stable price cushion from all the long term adopters)
