Might as well...

Thanks for doing this

Not only that, but BitFloor's fees were better than CampBX for deposits, withdrawals, and trading.

Does it matter? Plenty of people play on other poker websites for USD

Forgot the link

I believe it still requires an ID to set up ACH

Hell, one transfer from blockchain had a 0.05 transfer fee attached to it for me. All I gather from that is blockchain may be more secure but transaction fees can really add up.

I transferred from blockchain to bitfloor 2 hours before that, never got any confirmations, recently saw that the transaction got cancelled. Attempting to transfer to another wallet now.

Despite having the "generous" transaction fee, my transfer using blockchain wallet still is still unconfirmed after 2 hours, yet a transfer from BitZino took about half hour for 6 confirmations. I guess blockchain is getting swamped.

You don't use RES? What's wrong with you?

Online subscriptions (in general) with bitcoins sounds like a great idea. I've signed up for far too many websites that I've forgotten to cancel.

Signed up, quick and easy. Thanks.

I agree with all that, except privacy seems higher with a bank to me. Unless you're careful with your btc account address, anyone can know how much you have.

I used it to buy awhile back as BitInstant to MTGox seems like the easiest way to buy, not being around a BoA. 
I'm sure most people use it as it looks like a very professional site and people often think the most popular is the best.

The current price means just about nothing right now. If people can't transfer coins, they can't sell them.

I use [Bitcoinium]( The market graphs don't update the fastest, but the widget seems to work well.

Sounds like I need to spend some time on Omegle

Not 100% on all of them, but they at least worked a week ago.
However I stopped using most of them. Satoshis paid out became lower as the price increased and I turned to  which makes you do a lil work, but easily pays out more in an hour than using all of those sites for a week, despite the price changes. Although looking at bitcoinget.com, the price per task hasn't increased despite the price drop.
Regardless, you won't make much more than millibitcoins at most from the faucets. I managed to scrap up a few bitcents (centibitcoins?) from bitcoinget from a week's worth of work, and made a good amount off BitZino from betting microbitcoins til it added up.

Looks like the transaction was cancelled, oh well, still got my coins
