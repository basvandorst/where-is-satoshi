Crypto anarchy looks an awful lot like antisocial parasitism, oddly enough.

That argument will hold water when you can buy a cup of coffee or a computer with a price denominated in Bitcoin, not USD, and not a second before.

The dollar’s inflation rate went *down* after the financial crisis, you moron.

[You do not need to be indoctrinated by mainstream finance to look at this graph and see that it goes down, not up, around 2008.](

Ethereum's down nearly as much as Bitcoin in the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:00:56
how much did you have to sell below the price you bought in at and how much above?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:18:41
Have you, in total, got more fiat from selling bitcoin than you spent buying it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:59
The only way you've got more fiat is through someone else getting less fiat so it's more likely than you'd think.

Right, so the goalposts have moved from ‘bank bailouts cause hyperinflation’ to ‘bank bailouts don’t reduce inflation enough to cause deflation’ now.


[Shadowstats’ inflation stats also show a reduction in inflation after the crisis and bailouts lmaooo](


maybe you should learn to read and count before telling me to listen

Have you ever looked at the volume numbers for USDT on coinmarketcap? Almost nobody was trading it for USD on Kraken anyway; it won't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:27:00
Sure. But he only managed that by selling to a greater fool; it's straightforward mathematics that he must be in the minority.

The pressures in the Bitcoin economy have historically not been away from concentration of wealth. And the mesh network still has the fatal flaw of an unsolved routing problem.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:17:53
There is literally a [central governing body]( of internet routing.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:26:01
They do, however, have a somewhat tractable routing problem, which is something that Lightning advocates just handwave for the mesh network.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:45:04
I'm not the person to ask if you want deep analysis of it! Think about it, though, how do you get your internet connection? Probably from a cable running into your house from your ISP's network, or from a cell tower. Those are big, expensive pieces of infrastructure, and I think they're centralised mostly for the same reason the gas and water and electric supplies are. The Lightning network essentially can't be peer-to-peer for similar reasons: setting up channels is very costly (a blockchain transaction fee from both parties plus locking up the funds) and finding routes of several hops across a constantly-shifting decentralised network topology is, as far as anyone's been able to show, impossible.

have you literally ever sold bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:12:45
If you’re looking at a price index that includes Bitfinex you’re looking at bogus numbers. Bitfinex does not have a BTCUSD pair, only BTCUSDT, and the fact that it’s trading more than $300 higher than exchanges that deal in real dollars like GDAX reflects this.

Opening a connection in the BitTorrent and Bitcoin protocols doesn't cost $10. It doesn't require you to time-lock your money into it. Blockstream have, I've heard, projected blockchain transaction fees as high as $100.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:34:09


Internet routing is about the furthest thing from peer-to-peer imaginable.

I said, at the start, that nobody invests in dollars the way Bitcoiners 'invest' in Bitcoin. You've still shown no evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:30:40
I do, which is why I can tell the difference between keeping cash as a stock of liquid capital and keeping it as an investment.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:09:10
It's going to be pretty much zero because he isn't a forex trader, and because dollars are inflationary and so are worse than useless as an investment. It would really behoove you guys to learn the *slightest goddamn thing* about the system you think your wonder-currency is going to beat.

And indeed only a total fucking idiot would invest in USD.
