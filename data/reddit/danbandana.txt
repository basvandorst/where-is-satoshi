Coinbase Pro released an app when the website works perfectly fine and formats perfectly in mobile web browsers.

I use BlockFi, which offers one free withdrawal per month, and compound interest (which Celsius doesn't.) Doing pretty good with it so far.

Hell, this post isn't even about Bitcoin at all.

That chart assumes that the price of Bitcoin will steadily rise continuously over the year. I'm not saying McAfee will be right on his prediction (although I'd love it if he was) but if one were to believe/hope he's right it could be possible for Bitcoin to drop here and there as it has, and rise exponentially in the future. But probably not.
To answer your original question of what I'd do, my answer is "Not much." I'd keep holding.

The only poor store of value around here is Forbes itself.

Nope. You need to deposit from regular to pro. And it puts them on hold for days when I try.

They take some practice. Look up some youtube videos on drawing them and get to work. There are some pretty good tutorials on there. I've actually been doing the same thing lately, since hands aren't my strongest suit.

Regarding B: They don't have be talking about Bitcoin. But if people search for blockchain, they're going to bound to find something on bitcoin and then search that, as well. Maybe,

This sort of thing is part of Bitcoin’s future. As exposure increases, more and more people will hear about these defi platforms and start using them. Not everybody. Many will prefer the security of a hardware wallet or whatever, and they’re smart for it. But those less involved will be attracted to interest rates better than their banks. This will likely start to turn heads among the banks, who may even try to compete. 
At the end of the day: fuck banks, but scaring them into competing with Bitcoin isn’t a bad thing.

Coinbase gives me such a hard time with my B of A account. Every few transactions it starts rejecting me and I have to delete and re-add my account again to get it to work. Have you tried re-adding your card/account?

Nobody forgot why Bitcoin was invented. Sit down.

I started depositing my bitcoin in BlockFi. I'm sure that's not a very popular opinion on here, what with the whole "Not your keys, not your coins" deal, but I'm willing to take the risk. 6.2% interest, compounded monthly, and paid out in bitcoin. Feels like a real savings account.

Maybe it'll make people start thinking twice before dropping 5-7 bucks on a Frappuccino every morning.

I've bought Bitcoin several times without asking that question.
@_date: 2019-10-29 00:18:43
Not really any taxes until you withdraw and cash out for fiat, I imagine.
BlockFi makes their money by lending your money to other investors, similarly to banks. The interest they make back goes in part to you. They are supposedly insured.

It's immediate for you? Because I try buying USDC and transferring that to Pro, but it takes several days to release my USDC for withdrawal. Is there another way to deposit USD (immediately) that I'm missing?
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:20:12
Cash App, Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Binance, Kraken, Gemini are among more popular platforms. Just look up their fee structure and shop around.
Don't use Robinhood, since they don't let you hold your own bitcoin.
