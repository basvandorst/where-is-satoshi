I understand that. Bitcoin changes extremely rapidly, but an incredibly small market share and a primarily speculative market is what's driving that. The USD is the reserve currency of the world, of course it will remain relatively stable. But the basic economic concepts of inflation/deflation/purchasing power still seemed to have been missed upon those gentlemen.

Thanks, I would've never known based on the context of his sentence and the fact that only two letters are switched. Hodor is a character in Game of Thrones, it was a joke.

I facepalmed so hard when they said fiat doesn't change in value. Our country would do a lot better if people understood concepts such as purchasing power.

I mean, you could just as easily have malware that steals your identity. Which, even with fraud protection, can be a real blow to your financials if it wrecks your credit.
And if some mugger holds a knife to you, no ones getting you your cash back either.

If you're applying for a loan though, with 0 credit, but you have at least a year of rent checks (preferably memo'd), utility payments, etc, the underwriters will typically accept these as lines of credit that can help you get your loan.

Yes, but ecstasy became tainted as more and more knock offs and mixtures came out. Bunk pills, other drugs, etc. It also more specifically refers to the pills in the 90s when the term became popular that were usually mdma mixed with amphetamines and caffeine (if you got the good ones). 
After awhile though, other crap got added and people started calling pure MDMA powder/crystal molly.
Which of course, has now been bastardized and you get methylone a lot and other white powders that lookalike. 
tl;dr relying on a name alone is bad use chemical testers

Aren't you being greedy though?

You're talking about 75k a year for doing absolutely nothing because it's pure interest. I think if you have a few kids to raise, being able to spend that much time with them might provide more value than money ever would, my friend.

I commend you for going as far as you have to deal with such thickness. He's basically just arguing that the number 1 50 years ago is equal to the number 1 today. 
Which is true, and he's very proud of knowing this, but it's so totally irrelevant to the relative worth (also a definition of value) that it was really difficult to read his replies.

No, stop processing payments until your buggy systems are fixed. I seriously hear too many instances of this, and working in software, clearly ya'll are fucking up. Your comment history is literally nothing but "Please log your issue @ support".

A net worth of $150k is more than the average American mate. Much, much more. You have to account for the fact that nearly everyone has a student loan payments, car payment, housing payment, etc. Oh, and that the majority of Americans make less than $100k yearly. He's got 150k in cash (well, close to it). That's doing pretty well for the vast majority of the country. 
Your perception of actual wealth is either skewed by your upbringing, your locale, or the media.

Depends on whether or not you've backed up... you could have fifty of those things in safety deposit boxes across the country. Burn that money and there's nothing because it was just paper.

Fossil fuels are currently required to maintain the logistics of the food supply. You lose that and there's suddenly a lot of hungry mouths with no land to grow food on.

You're again using only one definition of the word "value", a very hard definition. Again, I refer to one of Merriam Webster's definitions in which it defines value as  "relative worth, utility, or importance".
Let's again, using Merriam Webster define "worth":


And the world relative: 


A one dollar bill yes, has the value of one dollar. However, due to inflation, it's relative worth, and therefore it's value in comparison to hard objects has decreased. Your dollar has the value of a dollar, yes, but it also has value in terms of what you can actually trade your dollar for. 
Therefore, if, due to inflation, the relative worth or value of your dollar has changed.
You need to distinguish between the *face* value of a dollar which, yes, never changes, and the *purchasing* value of a dollar, which is what counts and *does* change.

He did it on a test network, not the real chain.
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:53:04
Your point is irrelevant. You're basically saying that the numerical value one will still be the numerical value one fifty years ago, fifty years in the future, and now. This is true, but it is completely irrelevant when discussing the actual *value* of the $1 dollar. This is rude, but that is a very, very stupid point to argue. 
Value being defined by [Merriam Webster]( as: 


Therefore, due to inflation, your $1 dollar is not the same as $1 dollar fifty years ago, because the relative worth of $1 dollar 50 years ago was substantially higher. You could buy more with it than you can today. 
Your issue is refusing to see any of the  several other definitions for the word value. You're using:


 Yes, the value of $1 dollar on the note is still numerically 1 unit, but the value in trade economics, which is what counts here, has changed.

That's why China and Russia are doing everything in their power to move away from USD as the reserve currency. They don't want to be on the hook for our politicians bad decisions.

Yep, this guy's got it right. You watch the productivity index soar higher, with no gains for the public's wages... so where's that profit going?
