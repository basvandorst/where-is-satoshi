apples and oranges, silly.

But is this a discussion solely over the renaming of a satoshi, or is it fundamentally a discussion about technical specification of a satoshi (and therefore will warrant a renaming)?

Yeah, I'm not sure he really understands how bitcoin works
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:03:01
good points. God damn. there is so much to learn.

Where in Spain are you? A group of us are starting a Bitcoin Workshop in Valencia.

where is this 'bit' conversation coming from? It has just crept up on me
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:42:29
Thanks for the article you linked me, solid advice. thank you

Nothing useful to say but kudos to you! You guys have taken the technology of decentralised consensus and meshnets to a level WAAAAAAAAY beyond my intelligence barrier, while still respecting my rights, freedoms, liberties and morals. You probably aren't being thanked for it enough, but you are really making tomorrow's world a better place, in ways that you probably can't even imagine yet!

sorry man, searched this sub for bitstamp, it didn't come up.

No, it's just that I've been doing my research, and I keep seeing stuff like, app/service X is compromised, random X exchange just mysteriously went offline with everyone's coins, i've got 2fa and still got hacked, e.t.c.
1 question, If i make a paper wallet, and put the wallet in a safe place. Can I still check on my funds and check confirmations without having to open my wallet?

I'm in Murcia (just below Alicante) I'll deliver a pizza to you for some bitcoin ;)

This is going to sound controversial, but, don't worry. If you really think the product's fate comes down to how it's presented, then you had a shitty product in the first place.
Bitcoin is fundamentally a solid idea. It will win eventually, and it won't be because of the Bitcoin Foundation

Hi Guys, this is all insanely complex and wonderful, There is a TED talk out there, if I remember correctly, about how new things gain popularity and how it follows a bell curve.
The point it was trying to make was how there is a very important demographic (just at the beginning of the ascent to peak popularity) that you need to capture, and that is the enthusiastic, daring demography that keep their eye on shiny new things, but have very little insider knowledge.
That's me! I just want to say that while you guys are borderline geniuses, I am borderline imbecile. Just getting into Bitcoin (and by that I mean downloading an online wallet and ignorantly la-la-la'ing over any security concerns) was an ordeal enough. Please please make openbazaar SUUUPER easy and comfortable for the SUUPPPER stupid. Remember, as a seller, if I put up a product for sale, then I will still have to convince those even dumber than me to jump on the Bitcoin/OpenBazaar bandwagon.
So If I must ask a question... Captain Planet, or Power Rangers?

right, but doesn't innocent until proven guilty protect us here?
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:00:08
Eh? I'm a noob, can you explain why address reuse is bad? Isn't putting funds into a paper wallet address reuse!?

Stop getting dragged into this dogfight already. It's boring. Besides, if one currency wins, we all win. End of.

Can't wait for the romance part... Boy this is thrilling!

Agreed. I think we are all looking for the perfect solution, but unfortunately that may not exist (yet).
But let's look at Bittorrent, it has perfectly legal applications, and so therefore all users of bittorrent aren't by default criminals.
We will never know what the percentage of 'criminal' activity is among Dark Wallet users, and it has perfectly legal applications too.
Thirdly, I think the guarantee of anonymity is the safety net that protects us from any legal repercussions, since they won't be able to find those users that use it in the first place. (Although how willing am I to place the my trust in an alleged guarantee of anonymity?)

Yeah, Bitcoin, Dodgecoin. I'm cool with either brand, really.
edit: Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:41:00
what's your technique, bro?
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:49:36
Good plan. I'm in Cartagena and right now is the town's festival. It's really huge. It's theme is based around an old battle that took place between the Romans and the Carthaginians, so if you come this week / next weekend (Best over the weekend), you'll see tonnes of beautiful Mediterranean women (or men, if that's your thing) dressed up in sexy togas/costumes. There's also a massive street party (that more resembles a festival campsite) in the centre where about 4k young people come together to do nothing but stand around, and drink and party. It's a sight you have to see/experience.
