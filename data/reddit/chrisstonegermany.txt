@_date: 2019-11-27 17:54:37
They asked me about Bitcoin, i told them. I am polite.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:55:18
Bitcoin is a big thing in Turkey

Chance of the value of your holdings to go to the moon: Bitcoin 50%, paypal 0%
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:00:19
Beautiful idea, but widen up the gaps at the higher numbers please. Its only a 7% gap between 55k and 60k...7% is a matter of some good hours...dont stop at 100k....bitcoin wont stop at 100k either
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:51:46
Even talking about turkey is dangerous these days with Erdogan and Syria and the Kurds
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:03:23
1k per wallet was my limit too...in the beginning....its impossible as soon as you have some winner coins
@_date: 2019-08-07 06:52:54
Look deeper on the chart....there are the other 2 lines
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:53:40

@_date: 2019-08-08 07:32:24
Got the mistake...Pricing changed from Dollar to Euros ....et voila 10% down
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:10:34
6.15 BTC is quite an amount for a surfing duck
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:04:20

@_date: 2019-04-02 07:43:03
You mean 800 guys with bitcoins asking the same dumb questions? Well, maybe ... but it looks more like a technical bitcoin jump above the longterm downtrend in my eyes
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:44:35
Thats not much?
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:59:12
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:38:43
If you look at the chart it looks like an outbreak above the downward trendline since spring 2018.

@_date: 2019-05-11 10:28:55
You are heading in the right direction! And the next time you have some money left over think twice...dont buy useless shit products...buy a little more bitcoin on top of your pile and then wait for some years. This ride isnt over till in 10 years or so. Even small amounts will make a great return if your lucky.
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:40:05
I bought 2 hours ago...no pants shitted until now...if bitcoin would be under 1000 Dollars...maybe then i start shitting pants a little bit 
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:25:24
If Bitcoins hits 100k Dollar its because of new investors with REALLY big money (banks, billionaires, countries, investment funds) try to buy us early investors out of the market. And sure that means that everyone who sells 10 bitcoins or more is then a millionaire. Isnt so unlikely if bitcoin stays healthy.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:32:30
No, i just googled the name and only found some man who lived a 100 years ago.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:54:55

Nice one, so you think we will be all rich ten years from now?
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:28:08
But if you have your private keys on your own?
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:06:32
Its just a sixbread
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:14:30
200k because of the market capitalization it has to get relative to other investment classes
@_date: 2019-05-24 12:58:16
I never had the chance to become a millionaire if i wouldnt be able to invest longterm.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:49:16
Well, maybe because i never was in an english speaking country
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:41:41
And maybe every week when bitcoin goes up
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:40:31
So its a matter of education? or just a lack of getting anything. Because, if its education, then at least academics have to get the  potential of Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:24:56
The same at my working place. Most people there have a mindset like "Bitcoin? OMG! Child porn, taxing problems, fraud, numbers...like hell"
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:00:57
Espacially the younger ones who will shape the future of online payments and bitcoin investments.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:10:24

@_date: 2019-05-12 16:31:11
Only bitcoin is bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:05:39
I have some like Trezor, Ledger Nano, Archos mini safe-t and keepkey and it wasnt very funny to make them work. Its still a long way to go to make them userfriendly

Yes, hodl her. She knows whats good
@_date: 2019-05-29 16:03:05
But not officially
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:08:04
Thats the right direction
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:17:47
Great analysis
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:18:08
So spreading horror stories keeps demand low? Must be a big business for Bitcoin price control then.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:58:21

2024 247,000
Uppsss...do not tell these numbers to bitcoin owners who live in 2019 or before...it might disturb the flow of time
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:17:34
Do you have some friend in your family or at work who can help you in the beginning to get things started?
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:50:09

@_date: 2019-05-16 08:15:44
He is capable of crushing 5 digit numbers...look at that power
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:45:11
The right people dont answer...they dont even listen
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:38:26
So its a problem that the normal people still have no feeling of safety when they buy BTC ?
There must be solutions coming up for this
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:18:11
I was ecstatic...it was a hell of a ride...and 2019 looks like the beginning of a new one
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:43:00

We just reached the stratosphere....Long way to go to the moon
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:39:58
There are many who bought in at the end of 2017 at high prices and that hurts
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:29:43
Real HODLers have arm muscles of steel
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:30:24
So its still time for the risk takers to buy until the fund managers wait until they have figured out how to secure their future assets?
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:18:11
China does not ban anything....officially
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:52:10
Only 6 million? Damn, thats close to nothing if you consider that many bitcoin owners do have dozens of seperate addresses with over 100 USD

The hooks of rich or rot
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:22:27
Wait for the USD 60000 and start selling ...and then buy back when the next 80% drop hits the market
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:36:10
But didnt Bitcoin do well in countries that have economic downturns?
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:53:10
Ah, thats what you use paperwallets for
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:07:31
Well said. Thats the way to make money. Problems are opportunities
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:59:31
Open up a new reddit post with your main question as a headline and there will sure be some response from the guys who know the game

But it isnt 94 in the Bitcoin universe its more like 2002 i would say
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:26:34
He only checks his bitcoins when they are up
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:36:05
So, the big money comes in when you just have to press some shiny button on your mobile to buy bitcoin securely?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:35:12
Do not give up. Its worth some time, money and brain
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:08:13
Yeah, Satoshi you little Babymaker!
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:10:06
394% up.....if the USA starts to buy bitcoin to replace its gold reserves
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:12:01
So you want to mine bitcoins? Then i cant try to help. I can only try to help you if you want to INVEST in bitcoin or other crypto currencies
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:22:52
So if the banks roll in and say to their customers "You dont need understanding of bitcoin and research and grasping anything. Just tell us, that we have to buy it for you and we put it in your bank account...big money floods in?
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:58:29
i love this upward trend
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:42:26
Sounds to me like thats the beginning of "Idiocracy" the movie going on in real life.
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:06:26
You make your guess on factors like market capitalization ?
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:09:41
This monkey rocks! HODL on
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:47:25
That was my second month with cryptos...and i started with The Dao and Ether...if i knew i would have bought more
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:38:31
Yes, it feels like 2017 but lets hope there will be no more 2018 after that
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:11:59
Ohhh..ok..im shifting from bitcoin to JustinBiberCoin now...
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:16:15
Thanks, i give it a try
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:27:04
Maybe some millions...but only a few
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:12:17
The same at my working place. They do not even have some hundred Euros for investing. At the beginning i thought it was a joke but it isnt
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:16:23
Be proud that you live in a country where you are allowed to buy bitcoin without your bank account getting shut down. Because shutting down the account would be a sign of a money dictatorship.
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:14:45
Well i am amazon customer for 20 years and have bought shares of their stock. Also a bubble?

@_date: 2019-05-24 15:45:56
Then, why are WE into bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:30:32
Do they live paycheck to paycheck?
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:13:04
Pure quality
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:51:15
Cash works fine as a payment but it lacks as store of wealth i'd say. So they already have the need for gold, stocks, bitcoin and so on
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:10:06

@_date: 2019-05-03 22:53:34
Bitcoin is the original crypto coin. No other coin can ever claim that. Even it might be a better designed coin. Like Leonardos Mona Lisa is the original drawing. No other Mona Lisa can ever claim that. Being the original can be a very valuable fact.
