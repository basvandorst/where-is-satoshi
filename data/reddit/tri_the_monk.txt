Sorry man she's an only child
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:23:47
I shall keep that in mind, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:44:58
Yeah, I just asked her about it and she said it was about a dollar. Thank you for the advise
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:15:46
If it makes money in the end, then I'm sure she would be happy with your choice
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:35:25
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:08:38
I appreciate your input and the polite way in which you phrased it
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:31:44
I really hope that my home doesn't burn down, but that's what insurance is for.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:49:45
Thank you very much for your advice, I will look into it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:39
Everyone should Hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:21:55
Maybe on that day I shall, but until then I'm afraid that it will have to be shrouded in mystery. Even if you have a lot, you worked hard for it in some way and you should keep it until it is worth more than you ever dreamed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:37:20
Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:53
That's great to hear, I hope your investments prove fruitful
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:02:40
Idk, about bitcoin investing, but there's a financial advisor above that gave me advise on using the stock market for retirement planning, which I will be looking into
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:08
I didn't know there was a term for it, but now I do, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:21:57
Well if want to "blow" your money then I would encourage doing something fun, coke and stripper's asses not withholding
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:38:11
Are you that jaded? Relax man
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:05:35
Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:44
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:36:00
Thank you she really is
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:55:24
We're gonna bring it all dowwwwwnnnn
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:59
She is, thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:53:19
That's awesome, I'll look into it
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:41:13
Thank you very much for this information, seriously. We're going to do some reading Tonight
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:44
don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
Yes, I know it's the same copy and pasted reply to these, but I do mean it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:11:56
Without a wallet address how can they find it? This is a real question
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:25:19
Thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:38
That's Wonderful hear, I hope that you guys continue to work together and have fun doing it!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:04:30
No, why would it be?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:54
Curses you've seen through my ploy to wait for bitcoin to increase in value again
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:09:36
I did in many ways
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:35
I was amused at your auto cannibalism story because it was so farfetched.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:19:02
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:17:48
Then I wait until they get greedy again lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:09:09
And you're an angry person. Try having a better day tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:33
I will check it out when I get home from work, thank you. In the meantime is there any information that you can give for it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:08:12
Okay, thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:59
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:21:48
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:43:45
Goodness you are such an angry person. Unfortunately I have been trolled by better, fight the good fight precious.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:14:55
You're right, we'll do that asap. Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:13:43
Well there's always time to buy back in later
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:31:42
Thank you, I agree
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:35:38
Okay, so what would be a good amount to transfer at? When bitcoin reaches 100k next week?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:55:40
I appreciate it
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:09:32
Thank you, I will check them out
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:12:11
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:34:15
If it keeps going up, then maybe rich student income one day soon
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:33:25
An iPhone 5s, that we got almost 4 years ago for less than $100, there is no monthly payment for her phone you silly goober.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:10:33
Aww, but why did you delete your far-fetched comment? The only one mad here is you and you have devoted a large amount of time to let everyone know. Take a trip on over to and have a smile
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:44:09
Well since the price has dropped again not very much, but we are hopeful that it will go back up and become something better
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:51
Ex-wife or no, that was a very nice gesture
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:08:08
That was exactly my point, the emotional value far out weighs the monetary value
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:31:28
It's the coinbase app
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:16:04
Lol I'm sure she would share some
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:03:24
Just because you aren't making $100,000 doesn't mean it won't make you money. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:19
I believe you misunderstood and are over reacting. This about the emotional value gained, not the monetary. I have both a 401k and a tsp account (yes with employer matching) I just wanted to share. Smile don't frown.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:13
My wife took the screenshot on her iPhone 5s, I'm unable to do it on my droid turbo
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:58:27
is just mad that he bought lemon flavor haterade instead of orange. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:00:25
Yes .00184964btc 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:32:33
Isn't that the thing to do after 20 years
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:20:15
She really is, the best marriage is one that is a friendship as well
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:34:36
It's only been about $1 per transaction so a total of 3 maybe 4 dollars for fees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:48:43
I don't believe that it is
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:06:07
mmmm I think this is orange flavor hatorade
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:42:06
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:56:51
We will certainly try
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:19:09
Yeahhhhhhhh, she got brownie points for days
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:17:11
Man, that was one wild comment, but a bit too crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:03:55
Nice! We have to start somewhere!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:26
An iPhone that cost less than $100 that we got almost 4 years ago. Yes, again, as in I have purchased bitcoins previously, sold them off quite a while ago, and wished to start the process again. Seriously though, I wanted to shared a smile, if you still think it's a tarp then I hope that you have a better happier day tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:17
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:47:48
I think that phone is almost worthless at this point, she's had it for almost 4 years
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:44:39
Well then I hope that happens
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:14:15
I try to treat her the best I can
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:10
See you in a year
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:45:30
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:20:23
It's one of the sweetest things anyone has ever done for me
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:33:30
I believe that person is out there for everyone, but the search is different
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:15:43
I shall check it out asap. Any recommendations on alternatives?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:38
Exactly, I never gotten anything back from those
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:07:52
Yes, I understand, thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:34
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:02
My wife took the screenshot on her iPhone 5s and sent it to me
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:31:02
Just like Fry, you'll have to kill me for it! I propose a duel, pistols at a number of paces set by the current value of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:29:38
If you guys keeping raising the price of btc it will be
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:31
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:22:56
Save it, you never know when you might need it for something important
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:55:05
Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:07:34
Yeah, we just learned about gdax, we're going to check it out later and keep trying to add small amounts
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:35
I don't see that as a reason not to tell her everything, if I tell her everything I feel that she'll be more apt to stay, whereas keeping her in the dark would make her feel as though she doesn't know me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:56:53
Well I didn't post it for tips. I did it to share the nice thing my wife did for us to brighten my day.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:06:28
Mah man *fist bump*
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:15
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:13:07
She said it wasn't that high
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:24:28
No, you can buy whatever percentage of a bitcoin that you desire. You aren't stupid, you just didn't know, but now you did
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:05:19
And that's why you deleted it? So no one else could read it? All the while posting dozens of disparaging remarks to someone trying to share a smile
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:11
I have shown this to her and she is delighted and touched by all of nice things people have said and by their offers of btc, but she is with me in the belief that you guys should Hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:13:26
I don't believe I did
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:59:34
I like that you continue to ignore my refusal of those offers, but you're right, tots probably Illuminati
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:08:56
Thanks for the gold guys and gals, I hope it gave everyone a smile.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:29
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:30:45
Aren't the fees preset?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:11:30
Okay, we'll look up some videos and educate ourselves. Would you recommend something like etrade?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:03:06
I think that's more than a little extreme
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:00:52
Hopefully it will continue to grow
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:23:08
Wow! That's fantastic!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:25:36
I'll have to agree with you there
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:14:38
don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
Yes, I know it's the same copy and pasted reply to these, but I do mean it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:56:33
It wasn't even high end then, it was being given away on all sorts of contracts
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:20:34
I was hoping there would be auto cannibalism and you did not disappoint
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:05:29
I do, I care
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:26
We're grabbing onto the coat tails
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:52:23
I did the something similar when it first reached $1000
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:16
Idk, but I'm sure their wives are cool and interesting people
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:58:42
Millennia, we filter the copper for pennies out of the air like krill
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:45
Thank you for understanding, a lot of comments have been about how it's a terrible investment plan, fees, and fees for fees. When really I just wanted to share something that she did just to make me happy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:10:02
don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
Yes, I know it's the same copied and pasted reply to these, but I do mean it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:51:16
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:09:35
We do appreciate your offer
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:31:27
Hell, if we make even a 100 I'll call it a win
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:56
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:37
That's great to hear
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:09:15
Could you give me some information on where to go to properly educate myself on blue Chip stocks
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:48
I believe you missed the point, it's not about how much is in there, it's the fact that she did it
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:18:04
Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:48
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:18
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:22
I appreciate your input and the polite way that you phrased it. Again I just wanted to share my smile with others. I will check out personal finance, thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:54:36
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
Yes, I know it's the same copy and pasted reply to these, but I do mean it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:37:19
All we have to do is wait for the market to reach 300,000,000$ and we'll be set. But yeah, now that she has revealed her secret to me we're going to work together to keep investing small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:25:13
I don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:21:15
They aren't as high as you think
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:18
don't think I'll be doing that, you guys worked hard for your coins, save them. I appreciate the gesture though!
Yes, I know it's the same copy and pasted reply to these, but I do mean it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:48:34
I'm glad that could share a smile
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:19:40
What is a cryptokitty?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:37
What a twist!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:23
I have shown this to her and she is delighted and touched by all of nice things people have said and by their offers of btc, but she is with me in the belief that you guys should Hodl 
Don't worry, you guys are very much a part of our love story and we thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:01:45
I haven't heard of them, but with the power of them internetz I shall google
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:49:09
She said about a dollar each
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:29:03
Isn't half of the fun playing?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:04
If you're really that interested I can ask her when she gets home and try to respond with a satisfactory answer
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:13:18
You're fine, never apologize for trying to share knowledge. Thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:28
I grew up with the understanding that every penny has value, no matter how blemished
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:28:03
Quick tell her the price dropped and they're worthless again
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:43:41
I don't think that it was necessarily bad advice to tell you not to invest that much. Also, it's never too late to invest
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:39:00
Okay, I guess I'll look it up later
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:28:56
Thank you, my wife and I are going to investigate it today
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:36
$30.29 to be exact
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:49:51
We can't all be CCIE
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:33:45
Answered 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:46
All I want is for people to smile
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:35:37
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:44:36
Okay, thank you we will keep that in mind
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:48:17
I'm wifing her as hard as I can!
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:26:37
I do and work 10-12 hours a day 6-7 days a week. We work together to pay our bills. Just because someone is struggling financially, that doesn't mean that they aren't working or aren't working hard.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:33:30
Okay, I spoke to her. She invested $20 two weeks ago and this what it grew into, she invested 10$ more last night the hasn't shown up in the account yet. Her fee was $1 for each. I hope that answers your question
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:43:19
Thank you very much for that information, I'm going to research them now
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:30:50
Thank you very much
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:12:47
I believe she has done it twice. Medical bills are the issue, any extra money goes to paying them. She doesn't dictate my spending, so I don't know where you got that, we work together our marriage is a partnership
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:56:12
Okay, thank you for explaining
