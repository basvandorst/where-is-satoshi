We didn't steal it, we simply made it happen.

It was clean until it updated on April 20th.

Not sure why you bring up a double spend, I mentioned nothing about it.
And it *does* require a MITM (more or less) simply because if the unchanged transaction made it to the network first, there'd be no problem. Has to be something in between Gox and the bitcoin network intercepting and either changing, or rebroadcasting a duplicate transaction with a different hash, getting the dupe to the network first.
All I'm saying is the source of the corrupted hashes has to be on Gox's network stream, or somehow be able to read the packets Gox is sending and create and broadcast a dupe quickly enough so the bad hashed transaction gets included in the blockchain before the correct transaction.

I'm guessing a lot of financial types have encountered the story elsewhere, and in here is where I'd expect to find all of them.
Oh, and DAMMIT, I missed the minima, bought at 395, shoulda waited :-(

I'm cool with that, didn't know how widely known it was.

Dumb question time: If recently mined coins are not transferable, how did Gox get possession of them? 
Was someone mining to a Gox address?

Upvoting for the obscure reference!
Linking in case others don't know of it.

Hmm, not something I had thought of.

One guy almost got caught:
Another did:

He used their logo. That's a no-no, and it's probably the basis for their claim. And it isn't clearly a parody to me, I see nothing humorous.

It requires something of a MITM attack. Someone has to be one of the hops on Gox's path to other nodes, and is either actively altering the hash, or there's simply a bad router somewhere screwing up the packets sent from Gox. I've seen some NICs flip only certain bits under certain circumstances, and it's possible there's something in Gox's chain that's causing this just for them. Then again, it might be sabotage somewhere too.

Ahh, now I see why this sub bleeds out users. Not promoting doge, yet still seeing hate, and even happiness and people cheering on scammers.
So, my takeaway is that this sub is pro-scammer, from the comments I'm getting. So be it then. I'll be happy to cheer for Karpeles if that's how the wind is blowing.
My mistake for thinking a warning against a common enemy would be appreciated.
