You're talking about a SAR (suspicious activity report). The internal team do not have any time limits, only to act in a reasonable time. If they think you could be money laundering, they request'consent' from the NCA to proceed. 
The police are not obliged in any way. They decide based on normal police obligations whether they want to proceed.

What country are you talking about? If it's the UK I'm fairly sure your wrong. 
Happy to be disproved of you have this document you mention?

Futures on these platforms are a contract to buy (in this case) bitcoin at a predetermined date and price. 
So there may be a bitcoin future that expires on Jan 1st for say 11000 USD. If on Jan 1st bitcoin is worth more than 11000 then they get to buy the bitcoin cheap. If it's lower than that then lose money as they still have to buy at that price.
Often people won't actually take possession of the thing they have bet on, but rather just take the profit or suffer the loss.
Using futures you can bet on the price of bitcoin without ever actually owning any.
Edit: spelling

No. The link you attached specifically explains that the only time limits that exist are those that the NCA must work within. The only time limits on an internal team is to act promptly. 
Generally internal teams work as fast as they can. I know internal teams who will submit SARs on the same day they receive them. 
The 15 days you're talking about just isn't a thing.

Unfortunately, unless you just want to do it for fun, that budget will get you no where. Apologies! 
Try looking at newer coins, or instead try a multi pool. With a multi pool you will mine whatever is most profitable. However, your budget will not go far :(

A government can never go bankrupt in a currency they control. However, if a foreign governments request a debt be paid, for instance in USD, then they can collapse.

Do not use an exchange as a wallet. There's little else to say!

How is you calling anything in the crypto space a scam going to help anyone?

This makes no sense. Your coinbase account rebought bitcoin 5 times? Or you tried to buy once and it overbought? Or literally coinbase has withdrawn funds from your account... Without your CVC code?

This is a scam. Please see 
IF someone had figured out how to make 6% PER DAY, why would they share it with you?? 
They could take out a bank loan and make unlimited returns. The way this "company" is making this magical money is by...... stealing yours. 
Stay extremely far away from this or anything else even remotely similar.
