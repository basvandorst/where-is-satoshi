Decentralized 'cloud' computing is most certainly the future. I also see it as a natural response to the over-centralization of computing resources that we're experiencing today.
I'll be watching Storj, looks like a very interesting project.

I think this concept will, over time, have a very positive effect on the performance of the TOR network itself. Like Bitcoin mining, it should raise the general quality and performance of the network by giving an incentive for people to support it. (That is, you generate revenue by helping to operate the network). This should in turn give 'free' users more bandwidth for when the network is less utilized by those who require priority through payments.
However, I think the idea would best be executed by essentially having users bid for priority on the network. Essentially, the more coin that is associated with your traffic, the more it would be prioritized over others. When more people realize that they too can get a cut of this (by adding nodes to the network), the overall baseline performance of the network should  improve, as more high-speed nodes will be added. There are of course a number of things that make this rather difficult, but ultimately if this can be pulled off the results should be rather interesting.
Now, I don't believe this idea should be limited to TOR, and nor do I doubt that it will be. I've been thinking about an idea that's rather similar to this (but for other applications), and I think the concept of monetized distributed computing will have broader implications for the future of the internet as a whole, and hopefully usher in a divergence from the overly centralized nature of computing, storage, networking, and cloud computing in general.
