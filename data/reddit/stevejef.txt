It's possible but it would take 1.21 gigahashes, and here in 1985 you can't find that at your corner store.

Mike is a very smart guy. If he meant what he wrote here, then yes, Mike has become a different person.  But I'm not convinced this wasn't a designed leak.  Perhaps Mike has no intentions of pursuing this idea, but intentionally put out this fake memo for some twisted political game theory type move.  It would not surprise me to hear that Mike is floating this policy in public and privately contributing to Dark Wallet.  
Maybe Mike is a Dark Wallet shill.

Might want to learn about open source projects in general first.  Then read about the FBI's take down of Silk Road.  That should give you a feel for it.

A crime as judged by whom?  This entire discussion reeks of short sighted simple mindedness.
