You can argue that nobody knows if $10k is cheap or expensive.
@_date: 2019-07-20 14:22:16
So what do you actually use it for?
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:21:16
Totally organic
@_date: 2019-07-27 20:17:23
As the price goes up, the sell pressure from miners goes up, so you need an ever bigger flood of new money coming into the ecosystem to absorb miners' costs. Right now, with 1800 bitcoins minted daily, you need about $18m of new money coming in to buy those coins from miners. As long as electricity is priced in fiat, this seems like a big problem.

The tether printer is wide open..

I don't hate anything, I don't know why this needs to be emotionally charge. Having feelings about something is a terrible reason to invest or not.
I'm worried about what's about to happen to everyone on here.

How Wall Street prices these futures will tell everyone what Bitcoin is actually worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:34
Why can't you use dollars? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:46
Let go. Get out now. There's nothing wrong with buying video games with dollars.

Companies have revenue streams and pay dividends. If everyone sells Coca Cola there's still bottling plants, inventory, and SALES.

What do you think banks do? How do you take out a loan in Bitcoin without a bank?
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:56:05
One of a bank's primary functions is to offer credit.

A smart contract stops working when you don't pay or declare bankruptcy.

You can't give yourself a mortgage.
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:59:22
Who's going to lend you money without interest? If you think a bank is usurious, try Tony Montana and his baseball bat.
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:57:45
So coin base will become a bank that replaces other Banks?
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:59:57
They went from 4.05bn to 4.005bn on CMC.
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:46:37
Do you expect an honest answer in here?
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:55:44
Tether burned 50 million USDT.
@_date: 2019-02-09 00:23:01
What fundamentals let you make that statement? 
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:48:36
It's baffling that people here aren't more concerned with whatever the fuck is going on at Tether.
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:51:40
Why not use one of the innumerable other stores of value that aren't volatile? 
@_date: 2019-04-09 19:41:03
If you want to buy a house, you borrow currency from the bank. Whether that currency is dollars or Bitcoin, you still need a bank. The mantra of disrupting the banks makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:50:34
Volatility is the last thing you want when you're nearing or in retiement. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:57:24
It's really fucked up actually. Telling elderly people to invest in something that's really volatile is dumb, but telling them to invest in something *without telling them it's really volatile* is just evil. Don't pump Bitcoin by preying on the elderly
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:58:01
Also older people want low volatility assets that they can rely on. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:52:36
Which is somehow different than the money laundering and tax evasion that goes on in the crypto world? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:04:25
You should probably wonder how many are just people with legitimate concerns... 
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:02:17
What purpose is there to having a separate currency to pay for your coffee? What value would this add? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:05:01
Great answer, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:51:13
Why would regular consumers add the inconvenience of bitcoin into their daily routine? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:50:58
The number of people who just want to get rich vastly out numbers the people who actually want to use bitcoin for something. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:13:22
And that's something very wrong with the Bitcoin community. People want a currency of the future, but now that everyone's invested in Bitcoin nobody wants to talk about its problems, because that could lead to a new currency or a hard fork, and everyone would become bagholders. Instead of talking about problems, there's a toxic dismissive atmosphere towards any criticism. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:25:21
How can you say it's easier to pay with Bitcoin? I tap my credit card and it's approved in seconds, plus I get rewards and fraud protection. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:50:41
How much energy would Bitcoin use if it were actually adopted? 
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:25:28
When you borrow Bitcoins to buy a house and can't pay it back you're still going to lose your house. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:52:51
Why not just use a credit card? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:14:55
Not only that, but there's constant sell pressure from miners selling their coins, so Bitcoin needs new money to support the price. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:18:04
Is it? 
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:38:03
I mean all the signs point to it being a scam.
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:43:25
This is why it's hard to take Bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:55:14
'Crypto industry best practices' is a bit of an oxymoron isn't it? 
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:53:37
Why are criticisms so widely shunned in the crypto community? Most subreddits that focus on new technologies (i.e. fusion, self driving cars, etc.) are quite critical of the technology itself. In crypto, you get downvotes to oblivion if you try and talk about problems.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:12:25
How do forks factor into your reasoning? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:48:16
Shouldn't the burden of proof work the other way...like in any other investment? Given the ludicrous number of crypto scams why should tether be given a pass? 
'I have $2bn'
'Okay then show me' 
'erm no' 
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:19:24
Somebody is thinking the same about you.
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:32:22
What industry? The crypto industry?
