Lol, I hate you

Ugh, so inaccurate. Just saying, one of the top consulting firms in the world who has been actively developing war games with companies to develop stronger encryption and security through their advisory geoup. Just saying, they didnt partner with the audit or tax team, it also isnt a "partnership", it is a consulting contract to improve security...

My idea makes sense just as urs does.  I just feel like u guys are missing my point
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:31:09
hell yeah man, you're a gentleman and a scholar!
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:14:01
Yeah I guess it is very contradicting, if everyone holds onto them they have no value, but I don't want to use mine because I think they hold so much value
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:56:52
At first I was like, "shit I think I did something wrong"
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:23:42
I don't know how to verify I'm still all new to the bitcoin movement
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:42:06
I understand that, but as you break it down more and more you own such a small portion that it is irrelevant and worth nothing.  It is the same as cash, there is no gold backing bitcoin to give it value, unless I'm missing something it is a currency backed by nothing like the dollar.  I'm not saying  I don't have bitcoins, I'm just saying the theory is the same, but reverse
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:16:55
Yeah I get that, but say with bitcoin you start with 1 TB(to keep with your example) and eventually you can only get 1 gb or eventually even 1 byte.  1 bitcoin will be as difficult to obtain as 1 trillion dollars, that's what I'm trying to get to.  It is the polar opposite of money, we are starting in reverse.  I believe the system will work and be flawed just as the dollar, but in reverse, it's great for us, but eventually it turns into the same unbacked monetary system.  
It's just my take on it, I completely understand what you guys are saying, but in the long term, not just 5 years I believe my theory will be correct as well.  
Edit: Let me also say, I'm not the best at getting an idea out when it is fresh in my head
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:47:54
10/10 would transact again
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:11:48
When, I have more extra cash I will.  I wanted to buy a whole coin, but I'm going to wait till my next check
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:07:28
ok thanks, that makes alot of sense, I didn't realize it was difficult to move the coin, I thought that was the whole appeal.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:59:40
yeah, but if you say $100 is 1,000,000 .0001 cents, then .0001 becomes pointless imo, it becomes ehh the same.  The only difference between the concept of a bitcoin and a dollar is we are working in reverse.  That's why I'm getting a bitcoin or two and holding them things for my grandkids, just my 2 cents(no pun intended).
Edit: so continuing with this theory, it means getting in now is much more important than it would be to have a dollar 200 years ago, because a whole bitcoin will grow without having to invest it anywhere.  If you had a dollar and just put it under the bed it would be a dollar 200 years later, but with bitcoin, who knows what would happen if you left it under the bed for 200 years
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:10:22
Already did it!
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:58:34
I get the differences, but all I'm saying is in a reverse theory there is an elastic supply that is fixed(I understand that sounds dumb, but we are dealing with something no one has seen before), because to me when you are using .00000000000000000001 of a bitcoin  and it's worth $100 it is elastic, it becomes as devalued as a dollar
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:55:46
I know everyone is sensitive about this because it's so new, but I think you are missing my point.  The idea of continuously breaking it down is no different then continuously creating more they can both happen exponentially.  I think these discussions are great, especially so early on they foster learning and education about the currency.  I also think that none of us can be 100% right! it's just way to early on.  It's like attempting to predict the internets reach the day it was created.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:27:31
I mean I could have bought a coin, I just would been kind of bummed about losing $800 as most of us would be,  I'm ok to lose everything I put in.  Now it's just about enjoying the ride
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:36:59
I know, but it's hard to get the thought out.  But shit don't get me wrong. I got coin and I'm not letting it go.  If half the worlds wealth eventually goes to bitcoin, one coin will be worth 20m, I understand that won't happen but shit, just the thought is enough for me
Edit: don't bro me dude :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:41:12
That's my whole point it is the reverse of our system, but at the same time it is our system, one dollar is just a smaller piece of the pie then it used to be.  
And a very long time?  It's been 4 years and were already doing our first break down to the "mBTC", think about how long money has been around.  It will take far less for a bitcoin to become valued down (not devalued), because if this catches on it has the potential to become a global currency which would require much more supply. 
I just don't see why on earth people would spend bitcoins if they believe in them.  That's why you have dollars to spend, I'm not saying bitcoins should not be used as a currency, but if they are going to be a currency a one bitcoin will be so damn valuable if there are only 21M, I think this is already being proved by the huge price spikes
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:24:00
that would be easy to move!  they are so small
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:12:39
by fiat do you mean like 30k in usd
Edit: serious question
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:57:26
It's the thought of free money, when people hear they can mine bitcoins they assume it's easy and a quick pay.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:32:18
This will probably get downvoted, and it's difficult to articulate the idea, but here's my thoughts on the move from BTC to mBTC
My only question is if we do this, doesn't it essentially destroy the system of bitcoin and turn it right back into a printing of money system.  Since we were only ever meant to have 21 million.  
I understand that it is just a different way to have a determination of the coin, instead of .001, but it just becomes to me the same as paper printable money.  When $10/mBTC becomes worth $1,000/mBTC and you break it down again, it just becomes as pointless and as endless as printing money. Kind of, I understand there is still a finite amount, but it seems to become infinite when you look at it like that.  
It's essentially the exact reverse of our money system, instead of making a penny become worth less (in usd), by printing more, the penny (or in this case mBTC) is worth more, but they can both occur in an unlimited amount, defeating the purpose of having a finite amount.
