@_date: 2017-12-08 20:44:04
Maybe he's bullshitting? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:42:03
Btc is kinda scary. Idk y but it's just something about it that I'm sketched out about. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:49:30
Sending $10 and getting forced to pay a $35 fee.... Wtf. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:36:58
So I'll have to pay a fee of $9.87 all in total to transfer my btc to my bitpay? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:42:20
Not recently lol :) 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:43:23
Any1 else uses this website to? I just resent used it and I'm only at 0.00000200 btc lol .
I keep gambling it to much. You can also mine btc in this website. You'll need a strong computer tho. For gambling, it's a hi or lo game. And if any1 here used this website, do you know if we can transfer our btc from
this website to my current wallet that I'm currently using?? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:09:24
Pretend if I wanted to buy a bitpay card, and wanted to put my btc in my bitpay card, but the wallet I use to hold my btc isn't from bitpay.com. Can I still transfer the btc to my bitpay debit card? Or would I need to transfer my btc from my current wallet to the bitpay wallet? 
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:10:14
If u want lol. It might go up again tho. So u can wait if U want. It's all up to u. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:26:56

@_date: 2018-03-10 05:43:55
Btc won't go to $19k again anytime soon. Look how far it crashed lol. It even went as low as $6k. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:37:46
True, but it'll still be hard for thieves to get access of his card because they still gotta know the 3 number on the back of the card.
