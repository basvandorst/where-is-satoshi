Comparing an inappropriate patch to raping and murdering someone's wife?

He's since seen sense and the flag is no longer default in the bitcoin overlay. Mainline portage should also get the change within a few days.

Do you have a link to browse the overlay in question? I've been trying to dig it out to no avail as I'm unsure whether he's actually disabled it as a default or simply included a warning message due to his ambiguous wording.
EDIT: [found it]( - he has indeed made good and it is no longer a default.

I'll give you a good Keynes quote:


Even thinking of "doubling down" is insane. Bitcoin is not the only tradable item that you could use to (attempt to) make back what you've lost.
If you don't need the funds, keep whatever BTC you've got, but learn when to leave well enough alone. Whatever you think you're doing, you're really just rolling the dice, if you weren't, you wouldn't be here in this situation because your "system" would work and you wouldn't have losses in excess of your wins.

But you're not really.
He enabled an inappropriate patch by default, he has since remedied that and issued an apology of his own volition. He could have done one, the other or neither. He already had a member of the Gentoo council backing him up.
By contrast, If you rape and murder someone's wife, whilst you can obviously apologise, you can't actually undo it.
I would say that accepting his apology under these circumstances is entirely reasonable and even if not, using the rape and murder of someone's wife as a parallel does little more than make your sense of perspective seem highly questionable.
