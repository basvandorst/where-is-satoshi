My CU banned all cryptocurrency transactions.  RBFCU

They told me over the phone.  Due to regulatory reasons.

Yes.   Mainly Coinbase.

I have a CU that would cancel my debit transactions, then I switched to bank drafts and never had problem. Might be option for OP.

So I found a way around it for now.  I setup my PayPal debit card on coinbase and it pulls directly from my bank when I buy.

I have been through 3 banks and this has, by far, been the best one.  I don't have a clue who to try next.

This seems like a really big deal to me.  It is my money and I should be able to give it to whoever I want whether it be Coinbase or a Nigerian Prince.

Yes, US.  RBFCU.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:59:29
That's right.

Hmm, I wonder if it would be a good idea to run a node on my Google fiber connection?

My CU banned all cryptocurrency transactions.  I got around it by linking my PayPal, which is linked to my CU, to deposit money into Coinbase.  The limits went up to $750 a week instead of $100.  It is good to know I can cash out directly to them too.
