@_date: 2018-01-11 23:02:16
time to order a chicken
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:54:06
you can do that thing  and sell it to the people who want to run a node
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:13:06
Isn't that a LN node in the testnet?? Or could the features be changed to run the node in the mainet?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:57:36
Can someone link a guide about how to install  a lightning node ???
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:29:30
Yes! You just have to solve the problems and sell it like customized node. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:05:07
How does it work currently? when is  the transaccion  sent to the blockchain? do you have to put some btc in a shared channel??
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:12
I don't believe you!! Omg!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:46
Hahaha now buy again!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:40:32
The feelings!!!...
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:40:34
When the lightning??
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:29
when will it be ready to download in the appstore?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:53
with the total adoption of segwit the LN, schnorr signatures and the block increase in the future ... would you find some decentralized currency more efficient and with less fees than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:49:46
Bitcoin will be dead if it continues this way ...we need user friendly apps that make transactions easy to send ..nobody will use the LN if they have to do a search to figure out how it works
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:22:22
Tell me when it's ready
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:36:06
Tonight it was about 14k
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:19
They are very impatient...the block size will be increased without any doubt in the coming years
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:24:24
I'm not a programmer so.... Please ......
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:37:00
thank you for  the information...I didn't know Bitfinex had deployed segwit  . I'm also canceling my account with coinbase but they do not allow me to download the history...they say my account is not complete.
Could someone help me?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:57:53
THE GOOD OLD DAYS!! AHHHH...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:12:35

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:11
Yesss !!!!amen!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:38:13
We need criticism for improve

@_date: 2017-12-24 18:59:56
wich exchanges will be available???
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:49:03
I really don't care about other centralized and more efficient currencies...I have a libertarian point of view in this whole matter ... and I believe in a community capable of establishing an economic system without the influence of governments.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:26:50
me neither , she is a fucking loser
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:25
Time to sell all my bch!!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:01:21
It's interesting how many people prefer to buy altcoin rather than bitcoin because the high price.... I think this proposal makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:11
Just sell it for the real bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:39:16
This is 6 months old
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:01
I do not fully understand the transaction process ... it is assumed that all bitcoin transactions or at least the final balance between two channels will be done through the blockchain ... is that so?
to make transactions with a web page ... would you need an intermediary channel? Or would each site have its own node?
I see blockstream supporting a global network of payments through lightning ... would it be blockstream the intermediary in the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:40:03
It's interesting how turkey is positioned about bitcoin .... 
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:53:15
thank you, there is not much information about this and it always helps to talk with someone with more knowledge about the subject. .. you know ??  fake gold is everywhere....
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:14:44
Thank you too , I'll buy first a 1/4 oz to make sure is real gold what they sell, and then... who knows!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:12
Me too
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:05:40
it's going to be great!!! I would like to invest in this
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:54:34
waiting to 800  to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:52:12
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:01:37
it's a complement... a little bit difficult to understand ....
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:23:09
Who 's the boss? Yeeessss
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:47:52
I think we should implement schnorr first. The lightning network can wait a little bit . This is too exciting! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:55:55
yes --- it is better to get out... the taxes are too high!!
if you look security it would be better to buy a trezor or a ledger and keep your bitcoins safe , but if you want to trade go to bitfinex or kraken and make an account.
Personaly.... i have my bitcoin on bitfinex and I haven´t had any problem yet...the only thing that bothers me is that bitfinex does not allow trade with euros 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:36:24
you have several options .. if you want lower fees you can choose btc  wait for the lightning network to develop and use it only if you want....you would also have the option to use the btc blockchain directly.
Also you have bch,a coin  which the main miners are Chinese and have lunch together every day ( with lower fees in the future)
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:08:00
let them buy bitcoins in a centralized system they will regret
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:55:02
It simplifies the size of the transaction
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:21:43
congratulations to everyone!!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:07:09
What application is that?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:37:17
