Getting banned is he least of ur worries, thats forgery and in europe you can go to jail for a long time for that

Yea thats why i bought 10k usd of btc today...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:15:11
i put in 10k at 19320 tried to sell at 19600 but kraken bailed on me so i sold with a loss at 18700 because i knew it wouldnt go higher, i then bought BCH with that money and made like 100% when it hit 4k.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:23:16
why would it crash?
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:24:59
You could literally say the same thing for any tangible/intangible asset...
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:39:53
bitcoin is not an investment its a peer to peer currency
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:17
ah ok that explains it then
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:25:35
lightning network wont solve the 1mb block issue dude, theres 8 billion people in this world not everyone will use lightning network.

how is he stealing someones money, does he own bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:08:30
or your could you know, just check his real twitter account
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:06:02
The point is when you describe something you call it by its primary purpose/function. I dont call my car an investment, its a car, when people ask me why i bought it i will tell them as an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:55
there is 200 000+ unconfirmed transactions on bitcoin how did you get yours through?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:37:11
thats not the definition of paypal, sorry...
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:55:37
And once again you can say that for any asset, your argument is kind of frail.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:25:24
The only way it will crash is if no one buys when they sell list it.
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:50:44
And people also sometimes lose their shit or don't remember their passwords
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:14:02
Exactly i will never grasp the idea why someone would put money into a bank when there are far better options available aside from cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:42:42
Why just bitcoin and not the other alt coins, do they feel intimidated?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:09:00
this is why i didnt sell BCH, a market of 1 billion+ people is bound to be worth something one day
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:02:23
Spread it out to multiple exchanges preferably ones that arent solely in cryptocurrencies but also do futures stocks options commodities, so if they do get hacked they still have the liquidity to reimburse you.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:36:13
thats the point of a mortgage dude, bank doesnt care what you do with your money because its secured by the mortgage....

Several south european countries are considering using cryptocurrencies as defacto
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:47:21
I dont think there is any exchange that has the capacity to sell 1 billion let alone 100 billion $ worth of bitcoin. Only option would be to source it from the miners directly but even then 1 billion dollars is 3 million coins.

It has a lot to do, once fiat currencies are replaced with cryptocurrencies  there is no need to print new money anymore. It should actually cause deflation.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:42:41
Lots of companies involved in crypto there. Wouldnt be surprised if they are  in the world per capita

there was a "Poll expert" college professor during the elections on CNN who said that Trump has no chance of winning and that he will eat a cockroach on live TV if he gets more than 240 electorals. Surprisingly he held up to his promise.

*Fraud: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.*
it would be if JP morgan was actually buying it for themselves, wrongful deception = calling bitcoin "fraud", financial or personal gain = buying the dip because of deceiving the public. But in the end it looks like its just brokerage on the behalf of their clients.

Now look at it from another point, you want to transfer money to a bank account half way across the globe, bank transfer will take you 2 days minimum. those 30 minutes then account for nothing

I agree with you, like usually when im in a hurry to find out something at work the first thing i do is google it, creating a forum/reddit post and getting a reasonable answer may take ages depending on the topic in context.  Now this is where i go back to the OP, wouldnt he like to know the answer of his question faster and move on in life?
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:56:49
Thats even worse, that would indicate corruption and probably even bribery
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:23:32
perfect example of fraud...

Spending btc increases the price not vice versa
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:57:29
How do you know they do that, almost everyone knows that bitcoin price will go up, why would amazon sell bitcoin for dollar when it would actually make them lose money
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:59:08

On the basis of what would they ban it, it would inflict major riots around the country.
