Isn't Shor's Algorithm for RSA not AES?
Unless something new has been discovered, quantum computing can at best half the bits for AES. For example, AES-256 using a quantum computer would take as long as a normal computer would take to decrypt AES-128.
And unless I'm wrong AES-256 is what bitcoin currently uses, and AES-128 is commonly used today and is plenty secure.

Creepy. The name of the project is LOTR related.

I'd like to build a miniPC media center for the TV.
Does anyone know of a name for this type of hobbyist activity? There is a subreddit for just about anything, but I don't know what it is called. Any help would be fantastic!
I want something that can play 99% of all videos (without re-encoding) that can be downloaded from the net. mplayer on debian probably, or vlc. I've got a 1080p 3D tv so 10-30GB movies between 10-40mbps h264.

But what did you buy at?
I bought @ 101 and sold ≈8% @ 130.
I'm kind of regretting still holding, but such is life.

I clicked on 60 Day and saw a weak head and shoulders pattern. I didn't realize it was historic btc data and almost sold.
Thank you for scaring the shit out of me.

Wow awesome!
This really should be upvoted more. A professional btc exchanger!

It is not entirely a user end problem. Maybe it is today, but it wasn't then:
Back in around '03 I had an osx edu botnet. At the time OSX defaulted to open vnc without a password if no screen sharing settings were checked. This meant any computer not behind a firewall on OSX was essentially mine.
Back in '02 before XP took off there was a netbios bug/backdoor in all non-NT versions of windows up to '98. If the computer wasn't behind a firewall and file sharing settings were OS default, I had full access to C. At the time it was a little under one fourth the computers on the net.
Sometimes it is easier than it looks.

Bitcoin lacks instant gratification.
It takes too long to transfer money from one person to another.
Even if it speeds up in the future, it will still take time.
@_date: 2013-05-16 00:56:43
I'll take that bet.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:56:55
You walk into a store. You want to buy some stuff with bitcoins. Do you wait around 20+ minutes for it to transfer?
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:44:02
Maybe the news story is fake?
You'd think we would hear something by now.

A quick look at my algorithm from two weeks ago shows a high between 189 and 234.
However, if the dust really has settled "the spike" is a misnomer. It could take 6 months to 2x for all we know. Also, a reversal is possible (low probability) AFTER the price moves upward.

Very cool!
It will be interesting to see the correlation of btc to outside markets like $spx over time as btc becomes more mainstream. However, I doubt I ever would use that data to decide a trade.
Good luck with everything! (Not that you need it.)
