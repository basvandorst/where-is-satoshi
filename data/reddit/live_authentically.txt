I'm surprised there were so many shorts, to be honest.  The price had dropped 4k in 7 days.   That's unsustainable.
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:17:12
I think we are going to chop in the 9000-9999 range for a long time and slowly grind up as the moving averages reset after that parabolic run.  Super healthy in my opinion.  Now that the libra hype is over with, it should be nice and quiet for a few weeks.
Good time to accumulate if you feel you don't have enough btc.

My Co worker was selling his 7500 bitcoin he mined for a school project in cryptography using his pc when it first hit $100. 
Yeah he was one of those guys.  I started buying several years later.  Still mad at myself for not buying them from him.

Alts are dying on the vine because they have no market, not because of shit talking and bad karma.  The smart money coming into Bitcoin is not interested in altcoins.  If/when Bitcoin hits it's ATH, I'm sure we will see a resurgence of retail investors again, I have no doubt we'll at some point see another speculative altcoin season with those still left standing.  A repeat of 2017 isn't happening again, but there are legit projects out there with potential that may catch on someday (Ethereum for example).
The market clearly overreached and there was unfounded optimism that crypto would penetrate all financial markets overnight.  Turns out we're still a long ways off from that.  Bitcoin is the only viable use case given the current state of technology today (Store of Value, digital gold).
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:26:15
This is so damn bullish it's not even funny.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:17:51
I'm the same way.  I was very close to buying a VRRY expensive car, but bought more btc instead.  :)

@_date: 2019-07-06 05:22:02
Exactly, I bought a lot at 3900 but that was risky as fuck despite the outcome. I am very much aware of the fact that at the time I made a really stupid financial decision.
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:44:14
I think we consolidate in the 10-12k region for quite a while, maybe a month.  Whether we break to the upside or not after is anyone's guess.  With the shakeout over and the clear and violent bounce at 9.6k, it's not looking like the hopes and dreams of scooping up cheap bitcoin will materialize.  Everyone is looking for 7-9k BTC, which means it probably won't happen.
At the end of the day, I think it comes down to global monetary policy and trade.  Bitcoin has a ways to go before it hits retail.  I'm looking at macro factors at this point.
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:55:34
Shit is going down real soon.  Bad news stocks go up, good mews, they go down.  This fuckery is only just the beginning.
Very exciting times for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:27:33
Congrats.  This is the hardest thing to do in crypto and is absolutely necessary for success.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:56:41
Damn straight.  I know it's hard to do but the key is to stay calm regardless of the price, otherwise HODLing will become unbearable.  Shakeouts are normal and will happen repeatedly.  
Mastering this struggle is the only way to win this game.  The higher the price, the harder it gets.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:22:10
This is all fine and good if you don't care about timing.  7 days is a long time in crypto.  Sometimes it works in your favour, sometimes it's catastrophic.  Imagine you deposited 10k on June 19th @ 9k when the market looked juiced for a run rather than buying immediately.  By the time the funds became available, the price is at the yearly high only a week later at 13800.  So assuming you get the immediate strike price around 9200 (premium added) and buy 1.08btc, you instead end up with .72 btc and then 24 hours later, you are down to $7500 when the dump occurs.  If you had bought instantly, you'd have $11500 ish after the dump.  Depositing to CB Pro after the dump would be much better.
I use this example because I did heavy buying during that period.  Very happy I ate the fees and the correction didn't put me underwater.  I think it's always best to make an informed decision first.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:39:47
I think it was the Fed chairman pouring cold water on Libra (and in turn the Crypto space) that did it, but nobody really knows for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:39:56
I actually think BTC won't take much market share from gold, it will just replace gold's function for the younger generations as a store of value. I doubt boomers and existing gold bugs will ever change their views on gold.  Perhaps they will buy some but I don't see a mass shift from gold to btc.  It's likely they will coexist for a long time to come and gradually move over to btc as the digitally native population ages.
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:08:59
Shakeouts are tough for people, I admit it was not something I handled well the last bull run.  It's something you have to adapt to as a bitcoin hodler.
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:51:06
Gee, I wonder why they want a rate cut?
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:00:36

The only YouTuber I trust in the space is Krown's Crypto Cave.  He's quite good and genuine in his analysis and openly shows his trades in full.  Also he's hilarious. 
Most of the other guys are just shilling stupid trading courses to newbies to go get rekt on bitmex.  Crpyo Kirby is one of the biggest con artists out there.  The guy magically catches every dump and pump... Yeah right.
If they don't show their trades, censor stuff out and force you to buy their scammy member access, move on.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:22:15
So that's why my bitcoin portfolio just bumped by 15%.  Go get em congress!
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:43:20
I'm not going to even think about selling until the central banks begin increasing rates again and the next recession has triggered a new bottom in equities, so probably never.
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:28:53
I agree. It's a good story.  Wealth is usually earned, even when it comes to HODLing bitcoin.  Some got lucky, but those days are gone now. Nobody forgets they had bitcoin in years past anymore. 
HODLing is the job now.  It's not easy keeping your stack.
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:26:41

Easy money my ass.
@_date: 2019-08-24 00:16:37
Holding bitcoin is one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.  To be able to endure this market when serious money is on the table deserves respect. 
If I become ridiculously wealthy, I will have earned every penny.  I have the ulcers to prove it.

Guess not all bitcoiners have good taste in cars.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:27:06
Nope, but I am certain I can handle what is coming in either direction.  That's the only way to not get shaken out.
@_date: 2016-11-06 04:39:42
FWIW. here's my opinion as to why they went up 20%:
Overstock announced the launch of T0 about a week ago (the first blockchain stock exchange) for which all of their shareholders would be offered limited preferred stock if they buy before the deadline of November 7th.  As this deadline is looming, people are getting their money in to take advantage.
It has nothing to do with Overstock's earnings or how much product they move compared to amazon, IMHO.
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:07:28
Not that my opinion matters a whole lot, but I don't believe we will see a major correction (30-40%) until we hit the all time high.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:26:36
Yep, it's totally natural to feel the pain.  A lot of people got wiped out in the last couple of weeks.  Many of us have made it through the bad times with crypto.  The only way to succeed is to learn how to manage the emotional swings.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:06:02
If they haven't bought by now they are FOMOing like the rest of them in my book.  But hey whatever im happy either way.
Just want folks to be careful.  Contrary to popular belief, bitcoin bull markets are harder to deal with than bear markets in my opinion.  In a bear market after the initial shock, all you gotta do is play video games, find a hobby or something and forget about it for a year.  Bull markets are all consuming and can easily lead to greed or fear induced stupid decisions.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:09:42
Let's see how long it takes for this dip to be bought up.  Looks like the bleeding has stopped, for now.  Happily HOLDing.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:12:03
Gonna take a few tries to pop 10k.  That resistance is immense.  I wouldn't hold your breath for a break to 5 digits tonight.

Not getting excited until we pass 12.5.  We need a good showing from China in the next couple of hours.  There's still a good case for bears here.  That said, it really doesn't matter what the price is.  I'm here for the BTC, not more fiat.

@_date: 2019-06-26 06:44:48
That's some heavy duty FOMO you got going on.  I strongly suggest you take your time, learn the ropes, carefully evaluate your risk profile and buy wheiyou are ready.
This market will change you.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:17:04
I said I'm curious what will happen.  Helps to think ahead, does it not?
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:53:21
Alright folks, be careful out there.  We're entering into the FOMO stage and things are about to get crazy.  Watch your bitcoin, do NOT get greedy and just enjoy the ride.  
Protect your investment, go get a hardware wallet.  Don't margin trade and don't day trade.
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:33:39
Yep, today is one of those days I am happy to be 90% BTC with LTC and ETH making up the rest.  I'm curious now that there's a void in the US for shitcoin availability, what will happen to the Alts available on Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:04:41
I stopped buying at 9k and I am fully allocated for this bull run now.  I am keeping some cash aside for corrections, but that's about it.  Will probably take some money off the table at 20k to cover most of my initial investment and then go from there.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:14:00
This sell-off has been bullish as fuck in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:31:10
The final resistance broke.  It's clear skies to 17k now.    This is rolling through region by region.  Probably will take a breather once the euros finish buying.
@_date: 2019-06-14 19:12:04
I agree with you.  This was truly an interesting day in the crypto marketplace.  Although there was from my view no new cash flow, there was a large scale Altcoin selloff today into bitcoin, probably due to the Binance news.  The only non stablecoin that hadn't dropped was Bitcoin SV, and that tells me everything I need to know.  
Now that this event has occurred, I'm curious what will happen to the price over this weekend.  Clearly, there's a lot of crypto on the move right now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:47:39
They all failed to realize that nobody gives a rats ass about transaction fees and it turns out the ability to move millions of dollars safely across borders with adequate liquidity was more important for a store of value.  I'll use whatever stable coin years from now to buy a hamburger, thanks. 
What a shocker.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:56:16

@_date: 2019-06-26 03:40:29
Hey that's OK, glad it worked out.  I took on a massive loan to substantially increase my position, so I too made an unwise decision.  Sometime when you know, you know.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:11:55
Yes, it's certainly hard at first, which is why I strongly believe it's an imperative to survive at least 1 bull and 1 bear market before you have the stones to hold for the long term.  It only gets harder the higher the price goes.  This is coming from someone that bought what would now be considered a fortune at $600 BTC and then lost/sold most of it for minimum profit.
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:16:15
Absolute carnage this week for the margin traders and weak hands.  Will they ever learn? Nobody is robbing my btc, not this time.

@_date: 2019-06-26 00:59:28
None of you bought at the bottom because that's when sentiment was at the lowest point.  You had to be a true believer with balls of steel to buy at 3200-3500.

Clearly, some consolidation time is needed.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:58:15
We will see who are the true hodlers out there when the cycle peaks.  We are only getting started.  It is going to get exponentially harder to hodl in the coming years.  We will see who can hack it.   Bitcoin is 100x harder to handle in a bull market than a hear market.
@_date: 2019-06-18 03:54:30
This.  If you want to get btc instantly and then move it to your hardware wallet, I haven't found anything better.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:20:15
Not my first bull market.  :)
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:32:29
Couldn't agree more.  Soon we'll know where all the battle lines are:
\-Central Banks (Fiat)
\-Banks (JPMorgan Coin)
\-Tech (Libra)
All we need now is an amazon coin, who knew WW3 would be in fintech?!
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:58:54
You're welcome.  After the last bull market I feel it's super important to pass along the wisdom I've gained.   The higher this thing goes, the harder it is to stay disciplined so always remember your plan.  It's one thing to lose or gain 100 bucks on a move, it's another entirely when it's 10s of thousands.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:40:43
Custodial services and regulation are coming.  I don't think this is a major hurdle in the long run.   I would imagine similar arguments were made when bills are introduced in place of gold.  Imagine trying to conceptualize a piece of paper as money that can be ripped, burned, copied, easily stolen (paper is light) and defaced as a replacement for the precious metal.  Hell, people still aren't over it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:05:30
These bears keep feeding the whales like pigs to slaughter.  This is how you lose your bitcoin.  Never margin trade, especially in a bitcoin bull market unless you are a savage and are a career trader. 
So dumb.

You lost 10% of your stack.  I have one piece of advice for you, do not try to recover it by trading.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:33:00
Based on your reaction to this price action, each and every one of us should ask and answer this one simple question:
Are you a weak hand or a strong hand?
If this dump made you panic, it's time to re-evaluate your position size.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:24:54
Price is still in recovery.  Fomo will come soon afterward.
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:03:55
I bought at 700, I've bought at 1000 I've bought at 14000, I've bought at 6500, I've bought at 3900 and I've bought at 5000 and most recently bought at 9k.  Last two years, more or less my routine. 
I'm fucking ready.
@_date: 2019-06-18 05:39:22
I'd be shocked if we hit 25k before 2020.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:15:04


Welcome to the show.  This is going to happen many times during the bull run.  If you cannot absorb a 20-40% hit, that's a clear sign that you are over-allocated.
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:58:34
Every time you hear Schiff say gold, train yourself to hear bitcoin instead, then his talks are worthwhile to listen to.  His overall assessment of the state of the economy is decent.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:12:27
You are correct, most of the big big whales out there will never sell.  Bitcoin will probably always be hoarded and the higher the price gets, the less appealing it is to exchange for dollars.  The price is only exciting because it gives you a frame of reference for what your buying power is in the current economy relative to your bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:29:12
I get the feeling that a mid-2020 launch is HIGHLY ambitious.
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:29:34
Pullbacks will happen, but I don't see it happening for a while.  I believe we need to reach the all time high first before we see genuine price discovery .  Retail investors haven't even come in yet.  This recovery is still very early and the price run up has been due to the lack of liquidity.  The otc market has dried up so the only way to buy btc at large scale without massive slippage is to squeeze the shorts. 
It's been the same pattern since 4k...slow and steady rise on low volume, TA starts to show bearish, shorts pile up and then a big buy order happens and they get squeezed.  The price consolidates then they repeat over and over again.
People are getting hosed and I have mixed feelings about it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:23:25
As far as I'm concerned we are still in the recovery phase.  I don't think we see wide adoption at the retail level until inflation hits main street.
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:35:22
If you are confident your phone is locked down, sure.  Otherwise, it's probably best to use a hardware wallet.  Mycelium is best served as a day to day wallet in my opinion.

@_date: 2019-06-26 05:36:06
It's cause you FOMOd, don't feel bad though, it happens to the best of us.  Never buy into a rally, it usually doesn't work out, best is to buy dips in a bull market or buy on consolidation.
@_date: 2019-06-18 03:59:57
Have you survived a bear market yet!?
If no, 5% max. 
Have you survived a bull market yet? (resisted margin trading, shit coins, etc)
If no, 5% max
If you answered yes to those two questions and you are still here, then consider going all in.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:52:23
I meant the top of the rally.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:42:38
Yeah, you might as well light money on fire.  People like to gamble, and there are no higher stakes than trading this market.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:31:48
Saving money and investing in your future is always an achievement.  If BTC gains mass global adoption, you'll feel pretty good about owning .1 BTC.  If it doesn't, you invested a statistically insignificant amount.  Everyone should hold a reasonable position in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:27:23
Nope.  There's no way you would catch that with any sort of consistency.  Get out of that mindset immediately otherwise you will lose your bitcoin stack. Guaranteed.   
Then the next bear market hits and you are rekt.  Nobody can time this market, even pros.
Get rid of the calculator.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:52:37
Just stay calm.  Don't lose your cool if you drop 10-20%.  This is normal for bitcoin.  You bought the top of a rally so you may see some losses for a while.  If you are scared, you should carefully consider what your risk tolerance is.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:28:44

I have the Nano Ledger X and it's been a fantastic.  The build quality is top notch and the Ledger Live app is pretty handy.   I like that I can use it on my phone and my PC.  The only complaint I have with it is the portfolio app leaves much to be desired in some areas.  Prices don't update correctly and it lacks general refinement.  It'll get there in time though, the bones are good.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:03:44
I'm no left winger, but you do the crime, you do the time.  No sense whining about it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 05:35:01
This is why HODLing is the only way.  Longs and shorts continue to get liquidated in this consolidation period. 
Be content with your stack size and do not gamble to increase it.
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:16:09
I'm starting to get the feeling that Ethereum probably won't become the platform of choice for the enterprise when all is said and done.  I seriously doubt that Ethereum can scale in that setting.  I see VMware dominating that market more than anyone else.  You need a block chain that can integrate into  ESX that can deploy nodes by the billions to any It infrastructure class (on Prem, cloud, etc) in a managed and secure way. 
Permissioned proof of stake smart contracts need serious enterprise grade solutions here.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:33:28
It most definitely is not.  ETH or whatever similar smart contracts system wins out is the key to blockchain in the enterprise.  There are more applications than just money.
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:38:12
I think fear is very high for the 1%, they see the PE ratios at all-time highs, interest rates going down and corporate debt skyrocketing.  They know the gravy train is coming to an end.  However, it would appear the general public is largely oblivious because inflation is virtually non-existent and employment is at all-time highs.
This bifurcated sentiment is confusing markets, but I think it will break eventually because the public can only take on so much debt without wages and inflation rising significantly.  There's just no upside left in the markets, QE will only overvalue them further, which will only increase fear and pump the debt bubble even further.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:36:22
This is how you turn from noob to hodler.  Many of us went through this in '17.
@_date: 2019-09-03 05:42:38
There's a decent chance that it will.  The consolidation period looks like it's coming to an end in a week or two and there's a lot of tailwinds for bitcoin right now. 
Brexit, Baakt, Trade war, Argentina, Interest rate cuts, ecb stimulus, and so on.
The pump today was a pretty big deal.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:21:50
I agree.  Something about this dump was the epitome of fuckery.  Glad I don't trade this shit show.
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:25:22
I believe it's because most people are holding and not using it to purchase consumer goods.  When transferring large sums, it makes no sense to use Segwit.  If I'm able to accept a $3 fee to withdraw a hundred bucks at an ATM, I sure as hell am OK paying $5 to move thousands safely within a reasonable amount of time on chain.  
Lightning network needs to be there, but adoption of bitcoin doesn't require it yet.  That's a good thing, it needs to build long term trust.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:47:28
Nobody knows for sure, but I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin will likely benefit from the government's inevitable loose fiscal policy to fight a recession, but it's not clear what will happen to bitcoin when there is a recession.   You can argue there will be a lot of bitcoin buying due to QE and lower interest rates, but you can also argue there will be a lot of selling to cover losses.
Maybe Bitcoin will neither benefit or gain from a recession.  Bitcoin will still be worth a bitcoin after all.

We are at the depression phase.  The anger phase was the drop from 6k last month.

Absolute debacle out there today.  The only way to win this game is not to play.  Whales are completely wrecking margin traders, time and time again.  
Charts are saying only one thing.  hodl.

Yep, what was unique about this one is that both the longs and the shorts got wrecked on both sides.  I bet pretty much everyone got stopped out.  Absolutely amazing to watch.

Ah, they all will learn eventually.  There's only 1 play in a bull market, you hodl.  The ONLY way to get rich in crypto is to learn this lesson.  Often the hard way.  The Bear markets are the easiest to deal with.  All you gotta do is dollar cost average in and go play video games for a year.  Bull markets are the real challenge.

Be careful folks.  Bull markets are even harder to manage than bear markets.  Put away the calculators and wait.  Sad my accumulation days are winding down, now the hard waiting really begins.

Nah it's his business, of course he's got a gold only agenda publicly.  Just accept it, the man wants to stay in business. 
His financial ideology is what really matters anyway.  You could take any of his speeches and dub the word bitcoin, we would all be on the same page.  He's no dummy, he's got a tonne of bitcoin.

I'm losing faith in the retrace narrative.  That major dump and recovery really sealed the deal for me.  We have ways more to go before a retracement.
Not that I would mind though.  My accumulation days remaining are soon coming to an end.
