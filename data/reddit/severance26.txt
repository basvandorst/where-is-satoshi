Can anyone confirm if USD trading is blocked or if it's just withdrawals? I imagine they can park in USD on the exchange....

Misleading title. This is about giving your btc to charity

This is not correct. The sub-1btc trades are HFTs. The web server was likely overloaded from volume of orders. Things also got quite sloppy the algo side, too many new players getting in last second before next Mondays festivities.

Thanks for confirmation :) WHat do you trade? CAD? In which case... I can't see those charts either :P

I guess that means I was correct. I'd actually go so far as to narrow it down to actual hourly wages of 2700yen/hr because that seems to be what Japan has decided is a good wage for monkeys. I recommend you get a legitimate PhD (ie not online) or get out of English teaching. It took me all of sixteen months to get a better paying job after quitting, the whole thing is a racket to keep foreigners in their place.
On the other hand, if you are still in your 20's and very single, some people would argue that you should HODL and fuck as many coeds as you can. If you are halfway decent looking then you should be swimming in pussy. Even if you are not swimming in it, at least they'll think your dick looks big.

Yeah the way they deal with gox may sink them.

Also some algo strats involve testing markets with trivial trades to see the reaction. A big, actual trade would be a position giveaway, these smaller ones can be used to determine the seriousness of a wall, or force another trader/bots hand.

Oh do tell. Where do you teach English? I should have said salary instead of per hour because I didn't mean per lesson.... 42 man/mo before bonus

Im only half trolling. The university lecturers I know don't make more than 3000/hr.  So that's 230 hours or so. How close am I

Hmmm I hadn't thought of this at all. It is actually quite problematic. They should open the futures market to 24/7.
