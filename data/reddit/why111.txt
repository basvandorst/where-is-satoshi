I think most people on support LN. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:23:46
That's exactly how it should be. I think this change is on affecting the default number of transactions and any miner could choose to let 0 transactions in a block. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:58:33
If you don't accept .06 fee transactions then the miner who mines the next block will. Simple game theory says that every miner will choose the let in the most number of paying transactions as possible because if they don't the next miner will make more money. Unless mining becomes a cartel (in which case we have bigger problems) this will never be a problem.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:25:24
I don't understand why you wouldn't want zero fee transactions. They are good for the network.

The only reason any company could dump pollution into the River is because the ownership of the River was public and therefore socialized between every citizen. If a private entity owned the River they would never allow pollution to be dumped into their River because it would reduce its value.

I would use cgminer and I've been happy mining at give-me-ltc.com. That being said I'm not sure what miner works best on nvidia cards so you might have to do some research. 
Edit: After doing some research I found out you will only be getting around 126 Khash. That is equivalent to a low end AMD card and you will only make around 50 cents a day. So if you think that is worth you time go for it, I find it interesting so even if you won't make much money that is a another reason to mine. You also have to remember it will slightly shorten the lifespan of your card.

So even if the trading site goes down I will still get a dividend and can sell my stock elsewhere?

Well anything that is limited has value but what I was pointing out is that it doesn't matter that it needs a bitcoin protocol extension. It can still be done. I doubt they will change the bitcoin protocol because zerocoin is really complicated but there is no reason it can't be implemented elsewhere and still be useful. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:43:15
You can set a mining programs to only use one card or use both at less than 100% on the same rig. Nvidia cards are worse for mining than AMD cards but you won't be able to use an AMD and a nvidia card on the same rig. If you want to get a card just for mining buy an asic because they are much more efficient at mining than a GPU and GPUs are becoming increasingly less cost efficient. Mining litecoins is also much more profitable than mining bitcoins right now if you are doing it with a GPU.

I don't think anyone is buying usb miners to makd money. They are buying them to be part of the network at a low cost. It fills a niche no one knew existed until friedcat though of it. They also take nearly no power since I think a usb socket only puts out .2 amps at like 3 volts so they are cheap to run.
@_date: 2013-07-05 02:47:30
So you want less companies to use bitcoins?

@_date: 2013-06-06 02:51:05
I'm not sure how increasing the difficultly would help ASICMiner since they have 21% of the networks hashing power but besides that misconception you are right. It is a good business move and people are buying them for a reason. If I had 1000 bitcoins sitting in my wallet I would buy one just to play with. I could run it in the background 24-7 with no noise, it would take no power, they look cool, and I could buy one immediately. 
Just because they will most might take years to pay off doesn't mean there's no reason to buy one. It's a cool piece of technology. They buyers know what they are buying.

I still do not understand how buying more will somehow make you profitable in the future. Unless you are buying in bulk and getting a large discount 1 ghash for $200 will be just as likely to turn a profit as 100ghash for $20000. You seem to be saying investing more hashing power will somehow make you more likely to make a profit at higher difficulty.

Block size has nothing to do with mining the block. In theory a miner could choose to accept 0 transactions in a block and they will still get 25 BTC. They just do it so they get transaction fees and to help support bitcoin since it costs the nothing.

I disagree. If testing by mining is absolutely required why not let them make extra money. It's a business and I would rather a company do burning tests and make some bitcoins then just give them away. There's no reason for them to throw away "free" bitcoins. In theory this would let them sell cheaper products.

I bought 1 share at 1.25 bitcoins. I'm happy with the dividends so I don't see a reason to sell and I don't like to speculate. I bought a share because it seemed like a good investment and nothing has changed so I don't plan on selling. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:42:25
No the passthrough basically works like an exchange. They buy a bunch of stocks and then people can buy them and trade them but the passthrough holds them for you. So if you sell your stock it is worth whatever other people on the passthrough will pay for it. While you don't have the physical stock you basially own shares that can't be traded outside of the passthrough. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:44:35
And how would you trade these assets? If they aren't liquid they are worth nothing. Also what would you use them more. Most machines used for production use computers.
@_date: 2013-06-26 02:15:56
Yes. But mine litecoins with it. Right now that is more profitable  and it will probably stay that way as more asics get turned on. If you want bitcoins you can just convert litecoins to bitcoins. Check this to see what coin in more profitable at the moment.

Lets assume he bought bitcoins back when they cost a dollar. Since the price has gone up to $100 the value of his investment has gone up 100x which is a 10,000% return on investment. 
I can't predict what the value of bitcoins will be in a year but if you put in $5000 a year ago when the value was $12 you would have around 416 bitcoins which is worth $44,500. That's about a 900% ROI which is huge.

First of all calm down. You act like no one has every disagreed with you.


Then you disagree with yourself in your response. 


Either you are an idiot or someone who came here to troll because you just pointed out one important use bitcoins has. The illegal drug industry is a $60 billion dollar business in the United States. That by itself would be a reason to justify bitcoins 900 million market cap. 
This goes right into the other use. Getting around the government. There are many products people want to buy, that governments have banned. For example in Canada there are lifesaving drugs that are banned because their cost is too high. I could see a use for bitcoins there. Or getting around currency controls in authoritarian countries and hiding money from government taxes on wealth like in Cyprus. Perhaps you want to send money to relatives in your home country and don't want to use wiring services with high fees.
There you go I gave you 4 uses, 1 of which you said yourself.

You could cut the maximum transactions allowed on a block by 1/4.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:43:46
No it wouldn't be a good business move since they want to control ~25% of the market and the more rigs they put up the more it will cost. They pay dividends in bitcoins and if their fiat expenses are lower they can pay more the shareholders. They don't care if their competitors are also doing well.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:16:43

I'm not saying you will lose money but you seem to be implying scale helps you with profitability. Since mining doesn't scale quantity doesn't matter. If you make money you will make money with 1 unit or 100 and it will pay off at the same rate. Except I guess you bought in bulk.

Hmm. Wouldn't it increase security because the odds of someone with 30% of the hashing power getting 40 vs 10 blocks. From the math I can do it seems that there would be a 1.2% chance every week someone with 30% of the network could do a 51% attack over 10 blocks and 2.5 * 10^-18 they could get 40 blocks. 
Edit: I guess as more asic miners go online you could argue getting 30% of the network is getting increasingly more difficult. But asic mining also has it's downsides since all you need is 1 fab to print enough chips to get 51% of the network.

It's really not a big deal I was just wondering if the community has created a good solution. It's not a big deal now but I can imagine a time when people create hundreds of paper wallets and stores just scan those to receive Bitcoin. That would be useful for people without smartphones or who use offline wallets. I was hoping we created an easy way to do this but I guess it will take me like 30 seconds to make each wallet. I've honestly spent 10x more time trying to find an easier solution then it would take me to just copy each address individually.

No. US bonds are basically the best loans you can buy. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the US. China owns like 800 billion out of something like the 14 trillion in debt the US has. If China sold their loans investors would be more than happy to buy them. There is no lack of demand for US debt. 
The reason countries buy US treasuries is it devalues their currency. Obviously the US has a trade imbalance with China. That should increase the Yen's value to USD. However if they buy bonds with Yen it keeps the Yen from gaining value to USD. This lets them export products for a cheaper price and boosts their export industry. Chinese bond purchases are not a conspiracy or done to help the US. Japan does the same thing and I believe owns more US bonds than China even though Japan has more debt than the US.

Most stocks pay much less than 10% a year in dividends. I would completely happy if I only got .3 bitcoins a year. You also have to remember they have more hashing power they can bring online and they sell mining hardware.
