I get so angry hearing that daft argument, people simply don't get how mining works when they postulate this ignorant pov, sadly the loud ones get more attention than the sensible ones.  
I went to a bankers meeting where this happened, they were so pro Ethereum and R3 at the time because of this thinking and somehow those other chains solved any state risk??  Never heard such blatant profiteering of ignorance before. 
I lost all sympathy when one startup mentioned they used Ethereum but will branch it to their own private chain later for safety and scalability for banks :)

It's very different, bank accounts store summed totals and whilst you are right that banks are more traceable, they don't leak information to the public. Ie you can't tell how much money someone owns receiving a bank transfer.
Also you can extract cash from a bank knowing it's totally untraceable... Cash is cumbersome, unsuitable for online commerce and being phased out in a digital age so a digital currency will fill this emerging void.  For bitcoin to remain the strongest currency out there it needs this property.

Whilst I agree, we don't know what bitfinex did with the limits. They may have had a unique account for each person and a per account limit above what was stolen.
The may also have exposed the backup keys so bitgo had no control over the funds... This would be my guess at this stage.
I'd be looking carefully at who could have access to this backup key as seems likely they leaked it accidentally, or an inside job or there was a physical break in.  
Too early to say but that backup key with access to their db is enough to do this without bitgo being able to stop it.

Thanks for the links, seems incredible that bitgo would actually signed these transactions.  My hunch is still that the private backup key was used, not bitgo signing them but that's based the possibly flawed logic that if bitgo were signing them it certainly would bring their entire business model into question.
Another option is someone derived a root private key used by the backup or bitgo based on the many transactions coming from bitfinex's HD wallet.  
Again, highly unlikely but will be interesting to see what comes of it.

It's complicated, we get it, but inflation is not the magic variable for a currency, just like fractional banking isn't perfect to prevent hoarding due to bank ponzis.
Bitcoin doesn't pretend to solve either, it merely gives a common unit of undisputed value around the world in an Internet age to help build robust currencies.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:00:55
You make an interesting point, as bitfinex survives it's likely to put a steady buying pressure of ~$60m as they replace the coins whilst the stolen coins will need to remain dormant or mixed for a v long time before they can be used again.

It typically takes 4-7 days to sync depending on the speed of your hardware.
You can improve the time by modifying the bitcoin.conf file and adding
for instances but it will still take days to sync.
Once you have downloaded it, I'd highly recommend backing it up to a USB drive or something similar to save having to download it again should it become corrupted.
Right now this "out of the box experience" is painful due to this syncing but once you're up and running it's smooth sailing.
And no, it won't sync when hybernated or in standby but will resume from where you left off if you close the machine down.

I think Fan777Dango has done a good job explaining multisig so won't go into details but to answer your specific question I will try to elaborate.
You simply need the recipient to work with you to create a multisig address. These addresses start with a 3 to highlight they operate differently.
There are a few ways to do it with either the multisig op code or use pay to script hash, the latter being more flexible where you can do some really inventive stuff.
For your example however as a paying customer all you need is a public key as provided by the seller and your own public key. 
The paying customer(you) now sets up an additional transaction to transfer (B) multisig funds to the merchants own final address in say 7 days time using the checklocktime feature. Both you and the merchant sign this transaction so it's ready to use as soon as 7 days pass.
You also set up a transaction to return all the funds (less the mining fees) back to your address and you sign it (C).
You now broadcast your first transaction to send your funds to this multisig address so now the seller sees you have indeed committed the funds.(A)
The merchant now can easily return your funds by signing and broadcasting C at anytime.
After 7 days however the merchant has fill control over the funds.
This is a bit contrived and unlikely to be used as it's complicated and the only protection it offers is the merchant can't spend those funds for 7 days.
A more likely scenario is using multi signatories to do Escrow which is vastly better.  Conventional banking charge backs are essentially a poor man's version of this powerful feature.

Nope, just wishful thinking to get us there ;)  
I'm still not sure why the simple route of having a snapshot included in builds is not done.  This literally copies everything they have on a pruned node (say it's 1Gb of data).
From here it verifies the PoW in each of the blocks is correct to make sure someone hasn't put a dodgy snapshot in.  Next the node is prevented from relaying transactions until it has done X blocks itself via the regular P2P network ( say a days worth to be sure it's using the main chain).  Now you have a fully running pruned node where PoW is unlikely to be faked because it would be costly to try and equally would be quickly detected.
* Mining machines would still run a full node.
* If they are working on an invalid chain their node will quickly detect this.

If you are touching USD you need to make sure you are licensed if you plan on transacting over a certain amount.
That certain amount may be &gt; $0 because cryptocurrencies are new so not sure if the rules are crystal clear.
If nothing else, make sure you do the AML/KYC compliance to ensure you don't end up with an orange jumpsuit.  Generally it is a good business that more and more are doing, just do it right because if you're successful people will notice and you need to make sure you're doing it legally.
Some sites get around this by doing P2P exchanging because you're not actually the money transmitter however I'd still get legal advice.

I believe Quantum entanglement would only be used for key exchange at the very start, ie you can detect if your key was sent successfully without being intercepted. After this point you'd use regular block cipher cryptography since to brute force the key is unfeasible even with a QC.

I tend to agree however I wouldn't be surprised if it was the result of a think tank of people tasked to do something disruptive with banks who have an unhealthy amount of power and this was the result of one of the many attempts.

So would that mean an exchange issuing a ETC withdrawal would add in a reference to an ETC blockhash and ETH to a different blockhash?  I.e. you say they 'can' make conditional transactions inspect but is it now required they do this to allow ETC/ETH to co-exist?
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:30:22
Whilst true, and at the risk of sounding like pumping an alt, iota is not blockchain based but tangle based to allow scalability in time(it doesn't yet though). It is incredibly early days, just saying that bitcoin probably needs to address scalability and fungibility to remain dominant.
@_date: 2016-08-01 12:18:29
Thanks, yes this is the bit I've been struggling to understand though.  If the exchange issues a transaction for a user to send some ETC to a users ETC address, these funds (by definition) must also be valid on ETH and the transaction would eventually appear on ETH too. 
It sounds like sQtWLgK is saying ETH transactions however are all tagged to be based on an ETH blockhash so can't be included in the ETC chain even if everything else was allowed.  
If that's the case it explains a lot but seems incredible the exchanges have done this because it means the exchanges are the ones pushing a minority fork, not miners and must be non-trivial for them to create these transactions using the regular clients.

You are missing at least 1 word.  Could it be you ignored one word on purpose to prevent someone from easily copying it?
Alternatively perhaps one of the single words you've typed in should actually be two words.
Finally are you certain you got that seed from Electrum and not another wallet that may be using a different technique?
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:11:31
You could create a multisig transaction to send the funds and a subsequent refund transaction that will only be accepted after a period of time. It would require cooperation from the receiving party.
It's sort of how payment channels already work.
I'm not aware how you can do it in a single transaction though.

Paper wallets are great for really long storage/gifts/professional long term storage/etc... however I'd suggest 95% of users would be much better with an HD wallet like your multibit one (Electrum/Bread/MyCelium/Copay).
You should only need to remember those ~13 words and once you have written those down it doesn't matter if your wallet is destroyed, deleted from the computer, whatever.... You can immediately access your funds again from any computer anywhere with just those 13 words and a compatible HD client.
This way an HD wallet is like coldstorage in that you can create one, get a deposit address from the client and delete the wallet from your PC.
Now you just send funds to that deposit address and no one can spend them.  At a later date when you do want to spend them you just install a bitcoin HD wallet, recover your wallet with those words and you can spend the funds again/delete the wallet again if necessary.
The major advantage of this is spending the funds for you is easy, with paper wallets it's not.  A paper wallet requires you to create a new wallet, send the funds there after you've spent some other wise risk opening yourself up to the small risks of exposing your public key.
Don't get me wrong, paper wallets are still very helpful for long term holders and corporations BUT there is a lot to be said for simplicity in usability.

It's not about accepting it, it's about exclusively accepting it and people want that service.
If Alibaba only accepted bitcoin for international transactions thereby offering instant global payments to suppliers in a common global currency that would make the exchange price go mental as demand would soar.

I have not seen a flood of mining machines on eBay so the miners must be confident they will survive the halving with half the rewards.  They'd be mad selling their equipment after the halving since those old devices will be unviable to use.  My hunch is they only upgraded half their machines to the latest and during the halving will simply turn off their old hw.
It does mean supply will halve so unless demand is somehow artificially held high at the moment, economics states the price will increase gradually until the equilibrium is reached again.

Any chance you can do an ELI21 with some basic knowledge of quantum effects on how a transaction happens.  I.e. a scientific america version of just how does the coin change ownership from one person to another or get subdivided?
The paper is a really interesting concept but I struggle to see how the hardcoded physical printed book of the blockchain could hold all the information about the minted coins future ownership without this book needing 'updates', metadata or holding quantum state.
I mean the paper appears to focus on how to mint the coins via shards and IDs ( I won't pretend I followed it enough to fully understand but I think I got the gist of it) but I found very little I could comprehend about the actual future transaction process.
Would really love to know this as I think you're onto something groundbreaking here...

IMHO Bitcoin is looking to be the backbone to derive other financial protocols on, i.e. the ultimate settlement layer everyone can trust.

Sure and banks will **never** have negative interest rates.  
It's not speculative delusional wishful thinking to arrive at this possibility, it's simply following the logic of "Why would people *prefer* to denominate their products and services in USD or Euros or Yen and use a closed financial payment model where they pay a fee and yet neither trading party is related to those currencies?"
The main answer is because that's what we've done so far because there was no alternative.  That's clearly as strong of a statement as saying "Polar bears don't eat sheep"... I mean, yes it's factually true because there are no sheep in the Arctic but we all know it won't end well for sheep if polar bears adapt to warmer weather.
Sending funds internationally with a common impartial unit of value is clearly the ideal solution people would design if history didn't play a role... right now, bitcoin is the only serious contender for an online global unit of value that matches the ideal money criteria (instantly transferable, supply limited, not controlled by any country or individual, divisible, fungible, etc..)  .  It may not happen in the next decade but I'm confident it will happen.
Those saying it won't be bitcoin based are inadvertently asking for something vastly more disruptive to happen... if bitcoin experiment were to fail it's only because something even more aggressive disrupts the financial world at an even faster rate.
Pretending the banks will not be effected is overlooking the obvious... this is merely a natural evolution of money now we use the internet.   Now decentralised digital money has been invented and shown to work, banks and payment systems will need to adapt to survive.

This analogy is not equivalent, you're saying that it would only help lemonade stands which is indeed pointless.  
A more appropriate analogy is LN is equivalent to setting up a prepaid debit card system whereby you have to top up the card first.   To get your money back from the card you have to phone up customer services and wait 30 mins for them to return your unspent money.
Early days you'll have American Express, Diners club and Kashcard.  Sometimes you'll need more than one card to make a payment (i.e. more than one channel open), eventually though, one card(channel) should be sufficient for everyday spending.

They can certainly try, but when you have people who are able to buy/sell the asset as easily as buy/selling futures contracts you can see why it's in everyone's interest to balance the two over the long term.  I.e. people want to make money on it going up and down.  If it consistently goes in only one direction it means there will be no takers on the other side of the contract making the boom/bust cycles more extreme.
My hunch is as soon as a nation announces settlement can be in bitcoin (or perhaps an American ETF) we can expect to see yet another surge in value because it has become more useful again.  
If we're lucky that is a few years away because we're not quite ready to take that sort of traffic until the layer2 stuff becomes mainstream.

You're right, I'm uncomfortable saying it because I believe it's bitcoins second biggest issue right now.
(It is being addressed though!) Imagine you buy something and the person you bought something off pays for something unlawful. 
The criminal person who offered the product /service (eg selling a fake passport) is found and arrested. An agency would now like to trace who 'bought'  that passport.
That agency's only current option is to look at the history of the coins used. They'd see you bought the coins on a regulated exchange and you paid someone (or just moved your funds) who later used those coins to purchase the passport.  What does this mean? Well if they couldn't obtain the buyers info from the merchant, expect a phone call/email/letter/knock at the door as that agency would like to know who you sent the coins to.
OK, it may not be common practice because it's a lot of work and doing something like selling passports for bitcoin is very stupid as there are other ways they'll get caught but using this as a simple example.  
With cash you don't have to worry about future transactions because it is totally fungible with no history.
This fungiblity is a desirable feature of money by definition therefore to be the strongest global digital currency it needs this. If bitcoin doesn't do it, another absolutely will.

A QR code is nothing more than a fancy way to type out exactly that text that is the address or private key shown below it.  It is harder to corrupt a QR code than a written piece of text however since QR codes have redundancy in so you can obscure part of the image and it still recreates the text.
Also the only bit of important information is the private key... you can generate the address from the private key.  (You can also see why it's possible to regenerate both QR codes from the private key text too).

I believe through an obscure bug the very first 50btc are unspendable but I expect your question is more about if the inventor sold some early coins.
Yes it would cause a temporary price drop as it would be a significant change given billions of dollars worth of bitcoin ‘could’ now be thrown on the market so would make people cautious.  
After this point one of a few things can happen.
1. a small amount may be put on an exchangeand markets would eventually stabilise again.. life goes on.
2. They could dump a lot and stop, again life goes on.
3. The could dump a lot regularly and drop the price as supply would increase faster than demand. 
4. They could dump everything at once, this would be insanely dramatic, hollywood movie style but after the drama it would stabilise again... 
5. Most likely option, they’d move in an OTA transaction rather than through an exchange, at this point very little effect would happen other thanthe initial shock that the old coins are still controlled by someone/something.
Ie it would make headlines because its not happened yet but nothing catastrophic in the grander scheme of things.

The average electricity price in America is $0.12 based on this graph 
Let's use best case scenario though and use China as the cheapest source of electricity so we say it costs around $0.08 per kWH.  
Using the cheapest rate possible of 1 kWH = $0.08 in a day it is simply 24 x $0.08 = $2.11 per kW day.
Bitcoin network hash rate = 1189496033 GHash per second = (1,189,496,033,000,000,000 Hashes)
1GHash takes around 0.25w of energy to calculate for the most efficient chips around.  Therefore 1,189,496,033Ghash x 0.25Watts = 297374008 Watts = 297374 kWatts
Therefore with the cheapest electricity and most efficient hardware the network costs **AT LEAST 297374 x $2.11 per day = $627,459 per day**
This means at least $627,459 is invested into the bitcoin network to pay for these bills.
Note this doesn't cover overheads of amortization of hardware, rent on facilities, network costs, staff costs, host hardware, mining hardware is normally less efficient that 0.25W/GHash and taxes on earnings have been ignored so this daily cost is merely a lower bound and the actual cost is far higher!
When halving happens if the demand remains constant and the supply is halved?  We're all taught exactly what happens in economics 101 so will be interesting to see this happen in a real environment... economists couldn't ask for a better experiment!

Keep in mind it shouldn't matter if Circle are using bitcoin or any other blockchain to drive their internal ledger (I'd be shocked if they would use a blockchain as it's usually wasteful for private systems), what matters is that users can buy and sell bitcoin to interact with their well known banking system while also allowing their clients to pay a bitcoin address and receive bitcoin easily. 
I.e. bitcoin now enables paying and receiving funds from sources that are no longer just banks.  These might be other people, companies or even just computers.  This ability to transfer value in an agnostic way from one system to another is bitcoin's killer app, I think Barclays have clocked onto why it's a huge thing.
Circle can't fake that last part and must use bitcoin to interact on the bitcoin network regardless to their internal systems.

I think you've got some great answers by people already so won't got through each but just to summarise...
The miners take a bunch of random data, call it {X} and run it through the hash function to get the number H.  If H is less than a value as set by the bitcoin protocol rules, that miner is said to have solved the block so can share it with everyone who can quickly validate it that the hash of {X} is indeed less than the target number everyone is looking for.
So {X} actually consists of transactions people push on the network, every time a new transaction is received {X} changes so the hash changes.  Now typically miners are wanting to show they are doing work so inside {X} is a value called a nonce which they can change to be whatever number they like.  Each time they change this nonce, it clearly changes the set {X} slightly so gives a radically different hash H value.  Miners simply keep changing this nonce and a time field and perhaps an extranonce and keep getting new H's.  Eventually someone finds the solution and can share it to the world.
The trick is that each miner also can include one single special transaction in {X} which is called a coinbase transaction.  The rules allow a miner to credit any bitcoin address with a coinbase transaction up to the current reward level (currently 25BTC).  This means {X} contains new coins the miner sends to their address and if they find a valid H they can share the block with everyone thereby creating new coins for the economy that the miner owns to begin with (Coinbase transactions can only be spent after 100 blocks after it have been made I believe).

Hasn't there already been Auracoin from Iceland and MintCoin from Bank of Canada?
Not sure starting yet another alt coin is a sensible idea these days but perhaps if they've solved the scalability it may make sense.
The issue they have is blockchain non-scalable solutions are only useful for settlement.  Given "Bank of ???" is a nation's currency they're talking about settlement with other countries.  Now if you have a friendly agreement with other countries they may agree to valuing the new alt coin as a means of settlement however in times of distrust or an unfriendly nation they may simply not recognise it as having any value but only recognise the international unit of value such as gold and now bitcoin.
I.e. they'd do better investing in btc than launching a weaker coin foreigners will be unwilling to accept.

A hashing algorithm is lots of bit logic to essentially create a function F such that the output looks random but is deterministic.  What that means is if I put the value '1' into the hash, I get say the value 4568347 returned.  Every time anyone puts '1' in to that same hash function they will also get the same 4568347 returned. 
If however I put '2' in I get another random number like '3182345'.  
The trick is there is no short cut or reversable way to associate the output to the input of a hash other than doing the actual hash calculation.  I.e. you have to keep guessing random numbers on the input that produce an output &lt; difficulty.  
It takes a while to get your head around it but basically it doesn't matter if you increment the nonce, change the header by adding more transactions, change the timestamp, etc... they all have exactly the same effect of just giving you another guess at finding a valid mining answer where the result is less than the difficulty target to be considered a 'found block'.  
So typically miners will pick some random number to start the nonce on (or start at 0) and increment from there.  Anytime they can pick up a new transaction the nonce could restart from 0 or they can just keep counting up, makes no odds really.  
I.e. each combination of tx set, nonce, timestamp, extranonce is just 1 guess.  Clearly the bitcoin network does exaillion guesses per second so the network on average finds a winner only once every 10 minutes on average.

If not try visiting it from a different browser on the same machine. If still an error try step 2. If no error your browser is infected or the ssl has been rejected. Reinstall the browser perhaps, clear cache, check for
Malware, etc.
Step 2 try with your wifi on another computer. Of same error step 3, otherwise its possible your router or dns was maliciously edited.  Arr you using VPN? If so try without and visa versa
Step 3 try another internet connection via mobile hotspot on same computer or equivalent. If no error its likely your isp or dns.
With error its your computers cached dns, redirect table, tunnelling or simply malware causing it. Wipe OS and reinstalling may fix it, may require new hd to remove rootkit possibilities.

Yes you need the old one.
You might be able to retrieve it from a formatted HD.  If you did a full lowlevel format you need a forensics person to do it and I've yet to hear it actually work although in theory they can recover old/deleted data through some sensitive devices.  It's costly though, so unless you've lost &gt; $10k I doubt it's worth it (but hold the HD just incase!)
If you did a quick format, yes absolutely you can retrieve the data.  Just buy one of those disk scanning tools (e.g.  ) 
The issue is you need to make sure you're not using that HD anymore.  Anything you save to it may overwrite the files.  You need blockchain.info's support to figure out which file you're after because I don't know where it was stored (is it a webcookie or local storage or something else) or what it was named.

It won't... it's merely a way to reduce the amount spent on electricity supporting the network.
There will be half as much bitcoin dumped on the market to pay for miners electricity bills in local currency so there may be a price rise given supply will reduce.
I.e. one could think of it as (12.5btc x 24 x 6 = 1800btc ) ~$700,000 worth of bitcoin automatically purchased every day after the halving.  With bitcoin's valuation of $6B ( that implies a daily price increase of ~1.1% to begin with... clearly that's unlikely as there are people with emotions and speculation involved.
Question is will demand remain constant or drop for some reason... we can be pretty certain it's not going to be a smooth ride remaining at ~$400.  
I'd just keep in mind your 1btc now is still worth 1btc after the halving, the rest is just guessing and no one really knows.

It's only a concern at the moment because the fees have to remain painfully high to ensure people put the effort into making LN viable.  Treading water and doing nothing but expanding blocksize at this stage would guarantee obsolescence given new approaches like Raicoin, Byteball, iota and others will vastly outperform blockchains.
Once it is proven and becomes understood by many the technology will also be distributed on litecoin, altcoins, etc.  With LN cross chain atomic swaps it means people will flock to the chain with the lowest fees to get on the LN network which inevitably will be denominated by bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:43:48
But they’re dangerous when redeeming since most people don’t bother to do offline signing or worse they leak the information by doing a scan.

@_date: 2018-01-10 12:00:35
Think of LN as a debit card, there is an upfront cost to getting your prepaid debit card (the on chain tx).  There is a fee to close your account too.
Once you have your debit card though you can spend those funds as easily as you like with no significant fees.  What's more you can receive money without fees too.
Why is this better than a debit card?  For a few reasons...
* Firstly it is far more secure than a debit card.  It is designed to work with the internet, non of the other payment facilities open to us have this feature.
* Secondly it is instant, no settlement period of months like you have with paypal or debit cards.
* Thirdly it is truly global, you can pay someone on the other side of the planet instantaneously.
But why is it better than bitcoin by itself?
* It has low fees to use and scales well beyond what big blocks can offer.
* Microtransactions are now feasible and not considered spam.
* It has true fungibility, this means the history of the coins does not effect their value at all.  Whilst not a problem for bitcoin yet it will be and LN solves this.

Someone already launched a version on mainnet but generally only usable for testing and those heavily involved in the tech side of it.  In time user friendly wallets will appear, it will be slow adoption and gain pace over time as more and more people learn how to use it.
Right now tools are still in development (i.e. some you can't even easily detect when a deposit has been made or the balance in your channel in one implementation... these are 'todos' which just need time to complete but is just about usable already).

As I understand it you wouldn't be the only person with the redeeming tx, there must be a counterparty who also has it.  I.e. worst case scenario it means the channel gets closed so you pay a mining fee but not sure why you'd lose any further money than that?

Yes, the seed generates the xpriv and xpub numbers.  After you've typed the seed in, that text should not be stored anywhere on your computer.  
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:43:13
This would mean a tx fee of $29/4 = $7.  Ok LTC has larger blocks so perhaps 10Mb blocks would give $0.70 tx fees as an example.  
However the real issue is this is using today's volume, for a crypto to become a mainstream trading success it will have easily 100x the volume we see now (perhaps even 10,000x).  
A blockchain approach will not solve this, it requires LN or other layer 2 solutions to be viable.

Id suggest not to.
Use an hd wallet approach or buy a hardware wallet.
Crypto has moved on from using paper wallets to store funds.  Paper wallets are great for gifts and freebies or long term cold storage, not for usage because redeeming from paper is non trivial to do securely.  
Eg redeeming part is time consuming to create new paper wallets. Reusing a spent from address is reducing security. Importing a private key to an online wallet is incredibly risky. Ensuring the new paper wallet is generated correctly is difficult to confirm. Removing any online leak risk when printing a paper wallet is also non trivial.
The bip for encrypting private keys is not widely supported in wallets. 
Ie there is little upside but significant risk moving from one paper wallet to another.

Spot on!  Not sure why this isn't the top comment.
Bitcoin is not USD based and they've linked USD on all the other conversions.

Guess this is because it's new and a lot of people won't know what BTC or XBT mean
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:40:08
Lightning is still very much an experiment.  It does look incredibly helpful in certain situations but equally has it's own issues to overcome (such as needing to be online to facilitate a transaction, how opening/closing channels is done in practice since there are fees associated to it, how to receive more funds than you put in).
1. Integrating LN directly into the bitcoind is probably the wrong approach IMHO.  It is fine to co-exist however and have an installer that asks if you want to also install LN but it is good practice to keep software as independent components.    
Also on that note I strongly believe the bitcoind client needs refactoring into 3 parts.   (I believe Gavin suggested this and I fully support this view)
a) A simple concise core of blockchain p2p connection/blockchain validation part.
b) An optional wallet that interfaces to (a).
c) The mining component (mainly for testnet/regtest) to mine blocks and again communicates with (a)
2.  Yes, this is getting easier.  There is a lot of learning and things in flux at the moment but as they stabilise this will become as easy as sending email is these days compared to in the 90s.
3. Yes, that again is coming but LN needs to be out of beta before a financial institution officially supports it.  There is just so many risks on new technology so we can't rush it.

It sounds like it might just be a wallet glitch, an interesting one that needs fixing but nothing more.  I expect your coins are still safe and sound.  
You could try using a different wallet if you need to, something like mycelium on a mobile phone for instance.
I don't really know what is causing the glitch but it may be that you have a large gap in receiving addresses so the wallet is stopping searching for received tx's because a block of say 10 unused receive addresses exist before a payment to say the 11th (I'm guessing at 10,11, not sure what gap electrum uses by default).
That said, the more likely issue is the server your electrum wallet is connected to is blocked or not working as expected, you could try pointing it to another server or run your own to be certain it works.
Now I've typed it, my bet is it's your network is filtering out or editing traffic to the electrum server which is causing the intermittent glitch.  Is there a rescan option and/or are you able to try on a different internet connection (perhaps setup a VPN if your ISP is messing with your traffic).
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:27:52
Running downloading and running the main bitcoind client from [ should be what you're after.  You'll need at least 1Tb of disk space dedicated to run a full node.
You can also run a node on googlecloud or aws virtual machine whereby it's up and running all the time but running your own node is somewhat better in that you physically have a full copy of the blockchain.
If you just want to use bitcoin you can download wallets like Electrum on desktop machines or MyCelium on mobile devices.
Feel free to post on as well if you're after technical detail... a lot of posts on this group get lost amongst the memes and price talk.

I would guess it is when signing a transaction to actually spend the money it will ask for your 2FA to do anything with the private key?  
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:52:07
Yes exactly.  
With HD wallets you have a seed that generates an xpriv number used to derive all your private keys.  The clever thing about HD wallets is the seed can also generate an xpub number which will generate all the addresses used by the wallet but without knowing the xpriv/private keys.  This means with the xpub you can scan through the blockchain to find all your transactions to derive your wallet balance safely.  There is no way of spending the funds with an xpub key.  
Electrum probably just uses this xpub key without 2FA since it's fairly safe other than calculating your wallet balance.    Only when the xpriv/private keys are used to sign a payment transaction or message is the extra security needed.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:47:19
V true.  For an exchange that has it's reputation on the line they'd be mad supporting LN at this stage when even the developers have said 'dont use real money on this yet'.
It will happen but right now everyone is still getting to grips with using it.  Using little bits of money individually is good as long as people know it's a risk they are making in exchange for faster adoption of LN.

There is a historical trick that one mining company already used in mining called asic boost, I believe it is one of the reasons why bitcoin cash cane to exist although I never independently verified the claim.  
If sha256 had a weakness to improve the chance of finding 0s at the start (eg hash input numbers that are a multiple of 65535 produced say 1000x the chance of getting 0’s at the start) then it is likely the person discovering this advantage would mine by themselves and to the network it would just appear that this miner had 1000x the computing power they actually had.  If this trick were common place we would migrate to a better hashing algorithm.
To be clear, no such weakness is known to date!
Migration to a different algorithm has issues in that it allows for botnets to mine since no asics would exist for the new mining algorithm.  Basically its a world of pain to change but is certainly possible if sha256 were ever compromised.

Everyone loves giving advice. I wish you well and understand your sentiment. If Ln works I think your choice will be a good one.
That said, have a plan now and stick to it.
As you know many people say ‘oh man, wish Id bought $10,000 worth if ₿ in 2011, Id be sorted now’ glossing over the emotions of’i bought at $5 each, they are now $50 each, $500 each, $5000 each ...’
I mean very very few people would actually hold on through those crazy rises/dips of 10x return.  Equally many cashed out at $50 and never looked back.
Just saying, know your strategy now for up and down to avoid the emotional stress.
The halving ahead to bring ₿ inflation below most countries.
Political events like brexit will surely hurt euro/gbp value.
We are due another recession.
Ethereum is looking to stop inflation too
₿ LN is looking promising to work
It still has no serious competition 
Libre or other equivalents will simplify on-boarding to ₿
All those reasons look positive for the value increasing

A collision being found is merely a very small warning shot, it would still be a long long way from breaking it enough to give a competitive advantage in mining.
That said, if someone is able to do that it would probably be enough to replace or at least put an extra layer of hashing on top of the SHA256 solution.  
The migration would be pretty smooth tbh but the chance it is needed is pretty remote at the moment.
If SHA256 had a flaw discovered in it to significantly increase the chance of a nonce change getting more 0's at the start somehow, that would be more serious and harder to spot since whoever discovered it probably wouldn't make that advantage public until someone else discovered it.
At this point yes, as Satoshi said we would transition to another mining algorithm by fixing a block number for the transition.
It would have to be pretty definitive centralised control before that were to happen...
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:23:47
`- Each miner takes a few transactions from the transaction pool to form a block, does this mean every miner is just calculating his own block and every block being calculated is different?`
Yes.  Actually the first transaction in the block is the miner crediting themselves, as allowed by the rules, with the new coins to their own address.  The transactions inside the block however are probably very simliar between nodes since they all talk to each other and generally will have a copy of all the pending transactions wanting to go into the next block.
`- if not and there is only one block at a time, how does the network synchronize the one and only block being calculated across every miner? In other words, who decides which block is currently being the block to be calculated??`
Yep, there is no such 'one block'.  It's merely a race where pending/new transactions are added to the miners own unconfirmed block and they are mining away to find a valid number that would make the block valid and therefore can be transmitted around the network as confirmed.
`- if yes, after someone successfully mined a block, does every other miner simply stop because there is a risk his block might contain the same transaction? Also the transaction pool will be reduced of the transaction of the mined block right?`
`Say Miner A is 90% (in theories, I know it's guessing) into finishing his block, but Miner B finished his block first, Miner A now has to discard his entire progress and start a new right?`
Yes, when a miner receives notification of a valid new block it will drop any transactions found in that new block from it's new mining block.   It will also update their block header to point to this newly received block and continue the process.
The thing I initially struggled to understand is that new transactions are instantly put into the new block miners are trying to solve.  Since they are guessing random numbers anyhow, adding in new transactions is like simply guessing another random number so safe to do and doesn't mean they're starting again or anything like that since the odds of finding a valid number is constant regardless to the contents of the block.
  I.e. they don't batch up transactions waiting until they finish processing the current block or hear about someone creating a new block, instead they add those new transactions immediately and all the time while mining.

A tx can have one or more outputs.  It is probably most common for them to have 2 outputs.  One output to the person being paid, the other output is change going back to the person who made the payment.
Remember a tx needs to gather a group of past transactions, enough to cover the payment to person.  This means there is usually change left over which is why 2 outputs are the norm.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:44:45
I could be wrong but it appears like you may have some wires crossed here.  Looking at the above commend when you say look at lines 122-124 in 
  
This array of outputs is because a transaction can have an array of outputs, not because an output can have an array of addresses.
This might be a red herring compared to what you're actually asking however.  
If you take a peek at this one... 
If you open up the scripts you'll see the output scripts used...

You should have two QR codes which is just a convenient way to enter the text next to the QR code.
One will be your address, this starts with a '1' and is safe to share with anyone.
The other is the private key, keep this secure and never enter it online or take a picture of the QR code unless you are intending to spend the funds.  It should start with a '5.....' if you're lucky.   (If it starts with a '6.....' you will need a password as well but I doubt they've done that)  
Easiest way is download and install MyCelium on your mobile phone if you're pretty confident it's not riddled with viruses. (Typically they will be ok unless you've been downloading dodgy apps and jailbreaking/rooting your phone)
Click on coldstorage and you should be able to sweep the funds.  Check the mining fees however, if you got $1 4 years ago it's probably worth around ~$50-300 these days and mining fees to send a transaction can be crazy high at $12 was the last time I checked on the app.
You can probably also install Electrum on a PC/mac and sweep the funds there too using import private key option.  This allowed for much better mining fees to be given, sadly the mycelium mining fees are just daft defaults at the moment.

For anyone who hasn't already learnt about this trick I thought I'd share this interesting tip I was taught. 
 
Our minds are incredibly good at remembering stories but we're rubbish at remembering arbitrary words/numbers.
To use this memory association simply create a story with your 24 seed words in, repeat the story to yourself making sure the keywords in the story are important and pronounced to be associated to strong emotional reactions.  Think about all your senses, achievement or sexual to ensure you remember the feeling of it rather than just memorising words.
Each sentence needs two of the words in and you make up sentence for each pair.  So if you have the words A,B,C,D  you create 5 sentences.  
* 1st sentence contains just A.
* 2nd sentence contains A,B.  
* 3nd sentence B,C.  
* 4rd sentence C,D.
* 5th sentence D.
Now you know the order of the words and should you forget one sentence it's easy to spot given the word is in the next sentence and is usually enough to jog the memory.
E.g. remember these 4 words from the testvector example...
    horn tenant knee talent 
A typical 5 sentence story could be something like this...
* I was reluctantly given a rhino **horn** by some sick poacher bastard
* My wife shoved the **horn** up my old **tenant**s backside because he cursed a lot.  
* The **tenant** was kissing his **knee** when you found him curled up on the orange rug.  
* His **knee** was made of metal which gave him a special **talent** to knee fart on demand.  
* The **talent** of knee farting is something Mr Cowell sponsors regularly.
The steel plate engraving backup is fantastic for locally stored backups in a safe but memory can travel with you safely.

Stay calm, it may just be the funds haven’t confirmed yet.  Check the receiving address on your nano matches what you typed in coinbase.
(Im not familiar with nano but usually you have to view old addresses if youve received funds since the address should change each time you receive money)
You can also check on a block explorer typing in your receive address to see any pending transactions to it.
If you share your address others can look for you too.(sharing an address is safe as long as you dont mind your reddit account being associated with the address for whatever reason)

Either I’ve overlooked things or people here are incredibly sexist assuming the op is a guy.
Anyhow, transferring half to a wallet is certainly best bet if amicable.
The fact you dont know this means you need it to be amicable otherwise the other half could just ‘donate it’ away to themselves and there’s nothing anyone can do about it.
Luckily it sounds like you’re still both friends and not needing to worry about that.
If its a lot of money get a hardware wallet like trezor or nano ledger to make sure it is safe.

I first heard it mentioned by Mike Hearn many years ago, not claiming he came up with the concept but just saying the idea has been around for a while.
It's that 'seriously??' moment with using bitcoin, basically computers can also own and control value, not just people.
You can write a script that is able to buy an item with bitcoin and be in control of it.  A self replicating taxi fleet is one 'simple' example of how it happens, the script checks the cars in for regular garage fixes, when it has enough funds it buys another driverless taxi car and replicates the code to this new taxi which now can do the same... essentially having an independent taxi baby.  
There is no person owner/controller of this system, just takes one person who kick starts the process writing that script and devise a way to purchase goods with bitcoin (e.g. openbazaar, ebay)
There are clearly challenges in writing that script in how to prevent people gaming it, how to get the taxis manufactured (currently the main bottleneck as driverless cards are not common commodities yet, how to get the insurance details to ensure the cars aren't just taken off the road, recharging/fuel which currently requires physical plugging in, etc...)
Other parts are pretty easy, integration with Uber, buying the car, garage services, replication.
It's almost inevitable to happen but I doubt taxi's will be the first autonomous agents made since there are lots of complexities to overcome compared to simpler AA's such as an online broker, online insurance or personal shopper.

The edit points to a multisig tx which will show multiple output addresses for a single output.
It simply allows a first to spend all of those output funds by a future tx if the multisig condition is met.  A multisig address can specify n of m signatures are required. Eg 1 of 3 to spend meaning any of those 3 addresses can spend it.
More often it is 2 of 3 meaning two signatures need providing to spend.  Greenaddress.it do this for allowing instant confirmed spends for instance since they sign on of the txs showing it cant be a double spend tx.
In these scenarios you will see multiple addresses for a single output but keep in mind ALL the ouput funds are spent in the future tx that usee it, you can’t stipulate 0.5 here and 0.3 there in a single output.
Hope that helps

No it just means the first contacts that were up for sale complete in January.  This dip is not surprising at all when you look at what futures offer.  You basically want to sell a futures contract when the price is high, lower the price of the asset after the sale before the contract completes.  Buy the cheap contracts people are offloading, rebuy the actual assets pushing the price back up, rinse and repeat until people cotton on what is happening and the price stabilises.
edit: just to answer your question, there are new contracts issued every period.  This period might be say 2 weeks but the contracts last for 2 months each I believe... I've not delt with them myself so someone can correctly me if I've misunderstood it.

If you sent your BTC to a BCH address you will have sent it to an address starting with a '1'.
If however you sent BCH to a segwit BTC address, stop everything, don't touch your BTC wallet and let us know so we can explain the steps necessary.
Assuming it is BTC-&gt;BCH address you're probably in luck.  Only you (or your jaxx wallet to be precise) has the private key that derives that 1xxxx address you've sent the funds to.   
First thing is to get the private key for that 1xxxx address, Jaxx allows you to view the private keys associated to each address so this should be pretty easy to do.
Go to Tools-&gt;Display Private Keys-&gt;Bitcoin Cash.  Find your 1xxxxx address you've sent the funds to.
Now you can retrieve the funds on the main Bitcoin network by treating this private key as a paper wallet and import that.
For instance you can use
To generate a tx that will send the funds from your 1xxxx address back to one of your bitcoin main net addresses.
Happy to share more details if you get stuck
(EDIT: Please for the love of everything check the mining fee before you broadcast your tx, there are too many stories of people not calculating the mining fee correctly and putting the entire amount in as a mining fee!!  You should only need a mining fee of around $1 to be safe)
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:22:04
This is rather misleading.  Segwit is only needed by LN enabled wallets, a wallet without LN featureset support has no significant benefit in using segwit other than slightly reducing fees.  These fees however are still very high so not sure it's worth the effort supporting segwit, it's more important to support LN.

If you had a balance of 2BTC and you sent 1BTC to person X, a transaction is made such that 2BTC is sent from your wallet where 1BTC goes to X and your change (2btc - 1btc - mining fee) goes to a new address that your wallet controls.  
All modern wallets create these change addresses for you automatically, could this be what has happened?
From what you have posted it looks like you got your funds from bitcoin.de and later sent two separate transactions where you did 
    1BTC to 1KWZijEpHotG1dRGq17LmP5y4qCGfXcn3Y  
and 
    1BTC to 16HPKzKP8MwELi4jAZ6eVmxfxY48i45Rxc 
both were made in 2013, so this isn't recent?
If you don't control either of these and it was done by accident you could only have copy/pasted that address from somewhere else, is it worth searching your records to see who you may have sent it to previously and contact them to return the funds.
Any chance you sent the funds back to an exchange?

Youre talking about sha256 (incredibly secure) ripmnd160 (very secure) and ecdsa ALL being broken... basically if that happens the Internet/mobile phones/games consoles/payment networks  are all entirely stuffed.
Being able to generate a public key to match a hash is impossible enough already, finding a private key to that public key is equally as difficult although technically more chance than finding that hash collision.

So it's very unlikely there is an exploit in bitcoind using port 8333,  never say never but given it's open source and how many people are involved in the project who are security/paranoid it's far safer technology than say Windows OS itself.
If defender has just started identifying password stealing software in your emails it is most likely the emails that are the culprit.  The reason it may only be showing up now is that you've connected your PC to the internet, windows defender has updated it's virus definitions and now able to spot old emails that have those viruses in.
If you have ever opened any of those emails in the past you can be pretty sure your computer is compromised so you need to reinstall it all.

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:04:22
If you signed up to an online wallet they typically control your bitcoin (unless it's blockchain.info which they do something different and you actually own the keys).
If you create a paper wallet from somewhere like bitaddress.org you can send your online funds to the address on your paper wallet.  Now you can redeem those funds on the paper wallet later by either importing the private key to another wallet or manually creating a transaction with the private key using something like coinb.in (do the private key signing step on an airgapped offline PC!)
Paper wallets are great for long term storing but do take a backup or two.
For larger amounts of money use a hardware wallet, it's less stress when you later redeem the funds and you can access the money very quickly.  Trezor and nano ledger are both excellent and are pretty cheap for such an advanced bit of kit.
Typically I suggest using an HD wallet now instead of paper wallets for general use, just easier to use and you can happily delete the wallet and restore it in months/years to come when you want to spend the money.
Good wallets are MyCelium on iOS/Android, Jaxx, Electrum and Armory if that helps...
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:22:50
No, Lightning network are still bitcoin transactions.  The difference is you only spend money to the miners when you need to establish a new channel or the trust with the person you are trading with breaks down.  In theory any malicious behaviour ends up in a channel being closed, a lucky miner receiving a fee and you and the participant both losing out on mining fees.
This means there is an incentive on both parties playing fairly since neither benefits from malice.
That said it does inspire the miner to act maliciously, but it's like saying to miners now, why don't you just deny all tx's except where the fee is &gt; $100?  They wouldn't do this because someone else will take the &lt;$100 fess and it generally would hurt the network and therefore hurt their btc value.  I.e. the miners are incentivised to make sure the network works smoothly so people use it to create/close channels and they make a tidy sum out of the regular easy mining fees.
LN is very much game theory in action though, whether it's successful or not depends on how easy it is for people to use, how safe it is for people to use and ensuring it scales to vast transactions per second (we're talking millions of tx / second eventually... and yes it's still a long way from this but is getting there).
If we can include signed invoices within LN from the outset I think this would be a massive win for society too.  Right now paying arbitrary bitcoin addresses is too technical.
Generally the future of bitcoin is exciting because LN can only fail if something even better takes it's place.
So far LN looks like the winning recipe, just the on/off ramps need to existing fiat systems need simplifying and perhaps this is something the banks will scoop up... my hunch is they're too lethargic to adapt and some young google V3 will own this space.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:27:24
Electrum/mycelium/jaxx are some popular ones.  You need to get a standard HD wallet like these so you just need to remember the backup words to access your money from any computer anywhere in the world.
Personally I'd say don't mess around, just get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Nano because at least you will sleep well should bitcoin value start to soar.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:46:16
Yes but typically you would wait for them to offer a tool to do it for you.  For example they did this with BitcoinCash but I've not seen anything regarding the bitcoin gold for instance.
It is possible to do it manually I believe by extracting the keys but you must be careful that you dont inadvertently expose or weaken the keys storing your real bitcoin... for this reason it's best to always withdraw all the funds when a fork happens and send the funds to a new address starting with the most valuable coins first and work your way back.

The chain must contain integer satoshi values.  Since LN are actual bitcoin transactions that have not been broadcast onto the chain so I can't see how subsatoshi transactions could be done with current technology.
It might be something to be added in future whereby subsatoshi balances have to exist in 'meta data' in a LN channel or layer 3 implementations that handle the micro transactions and rounded when settled.

Bread uses it's own non-standard HD path derivation so you need to send the money via a regular transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:02:07
No, Segwit IS the technology that was required to allow for LN to work efficiently.  
No further forks are required to use LN on the mainnet, the network is already fully capable of running it.  LN hasn't been deployed on mainnet yet simply because it needs a lot of testing and probably more importantly more wallets/tools need to be written around it.  This isn't going to be done quickly but it is happening.
Without segwit all transactions were malleable, this meant it was very troublesome to try and implement something like LN (and pretty much any automated contracts) since the unique ID for your tx could be tampered with and made verifying transactions happened difficult.  This is why segwit was wanted so much, not because of saving any diskspace/bw or blocksize, but because with it we can now issue transactions knowing the txid won't change.

With a private key you can derive the public key.  From the public key you can derive the address.
It should be a 1-1 relationship but like you say you can create different types of addresses for that same private key.
There is a compressed or uncompressed public key value from a private key.  These will result in 2 different bitcoin addresses that the private key can spend from.  There is also segwit address that uses a different script to spend the coins so again produces another bitcoin address that private key can access.
So for a real world example you can have say a private key like L5URAXqNaa4LGXCN3anuVsnENKpQK7LN91VFuDQirFg64xwf4b7S
From this you can generate these three addresses...
Uncompressed:   12AqAARgP83BhVPfaFoHJvjf9BwJUYfU33  
Compressed:   1PFsNyqsSE8SSAdaNsUstRTm4e9fCfudT1 
Segwit:  3QJQWHo3euTRGvL9UApiPivQefufCVaBBw 
As for brain wallets... (please don't use brain wallet), this depends on the derivation used to create the private key from the 'brain key'.  There probably is a standard but as a disclaimer \*brain wallets are not secure, do not use them going forward\*
That said, if you're just reclaiming a previous brain wallet you have to find the site you used to generate it.  [bitaddress.org]( is the most well known one so I'd start there.  This will inevitably create standard public keys starting with a '1' as segwit stuff is more modern where no one should be using brain wallets now.
So if not brain wallets or paper wallets what should I be using?
A 12 word HD Seed is the best bet which can derive an unlimited number of addresses to accept and spend from.  They are easy to memorise and generally standard.  Ideally you should use a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger to be extra safe if it's significant funds.  MyCelium also follows the HD standard so good to use.  Bread wallet is great but doesn't follow the derivation standard so don't use that.
Best of luck getting your funds and stay safe ;)

This is precisely why I feel confident that bitcoin is very early stage, 
The writer clearly has no idea how it works yet so understandably likely to think it's some flash in the pan/bubble that will disappear.

Transaction times are near instant, just post a tx and watch it propogate on a blockexplorer.  Confirmations to prevent double spends take in the region of 10 mins but can take up to an hour.  LN and 3rd party counter signed tx's like greenaddress allow this to happen instantly so no confirmation is required.
Fees are crazy high but that's needed to drive the importance of having LN exist.  No point just making bigger blocks now and people lose why LN (or other layers) are absolutely vital in bitcoin's evolution. 
If Bitcoin just made bigger blocks but someone say made LN on litecoin you'd quickly see bitcoin's value plummet as litecoin went sky high as adoption migrated.  
This is just natural evolution of cryptocurrency space.

You're asking for a full overview, might be best to check out some youtube videos of people setting up wallets and it'll be clearer.
Regarding the new jargon, here's a quick list that may help.
Private key - This is just a big number... like really big (200 digit long sort of big).  It's a random number you can make up or roll dice to generate or let a bit of software pick you a random one.
Seed - This too is just a number but is usually expressed as a list of 12 or 24 words.  With a seed you can generate many many private key numbers easily.  The purpose is you only need to remember one 'seed' and it generates all your bitcoin private keys so it makes it super easy to access your bitcoin from any computer anywhere in the world.
Bitcoin Wallet -  This doesn't store your bitcoin as most think.  It simply holds your private keys (or seed).  This means you can safely delete these wallets entirely yet still have access to your funds if you have written down/memorised your seed.
Blockchain - This is the list of every transaction that has ever happened and identical copies are stored on every computer who runs a 'full node' of bitcoin.
Full Node - This is typically the "bitcoind" software you can download and run on your PC.  It takes around 1Tb of HD space so not something for your mobile phone.
Basically just install a wallet like 'Electrum' or MyCelium on your PC or mobile phone (you can use this magic link [ to determine the easiest starting wallet) and get used to deleting the app and restoring it, put some funds on it and have fun spending some.  
It's not anywhere near as complicated as people make out when you start using it, it's just new jargon and doesn't require trusting any bank or payment company while allowing really secure payments online.

Although I should say receiving money twice at the same address is perfectly fine and secure
It is when **spending** money twice from the same address that should be avoided.  When you spend funds at an address you publish the public key so it weakens the security slightly, still totally secure these days but why risk it.

you can use bitaddress.org offline to check a private key converts to the address you expect.
That all said, I don't recommend putting all your eggs in one basket... i also no longer recommend paper wallets/single private keys.  They're great for long term storage but later you need to spend ALL the funds and is stressful situation.  If you're putting more than $500 aside don't mess around, buy a hardware wallet so you can sleep well at night knowing some keylogger isn't going to nab your funds later.  You can spend the private key offline but this is not trivial, I'd at least rehearse that process if you are set on using paper wallets.

It is still very early, until you hear banks advertising they accept crypto deposits it has a long way ahead.
Bitcoin is still the leading crypto in terms of future value and in the long run it will be worth 0 or vastly more than it is now, it wont remain at $6k is the only certainty because it is still so early.
Until something even better comes along Id say you’re doing a great thing getting involved now to learn how it works, just be open to change.

Yes, there is a high tx cost to get on/off the LN network.  That said once LN exists there will be an incentive by the miners AND network supporters to do a moderate blocksize increase at this point to keep fees to a reasonable amount.  E.g. $0.50 to get on/off seems reasonable to me but time will tell.

Do you have an example, I've never heard of an output going to multiple addresses like how you're describing.  
Are you sure you don't just mean a multisig address/P2SH style transaction where you can use multiple keys to spend it?
If that's the case it's merely the first transaction that uses this output as it's input gets to move the funds.  It doesn't duplicate them or anything crazy like that ;)
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:11:40
Awesome project!, Perhaps you'd like to share it on as this looks an interesting project I expect others would like to follow.
Btw, it would be helpful if there was some analytics done on highlighting the messages.  E.g. 
This isn't a transfer of  $97,271,092 but more likely a transfer of $14,895 with change of $97m.
So the super simple approach is the smaller output is the intentional amount being transacted so the original input balance should be ignored.  
The more advanced accurate approach is to take all the inputs and the smallest output that is greater than the largest input used.  This is because wallets will tend to minimise inputs but will consolidate inputs when needed because the intention is to transfer a certain amount.

I actually agree with the IMF here and think they are speaking wise words. Launching a coin for your own country is never going to end well.  This should be obvious but if it isn't they should see the failed attempts of the past (Iceland, Scotland, Venezulas to name a few).  
There's a very good reason why Bitcoin has no central issuer and why it wasn't shut down.  
If they are going to consider the crypto adoption route, do it slowly and just use the strongest global one which is Bitcoin by a vast order of magnitude.

You can do it with pencil and paper if you really wanted to, you don't need to be online or even on a computer to calculate an address from a random private key number you pick.
Easier to use open source software though... look at [coinb.in]( with  (Custom Seed)  and you can generate them there or [bitaddress.org](
Both can be run offline and you can verify/enter your own random private key in either to make sure they aren't faking the returned value ;)

The entire articles is focusing on negative points?? It's as bad as those articles focusing only on the good points, what happened to impartial factual articles?
A few points I feel obliged to highlight as misinformed.
* If the 51% happens.  This HAS happened and game theory again showed it wasn't that dangerous after all since miners want bitcoin to succeed.  Worst case scenario, if a malicious miner did come along we have the community simply adopt a new hashing system and life goes on... it's incredibly unlikely to be needed though because smart adversary's who might be able to do this know it's a pointless attack vector now.  Making an ASIC is no small feat, vastly improving over existing ASICs is well nothing more than magic and even QCs won't improve this.  There will no doubt be improved efficiency but we are very unlikely to see another order of magnitude jump, especially in a way that doesn't allow for competition.
* Saying bitcoin isn't a suitable store of value is daft.  Anything new takes time to settle, comparing an unknown technology like bitcoin compared to the most referenced fiat that has vast numbers and established for 50+ years isn't an oranges with oranges comparison, it's disingenuous to readers to even suggest this is a fundamental issue with bitcoin.  Comparisons based on considering the exchange rate from a week to week approach or even month by month is daft for a technology that needs to bootstrap value to itself is never going to be a smooth adoption.  Year on year bitcoin's value vastly increases simply because more people become aware of it and the herd FOMO psychology will give boom/bust cycles as adoption continues to increase precisely as designed from the outset.

What would you like it to do?  
I like this idea too since there are companies offering this as a paid service, I would like it that anyone had the ability to do what the companies are trying to do.
To start brain storming a few things an open source project might be able to do...
* Tag when funds sent to an address have come from a tx that had a much larger balance, i.e. this is likely a payment rather than change.
* Allow people to tag addresses (or submit xpub keys for exchanges) so it's easy to identify when funds have moved via an exchange.
* Suggest which wallet made the tx based on the fees calculated.  
* Highlight the timezone the chain of txs happened in to increase likelyhood they are by the same person
* Highlight when multipayout happens (&gt; 2 outputs) indicating mixing or a custom wallet
* Tag intervals between txs, this may help spot mixer bots.
* Highlight when OP\_RETURN data exists.
* Highlight non-standard, multisig, and segwit txs when known.
* Perhaps allow people to tag tx's with comments such as 'This trade was made on local bitcoin with xyz' signed by ABC.
* Order on a timeline to pan back and forth in time.
* Allow people to be tagged to be notified when funds move.
Perhaps brainstorm further on for more technically focused discussions.

What happens if they revert it after the payment goes through?  Is there any way to protect from chargebacks with UK transfers?
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:25:53
Lightning network won't fix this, you have to pay the fees on and off the LN channel so this is no different to a regular consolidation transaction.
You can put in your transaction to collate all your dust with a very low mining fee, to your new address and just sit it out...  it may take weeks and may have to rebroadcast it a few times but when the network quietens down someone will probably pick it up to clear the backlog especially if you've put some sort of reasonable fee in there ($2?)
If however it's lots of amounts of 0.0000001 btc you'll probably never be able to move those... at least not until there is no backlog.

If you sent the money it will either remain because the transaction was rejected (unlikely)  or will eventually go through.  There is a lot of congestion on the network so is probably just held in the backlog of transactions to process.

Not sure how nano does it but selecting legacy or segwit option is probably the same as Trezor.. totally safe either way just the segwit is the new way of doing BTC transactions that take less core space and therefore cost less in fees to include in the blockchain.  They will be treated as two separate wallets but easy to swap between them.  It certainly will never erase old funds if that's what you're concerned about.
Seems coinbase is just slow today so give it a few hours for them to catchup.

People can go short on 100 billion if there is 100 billion going long, maybe not from the start but in time as the futures become better known it can.
If an entity wanted to manipulate the market they can buy a shed load of actual bitcoin before the launch (or at arms length) so they can influence the market.  It would be daft to do this early on since it’s likely a cashcow for the future but should prices level off we can bet some are going to be tempted to do this.
The fact the price has been rallying so quickly makes me suspect there are a few players doing this... it’s not like they wake up one day with billions to randomly invest in this new crypto thing they just heard about.

I don't see how bitcoin has a fee market at moment, the min fee is artificially calculated to prevent spam... It's not a market supply/demand scenario currently.

I know precisely how much I own the finite resource compared to the world.  I also have a gauge on how many people are adopting it meaning there are more people who understand how to trade with it so demand increases meaning value increases.
Finally I can see the leading crypto, currently bitcoin, has a vast market ahead of it that is not tapped into yet.  The concept that we must use 3rd party profit making companies to facilitate trades in society is clearly unsustainable and in time will be replaced.  Nothing else solves it better than bitcoin at the moment.
So to answer your question about store of value, it's because I know how little I own and the value comes from others knowing this fact too.

You need to actually own/control the bitcoin to receive any benefits of a fork (or have a very kind wallet that gives you access but don't count on it!).
If you store your funds on an exchange or online wallet you probably won't get access to any new fork coins.

So much disinformation going on here!  Your funds are secure, spendable and can receive funds now and also if a hard fork happens. (Your funds would be in both forks, any new transactions would spread in both forks just like it does now)
There are small risks for a hard fork if it lasts more than 100 blocks... e.g. if you receive money from a miner (incredibly unlikely), or someone maliciously tries to double spend a payment to you during a hard fork.
Typically all these risks are for exchanges or merchants if they were unaware if they are on the most powerful blockchain (Yes, they'd know!).
Hard forks are not magical things, they are part of the bitcoin design and we've had them before... they're nothing to worry about.

It probably means import of that wallet type.  For instance if the import option you're talking about is on the breadwallet it means it will import a seed value and derive the addresses using the bread paths.
Basically sending the money via a transfer is vastly more secure too.  For instance you now have your eggs in two baskets rather than all your eggs in one basket which is half made of Bread and the other made of Electrum.  If either fail you lose all your eggs.  If you send half at least the most you can ever lose is half... for the sake of $1 fee it seems a pretty wise choice?

If you do think you happened to have any btc earlier make sure you copy that wallet.dat file, keep the original machine offline and run the bitcoind client on a brand new cleanly installed machine.  Copy your wallet.dat file to the new machine and check if it has any balance there.
There is no doubt a lot of malware looking for that specific file, if you've had your machine online for a long time you need to assume it's infected.  I know it's paranoia and probably unnecessary but if you got in when it was $28 per coin you could be talking about serious money here so worth a bit of tin foil hat approach in being careful.

The 1Mb block is there just to give the impetus to create a scaleable solution to allow bitcoin to go global.  Without this pressure we'd keep adding bigger blocks until the infrastucture is so large it becomes unfathomable to run an home and loses it's USP.  Bigger blocks would continue until even these vast infrastructure entities couldn't cope by scaling with larger HDs and faster CPUs at which point only the big companies would have an interest in solving the layer2 problem and that's trivial to do if you control the network. (It's how banks do it currently).
The increase has not been done so far because we need to ensure Bitcoin remains accessible to everyone.  Sadly this means as bitcoin has become more valuable the onchain transactions are more valuable so buying a coffee is no longer sensible and linear growth shows this should be expected.  I.e. a new coin could never represent a $1billion dollar transfer because it takes a lot of time and understanding before the coin's valuation is capable of representing this value.  Now Bitcoin can safely represent $1B transfers we need to find sensible ways to allow bitcoin to also cope with micro transactions for those coffees in a non-linear way.
Once LN (or whatever else comes along) is shown it can safely scale bitcoin to vast numbers, moderately increasing the blocksize to say 8Mb is a no-brainer for everyone if it is needed to reach everyone on the world... right now simple block size increases will certainly never reach everyone is the key point.

Bitcoin is good money, its not stocks though. To buy and sell it over a period of a year or two is no different than gambling or fx trading. 
To own and hold some should be if you believe it will be useful in future and until something even better comes along its the most secure money around imho.

You shouldn't send funds back to an address you've used before since when you publish the tx it also publishes the public key.  Should ECDSA ever become compromised it becomes easy for someone to just take your funds (Yes as far as we know right now ECDSA is still very safe but who knows what's around the corner)
Doing tx's manually this way is a bit of a PITA, I'd recommend getting a hardware wallet that handles the signing and keeping your private keys secure.  If you've got more than $500 worth of btc being protected I'd highlighly recommend biting the bullet and just buying a hardware wallet.

In theory, if your QC is fast enough to derive the private key from the public key found in a pending transaction before it is included in the block (and replace by fee is accepted by the miner who finds the next block), yes you can spend all the funds from that source address.
There are however four(edit: sorry I couldn't count) significant issues preventing this.
1. I'd expect a quantum computer that is only 100,000,000 times faster than a conventional computer is still not fast enough to do this in 10 minutes...  
2. Apparently the DWave machine is not a full QC so can't be put to use on arbitrary problems like this... I'm not sure about that and may be urban myths as I've never used it myself but repeatin hearsay.
3. You'd have to do it in an unnoticeable way so people didn't cotton on to what you're doing.  If it became obvious that EC was broken a new QC resistant signature system would be added to bitcoin to allow people to move funds relatively safely.  Only addresses that had been reused would be immediately at risk.
4. Replace by fee would likely be halted until most of the network is using the new signature system to prevent this attack from happening.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:47:02
Really well done and reasonably accurate explanation(Yes the longest chain bit is misleading as it's the most proof of work done but that's really hard to explain in an intro vid).  I think the jump from nodes to miners could be made clearer in that nodes may or may not decide to be miners and could touch on the difficulties ahead such as why layer2 developments are happening and tax/banking issues people encounter but 24mins is long enough and this gives a brilliant introduction of why bitcoin inevitably came to exist and why a bunch of numbers has any value.

Quantum computers do nothing to improve hashing speeds like SHA operations (actually they're incredibly bad for this).
So mining is unaffected.
When transactions are made, the typical transaction pays funds to an address which is a hash of the public key so again hardened to Quantum computers already.
Only when the funds are spent is the public key made visible.  At this point the funds in that address can now be made susceptiable to theft until they are confirmed as moved to a new address in the next mined block.
This is why address reuse is frowned up going forward.
That said it only leaves a window of opportunity until the miners include the new transaction in the next block which is typically 10 minutes.
Now all the computing power on the planet focused on one public key in bitcoin will not derive the private key in millions of years of solid work.
Quantum computers and faster algorithms will dramatically reduce this but we're still talking vastly longer than 10 minutes here from what I understand.  I.e. we're still safe as long as you don't leave funds in an address you reuse.
If however the public key-&gt;private key is cracked a new signature system could be added to bitcoin unless someone finds a way to solve it within the 10 minutes in a cost effective way.  
I'm sure there's more to it but generally it seems pretty safe for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:57:40
Yes, I'd expect so... just like sending your funds to a bitcoin eater address or accidentally gifting your entire balance to a miner.  That's the beauty of the raw blockchain... no undo, ever.

Actually to add to this, I'm currently a fan of exponentially increasing transaction fees based on how full a block is whilst we have block limits in place.  This would make such an attack incredibly expensive, probably prohibitively expensive and would bring the natural market dynamic of supply/demand such that miners make more money the busier the blockchain becomes and more of an incentive to make lightning network and other free systems as a layer built on the solid bitcoin layer to appear.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:10:15
If you imagine bitcoin transactions are identical to gold nuggets and the value of the transactions being the weight of the nugget it makes more sense.
When you 'spend' bitcoin, you collect together your nuggets you're about to spend, melt them into a new nugget(s) to send out.
The size of transaction is equal to the number of nuggets in AND out, it has nothing to do with the weight (i.e. bitcoin value) of those nuggets.

You're right but If the pool operators migrated to a branch that eventually allowed bigger blocks like xt it would allow it for all. The main line would most likely follow suite otherwise the main github repository would become useless.
The miners need to choose and I believe they're in the 'it ain't broke' mindset so we can see what does happen when blocks are consistently full.
Either way bitcoin should still flourish IMHO and we probably need to know how the network will work when consistently saturated.

So if you have an opinion consider supporting them in fixing any issues rather than trying to fuel a crusade that helps no one except their competitors.
The only reason their issues are highlighted is because so many people use the wallet or their free API. If anything these issues just highlight they need more developers/community support.

Whilst mining is technically possible it's very inefficient and slow way of obtaining bitcoin... I'd only recommend that if capital controls existed and had not other option but convert electricity to bitcoin.
At the moment they are in the euro so they can send these easily to exchanges like bitstamp/kraken I believe.
Once the bank transfer is completed the bitcoin is now instantly available to the individual to do with as they please (once they withdraw it to their own wallet, not the exchanges)
If I lived in Greece I'd be sending half my euro savings over to these exchanges just in case capital controls come into play due to a default or the potential for an grexit... if they exit the euro or have controls put in place they now have the option of purchasing bitcoin if they ever need to trade outside of Greece or easily move their value into USD, YEN, GBP, RBL, XAU or anything else if the euro starts losing value. 
Leaving savings in fiat in a time like this just seems incredibly risky but I guess most of us have never needed to consider alternatives before and bitcoin is unheard of for most people... I'll be amazed if anyone in Greece takes Bitcoin seriously at this stage but those that have researched it will probably be in a better place than the rest.

If you're using it as collateral, yes an escrow seems a sensible approach.
Do not ever give out your private key to someone to prove ownership.  Anyone with the private key has access to your funds at anytime from any computer now and in the future.  If you're ever giving money to someone else always do it via a transfer :)

@_date: 2015-06-12 12:12:04
Reusing addresses is bad because you've exposed your public key of that address by spending it.  It's now theoretically possible to deduce the private key from this public key... in practice no one really knows how to do this in a reasonable amount of time but it is possible... in many years to come it will become a risk, right now it's safe.
Regarding returning funds to the same address, that's ok if you own the address but if you say paid from an exchange you don't actually control that address. It's an oddity but these fringe cases do exist so need to be careful... always best a refund address is supplied at the time of purchasing things for bitcoin.  Asking for a refund address after the sale is a security risk as what happens if someone cancels your order and now takes your bitcoin as well?

Voting is essentially done by who owns the hashing power...  The powerhouse in China understandably don't want to change the bitcoin rules to their detriment... if a way could be found to reassure them they'd easily cope with larger blocks I expect the transition could be done quickly.
1Mb is so arbitrary it's frustrating this has come up but I guess it's better now than in a few years time when more is at stake.
My hunch is this is another experiment we should go through to see what happens when transaction fees rise quickly.  It will generate innovation and an understanding of what a full system is still capable of.  If it starts losing users we can be pretty confident these large mining pools will quickly change their mind as they don't want bitcoin to lose value either...  We're in the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" stage.

Looks like they will require people to have a license to buy or sell bitcoin for USD (still short sighted IMHO) but bitcoin is still very much allowed there... actually could be said they're endorsing it making it more legitimate because businesses will need to be officially recognised.
Very surprised they don't have a turnover threshold however, seems rather stifling for the potential of any startups there.  Sucks to live in New Hampshire if you're a developer, best to move to California :)

Have you considered an HD wallet like electrum or mycelium? You therefore only need the 12 words to be written down and can monitor your addresses without exposing your private keys or reusing them.
Also you can spend the funds anywhere on any computer if you memorise the words.

Youre missing the point.  You can have 2 keys to access your account (look at BitGo for a consumer version).  This means even if your key was compromised you'd still be able to block any payments.

Forgive any hostility others may send, many people are welcoming of such questions where people just want to learn.
I too was dismissive of bitcoin when I first saw it, luckily (I think) I had a bit of time to really get into it so gave it longer than I would most new tech and pleasantly surprised.  Actually it got me as excited as seeing the first 3dfx card and the first iPhone... Both having a big impact on my career choices.
My logic is inevitably someone will find a way of making free payments between people outside of national currencies, making corporate payment providers an unnecessary burden while opening new markets for anything financially operated. Before that is possible we need a way of representing real value digitally in a standard format, bitcoin clearly succeeds at this and the constant growing transaction rate shows this isn't a fad.
Having a token of value not owned or controlled by anyone else now enables the layers on top to achieve this frictionless payment system IMHO. 
There's so much more but that's one reason I'm excited about it.

Others have answered most of the questions so won't reiterate them however I need to point out  is rather misleading.
A transaction fee on bitcoin network is no where near that expensive, it may have blipped at that price at one moment in time for guaranteed next block delivery but that was far from the norm.  
The fee for a lightning tx is almost free.  I say almost free because people will try to charge however the game dynamic changes in that it's a race to the bottom where the most a node can charge is below average fee price to gain the traffic.

How do the economics of this work?  If it's centralised the mining AND development must be subsidised by the private entities.  
Their ledger is only as trust worthy as the company who's running it since they control the mining and verification process.  If they open the mining up to the world they become open to competition and losing control of the system so unlikely to happen.  
What happens if that private company ups it's fees for using their chain, disappears, attacked, has state involvement or they can't scale or maintain it?
There are hundreds if not thousands of eager developers refining and building on a global bitcoin, why on earth would they jump ship to pay a private company for what they already get for free.  
Bitcoin works because it's trustless...
Sorry if this comes across as a bit harsh but people seem to get wrapped up in this blockchain thing forgetting the key point that it only has security because bitcoin has tangible value... take away that value and you're left with a generic database like any other.

Yes you're totally able to do that, and other bitcoin branches have done exactly this I believe but can't be discussed in this subreddit.
The problem is it's the miners that need to change to support larger blocks as they're the ones making the blocks.  
Only when &gt;50% of the miners changed to support &gt;1Mb blocks will larger blocks be possible.  The issue is a single change isn't really going to solve the bigger issue, i.e. we need an algorithmic approach (e.g. doubling every 4 years) rather than a single change.
At some point bitcoin blocks will become full and increasing the size is simply not an option... we therefore need ways to scale bitcoin other than just increasing this blocksize number.  Until there is pressure to find these additional layers on bitcoin these new layers simply won't happen until it's absolutely critical.
If blocks max out now we will understand how a fee market operates and if it's good or bad for bitcoin with the option of solving it overnight if necessary.
I'm therefore on the side that we should have some pain now in it's early years instead of in 10 years time when it's maxing out at 100+Mb blocks and there is a lot more riding on bitcoin functioning flawlessly and urgently need an option other than increasing block size.
It is a storm in a teacup at the moment though, if a fee market does become harmful to bitcoin the block size will be increased very quickly.

It gets to a point where factors make it impossible to.
E.g. bandwidth constraints, propagation time per block opens malicious mining attacks/more orphaned blocks, HD space isn't scaling at a n^2 rate, performance of verifying blocks and a few fundamental code issues requiring refactoring to grow to vast sizes it eventually needs.

I any respectable half decent programmer charges at least 1btc per day for a project like this... If they're capable of writing bitcoin code probably more but you might get lucky as is worldwide.
If it's 0 funds upfront this 1btc per day should count directly as equity in the company (not share options).
The company valuation at this stage is purely days invested in the idea design/research... Ie programming share can quickly become majority ownership without payment/investment which becomes difficult for all.
If you're offering payment instead of equity it's best to call it out to reach the right audience.

Simple short answer:
It's the biggest number that fits a 64bit floating point number without loss of precision (Check out the mantissa in wikipedia for detail) .  Technically can go 2x higher but probably selected more because it is the largest number that crops up when using 50, 25, 12.5, halving plus gives some room to prevent overflow issues.

Depends on the wallet but essentially all it is doing is remembering a single number and is saved as a file such as wallet.dat.
There are two types of wallets, ones where you have lots of private keys or one where you have one seed number that all private keys are made from.
The latter HD wallet is the easiest way to use bitcoin these days.  The HD wallet has a seed number which is normally expressed as 12 words so it's easy for humans to remember this seed and have access to their money on any computer anywhere in the world.
The bitcoins (well balances stored in addresses) themselves are stored in the global giant database called the blockchain.  You can download the blockchain onto your computer but normally most people use light weight wallets that just connect to a computer that has a copy of the blockchain.

I'm genuinely wanting to know why a fee market is bad but afraid I can't agree with this post.
Markets are established when a finite resource exists with demand.
If blocks fill up fees will increase until demand drops to match and an equilibrium is reached. The fees set at the moment are artifical.
Yes block size should eventually be increased but at some large size it can't. The blocks will grow at least at a time ^ k rate that exceeds technology rate. Unless we solve constraints of the Internet we should start now to develop ways to allow bitcoin to scale to the size for mass adoption... Blocksize is not the scalable answer and needs this pressure to innovate now.
Think global warming and allowing more oil to be used ;)
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:47:45
Actually to add to this, I'm currently a fan of exponentially increasing transaction fees based on how full a block is whilst we have block limits in place.  This would make such an attack incredibly expensive, probably prohibitively expensive and would bring the natural market dynamic of supply/demand such that miners make more money the busier the blockchain becomes and more of an incentive to make lightning network and other free systems as a layer built on the solid bitcoin layer to appear.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:37:41
If you're afraid of this evolution you're experiencing the same disbelief most sane people face when they hear bitcoin vs fiat argument.  Ie a fiat worked in the past and will continue to work, why innovate on it?
Main issue is its not broken at the moment so don't fix it.
Keep in mind however that bitcoin can never scale to handle 100Gb blocks in a decentralised way, it simply can't handle everything people need in an unlimited way. 
This is not a flaw, merely a technical constraint just like all computer protocols have.
 I was originally against keeping at 1mb but recently changed my mind, putting a small squeeze on now pushes the new layers on top of bitcoin to be made sooner with less at stake.  If more time is needed and users leave btc because of high fees, the limit can still be safely raised but at least the ball is rolling before its boom or bust when that option is not possible.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:51:39
I should add, before the transaction is part of the block can be detected by anyone so bitcoin transactions are near instant but to be certain the funds have been transferred this is why you wait until the transaction was included in the block.  Banks do this clearing every 24 hours, bitcoin does it every 10 minutes.

Remember if the value was 'steady' we should see btc prices drop by 11% this year due to the 3600 BTC per day being added to the ecosystem.  Next year this drops to 1800BTC so should only see a 4% inflation rate.
Who knows the price in 5 years but my hunch is it'll either be almost $0 or in excess of $10,000 per btc, almost no chance it's going to hover at $220 as there is no obvious market incentive for this to happen.

Miners fee of 0.0001 BTC per transaction.  Say 7 tps for good measure, that's 60BTC per day = ~$230/BTC = ~$14,000 per day.
Obviously if this was sustained from a few IPs they could be isolated within a few days for the first node encountering it and perhaps hours for subsequent nodes retargetted.  At this point you'd need a botnet or other multiple IP address system which would have it's own overheads in fees.  Also more mitigation strategies could be easily added such as
A given IP can only relay say 100 tiny transactions a minute as a very simple example.  This way the network would still accept a good portion of these transactions taking the attackers money whilst still allowing normal operation.
So overall, yes it would be possible to blip the system for a few days with such a technique but probably a waste of money given it could be adapted easily and shouldn't do any long term damage.
That said there might be an incentive to play the market with scaring everyone by clogging it up... wouldn't be pleasant but I guess it would be preferable to happen now before another adoption wave.  One caveat is the exchanges may temporarily close during such an attack since they wouldn't be able to put through their withdrawal and deposit orders.

When hardforks happened in the past I don't think it made much of a price, saying that as a feeling rather than analytical data but the last hard fork the price didn't even register in my mind as it all got resolved so quickly.
*IF* a major hard fork pops up because of the 20Mb block size change for instance I'd expect it to be resolved within a few hours since no miners want to be mining the fork that will eventually lose.
You can be pretty sure the mining pools will have a gameplan to avoid a hard fork since they have time to consider and prepare for it.  The last hard fork was not planned for or anticipated yet still resolved very quickly.
So yes I expect they'll be some price play on the scaremongering but unless there is a fundamental flaw which would somehow miraculously prevent a rollback or mass consensus of an update it's unlikely to make any difference in the long run in my opinion... All seems like a mountain over a mole hill so far.
@_date: 2015-12-07 11:58:09
Not roadblocks but a few hurdles to be overcome I'm watching for...
* Scalability.  Currently bitcoin network is very linear which prevents pushing mainstream adoption yet.  The current system is great for large sums settlement or small volume transactions but for every day usage by everyone it has a lot to do.  Sidechains, lightning network, tree chains are 3 of the leading candidates to solve this but there are likely others coming too.  This will just take development work/time/best of breed to establish the sensible way to grow.  It will inevitably happen UNLESS a competing alt coin appears that addresses this from the outset and gains traction.  Sidechains make it far more likely to be bitcoin based otherwise the alt coin will have to overcome the technical hurdle, bootstrap value somehow AND get awareness/adoption.  With a side chain they only need to overcome the technical hurdle as the value and awareness of bitcoin already exist.  Equally if an alt were to make it successfully someone will easily be able to make a sidechain from it to eclipse the new alt.
* Legal.  Many banks will (and already do) try to lobby, discredit and vilify bitcoin so they can delay the pending "uber bank" moment people are talking of.  If they lobby for laws to outlaw it this may buy them time to introduce their own chain they control which may save the big ones from suddenly losing market share to some laughably small startup.  
* Forex adoption.  Bitcoin eventually needs to be accepted by forex institutions for it to be taken as credible by many, i.e. treated like a global currency as well as a commodity.  It would allow controlled on/off ramps for countries and most importantly improve liquidity.  Until the scalability is resolved though it's probably not worth chasing this just yet.

It's because the propagation time slows the larger the block I believe so someone is gaming the system by not including transactions to give a marginal improved chance their block will be picked over another.
If it's a pool people contribute to they should change their miners to a more ethical pool from these parasites who aren't actually helping the system... my hunch is it's an industrial farm not realizing they're hurting the economy by doing this selfish trick since it prolongs confirmation times (on average) by the % of the network power they control.
A block must contain X transactions to be considered valid.  X = ( average number of transactions over last week ) / 10
or perhaps more effectively...
Any node that tries to propagate a valid 0 transaction block gets their connection dropped and IP blocked thereby excluding their blocks from replicating through the network since they wouldn't be able to connect to the network after too many of these shitty blocks.
This change could easily be made whilst the mining pool owns less than 50% of the power.

It's probably accurate for 95% of the people who talk about "blockchain but not bitcoin" rubbish.  They want to separate themselves from the small nefarious uses bitcoin has been associated with but get the concept this invention is here to stay.  Eventually they'll come to understand blockchains better and realise the most powerful chain is the only viable chain to support which currently Bitcoin is a vast order of magnitude stronger than anything else... hence why alt coins that are replicas never gain significant traction and typically fizzle out.
Engineers mentioning blockchains however may be talking about the actual db technology, i.e. P.O.W. to enhance historical data integrity but that is likely a private network in a very specialised case.   In comparison terms it would be vastly less secure than tagging in bitcoin's blockchain so probably not as compelling as historical proof when compared to the public global chain like Bitcoin which is provably agnostic to the data in there.  Perhaps in time as understanding grows data contained in the blockchain will be trusted by courts of law given it can't be faked, would certainly make patent, land registry, asset ownership, contract existence and document validity far more robust than current systems.
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:56:33
I could be wrong but I believe it requires code changes if ever applied to bitcoin as it tampers with the transaction amount values (i.e. I'd be shocked if adopted in bitcoin itself) however it has been implemented by default in the new two way pegged SideChain also announced today... Elements.
I.e. this system is not just theory but actually working (albeit only running on testnet at the moment) so if the sidechain works well it this will enable incredibly fast development of new technologies like this all backed by bitcoin.
I've only just read it so forgive me if I've misunderstood it so far but that's the impression I've got.

At the moment people are still learning best ways of handling it and many are overly cautious.
Digital downloads linked to an account where a double spend can have a repercussion should allow 0 confirmations since it's no different than trusting a bank will honour payment and unlikely to happen. 1+ confirmations is only needed when an incentive to double spend exists. Eg shipping physical product or high value item transactions.
In time this will be less important as layers are built on top (think greenaddress.it )
but right now people do have tools to double spend 0 confirmation transactions, and whilst they rarely work the slim chance it could does mean many just want simplicity in guaranteeing payment over user experience.

Don't get me wrong, bitcoin has it's fair share of problems but apart from vast scalability most are not at the protocol level.
Gaining any users during a phase whilst the technology is a massive learning exercise for all and be a pain in the ass to use is incredible (I mean seriously, sending addresses via QR codes would never allow mainstream adoption). 
Right now the friction of using bitcoin (wallet usability + on/off fiat ramps) make it difficult for non technical people to see the advantage but all of these will get addressed as the foundation is solid... that's almost a certainty because there is a global demand to improve this.  If these on/off ramps were trivial it would have sky rocketed a couple years ago (and collapsed even harder as new issues were encountered so early on)
What is questionable is if a bank thinks they can usurp it by giving out a free public system that is technically more advanced, easier to use, free of fees and addresses the new issues currently being resolved in btc... they might achieve this but I'd be incredibly surprised as they seem to still only be getting excited about the blockchain idea instead of the implications for using this technology such as privacy concerns, micropayments, key safety, contracts and preserving value.
I'm sure we'll see more private chains popping up but speaking for myself these corporate chains hold as much interest as much as QQ points, Linden dollars, WoW, beanz or any other disastrous virtual currency.  All of these systems failed adoption because it's got a single point of failure where an external influence can make their value worthless overnight.  The fact it's built with a blockchain database doesn't change the fact these are flawed models that will never work for a currency especially now feasible alternative(s) exist.
Whether Bitcoin is that long term feasible alternative is certainly debatable but right now it's the leading candidate...

If adding more than 21m coins was agreed by the mining pools and payment portals there's nothing we as individuals can do about it, equally an individual can't increase it either... group consensus sees us through selfish decisions like this so we can be confident (at least while significant block rewards exist) that this number will not increase.  (There is also a good technical reason why 21m is the limit but that's beside the point)
The 1Mb blocksize is not a question of 'should we keep it because that's the way it is' but more a question of 'will increasing it break things?'.  There should be no limit at all but I guess it's a safety precaution as throwing 10Gb blocks into the mix right now is bound to cause havok with a system that wasn't gradually ramped up to that figure.
If you can prove to me that 20Mb blocks are dangerous at the moment or will break the system in some way I'd fully support you and your 1Mb suggestion , otherwise I opt for evolution of the system and allow the 20Mb.
This really does feel like a mountain out of a mole hill, next week I expect it'll be water under the bridge as miners simply update and support the 20Mb blocks.
**(I assume Mike H will be adding code in that states 20Mb blocks won't be allowed until block X where X is some date like ~September 2015).  This way miners can upgrade now without fear of a branch, check what other miners are using in August 2015 and remain on the 20Mb branch if enough mining pools are using BitcoinXT 11 or whatever it'll be called)** (Edit 2016-&gt;2015 as I'm from the future apparently)

This is precisely what signing does and most wallets let you type in a message, hash the message into a single number (X) and produce a signature number (Y) from your private key (d).
Signing takes a number (X) and with your private key(d) can produce a signature number (Y).  Now with publishing your signature (Y) and your public key(P) anyone can decode (Y) with (P) to get back to (X).
This way you never need to show your private key (d) yet you've proved you have (d) as it's the only way that (Y) could be produced such that (Y) -&gt; (P) = (X).
(I'm oversimplifying it as signing also takes a random number to prevent people being able to undo your signing process but that's sort of irrelevant unless you want to fully understand the maths)

Paper wallets as a novelty gift or where a mini pub key is helpful or you plan on just putting a block of coins away for many many years to redeem all at once later.
Otherwise I'd look at Electrum or Mycelium where you get 12 words to memorise, write down, inscribe into a block of metal, etc... 
Because when you need to later retrieve the funds you can transfer as much or as little as you'd like without having to remake your offline storage again and you haven't compromised your account by reusing a public key.

Will let others add in more detail but a quick summary:
No idea what HSBC's stance is on bitcoin specifically, if you're doing large volumes of sales however you'll need a business account or there is a chance they may question your transactions.  Typically banks are hostile to bitcoin due to the risk they open themselves to and the misinformation out there... I'd be surprised if HSBC allowed a business account dealing in bitcoin but you never know!  
Regarding tax, bitcoin is nothing special in this regard.  If you buy/sell and make a significant profit (when exchanged to GBP), you have an obligation to report profits and pay any appropriate tax.  Typically low amounts less than £3000/year profit are tax free (check HMRC site for accurate details).  If you go over this amount you need to pay tax on the profits just like trading anything really.  
Bitcoin is perfectly legal to use in the UK just like all modern countries, the Bank of England has even given a very impressive comprehensive summary on it's advantages and risks of the emerging technology and the many positive aspects it brings to traditional banking... London appears to be one of the leading cities in this new bitcoin/blockchain era.
You can speak to HMRC directly if you want specific details on aspects but it is new so may get a few raised eyebrows merely because the majority of the public are unaware of it.  If you are planning on trading hundreds of thousands of pounds I'd recommend getting legal advice and written permission from your bank as ironically it's the 5 big banks that stifle UK companies from becoming significant players in the market at the moment.

Ripple had such amazing potential but it's a centralized IOU like any other virtual currency that existed before bitcoin so will fall foul of over regulation and finally corporate ownership if it does 'succeed'.

Depends on the wallet how important this is.
For HD wallets you typically have 12 words to remember, the only reason to back up your wallet from here is merely to have the meta data like who it was you paid rather than just a history of transaction values and dates.
For non-HD wallets like bitcoind however it's very important to backup regularly.  Typically a private key relates to a single address, this address should only be used once to send funds from as an enhanced security feature should ECDSA be broken in future.  Most wallets do this by default so you don't need to worry but what this means is every time a transaction is done the full amount at that address is transferred to at least two addresses (1 to who you're paying, and the other is your change address where any remaining funds from the original transaction are sent back to).
This change address uses a different private key from your source address.  Bitcoind wallet forinstance always generates 100 future addresses in the wallet for these change addresses, this typically means you can do up to 100 transactions and still restore from a backup and it'll magically still have access to all your bitcoin even at the new addresses that weren't there when you last made your backup.
If however you do 101 transactions with the bitcoind client and lose your wallet/restore that old backup... all the funds that were sent to the address in 101 will be lost forever as your backup has no knowledge of this 101st change address hence why backups are encouraged regularly.
Typically I think most people now use HD or multisig HD wallets now anyhow so isn't an issue but worth calling out if anyone is using bitcoind to store funds.

Don't fret too much over this... If you have two computers you can do this pretty safely AND use the internet to setup.
So basically setup both computers with the latest electrum client.  Now take one of these computers offline to never go online again.
On the online computer create a tx from your source address to the destination address.  No private key used!
Once you have generated this transaction (clicking Preview I think it is).  You can save this tx to a USB or simply keep it on screen.
On the offline computer you now import your private key to electrum.  Load/enter the tx displayed on your online computer.  Now you should be able to tap 'sign' and it will give you a valid tx.
Save this tx to the USB (or leave it onscreen to QR code scan it/type it).
Tap this into your online computer in something like coinb.in and you can verify the tx is indeed sending funds from your source address to the destination address with the correct mining fee.   If you're happy with it, just publish the tx by broadcasting it in coinb.in, blockchain.info, bitcoind or from electrum console.
That's it, your tx will be picked up and you've never had to enter your private key on a connected PC.
You should now have no funds remaining at the private key address anyhow so nothing more needs doing but you may like to blank the offline PC if you do have any funds potentially ever going back to that source address.

‘Loss of value is only relevant between assets, it does not apply to currencies’
Im not sure I follow, why does a currency need to be treated any differently than an asset? There is no fixed value to a currency, merely perception like any asset.  People have savings in currencies, these I expect people would like to be treated as a valuable asset to have.
If someone holds £100 today, and could buy £100 worth of sweets this year,  they could choose to hold that £100 note yet only afford to buy £96 worth of todays sweets the following year if all goes well... seems very much like people treat it as a depreciating asset.

This is why I'd like to consider, a kill switch on funds... Ie funds transferred from special addresses  contain a 'locked until block' approach so a transaction sent to another address can only be spent say after 12 blocks EXCEPT during that 12 blocks a new transaction can also be issued by the original owner destroying the coins from existence. 
Now even though whoever was robbed has lost the money, the thief doesnt have the money either. Such an approach would remove the incentive to steal in the first place.

This is just absurd, if 90% turned their machine off it simply means we get slow blocks for a while until the readjustment and then the remaining blocks operate as normal.
If the 90% come online at once the blocks get solved really quickly.

Only a malicious attack would do this and doesn't offer any long term damages for an attacker?

It's because every significant transaction needs to be monitored for fraud or laundering, usually your bank does this for you hence your account summary each month and you only had to show your ID once when opening your account.  Given bitcoin is like taking your cash out it needs to have the same 'know your customer' / 'anti money laundering' (KYC/AML) processes any other financial institution asks.
Coinbase appears reputable and established so if you're happy giving your ID over to banks/forex exchanges/etc.. you can put them in the same boat but you're right to question it to be safe.
If you do send in your ID, make sure you watermark/tag it so you know who to speak to if it is ever leaked as they should be securely encrypting your ID documents but history shows most institutions don't understand this... Given bitcoin's security ethos there's probably a better chance coinbase will look after your ID far safer than your bank does if that's of some reassurance.
If you want to buy some without having to produce ID Localbitcoins is a popular approach to do this but they'll charge a premium over say the exchange rates, MyCelium on android, bittylicious in UK, etc.. all of these allow direct person to person transactions for instance which are also allowed since there is still a digital trail of who bought what when recorded by the banks of buyer and/or seller.

It's basically just a global database that is indestructible and has a limited number of units.  'Ownership' of the units is by anyone or anything who has the password( i.e. private key number) to move them to someone else's address in that database.
It enables computers to have their own accounts, allows payments to be made without private banks being involved just like cash does but in a global sense.  It could also become the store of value outside of nations thereby becoming something like a global reserve currency.

Not quite, the goal is to do as many guesses as possible at as little cost as possible. 
Ie if you could make an infinite number of guesses at 0 cost is the pinical of mining. In practice it takes power (about 1watt per billion hashes is as efficient as it gets) plus maintenance and hw costs.  Many miners run at a loss expecting bitcoin to be worth more in future. 
Its a beautiful pure form of true economics in action. 
Keep in mind difficulty can increase and decrease based.  This happens to keep 1 block being found by one computer every 10 mins (which allows that miner to credit themselves new bitcoin up to the limit which is 12.5 currently). This difficulty is based on the average block rate over a 2 week period.  
These values are set in the algorithm from day one and is unlikely to ever be changed.

36 letters for the first character, 36 characters for second, 36 for third, ... 36 for the last (8th) character = 36 x 36 x 36 x 36 x 36 x 36 x 36 x 36  = 36 ^ 8 combinations.

in case it helps, bitcoin is inflationary, right now it's around 4% per year.
In 2021 it will change to be around 2% however.  2025 1%, etc...
so eventually the inflation rate disappears.
The thing is, bitcoin is not going to replace fiats IMHO, it can however allow people to side step from needing banks to interact between people and helps keep banks honest.
Would I still support bitcoin if the upper limit was increased?  Personally no, simply because the 21,000,000 number isn't some magical number, it's actually important from an engineering perspective.  It's close to the largest number that can be accurately stored down to the individual satoshi in floating point numbers like used in Javascript.  Going beyond this means you risk miscounting.
Also it is essentially normalised value on the internet.
If someone says they have 1,000,000 bitcoin, you know they have 5% of the world's value.  No if's, but's or maybe's.  You don't need inflation/deflation when you know what everything is relative to.

Miners fee of 0.0001 BTC per transaction.  Say 7 tps for good measure, that's 60BTC per day = ~$230/BTC = ~$14,000 per day.
Obviously if this was sustained from a few IPs they could be isolated within a few days for the first node encountering it and perhaps hours for subsequent nodes retargetted.  At this point you'd need a botnet or other multiple IP address system which would have it's own overheads in fees.  Also more mitigation strategies could be easily added such as
A given IP can only relay say 100 tiny transactions a minute as a very simple example.  This way the network would still accept a good portion of these transactions taking the attackers money whilst still allowing normal operation.
So overall, yes it would be possible to blip the system for a few days with such a technique but probably a waste of money given it could be adapted easily and shouldn't do any long term damage.
That said there might be an incentive to play the market with scaring everyone by clogging it up... wouldn't be pleasant but I guess it would be preferable to happen now before another adoption wave.  One caveat is the exchanges may temporarily close during such an attack since they wouldn't be able to put through their withdrawal and deposit orders.

Use cases:
It allows new digital currencies to pop up but their denomination is linked to bitcoin... i.e. the new coin doesn't need any adoption.  You transfer 1BTC from bitcoin's blockchain to 1BTC on another independent blockchain AND you can transfer that 1BTC back to the bitcoin blockchain... i.e. it's value is preserved.
Why does this matter?  Well you've probably been watching the fiasco people are making over this 1Mb-&gt;20Mb blocksize limit change... things like this can now be done really easily.  Someone can start bitcoin chain v2 which has 20Mb blocks in and people can migrate their coins over from bitcoin v1 to v2.  If they think 'this new chain is crap because it's slower or not enough wallets recognize it', they can move their coins back to V1.
This allows massive amounts of innovation and decentralised development to happen making Bitcoin the reserve currency of the internet.
It's early days to know if this is indeed going to work like everyone wants it to, it certainly will have teething problems but in theory they've achieved this amazing technical feat on top of another amazing technical feat.  The implications could be staggering...

Whilst doing the public key to private key in a quantum computer is theoretically (and probably already) possible it can't reverse the two types of hashes which need the be done to spend btc. 
Also if it was shown to be broken Bitcoin's encryption can be changed with a hard fork as a worst case scenario so new transactions use the different signature algorithm.
Any addresses which haven't had funds spent from would still be secure due to the hashing systems used.
Keep in mind if it were possible to use publically available computers to reverse keys https, chip and pin, your phone data and all app signing would be compromised too so would be headline news before Bitcoin was even considered :)

AES 256 bit encryption is secure IMHO, the password that generates the key used in the encryption seems rather weak... but there is a serious issue with Adobe encryption!
Due to the 'Protecting people' crypto laws, PDFs are also crippled just like DVDs and had to be limited to 40bits of encryption... i.e. only the first 5 bytes of the MD5 hash are used to encrypt the document.  
So with an 8 character high entropy password you'd get a key of...
8 characters generates around  64 characters (6 bits) for 8 =48 (typo) bits of entropy at most.   64 ^ 8 = 48 bits of entropy = 281,474,976,710,656 combinations.
If you could do 1,000,000 tests per second that's approximately ~3250 days... statistically it's half this so say 1600 days.  The key is not generated via iterations of hashing but merely a single hash so 1000000 per second is probably fairly conservative estimate.  I.e. it's somewhat secure but if you're planning on putting millions in there it's not ideal as it can certainly be broken.
HOWEVER I believe with a PDF you only get 
**40 bits of entropy**, i.e. ~400 days to crack it with a modest single PC today.  So a level of safety from casual hackers but certainly not safe if left in the wild.

They could ban port 8332/8333 to limit node connections in that country.  Clearly it's easy to migrate the protocol to another port or dynamically change so not worth the effort of trying that approach.
They could do deep packet inspection.  Again a VPN would get around this easily or simply use relay sites since you don't have to run a node to interact with the network.  Also if this were ever attempted packets could be encrypted easily enough so again it's not practical to even try this approach.
They could disconnect the country from the internet... sadly there are bitcoin satellites spinning over our heads, again this banning the internet wouldn't prevent people from doing it either.
They could tell people it's illegal to use... but that just prevents the legitimate benefits of it being utilised in that country while the rest of the world gains from the efficiencies it offers.
The could demonize it saying it's only for nefarious things to scare people from using it.  This seems to be the main approach taken but looks like that's failed too now people see it is actually useful.
So basically can they ban it?  Not really when it matters, they could ban it in countries that don't have anything to lose from people using it but what's the point.  The countries that are unstable may want to ban it to prevent capital flight but at that point people may not care if it's banned or not since their local money would be garbage to the rest of the world at that point anyhow.

Kudos for them giving this a try but they've not solved the main problem here...
What stops the distributor buying 0.001 BTC and sending it to private key 'A' that generates address 'B'.
Now simply copy and paste address 'B' on 1000 notes.  (Clearly it might be best to have more than 1x 0.0001btc to pull this scam off but none-the-less the point remains)
People using these notes therefore have to trust two things.
* The note printer hasn't duplicated any
* The note printer hasn't kept the private keys (or seed) somewhere that they can later just pull all the funds from those notes.
It can happen if the distributor is trustworthy or has years of history showing they are trustworthy but this will take a long time.
For that reason I only trust the Casascius coins since Mike has been in the crypto space from very early on and shown over the years he has been good to his word and not kept the private keys.

A pool fee of 0% is sadly attractive because until it's a problem why would anyone pay another pool even 0.1% if they get all of it from ghash?
The stupid thing about this setup is what ghash get out of this.  Extra customers?  They're dead weight/liability as not really earning ghash directly so the question is why are they doing this?
Is it govt infiltration?  Perhaps, let's face it, if a govt was trying to undermine (no pun intended) bitcoin this approach of operating 2 or 3 pools and PAYING miners an extra % to mine on it sounds pretty darn attractive!  Given how slowly things get signed off in govt's I'd be incredibly surprised they'd devote money to a speculative project on one speculative currently like this yet... There are also easier ways to undermine it all...
Is it ego driven?  Perhaps, but why go to all this effort and be able to maintain it at a loss?
 
Is it they earn some other way?   This is my hunch as I'm not sure what stops them stating a hash rate that is slightly higher than they actually have and taking that margin as the fee.  E.g. state the pool's speed is 10PH but actually it's 11PH, the pool contributors have no accurate way of knowing and GHash simply pocketing 10% of the earnings as looks like it's going to miners.
The fact GHash is rather secretive on their identity and not trying to prevent &gt; 33% ownership makes me think it's the later.

Good question, I've never looked into it in the past but here you go.
Here's the BTC that was 'burnt'.  2130BTC (Close to $1m at today's rate)
This created 2,647,061.08 XCP and no more will ever be created.
From blockchain it looks like around 2600 burns happened so that means there must be less than 2600 people who originally got involved in XCP and now it's starting to go through the roof due to yesterday's announcement so expect many will have made their bitcoin back already.
(Disclaimer I do own a very small number of XCP that I got through trading, not investing)

Redeeming a paper wallet can be done via blockchain.info or electrum.  It is also possible to do in Multibit and bitcoind but those are a pain in the a** to import keys with (especially encrypted keys).
A word of warning though, once you import funds via the private key move all your funds to a new address.  If you accidentally import that private key in multiple locations it causes an absolute mess.  (My personal experience of exporting a private key from blockchain.info and importing it to multibit... didn't lose any coins but blockchain believes I spend my entire balance anytime a send even 0.0001btc)

You don't I'm afraid, it's about creating a new address.

So every time anyone anywhere makes a transaction in bitcoin it's recorded and replicated across every 'full node' computer.  These are the computers where you can connect to any of them to send your bitcoin transactions.
Every once in a while (approximately every 10 minutes) one of these computers will be selected by random because they solved a problem that takes everyone working on the problem on average 10 minutes to solve.  This problem gets easier and harder depending on how many people are trying to solve it so someone is usually a winner every 10 minutes... think of it as solving a riddle like name 5 countries without an 'a' in it.
This takes time to work out but is instantly verifiable by anyone if it's right or wrong.
The computer that solves this riddle verifies all the transactions that have happened on the bitcoin network up to the point it solved the puzzle.  It stamps these to say they've been verified and here's the solution to the puzzle to prove they are the random winner.
Why do this??  Because it prevents the double spend problem.   By the system picking one of these computers (miners) at random they not only verify their new transactions but they also verify the transactions before it.  This prevents any person being able to game the system and accepting transactions which are invalid or more importantly double spending a transaction.
It's hard to do as ELI5 but in a nut shell a block is just a group of transactions with the riddle solution to prove it was independently verified and trustworthy.

Banking funds are protected from fraud, can be easily reversed and have alternative transfer systems like banking cards and cash.  Bitcoins you're on your own, if a new virus is out there and extracts your private key there is no help from that point on.

I mean the exchange price is irrelevant to people using the currency.  If $100 buys X btc, you know you can sell X btc for $100 with a small variance within a fee minutes (less exchange fees).  I.e. That transaction doesn't care about the exchange price  given it's buying/selling the same amount. Only if those btc were held by someone for any length of time before or after the transaction would it impact the exchange price.

I agree with you.  Bits is so overused already and even as a programmer I find bits confusing and isolating from currency.

A bit dollar is just 100 bit-cents like we usually do.

It's good considering ideas that help user experience like this but I think this one is flawed as others like luke mention.
The main issue is have is that having the R value reused is incredibly technical and shouldn't have happened just like Sony learnt.
Firstly when this happens in future people need the be technical enough to understand what happened to be able to sign that transaction you're talking of... The wallet provider can't do that as they shouldn't know your private keys to make your addresses otherwise it's an even bigger issue.
This would have been a painful lesson to learn but I think wallet providers are savvy to it now.

Just to highlight this is confirmation time, not transaction time.  It being 4 times faster may be useful for some purposes but I've yet to encounter when faster confirmations make any significant difference.
e.g. standing in front of an ATM for 2 minutes for your cash still sucks nearly as much as standing there for 10 minutes.  Yes it's an improvement but it doesn't solve the problem.
There are trust validation services popping up now and better ways of running bitcoin ATMs that look to make an ATM work like we'd expect so I'm guessing the same principal can be applied to any DC service too.

Blockchain is incredible and the best online wallet I've seen so far but keep in mind it is online system so still more likely to be compromised than a paper wallet you've generated via bitaddress or equivalent.

Never heard of Eleet so can't comment specifically on them although a quick google search shows they are closed source iOS messenger app so can't be audited.
It's all about levels or risk/convenience.  For large amounts use a hardware wallet is the only way to do it... you never want to have your bitcoin seed touch an online computer and HW wallets prevent the seed ever being seen by the connected world.  
The lesser secure way is to make sure you have access to your funds without Eleets permission, i.e. you have the seed to where the bitcoin is stored that you can use on say Electrum or other HD wallet.
My hunch is they'll probably be a bitcoin bank though where they hold the funds for you so you need to trust Eleet.  The good thing about bitcoin banks is if they are reputable you may have some insurance if they are hacked/stolen.  The risk is you are Eleet's mercy as to having access to your funds.
i.e. I would never store large amounts on services like Eleet because it's closed source and I doubt you have direct access to the funds.  Buy a HW wallet if you're storing significant sums or worried about keeping them safe.

Technically anything is possible but to change bitcoin to not use the blockchain would need incredibly hard proven testing to show it works and trustworthy. To do that youd setup another chain, perhaps with atomic swaps, to solve this and show the new technology works.
If it was shown to work far better than bitcoin people would want to sell their btc and buy the new coin at which point what is the advantage for bitcoin to change too?  All eggs in one basket springs to mind.
So in summary, no it is incredibly unlikely we would see bitcoin replace its working and proven engine.
We may however see another segwit style split but most likely see a new emerging coin that solves any bitcoin shortfalls IMHO(eg scalability, fungibility, privacy, qc enhancements, smaller min specs for nodes, improved usability, etc)
Right now ive yet to see a vastly better coin but there are contenders trying new approaches like iota, byteball, zcash, ethereum, etc so who knows, bitcoin is still a fascinating experiment.
@_date: 2014-01-22 13:35:23
That's actually a bloody good idea! Mining in the media generally misquoted.
Also talking cryptography should be avoided. Perhaps simplifying it like saying bitcoin has public addresses which can be thought of as bank accounts that merely store a btc balance in. Anyone can view these accounts so is safe to publicly share this to receive payments on, however you need the private key,ie password, to transfer some of that balance to another address.
You can have as many addresses as you'd like but typically have to buy or earn bitcoin from someone to put in an account.
The balances are stored by the bitcoin network so as long as you have that private key you can always spend it any time you have access to the internet.

Not at all, merely that the USD isn't the only thing driving the value of bitcoin and the exchange rate taken as a snapshot vs 1 week vs 1 year vs 2 years all tell incredibly different stories.
The truth is Bitcoin had way too much speculation going on at the end of last year that involved emotion rather than factual numbers.
In the long run bitcoin is still unique mixed with the networking effect and the adoption rate is constantly rising around the world.
I.e. buying all your bitcoin on one day and asking 'what's it worth?' in X days may be good or bad as who knows what the spot price will be in 24 hours.  Buying 0.1% of your savings as bitcoin every day over the year and analyse the valuation a year or two on and I'd expect you'll do far better than local inflation.
Who knows though, it is an experiment after all...

Imagine if Satoshi is an individual who made all of this, yes he/she could flog 1m coins on the market at once causing a crash but I see no reason why it would be irrecoverable. We still have nearly 10 million more btc to be mined so well over 1million entering circulation in our lifetime regardless and I'm not worried about that either.
It's not an endless supply so even if these coins were exchanged for $0.01 each the market value would still recover to precrash value * 1-(1,000,000/number in circulation) = 90% of it's current value given a year or so.
Secondly, it would be crazy to dump them all at once as it isn't a kill switch but just means the owner loses out on a vast amount of fiat exchange as they cause the price to temporarily crash, this is why people would make these sorts of trades offline and not on the exchanges... I believe 120k BTC were moved the other week like this and the price didn't even flinch.

I'm not a coinmixing fan, I share your concerns about it's use at the moment but I also see the practical use in future so withholding judgement for the longer good.
A legitimate use is that you don't want to expose your balance when trading.  E.g. if you buy a drink for someone, do you want a stranger to know you have 5000btc?  Without this you may find that drinks cost you more in future because they know you have more money.
Another example that springs to mind, a company paying salary payroll to staff.  You'd want this to be done via a mixing system to prevent knowing what each employee is being paid.
These two simple examples show why privacy helps some consumers hence a legitimate reason for mixing services in the future.
I'd like to see mixing services regulated however, firstly so the consumer can trust them, secondly so that if someone does use stolen funds an investigation can be started.
In practice the later is never going to happen as it would require a global consensus to be workable and given we can't globally act on climate change which is far more important I can't see this even being considered in our lifetime.

This isn't true I'm afraid, yes there are people out there who've had large sums stolen but mostly by doing daft things like not using cold storage for large sums/savings.  Yes right now it's not user friendly on explaining how much more secure we need to be in comparison to storing your bank details but equally this is why the coins are so cheap at the moment, this barrier to entry is currently high for newbies.
In time it will simplify when we get products like Trezor and multisigned wallets as standard but for the moment it keeps the coins cheap for people willing to do put this early adopter effort in.

'Should I buy now' = 'Do you think Bitcoin has peaked?'
pretty certain everyone here will say Bitcoin is only just beginning, not even 1% started so for the long run buying now is reasonable.  If you're planning on selling it within 6 months perhaps not, it's too volatile at the moment to assume it will be worth more in such a small timeframe.
It is also a very risky investment, the encryption could be broken, the network could be attacked, etc.. all cause the price to drop until the protocol is updated and trust is regained.  The chance of this being fatal is remote but remember it's an experiment and only 5 years old so there is always that chance.
My take on it is bitcoin is solid for large sum transactions and has a vastly huge usage ahead of it as the protocol continues to be proven and public trust in the digital commodity grows.
Right now it's too technical for the general public to care about it that much or get excited over and this will change as better products come out making it far more user friendly mixed with trusted brand names offering solutions.

Sort of yes and no, it's more involved as I'd over simplified.
The blockchain and blockchain technology I consider as two different things.  
'Blockchain' I interpret as the idea of a sequential database that is kept secure by mining.  'The blockchain' however I read as the bitcoin blockchain in particular.
Blockchain technology is useful for securing databases, it has it's uses... much like saying the quick sort algorithm has it's use and can be reapplied.  This tech is useful to ensure no database corruption occurs in a robust way.  It's not that difficult to set up and will certainly be used by others for securing very valuable information.  The issue is you need enough people wanting to mine (or paying them to mine) to keep it secure.  If they split off from bitcoins and essentially create their own alt coin they'll need to offer an incentive to miners as to why they should want to mine.   
"The blockchain", i.e. the Bitcoin blockchain is vastly more useful IMHO.  
It is the most secure database in the world that everyone has access to.  This has vastly profound implications for the financial world and in time as they learn to use it will become more and more the norm for anything time or content sensitive.
This can certainly be used by financial institutions and in particular the contracts approach like coloured coins, counterparty and the likes show how the blockchain can be used as the backbone for other facilities without using bitcoins at face value.  It's secured by the Bitcoin protocol and uses bitcoin to pay for the transaction fees and nominal values used to transfer ownership but they are considered as tokens with potentially vastly more value than their fungible market value.  E.g. a 0.000001 bitcoin may represent a share in a company or someone's house.  This is where I see a lot of disruption for the financial sector as it make issuing and trading shares vastly cheaper, easier and 24/7.  
That said, this technology still requires the bitcoin/tokens so they will need to use some bitcoin (could be cents) but it still uses them. If someone used the blockchain technology by itself however it wouldn't offer anywhere near as much security as the Bitcoin network does.

Thanks, when you say mempool is cleared, do you mean when they restart the bitcoind client or when a node has been found by that machine (or something else?)
Also when the client restarts, surely another client that still has this transaction in the mempool will now send it over to this restarted machine again or have I misunderstood how it transmits these?
I'm sure this isn't the case but seems impossible to get rid of 'dust' transactions with my current understanding.

I believe only spent coins with a change address as the source are potentially at risk here since the public key is not known until a spend takes place. Most old coins have never been spent and others are now in circulation using new addresses for change so protected... I expect it's pretty secure from quantum computers.

Anyone can make changes to bitcoin, it's all hosted on github and free to clone and modify.  There are a few key people who Satoshi trusted with his mainline access who can pull changes into this one.  With lack of a better definition this branch is 'the official' bitcoin protocol' everyone tries to use or replicate as it has the most testing done on it and the people running it are highly respected for competency and integrity.  
Most mining systems use this client for verifying the transactions and the blockchain which makes it the 'official bitcoin network protocol'.  The actual version considered the 'official one' is defined by which version of the client is commanding the most hashing power.  Typically miners don't risk using older clients at the risk of creating an orphaned block and therefore losing the 25BTC reward therefore the latest release from this github branch is *usually* the network's bitcoin version.  I say usually as there have been moments when people have rolled back to an earlier bitcoin client due to a hard fork appearing due to an unforeseen bug but is rare.
So to answer your qustion about what can change?  Anything can, but you need more than 50% of the hashing power to agree to your new rules for it to be officially adopted.  In practice it means only when it's added to the original Satoshi line and most miners agree it's good to include will a modification make it as part of the network.

How's about sharing your findings of the other exchanges?
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:40:59
I'm afraid I agree... random button bashing is not random at all.
You typically try to press some with your left hand then some with your right in equal measure.  That's already a vast degree of entropy removed.
Next you aim for middle buttons as that's the best chance of hitting the letters so you'll have more chance of hitting a f,g,h,j than say q,p,z,m
numbers you'll add in randomly but for the same reason as above you're more than likely to put a series of numbers next to each other.
Also captial letters are either always on or off as it's a pain in the ass to add/remove these randomly...
Whilst for a human to guess that string is incredibly unlikely, for a computer it's probably not.
Actually it's so not random I once made a password system that worked by timing a user's keyboard typing habits to identify them, i.e. not the actual password itself... it worked well enough that I believe there is no such thing as random and I bet the same principal could be applied to this if it was the norm.
You may however get away with it since very few people would take this approach and therefore not worthwhile to try and hack it :)

Bitcoin's strength is it doesn't suffer from these very issues.
It is true there are new coins being added to the system every 10 minutes which diminishes over time, so in that sense it is QE/inflation at a rate of 11% this year, 10% next, 9% in 2016 and halves in 2017 so becomes only 4% and so on.
The difference is the number of coins in circulation at any given point in time can be precisely answered and will never exceed the 21million limit to be reached in 2140.  For fiat currency there is no 'upper bound' so QE is essentially taking everyone using that currency when it happens.
0% interest rate policy I believe relates to fractional banking which all high street banks are involved in.  This is precisely why bitcoin was invented as this is a dangerous strategy that has seen governments bail out overstretched banks.  The alternative is letting the bank go bankrupt and all it's customers earned value disappear due to the fictitious account balances now shown to be worthless.
There is nothing stopping a bank or other institution doing the same with bitcoin too I may add!  This is what happened with MtGox for instance.  
Actual bitcoin balances where you control the private keys protects from these shady corporate practices as you know you always have access to your funds and they are very real.
That is not to say bitcoin is without it's risks, it's still only an experiment after all with just 5 years track record... just so far it seems to be surprising everyone at how robust it is.

Maidsafe - Dropbox but decentralised.
Ethereum - ELI5?  It let's you write programs that work on other people's computers running the ethereum network.  This is revolutionary but hard to do an ELI5 as the people doing it are visionary smart cookies with ideas most of us haven't considered yet.
In theory anything done on your home PC can be done with ethereum (logic wise) but because it's decentralised it's like making unchangeable programs that can perform useful function in the future when certain conditions happen.  An example is transfer ownership of an asset to someone/something when funds are transfered to a certain address.
Counterparty - Built on bitcoin's blockchain, not a new chain so already has inherent value.  It has taken the ethereum scripting system and magically made it work with the original bitcoin blockchain rather than having to use the ethereum chain.  It's a win for Bitcoin and Counterparty and may make Ethereum scripting the standard in making contracts for the future.  With this setup they made a great step forward to replace the functionality done by centralised places like NASDAQ and other stockmarkets around the world.  This would allow trading 24/7 of company assets and not require brokers or lawyers since a standard simple script can handle issuing company shares and paying dividends.

It is not EU rules, I heard it was Visa revoked the payment gateway company’s access that all ₿ cards used behind the scenes. Visa probably removed it due to ‘fraud risk’.
The payments system is run by closed archaic systems (mostly insecure xml forms between trusted parties) and is inherently flawed by design haemorrhaging money from fraud that merchants pay for, not visa.
It’s bizarre they are allowed to operate in the modern world with such insecure systems.  Apple, Google or even the banks themselves are soon to remove the need for visa/mc because those payment companies are too slow to adopt crypto and have a solution the tech companies will want to use.
Using bitcoin to replace closed payments is now financially and technically viable, merely needs the regulation to be clear before the tech companies move in.

Just to add, mining fees are currently only there to prevent people spamming the blockchain.. Over time however mining fees will adapt to market rates such that the miners will only accept a transaction if it's covering their running costs and a marginal bit of profit to make it worthwhile.

In simple terms we have 4 (very very large) numbers here...
* private key
* public key 
* data
* signature
The private and public keys are the cryptography bits and are calculated in such a way that they are related to each other.  The data is what we are encrypting.  For the purpose of this we will say data is just 1 large number too.
Now a signature is calculated by taking your private key and mixing it with the data number.  This is where the secret sauce happens because it's irreversible to determine the private key from just the data and signature.   That said, we can now take the signature number, combine it with the matching public key and you get back the original number of data.
This means if you give someone a signature and the public key and the data they can verify the signature+public key does indeed match that data very quickly so you must know they must know the private key to have made that signature.  
So Bitcoin converts your public key into an address... it's related to the public key but not actually the public key as has error checking in it for instance.  You can think of people sending the value of bitcoins to your public key.  Now only you can transfer value from that public key because you own the private key to create a valid signature of a transfer from that public address to another public address and produce a valid signature the miners can verify the transaction is genuine.
So I never saw SR so can't comment on the specifics but I expect they would have used escrow like bitmit (ebay clone) did.  Bitcoin has this built in so you can actually send funds from one address to another but require multiple private keys to allow the transfer to happen.  This is a pretty advanced topic that isn't found in most wallets yet but is used by sites needing escrow systems.
So that is the only bit of encryption Bitcoin uses.  What does mean to banking?
For banking you have to give your account number and sort code away to someone and trust them to only pull the right amount of money from your account for the transaction.  Once you've given those details away however there is nothing stopping them or anyone else they share your details with withdrawing any amount they choose from your account at any point in time.
So what banks are phasing in is chip and PIN machines which do a bit of this public/private key encryption where your PIN is the private key.  Given it's only 4 digits this is highly unsecure on the internet where you could go through all 10,000 pins in a fraction of a second.  This means pins are rubbish for internet transactions and why we don't see it.  Instead they use that 'redirect for validation' screen you may see pop up asking for 3 letters of your secret word. 
The biggest issue with all of this is they are still incredibly weak in comparison to well designed public/private key systems like Bitcoin. Secondly, banks control your funds meaning they can actually withhold your earned value.  Thirdly your 'value' in the bank is all fractional, i.e. 80%+ of it doesn't exist and why bank runs are a very serious risk for countries and difficult to solve other than locking down peoples funds.  And finally because of the simplicity of bank fraud they have to know who is making both parts of the transaction.  I.e. the merchant must identify themselves as must the buyer since the bank is must refund any fraud given it's their weak system that allows it to happen.
As for the anonymous nature of Bitcoin... the protocol is anonymous but if you were to do something illegal and your computer searched for private keys you can now be tied to every single transaction you've ever made with no way of ever deleting that history which would certainly be strong evidence in court.  This is why it's pseudoanonymous and a terrible idea to use for illicit purposes as I expect many discovered the hard way.

Make an app on an android phone designed for merchants so they can sell bitcoin to people easily. (Think point of sale)
E.g. the merchant says 'I have someone wanting to buy $10 worth of bitcoin' so taps in $10.
The device buys $10 worth of btc from an exchange via a server.  The user can see the exchange rate used and now holds their QR code or better still NFC enabled phone to transmit the send to location. 
Print a lovely message saying "Thank you, bitcoins sent"
The shop gets a user defined commission (set at say 2% or flat fee by default) paid as btc or fiat to their bank account via bitpay and ability to brand it with their store logo, name, etc..
What it needs is
- Be very fast transaction, talking seconds.  No confirmation needed as cash has been used.
- Be simple
- Generate money for shop
This would help allow people and merchants to eventually replace debit cards and share the savings with their customers.

I like the sentiment but China demonstrates how stopping the free internet is indeed possible, your faith in technology is overly optimistic and every data packet is already analysed.
Also regulation is intended to prevent bad things being done in society but is rarely done right with new technologies.  I think it's best to get reasonable, simple and therefore decent regulation so we don't end up with large corporations using war torn countries to purchase diamonds or offering Ponzi schemes for instance.
I'm certain the current proposal is vastly over burdening for ny which will just set them behind the rest of the world until it's changed but do believe the ethics of having a company having outside certification to know they are legit and not just stealing money is a good idea.
Perhaps it's best as an optional opt-in scheme rather than a law would make NY a finance center but seems unlikely they'll be the first now.

Good to brainstorm ideas however being critical Id say a few issues to work out are
- this only works for the current hardware. As hw becomes more efficient these will not make 50%+ of the network.
- these bulbs would need to verify the entire ledger, not just mine to be of any difference otherwise it's no different than a big pool.
- generally people want heat generators down low, not up high like a lightbulb as heat rises.
- the light numb would still need lighting functionality, better as wall plug.
- as exchange price rises more mining becomes viable so would need to ramp up quickly to match commercial mining.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:17:35
Yes and no.
It is technically possible yes however it's probably no longer feasible with the average hardware people have at home.
To put it into context, at the current difficulty you generate around $0.01/day per GHash.
A fast graphics card will generate around 0.1 GHash at most. 
On top of that the users would need a webGL enabled browser which isn't standard yet. (IE and mobile don't)
Finally you'd need them to run the machine 24/7 to generate that $0.001 per day and it would eventually ruin their hardware.
There was a famous case of someone doing this in a video game but I think he got fired for his ingenuity... it was a good idea really but I think it's because he mined for his own profit and didn't give an option that made it have the backlash.
Now if you could get everyone to plug in a very efficient USB that mines at &lt; 0.5W/Gh... now you have a viable decentralised alternative to the mining centers we see pop up.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:04:25
Short of reading the source and compiling it yourself you can't really.  Reputation is everything here, you have to believe the longer running wallets aren't going to stuff over their customers. 
I'd use a mobile wallet merely for spending money, i.e. it's probably fine (BRD, MyCelium, Jaxx, Copay, etc..) however for your savings and serious amounts use a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger... there is no getting away from the fact that unless you're willing to put the time in to verify it yourself you have to trust the wallets others trust.
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:37:07
Just to add, as I found this bit interesting...
On the front of the coin is a 'short code' so you can check the balance of the coin.
This shortcode is actually just the last few digits of the address so when you search for it in blockchain.info it looks at all previously credited addresses with an ending that matches this shortcode so you can see the balance.
The private key inside under the hologram is the only way to spend them.

Agreed, I read this as we're solving a problem that isn't really a problem for 99% of websites.
The main issue for websites is the database scalability and DOS prevention.
I'd be focused on this part before the sharing of HTML/JS/CS content.
For instance, make a standardized distributed database, probably like Google buckets, but have links to others so that the information is available somewhere... the more I type the more I think Storj's tech is going to be perfect for this should the experiment work.
This database however needs to syncronize with the latest information, that is going to be v tricky but sounds possible with blockchain/mining tech &amp; perhaps using shamir's secrets to ensure updates happen by concensus of nodes.  
Perhaps having the database tagged by block hashes to know when the last synchronization happened.    This would be web3.0 stuff, I think we're a long way from this happening.
Once that is solved, now the pretty layer on top that displays HTML/CSS can be added.. probably part of the same database tbh.

Have you had a look into multisignature stores?  This way you could give a family friend one part of the key and you have the other.

Remember if someone gains &gt;50% of the network power all they can do is sustain a DoS attack against transactions and unwind history based on how much &gt; 50% hashing power they have and use maliciously off the mainline to generate their fork.
Firstly let's address this rewriting possibility.  An attacker can only rewrite to a point because if it becomes very obvious (e.g. forking and rewriting an entire day's worth of transactions) I think most people would look to peg bitcoin to the longest chain before that attack and (given the extreme scenario here) modify the SHA256(SHA256(m)) hashing algorithm to something like Script or birthday collision mining, or another..  all would effectively destroy the usefulness of all existing ASIC miners and make all that equipment simply noisy room heaters.  
The miners know this would be a self destructive attack in that it only damages themselves and bitcoin would adapt and survive without them.
Preventing transactions however is more subtle and may take longer to notice...  If this was occurring again it merely prevents the transaction from going through on their watch.  If they were really determined they could replace the occasional blocks that would appear including the transaction they're trying to ban.  I'd like to believe that if this was for a significant transaction it would become apparent and the mining algorithm could be adjusted as citizen consensus that the miners were abusing the system is eventually is achieved.
TL;DR:  IMHO A fully state controlled mining solution isn't much of a long term risk to bitcoin, they could potentially cause temporary network disruption if they went full kamikazi but the open source nature means the mining algorithm is open to being changed if the 50%+ miners behave maliciously.
A state could do far more damage for less money with a DoS of nodes... again it's only temporary while they sustain the attack.  
Overall I wouldn't worry about it unless you track the price day by day.

This just means blockchain.info could be hardcoded to say it's been credited (actually more likely you just spoof blockchain.info locally via a mobile hotspot that rewrites the address), people unlock their machines and life goes on.

The bitcoin-qt creates 100 future change addresses so your backup is likely to have also had the private keys to the funds you send and the change returned to a different address since the backup.
I.e. if anyone copied your wallet.dat file (backup or otherwise) they'd have had access to all your past and future funds.

I never claimed bitcoin ATMs are better exchange rates than regular atms yet, I do believe it will happen in time but certainly not there yet as people are recovering costs with little competition as they are so new.
You can get a fair fiat exchange rate via local bitcoins which should be better than a banks but you've dismissed this comment so looks like you're trying to highlight only issues.
Allow me to help, bitcoin is still an experiment, no one claims it's the silver bullet for all financial woes. What it is however is a platform to develop on by anyone.
If you think ATMs suck, write your own (or hire someone to write it for you if you can't code)
The fact it is impossible to do this in the banking structure yet is possible with bitcoin is the  important point here and why so many VCs and companies are excited about it.

Coinpunk is looking the best bet, it's a webpage tailored for iPhone and can save the shortcut to your springboard so looks and works just like an app.
It's an excellent open source project so if you do use it please try and tip the developer at least $1 as they're not getting payment from appstore downloads and doing us all a great service making it.
I would highly recommend NOT jail breaking your phone, this opens it up in very dangerous ways that you can not reverse by wiping... especially if you're holding real value on there.  If you do jailbreak it don't install any 'free' apps as rarely there is a free lunch and just takes one key logger, network forwarder or vnc backdoor... if you do jailbreak and install freebies make sure you download Charles on a PC (soon to accept bitcoin too!) so you can have some peace of mind on what info is being transmitted by your phone.

There's $12 trillion M2 money in the world (cash+savings+investments).
This means it's $12,000 Billion yet bitcoin's worth is approximately 11 million coins x $600 = ~$7 Billion.
Therefore I guess we're at 7/12000 = 0.05% which from a scale of 1 to 10 puts it at a solid 1 (and increasing at an incredible rate for an experiment only 5 years old!)

What I dont' get is why fight a new superior technology that can not be un-invented?  MC are well poised to embrace DCs and make huge saving be eradicating fraudulent payments, simplifying their network, making it vastly more secure and actually storing value for people outside of a bank.  If Visa or Amex realize the opportunity here they're going to wipe the floor with the competition.  
If none of them embrace the next generation of payment systems they're going to be annihilated in a blink of an eye as Apple Pay/Google/Microsoft/PayPal/etc.. flick a switch and suddenly cards disappear and everyone is using DC backed systems.
Does MC really think people like Apple will want to pay MC for their services if there is a free alternative?

They certainly can but the stakes are far higher.
Everyone knows that if you rob a bank you go to jail, therefore less people do it, therefore the police can focus efforts on that small majority that do attempt it.  If the do succeed a bank can usually undo the damage as those bank balances are just numbers they fully control.
There are also very clear international laws about stealing from a bank, bitcoin is in legal limbo where most people still don't understand it yet so hackers are currently using that to their advantage.
In time it will become just as serious but right now it's a fringe so not as much protection available.

Actually he has a point, for a company to actually own (or look after someone else's) btc they need to protect it well.
A large company like EY would need multisig and an air gapped system with backups only visible and created by people they really trust all controlled via custom internal system to interface and communicate with the blockchain.
I.e. There are no services to do this in a big corporation yet that I'm aware of as the technology is still so young, it will happen but right now there are few services for internal systems for large companies.

In person payments made safely and easily.
So give a recommended phone/tablet and app for merchants to use and demo videos on how to use it in practice.
Show how said payment can be easily and quickly converted to local fiat if they optionally want to.
Minimize touches/presses needed by client and merchant.
The bitcoind,multibit, blockchain clients to be able to easily sweep import keys (optionally password protected)
Have multiple confirmations on large value transfers.  
Default to delayed transfers so they can be cancelled within 1 minute before the real transaction is sent out for instance... Gives a basic 'undo' option that can be disabled of skipped if necessary.
Simplify address entry via name coin style lookups
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:50:38
An organization will always have the ability to choose to publicly disclose who it made payment to or not... bitcoin neither inhibits or encourages this, what it does do however is show irrefutable proof the value has been transferred and these trades could allow questions to be asked if say the tax money payments out didn't match the values published as to how much is spent on various departments.

If you are running the full client with the full blockchain you are supporting the network as you're essentially contributing to the security of the network.
You may not be mining which is arguably more important in practical sense of earning a reward for securing it but should bitcoin fork or get vandalised you have one of the backups that can be verified against.
So actively improving the network on a day by day basis?  If you're in an oppressive country then yes absolutely helping the citizens there.  If in a more open country it's arguable how much difference it actually makes unless there is a fork.

Regulation only effects the ethical uses of it, if the barriers are too high it merely puts that country/state at a disadvantage to the rest of the world for global trade whilst doing nothing to prevent the nefarious purposes aspect for that country/state where it will continue with or without regulation.

A very overly simple approach to understand what it's doing in principal is you have a look up table of word = number.  I.e. pick 100,000 words and a each word a number between 00000-99999.  This look up table must be consistent and does differ from electrum and other deterministic wallets.
So imagine the word "testicles" translates to the number 52152 in the look up table.  Lets represent 52152 as the 5 digits as AAAAA.  The second word creates another number, let's call it BBBBB and so on...
Using the twelve words you can just stick them together to get this vast meganumber is...
X = "AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDDEEEEEFFFFFGGGGGHHHHHIIIIIJJJJJKKKKKLLLLL"
We'll chuck some 0's on the end too for our addresses...
X = "AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDDEEEEEFFFFFGGGGGHHHHHIIIIIJJJJJKKKKKLLLLL00000"
Now you can use this number as the private key and derive the public key from it.
Next to create a new address you can just add 1 to this number X.  Again derive the matching public key for this number and that translates to a bitcoin address.
X = "AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDDEEEEEFFFFFGGGGGHHHHHIIIIIJJJJJKKKKKLLLLL00001"
X = "AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDDEEEEEFFFFFGGGGGHHHHHIIIIIJJJJJKKKKKLLLLL00002"
I believe it will keep adding addresses until it finds say '6' (Im guessing here) consecutive unfunded addresses and can assume no more need to be searched so stops checking at this point.  I believe this look ahead can be modified in preferences.
This is why I believe you see 6 addresses by default.
(Apologies to anyone who really spent time understanding electrum as I know I've not done it justice here and is far more advanced but I believe this captures the principal)

It's a way to ensure that it's random who's selected to veriify the last ~10minutes of transactions and combine them into a single block that is appended to the end of the blockchain (which they have also indirectly verified).  For doing the work they are rewarded with new coins (25 at the mo) + transaction fees.  
In a nutshell, it's a way to make sure that anyone anywhere in the world can do it in principal and there is no point in trying to cheat the system as if they haven't followed the rules they lose that reward since their block would be discarded by the next random person if it wasn't correctly done.

There is a fringe case where it is useful.  If you have a server running a custom hashing system  and tag all sequential data entries in your database based on the hash of previous entries (i.e. a blockchain) , anyone wanting to corrupt/modify your database would need sufficient power*time to make a modification to your database.  It's a great way to protect very sensitive data.  For instance a bank or credit card company may benefit from having this level of security... it sort of boggles the mind that these companies haven't been compromised yet as I bet they're just chucking values into some db like was done in the 90's.

I stand corrected about Lloyds, I'm merely repeating what I'd heard published from Elliptic so if that's since been correct I sincerely apologise for repeating inaccurate info but so much going on it's hard to disseminate truthful statements from corporate marketing bs.
Regarding faster payments in UK, yes this is good for GBP-GBP transfers, I'm not contesting that it is good but you asked why bitcoin is better and I gave just one example of one thing a digital currencies can do right now that fiat and bank/debit/credit cards can't.
SEPA however.. I can't believe you're bringing that one up as a positive over digital currencies!  This is like having a debate over straw houses and bricks and the pro straw candidate says 'Look I can set fire to my house to keep me warm in winter'.
My UK bank doesn't support SEPA and it's one of the big 5.  You're clearly one of the lucky ones who does but I'm stuck with SWIFT (ironic name).
Anyhow, SEPA charges £5 transfer fee + 1-3 BUSINESS days in transferring funds whilst the bank is using your money.  They can block payments without reason too so should they not like that company or perhaps they don't have the funds available or they think it's too much they can block it.  So yes they suck badly as a consumer from that point of view.
SWIFT, my alternative, is even worse at £10 and up to 5 business days later the funds may arrive if indeed the forms submitted were accepted and filled in correctly.
This is insane to the point where I wrestled with buying a flight out to the states to do a trade because it was going to take too long otherwise.  I'm not even going to waste time explaining how I see a dc system is better for this because it should be pretty obvious. 
As a business owner I have to wait days (and even weeks for American business) funds to be transferred.  The fact that I even have to use a bank for these services is crazy when you think about it but it's what we've grown up with and never questioned before.
Regarding the 5 minute transfer time with guaranteed funds service, for that to even compete with a digital currency it needs to be cheaper than few pence to send, available 24/7 and can be done from my computer without going into the branch... anything less and it's substandard to a DC.  Right now people exchange btc back to local fiat as that's what the vast majority use so there is a crippling fee here of 4-5% which is awful but in time this will reduce due to competition and less and less reason to convert back to fiat if you need btc in future.... I think Circle has caught onto this idea but we'll see...

A wallet contains all your private keys.  You have 1 private key per public key.  An address is made from the public key number and just includes safety checks in so it can't be mistyped or hacked easily.
So it goes private key generates a public key, public key generates an address.   Your wallet stores all the private keys in it.
Each time you spend funds from an address it's considered good practice that all your change goes to a NEW address rather than your original address so you wallet is constantly adding new addresses for each transaction you make.  In practice your wallet generates these future addresses ahead of time so the bitcoind client actually creates 100 addresses for you and will use one of these each time you make a new transaction.  As it does this it creates 1 new address to put into the pool so at any given time it has all your old private keys and 100 future private keys it can use... This point is important for backups!  You need to take regular backups if you're doing lots of transactions as if you had a backup from 1st Jan 2014 and you make 101 transactions you will now be using a private key you haven't got backed up yet.  This is why deterministic wallets are easier, these generate the private keys for you in a deterministic way so you only need to back up the starting point and from this it can calculate every private key you'll ever use. (Electrum wallet is the best example of this)
Moral of the story, backup fairly often ;)
To answer your second question, can someone else have the same address as you... mathematically yes it is possible.  The odds however are so astronomically remote it's never going to happen.  Best analogy I can think of is imagine your private key is unique to picking any two grains of sand anywhere on earth.   For someone else to clash they'd have to pick the exact same two grains of sand you found by pure random guessing... that's how incredibly unlikely it is and these vast random numbers are precisely why cryptography can work.

The price of bitcoin is not driven by mining, it's the other way around.
If the price of btc falls, miners turn their HW off as it's not profitable.
There is correlation between the rewards and the price given the rewards are increasing supply but ultimately it's the demand for btc that is driving the price since the supply is fairly steady.
It's an economist's dream environment to study the effects of a predictable increasing resource.

If the company had been audited regularly and had security requirements it wouldn't have been the huge mess it is. Trusting a private company is a bad idea without independent regulation.  If the regulation becomes stifling companies will just move to another country.

I may be wrong here but I think you're talking about blockchain.info and the comments there are stored by that private company in their own database... The blockchain typically doesn't store text annotations like this, I say typically as you can send funds to invalid addresses that when viewed in an ASCII view spells short messages(this technique can also be used by people to time stamp physical goods too by creating a hash of the digital message they're stamping and sending 0.0000001 btc there.  
So to answer your q, you need to use blockchain.info website's API to get these comments I expect.

We will see more and more people move to P2Pool in the coming weeks as it's simplified and better UI's appear.
If GHash or any pool with &gt;50% did something stupid like a double spend/rollback or coin generation you'd see them being dropped instantly and with a vengence.  The only reason they'd do this is to crash the market temporarily to buy cheap coins while everyone abandons the pool, it's simply not sustainable to keep a malicious 51% attack.

I think Bob has answered this really well but just to add...
'How do the bitcoins sent to that address get to my computer'
Your computer does not 'store these bitcoins', instead everyone has a copy of that blockchain ledger you don't have to to download but have because you're using the full reference client.
What's happening is that anyone anywhere in the world can see how many coins a certain address has, when you make a transaction the coins are deducted from one address and credited to another in essence.  
What's different is you have the private key to be able to send coins from any of your public addresses, only you can do that because guessing that private key number it uses is virtually impossible.
So as long as you have your private key(s) (i.e. wallet that contains all the private keys), you can spend those funds on any computer connected to the bitcoin network.

This way they can see it didn't matter if the school was here in the US or somewhere else like Ethiopia.

That is the address where you can send funds to but you need to make sure you have the private key (starts with a 5???? or 6???? if you have set a password on it).
I'd recommend using bitaddress.org to generate these paper wallets as this prints both the public key (the 1???? number) and the private key on the same piece of paper and can therefore be used anywhere.
(edit) sorry seen you say you used BlockChain for it, they do allow you to download the private key so that is great to use... make sure you keep a couple copies of this private key as if you lose it nobody (even blockchain.info) can retrieve it. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:01:25
Yes but you'll not get full clarity.
For instance you'd need the various organization(s) to declare their incoming addresses to differentiate money moving from department to department.  What would be tricky is it's best practice to use a different address on each transaction and therefore it could get very difficult to do this.
Blockchain.info has the ability to tag addresses so you'd need the organizations to register all incoming addresses in a database like this (which makes blockchain.info set to be another google if that were to happen!)
In the long run, yes this seems a very good and sensible idea on the face of it.  In practice there are a lot of hurdles to get through before people will realize this is possible and the benefits it offers citizens.

But whooaaaa, that's like the miners stealing money!

To be fair it may be too high for you but 5% sounds a pretty good deal to me, I pay that for fees in buying btc from an exchange after all the conversions are done. If they offer consumer protection, insurance and instant money transfer to and from other bitcoin related accounts I'm probably going to use them as my online hot wallet for regular spends along side blockchain.info for those larger transactions.

It's probably worth sharing with others. 
Personally I'll never use BrainWallets as happy with electrum and other techniques that have proved more secure but know I'll get asked it one day so wanted to be sure there's nothing unique about brainwallets.
(I.e. electrum uses the words as a seed for all addresses but guessing a brainwallet gives a single address?)

MtGox is currently not allowing any USD or Bitcoin to be withdrawn from their exchange.  There's a lot of speculation as to if they have gone bust.
If you want to take the risk you can absolutely buy some cheap bitcoin (on their books).  If they enable withdrawals again you'll have got a bargin.  If they close up shop, you've lost everything as the bitcoin are just a fictious number on their accounts rather than you owning a private key to any real bitcoin.

My guess is LTC's price was held up by people who used to mine btc with GPUs and moved to litecoin trying to raise it's profile so their mining rigs are worth something.  With Asic scrypt miners, anyone with a GPU mining machine will be getting out of ltc pretty quick if btc is anything to go by.  That means flogging their gear or jumping to another altcoin that is asic resistant.  i.e. they're jumping ship from ltc as it serves no use to them any more.

Don't take offense to some of these aggressive responses, you're right that it's incredibly hard to do and currently not worthwhile to hack so is a reasonable system HOWEVER it's only reasonable because so few people do it... the issue is that humans are terrible at picking random stuff even though we think we're good at it.  You understand this, many won't and will just hit the keyboard thinking it's random when it is far from it.
Watch some Derren Brown and you'll see how predictable people are.
Brainwallets suffer exactly the same, it's no different than electrum I believe but because people pick the words it's very very insecure and there have been thefts on what should be a secure system.
Yes there is a good degree of randomness in there but if there was $10,000,000+ stored in this method that's a bloody good incentive to brute force the restricted search space with some vast cloud computing.

BIP38 is just about taking that private key as a bunch of characters "5kjb34349876njewlkj34" and then encrypting this with a random password you've picked to give some gibberish like "6hj3245kjbndgkljsdk84"  
Now the only way to go from 6hj3245kjbndgkljsdk84 back to the unencrypted private key 5kjb34349876njewlkj34 is by using your password.
This password is intended so that should your encrypted private key ever leak it will take time for someone to bruteforce it to find the original private key.
It differs from a brain wallet in that brain wallets use the random words to generate a single specific private key set.  BIP38 password merely encrypts any private key.

The bitcoin network is running at 180PHash.
Whilst no floating point operations are used in hashing, the best comparison I’d heard was from gmaxwell on bitcointalk who suggested putting a supercomputer on hashing to see how fast that is and use that as the benchmark guide.
He came up with the formidable Jaguar machine that does 1.75petaFlops can calculate 522Ghash on its CPU logic (
Using this figure on trust, we can make a very very rough benchmark that a 1petaFlop supercomputer should be able to produce in the order of 300Ghashes.
So this latest supercomputer of 33.86petaflops, assuming the integer cores scaled the same way, would produce a supercomputer capable of producing 33.86x300= 10,000GHash = 10THash.
Given the bitcoin network is running at 180,000Thash it would require 18,000 of the worlds current fastest super computer to match bitcoin network’s calculation speed.
Given there is only one of these perhaps it’s better to say the top 500 supercomputers together produce 274petaflops of calculation, if we assume their logic speed mirrors their floating point speed this produces = 82THash if all 500 were mining.
This means we can have some fun by saying (180,000THash / 82Thash ) x 500 computers = over a million super computers to match bitcoin’s network hashing power.
Ok, I know it’s comparing apples and cars but 1,000,000 supercomputers gives a good indicator to a newbie about how much processing power is securing bitcoin these days.

It only references the previous transaction(s) of where the funds have come from that you are using to make the new transaction.  The previous transaction it references does the same so whilst you can explore this chain to follow the values back to their inception at mining, you don't need to do this due to the mining/block formation.
Approximately every 10 minutes the latest 'block' of transactions gets a stamp of approval from a random miner around the world saying 'all the transactions earlier in the blockchain and these new transactions have been verified to be correct'  This means when you go to spend some funds it only needs to check one step back, not the entire chain.

Bitcoin excels at large transactions over the internet and storing value outside of banks.  Whilst it can be used for daily transactions, it is far clunkier than the processes like credit cards which have had decades to be refined over.  This refinement is coming to bitcoin too and your points are valid but think of Bitcoin as the foundation layer people can now openly build on to make it vastly easier than even creditcards. 
Realistically it doesn't make sense to put every coffee transaction into the blockchain, instead it makes sense that starbucks has a single blockchain entry per day for all their stores to consolidate their earned value... this makes it an exciting opportunity for 3rd party companies like bitpay, paypal, etc... to exist and make the user experience easy enough for a 5 year old to use.

Like iPhone's jailbreaking, on Android people can sometimes 'root' it meaning you get access to the lowest levels methods on the phone to allow things such as changing the phone's IMEI number, change the OS to another version of Android, etc...  I.e. it opens up admin permissions and bypasses the chain of trust.
Most of the time this rooting is fine but it's like playing Russian roulette when money's involved since you've now made it possible for a malicious app to read/write anything on your phone meaning it could in theory read your private keys from storage or memory, record key presses, internet traffic, etc...
Usually it's a case of 'who cares?' but when you've got a lot of bitcoin on a device I'd be hesitant rooting it.

They're tied into vast majority of shops as a POS.
You could fund your card with bitcoin by transferring to a given address.
For them to accept it they'd just need to treat bitcoin as a foreign currency.
No bank fees required for them.
Additionally other people can now top up your MC, you could be paid directly to your MC account via bitcoin, again no bank required.
They are in an absolute sweet spot if they embraced it, but sounds like someone else will do it first and history is rarely kind to second place.

* At this point, getting into mining is not feasible at all unless you have access to a supercomputer.
Even a supercomputer is vastly unprofitable for the electricity used.  You'd need a dedicated ASIC and free electricity for it to be considered worthwhile nowadays.
* I want to purchase bitcoins and start using them. What is currently the best method for doing so? How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US?
Circle.com is probably easiest if you have access otherwise localbitcoins.com or an exchange like bitstamp.  Again all 3 are fairly easy to go from BTC back to USD if you have a bank account.
Bitcoin exchanges are relatively safe, just move your bitcoin out of them if you just want to purchase coins.  I.e. install Etherum on PC/mac or a good native wallet for iOS/Android.  Type  into the browser to automatically detect and install the best wallet for that device.

In fairness of disclosure,  I don't live in the US.
Huge profits in usd is not meaningful to an international community, it is excellent  internally and should generate funds for more taxes to repay its debts which is good for all. Profits however do not automatically represent a healthy economy.
I'm not saying btc will replace usd, that seems *incredibly* unlikely and circle jerk talk, it does however look feasible that it may become a precious metal replacement in time and if there isn't a fundamental flaw in the protocol.  With btc being far easier to manage it starts giving a better representation of value for all foreign currencies since it's value is derived by everyone around the world and not based on debt repayment speculation of one currency.

Without tempting fate I can't see any fatal flaw that could happen that would be break bitcoin forever.  Not saying serious bugs couldn't happen but to break the protocol seems impossible now.
Take some worst case scenarios (e.g. someone cracks elliptic curve, someone finds a way to solve SHA256 to a required value instantly breaking the mining algorithm, transfers are sent to unspendable addresses due to a design issue...).   All incredibly unlikely I may add!
All of these would be painful in regards to confidence but a hard fork can easily be made and picked up from a point in the past.  Transactions would become unconfirmed again until mining resumed, miners would be freaking out as it's a huge loss of earnings during the rollback, a malicious technical person could double spend any transactions that were rolled back before the new mining picks them up but that's about it.  I.e. life would return to normal pretty quickly should even the absolute worst case scenario happen as far as I can tell... I'm open to more devastating issues if anyone can think of any!
So to answer OPs question, what other alts would I invest in?  None for this risk mitigation... I do see huge value in alt coins innovating new technologies however yet to hear of any that offer anything significantly more than bitcoin already offers.

Unless your compiler is compromised, binary replaced, etc... There's too many ways to do it on a home PC unfortunately, especially if big money gets involved.
Spending several years crafting perfect targeted malware, even physically breaking in, all become feasible when millions are involved.
Trezor is a good first step but there is much much more to come.
Luckily demand supply means if the value and usage appreciates so will the security ecosystem.
I do like this guys website as fed up people saying bitcoin is easily stolen.  It's not when handled correctly, sadly not everyone is confident in paper wallets, multisig, and what is/isn't relatively safe yet.

I don't hate them but I believe the sentiment is 
Firstly they are centralizing mining, this is bad for Bitcoin generally as you want many distributed machines verifying the blockchain rather than 1 machine running Petahash of mining power.
Secondly their return to customers is less than just buying bitcoin.  They're essentially playing on people's ignorance to mining and the maths behind it.
Thirdly because they're encouraging people to put their money in and essentially make a loss it makes the whole mining ecosystem a loss so those that mine privately are now making far less money than they should on paper because the mining power is going up faster than it really can.
Fourthly they are a private company so an easy target.
Finally there is some speculation that it's just a ponzi scheme whereby the profits are repaid by other investors until the whole thing collapses.  This is other people's speculation and probably bullshit since you can determine where the coins you've earned have come from but it is plausible since they are essentially returning less to investors than they put in.
TL;DR:  Cex don't appear to be ethical and not representing the decentralised ethos behind bitcoin.

I believe not all combinations of that 2^256 number are valid private keys.

I'd explain to your father that any money you're converting is something you're happy to lose if it doesn't take off but you've taken the time to research it and want to be involved at this stage.
Remember it is only an experiment, albeit a very effective one, so no one here or elsewhere has seen this before and can therefore predict the future with any certainty.  
I think you're wise to get involved in what you're interested in, life's too short and if you don't do something unique or memorable life becomes very boring ;)  I try to think how you will feel if btc goes either way.  If it takes off would you be annoyed you listened to your father and equally if it all collapses due to an unforeseen flaw will you be regretting getting involved at this time?

I feel for you but this is nothing to do with bitcoin.  Firstly you gave your money to some dodgy unproven gambling site who ran with the money.  Secondly you invested in something that is not bitcoin, probably one of the hundreds of pump and dump alts out there who prey on newbies.
Both painful lessons but the blunt truth is you did invest in bitcoin and then deinvested in it with moving your value into gambling site and an alt coin, both were unfortunate disasters so no one will give you the same or more bitcoin back for their current valuation.
If you wanted to 'invest' in bitcoin to avoid the loss of value fiat incurs from inflation that is reasonable but if you want to do even more with it it's a risk and how much you want to make depends on the risk you'll take.  For instance you can take a small risk by offering your coins for shorting on at places like BitFinex (I've not done this myself so forgive me if I've said the wrong site name).  
The next level of risk is investing in bitcoin companies via a proven broker.  Haverlock investments offers these but don't invest in mining companies as they're all about to go tits up.
The next level of risk is investing directly in a bitcoin company, much like you did on the dice one so you'll know to do your background checks first... make sure you meet the people in person before giving them a satoshi!
Like I say I feel for your loss and wish you a speedy financial recovery but please remember you've not been burnt by bitcoin at all but because you gave your bitcoin to what turned out to be scams.

They're probably going to be beaten to the finish line by OpenBazaar and others at this rate.  
People will then trade physical goods for bitcoin and visa versa there and gradually over time it'll dawn on the general public these 'credits' aren't restricted to that one website and they may stop exchanging them back to local fiat.  
At this point a leading digital currency store will be established quickly, if it's not ebay or amazon they're going to get hurt badly as history shows us there is normally only one that wins.
 
Cex seems to have noted this and already accepting bitcoin but that's for physical shops, makes me laugh though as it's the internet where digital currencies really make sense yet it seems to be doing pretty well in the physical world too.
The fact ebay is connected to PayPal makes if very political internally at a guess, I'd be expecting to see bitcoin on PayPal before we see it on ebay.

Is this logic correct?
-If they buy for less than market price the market will drop as they unload some coins for extra profit until it reaches their private purchase price.  The market may continue down for a little bit as people panic sell if the price is significant (i.e. they bought the coins privately at say a 20% discount)
- If they buy the coins at a premium no dip should happen as they'd be mad flogging them at a loss.  Therefore the bitcoin/usd price will likely continue to rise over time.

Calm down, you asked a question that is asked here daily... It's a question everyone thinks about when first learning about digital currency but there are some who use it without thinking just to annoy because they are like trying to teach cats why gold is valuable. There are some arses in this world, don't take it personally, some just like feeling superior when they understand something others are still in the process of learning.  Your question is valid, just it's been answered many times and in better ways than my short synopsis. All I can say is read more about it and make your own mind up about why an emp won't damage the system or why people can now perceive its value.

So many reasons but here's 3 of my favourites that may or may not be appropriate for you.
Travelling abroad.  No travellers cheques, rip off exchange rates or any of that rubbish.  Just buy the local fiat with bitcoin.  You don't even need to take your computer of phone with you, just remember 12 words and you can access your stored value anywhere in the world.  
Another is purchasing high value items like a car.  Instant irrefutable transfer of value.  Purchasing a car for &lt; $5000 is feasible with cash but you have to go to a bank and may get mugged.  &gt; $5000 the merchant has to wait until the funds clear which takes time and money.
But my favourite is that digital currencies have been designed since the internet exists and so has been designed for it. 
Imagine ebay where you have no fees as a buyer or seller.. that is OpenBazaar and others like it that will be appearing in the coming years.

"It [CHAPS] normally operates between 0600 and 1600 on weekdays" 
 
* Bitcoin's 100% uptime since inception

* Transfers happen almost instantly and confirmed in minutes
If anyone is still in any doubt as to how archaic current financial systems are in comparison to digital currencies this is a good example.

I dont' think Bitcoin will replace PayPal, they offer services that bitcoin can't.  (validating the merchant, allowing chargebacks, picking sources where to fund payment from).

@_date: 2014-12-23 11:56:15
I share your view on occasion, especially when you see a devaluing market price like we have for 2014 BUT what makes me know this is still very early days and is on track to becoming mainstream.
- Watch transaction volume, this has been growing linearly even before and after the madness last year.  This is an incredibly strong sign.
- There is no significant competition or better technology currently available to transfer value over the internet without needing a company.  This is fairly irrelevant to the market price as international payment can be deposit/withdraw in minutes.  The technology will allow new innovation like autonomous companies which we've not even seen appear yet.
- Bitcoin is the worlds first and leading digital store of value that is global and free from any fiat based currency.
Doesn't matter if only 100 people use it or the billions use it, the fact it has value to people anywhere and is finite shows it can only continue to gain momentum in the long run.  As more people use it the more the price will stabilize as the perceived value migrates more towards utility value.
My hunch is bitcoin will be used as a store of value or large sum transfers in years to come.  I find it hard to believe it would be used to buy coffee or clothes in a physical shop as like you say we have pretty good solutions for this.
The online world is where it's designed for but I'm sure people will find more and more solutions to allow bitcoin to be used in the real shops as well.
Bitcoin excels at international payments, large sums of value transactions where you want to ensure there is 100% guarantee there'll be no charge back.  
In time bitcoin could become the global commodity underpinning fiat currencies.
E.g. Buy bitcoins in country A and sell those bitcoins in country B and now exchange country B's money back to country A and make a profit after the fees you're printing money.  If country A has some volatility you can now move value to bitcoin and wait to see which country B,C,D,etc... is going to give you the best exchange rate back and finally return your money to country A but magically you've got more now.
If people in Russia knew this I'm sure we'd be seeing a price surge right now, my hunch is the surge isn't there simply because it's not well known and people fear the unknown... not to mention I think they tried to ban it precisely because their citizens could do this.

Giving people your private key is a very bad idea generally, it's risky for you (your transaction can be intercepted and poof it's gone without knowing who took it), and bad for them (they don't own the funds so you can take that money from them if they don't move it)

I love the start of this video, very professionally made!  I was about to send some of my less technical friends who ask how it works as it is very elegant start ... however the video jumps into very specific details and particularly mining and double spend issues which most really won't care about. 
It's like explaining how lift works on an aeroplane, yes it's interesting and important but is a distraction to people who just want to know what an aeroplane is.
I have to admit from the start of the video I was expecting the target audience to be a newbie wanting to know what bitcoin is rather than a training video on how it works.  If it is for a newbie I'd love to see 2 videos edited from this on, 1 an easy intro you could send an 8 year old to get an understanding how it works (i.e. your ledger, transaction and decentralised part) and a second which is for more technical people wanting to know how it works with signatures and mining.
Most people won't want to know about signatures/hashes etc, only technical people care about that and sadly most of the documentation and videos already out there cater to the more technical people only and the simple ones are patronising so there is definitely a niche that needs filling that an edited version of this could provide.

Thanks and I believe I follow this hashing but this article is deriving the public address from the public key.  What I'm interested in knowing is how the private key can establish the public address.
I.e. when I import a key starting with 5xxxxxx it somehow magically knew the corresponding 1xxxxx public address.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding it but my understanding was going from private-&gt;public key is not feasible to calculate so seems like this public address must somehow be stored with the private address?
This article seemed closer to what I was after but still doesn't explain it.

And what is backing gold, platinum, fiat or land?
It's easy, it's a finite resource but can be subdivided.  People trade with finite resources, bitcoin is no different in this respect.  What makes it unique is it's the only resource that can be traded digitally and without a specific government controlling it, this is why people are starting to get excited about it.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:14:05
Just to clarify the responses.
There is no such thing as a 'coin', instead think of it as a bunch of bank accounts (called addreses) with balances stored in it.  These balances can have up to 8 decimal places of precision.  When you send 0.1 btc to someone it merely adds 0.1 to their address balance and subtracts 0.1 from yours.
You can only send money from an address when you know the private key(i.e. password) for that address.
That's all it is really ;)
A full node means it downloads the full blockchain and verifies it, anyone can do this.  A miner needs to run a full node or connect to someone who does.  Typically miners contribute to a mining pool where by the pool owner receives the 25BTC reward if one of the contributors solves the problem but then that 25BTC is then shared out to all contributing miners in the pool based on their contribution over time.  This way everyone gets a small and more regular revenue stream.  
Also a miner doesn't have to use bitcoin QT, this is just one of many implementations that talks the language of Bitcoin.  It happens to be the most popular since it was the first and had the most work done on it however most exchanges for instance would have their own version of bitcoin client that does the same as the reference one but more specialised for their purposes of securing deposits/withdrawals.

You can easily transfer more than $5k out of the country but you can't with cash.  This limitation is impossible to enforce with digital currencies.
Sadly trying to put bitcoin, the circle shape, into cash (the triangle) or commodity (the square) hole is just not going to cover everything.
Digital currencies are new and can do what cash and commodities can along with a lot more so should be treated as what it is, a totally new financial instrument.
As for regulation I think the best they can do is say 'don't pay for illegal things otherwise you're breaking the law and the blockchain will be used as proof in a court of law'.
Anything more doesn't stop theses illicit things anyhow and even if they did evolution shows a more dangerous crypto will appear that is impossible to regulate at all.
 
Right now this key fact keeps getting overlooked,  it should never be the transfer of value that is illegal but the services or products someone attempts to purchase or offer can be and that's what regulation needs to focus on.

Yes true but it does matter to the exchange rate to fiats.  If miners cashed out 100% that 3600btc per day is quite significant to the typical ~10,000btc generally traded per day at the moment.  That is unless of course nearly every buyer is a hoarder which could well be the case at the moment since these mining rewards are only going to get smaller anyhow.
@_date: 2014-08-15 10:29:59
All good points and I agree.
As for ideas on simplicity, here are some
- hide addresses by default? Allow advanced users to view these but they should be considered like ip addresses. Yes you can type them but will be rare on a mobile, most use a qr code or link.  Allow typing addresses as an advanced feature.
- '0 confirmation' notification, when payment is made pop up a message saying 'the bitcoin network has accepted your valid payment, this will be considered confirmed in approximately 10 minutes' 
- only sweep addresses (optionally extract only a certain amount from a paper wallet) to allow users to import private keys from paper wallets easily.

I think you're missing the point, the price someone is willing to buy at is purely the meeting point between supply/demand.
There is no 'a bitcoin should be worth precisely X' since it's just like any commodity, it's simply the lowest price people are willing to sell where the highest payers exist. Even if you ignore the exchanges this is true for localbitcoins which also include a premium.
To poke the fire a little more, I believe Willy was an automated way to purchase coins for large clients without dramatically effecting the price.  If MtGox was manipulating the price they did a pretty piss poor job at it since they should have been driving the price DOWN to purchase some very cheap coins to get themselves out of the pending bankruptcy.  
I'm certain spot price manipulation happens in the market by whales to create some waves but that's very very different to the average valuation where there's constant volume being traded.
If you're so sure you should definitely short bitcoin as you'll make a killing going against the speculative valuation.  My guess is you won't do it because your not 100% certain as no one can be.

Each word is picked from a dictionary of just over 2000 words.
That means the 12 word seed is actually a single very large base 2000 number.  To see the combinations that are possible it's 2000 ^ 12 = 
2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 =
 4.096e+39
i.e. the seed is a number between

Bitcoin being the first truly limited commodity that can be traded 24/7(which in itself is massive over other commodities) anywhere in the world instantly and without requiring a third party to facilitate it, this blurs the lines of currency and commodity.
Bitcoin is not really ready for buying your local coffee yet (technically possible but it's a clumsy at the moment)  this will become easier soon.
The main point is to realise your fractionally operated bank account is a virtual meaningless number to the rest of the world, it's is not backed by any limited commodity. That means if a bank fails, you lose any value rapidly. In the uk there is a  £60k govt protection which is a bonus over most countries but that's still only £ which is what the banks would devalue. If a Uk bank were to collapse the £ could get devalued so much that £60k might be enough to buy a rubbish 2nd hand car.
That's the point, bitcoin gives you an alternative to using a selfishly incentivised fractional bank to store and trade your £ and $.

A transaction will appear within seconds of being made.  You can use this transaction acknowledgement when the cost of it being fraudulent can be absorbed compared to the convenince of faster transaction times (e.g. buying a coffee).  The same is true for how cheques work, you can take it on faith the cheque will be honoured to instantly trade but if it's high value goods like a car you'd probably want to make sure the bank confirms it's accepted before handing the goods over.
The confirmation is only required to make sure the transaction is genuine and takes on average 10 minutes.  Something like an exchange will wait for 2 or 3 confirmations to be certain the transaction isn't cancelled via a double spend attempt for instance.
To compare this to banking, a transaction is made.  If they are on the same payment network it can appear within minutes to the other person's account... it is NOT however confirmed.  The confirmation I believe happens every 24 hours in a bank via the clearing house where banks settle their debts with each other.  This is vaguely similar to the blockchain's 10 minute confirmation system but clearly much slower.  I say similar because that bank deposit can still be pulled out of your bank account months later if the trade is contested.  Even if you pull the cash out of the bank account the following day, your balance is allowed to go negative so you must repay it to the bank.  This can never happen in Bitcoin's system so is safer but still need to weigh up the instant convenience vs the blockchain confirmation for absolute certainty.
For this reason, it's likely BitPay and the likes will offer a great service by giving a better degree of authenticity for small fast transactions, allow customer protection and consolidate small bitcoin transactions so less needs to be written to the blockchain.

Paypal is the obvious choice, alternatively ebay could oust paypal by just charging a posting fee and the traders exchange directly via an escrow 2 or 3 bitcoin payment system.
Let's face it though, if paypal don't adopt it people are unlikely to use ebay + bitcoin as it'll be clunky and will get usurped by OpenBazaar and other free peer to peer markets about to emerge.  These new market place systems have virtually no fees for buyer or seller, is much safer for both in regards to payment and can work anywhere in the world.
My hunch is Paypal are not going to want to be obsolete however so they'll probably be keeping up to date with this new tech too.

It's not bad for bitcoin but certainly artificially will lower the USD/BTC exchange price given they're making more bitcoin available to buy and not offering a service to repurchase bitcoin.  
The ecosystem needs this liquidity bitpay offer to scale and grow however the heavy one way approach could be improved.
I'd like to see bitpay and others offer merchants the option to retain bitcoin rather than always needing to exchange to fiat.
I.e. allow the merchant to put their own payout bitcoin address that they can select a % of the incoming payments is forwarded on to rather than 100% goes to the exchange-&gt;bank account.
Bitpay offer a great service for adding bitcoin payments to your website elegantly so can charge a small fee for this service.

Creating new addresses is mainly about security in not re-using a private key where the public key has become truly public.
Regarding anonymity, the history of balances can always be traced back (it's how you verify the funds aren't just created out of thin air).  That said for each transaction it becomes more diluted so harder to be sure who actually spent the coins which is the point.
Your point about all the source transactions must be under control of the owner is a good one and yes it does link them if you're 100% sure you know the sender of that transaction.
You could pay the fee and get all the transactions consolidated into one address to avoid this or go via a hot wallet/coin mixing service to make this analysis impossible to the public.

Not sure this article is too relevant to bitcoin, there have been many virtual currencies before and since bitcoin but they are fundamentally different to decentralized currencies.  
I like the distinction of a virtual currency being something which requires a central server vs digital currency which has no central server or control so can't be shut down.
It makes it very clear why Bitcoin and other blockchain based systems are very different from these earlier attempts which failed due to their centralized nature.  
It also brings into question if fiat currencies should be considered virtual rather than digital too.

Perhaps instead if bitcoin:??? Links we could also have

If you use your card abroad you pay fees with rubbish exchange rates for starters.
Secondly you obviously need an ATM to do the transaction.
My recent trip to Spain highlighted how even developed countries can suck for ATM access and even credit card accepting stores. You're ok in a city center but further out it becomes harder.
Not claiming bitcoin rivals ATMs yet but they've had many decades to proliferate vs bitcoin only existing for 5 years and bATMs popping up everywhere only in the last 12 months and already powered by many different companies worldwide.

It's identical to cash and has the same solution... Google wallet, Bitpay, PayPal and the likes... These are services and can offer chargeback for customer protection.  They charge a fee given it's their service offering on top of cash/bitcoin.
Best thing is it provides a layer of safety to these services as there's no chargeback/chargeback like you have with bank accounts ;)
So why bitcoin and not cash? My view is it's a global tradable commodity, fiat currencies need to be exchanged via 3rd parties first and they'll charge a fee. Also you need a bank account for those sorts of transactions. Finally it's now optional to use paypal and the likes for digital trades. I.e. You can now decide if you want to pay their fee for that service.

Not on the bitcoin network as the 10 minute target is one of the Bitcoin protocol rules everyone follows.  You could start a new digital currency and set the target confirmation time to 5 seconds but you'll probably find lots of forks and wasted work going on.
Transactions in bitcoin are instant, you don't need to wait for confirmation unless you need to be 100% certain that money isn't double spent. (I.e. a coffee is not worth waiting confirmation time, $100 is probably worth waiting the 10 minutes and $10000 is probably worth waiting the 30 mins for a few confirmations to be certain).
There are technical ways to get guaranteed instant transactions too.  Greenwallet.it does this because they have a key they co-sign a transaction with the spender and they won't co-sign a double spend attempt... i.e. you could use an intermediary to get instant confirmed transactions with bitcoin too.
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:56:45
Litecoin (and others) have done exactly this and I believe it works fine.
If we took it to the extreme of 2 seconds per block there would be so many blocks floating around it would likely cause many forks so whilst we currently only have to wait for 1-2 confirmations to be pretty certain it's accepted, in the 1-2 second confirmation time you'd have to wait for hundreds if not thousands of confirmations to know that your transaction is in what will be the longer chain which defeats the purpose of the confirmation times.

I find it amusing when people see interest rates of 2% or 3% on a savings account and think it's a good deal!  They seem oblivious to what inflation is and that their currency loses 4% of it's buying value each year... or put another way, those savings accounts are guaranteeing them losing at least 1% of their stored value each year!
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:21:27
Individual and pool miners are yes but it wouldn't do anything except make confirmation times slightly longer than 10 minutes until the next difficulty adjustment or until the attack stopped.  This would have to be a vast attack to make it even slightly noticeable.
Bitcoin protocol is extremely robust to this sort of issue.  People are more likely (and do)  target weaker points like centralised exchanges as that can invoke fear in the market to allow the attacker to buy cheaper coins and sell them as the price bounces back.  This is another reason why a decentralised exchange is high on the wish list for 2014.

no fork needed, the units of currency are not bitcoin anyhow, the base  units are satoshis and there will be 2,100,000,000,000,000 whole satoshis to share around.  
Because that number is just crazy to discuss he arbitrarily named 1 bitcoin would be 100,000,000 satoshis probably because the idea of 21 million is a easier to grasp for people coming new to the system.

0%. Sounds rubbish until realise inflation is another way of saying devaluing savings.  I.e a typical fiat currency has an annual inflation of around 2% so if the bank is giving anything less than 2% interest after tax you're losing value when compared to things like Bitcoin.

If he stole the money that is one thing, more likely is gox was hacked (perhaps many times) and he used customer funds in a fiat banking style approach to continue operating until the last straw came and he thought 'screw it' and folded the company.
What's sad here is he may go to jail only because he was trying to not close the company when it was bankrupt yet it's the hackers who have the bitcoin/money AND remain free AND still damaging bitcoin's reputation leading to a slower adoption.
Mark may have his faults like anyone but I seriously can't believe for one second he's blatantly embezzled it for himself, he was on a **great** earner with mtgox by anyone's definition so no need to commit a crime.  If he wanted a wad of cash he could have just sold Gox to someone else for a fortune so there must have been hacking/loss of funds involved here.

It's certainly interesting to probe new ideas and concepts but what seems to be proposed here is a central authority that issues the DC.
Your approach would offer the advantages to allow people to easily 'program' with USD or what ever currency it's pegged against.  It also allows low transaction fees and pseudoanonymous properties of cash.
Where I see major flaws in the plan that need addressing are 
1) It wouldn't be decentralised so hard to get people to adopt it.  It would probably only take off if the central government issued it or there was some interest/incentive for adoption.
2) For it to be decentralised the system requires relay nodes.  At the moment nodes are rewarded by mining rewards... you'd need to somehow account for this in your centrally controlled fiat DC.  Again possible but you'd need to figure out the incentives/controls in place.
3) It will actually increase bitcoin adoption as it would be easy to go from USD(dc) to BTC without a centralised exchange.  
Now you're talking on draining money from fiat systems if it's the central bank running it (i.e. could cause bank runs since most of the fiat money doesn't actually exist and is merely an illusion from fractional banking) and also enabling traceless money laundering.  This could cause the demise of this USDDC as banks like the ability to regulate/facilitate and monitor money flow.
Good work thinking of alternatives and their implications, I for one wouldn't expect to see a digital currency like this going mainstream when BTC and the likes already exist.

 I'm afraid non Americans will only encourage these proposals since it gives every other country an advantage in this important early stage. All us businesses will simply move their operations offshore and eventually the regulations will relax as it becomes apparent why digital currencies simply can not be nationally regulated like bank accounts.

@_date: 2014-01-10 00:03:18
it's about making sure new transactions are reviewed and certified by independent and impartial people where it tries to make it unlikely the same person reviews 2 or more 10 minute blocks in succession. 
It's one of the key purposes of mining. People who mine however tend to join pools these days to be able to receive a more stead revenue stream.  The issue is that these pools are essentially one person, this means that if the pool gets &gt;50% they are most likely to regularly get to be the person who reviews it so they can change the rules such as withhold payments, double spend items and issue themselves more coins than the 21 million limit for instance. 
I've grossly oversimplified and explained an unlikely scenario but anyone who gets &gt;50% is a serious potential threat that needs to be avoided.

I agree but put the caveat 'yet'.  Bitcoin still has many development stages to go through before a country could even consider this approach.
Firstly scalability issues need implementing.  It's been shown feasible but still to be written before mainstream adoption for currency usage.
Secondly, market understanding.  Vast majority of people still see bitcoin as a virtual currency like game money that has no intrinsic value or run by hackers or some other rubbish.  Yes, most here know this is merely ignorance at it's best (or we're all delusional :)) but the fact is people need time to understand why it's different for themselves.
Thirdly, timings.  It's only 5 years since inception.  Yes it's doing remarkably well but would be madness to back a country by such new technology at this stage.  It needs time to harden and mature generally, if a bug occurred that caused a hard fork putting an entire nations spending on hold is incredibly disruptive as the Americans demonstrated recently on their budget deadlock.

Have you looked into using a 3rd party that does allow 2FA on your transactions?  I.e. the blockchain.info / bitpay or others that may be able to help here?  Might be an easy first step to get you up and running quickly and then replace this as volume increases...
Alternatively you may want to take a look at coinb.in who provide some javascript libraries that allow you to do multisig stuff so you could just get your PI to talk to your server that does the transaction for you?  If you can't run javascript on the PI again the message could be farmed out to a nodejs server you control.
Another thought, you could just have the PI call to a another server that literally sends you a bitcoin payment request via email.  When you open this it opens your wallet to do the payment for you.  This is probably too much manual work but if you're talking about large sums or very infrequent transfers it may be of interest. (Thought would need to go into how you verify the transaction did originate from your PI such as signing the email message)
I'm sure others will have better ideas but thought I'd at least post a first guess response as it's great to see you making new tech in York!

It means we've reached a temporary equilibrium of people mining/supporting the network = just right for the exchange rate of Bitcoin.
It makes existing miners happy as a lower difficulty means more bitcoins they earn with the same hardware.
If the exchange price goes up those mined bitcoind are worth more so more mining power is put on the network.
If the exchange price goes down people have to turn off their machines and difficulty drops.

Interesting problem....
Is there any way that you and your employees can not have access to your clients funds?  From both client and service company point of view it seems the best safest approach.
Alternatively multi sig or fractional reserves with the remaining section in cold storage (although that still screwed gox over by the sounds of it).
Finally you could have a totally different machine just responsible for signing transactions and put some controls on that.  E.g. db verification, address verification before it signs a transaction for payment... probably going to be quite a bit of investment into this so if you do please make it open source and you may even get some helpers on it :)

You need to find an exchange in Lebanon/Dubai where people will sell their bitcoin for your local currency (Dirham?).
Localbitcoins is always worth a try if you don't know of an official exchange there.  Mycelium android app also has a local exchange system too I believe.
If doing it in person or via localbitcoins you'll need a wallet.
You can grab the best wallet for your phone/pc to transfer the bitcoin to by simply click ** in a browser and it will download the best wallet for the device you're using.
You simply trade your Dirham for bitcoin at the best exchange rate you can find... if it's an official exchange this should be very close to the US exchange rate otherwise there's money to be made!
Now you simply send these bitcoin to your family's bitcoin address and they can exchange them back to their local currency USD.  If they use a service such as coinbase or circle it makes life a lot easier.  Circle seems a fast and easy system to use in America.
I won't lie, I believe this process needs to be slicker and more streamlined but will just take time while regulations are worked out on exchanges and more and more businesses start seeing the opportunity of instant remittance transfers.
Please share your experiences on this here so the process can be further refined by any entrepreneurs out there...

There is nothing wrong with blockchain.info or reusing addresses.
We don't have quantum computers at home so the risk of someone theoretically deriving your private key from your public key is SO incredibly remote it's not a security risk unless you have 1000+ bitcoins stashed at a single address.
There's a lot of blockchain bashing going on right now and unfounded mob mentality.  Blockchain may have issue but are generally far safer than most exchanges out there and they are still incredibly good for what they do.  They offer a free service and some really helpful tools, I for one think they're still bloody good and happy to keep recommending them (and yes I'm not affiliated!)

I've looked into this as well, you need to do a production run of around 5000 cards to even be feasible.
It worked out that you'd need to charge an annual fee for each card printed which was in the region of $30 per card overall it just seemed like no one would pay this fee and would say it's a rip off so stopped investigating it at this stage.
Was comfortable writing the code to handle the back end of it all but only wanted to progress if there were 5000 pre-orders and xapo then came out which seemed to suffer from  what I was nervous about (people saying the fees were too high).  
Overall I think it can happen if someone has deep enough pockets to get it going but isn't something that's feasible for a startup without large funding.

Some suggestions....
Have a bit of script that emails you as soon as any source code has changed on your server.  I can pm the script if you'd like.
Second include a hash in your DB for all entries.
This hash must be generated by another computer and only done for rows without the hash already set.
The hash should be based on the fixed data in that row AND other data  such as the previous rows hash to make a local blockchain.
You can now detect any changes to the DB and it becomes very hard for a hacker to alter a single entry as everything is now linked with historical rows.
Have another machine automate test the process to detect valid addresses are used.
Open source it and pay for white hats that can prevent an attack vector spotted. 
Regular backups on another machine, encrypted rows, manually handling transaction signing etc... I think it's just about scaling security to popularity as can be a full time job keeping on top of this.
I'm sure there's loads more ways and better ones too, would like to hear what others do too.

Ultimately it must be a sustained attack to do any significant damage to credibility.   It is not in the mining pools interest to break the rules since they make their money from bitcoin, why would they shoot themselves.  If they were truely malicious they would do better just keeping everyone's mining earnings and run... even that hasn't happened.
The main reason I don't worry is there are far cheaper and easier ways of causing the same disruption a 51% attack could cause and these haven't been done.

Fiat believers are rarely enlightened, I mean how can they if they grew up in the system and know nothing better to compare it to and it's been secure all their life?
Most of us live in stable fiat countries unlike Argentina (once 8th largest economy in the world) or Zimbabwe who also have fiat systems but experienced the 'it'll never happen' disaster when fiat confidence disappears. History shows that fiat currencies eventually go this way,  
There is a very sound and valid reason that fiat currencies could NEVER have existed without the step before them of the gold standard or cowrie shells.  The idea of fiat is just stupid but only through slowly boiling the frog and moving from a gold standard does it seem somewhat flexible and sensible to move to fiat and the cycle repeats.
Virtual money, like fiat, only has value because enough people ignore that it's worthless but happy to trade work for it because others are willing to trade work for it.  Should that cycle be broken it's true value becomes apparent sometimes overnight.
Physical items like bullion and decentralized currencies like bitcoin are the only items that can truly survive a loss of confidence in a financial system since these are not virtual but a finite resource where ownership is irrefutable and globally tradeable.
Is bitcoin safer as a store of value for short term savings?  Absolutely not.  In 10 years however, if bitcoin is still in existence you can be pretty confident it's value is going to have performced vastly better than the 50% loss of value any fiat will have experience in that time based on a 4% inflation rate.
Who knows what the future is, but anyone who's put 100% of their funds in fiat or 100% in bitcoin is an idiot.  Diversification is the best form of security and if those fiat believers haven't put anything in DCs I'd be nervous taking their advice seriously.

Bitcoin addresses are very much like IP addresses of all the servers we use.  Whilst we can still type an IP address in a browser to get to the computer people usually use the domain name look up service.
The same is true for bitcoin except we would really need to trust the service that the short link is unmodifiable.
I've often thought that Namecoin is the solution here (or a derivative) so that you could associate a receiving bitcoin address to something like your email address.
Whilst it may work it's a lot of effort for little gain as rarely should you need to type in a bitcoin address, it's either clicking it/touching it/qr coding it/etc...

Any chance this was a double spend attack when you transferred them from blockchain to lb? Seems v odd someone can get past your 2fa on iPhone (assumed to be not jail broken) 
It actually is easier to compromise the lb servers than get ahold of the users dev cert, get the phones UDID, create a new Adhoc provisioning profile and install custom malware on their iPhone via usb and screen capture all remotely without the op becoming suspicious AND THEN pull off the heist at the same time as funds were sent to lb.
If he was that compromised they'd have just taken them from blockchain or downloaded their backup private key.
Perhaps the op has tens of thousands BTC and makes it a worthy targeted hack but in that case again it's easier to just find where they live if using lb.
So something is really fishy here.

That is very true, I've vastly over simplified it and didn't include these costs the miners need to recuperate.  It starts getting quite difficult to give an easy answer to this though as how long does one amortize asic hw over?  If it's like CPU-&gt;GPU-&gt;FPGA 2 years is about right but there doesn't seem to be much beyond 20nm ASICs so unless the mining algorithm changes or there's a massive step forward in calculating SHA256 we've reached a pinnacle of efficiency for a good number of years now (he says with wishful thinking :)) and just becomes about how cheaply can you generate electricity.

I'm not sure why people get hung up on this confirmation rubbish... it's not like we swipe our credit card and wait the 24hours for the bank to confirm the account hasn't gone overdrawn or that the buyer later calls the bank to say cancel that payment.
For small items such as coffee we trust the client they are not trying to rob the merchant.  The same is true for bitcoin, for small items we can instantly test if the funds exist in the account and that the transaction request has been made.  
The only way this can now be screwed up is if they try to double spend that same amount before the next confirmation happens and it's not trivial to do... technically possible but so is faking a credit card and probably involves the same skill level.
That all said, I don't believe Bitcoin is best suited for consumer micro transactions and something will build on top of bitcoin to address this, but for now it works better than any other system we have.

Explain the P2P blockchain idea and why it's the first finite digital asset that can't be copied.  This concept alone is worthy of an entire class.
Next I'd show them doing a live transaction from your phone and appearing in blockchain.info so they see how quickly it works.
Explain confirmation times to avoid guarantee against double spends and why mining exists (if they're cs students explain how not even all the super computers in the world mining simultaneously would make a noticeable difference in the mining speed supporting the network).
After that you can go into the guts of it if you'd really like like showing how to manually sign a transaction in bitcoind, eliptic curves, mining, etc..  and the tech around it.  My guess is the rest will bore them so would probably wait until they ask to know more about it.

That's the fun of decentralised systems, more than one thing can be done at the same time ;)  I tend to agree this is a worthless thread as there is no committee or consortium to approve these standards, it's merely what the majority of people start adopting.
My view is BTC makes sense and happy to use that.  XBT may make sense for traders, just like XAG does for them... I've never heard anyone talk about XAG before but have heard of gold so expect it's only necessary in the trading arena so XBT can happily co-exist.
I do like the idea of a unicode id for the Bitcoin symbol given it's become widely known.

Mining rigs do sha(sha(header+nonce)) where nonce is incremented in parallel in ASICs... Sha passwords are normally stored as one hash such as sha( password + salt text ). 
Ie I'm afraid mining rigs never find the perfect answer to get a hash of 0 which is needed for passwords.
To put it into perspective all around the world, all the mining that has ever happened i'd be surprised if a hash has even come close to 0 ever!  Even if it had, you'd still need to figure out the salt text from a single nonce value.  So all the millions spent on mining so far hasn't cracked even one password.
So to answer your question, it's an urban myth mining rigs can be even remotely helpful in password cracking.

I agree with you, if the private keys were compromised the absolute first thing a hacker would do would initiate a transfer... they're a thief after all so would have been their intention from the outset.
I simply can't believe Mark would steal these coins, there is just no sensible logic for him to do this.  He ran a successful exchange until this happened, why risk jail time for fraud vs letting someone else run your business and you make a rather tidy sum each month.

Agreed, I've already looked into doing exactly this and stopped because
- The fee's the mobile operator charge are prohibitive for a knowledgable bitcoin user.
- The system is very prone to misuse.  You can fake SMS's very easily.
- The mobile operator can refund the user but you obviously won't get your bitcoin back.
- You need to account for support, what if someone mistypes their address or sends a message saying 'change my deposit address'.  At this point you need a web portal and now you're back at square one as to why would you use SMS.

It's great that you show transactions of less that 1BTC, showing how they can buy 0.1 btc makes it far more accessible to people.
Also I agree about the history, it's interesting if you're into 'what is money?' but most turn off at history lessons.  Perhaps as an appendix note later in the pamphlet is better.  Most people new to bitcoin want to understand it in the 30 second elevator pitch.
- Why is is better
- How is it a finite resource
- Who can use it
- Where is it useful.
But overall a great job and we need more of these things...

I'm afraid Bitcoin does have fees, negligible admittedly but they do exist... right now these fees are one of the issues we need to overcome for 3rd world countries to accept it too.
Bitcoin is only a competitor to paypal in as much as gold and the USD are... PayPal offer a hot wallet service and include features such as consumer protection, redeipts, dispute centers etc... They hire people to manage this and try to make a profit, therefore they are a service company.  They should be able to use bitcoin just like the rest of us, whether they can offer a service for a fee that people want using bitcoin is surely the issue here.
My hunch is yes, right now most people don't know how to buy/sell their bitcoin for fiat and paypal can offer this service for instance.  Another is they can handle the micro transactions that bitcoin is not designed for (e.g. buying a coffee).  If they do decide to jump on board I'll use them if they offer a decent service.  My hunch is that someone's going to beat them to it however, bitpay and coinbase are looking pretty impressive and circle is talking about big things too.

I'd continue to look at the silver lining if you can.  Firstly what a story, this is something very few people would have done and it's interesting tale to tell people.
Secondly Bitcoin is still an early experiment, everyone's value could well go to 0 if there's a fatal flaw discovered (would like to be it's very unlikely but still a risk)

Not stupid, everyone here has gone through this and had similar questions and enjoy finally being able to help others :)
a 'coin' doesn't really exist, instead we just have balances held at addresses.  If you have the password (i.e. private key) you can send some or all of that balance to another address.
So to draw parallels to fiat banking
* address = a bank account number
* private key = password to spend the funds from that account
* X coins = account balance with 8 decimal place precision.

Mining doesn't mean they have the ability to create more funds, nor does it mean they can modify transactions.  25BTC will be created every 10 minutes on average regardless of who's mining and how quickly.
Mining merely resolves the order transactions come in and is a 0 sum game run worldwide, it would be a total waste of a governments resources to support the network with mining.
The only reason a government would consider attempting to mine would be to achieve &gt; 50% power to disrupt transactions but even that's a crazy idea since there are far cheaper and easier ways to subvert cryptos than using the very mechanism that makes the network stronger.

I agree but I believe the tulip argument is on the hysteria that happens around speculation of a commodity, not tulips as such so applies to gems, wheat, water, etc. 
Yes tulips argument is very wrong for bitcoin (and annoys me nearly as much as the ponzi line too) but people who are still learning can be forgiven in comparing it with mass hysteria as they are trying to draw parallels with things they've seen before so feel comfortable they understand it and can hold a conversation about it.
It's like people call bitcoin a currency or commodity, it is neither but just happens that it can do both functions so people like to pick one when introducing someone to it.  Won't be long before it's seen for what it is, a finite digital resource system perhaps, and needs to be treated as it's own. 
Our kids will get it and not need this reference but old cronies like us need to build on the knowledge we've come to trust and understand from the financial world before grasping why it's so game changing and far from any flower powered hysteria.

It's very safe to put your address anywhere to anyone.
When you spend funds from that address the public key becomes known that maps to that address.
This still is not an issue but it is now slightly easier (if that's the right word given it's still incredibly difficult) to derive the private key from the public key.  No one believes this to be possible yet but with quantum computing on the horizon that may help it's just a safety precaution hence why people recommend using a new address to store money in but it's not enforced.
Unless you're storing 100+ bitcoin's in an address I personally wouldn't be worried about it as it seems more healthy technical paranoia than any tangible risk yet.
Definitely get your saving funds out of webwallets, only keep your weekly/monthly spending volume in a web wallet just like you would with your physical wallet is the advice I follow.
So to answer your question... yes it's perfectly normal and safe to paste your bitcoin address anywhere on the internet.
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:14:47
Unless there is an irrecoverable bug found in the code, bitcoin will always have value.  Yes China is significant but it is also a minority in btc value as they've already scared off casual yen investors for the time being... most of the price drop is most likely from other countries playing the market on the back of stories only to purchase the cheaper coins later so expect the bounce pretty soon.  Market players make money with volatility so it's in their interest to cause some waves.
As digital currencies become more prevalent China will probably want to embrace them as they are incredibly good for trading with foreign businesses given their value is global and local fiat-&gt;btc-&gt;local fiat can be regulated/taxed easily.
Bitcoin's price is going to be incredibly volatile while people play the market given the small volume of coins circulating during this  speculation period.  It's incredibly difficult to purchase bitcoin and using them is confusing for the average internet user right now.
Both of these issues will be simplified and this is when it's true value starts becoming apparent.  If these are solved well the current valuation of less than $1000/btc is vastly undervalued as even just a store of value, the intrinsic value of transferring real value over the internet is difficult to foresee as we've never had anything like it so I'd hang on in there but keep in mind this is still an experiment.

Storing earned value is typically done via banks these days due to it being perceived as more secure and more convenient than shoving dollars/euros/pound notes and gold bullion under your mattress.  When the banks fail due to a bank run people start trading in cash or other commodities like you say.
If they use euros they will be returning to this mattress approach to avoid these banks hence returning to the risks and inconveniences that banking solves.  What's different is bitcoin can now do this banking for them, i.e. store and transfer earned value but is entirely outside of the banking world.
The massive advantages of bitcoin are
- It doesn't have to be physically hidden, a password is all that's required
- Isn't just 'on your computer', it's anywhere with an internet connection as long as you have that private key.
- You can access it anywhere in the world and trade with anyone in the world instantly.
- It's value is constant in regards to the share of the 21 million units available, the more people use it the more each share is worth.  Yes it wildly fluctuates compared to fiat right now because not many people use it and there's a lot of speculation but this will eventually settle and fluctuate far far less.
- There is no storage fee in keeping your stored value unlike other commodities.
- It doesn't deteriorate like other assets
- It can't be forged or quantitatively eased by a bank or government.
Btc does have some serious usability issues still to overcome (security, easy of use) , this is not a problem with Bitcoin but the software that's currently available for it... it's getting better each year and will see some exciting things this year to address it.

Here's a bitcoin address you can tip if you'd like, 1NoA98grVfXfVqysU4ijM9jhMBD8vmrUC8
No way of stealing these funds though.
Regarding online wallet security, yes it's tricky right now. Multisig, debit cards; time locked and hardware signing like Trezor all help and I'm sure more are on the horizon. Lloyds of London already does bitcoin insurance for companies that can show they have security in place so that should put your mind at rest of this being an Achilles heel for adoption.  Remember the tech is only 5 years old so security will take time to catch up now there's financial items worth stealing on computers.
I'm not saying bitcoin will take over the world, but there's no denying the technology is vastly better than anything we currently use for financial transactions.  Consumer use will be v slow to happen for the reasons you say but stronger money historically pushes out the weaker one so is set that  digital money will surpass localised fiat currencies unless something even better comes along.

You're right that this is way too raw but draw a parallel to the computer for a moment...
In the early days everyone had to develop programs using pen and paper jotting down numbers.  It was hideous!  People still bizarrely got excited by them and tried to convince friends and family to share their excitement, not because it could add numbers quickly though but because of the bigger potential they could see it will have.
  
We're at this visionary stage with cryptos, using them right now is a pain in the ass yet people are excited because it's only the tools that are difficult but the implications for now having a decentralized currency are vast.  In time bitcoin's usability will rial that of banks and cashmachines but with not much more time they will go well beyond what our current experience is with trading.
I get excited due to the many ideas it opens up for everyone and I'm sure someone out there has more usable ideas for good security than just rolling dice ;)

There are many reasons other people can list with our current understanding but what is exciting is what we haven't even thought of yet.  
Bitcoin is a technology and economic enabler the world has never had before.  You may have heard this phrase "it's much like asking why do we need computers or the internet back in the 80's" and is a bit cliche but nonetheless true as it's obvious with hindsight computers and the internet have had a dramatic impact for the better of humanity.  In fact, these days it's hard to imagine how difficult it must have been for people like Turing, Watson and the likes to explain why this so dramatic because people hadn't seen it's use yet.
So I guess what I'm most excited about is not that this 50 year old decentralized global commodity problem has finally found a solution (which in itself is amazing), it's more that we have an excellent protocol for new ways of trading that enables some amazing innovation we will now start to see happening.
For instance, no longer do people need bank accounts to trade... even your pet cat can have an account.  We can trade instantly around the world on a level playing field.  We can perform escrow and other contract style exchanges we're simply not used to with fiat banking.

good question but importing your private key to electrum...
**ITS A TERRIBLE IDEA I'M AFRAID, DO NOT DO IT!**
I imported my private key and get terrifying notifications from blockchain.info anytime a payment is made and that address is touched for payment (words like your $1.50 transaction will notify you your entire balance of say $-280.00 has been spent)
That's the first problem.
The next is you've compromised your blockchain.info private key, should anyone get your electrum wallet they now have your blockchain.info money too.  All eggs in one basket and that...
The most serious issue is you've now undermined your 2FA on blockchain.info.  This means if your money gets stolen you won't know what's compromised.
Finally electrum is deterministic, importing your blockchain key could lead to weird issues like all your funds get removed from blockchain.info and end up in a new address in electrum outside of blockchain.info's address thereby making future blockchain.info spends impossible until you manually transfer funds back to that address... in short it's a real pain in the ass as it's not clear where the change goes to!
I did it, I regret it, I recommend sweeping rather than importing :)

Good video.  May I just add one thing on security.
Bitcoin is incredibly secure, more secure than even cash.  It does not suffer the security issues we encounter on debit and credit cards where anyone with your card number can withdraw funds as often and as much as they'd like and yes it's the merchant who pays for the theft, not the card company.

Should mention it's best to make sure you don't save your private key on dropbox or any other sort of shared medium (email, etc..)  Bitaddress is the safest way to do long term storage as it's not saved anywhere on your computer and you can set a password on your private key.. that said it's more hoops to jump through to redeem it in wallets like multibit and bitcoind.  Blockchain.info is the best 'online' wallet and they look set to be around for a long time but if you're storing for savings I'd always prefer offline paper wallets as you know it doesn't rely on any site existing in the future.

I'm afraid I disagree a little there, they're actually making bitcoin stronger.  We need places to accept bitcoin as this is exactly what gives them value.. they're tradeable for goods and services.  
If they buy something with bitcoin and don't repurchase (i.e. just extracting value from the economy) this is lowering the exchange price of bitcoin but in time this will become less of an issue as more people continue adopting it.
If this happens too much my concern is you have the media jump on it saying 'the price is crashing, it's doomed' which we all know is nonsense but will delay mainstream adoption as people are scared off during downward trends.
It's just about getting a balance and these early days too much one way or another could really effect the price.
I think you have a valid point about the exchange price but equally we just need to encourage people to repurchase the coins if they want to help stabilize the exchange price.

A few points of why bitcoin is better
 * You don't have to pay anyone to store it
 * It can be easily subdivided
 * It can be transferred to anyone anywhere in the world instantly
 * It has a built in escrow system if you want
 * It isn't as bad for the environment to mine.. no mercury vapour going into air or water supplies.
 * It has a predictable quantity available at any point in time.
 * It can't be faked
 * It is a vastly more precise way of measuring value with 8 decimal places of accuracy without purity issues.
 * It can't be confiscated
Without sounding too biased, Gold does have a few advantages over bitcoin too.
 * Gold is more useful when people don't have access to the internet
 * Gold is more widely known so it's value is more stable at the moment
 * Gold looks pretty and can physically hold it
 * Gold may be easy to lose but it is hard to physically destroy.  
 * Doesn't require any computer knowledge to use.

I'd look at using a private key encrypted paper wallet.  If you want to do the n-of-m thing just put this encrypted private key through Shamir's secret sauce...
You can specify how many parts of the code you need to decode it.
You could also send it to a multisig address with instructions to each person on how to redeem it but will let someone more knowledgeable about that give that response as I've yet to actually try this myself.

When setting up merchants, if they need to take bitcoin and convert to their local fiat bitpay seems the best bet so far.
I created an AutoFwd link for simplifying it as people want minimal steps.
For a merchant get an android or iOS tablet and click   this will download the appropriate app for that device.
For a wallet on a phone use 
This will download Bread wallet on iOS devices, MyCelium on Android and also supports BB, WP8, PC, Mac and Linux devices too.

"which both generates the codes for individual bitcoins..."
It's the pictures of a physical coin that seems to perpetuate this notion that bitcoin is an atomic tagged unit with clever maths behind it.  It's a pity as the explanation of it being a simple plain text balance held in this shared decentralized database that only needs a password to spend it is pretty easy for most to grasp.
I got confused by this at first too hence why I have a bee in my bonnet about it... without knowing this people don't realize how you can have 0.0001 of a bitcoin in your wallet or that a wallet is only storing the passwords, not the actual bitcoins so you can spend them from anywhere in the world.
Yes, I know it can do more than these simple transfers but for a new person to understand bitcoin it will probably help answer a lot of their questions.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:48:50
I too have thought about this and couldn't find a fair way of reversing transactions but perhaps it is possible, NXT have exactly this sort of voting feature in their coin so seems reasonable to consider it in btc.
My thoughts were more along the transfer to charity approach so that stolen coins will be deemed worthless to a thief. Yes the owner of the coins doesn't get their money back but the thief loses the coins too so would only be invoked in rare situations and provides a disincentive to stealing.
The issue is if the thief spends the coins at a genuine establishment before the reversal , this would mean that establishment gets robbed 'because of bitcoin' which no one wants.
Also coins may be orchestrated as stolen by a high profile pr stunt which again would weaken the solid protocol.
An alternative is to have a blacklist of spendable addresses, this means &gt;50% miners would have to sign up to this scheme for it to work. With this coins can become unspendable because miners ignore transactions using these as input addresses. 
This may well become a target during international regulation that by law miners must use the blacklist... We are a loooong way from this as governments are only just understanding digital currencies are here to stay and still learning the tools available to regulate it.
If this regulation is heavy handed or unfair mining just moves to a country or tor node which doesn't have to adhere to it so miners must want to participate in it rather than being told to.
Interesting problem nonetheless...
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:24:23
There are already some good replies here but if I can just clarify to help.
An address can be thought of as your bank account number, the private key is merely the password to spend the funds from that account.
A wallet contains ONLY private keys.  From a private key you can derive the public key.  The address is a hash of your public key... i.e. it's your public key mixed with some error checking and a little bit of info taken out so you can't derive a public key just from it's address.
So the order is private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address.  Hence why your wallet only needs your private key.
The difference between this bank analogy and bitcoin is that when you spend money, all of the funds at any address/bank account are fully consumed and the total is divided up to the destination addressses.  What this means in practice is if you had 0.1btc in an address and spent 0.02btc you'll get 2 outputs.  1 output goes to the person you're paying 0.02btc to, the other is your change (0.08btc).  This change could go back to your original address however for extra security it doesn't, instead a new private key is created, added to your wallet and the change sent to this private key's address.  The reason for this is your public key is exposed when you spend from an address... now it's still very safe but it is in theory possible to now try and crack the public key-&gt;private key relationship if you were incredibly dedicated and knew a weaknesses in the elliptic curve cryptography used.  I.e. it may be safe now but in 20 years?  This is why addresses are used since we don't even know the public key to try and crack.
A satoshi is the smallest unit of accounting and can't be divided any further, i.e. it's a whole number/integer.
"1 bitcoin" merely refers to 100,000,000 satoshis.  I expect it was picked because every 10 minutes 5,000,000,000 satoshis were created for a miner and talking these vast numbers is somewhat overwhelming hence was called 50BTC instead.

I've been working on making a site that detects your platform and can offer redirects based on this platform.  I did it for my apps I create but keep being asked 'how do I use bitcoin?' and now I just say 'type  into your browser and it will get the best native wallet for that device' (*I know there are other amazing wallets out there too, no disrespect to them just out of the ones I've tried these seem very good)
The AutoFwd link downloads MyCelium for Android, BreadWallet for iOS, Electrum for PC &amp; mac.
The new user just needs to type this URL in on the device (or scan the QR code/NFC) and it'll take them to the appropriate appstore.
Clearly for technically savvy people they'll google/research and pick their own wallets in time but this is merely meant to simplify it for people who just want to try it.  Would be good to hear if anyone else finds it helpful and/or what else they'd like.

It's great you've written this, you probably know but there are a few misleading things in there though.
* "These transactions are encrypted using Cryptology"
Transactions aren't really encrypted, they are indeed signed which is just a number at the end that proves that the transaction was made by someone who owns the password/private key for that account but everyone can view everyone elses transactions without any 'decrypting'
* "Bitcoins are produced by the developers"
This is not quite true as anyone can do this and rarely are developers who contribute to the bitcoin codebase.  
Bitcoins are 'created' by simply adding to someone's balance a specific number of bitcoins in exchange for them helping in the process of verifying everyone elses transactions. The amount they get credited is very carefully worked out and is a major reason of why Bitcoin is so different to any other digital currency. It is a system that fairly picks someone at random with the chance of earning the new coins based on how much they helped the network over time.  These days specialized hardware is required so isn't viable to earn coins via mining without investing a lot of money up front.

Altcoins are rubbish for this at the moment, stay with btc.
These systems need to be easy to use, buying and selling bitcoin is already arduous but vastly easier than lite/peer/NXT etc.

This is a good reason to regulate exchanges, whilst this is clearly a joke it could genuinely exist in future.
If exchanges in each country insist on knowing who they do business with, these funds can be tracked and authorities informed when a withdrawl is made. It also means all related emails can be linked for the pending case.
That's why I'm pro btc-&gt;local fiat exchanges being regulated.  Any further regulation at this stage is not going to work IMHO.  
Later I can see an authority containing a 'funds from suspicious source' api that wallets can use to alert users they are being paid with tainted funds.  
This authority could be decentralised and vote driven, so creates a global community approach rather than a single superior agency open to corruption... Or am I dreaming.

There is no price manipulation here, regardless to what mtgox may or may not have done.
If you want to buy bitcoin it costs $580 because that's what some people are willing to sell at and some will buy at.  You think it's overpriced? Try buying it for $500 right now and you'll see no one will sell at that price today on any exchange or local trade.
Equally there are people selling at $100000 already but no buyers at that price as that's insane too. 
Hence $580 is the true equilibrium and is very accurate otherwise they'd be massive arbitrage going on until the price was corrected.
This is 101 trading,  tin foil hats are useless here.

Not sure I follow.  Proof of work is intended to be that not one person has more than 50% of the computing power in the network, if they do they can start changing the protocol such as creating more than 25 coins per block reward for themselves... 
We are generally past this point however as the amount of computing power on the network is bigger than the top 50 supercomputers all put together so very unlikely an individual or organization could muster this sort of sustained power.  
So to answer your question, proof of work means your chance of being selected to receive the newly minted coins every 10 minutes is (you hashing power/total network power)... so if you have a fast computer you've got a better chance of being the first person to find a solution to make those coins.
If there was no 'proof of work' at all there would be nothing to enforce the protocol rules as anyone could just append anything they like to the blockchain.
Not sure if that answers your question but hopefully it helps.

This is bollocks... if you don't want them publicly associated to you just create a new address and transfer them there and pay your dr that way.  
No one can possibly know it's you unless you do something illegal and your house gets raided where they find the private key for that new address in your computer's depths during the investigation.
Tumblers however are a very very bad idea and I agree with the hearing that they so far are only used for dodgy purposes (anyone else still remember that heist that went down in December??).  When people believe they are truly anonymous from everyone they act in incredibly bad and selfish ways like stealing, hiring dodgy people, (downvoting in reddit ;)) etc... There are numerous psychology experiments that show precisely this if you think I'm just making it up.
I for one don't want to encourage a world like that.  Yes I believe we should be innocent until guilty so I like bitcoin's pseudo anonymous setup where your transactions can't implicate you but if someone hires a dodgy assassin that person can currently have bitcoin used against them in a court of law when they're found to be the private key holder from where the funds were transferred.  If coins were totally untraceable however??? Shudder.... Just imagine your savings are stolen, you now have nothing, and I mean literally nothing... the police and anonymous community wouldn't care as hey it's anonymous and there's millions of anonymous people out there who may have your stash now.  How is a society (i.e. group of people clubbing together) supposed to function?
TL;DR?   Tumblers aren't needed for legitimate purposes in my opinion, bitcoin's current setup is anonymous enough for the innocent until proven guilty approach most want.

Bitcoin itself is still proving incredibly resilient and secure, (edited) people lost coins simply because they sent their coins to someone else to look after and they got hacked/lost them.
It's helped strengthen the ecosystem as now more and more sites and wallets try not to actually hold your coins.  It's new for all so there's going to be growing pains along the way and as to why people keep buying them?  Keep in mind that bitcoin as a protocol is still working perfectly and is a true finite digital commodity, that probably answers your question.

Thanks for the links and heed the advice however the article appears misleading so perhaps you can correct me as I'm fairly new to cryptography.
The article mentions randomness is used in the signature which I've never heard of, I've never seen (or can see how) this is possible with a pay to
public key hash op so expect the author was doing some hand waving/simplifying the issue?
The weak rng issue, like you mentioned on android, I believe is because the seed used to generate the random private key is weak/not random, nothing to do with signature randomness or a weakness in single address use. Ie you can reproduce these private keys if you know how to reproduce the 'random numbers' or what set it is restricted to.
 This issue is relevant for a single address but surely equally for HD wallets too but perhaps I'm mistaken?
Go easy on me as like I say I'm still learning and I certainly have never researched the rng issue but I'm yet to see why address reuse is dangerous.

New reddit - fair enough.  better safe than sorry.

The fact you've responded makes me believe you a little more but there have been many of these stories in the past so you can understand why I am somewhat sceptical.
Posting your transaction is safe, all transactions are public anyhow and has no linkage to you or allow others to spend it.  It does however show how much you have so don't bother if you're nervous about that for some reason.
You don't need to demonstrate it to anyone unless for some reason you want to prove this is genuine... I'm a person who you'll never meet, makes no difference to me if you have 0.001btc or 10000btc and honestly just not wanting people to waste time on yet another scam post.

You're right that it lowers price and we should be encouraging the 'buy back bitcoin' to users to keep the price stable otherwise adoption will slow as people see what may appear to look like a death trend to 0 (obviously this won't happen unless there is a fundamental protocol flaw yet to be discovered)
That said the most important thing now is to make wallets easy to use, they're all horrible at the moment with qr codes, transaction ids, confirmation times and addresses shown along with all that sort of programmer crap all over it.  None of this info should be relevant eventually but we are all still excited by the protocol that the underlyings are exposed to people who don't want to know about how it works.
In a nutshell we need a wallet that my 5 year old could use and show my gran why it's great.

It's pretty easy (once you've set it up and look back at what you've done), you just buy an asic miner and run CGMiner or the likes on the host and point CGMiner to a pool address you've setup at somewhere like BTCGuild to begin with.
This is fine for the smaller machines you can buy off ebay however very soon the next gen of asics will be out and everything currently in use looks like it will cost more money to run than it generates (at current prices) so not even be a break even exercise.
If you invest in the more expensive/faster miners you'll really need to use p2pool or the likes, it is harder to setup but not that much more.  If you are investing in these faster products (100Gh+) make sure you research the company, there are far too many scammers out there or won't deliver fast enough.
With more and more hardware hitting the network it will soon cost more in electricity than it generates.
With that knowledge you can speculative mine on the belief that btc/usd value will rise however you're better off just purchasing btc directly if this is what you plan.
I.e. only do mining if you're wanting to see how it works for a hobby, don't do it if you're trying to make a profit would be the general advice you'll keep hearing.
Best of luck with whatever you decide!

If it helps, I've found bitcoin has other benefits too..
* escrow systems (E.g. buying a car or other large sum purchase not done in a shop where you normally need to take a wad of cash)
* Invoicing people abroad (I issue all my invoices with a bitcoin option as it's far far faster than a 3-4 day bank transfer and cheaper fees for both)
* Donations/Tips/Services/Repay people.  It's safe to put your address on the internet, people can only send money to you, not withdraw it.  Banks and credit cards can't do this.  PayPal does but they're limited by banks ability to fund too.
* Will be a better alternative to travellers cheques as more ATMs pop up and the rates come down.
* Savings, to avoid the average 4% drop in value of fiat each year.  Yes it's a high risk investment but no more than investing in any 5 year old company.
* Enabling autonomous agents so your computer can earn and spend money for you to make your life more convenient. (From automatically swapping service providers to get the best deals, ordering you a taxi to get home or sharing your storage space for a fee)
* Provide a layer of anonymity if you ever wanted it.  Adult services are clearly one avenue but also purchasing a surprise gift for someone or supporting or endorsing someone or something without fear of being associated to it. (e.g. in an oppressive state where you're not allowed to speak out about something)
* Allow direct selling like OpenBazaar or ebay to become more financially viable and safer for merchants.  This is probably going to be the first killer app we see of bitcoin imho.
* It gives the world an agnostic currency that is for the first time truly fungible. Vast sums can be transferred without interference and on common ground.  
Bitcoin is never going to replace fiat but I do see it being vastly better than fiat for many things especially on the internet.  You're absolutely right though, the world seems to be waiting for the killer app to appear to get over the apathy but given we're only 5 years in on digital money with an explosion of enabled ideas I'm certain it's just around the corner.

Bitcoin and every fiat currency are almost the same now, merely numbers in a database.
The key difference is who controls the supply and access to that database.  If you ask how much money there is in a country you have to consider M0,M1,M2 types... i.e. there is no clear answer for what should be a very simple question.  In Bitcoin the supply is done by a mathematical algorithm so is very predictable and gives the finite upper limit of 21 million units ever to exist.  Access to bitcoin is by anyone or anything that has the password to transfer funds at their address.
What it solves is it allows value to be stored or sent over the internet without relying on any 3rd party, especially a 3rd party who's purpose is to make money for themselves.  The effects are profound and will only become apparent as more applications start appearing (it's only 5 years old and playing catch up with decades of banking consumer goods).  For simple examples look at btcjam for crowd funding loans.  Also search for Mike Hearn's talk about the automated taxi... a decentralized taxi is vastly more efficient than one run by a company but that sort of progress is only possible if we have digital currencies as the idea a car has no owner but has it's own bank account is just bonkers until you embrace DCs like bitcoin.
In a nutshell, Bitcoin allows anyone to write or use software to send real value over the internet to anywhere in the world.

You're right, I didn't answer that as I don't honestly know.  I'd guess it's psychological so that the system is seen with a limited supply.  As Luke-Jr mentioned (and was new to me) there were only 2 decimal places shown to begin with so gives some credibility that it's purely a perception thing to show that it's a finite resource.  Let's face it, most people's eyes light up when you say they'll never be more than 21 million in existence.. probably won't get the same reaction with 21 quadrillion.

Mining is just a way of randomly selecting someone on the network every 10 minutes that has said they're willing to verify the ledger...  That randomly found person verifies the entire blockchain and for their hassle they get +25 bitcoins credited to their nominated bitcoin address... nothing more to it really unless you want to understand the clever bit on how it does this in a trustless way.
Every 4 years that reward is halved so sometime in 2016/17 the rules/protocol states only 12.5 coins can be awarded to themselves.  If the miner breaks the rules the rest of the network merely ignores them.

Interesting but keep in mind the exchange price should have very little impact on it's usability as a currency.  A buyer purchases btc using local fiat, the seller flogs bitcoins back for their local fiat and all should happen in minutes.  Right now buying btc is cumbersome and needs to be faster for most users (Circle is the exception) however merchant side the conversion is already happening this quickly so no impact to them.
The exchange price should only be useful for storing value or speculating.

Correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is they would be able to change the protocol if they get a majority of the hashing power and can maintain it (i.e. &gt; 50% ongoing and not just a peak).  
This is exactly why we get hard forks happen because two versions of the clients disagree about a technicality in a block and if it's valid or not.  
If someone gains &gt; 50% hashing power they can do whatever they want such as mine more coins that the set 25.  Yes everyone else's full nodes would reject these blocks but they are now in the minority and can't see how the lite clients could not accept these dodgy new coins?  Bigger sites like mtgox, Bitpay and the likes probably run full nodes so they'd be covered but for everyday shops and individuals on their phones (and not using an online wallet like blockchain.info), I think they'd believe that miner (and anyone they've paid) has as much money as they've printed.
Now as soon as the malicious miner lost that &gt;50% advantage normality would be restored and their chain and dodgy blocks would be dropped by everyone so everything would become a moot point but whilst they own this power I can't see why this isn't possible... I'd love to hear it is impossible though!

Firstly back up that back up if you haven't already as USB drives are dreadful long term storage ;)
In answer to your question, a backup from your wallet will have all your coins and any future coins that have been sent to your address.
BUT if you have been spending funds and the change has been returning to a different address your backup is only good for 100 transactions after that backup.  After 100, you will lose all previous coins when restoring from an old backup.
Two solutions are
1) make sure you keep your main address and don't use new addresses on each spend for the change (less secure as your public key is now known) or
2) regularly backup the wallet.
Happy to be corrected if I've misunderstood this but I believe this new address for all the change to go to is how most wallets work now.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:08:46
This would not be an issue if they waited for a confirmation to verify the transaction occurred, they're claiming they don't do this yet so allowed people to withdraw an amount multiple times if someone applied this difficult to implement hack.
It is a minor bug that should be fixed at some point but doesn't sound that serious at all unless you're gox and been targeted with it.  
People will panic sell until they realize it's only related to mtgox and that they'll be fixing it very very quickly.
I'd like to believe MtGox will issue a statement that it's business as usual soon as many people are scaremongering about their stability but this is just them protecting their cash while they fix their vulnerability to the exploit.
Again this only explains btc withdrawls being temporarily stopped, they haven't explained the fiat backlog which may also be interesting but guessing it was just a lockdown while they figured out how money in - commision  didn't equal  money out.

Mining pools only accept valid hashes and reject everything else.  If you spam it you'll be banned.  Spamming can be detected as a pool uses the same technique bitcoin does to prove you're actually doing the work...
Bitcoin says do a hash on the block header (+ your random nonce value your hammering) and if the numeric value of this hash is less than a certain value it is the winning answer and valid.    
For simplicity here let's say a hash produces a number between 0-1,000,000 and the blockchain will only accept a block header that hashes to a value less than 100.  I.e. every nonce change/guess has a 1/10,000 chance of being valid.
What a pool does is say actually I'll accept hashes less than say 200,000 not the 100 that the blockchain is looking for.  i.e. it will accept 2000x more hashes than the blockchain would accept.  
Each time a miner finds a valid nonce value such that the block header hash is less than this target of 200,000 it can submit it to the mining pool.  The mining pool verifies your submitted hash is valid and you're awarded a 'share' for your work.
Now statistically every 'share' submitted to the mining pool has a 100/2000 chance (5%) chance of actually being the winning hash but it makes sure each miners are doing real work.
These numbers are obviously bogus as there are many more digits involved and mining pools accept millions of shares but used this to demonstrate how the system can't be gamed.

Great idea and good start.
The opening statement seems rather techy...
"Bitcoin is much more than just an alternative currency. It enables you to store, send and receive money without any third party (like a bank), it's issue is not controlled by a central bank, but rather a mathematical algorithm that cannot be altered without the consensus of over 51% of users, and it is much more difficult to counterfeit than gold or pounds sterling. " 
I expect this will only appeal to technical people.
How's about something like...
"Bitcoin is much more than just an alternative currency, it is a finite digital resource that can not be created or counterfeited so can only be obtained via trading with someone else.   It is vastly more secure than debit cards and bank accounts for online trades by design.  It allows you to store, send and receive value without any third party involvement such as a bank or company's involvement, i.e. it is equivalent to gold but in the digital world.  The bitcoin balance you control can be converted back to any currency via the many exchanges available where they match your buy or sell with others wanting to sell or buy some bitcoin. Here's how to do it in the UK..."

I think they are onto something but probably like MySpace was, they definitely are pioneering!
My main concern is they go on about it being Turing complete and lots of hand waving but they don't have a simple 30 second pitch as to why it's compelling.
Spending a bit more time on it I believe they are onto something but it just seems overly complicated or too visionary perhaps ... Or rephrased I couldnt see the immediate problem it solved that needed solving or that bitcoin can't already do.
My guess is there will be a v2 and v3. If I had spare cash I'd invest a bit but it's ultra high risk in my mind.

I agree with teknorath... blockchain.info is excellent for this by the sounds of it.
There are 4 clear ways to consider which is most suitable for you.
1) If you don't care who's sending you the money like a donation page you can have a single payment address.  This can be generated by any wallet, electrum is pretty highly regarded for this or the actual bitcoin reference system.
2) Use blockchain.info.  They will give you a unique pay-to address to show on your webpage and finally forward the funds on to your own wallet address.  This allows you to identify who's paying what from your cart but will require PHP/nodejs skills.
3) Use a payment provider like bitpay who will give you a link and handle taking payments for you.  I think the bad part about bitpay is they'll pay you in fiat money unfortunately, they may have a way to take bitcoin payments and forward it on.
4) Write a custom solution using bitcoinjs or your own server... probably overkill if you're talking a single webpage mind!
I have to admit, I wish there were pages on the bitcoin wiki page talking people through setting up bitcoin enabled carts as it would really help adoption.  (And with and without using 3rd party payment processors I mean)

The only reason Apple won't support bitcoin in their payment systems is because there isn't enough consumer awareness/usage yet.  This may well change if bitcoin continues its currently adoption rate.
I don't see Apple payments as a competitor to bitcoin as it doesn't offer anything a creditcard already does.. it merely simplifies that physical payment process. 
It's like they have invented carbon fibre and made a carriage for a horse to pull where as bitcoin is more akin to the invention of the petrol engine.  The two could work together if they wanted.

You can, check out greenwallet.it is one that does exactly this for instance.
These prevent double spending attacks since they're required to sign your transactions too and won't sign a double spend.  Also if they know who the receiving address is you know it won't be a double spent transaction incoming.
Double spends however are really not that big of a deal (correct me if there are examples where people are heavily out of pocket due to them though), if you're trading for something with a large value you just need to wait a mere 10-30 minutes for at least 1 block confirmation to be 99.99% sure the value is certainly yours and incredibly large value just wait a couple hours for ~100% certainty.

That's a bit into the deep end, you normally never see your private key(s) and it's handled by the wallet you use.
If you use something like blockchain.info as your online wallet they allow you to download your private key for safekeeping should their website disappear.  This has been the only way I've heard people getting their funds stolen from blockchain.info because they saved it in dropbox or some other location that was compromised.
If you're using your PC/mac you probably will be using Multibit, bitcoinqt, electrum (I've not used this myself just heard people rave about it).  These wallets store your private keys in their data files (typically something like wallet.dat on your hd).
You should back this file up regularly and put it somewhere safe (write to a CD or put in a truecrypt folder) on some other hd.  The reason you need to do it regularly is that EVERY transaction you make it creates a new public/private key to send the 'change' to.  A backup stores the next 100 addresses it will be using, if you do more than 100 transactions you're now sending your funds to new addresses where you don't have back ups of the private keys.
Mobile android/ios wallets will have their private keys stored locally on the phone at a guess.  iOS coinpunk is the best I've heard of and I believe you can back up the private keys for this but don't quote me on it ;)
Finally cold storage.  Using something like bitaddress.org you can create a paper wallet and this will show you both the address (a hash of your public key) and the private key itself on the right.
To redeem these later you can import a private key to blockchain.info or into multibit/bitcoind.  (The process is u-g-l-y for the multibit one the last time I tried as you have to create a text file and copy/paste shyte around).  I hear blockchain is pretty good for this though.
If you do use a paper wallet one, make sure you use the password on the private key bit and print out at least a couple copies in high res.
So generally, yes private keys are used to generate the signature for the transaction and if you have the private key(s) of addresses you can spend funds from them, but for most users we never need to deal with them... just back up your wallet.dat file regularly if you don't use an online wallet.

Not quite, if you are storing bitcoin for long term storage you should print out a paper wallet from bitaddress.org or the likes.  This allows you to put a password on your private key too so only someone with both this private key and your password can redeem/spend them.
If it's for daily spending, hot wallets like blockchain.info or coinpunk.com are excellent and again as long as you remember your password you can spend them anywhere on any device, not just on your computer.

If you mean to change it's value, not really.  If you mean for readability it can be done by the viewers/websites/etc... these can work in different denominations such as mBTC or uBTC or Satoshi's (actually this is the only unit bitcoin uses, but we say 100,000,000 of these makes 1 bitcoin for readability).
So 1mBTC = 0.001 BTC
1uBTC = 0.000001 BTC
1Satoshi is ... you get the idea ;)
There was a movement to get everyone to use mBTC when 1BTC=$1000USD for simplicity so if this becomes the norm I'm sure we'll be talking in mBTCs instead of BTCs.

Yes you're right, it was an early stage approach to making sure XCP was fairly spread around.  
There is no mining in XCP (that I'm aware of) so everything is premined and they needed a way to fairly distribute the counterparty bitcoins (XCP) around to everyone who believed in the project from the outset.
I see it as a one way side chain ;)  
This early proof of burn was only for the very early investors so the only way to get the limited XCP now is by trading with other people on BTER and the likes.

Please consider setting up an AutoFwd link for your iOS/Android apps so you only need to give one short URL for both.
Also it would be excellent to have a sweep private key option as giving a paper wallet to someone is a nice gesture but it would be even better to allow them to easily import those funds to their mobile wallet ready to spend.

"A wallet is a computer file which holds Bitcoins. Bitcoins are sent between wallets; each is represented by one or more addresses."
Would it be easier to relate this to the banking system people are familiar with?  
E.g. bitcoin balances such as 0.021btc are stored at bitcoin addresses.  Addresses can be thought of like your bank account number.   You can have any number of 'bank account's called addresses.  Each address needs a password to spend the funds, the wallet is a file on your computer that stores these passwords for each account.  It's therefore important to backup your wallet file regularly.
It took me several days to understand there was no such thing as a coin and the press still gets this wrong, it's merely an account balance and the currency is called bitcoin.

You're right, bitcoin isn't consumer friendly and people don't care if they use a bank or not... at least not when they have a trusted govt and access to banking.  I think we're lucky in regards that we don't worry about that but 2008 was a bit of a wake up call that we're not immune to devaluation fiat.
'Bitcoin is vastly better for financial transactions', currently we have
- Gold or other precious metals.  They have been around for a long time and is limited and can't be replicated.
- Paper currency backed by a central bank.  This is great for local trading inside a country, illicit purposes and pocket money.
- Bonds/Stocks/etc.. great to invest in companies and countries to help them thrive.  Usually generates some good interest too.
- Digital Currencies.  Accessible anywhere without having to physically carry anything if you've got a really good memory, transfer instantaneously anywhere in the world, any value can be transferred for a very low fee, can not be physically destroyed if handled correctly, ability to create escrow and smart contracts, ability to color coins to prove ownership of physical goods, can't be quantitatively eased, allows sharing a deposit location with peace of mind to name a few, instant balance checking by anyone, anyone and anything can accept funds and transfer value now.
Each has their own strength and just like the newspaper vs internet debate we can say newspapers are great at chip shop wrapping, pinata making, fly swapping and ass wiping as well as sharing information with the masses but this doesn't seem to be enough to prevent more and more people using websites to read about world topics.  
I believe we are starting to see the same thing with financial transactions and yes bitcoin clients are U-G-L-Y at the moment but these will get better and is why I still believe DCs are vastly better than any other financial transaction system we've seen before.
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:09:14
I agree, direct blockchain transactions may be best to be made a rarity in time... always possible by people if they really want but typically for day to day spending many will want 'consumer protection/chargeback facilities' for purchases hence why paypal, bitpay, visa, etc can offer a safe layer above the blockchain.  This will greatly reduce the bw needs and bloating the blockchain with unnecessarily small 0.25$ transactions. My take (and happy to be convinced otherwise) is that direct blockchain trades should be more about moving sums of money when &gt; 0.1% of your earnings which also help pay to maintain miners in future to keep the network secure.

I've heard this argument many times but it occurred to me it's the same as flogging a phone on eBay, payment can be refunded after the goods have shipped so it's just about trust and reputation of the buyer.  As long as the seller can leave negative feedback on a buyer who rips them off its a pretty good system to allow people to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-22 10:05:13
I hear you, I'm talking about drawing a parallel in that at some point the bank needs to balance it's books and this is done far less than every 10 minutes... I'd heard it was a long time but didn't know it was twice a day.
I believe you can have $100 in your account and spend $100 in America but at the same instant someone else can spend $100 of your money in Australia.  Eventually you'll be deducted the $100USD + $100AUD from your account and now you're got a negative balance, agreed overdraft or not + fines.  Checking on your online bank balance is unlikely to show you these two transactions have happened within 10 minutes, in fact perhaps within a day from my bank's experience.  
The key difference being bitcoin eventually only accepts one of those transactions if there were insufficient funds to cover both.
So can it be improved? Yes.
Does it need improving now?  I'd say not, at least not urgently, the number of people who would even attempt a double spend is pretty small and if anyone is really worried about being out of pocket they can wait for 1 or 2 confirmations to be certain it's transferred successfully.
@_date: 2014-11-24 10:31:23
One of the laws of Bitcoin is it aims to get a confirmation every 10 minutes on average so integral to the protocol like you say, there are however ways to do it faster.
1) Firstly transactions happen nearly instantly so payments can be done and recognized instantly on the bitcoin network.  The confirmation is only needed to prevent a double spend within that confirmation time.  As an equivalent a cheque has a confirmation time of weeks, or a credit card around 6 months.  Therefore confirmations should only be important when you need no trust between parties and the exchange value is sufficiently high.
2) Once sidechains appear, faster confirmation via an alt chain could happen.  A dedicated microtransaction alt coin may well appear out of this.
3) A third party can offer instant confirmations because multisig is used and the third party ensures the funds are not double spent.  Greenaddress.it I believe offers this already and I'd expect we'll see a lot more in time.
PayPal could own this if they grasp the benefit and move fast enough before someone like MC/Visa/Bank realizes they need to step in quickly to avoid losing market share [edit pressed save before typing the last part]

Why do you think they'd be lost?  If Gox has been subjected to fraud where someone is stealing their coins they haven't been destroyed or left the economy, merely just aren't owned by gox any longer and will be from gox's profits.  There's no way they'd not notice money in &lt; money out for long given it's what the entire business is about.
If Gox miraculously did go insolvent and still had any coins they will have to liquidate them to pay their debts so again they'll return to the economy probably through a private sale. 
I'd like to believe they have locked down btc and fiat withdrawals as they noticed the internal accounts weren't adding up correctly and needed to find where the leak before allowing any value to leave the company.
Explaining it's because they base their transfer funds on the txids has bought them some excusable time for why they have had to lock down as the developers may not have been aware of this so all they knew was money was vanishing somehow.
Must be stressful to work there at the moment as it's a fair amount of coding and testing needed before it's robust and safe to launch.

I'd suggest JavaScript since you already do HTML which makes it very complementary.
Means you can write client side parts easily and pick nodejs for the server.

Try bitaddress.org to print out an address on paper and send them to this(try a small amount first to be sure you're happy with it!) or an easier way is to use electrum and just write down the 12 word seed you're given.
With that 12 word sequence you can install electrum on any computer, type in those 12 words and have access to all your coins.
The electrum approach is probably best to do on a PC not (and never will be) connected to the internet if you're wanting to keep them super safe.
Paper wallet approach is best for ultimate security but importing the private key is a pain in the a** later.  I'd only use paper if you're planning on storing them for years.

blockchain is merely a ledger of all transactions that have ever happened... it's merely an ever growing file.  The file is added to every 10 minutes on average when a miner is randomly selected from around the world who has verified the ENTIRE blockchain plus the new transactions from the last X minutes since the last miner verified it. These new transactions make up the block of verfied transactions that gets added to this globally copied blockchain file.   Scanning the blockchain you can view the balance at any address that has ever been used.
That's it in a nutshell.

Your boiler can now have a bank account. Crazy idea yes, but here's a contrived scenario... You purchase a boiler that has logic in to dynamically pick the best fuel supplier every day.  You pay the boiler to heat your house and each month your boiler asks for its allowance to keep it going and saves a bit if money too. It uses this money to pay for the fuel it uses and can email someone to fix itself or service it to remain efficient, again searching the open bazaar for the services.
There's no AI here, this is just a script the manufacturer programmed so the boiler is a no hassle boiler that will always work, is efficient without needing a middleman taking their cut.
Now someone on benefits or pension could have their boiler paid directly by the state, no risk of misused funds.
Inefficient boilers can replace themselves as better versions come along or when it knows it's about time to be replaced.

There are ways to improve it.. I believe the 9 (or actually 7 was what I'd heard) was due to the size of the blocks being limited to 1Mb.
The block size can certainly be extended to up this if needed but brings other considerations.
There are most likely way it will scale is by making microtransactions (like buying a coffee) offchain are handled by intermediate payment facilitators like bitpay/paypal/visa etc.. these guys then only need to hit the blockchain when funds are added or withdrawn from their systems.
Bitcoin is not intended to offer consumer protection chargeback facilities or merchant tools, it's the raw irrefutable transactions so services need to exist on top of bitcoin too.  What Bitcoin does incredibly well is replace bank accounts and commodities as a store of value and global payments can be made instantly.
If a company doesn't enter the micro transaction space there is an opportunity for a side chain to take this market too but I've yet to see one that can scale to thousands of transactions a second yet but is certainly just a matter of time.

You're right.  It's all about electricity fees from now on... those with cheapest electricity bills will be the ones that survive.
That usually means those who have access to geothermal or other free electricity or running the most efficient mining hardware.  Everyone else is buggered unless the BTC/USD valuation goes up.

A high end miner takes around 10x the energy a server takes.  As for how many miners are in action, eventually it's easy to work out, this is the block reward * fiat currency value = 25 * $800 per 10 minutes or 3600BTC x $800 = $2,800,000 of electricity per day.

For the benefit of others curious (as I was), XBT appears to come from trading precious metals and the likes.  All these start with an 'X' so XAU would represent gold, XAG for silver, etc.. The 'X' is to denominate it's not owned by a country and given Bitcoin is modelled as a digital gold it seems a reasonable fitting ticker symbol for traders.

There are a growing number of merchants accepting bitcoin but equally you can trade it for any currency around the world.
It's a store of value like a commodity (albeit a very volatile one as it's still very young).  In time they could be used for many more purposes but the ecosystem is still growing... all you can be sure of is there'll never be more than 21 million.
Just a note, the wallet only stores the private keys (i.e. the passwords) to spend the bitcoin balance stored at your address(es).  The bitcoins themselves live in the shared bitcoin ledger that all miners and companies use and why bitcoin is unique and not a virtual currency but a digital one.  Just wanting to highlight that as long as you know that password you can spend your bitcoin from any computer anywhere in the world instantly.
At the moment bitcoin wallets vary greatly but the best wallet can be found by clicking on  which detects your system and gives the most popular wallet.

It's much easier to grab the coffee and run out of the shop.
A double spend has to be well orchestrated to happen within the same block time at two different stores AND use a wallet that 'ignores' this double spend issue.
E.g. you could have an accomplice both of you using a mobile wallet sharing the private key to some funds.  The transaction is handled by your own bitcoin node/server (a hot wallet like blockchain.info or coinbase wouldn't allow it).  Now you both make the transactions at the same coordinated time and wham a double spend where one shop will lose out.
So yes it is theoretically possible but takes effort to do and given the person won't be allowed back in that shop again the value has to be high enough to warrant it.  This is why you wait for confirmations for higher value goods.
I should point out though that many ATMs are not 'live' and allow you to double spend as well... not to mention cheque books are insanely easy to double spend with yet shops still accept these for convenience.

A typical supercomputer consumes 4MW, a 1THash machine consumes 1kW.  Therefore the network is using in the region of 160MW of electricity say, or 40 super computers.
So yes it's a lot but when compared to supercomputers it's far more efficient and when compared to general computer usage it's a drop in the vast ocean of wasted energy with servers, home PCs and games machines constantly left on or in standby.  Just put a power measurer on an Xbox or PlayStation and put it in standby to see what just how much they draw even on standby.
I do like the idea that cryptocurrencies provide a very significant financial drive to come up with more efficient energy production systems so it may bizarrely work out as a benefit to the environment...

TLDR; 
Bitcoin miners are probably exempt but as I understand it there's been no guideline on wallet developers yet.
I had a discussion with a bank just today where they said I'd be liable for laundering if I facilitated a transaction to say Iran.  I explained that if I didn't hold the private keys so couldn't have authored that transaction and merely published it on a node for someone else would I still be liable for the transaction? They believe yes which I strongly disagree.  
So I next asked if the user published that same transaction themselves directly to a node, who is liable for their transaction? Me? The User? The Node?  The browser? The ISP? Even the chip manufacturer??? If I were supposedly liable for simply forwarding a user's transaction previously any of these could be liable.  Clearly common sense says it's always the individual and this is what bitlicense may help clarify if well crafted but I'm nervous they may miss this subtle but important point.  Time will tell...

This is tinfoil hat grade A bullshit I'm afraid.
Firstly most programs that pick the random number for the private key do not use just the RNG on the chip, if they did that software is at fault, not the chip provider.
Usually they mix in entropy from things such as mouse movement, hashes of passwords, time, etc... all of this would mean even a RNG that just produced the value '1' everytime would still give solid and safe private keys.

Am I the only one that thinks the US is missing a trick here?  Given they are selling the bitcoin they could launch their own exchange site.  
This way the agencies have full clarity on who is buying/selling them as they can put in any KYC rules needed, they could limit it to a US audience if they want to keep the value within USA, and they can charge tax on the purchase/sale of coins.

People are being a bit harsh on you here but is because it's a common misconception. You don't need to wait for confirmation unless it's a lot of money and want the certainty like a cash exchange over say a usual debit card exchange which is possible to game. Chargeback are possible for small instant amounts but equally most people are honest and most shops accept debit cards even though these take months to clear.
Other approaches like greenaddress also show instant confirmed transactions with Bitcoin. 
The issue is, if this was a real issue there are already solutions that fix it but most don't see confirmations as that important for small transactions.

This title is wrong!  He is actually quite positive about cryptocurrencies but rightly mentions most don't know how they work.  It isn't on their radar yet.
"However, exchange rate losses can quickly cancel out this advantage."
This part shows they haven't made the mental leap why bitcoin holds global value and over time it is likely this issue will erode.  You'd think the fact that the value correlates precisely in line for USD/GBP/EUR fiat currencies 24/7/365 and not randomly volatile for each fiat would be the light bulb moment on why they should be looking to embrace it.

Please reconsider writing yet another SR related article.  You're absolutely right that digital currencies and bitcoin are vast subjects, the white paper alone is 12 pages and that doesn't even touch on the social aspects of 'what it does' which is an incredibly interesting and exciting question.  Focusing any time on the fringe/small illicit uses where DCs were used is like writing about the internet in the 90's and saying it's main use is for cats and porn... i.e. they'd totally missed the point of what the internet was potentially to do to society and why so many people were really excited about it.
In short you have so many things you can touch on that are vastly more profound, each topic alone could put you over your 4 pages so I'd just pick one or two to focus on.
* Transfer value instantly anywhere in the world, remittance.
* International Corporate accounts, settlement and tax issues.
* No inflation/devaluing any stored value.
* NASDAQ/LSE could become obsolete almost overnight if bitcoin goes mainstream.
* Escrow transactions without needing a 3rd party company.
* The first global currencies that if adopted prevent forex rigging due to arbitrage (see the banks that have just been fined).
* No passwords required on websites, your computer can simply sign a challenge question on every website it visits to prove it's you
* Decentralised loans with no banks required
* Autonomous agents, this has profound implications in itself.
What I'm saying is, embrace this challenge as you've got a great opportunity here!  Anyone could squander this with a narrow minded article based on past work done by people who didn't really research it beyond it's minority nefarious purposes but you're in a position to write a new vastly better article you can look back on in 5 years and be proud you spent the time doing the research and see what all the excitement is really about.

Clearly this technology is here to stay and still growing ever stronger but talking about transaction volume, businesses adoption, new potential and real financial inventions on the horizon only enabled by bitcoin are all rather intangible to the public especially when compared to a dropping exchange price... but you're right, I've tried to explain it so the rest is up to them.

Proofofexistence.com is probably best place to see it in action.
Essentially you can append a little bit of custom data onto the end of a transaction.  This is typically done by taking whatever information you want to prove existed at a specific time and hash all the data together to get a single very very big number.  You can now append this very big number as an extra attribute in a transaction (essentially it adds the code OP_RETURN which means all the information in the transaction after this operation gets ignored but the data is included in the blockchain.
Now if you want to show with irrifutible proof that document existed at that time you can give the document to anyone, they can hash it to get this big number again and simple search for the number in the blockchain.  (These numbers are so vast it's virtually impossible to get a duplicate number in case you're curious and certainly can't reverse a hash back to a modified document)

I think you've hit the nail on the head regarding the microtransaction channels.  Bitcoin is just not very good for this, it would drown in transactions if this was the case.

You can already see what 1 btc trades for in YEN, GBP, EUR, Gold, etc..  none of those have any influence of the USD forex rate. It's why btc can be considered the first global commodity.
If USD collapsed it would mean 1 btc will get you a lot more USD, just like if you had 1 oz of Gold you'd be able to sell that for more USD notes.
That said if USD lost global value we'd probably see BTC valuation go up as more people invest in it especially since there are not any major US based BTC exchanges yet.

At the moment it is doing that due to lack of a better substitute, problem is all currency has its worth in comparison to speculation of its future value. Ie if the US was to default on its debt (as nearly happened a few months ago) people would rather own yen, euro, gbp which suddenly effects everyone around the world. If a currency's value is described in relation to a finite and predictable resource it adds a degree of stability especially for uncertain times.  
So my take on it is btc is like an international digital bank which you could use for any transaction but in practice these transactions are mainly to top up your fiat for daily spending depending on where you live and allows the tax systems around the world to continue to function well meaning countries can embrace it.

A double precision float has 52 bits for the fraction part which gives the ability to be 100% accurate on the integer number range of
+/- 4,503,599,627,370,496.  
If you look at that as Satoshis to bitcoin values you'll find a rather convenient number of
45,035,996.27370496 BTC can be perfectly described with no rounding errors.
Now why 21 million?  So the mining algorithm does 50 btc each block reward and this is halved every 4 years.  This figure halves every 210,000 blocks so 50 is a round number to begin with, if 100 was picked however it would have put it (edit) very close to this 45,035,996 threshold but for some reason he didn't... it might just be for safety to avoid potential overflows but I really don't know about this.
It seems clear that Satoshi thought 4 years was a good stepping duration to get headlines,(perhaps due to many gov elections being held every 4 years but that's me speculating with a tin foil hat) 10 minutes was a reasonable confirmation duration to balance forks vs certainty which therefore gets us to that magical 21,000,000 btc.

because once you spend from them the public key is exposed in the blockchain so should bitcoin's ECDSA ever become compromised someone can deduce your private key and take your funds.

No, this is not what ASICs do and there is no advantage in compromising them, whatever that would mean anyhow.
Even if there was, most of these chips are not produced in the US but China and Sweden so is vastly more political if they tried.
The controllers however could (and therefore should assume are compromised) but so what... all they do is relay on public information anyhow, seems a lot of effort for no gain.  
The better approach would be to imagine something people are doing that may be against your beliefs, now how would you compromise that?  
If you're wanting to disrupt bitcoin used in nefarious ways the easiest approach I can think of is to create a bitcoin company that offers an incredible service with easy and instant on/off to local fiat, perhaps integration with existing payment systems like visa/mc/amex and offers market beating fees subsidized by the belief owner for what control they get in return.  
Now you own the market with this system, it would allow you to track most of who is spending what as you only need 1 side of the party to be using your uber system.  You can serendipitously modify things if really important (like oops, your account must have got hacked and lost all your coins,) for example.  Keep doing that too many times and people will cotton on but used occasionally it gives a contingency 'Prevent a person/institution from sending money as a last resort' feature.
There's probably other things too but this is the obvious approach I'd look at

API just means a set of rules/standards to communicate with an application, be it on a server somewhere or running locally on your machine.
So for bitcoin the API may be to talk with a bitcoin program running on your computer or an API may be used to communicate with something on a server such as an exchange.
A server is easier to understand as typically most APIs are implemented via URLs. 
For instance typing try clicking bitstamp's ticker method via typing this in a browser...
it returns just the raw text of the latest prices that you can now use in your own program.  You can now use these values in your own program.
Bitstamp have made this API so people can do functions on their server such as buy/sell shares or get the latest order book.
In addition to their regular url API they also have a websocket API which is just another way of querying this streaming data in a more efficient manner rather than effectively pressing refresh every 30 seconds.
An API typically has an implementation made in the language you use to develop in, called libraries, so you'd find for instance bitstamp has a library for PHP, C, Javascript, etc... that knows how to talk this API.

It just means we'll face an 8Mb block limit hard fork question again in a few years... that will be even scarier to upgrade since if it is approaching that size it means the price will have gone up and a hard fork would be far more serious for market confidence.
An algorithm of doing max blocksize = average blocksize over last year * 2 or something seems more sensible to me.  If blocks do start getting too large/used as attacks more stringent limits can be easily reintroduced without causing a hard fork.

Segwit is a new type of transaction that solves a lot of issues and allows for a lot of new features to be added more easily/safely.  
To name a few things it does... segwit transactions reduce the amount of space needed by the main blockchain as the witness data that can later be discarded is put in a separate data structure.  
Segwit transactions also solve malleability issues which is a serious headache for developers building ontop of bitcoin.  It also allows for future expansion of new features such as making bitcoin truly fungible which needs to happen at some point.  It also makes the Lightning Network that is in development are much cleaner solution.
What they are saying is the number of computers running the full bitcoind client that is capable of understanding and issuing segwit style transactions is over 50%.
The marker for it actually being usable however is the number of the mining nodes supporting segwit (i.e. bitcoind clients but they are actually running mining hardware), this needs to be &gt; 95% before segwit transactions can be activated to be safe but this is still stuck at 23%.
Guess what OP is trying to highlight is that most users are keen on seeing SegWit approved but the miners are still holding off.  I don't know why they are holding off adopting it but I guess they have their reasons...

I think bitstamp didn't want to be associated with a small business that was sending random payments abroad.
I'm sure it is legit but for Bitstamp this is small fry and not worth the risk they expose themselves to for opening a business account that is essentially a faceless entity abroad that could quickly disappear.
Not saying it's right, but they're under so much scrutiny they need to be active in showing they are making difficult decisions on ambigious tax situations.
Equally they didn't close your personal account, you got understandably angry and "vent typed" which is never works expect in the movies or memes. 
IMHO the best approach is signing up to an American btc exchange to obtain the bitcoin for your company to later pay your contractors.  At the moment, you're mixing your financials with the company and this is a big no-no.

Just to point out that the card info is not safe hence the "CVV2", 'verified by visa' SMS checks and all other measures they have to make.
Digital currencies like Bitcoin mean you push your funds to them so you send only what you want to send so shouldn't require the same sticky plaster security measures we've come to love from credit cards.
The security measures needed for bitcoin are likely
1) a secure secondary signature system like greenwallet.it or a hardware system like Trezor.
2) On a mobile phone you can link it to the phone's security like finger print recognition, face recognition or GPS deltas.  We're talking a second or two to make a payment once these are implemented and no typing in the numbers needed.
CC, ApplePay and visa could also adopt the same thing too but they seem to have missed a trick by keeping it as a centralised payment system.

As I understand it there are a handful of people who have write access to the main bitcoind git repository who can pull suggested changes made by anyone into the main reference client.  Anyone can branch, suggest changes/submit pull requests as it is open source but only these few people decide what goes into what is the original reference client codebase line as a line of sanity.  We're not under any obligation to follow what they do but usually a good idea as they're some rather smart cookies.
Anyone can branch and make their own bitcoin version but if you're a miner it's vastly more important to make sure you're following the majority to avoid losing out on the mining rewards if you end up mining on a forked weaker chain.  As the first miner upgrading you're taking a risk unless you know others will be joining you in the update.
For this reason the 'core devs' out of courtesy are highlighting technical changes that are needed that would create a hardfork for peace of mind for the miners.  Eventually forks work themselves out as no one wants to be mining the weaker chain and miners are normally technical people understanding the impacts of the changes but with enough lead time and sufficient consensus a hard fork is likely to be avoided.

Let your friend work it out themselves, only explain it if they ask.  People hate being lectured.
You could explain to him if he's so confident it's a ponzi/bubble/etc.. he can short it and make a fortune.  I.e. borrow 100 bitcoins from people from places like btcjam.com, sell them for local fiat $ or whatevers and repurchase those 110 bitcoins in a years time.  
If bitcoin is a ponzi repurchasing 110 bitcoins will be vastly cheaper in future so any difference is pure profit for very little effort.
Whilst people do short bitcoin, many don't short it for such a long period of time as they've taken the time to study it to know it's not a ponzi and such a move would be gambling.

Paypal charges 3.4% + 20p per transaction
Ebay is ~10%
Also OpenBazaar and the others offer digital escrow so unlike ebay where the buyer can say 'didn't receive this' and the seller loses everything, this is avoided now since both the buyer and seller have an interest on the deal working.
Finally ebay doesn't allow services.  This means if you want to sell say graphic design skills you can't advertise on ebay.  Enabling this allows for autonomous agents and other new concepts to become feasible.

How's about starting a remittance service for businesses. For instance I'd be up for being American and UK counterpart.  Company A sends you money locally, you send me btc, I send the american/UK company the funds locally within minutes.
(Probably best to use Escrow for peace of mind)
We both take a cut of 1%, pay our taxed and everyone's happy :)
I'd feel more comfortable doing this for companies rather than individuals.
Probably needs lawyers to make sure it's all legal but seems a way to undercut banks as I'd expect their exchange rates and fees are far worse than 2%??

It's a free market, the exchange price is simply the price a trade was done at in whatever exchange those websites happen to pick.
The two you have picked are coinbase and bitstamp exchanges respectively.
There is a discrepancy in the value at different exchanges based on a number of factors.  Typically if the gap is big enough to warrant the fees there is an arbitrage opportunity to make easy money.
Ironically, the part that makes it difficult to do and have such a significant deviation is just how slow the traditional banking system is in transferring funds.

They are probably not creating a bitcoin transaction per trade (or if they are this isn't actually necessary and part of their R&amp;D they'll discover).
Instead they simply hash together their own block(excel spreadsheet even) and put this single hash number in the bitcoin blockchain as the proof.  This way it's possible to verify the NASDAQ ledger hasn't been tampered (which is their main reason for using it in this scenario) and still have their database held on their own servers so not needing to make it public domain if they didn't want to.
They clearly will need to spend bitcoin every block to tag the hash number in but we're talking probably $0.10 per block perhaps or $15/day to use this fortified database.
If it works it may become standard that all stock exchanges and places requiring proof of records use the same approach and bitcoin would easily still easily cope with up to say 1000 exchanges world wide right now without any changes or other jiggery pokery.

I don't get it... assuming mining has reached it's equilbrium of price vs electricity costs (which I doubt it will have) the next halving will simply mean 1/2 of the mining equipment gets turned off... worst case if everyone made the choice on the same day to turn off their machine a 2 week adjustment will require 4 weeks with block times averaging at 20mins instead of 10... after the readjustment life will continue as before.
That seems the worst case scenario on the halving I can foresee, the more likely one is the price will rally shortly after as btc inflation drops from 11% to 4% due to the halving and that pricing rally will allow the miners to turn their machines on again.
Who knows the future but that's my take on it if that gives another perspective.
@_date: 2015-05-09 10:48:37
Interesting idea and you're probably right that something like this is the right approach for bitcoin in the long run but is a big ask that wallet providers keep a copy of their utxo's to transmit... seems more work than just slapping more RAM in.  Perhaps there's some middle ground where dust transactions could become centralised somehow.

If they're that confident tell them to put their real money where it matters.  They can get a bitcoin loan from BTCJam, say borrow 10 bitcoin with the loan repayment to complete in a year.
Next convert the 10 BTC to USD for $5000 that goes into their bank account (coinbase, circle, etc..) .  In a year just repurchase 10 bitcoins to repay the loan.  Simple.
If they're right bitcoin will be worth far less (say $1/BTC for instance) so only cost them $10 to repurchase all coins to repay the debt netting $4990 'real money' profits.  
You may help point out that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to short commodities and they may like to consider why others aren't doing this and perhaps it's worth taking it a bit more seriously.

Yes, I believe that's all you need.  Find another clean safe PC to install multibit on and check you can see your funds there before wiping your old machine.
You could equally send all your bitcoin to another address you own such as a cold wallet (bitaddress.org) or on another device but shouldn't be necessary if you're merely wanting to move the same wallet onto another machine.

wallet providers can probably offer this information.  I'd expect most mobile wallets have statistics built in via services like Flurry that consolidate the information as anonymous percentages.  If any of these wallets could post up their geographical usage percentages someone else could simply extrapolate with country population/world population to get the % of users in each country using bitcoin...
Question is will any wallet provider share this info as would make an amazing graphic showing adoption.
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:51:30
You lose access to your wallet?  You probably lose your funds in it if you've not taken steps to prevent this.  This is an issue that needs to be resolved for consumer level adoption as most users are pretty relaxed about security and redundancy.
If you do post your cc and someone did something nasty with it the onus is on you to prove you looked after these details... since you'd have posted the details to the public you're not covered so you wouldn't get your money back I'm afraid.
To be clear, if you did get your money back you probably would have potential criminal charges looming due to putting in a police and insurance claim where you obviously hadn't mentioned you'd posted these details meaning you committed perjury.
Credit and debit cards, of some description, should continue to thrive as they are useful for daily transactions in shops and they can easily adapt to support dc's if they wanted to.  Actually they'd do well offering a dc for online payments in future since the current setup is so insecure but we'll wait and see.  The key point is these payment providers now have a viable alternative to a bank and a race has started to see who does it first.

It's not surprising, this is a significant sum of money you're converting to a government's fiat currency so the exchanges absolutely must make sure they're being correct and proper to not facilitate money laundering and essentially do good book keeping.

I thought this too but someone explained to me how if you haven't moved the coins for a long time you don't need to pay any transaction fee at all for it to be completed.  It's just all the wallets seem to have a default min transaction fee regardless to coin age to ensure your transaction is accepted, the network however doesn't require the fee if they're old enough and you're transferring enough value.
Bit at the end shows the details...

Forgive my ignorance here but firstly I thought there were some obscene number of private keys meaning it would take the duration of the universe with all computers working on it etc... to find all the possible public/private key combinations?
Also if this is somehow a full list, how are anyone's funds secure?  Surely someone could just look up mtgox's public key here to get it's private key to extract all their funds. I realize that when you transfer funds the change goes to a new address so the public key isn't visible yet but seems pretty easy going from address-&gt;public key in comparison to public key-&gt;private key.

I was about to say moving parts are bad but if we're going to need to get the 20Mb blocksize to be 80Mb in the following 4 years I'm actually all for it as a hard fork when more people are involved later would scare confidence for the newcomers who really don't want to know about the underlying technology.
Something like Max size in Mb = 200 * 1/Blockreward perhaps?
Or if we want to be a bit more methodical about it, take the average block size from previous reward time period and make this * 16 + minsize (1Mb) (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 for the 4 years ahead)  This way the system will adapt by itself.

Absolutely agree, PayPal's future is bright and strong with or without btc becoming mainstream... they offer services like chargeback, integration with most banks any major payment gateways around the world.  Having them accept btc would be by far and wide a win/win/win situation for users, bitcoin and paypal so regardless to if the sentiment was sincere I welcome PayPal to the btc world.
My experience with PayPal is that they're not the bad guys, it's actually the sucky leaches in society who do charge back fraud once they receive their goods on ebay that are the ones causing the grief.  Now using bitcoin escrow system goes a long way to solving this that paypal's system can never do due to the company liability in a dispute.

Most wallets are created and designed by programmers as the tech is still low level.  To get a better desktop client a couple things need to be done...
1) An experienced designer needs to understand bitcoin and put up a design for a better wallet.
2) A programmer(s) must be willing to adhere to the design to bring it to market.
I believe most are done because people believe in bitcoin and are doing it not for profit, unfortunately people need to earn a living so we need funds to get people working on this fulltime.  Projects like Lighthouse sound like a very interesting approach so that we can see professionally developed products where developers and designers can do it as their job.

As an individual entity anywhere on the planet the internet facilitates trade to happen beyond borders, Bitcoin now allows that value transfer agnostic of nation.
If nation A produces a digital coin you can see how they could insist all businesses and national transactions be requested to occur with it but what about outside of A?  There is no incentive for another nation to adopt another nations currency, in fact there are excellent reasons why it would detrimental to do so. 
 Bitcoin already has global value and if there is a global value entity already in existence you'd have to ask yourself as an individual with free choice, which do you see being more tradeable in the future?

Not sure I follow, I don't think I mention merging as such?  Imagine there was a catastrophic oversight with the 20Mb branch the solution is to either fix it (thereby probably creating another hard fork) or roll back to an earlier version which would prune the chain from the first block that exceeded 1Mb.
If you're referring to the hashing algorithm changing due to an incredibly unlikely mining threat occurring, I believe this is possible since there is a version number in the block so would just require incrementing this so payment providers know which chain to follow.

Are you certain you've lost the coins and not done something like transfer them back to coinbase or blockchain?
My multibit wallet scares the crap out if me on every transfer because I imported my blockchain private key in which means all transfers show as the entire balance more each time I do a 0.001 transfer.
Did you have a strong pw on multibit? Have you installed any exe or java programs recently? How long since reinstalling windows? Run malwarebytes and see what it finds. 
If they have been stolen I really feel for you, the guys who do that sort of thing are rather self destructive as it undermines the value of coins if they keep being stolen.

Yes I think so.. There should be 2 codes on a paper wallet the address (starting in 1??????? and sometimes incorrectly referred to as the public key) and the private key (starting in 5??????).  
There may or may not be QR codes on the paper depending on where you're getting it from (bitaddress.org has 2 QR codes on the fancy paper wallet designs).  These QR codes are simply these address &amp; private key codes so it's important your private key text + private key QR code are never visible to anyone except yourself (or whoever you want to be able to spend these funds).
The amusing story about someone showing a paper wallet on a TV show a few weeks ago highlights this fact as someone managed to scan the QR code and take all their money (luckily they're an honest person and gave the funds back to them but in a more secure fasion!)

Perhaps look at all the Quantitative Easing that's taking place right now in many economies right now.  The idea of doing such a thing to a currency that moved to fiat (i.e. not backed by gold) is probably the reception of the future generations using bitcoin.  Right now while bitcoin is still becoming understood there is absolutely no chance it would increase as it's finiteness is one of bitcoin's key attributes giving it value... anyone trying to change that rule would never be taken seriously by the majority of the network so would never be adopted.
I'd say it could never happen but the fact that we have QE in the last decade shows anything is possible.

* An increase in the number of reasons bitcoin is **required** by a person or institution
  
* People speculate bitcoin will be worth more in future than other commodities.
* More people get involved.
At the moment mainly the second and third options are happening but given time more of the first seems likely.
Right now I can only think of value preservation in a hyperinflation country, companies required to hold bitcoin and ransomware as a few examples where bitcoin is absolutely required, but more and more reasons look to appear in time.
For an extreme example, if the central bank of (name hyperinflation country) only exchanged their currency for bitcoin it will create huge demand on the scarce resource.  With bitcoin being a globally recognized unit of value that is pretty cheap to purchase for the first national it could very well stem hyperinflation for early adopters.
Clearly this is a crazy idea right now because the market cap isn't large enough and would cause the price well beyond $10k but in time with global financial issues it is a possible outcome.
Will any of these happen in 2018?  Doubt it apart from the speculation and more people getting involved.  
Personally I'd like to see a few layer2 items appear before people start pushing bitcoin to the mainstream uses.

Firstly I'd like to tip my hat to you pioneering new tech and taking time to try it.
I'd suggest opening a wallet with blockchain.info, you get the private key to this so you know you can always access your funds regardless to if blockchain.info exists or not.
Also you may want to not 'cash out' to local fiat USD immediately, if you keep it as btc you can do other things with it such as
* micro tip/reward well written articles to encourage impartial views.
* simplify global commerce via paying programmers in another country via btc for instance.
* perhaps pay for hosting/services
* place bounty's on articles to be written (e.g. publishing scientific journals now becomes commercially viable in wikipedia)
This may help lower running costs and also generate new revenue models while keeping all the information free and available to all.

May I try and show this example as a good demonstration on the strength of bitcoin as it has a direct parallel.
This example describes someone who didn't trust their family with his password and/or instructions on how to retrieve the password on their demise so is clearly wanting to not pass them on (for what ever reason)
This example is therefore the same as the father burying euros out in the middle of some random forest and not telling his family where they are because he didn't trust them to dig it all up and not leave a will.
The obvious solution is to set up a will where instructions on how to redeem the coins should be sufficient (ie. what the password is AND where to find the private key for instance or perhaps where in the field his euros are buried)
There are also MxN transactions too... this allows you to give a password to say 2 people and only when they both agree to use it do the funds become unlocked.  It's a pretty advanced feature and a bit of a sledge hammer on a nut scenario but is possible if you really really want to go to those lengths.
Anyone can check a bitcoin account balance, the address can be made public safely so you know if your funds are still there regardless to having the password or not.
If you really don't see any advantages I'm delusional or not explaining it well enough I'm afraid.

Right now most nations don't use electronic systems for payment.  Visa/MC are probably the highest used digital payment systems and only need a fraction of this.  I think I read something like 4,000tps peak throughput, however if Bitcoin can be shown how it will cope with this vast number of transactions we can be sure it's fit for purpose for many years to come.
What is on the horizon is
* Digital payment usage is still growing world wide
* Many countries don't have access to MC/Visa services yet will have digital currency access.
* MC/Visa are not used for person to person transactions yet.
* MC/Visa can't be used by autonomous agents/robots whereas digital currencies can be. 
* Share trading, forex trading, contracts, proofs, patents and other uses of digital currencies will create additional transactions beyond payment transactions.  These services are still in their infancy and will grow rapidly as people become aware and accustomed to them.
Whilst it's clear alt chains backed by bitcoin can already solve this, I'd love to hear if the bitcoin protocol needs any changes to make sure it could cope with that sort of traffic without the need for alt chains.

There's been a lot of similar posts like this so forgive me being suspicious especially anyone taking their own life would probably have had time to leave instructions to his spouse but I guess I don't know the full circumstances so will go along with this being genuine.
Firstly learn about bitcoin, trybtc.com is a great place to start.
Get yourself a wallet by clicking on  
Learn how to transfer a small amount of btc and get comfortable with this.
When you're happy knowing how wallets work, see if you can log into the deceased  account.  They probably have a mobile phone linked to it so you'll need that to receive SMS's to get access, without this you'll need help retrieving them from the key held on the computer itself... absolutely do not clear the browser cache if you don't have access to their phone!
Other ways he may have stored the bitcoin are 
On the PC:
- search for "wallet.dat" or bitcoind file, if you find these he may be using the core reference wallet so you can open bitcoind to see if there are any funds in there.
- Other popular wallets like Etherum or multibit.
On the web:
- You mention blockchain.info, this is quite a likely popular choice.  Again you'll need a password to login at a guess and probably also access to his mobile phone for the authentication when you try to log in.  If you don't have these please DO NOT CLEAR THE BROWSER CACHE!  You may still be able to retrieve the funds if the password isn't too difficult.
On his phone(s):
If they have breadwallet, mycelium or other wallet app the bitcoin may be in there too.
On paper:
All of these are likely to be locked with a password so most likely without that you're going to be screwed.  If the private key starts with a '5' you're ok, if it starts with a '6' you need that password again.  If you get totally stuck on that you can put the public address up and the private key starting with a 6 and a bounty hoping some kind soul helps you retrieve the funds... they may well steal them so beware!
You can safely post addresses (i.e. that start with a '1' or a '3'), never share or post the private keys (start with a '5' or a '6').
I think first thing you need to do is find out if he had a book of passwords somewhere as inevitably he'll have taken security seriously if he was into mining.
If he's been mining for years the majority of funds are likely to be on paper.  If he's only been at it for the last couple years he may only be using blockchain.info or bitcoind... sort of depends how involved he got really.
Pretty much all mining equipment is unprofitable, especially if it's older than a year.  Best bet, post the mining gear on ebay and see what you get.  Do not however ebay any computer/laptop at least until you're 100% certain you've extracted the bitcoin from it to an address the wife controls.
Really sorry for the loss of your friend, good luck with the search and PM me if you really need specific help.

I agree that this is a serious issue to wrestle with and needs some head scratching to resolve but it is surmountable ironically via bitcoin banks or perhaps by introducing delayed transactions for example.
For instance for delayed transactions we could have new addresses that start with '4xxxx' and when funds are spent from these addresses they are announced on the network like all regular transactions that anyone can see but have a fixed waiting period of say a day before they can be accepted into the blockchain.  During this time anyone with the private key can issue a 'delete/undo' so this transaction command is never added to the blockchain.  (In true disclosure I'm paraphrasing an amazing idea by someone else here that I tend to agree is worthy of serious discussion).
There are probably many other solutions out there too and this is just one potential answer that could be added should &gt; 50% of the community agree it being necessary.
For this reason the title seems misguided since layers can be built on top of bitcoin (let's face it tcp is U-G-L-Y to the mass public) and if it was so serious that it causes a downfall of the ecosystem I'm sure people would be willing to adapt the protocol to accept a solution that ensures it's survival.

Just curious why the manifest file is not done, is that intentional or just not known about?
 
[iOS Manifest File Details](
I believe this would allow the app to work fully offline (or at least never need to download the content each time it opens).
Also I can't seem to get the QR code scanning working, just seems to ignore the button press.
Finally, if the QR code scanning was to work... am I missing something or wouldn't it be more intuitive to have a scanQR code button in the 'Send' Address part so you can pay for your coffee by scanning the till's payment request?

I'm a fan of using cents, dollars, pounds, yen, etc.. that people already use to describe currency.
So let me poke the hornet's nest... how do you feel about **1000 satoshi's = 1 bit-cent**?
From here people will have a bit-dollar.  At current exchange rates we'd have
**At the current exchange rate we have**
    1 USD = 263.000 bit-cents.
    1 USD = 2.63 bit-dollars.
    1 USD = 0.002630 bitcoins.
Low extreme exchange rate of ** 1BTC = $100 USD **
    1 USD = 1000 bit-cents.
    1 USD = 10 bit-dollars.
Let's take the other extreme of ** 1BTC = $10,000 USD **
    1 USD = 10 bit-cents.
    1 USD = 0.1 bit-dollars
These should be easy to relate to numbers and we can convert between cents and dollars easily in our heads.

This may be a misleading question... if it's about 21 they'll likely run the pool themselves so the devices don't actually have wallets at all.  These chips could be hashing away and IF that chip finds a solution it transmits the solution back to 21 whereby they receive the mining reward.
The devices themselves could therefore buy/sell things themselves via 21's own network, none of it has to touch the blockchain and I'd be shocked if their plan was for the devices to issue their own blockchain transactions as that clearly will not work until the vast scalability is addressed for bitcoin.

Whilst you're correct keep in mind human psychology kicks in as a multiplier... if such an unorthodox change like that happened the perceived value would drop far faster than purely the dilution calculation.
It's probably all academic as the incentive is for miners to not screw up the system they're working hard to secure.

I'd expect the damage in perception it would cause if the miners even tried to promote this alt would devalue xbt so much that people would either branch a new coin with a new hashing algorithm (thereby excluding established miners) or perhaps people would simply dump xbt for a more finite digital resource.  Either way the xbt miners would cause such damage to their own economy it's hard to foresee it happening in our lifetime unless there was an advantage for the miners to encourage xbt to devalue.
Will make a fascinating economics thesis for someone in the future :)

You've been misinformed I'm afraid.  
People can't censor bitcoin unless the malicious entity owned more than 50% of the mining power constantly you can't block transactions occurring.  If a malicious miner were to do this, bitcoin's value would drop thereby making it even more expensive for the continued attack.
If taken to the extreme and people threw away millions of dollars a day just to do such a daft attack the system can still be adapted to remove this threat... but it's such a stupid threat it's probably more effective to ban citizens using the internet.

Give them a break, they're being attacked by phone manufacturers, internet payment gateways, banks, digital currencies, fraudsters, etc...
Their glory days are coming to an abrupt end and a lot of hardworking people will be jobless in the next decade if they don't adapt.  The ones who don't see this I have no sympathy for as they've become complaisant thinking the world hasn't changed.   This move to become a P2P payment system is worth venturing but seems too little too late IMHO.
The sad truth is their business model was 2 fold, lending people money and charging interest and secondly providing a payment gateway for merchants.  
The second part of their business model is being destroyed as it can now be replicated by even a teenager in their garage.  Lending money and associating their trusted brand name in the bitcoin space where people are looking for legitimacy are two routes I can see that may prevent them from becoming the Kodak equivalent of the finance world after this upcoming turmoil but a big firm like that will find it difficult to pivot quickly.  
Absolutely fascinating to watch though!

What may work is if the hard fork is a failure and instead of a second hard fork to fix it they roll back.  At this point you may have been able to earn all the lovely new coins on the old branch with significant mining power however the difficulty will still be as high as the main branch for what would probably be years if only GPU miners were on it by which point I'm pretty sure the main chain would have been clearly decided.
I would keep your hardware though, I wouldn't be too surprised if we end up changing the hashing algorithm in the years to come if someone threatens centralised mining.
@_date: 2017-02-02 10:37:37
The issue is it depends on many moving factors.  A simple answer, assuming the 4MB is actually Blockchain size increase is if we say you can have 3tx/sec right now, this will jump to 12tx/sec Giving 720tx/min on avg.
The typical bitcoin tx size is around 500bytes.  That's 2000 tx/s per block or 200 per min = 3tx/sec.
The issue is the type of tx depends on how much space is used (in both the blockchain and segwit data).  For instance standard txs we use right now, even with segwit active, won't produce any saving at all.  Multisig txs also take more space, as do txs with multiple inputs so this guide of 500 is just an average taken from here...
[Tradeblock Stats](
If however we expect segwit txs to become the norm, this could squeeze even more txs in each blockchain block so could potentially get in excess of 1400tx/min.  
My main caveat with all this is I'm assuming you're talking 4Mb blockchain blocks, not the block weight value as specified by segwit.  If you're talking 4Mb with segwit the rates is most likely not much more than the current 200 tx/min until more wallets adopt segwit and eventually we can squeeze as many as 1400tx/min in.

Probably best to start reading through the Getting Started on the right.
Also trybtc.com is a great introduction to it all.
Please don't worry about mining unless you're technically apt and have a lot of money to spend (talking $4k+).  Right now mining is a more expensive way to get bitcoin compared to buying them from exchanges like bitstamp or circle.
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:37:50
I'm going for a simple set of answers because others have given good details already.
What is it backed by?  
I'd say mathematics.  It's purely about being a limited finite resource that can be sent instantly over the Internet. A bitcoin unit is actually just a number in a ledger (the blockchain) where you know that the sum of all these balances can never exceed 21 million (it's actually around 16 million at the moment as the other 5 million get added to the ecosystem in a predictable manner over the next 123 years)
The way the system works is anyone running a bitcoin node (can download this from bitcoin.org links) is checking everyone else's transactions around the world to make sure the rules are being followed. (Eg the funds aren't double spent, they had the authority to transfer said the funds, they haven't created new coins out of nowhere expect as allowed by the mining rewards that gradually add the new coins to the ecosystem system)
This way there is no central owner/controller of the network so why it can never be shut down, much like the Internet itself.
Because no person, company or even country controls the supply, validity or can censor any transactions, the units have value globally.
This leads to an interesting possible outcome of the experiment... People could start using bitcoin as a Base standard unit that enables currencies to be efficiently  in terms of time and country.
Eg 1 usd = 0.0001 ₿ bitcoin at epoch time 14132038. 
For software developers and international trading this simplifies things immensely and has the added benefit that programs can transfer value directly between people or institutions without some private company or bank needing to take a cut.

Confirmation times are not that important and almost certainly won't be changed for Bitcoin.
10 minutes is more than fast enough yet sadly many companies are playing it safe and waiting for unnecessary confirmations before saying the order is accepted.
This isn't actually required, to double spend on the network these days is not simple and unconfirmed transactions are usually sufficient and instant... larger value transactions or postal orders may want to wait for the confirmation but that is a tradeoff from trusting the sender vs convenience.  Shorter blocktimes may decrease the wait slightly but certainly do not solve this as even a 1 minute blocktime could still result in a 30 minute delay before a confirmation due to probability.
There are techniques to avoid waiting for confirmation times at all, we're seeing a lot of businesses waiting for this confirmation simply because it's new and the confirmation approach is the easiest and most secure way to verify a legitimate transaction but isn't the only solution.
For instance using systems like greenaddress.it enable instant confirmations since they won't sign a double spend transaction.  Micropayments channels and the likes also solve this but are technically harder to implement.
As the ecosystem matures we'll see even more pop up at a guess.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:28:12
Even if he wanted to he couldn't and the source code is there to independently verify if you want (or hire someone although I'm giving you my research on it for free).  
The address that holds your bitcoins is derived from your own private key number.
Only with that private key number can your coins be moved, it is the strength in how bitcoin works that enforces this to be true.
So who do you need to trust?
a) Who ever generated your private key (so the paranoid may want to make this number up themselves with a dice and some paper).  If you'd prefer you can download the most common wallet for your device via  and have reassurance it's been crowd tested as secure.
b) Trust the device you're using the wallet on.

Ok, perhaps reword it better but I stand by my oversimplified statement.
The 25BTC created can only be done by professional mining operations, a state of the art home 3TH setup is going to earn no more than 0.07btc a day for someone (~$20).  Unless you have millions of $ to invest and purchase a mining operation you'll never get any substantial bitcoin to use via mining so is not viable for a 'How To' newbies document.
"It's vastly more secure than debit cards"
Again, digital currencies use asymmetric cryptography to sign transactions so the number is unique and different each time... credit/debit cards use... well a single number for everything and people can pull as much and as often as they like.  There is so much fraud these days it simply isn't feasible to police so instead chargebacks exist where merchants become the ones liable as the money is literally pulled back from their account... ironic given the banks and credit card companies don't suffer from their frankly grossly inadequate system in the internet world.
As proof to my point, here's my bitcoin address anyone can do their worst with... 13rRMZdNVZnL8ZEvrx4yoxBGUWHr5e24Dn
Here's a great example of why you should not post your bank or debit card info (not to mention you're legally liable for the losses if you do)

Ok, I'll bite... 
* NASDAQ/NYSE both sniffing around 
* Only the other month I went to a presentation in the heart of London's business district with nearly all the major banks and traders in the UK present to discuss bitcoin, discovered a few were actively researching projects using bitcoin for their own products but not wanting to announce it yet probably due to the advantage they'll have over their competitors if they decide to launch.
* Lightning network showing just one solution which sounds like it could allow bitcoin to rival the TPS of existing vast payment providers.
* received my first physical bitcoin driven debit card that can be used for purchases in any retailer world wide.
* transaction volume has continually been increasing so much that we're now entering the 1Mb limit territory well before expected.
Any one of these would have sounded unbelievable only a year ago, so if this is considered stagnation in the financial world I'm in disbelief as to why I still have to type my insecure credit card number in on websites after 20 years.
Yes the price hasn't sky rocketed in over a year and may not for another few more years but the system is still running incredibly well 24/7 after 2,337 days of operation.

Only miners lose earnings on the halving, mining has always been known to be a zero sum game... just because they're making money now doesn't guarantee them making money in the future.  Individual involvement is not really important as long as someone does it and people will as long as it's profitable.  If it's unprofitable people quit making it slightly more profitable for those that remain... process continues until we're at equilibrium again.
Not sure I see the problem but perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're saying?
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:04:03
The issue isn't that a miner will mine a block that's bigger than a set size to confirm it, the issue is if another miner solves a block that is say 15Mb all other miners should accept this.  If any miners don't accept blocks &gt; 1Mb blocks they'll never accept that 15Mb block and more importantly the chain of blocks that will be build on top of it.  If &gt; 50% of the mining power does accept the &gt;1Mb blocks and some don't we'll end up with a hard fork.
This is likely to get resolved quickly because it then becomes about the payment processors like BitPay, BitStamp, Circle, etc... on which chain they decide to follow.  They'd likely follow the most recent one unless there is a serious error since they will want to follow the chain with the most mining power otherwise their customers may lose out.

Good well written article.
Do wish they'd not refer to individual 'coins' though, seems to perpetuate a common misconception that bitcoins are something more mystical than a balance entry in the global database.

Bitcoin in it's current form isn't suitable for global store adoption and will end in another boom/bust cycle if pushed now.
Bitcoin needs a layer on top such as Lightning Network, payment hubs or something else to cope with that sort of use case.  
We're currently not much further than the stage of typing in IP addresses into FTP command line clients.
The whole process needs to be easier, faster and cheaper for mainstream merchant adoption.  
@_date: 2014-12-02 09:02:38
Please avoid saying 'magic' as it may come across as patronising.
I found the analogy depends on the audience. Most working adults use excel so that analogy is easiest to grasp (a Bitcoin address is a given row in an excel sheet that stores a positive balance, if you know the password for that row you can send some of those funds to another row/address that is owned by someone else. The network is very secure due to many copies of this excel file existing and the revolutionary new blockchain technology that makes sure only valid changes can be made) whilst not technically correct it lets people grasp the idea they are only storing passwords in their wallet and bitcoins are decentralised.
Good luck with the talk!

@_date: 2017-02-01 11:26:03
If you don't know what a fork is you don't need to worry about them ;)
But if you're curious... because bitcoin is decentralised hundreds/thousands of people keep a copy of what they believe is the true current state of the network.  A fork is when the blockchain ledger has two different versions/histories because both think the other chain is invalid.
Generally it doesn't effect the users since if you make a transaction it simply means your transaction is put in both versions of the ledgers automatically (you won't need to do or see any difference).
Where it gets messy is the new coins that have been created in those blocks belong to two different people.  When they are able to spend those coins after 100 blocks it starts getting more serious.  This means in the future at some point one of those ledgers is going to be obliterated and those miners simply vanish because they never existed in the fork that is eventually chosen.
This is how most people 'lose money' in a fork, they're referring to the miners.
If the fork goes on beyond the 100 blocks OR if someone plays on a bug that invokes a fork (we're not aware of any of these bugs existing at the moment), the person receiving that transaction may have it erased from the history if that fork loses... this is incredibly unlikely to happen because it would typically have to be a very targeted attack during a very public forking event.
Typically the perceived value of bitcoin would be effected during a fork waiting for the dust to settle, once one fork is adopted by the community life returns to normal.   
It's important to remember bitcoin is designed for forks and to continue working well, it's just been incredibly stable over the last few years that people get worried about a non-event now the asset has become more valuable.

It's precisely what society is.  We could all be selfish individuals going around stealing each others food, mates and housing... it's all excellent if you're the biggest person doing that but for everyone else it stinks.  We therefore as a society try to agree on rules that the majority will benefit from and what separates us from animals.
Basic income has the advantage that an individual is not penalised for getting employed, it merely allows them to get a much better standard of life if they decide to work.
E.g. why would someone who gets $200/week on income support throw all that away for a 9-5 job earning $400/week and they have to pay $100/week on transport and $50 tax. 
Equally, why does someone earning $1000/week not receive that $200/week?  Seems rather unfair the one person who's not working gets the money but the person working doesn't??
Not saying it's a silver bullet but the current system where I live is so heavily riddled in if/then clauses it's an expensive system to operate, deters people from working and seems only the lazy smart ones know how to maximise their income from it instead of those who could actually use it.
Like I say, I don't know if basic income is a good solution or not (will follow the experiment happening in Finland because I prefer statistics than just gut feeling) so wouldn't dismiss it until we know if it works or not.

Theoretically yes, if all the miners and payment providers adopted a new system which allowed for more BTC to be issued to miners in future it can but would make a hard fork.
Due to a hard fork needed in practice it is so incredibly unlikely to happen I'd say not, at least not in our lifetime. The issue is if more were to be added in would shake confidence in it being a finite resource so anyone involved in the ecosystem would lose out.
Look at how difficult it is just to increase the block size from the temporary 1Mb to 20Mb being proposed... if bitcoin is still around in 10 years it's going to be even harder to make a significant change like that.
Who knows though, it's hard enough to see 5 years into the future never mind 50.

Sadly very true... Bitcoin really just needs some HCI gurus to sort wallets out.  We're entering a stage where non-technical people are interested and they don't give a crap about publickey hashes and RBF issues, I expect they just want 
* Easy exchanging to and from their local currency
* A standardised simple account number (i.e. mnemonic HD private key)
* A current balance (Showing potential pending changes)
* An easy way to send value to people
* A list of historical transactions with optional payment summary info on what the transaction was for
* Have confidence their stored value is safe.
Crack that (and the scalability) and Paypal will become a 21st century relic... unless of course they pick up their socks and are the first to market with such a  bitcoin wallet.
PayPal are ironically the company who stands to make the most from bitcoin as they can address a lot of the usability issues and I expect reduce their costs (and fraud issues) due to the legacy bank payment networks.

You can use the same address to receive multiple payments to, it's when you go to spend from the address the best practice is to not use that address again... It is however normally safe to do so as long as you don't reuse the random value value and no one breaks the pubkey -&gt; priv (only really feasible with a breakthrough in mathematics or quantum computing which neither are currently thought to exist)

It's a method to host an indestructible database where there is no controlling entity but instead anyone can edit the contents as long as they can prove they have permission to make changes via knowing the private keys or other requirements set out by the previous entries.
So it may seem wasteful for most databases but where we historically need a trusted 3rd party to verify the database this invention removes this necessity in an incredibly robust way.

Not sure what is so unsafe about having a single address on your donation website?  It's not like those funds would be at risk and in fact is sort of how bitcoin is designed to work.
If you want to obscure (really not sure why you would), you can just generate say 20 addresses and have javascript just randomly show one of those 20.
If you want a better system, you can get your xpub key from your HD wallet and use some JS code to derive a public key to display but you'll still need some server logic to increment the counter each time you receive some funds there.  (Look at coinb.in or search github for js source code to do this I guess)
The next stage is to actually implement a payment hub, mycelium gear is probably a good place as any to start.
Otherwise go the whole hog, run a bitcoind client on a server and get addresses from this using RPC calls from your server.
Personally I'd just type a bitcoin address on my page because it is secure, simple and works :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:25:33
I'd recommending doing some market research to see if the need exists, if it does go do it!
My hunch is the market doesn't exist as bitcoin has been designed for internet usage to give an alternative to using banks for value storage and transfer.
That said, Casascius coins did what you're talking about, it was a trusted 3rd party and their hologram labels offered some assurance the bitcoin was still at that address.  The issue is building that trust the coin hasn't been spent, double printed or may have it's funds removed in future.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:31:49
You may like to note you can derive the public key from the private key.  The public key maps to the bitcoin address hence why you can see which addresses you control in the bitcoin wallet simply by having the private keys.

If it helps a few points...
- Mining will always take about 10 minutes to solve on average regardless to having billions of computers hammering the equation or it's just little ole' me on my laptop supporting the network.  It self adjusts such that the network will always take 'on average' 10 minutes to find a solution.  People turning on/off hashing hardware just reduces/increases the chances your machine will be the one who finds the solution to the next block to add to the blockchain.
I.e. really don't worry about it as it's a positive re-enforcing system and the hash rate only effects miners, not users.
The other point is you're comparing bitcoin and fiat, the two are incredibly different.  Not sure where to start with this but think about trying to spend a 5cm cube of ruthenium in your local shop... it's bloody difficult to get anyone to accept it because they have no idea what it's utility is or what the market value is they'll be able to trade it at even though it is so expensive they'd be lucky to ever see a cube of it in their lifetime.
Bitcoin is simliar in that it's a finite resource and people who understand what it can do are keen to get hold of as much of it as they can because in time others will start to understand why it's so valuable.
Right now bitcoin sucks at a store of value for most developed countries.  Firstly it has 10% inflation, secondly it's so new that there are a few whales out there able to throw their weight around to move the price any which way they'd like.
Both of these will change over time.  Inflation halves for each block halving every 4 years.  So in 2017 Bitcoin inflation is only 5% and in 2021 2.5%, 2025 it will be less than nearly all fiat currencies.  This is 100% predictable, certain, facts... no fiat can offer this.  At inflation &lt; local fiat inflation it now becomes more appealing to have your value stored as bitcoin rather than any local fiat as you merely exchange out to your local currencies as you need to spend locally.
Bitcoin is still an experiment, it's still incredibly young, it's still vastly untapped for what it's designed for and it's a technology that can't be uninvented so here to stay.
This is why the number of people using it will continue to grow quietly and the supply/demand ratio can only become established given much longer time scales than 6 years.

I actually think 21 may have a good idea if done well but a few of the slides glance over a few serious technical issues they need to address for it to be viable.
1) They mention the mining reward can be split... this is rather misleading as that reward split is not with the device owner but probably the device manufacturer. 
This means the hardware manufacturer would gain the 25% subsidy.  Unless the end user benefits they'll have the PR issue Steam encountered (the backlash of stealing consumers's electricity for mining)
2) Microtransactions requires a layer on top of Bitcoin to be viable, this needs to be vastly scalable beyond our current solutions.  Perhaps this is their grand plan as if they do solve this they'll be far more powerful than any banking system could.  If they're hiring programmers I'm certainly interested :)

I'd like to say this is true too since I didn't see anything selecting transactions based on mining fees in the reference client( I believe it was simply first transaction found with sufficient mining fees is used)...

I'm pro Bitcoin and know it's the furthest from a Ponzi scheme you can get but one difficult point to counter is Satoshi and a few others have vast amounts so while demand drives the price up which brings in speculators to accelerate that price it does start to resemble a scam benefiting the early adopters and mysterious creator especially.

@_date: 2015-05-28 13:32:02
Not sure there is an ELI5 answer as you need to understand how the blockchain works but here goes...
As anyone around the world publishes a bitcoin transaction it is a simple unencrypted set of numbers (around say 100 of them) to say where to obtain the funds from (such as your source bitcoin address) and where they are going to.  To make sure not anyone can do this each of these transactions also has a signature... a unique code that can only be calculated by the person owning the private key that relates to the source funds.
So these transactions get issued from your PC/phone/whatever to the bitcoin network and picked up by all the miners who want to include it (usually because there is a fee they can collect from processing your transaction).  The miners append your transaction to the block they are currently trying to solve.  Mining is just a rather fancy way to make sure you pick someone truly at random around the world where everyone can trust the person has been selected by random.  Think of it as a riddle and it's easy to know when a riddle is solved but hard to solve it.  The riddle is different each time but the network knows how many people are trying to solve the riddle so can scale the complexity such that on average someone will solve the riddle every 10 minutes.
When a miner finds a solution the write their solution along with all the transactions they've agreed are correctly signed at this point.  Now this group of transactions is called the block and is added to the other blocks previously solved to forever grow this blockchain historical ledger.
Still with me?
Ok, so there is an artificial limit of each block can be a maximum size of 1Mb to prevent spamming of the network, it wasn't there originally but added as a temporary safety net... as bitcoin is becoming more widely used every day these blocks are getting bigger and reaching this limit that was set.  The solution is to merely increase this size and life continues.  The difficulty in doing that is at least 50% of the miners and the payment processors will have to agree that the &gt;1Mb block size is ok, if they don't it generates a fork where we have two bitcoin historical ledgers in existence.  Eventually one will whittle out and die but during the ambigious time there is a lot of uncertainty and becomes theoretically possible to do nasty crap like double spend or if the fork goes on too long, to actually spend money that won't actually exist in the future (i.e. spending the mining reward which is later rewritten that someone else earned).  Now the system has had hard forks in the past and history show they get resolved very quickly... all the talk going on at the moment is to make sure a hard fork isn't even needed to make this change.
So who owns bitcoin?  Weirdly everyone.  The ecosystem that makes up &gt; 50% of the mining gets to call the shots on the longest chain... Which is the chain people use?  Typically the longest but I think realistically it's the lowest common denominator of the major exchanges and payment providers use.
Overall this is probably a storm in a teacup escapade merely because Gavin is doing the right thing of voicing his vote for a change should be made and asking for others feedback on if they'll support this or could it cause a hard fork because some people believe keeping it at 1Mb somehow adds value to the ecosystem.
Seems a no-brainer to increase it assuming the tests have behaved themselves and there's a contingency plan on rollback quickly should something unexpected happen.

TL;DR: No one has suggested a feasible way yet and probably against the ethos of what Bitcoin is about (a raw fungible agnostic trading mechanism)
There are two approaches.
Banning transactions or banning usage.
*Banning transactions* means it would require ALL miners to ban those coins.  It's incredibly unlikely to happen.  Luke-jr has a list of addresses he bans mining transactions for in his bitcoin build, at the end of the day it's a true democracy with mining so people are free to do as they please.  Most miners however don't ban things like Satoshi Dice so this banning merely slows down the average transaction time from these wallets, it doesn't stop them.
It only takes 1 miner who accepts them to transfer the funds to a new address to break the ban therefore this approach is not practical to work, especially for small thefts like $5m.
The other approach is for merchants to check the tainted percentage of funds before accepting them.  Given these stolen funds can be mixed with legitimate funds you'd need a threshold of how clean the money is to accept it.
Again this would only slow things down as over time they will become more diluted throughout the network making this approach infeasible too.
Best bet is use good old fashion policing to work the electronic trail of transactions and eventually nab whoever is spending them when they slip up by doing something daft like using localbitcoins to trade some.
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:10:43
Good to suggest but what happens when the average block size is 100mb, is each block really going to be hashed in 6 seconds? Seems a recipe for disaster in future.
My vote is up the limit at the moment as seems easiest and if that breaks it all...well it means the experiment has completed and bitcoinv2 will be born.
Certainly prefer it was tested on litecoin first!

You may find systems like NXT more appealing and/or look at concurrent chains that share the bitcoin protocol and reference the chain like namecoin. It's best to avoid inserting metadata directly in bitcoin blockchain as future versions or your needs may change and find it too rigid.
There are some existing hash tag systems that send random micro payments to invalid addresses which are custom hashes that can be used to tag proof of existence at a given point in time... The name escapes me but like I say you'll probably find making a concurrent chain is more flexible and future proof.

This seems from ages ago?  If you're saying your computer was off at the time there are a few things I'd check.
1) Verify your computer was indeed off during this time (Look at the log files, search any files that may have been updated on this date).  If you find any files were modified or logs written on this day it looks like a burglary.  You say no one knows your password but if you're in a house share situation or have a cleaner, landlord + key logger it is entirely feasible.   It seems highly unlikely but easy to rule it out.
2) Your PC was compromised before you went away and somehow they remotely got a copy of your wallet and password to remove the funds at their leisure.
Do you use teamviewer / VNC / run a server on it, etc..?  Have you ever backed up your files somewhere else like dropbox or any other shared server system?
3) There is a security flaw in the wallet you used.  Either the wallet was compromised from the outset (unlikely), you imported a private key from something like a brain wallet (again unlikely).
My hunch would be  although it was a significant amount of money if you had been telling people about your wealth  isn't infeasible either.

(Correction on sums)
At least 3.859GW of power is currently used for mining bitcoin (3859989 THashes at the moment, 1 THash ~ 1000watts), this will eventually increase to 38GW of power used to achieve equilibrium of the value per block until 2020 when it halves again.

Not sure how it could render Bitcoin worthless but there is a slim chance it could become more mainstream than bitcoin if they can do it elegantly and address a real issue that Bitcoin's protocol.
Whilst I really like the idea in principal and think they're doing something amazing, it seems more parallel and complementary development rather than any sort of Bitcoin replacement.
As I understand it Ethereum seems to have it's place in contracts and is more going head to head with things like NXT/Counterparty.  Whilst technically it could go head to head with Bitcoin and address some short falls it certain seems more aimed at complex contracts rather than secure value transfer.  It's incredibly raw and low level and certainly isn't aimed at mainstream usage.
I wouldn't be too surprised if we see the first side chain actually appearing from ethereum, I mean it may just take one contract creator to do some funky logic to query bitcoin's blockchain, the creator invest their bitcoin into their contract system for a set of exchangeable tokens and wham... you have the first viable two way sidechain.
Ok, grossly oversimplifying it but if Ethereum wants to make waves it'll take someone proving something like this is possible.
I'd also like to point out the guys doing Ethereum are vastly smarter than I am so they probably have many better ideas on where they are taking the tech and will probably surprise us all but I for one am still waiting to see the concrete example that solves a real problem in a more elegant way before getting too excited about it.

Scales of economy mainly.  
* Ability to purchase equipment on bulk is likely to get a better rate
* No pool fees to pay since they are the pool.
* It takes time to maintain and monitor a node.  A mining company only needs one node running with a vast rack of miners hence more cost efficient.  Whilst not really a point against hobbiest miners, it is when making money and you need to aim for 100% uptime.
* Industrial electricity is probably cheaper than domestic electricity in many regions (speculation, I don't know this for sure)
* Requires money to purchase the mining equipment.  A mining company making lots of money is capable of re-invest that money to purchase the most efficient hardware to remain competitive.  Small hobbiests won't make enough money to do this from their mining earnings.

I don't read it about having any sort of local admin privileges to the computer since this is totally separate from the Bios and CPU and can be done remotely even after a factory reset.  This sounds more like there being a global private key to send messages to any computer with it in and it would circumvent all security preventions taken.  With that key (or worse if there's an exploit to work around it), there is literally nothing anyone can do to stop an intruder at this point.
That key is being held by a private company, who knows how many people know this number... what assurance do we have that Intel have done background checks on anyone who has access to it for instance?
This is why I find the article so far fetched and unlikely as this would be vastly insecure if true.
You mention peace of mind for locating stolen goods and whilst I agree it would be able to do this, my point is that this number (if it exists) would be so incredibly dangerous to have there's no way more than a handful of people should have access to it so wouldn't be feasible for general use such as finding stolen hardware.
Again, I'm really sceptical this is true as it's just too far fetched.

Agreed, seems pretty naive of the hacker(s) thinking they'll be able to flog the lot for USD in one go.  What bugs me is they must be pretty clever to have done the hack yet they seem disconnected from reality thinking those coins are worth anywhere near $4m given they've just put the main exchange offline that will clearly knock the price lower and asking someone to openly buy stolen goods so the buyer faces jail time too.
I'd like to believe the hacker is going to do the right thing and return most of the stolen coins plus keep a reward but time will tell.  If they still want to make a quick buck out of it legally they could buy shed loads of bitcoin from Bitstamp or whoever before returning them and everyone watches the price rise as confidence is restored.

USD depreciates at 4% a year so 
$10,000/ $500 = 20x growth required.
104% ^ 80 years = 20x.
So if Bitcoin does nothing but tread water as a store of value and the USD continues to perform well it's approximately 80 years before 1btc = $10k. My guess is a few more people may start using bitcoin around the world as it becomes easier to use thereby spreading the resource thinner and pushing the exchange price higher... my reasoning?

If you have more than $50 it's worth doing properly as probably recoverable.
Worse case you can send it to a forensics/recovery lab to extract the file if it's a physical disk platter system but they'll destroy your HD in the process and it isn't cheap (i expect $500+)

I'm no expert in this so expect someone more qualified in ETF's can explain this but this is my understanding...
The Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a mechanism to allow big players (e.g. pension funds, insurance companies, etc..) to buy and sell a commodity without actually having to get it's hands dirty and deal with the commodity itself.  These ETF fund can be traded throughout the day as the stock exchange it's listed on remains open.  The ETF essentially buys some of the commodity, i.e. bitcoin, and issues shares of the ETF's holdings to people who want to buy into that commodity.
These shares can now be bought and sold by others.  Given people could purchase the commodity directly the valuation of the ETF must mirror the average market price of the commodity, in bitcoin's case the average price of exchanges like BitStamp, Kraken, BTC-e, etc...
I'm speculating on this but I expect if there is too much demand for an ETF they'll be forced to purchase more BTC such that the ETFs share price follows the commodities market.  Likewise if there is too much sales pressure they'd sell bitcoin to increase their ETF share price.  
I expect this part has to be heavily regulated to avoid them faking it.
Take these posts of 'in 4 weeks' with a massive pinch of salt, especially when made from a bitcoin enthusiast,  it looks likely we may see ETFs launched someday but until it happens no one really knows as that would allow for massive market manipulation.

For once I feel sorry for the banks who get burnt by this if they don't see past his bullshit.  
Companies are by design to make money for themselves and WILL exit. Who will they exit to? If successful it will be to the company standing to make the most from the process thereby being the most damaging to the rest of the clients of the private chain. 
I'd not touch private 3rd party chains with a barge pole because of this.

Trezor mentioned it only cost them $19 or something to make the product, the other price was to recoup development costs, support, marketing and a little profit.
Do you think they've considered making a cheap $30 Trezor but each transaction x% goes to Trezor until they've received say 1BTC at which point that x goes to 0%?
It becomes a bit like a debit card company on steroids at this point but they'd be able to flog their product cheaply and yet be funded by all the transactions that use their HW.
I've not got a Trezor so not sure if this is how it works but thought I'd put the idea out there in case it inspires a way to counter the cheap clones ripping off all their hardwork.

Auroracoin in Iceland was tried... probably too pioneering at this stage as the wallets and tools need a lot of love before mainstream adoption is realistic.
State controlled chains are very likely to occur but they will be no different than todays fiat money other than it can be traded over the internet.  
Bitcoin lives above this layer and is more like a global reserve... if you can't trade your local money for bitcoin your local money will be pretty much worthless to the rest of the world.

Gavin's solution is an interim extension to what was a preventative temporary measure to reduce spam.  It's questionable if any block size limit is even needed given we also now have transaction fees and miners are always free to pick and choose which transactions they include in their block which already reduces spam.
The 20x increase is to prevent an oncoming general usage wall to continue low transaction fees and allow some more scaling.  It has highlighted a layer above bitcoin needs to exist to scale for mainstream adoption and there are real solutions already out there and a few under development.  Remember youtube, facebook, reddit, etc... and all internet companies need to adapt to scale and is a good problem to have!  Check out streamium.io as announced yesterday as one example that saves a bucket load of transactions from the chain via the micropayments channel approach. 
So why use bitcoin or a blockchain?  Imagine fiat didn't already exist, try to convince a person to use a fiat system over bitcoin would be a no brainer which is better (I'm not going into the blockchain without bitcoin debate).  
Because fiats do already exist and the private banking network is well established it makes it blurry as to why bitcoin does anything different until you take a step back to see the overall picture... private profit driven banks and institutions were historically needed to facilitate value storage and transactions, especially global ones... they are no longer required to do this so will start seeing fierce competition globally.  Whether it's bitcoin or another derived experiment is yet to be seen but there's no putting the genie back in the bottle and the technology is only going to keep getting stronger until one clicks and becomes mainstream.

If you buy $5 worth of bitcoin now it will get you a precise amount of bitcoin (probably something like 0.012btc).  You would now own 0.00000006% of the bitcoin that can ever exist in the world (assuming you have the private key because you've sent your bitcoin from the exchange to your bread or mycelium wallet so you actually own it).
That means people may offer you less or more USD for that fraction of the bitcoin resource.  Bitcoin's value is precise and fixed however, it's the exchange rate to other currencies that fluctuates based on the demand for bitcoin globally.
USD is currently the strongest currency out there so it's easy to get mixed up and overlook the relationship is the other way around when talking global commodities.  If you take something else like Venezuela bolivar as an extreme scenario you'll see it's the bolivar that is diving in value with respect to the average global reserve, meaning your exact same btc will get more bolivar today than you would have if you exchanged it yesterday.
In time it may be sensible to think of bitcoin as the tangible global reserve currency as this is far more intuitive.  Speculative  buying pressure mixed with public skepticism on how it has a future means we're a long way from this becoming blindingly apparent so bitcoin faces massive volatility whilst it matures.

To be fair, they're trying to say that centralised bitcoin exchanges or bitcoin banks can be fractionally reserved... exactly like high street banks do currently with all fiats.

Ponzi,tulip,hacks... Not generally positive words that sadly are mentioned time and time again by those who haven't studied it.
Also there is the human element of it being hard to grasp why digital money has value so easier dismiss. Even the smartest of financial people have to surmount that concept of 'why can't it just be created?' and what is so different from virtual money we've seen so many times before.
Lastly people who do study it and get excited want to share their knowledge/enthusiasm as it's quite a revelation but in doing so risk sounding like a nutter or preacher as it's something people need to learn and decide for themselves.

To do this you'd have to buy bitcoin mining hardware to actually mine them (CPU days of mining are long gone). That mining hardware is a significant investment to make any noticeable amount of money from it mixed with cheap electricity.
So I'd expect mining isn't really worth attempting but without being all negative here, if you have a bunch of semi reasonable machines I'd look at hooking them up and offering then as cheap VPS's to rent out for bitcoin and perhaps pre-install them with a full blockchain on it since that takes days to setup.

I didn't realize they were doing that, does that make the blocksize decision more relevant faster than expected?
I've not done one of these transactions myself but could miners simply calculate a higher fee for any transaction that has an OP_RETURN in it?  E.g. Charge a logarithmic value to allow market rates?
current fill percentage (CFR) = current size/Max block size 
factor = 25 BTC  (edit: formatting)
fee to add an OP_RETURN transaction = factor * (CFR * CFR) + 0.01 BTC.
I've not really thought this through so may be a daft idea and just asking in case it inspires a solution.  Guessing the current setup will be sufficient for their private traded needs but gut feel seems like public market trading using colored coins will require the blocksize limit to be resolved.

Sounds like you may have overwritten the file (although I'm unsure about putting a litecoin wallet into Bitcoin client so perhaps I've misunderstood what you have lost). 
If it's a lot of money in there a forensic lab may be able to retrieve it even when overwritten but it is costly.
Good luck on the recovery. If you get totally stuck and don't want to do the forensic route you can open the dat file in a hex editor to see what's in there to manually import them... You may be lucky and find some keys if you didn't encrypt it.

The accounts/balance system is a simple limited approach.  UTXO approach allows forth like scripts to be used to lock funds and allows for features banks can't support.
E.g. multisignature payments, escrow payments, contracts.
It also allows for future expansion for the sorts of transactions not considered when first designing bitcoin.  For example new OP codes can be added to the script system to allow for schnorr signatures or future cryptography not even discovered yet.
Basically allows it to be future proof and vastly more powerful than excel ;)

Given he needs to convince not just Greece but the entire worlds population that Bitcoin has no value I say good luck to him.
  It's much like proclaiming to the world niobium is worthless and not to consider buying it... Anyone who's not a chemist is likely to think 'meh, ok' but it only takes two people somewhere in the world to know its importance in steel works to give it value.
As others come to realise it has value too the market grows for this obscure element demanding a price much higher than any uninformed person would consider spending on it. 
Computer scientists in particular are excited about Bitcoin because they can see the global utility value, as others start to realise why it's finite and useful the market will grow regardless of what people say.

As you say, Bitcoin is not pegged to USD or any other single currency/commodity.  The US is just one of many countries out there and they have no more or less control over bitcoin than any other nation.
Whilst people are willing to trade USD for BTC there are also people willing to trade YEN/EURO/KSH/etc.. for BTC.  
Should the USD hyperinflate it simply means the USD is worth less to every other country hence people using USD will have to exchange more USD to buy one bitcoin whilst the rest of the world pays the same price they used to.   This isn't 100% accurate as many bitcoin owners are in America so many Americans may see it as a method to avoid loss of value during hyperinflation which would push btc's future value even higher but that's human psychology which gets difficult to model whereas the rest is pretty easy to see how it links together.
This means bitcoin is more akin to a global reserve currency since it's vastly faster to transfer than any other forex and has value everywhere around the world.
Clearly the volume is not even close for it to be seriously considered as a global reserve currency these days but if the experiment keeps tracking like it is this is an inevitable possibility unless an even better digital currency pops up.

If you are spending them you should probably store them on your smart phone if you have one as it's easier to trade with and harder for people to hack.  If you don't have a smartphone storing them on your PC is better than on some 3rd party website (except blockchain.info which is pretty good in that you still have the private key)
If you are storing any for long term storage it's best to be super secure and put these on paper with something like bitaddress.org or use electrum and write down the seed words followed by uninstalling it from your PC.

You're right that it uses encryption technology to generate that signature number in transactions thereby proving ownership of funds being transferred but this is very different from actual encryption which many see as a method of obscuring content.

Great work by Peter giving a snapshot of the wallets out there.  Would be helpful to say this test is going to be run again on say 1st April (seems an appropriate day for it).
Mycelium showing the transaction as risky until confirmed is a great idea.  "RBF" acronym is way too technical for users however, that should be in a 'more detail...' sort of section.  A simple message like "Warning, this transaction can be easily revoked until confirmed."
The bitcoind client should have the best implementation of best practice in to flag this so others know what to do.
Perhaps to help get the ball rolling, here is an awesome bit of JS code to detect an RBF flag in the transaction... will be great to see in bitcoinj/bitcore/cryptopay stuff include this simple test by default.
anyone wanting to see where the sequence number is in a transaction I can't recommend this site enough!

The finite 21million gets people interested, learning it's a new technology invention, not a fad can help reassure why this isn't all hype.  Common issues I had and others seem to have are...
Grasping bitcoins are best thought of like balances in a spreadsheet with 8 decimal places, I.e. There is no such things as coins.
Also wallets merely store your passwords (just an incredibly big number) to access your balances in this shared global spreadsheet.  Knowing the password to a balance means you can transfer your bitcoin to someone else from any computer connected to the Internet.
Transactions are nearly instant to detect and confirmations are only needed to ensure the funds are guaranteed to have transferred which takes 10
mins on average.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:53:56
Absolutely agree.  This 'cartel' approach is also only helpful on banning a specific set of funds... once one miner let them move (or mixing or sidechains or...) it's fair game again and those funds are unblocked... i.e. it could be done as a nuisance but unlikely to happen.  Look at what happened to all those coins from bitfinex for instance, everyone knows they were stolen but they can still move freely because censorship resistance was part of bitcoin's design.

Not if the store knew what they were doing.
Essentially a paper wallet is just storing the password allowing you to send the bitcoin to another address... this means someone could hand over the paper wallet and yet later transfer those funds from the wallet to another address making the paper wallet worthless.
Equally there is nothing stopping someone from printing out many copies of the identically same paper wallet to double spend the funds as well.  
Banks try to solve this with making the notes difficult to counterfeit but even with all that high tech printing (including the absolutely amazing Orion system subtly found on most notes around the world now) however they are still far from 100% secure.  
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:45:46
Would it be right to say that these measures are what cause a squeeze? IE if I the price starts to rise and reaches the fiat funds available in their account the commodity is instantly bought for them by the exchange as to avoid a their client owning more than they can afford.  This automatic buying causes the price to rise which causes more people to fall foul of the squeeze causing a chain reaction that gets expensive for shorters quickly.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:08:03
Good point about the ports, not considered that.
The encryption bit still sounds feasible, I mean the encrypted data merely means make the packet encrypted from the isp's perspective, not from anyone analysing the traffic or in the blockchain. I.e encrypt transactions with the hash used say 10 blocks previously. Once a node receives an encrypted transaction it decodes it and relays the transaction on to the network unencrypted as normal.
This way any oppressive Isp couldn't easily identify/filter transactions without users needing to worry about vpns or the like.

If you want to mine for money please don't waste your time.  You'll need some seriously hefty ASICs (min 500Ghash/second)  that will set you back a small fortune to make a meagre ROI over 12 months if you don't burn your dorms down in the process.
Bitwisdom charts will calculate your return for you if you're set on trying to make money.  To do anything of any significance you'll be needed a several thousand dollars to get started.
If you want to do mining just to understand it, buy a miner off of ebay.  It'll probably cost more in electricity than it generates in bitcoin but you can go through the process of doing it. Typically they're plug and play but you'll have to attach to a pool and understand that process to get started... highly recommend it as it's fascinating but just don't expect to make anything more than a few dollars out of it all.
If you actually want to make bitcoin the best bet is offering to do work for bitcoin... far easier than mining especially with the halving coming in the next few months!

Fair comment and great to see a tool to test this out with!
May I ask, does the double spend work because miners will replace the original transaction for one with a higher fee (as I have been under the impression they'd always take the first they see on the network to minimize this type of attack) or is it because of another reason?  
I.e. perhaps the first transaction is never accepted by a miner due to the blacklisting by some mining nodes (thereby playing a chance game on which mining pool solves the block) or because 2 or more transactions can be in the 'awaiting to confirm' block draining the same transaction inputs?

So just to confirm I've understood this...
I could run node.js locally, install bitcore-lib and be up and running able to make my own wallet on my node.js server if I handle creating the HD private keys myself.
At a later stage I could choose to run bitcoind locally and install bitcore-wallet-service to migrate to a local version where there is absolutely no dependency on bitpay's servers?  (Not that I plan on this bit but just in case the servers became unavailable for instance).
If so, this is precisely what I've been searching for!! (This and the ability to use webhooks for notifications of payments received).

I would expect the blocksize will remain at 1Mb cap unless there is a catastrophic event making an increase of interest to the miners.
We are not even close to a serious annoyance yet as the global price is holding strong even with the discussions around blocksize.  The system still holds water when under spam attacks via increased fees and there are new protocols built on top of bitcoin that allow for vast scalability in the pipeline... we need some pressure to make these higher level protocols work now so keeping it fixed to a tiny 1Mb seems sensible until there is an incentive for miners to increase the size (i.e. higher level protocols start earning more than miners for instance).  It also makes sure wallets handle fees correctly as many have been doing an unsustainable approach of paying a minimal anti-spam fee which will not help bitcoin in the decades to come.
When the blocksize increase does happen I'd love to see Gavin's approach of an algorithmic increase adopted as seems the most sensible long term approach.  The worst solution would be a fixed increase, e.g. 2Mb, as it just kicks the can down the road when even more will be riding on it.

I'm not sure how easy it is for a merchant to detect it's a greenaddress transaction (perhaps the xpub key is known to all?)  Possibly they should offer integration to bitpay and others to bring 0 conf to the masses.

At around 21% signalling litecoin is behind bitcoin's signalling at the moment which is a total surprise!.
If the litecoin segwit code is ready, why are the miners not jumping on it?  
The litecoin miners would do incredibly well adopting it because it will make litecoin's value appreciate and could potentially eclipse bitcoin if LN and segwit starts working on it from the outset.
I know I'd consider moving my funds there AFTER they get segwit enabled because a LN implementation would be a stones throw away after that.
(It would also be a good test to run before bitcoin adopted it)

1. There are a few options. Centralised services like Circle should all support going past the 100kTPS threshold relatively easily since they're just local DB updates.
A more decentralised approach is the lightning network but this is a long time away from becoming a mainstream option as it's still not even released yet but does look promising for microtransactions.
My preference is sidechains and/or tree chains as these would allow an unlimited number of transactions but my hunch is centralised systems will be the norm for many years yet as most users are familiar to using a bank and want a simple on/off ramp.  Central systems allow for the 'undo' features and someone else handling the security that a centralised system makes necessary.  
Not saying it's the best long term solution but simplicity usually wins people over.  
Those who want (or need) to really understand bitcoin are the ones who'll go deeper and want to manage the keys themselves hence lightning and sidechains are likely to become more prevalent over time as more businesses use decentralisation to their advantage.

I must stress that excel analogy is a good starting point to understanding and is close to what's happening for 90% of transactions but isn't really how it works.  
Instead each transaction is actually a script and you need to satisfy the parameters of that script to create a new transaction that spends the bitcoin amount held by that original transaction.  
Usually a specific type of transaction is used hence why the excel analogy works, but in practice it allows for vastly more complicated things like multisignature payments, escrows, time locked payments, open payments, tagged items for representing shares or datastore, etc...   
It's incredibly powerful if you get to the guts of it all and direct payments is just one small part of why the network is so disruptive to the financial world.

You wallet typically holds the private key numbers which are used to create the public key numbers.  These public key numbers are hashed and written in base58 with some checksum info to get your addresses.  This is what the wallet shows, the addresses you can spend funds from.


Yes, that's correct.


Pick a random number out of the air, this is your private key.  Derive your address from this and ask people to send bitcoin to this address in exchange for services, items of value or products.  TBH most people allow the wallet to derive these private keys as it's faaaar easier.  Usually that private key is derived in a mathematical way from a seed value so you can create many addresses based on a sequence from this seed.  These numbers are so incredibly vast you'll never guess anyone elses, that's part of the trick!


You don't need to be connected to the internet to derive a bitcoin address to ask people to send funds to... the entire process can be done without a computer if you really wanted.  Only spending from an address requires access to the P2P network.


No, addresses are merely like rows in an excel spreadsheet and there are 2^255 addresses.  A bitcoin isn't a thing as such, it's merely a balance held in an address, i.e. the value of bitcoins is held in the excel cell at that row.  The total of bitcoins can never exceed 21million (actually 15 million at the moment since there are still 6 million not in circulation yet)


On the side of this reddit are some helpers to look at.  


I'm so curious about all this but am Hitting mental road blocks.

Yes, this is normal.
Private keys starting with an L or K are just compressed private keys whereas keys starting with a '5' are uncompressed ones.
Whilst when you look at them they look the same, compressed keys take less space in the blockchain hence may offer lower fees when spending the funds there.
They are identical in security level.

I'm loving the simplicity in use of this service but a few suggestion have popped up...
1) Have a 'free preview' time or at least a couple of screenshots of what the webcam is showing for the last 60 seconds.  I don't want to rip anyone off because the cat rat off.
2) Allow a customer review system so people know if the stream is what they say it is... right now people have to pay before they view  so expect many won't click.
3) Allow chat messages to people.  With no emails being used having a chat system is imperative for this to take off.
4) I've noticed it says I've earned more money than what has actually been delivered to the btc wallet... this seems like a transaction bug?  I.e. it says you've earned 50cents for this session but at the end only a fraction of 1 cent has so far been delivered (this is after pressing the 'end broadcast' button).
5) The minimum rate looks a lot higher than $1/hr.  I entered $1 but it seems to say $14/hr when I click on the viewing link.  I assume this is the minimum bar that ramped the $1 to $14 but that should be clearer.
Overall it's very impressive first use I've seen on micropayment channel system in a practical way so massive Kudos to them pulling this off.

When you create your vanity address you will have created a private key that generated your vanity address.
You can now import that private key to many wallets such that you'll be able to spend from it but in practice this is a bad idea.  The reason it's bad is most wallets these days are HD wallets, which essentially means it's generating a new address each time you spend funds.  This new address receives all your change.  It's a prudent security feature because if someone were to ever break the publickey-&gt;priv key problem they'd have access to any funds on the blockchain that are reusing addresses.
(Whilst currently and the foreseeable future this is not an issue, it is just a recommendation).
The other issue is that many wallets go nuts when you import a private key as it may try to spend funds from some of the transactions sent to it BUT NOT ALL!.  This can make your wallet do some really weird UI (like saying you've spend all your money only for all your money to reappear later.
Finally the last issue is it can be tricky knowing who sent you what.  If two people were to send you funds of say 0.01btc you'll have very way of knowing who's paid and who hasn't.  Again HD wallets solve this.
Therefore the best thing for vanity addresses is simply a novelty to share the address online anywhere you want to receive anonymous donations from.  At some point in the future you sweep the value stored there to your HD wallet (most good wallets support sweeping from a private key) rather than directly import the private key to an existing wallet.

He is not technical and doesn't really understand why it has value beyond it being a limited commodity hence bundles all blockchains together.
Kudos to him learning about it early on and writing a reasonably well informed summary for a non-technical writer but recently he's fallen into the 'yay blockchain' camp because he doesn't grasp the technical and economic issues driving it forward or more likely is being misled by private ventures such as R3 who need him to believe they have a better solution than an open source one.
"“It may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it’s the banks for sure,"  Tim Swanson.... just like to point out they announced they too have figured out the blockchain isn't for them because a blockchain is not about solving the micropayment layer.
Listening to him explaining mining to a group of bankers last year was shocking.  Most walked away with the impression that Bitcoin is now run by the Chinese gov and will eventually print themselves billions of coins whilst blocking other nations from using it.  I don't know if that's what he honestly believes that or if he just conveyed it incorrectly but he couldn't be more wrong if he tried.
Either way, I think Nathaniel has done a good job on introducing Bitcoin to a lot of mainstream voices however he would do well having someone technical to help explain LN, sidechains and other open source developments in the works that are the reason why people see bitcoin having long term value that can't simply be applied to any blockchain.

I clicked on a couple of those and both had time of previous block is less than 1 minute (and remember that time is approximate, not exact so could have been seconds between the blocks being found).  I.e. that subsequent block was probably made before any new transactions were validated and processed to be included in the block header sent out to the miners to work on.  Remember the blocks before those 0 transaction blocks were far from full so there was nothing to carry over to the next block.
I.e. I think it's quite likely most of those 0 blocks were not malicious at all and just how the network handles things.

You're correct about the maximum but you need to realise it's not a 1d function but 2d one involving time since interest is not instant.
IE those 21 million are not held by the same people as time progresses.
Does that mean 1% extra will ever exist? In the economy no, but in a users balance yes. Someone may lend their Bitcoin out now knowing they'll get more back later. The person borrowing the btc will make more use of the funds now to earn btc from someone else later (hence how the lender eventually gets 1%)  eg get a loan to buy chickens now to sell eggs to willing buyers later.
Where it falls apart is when interest loans are made to people using the funds to pay for consumables to survive... That's a recipe for problems.

Checking Google, NYSE and Yahoo, all seem to say otherwise and allow me to indulge a little in sharing my current thoughts on why.  
It could well be a mass disillusion tulip ponzi scheme aimed at the weak minded computer engineers, it is merely an experiment after all.  
My take on it is many of these same people who see vast potential for bitcoin understand computers simply manipulate and store numbers, can do if statements on those numbers and loops... that's it really,  not very exciting eh?  Imagine in the 1960's explaining to someone how these concepts of manipulating numbers could have any effect on the rest of the world without being laughed at?  Clearly it has with nearly every human having access to a computer and the fact we're communicating with them right now shows they've proved incredibly useful, some may say essential to humans now.  
These bitcoin numbers have worth and the missing link in that there has been no way to have a global finite digital resource anyone can transfer until bitcoin was invented, this is why it has real value.  The value attributed to bitcoin is arguably more valuable than any other found on the the internet so far since it's the first item that can not be copied.
I know this comes across preachy for which I apologise and if you've made your mind up it's worthless who am I to convince you otherwise but just highlighting why I think you should reconsider why others do see it having extraordinary value in the internet era.

* International payments made easily without ridiculous forex fees as the system becomes more established.

At the moment there is an upper cap of around 3 tx/second.  This means to make an entry on the blockchain soon it'll become a market to where transactions with higher fees take priority over the lower fee ones.
The alternative is to make the blocks bigger to allow more transactions per second.
There are two main issues I'm aware of.  Firstly both keeping 1mb block AND extending the blocks will still allow bitcoin function.  The difference is having a finite blocksize will change bitcoin's purpose from a general ledger to a settlement or larger value transaction one... i.e. we won't be seeing purchases of deep fried hamsters from Peru appearing there.  This forces new innovation/layers on top of bitcoin to handle these micro transactions and scale well.  E.g. Lightning network, sidechains, trusted wallet services, etc..  
The alternative is we keep growing the blocks and this can go on for quite some time HOWEVER it eventually will reach a limit based on diskspace issues, bandwidth issues, etc.. 
Therefore there is an argument to go through this upper bound pain limit now while bitcoin is small enough that it's not dramatic so it does become unlimited in uses via these additional layers.
Ultimately miners choose which option bitcoin will support (1Mb or allowing larger blocks).  Right now we're still in the 1Mb size because there is nothing to fix.
If bitcoin prices dramatically plummet miners may be inclinded to adopt XT or another branch that does allow bigger blocks so it really is a storm in a teacup.  It is trivial to increase the block size whenever the miners want.
I want to see a solution/layer where 1,000,000 transactions per second in a trustless way can be sustainably achieved... without this it opens bitcoin up to an altcoin that will support it in the years to come.
Holding onto the 1Mb bound to force this solution now and testing what happens when an upper bound is reached is sensible to do in this experiment before big money is riding on it.
Either way bitcoin will scale massively soon.

@_date: 2017-02-08 11:59:33
I'm not aware of any such scheme, surprising someone hasn't done it already but you'd need a stock to invest in that invested in bitcoin.
The reason it may not be as easy as we think is that an ISA is a good way to encourage people to give up their savings and donate it to a bank or invest in other businesses.  
The cash ISA gives your money to the bank with the intention you won't touch it for some time so they can use it to lend out safely thereby helping boost the economy.  
The stocks and shares ISAs is to lend to businesses which is higher risk to you but can offer the larger potential upside.  Again it helps the economy so encouraged.  
Investing in commodity based resources like metals and bitcoin, well it's just securing your value for yourself... not really sure why the government would offer a tax benefit incentive to do this so I don't think they do.
What they can do however is allow you to invest in an ETF if it existed since these are sort of businesses.

Your funds are safe even in the advent of a fork.  All transactions that happened before the fork are identical, transactions after the fork are vast majority identical.  E.g. if you transmit your paper wallet coins during a contentious fork period that transaction automatically goes to BOTH chains.
Where it gets messy is for the miners or if you send/receive coins from a tx that has only appeared on one chain and not the other (post fork) or doesn't include enough of a fee to be included in one chain but is in the other.  
I struggle to see how a minority coin in bitcoin could survive in the long run, especially if an exchange allows for shorting. There would be a financial incentive to extract all the market cap from the minor chain quickly and the miners supporting that minor chain earn even less which causes a chain reaction of shorting becomes more profitable and miners go out of business if they continue supporting the weaker chain.

I read it as they're asserting it would make the network unstable from an economic point of view, however I too don't see why that would be the case.

A global reserve currency is a common unit of value for trading between countries, this therefore *should* be independent of a 3rd party country to avoid the Triffin paradox and unfair advantages it offers...  The USD was supposed to be exactly that, it was adopted on the premise that it was pegged to gold at $1 = 1/38oz hence voted in over the more robust Bancor system in the Bretten Woods agreements. 
That worked well for 30 years until 1972 when Nixon got stuck with this inevitable Triffin dilemma and without the reserves necessary was forced to 'temporarily' put the gold standard on hold.... Fast forward 40 years later and the gold standard still hasn't returned and that $1 on a free floating market is now worth a mere 3% of what it was in 1972 ( I.e. will only buy 1/1300 oz of gold ).
Bitcoin however could be seen as more akin to the metre, watt, litre.  I.e. no one controls the supply, we know it's fixed to 21m and therefore the amount describes a precise normalised store of value that can be translated to a local currency by simply multiplying a number.
That value can be transferred instantly between countries... it's hard to describe a better unit for a reserve currency given it's properties are perfect.  
Right now it's not even close to being used for this purpose and I know this idea will be laughed out by anyone in the fx field because it's just waaay too abstract.  Unless something usurps bitcoin however, I for one see it as inevitable because I would prefer to store value that is instantly accessible in something that doesn't devalue via dilution, fiats (and worse still bank accounts) will never be able to offer that by their very definition of being a fiat currency.

Actually there is a 3rd way that's just occurred to me...
Mine with &gt; 51% and simply revert that transaction.
This could actually be done in two approaches.  Firstly GHash, BTC Guild + others agreeing to reprocess the blockchain from a given block number EXCLUDING the theft transaction(s) and replacing it with a signed transaction from the private key holder to send the coins to the miners instead.  Yes the exchange would still have lost the coins BUT the thief wouldn't have them either so there is less incentive to steal large funds like this.
This may cause some trust concerns with the main pools colluding like this so the other approach is the biggest pool operator actually turns off all their hardware (KnC I'm looking at you ;)).  This will cause the hash rate to drop.  They keep all this hardware turned off but keep ramping up the powered off hardware to ensure they have 51% of the network power at a moments notice.
Now when a scenario like this pops up they offer to turn on all their mining equipment to rewrite the block chain in exchange for half the funds + running costs required to rewrite the chain (i.e. the faster they're alerted to rewriting it the cheaper it is).
Exchanges could fund this sleeping mining operation to cover it's costs when idle.

The people working there will have taken that job because they are wanting to do the right thing for society.
I'd be incredibly surprised any would steal bitcoin (ignoring the few exceptions that statistically may happen and get highlighted, i.e. the bad apple effect).  The issue is that if weaknesses are built into hardware or software those exploits can be used by nefarious actors when discovered... those people will want to steal bitcoin because... well it's the most valuable asset on the internet so why not.

The article is incredibly misleading, the number of bitcoins being mined is still exactly the same and your understanding is spot on.  
Because more and more computers are working on hashing the block solutions are currently being found slightly faster than 1 every 10 minutes on average, say a block is being found every 9minutes for instance (based on the time taken to mine the last 2016 blocks).  The network therefore increases the mining difficulty by 10% to ensure future blocks are mined at one every 10 minutes again.   
No reduction in supply and miners are still earning the same amount of btc as before, actually they're doing rather well because the exchange value has gone up so quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:23:26
Getnewaddress sounds sensible and I use that too.
I use bitcoin.conf notifications to trigger the events however to later query the values using getTransaction
e.g. when a new tx arrives it runs the script to make sure I'm aware there are incoming funds.
When a new block is found it verifies the confirmations of those tx's to know if we can be sure it has been received safely.
TX malleability is something to be aware of though, it's what I lose sleep over because I'm not sure how to easily test this.
Your approach with get received by address is probably fine, keep us posted how it goes.

That is the part I'm referring to, bitcoin can not be attacked in this way (at least in a sustained way).
If you create a valid transaction on your computer with sufficient fees, there is literally nothing anyone can do about it to prevent that transaction from eventually being recorded in bitcoin.
Reversing it from the history is even less likely unless it was dependent on a yet discovered bug.
Basically bitcoin is completely censorship resistent at the lowest level.  It is however experiencing issues with fungibility on exchanges due to all transactions history being publically visible... again this is likely to change if people keep using services like elliptic.

"other good ways to increase my BTC amount with trading or selling service/products/mytime"
May like to consider BTCJam and the likes if you really want to.  That's the 'safest' way but even that has high risks.
Unless you're an experienced trader (and even then) trading is gambling.  Honestly no different than tea leaf reading regardless to how it's dressed up as a professional discipline.  The only difficulty in trading is having the balls to do the opposite of what the market is doing... most of the time you'll get it right but those few occasions you don't... ouch. Unless you have inside knowledge it's almost certain you'll lose your money day trading due to bots and those who can manipulate the market.
Best way to earn more bitcoin is the exact same way you'd earn any other cash, which is a good thing I guess.

Brute forcing a private key is not feasible however hand picked brain wallets are because people are rubbish at picking random things.  These take the words and convert them to a number which is the private key.
Another approach is you can hash some text using common hashing techniques like SHA256 and use the produced number as the private key.
These routes are certainly possible to find used private keys, I stumbled on one by chance once upon a time by doing an SHA256 of the text 'testing' I think it was and ta-dah, someone else had once used this.  There are also stories of people losing funds by using these but luckily I think these techniques are now known to be a dangerous way to pick your private key.
p.s. The public key (and therefore the bitcoin address) is derived from the private key.
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:36:56
That was answered by better compression schemes, faster hardware but most importantly wider adoption of the internet.  
I believe the internet actually performs better as adoption grows as it enables more pathways for the traffic to flow through... a consensus P2P system seems to grow linearly with the number of transactions as every node needs to know about every confirmed transaction, at least it does in it's current set up.  
I know it will be able to cope in a myriad of ways but I'm curious which solution people currently foresee being the predominant one to scale with.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:03:13
Agreed and to add to this... every time the block size is manually updated it means miners are likely to upgrade to the latest version which would also bring with it any other changes they may or may not want to support OR they need to maintain a different branch.

I'd only ever condone PoW change if SHA256 was compromised.   If people don't like bitcoin being controlled by SHA256 miners, simply exchange your coins for another alt coin.  If that alt coin has better economics driving it the value will eventually be stronger than bitcoin... this isn't rocket science.

My first thought is its daft battery drain but then I realised it could be genuinely good... Imagine it only mines when fully charged and plugged in. Ie the user wouldn't even notice. Connectivity already there, minimal host power, no maintenance, regularly updated chips every year... It'll be more sustainable than mining farms. With $1mil per day on the tables soon to be 0.5m and they have to be less than 50% network hash to avoid crashing the price means $250k per day at today's prices... Not to be scoffed at.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:36:44
My interpretation of compromised is sha256(x)=y and I can trivially solve x for a given y. 
Removing this pow feature is like replacing the safety fuse with a nail.  It may work but now you can do a lot more dangerous things later with that scary contraption.
For instance you adopt cuckoo, something that has never been proven elsewhere and could potentially be compromised.  Secondly you reset everyone to a level playing field again but now power players who realise how robust and uncontrollable bitcoin is have a second chance at controlling it. They can ramp up vastly faster than avg Joe and hide behind a vail of pools.  Now you have a malicious entity controlling the system and no one would know.
 By all means let's make a new chain with new pow and get everyone who think bitcoin is stuffed move onto this new one but don't try to do open heart surgery on a system that is still working exactly as designed but just doesn't match someone elses view of bitcoin.
I'm not arguing the point btw, bitcoin has a mind of its own and fork or no fork it won't matter our opinion.  I too want to see innovation and LN but I'm not ready to condone destroying parts that are working when there are simple options available.

It was a geographically denominated coin, people outside of Iceland could not get any in the genesis block but you're right it was a private venture.
There was also a Hull coin piloted by a local gov in the UK.  Not sure how well it performed and expect it also had pioneering issues in that the user friendliness of the wallets and merchant tools need to be much easier for general public daily use.  (i.e. hiding those addresses, instant payments, merchant adoption, simple local currency exchange via banks or shops,etc..)
Will be fascinating to watch as bigger projects start being developed.  I think all these projects have shown alt coins are very difficult to get to bootstrap value and trust in, creating them as side chains of the strongest chain (i.e. bitcoin) appears far more likely to succeed based on these past ventures.
@_date: 2016-03-27 08:12:51
Probably best to ask in but be aware that many people in there are smart but deluded gamblers believing in fibonacci sequences/macd lines/etc... the more you understand the 'science' of trading, the more apparent it becomes why people suddenly jump out of windows when their infallible system goes to shit and they had no idea it would happen.
That said, there are sensible ways to make money trading if you have prior knowledge to an event (e.g. you know something the general population don't)
Shorting. Something bad on the cards?  You detected a hardfork starting?  
Here you borrow some bitcoin from someone, sell it, keep the fiat currency for a while (like days) and purchase the bitcoin back later to return to who you borrowed from.  
Going long.  When you think bitcoin is going up you hold it.  Pretty much what everyone does to begin with or those who believe bitcoin has bigger potential uses than what it currently is used for.
Volatility.  You can leverage any movement.  Not sure how to explain this other than you borrow money from someone to do a massive amount of going long or short in a small window of time.  
If however bitcoin price goes up or down too much against you, your margin gets called automatically to settle your debt on the loan you owe and you lose all your money.  You make a lovely stream of money in the short term as the price bounces around within a window and all is peachy... when it does go wrong (and it will) you lose everything.
  
Arbitrage.  Find a place that you can buy bitcoin for price X and somewhere that you can sell your bitcoin for (X+extra). Using this and leverage you can make money from small price differences when greater than the exchange fees.
Two exchanges regularly have this in times of large price movements.  Typically the part here that is slow is banking system.  You'll find you can move bitcoin almost instantly however getting the fiat back out from the exchange followed by banking system takes DAYS, perhaps longer when talking foreign currencies and volatility in forex prices &amp; fees.  So whilst you may see a lovely 4% spread to earn cash out of and think you're about to be a millionaire, the archaic banking system prevents this to happen because it's so slow and shyte which is why the spread exists at all.
A note however, decentralised exchanges may really mess this up for the banks.  If they work successfully they may allow fiat arbitrage to be in minutes thereby making bitcoin a stronger currency than fiats.  Will be interesting to watch what happens when people discover this.
One thing to note about forex, it's NOT regulated as it's an OverTheCounter (OTC) asset meaning anyone can trade it.  It is the wild west regardless to what the tabloids say.  Banks simply pluck a figure out of the air as the exchange rate.  They can't be too wild as there is competition and arbitrage prevents this but when big banks are the main source of forex trading there is nothing to stop them colluding and say picking a time when the exchange rate will be set yet they have prior knowledge of what it will be set to so take their long/short position respectively.  Essentially the only people guaranteed to make money are the banks hence the 'scandle' when this was discovered to be happening.
IMHO Digital currencies will make forex fairer for all as they become more mainstream in time.

I disagree, the miners make and secure the very coins your attribute value to.  If we were to ignore those miners it's saying the bitcoin's have somehow obtained magically powers and the numbers have tangible value.  
I for one would see those numbers as worthless.  BTW, I'm not trying to say a counter point for the fun of it, I really think this concept of thinking the miners are slaves to the system is like saying umbrellas going up summons the rains.  It may look true but if you take a step back you can see what's really happened here.
Bitcoin has value because we perceive it to be secure... rip out the key security element and it's a just another alt coin with lost reputation.
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:47:38
I agree, I think this is a good approach too.  Electrum gear is excellent  too and libbitcoin is apparently excellent too.  Bitpay is absolutely incredible but means you have to rely on their services so doesn't fit all situations for corporate use.
Could you share some pointers on how you recommend securing RPC?
E.g is setting the whitelist IPs in the configuration file to known interfacing computer(s) considered sufficient or is it better to only allow 127.0.0.1 with SSH Tunnel.  Run it on tails, etc..
My fear is the unknown and because people rarely share their best practices at risk of ridicule I feel there is always new approaches to learn.
My approach is to use bitcoind with RPC too but make sure it's only ever a hot wallet.
I also wrote a custom JS rest Api that handles ALL RPC calls so I can treat it as a 'warm wallet' in that the JS will transfer excess funds to a multisig wallet and notify admins to manually top up the warm wallet when low.  Ie the most that can be stolen is a small fraction of the deposits.

What scenario do you see as requiring a change in policy? I expect only if sha256 was totally compromised with instant solutions would this be a possibility. (Incredibly unlikely)

As long as you have the private key (or seed) your coins will exist in BOTH chains.  It's like a double your money sort of thing except one of those chains will likely become worthless.
So worse case is you end up with the same number of coins you originally had, best case is you get some free money from suckers buying into an alt coin.

I think the idea of this is great but may I suggest you put *a lot* of reassurance that the feeds are actively monitored (allowing users to also report content) and that anything that would get viewers into trouble is actively reported to authorities to discourage anything unethical from being done.  Until I know of this reassurance I won't be clicking that link.
For instance, without this step it could send humanity back to the gladiator pits of the past or worse.
Desperate people do a lot of horrible things for money.
On a more positive note, I would have thought there are many other uses for this such as
* Multicams at sports events.  Broadcasters could then earn money because they are picking the best feeds to cut to.
* Car cams, people leave their phone and others can click a gps location (or google automatically does it for their street view) to view the live car cams at that position to gauge traffic.
* Weather cams from around the world including middle of the ocean that charge a higher price.  Fishermen might find this a useful income.

You are storing your value by owning part of a finite resource that other people value.
Only while people will trade for that resource does it have value.  Bitcoin is global so demand will always exist, weirdly that demand is more spatial than currency which is normally very localised to a specific country.
Bitcoin is unlikely to ever displace a national currency given a national currency makes a lot of sense.  It could become a global reserve currency over something like USD, YEN, EUR.  It has a lot of ideal features for a global reserve currency namely.
* Not controlled by any individual or nation.  
* Supply and inflation is known and finite so you know it can't be diluted.
* Instantly transferable anywhere on the globe.
* No storage fees
* Allows funds to be locked until n of m agree to make the transaction ( likely useful for corporations and nations where you want to make sure funds are secure against rogue individuals )
* Open for anyone to understand, use and build on... transparency.
* 24/7 access from any internet connected computer
* Low transaction fees
* Incredibly secure

So LN transactions are real bitcoin transactions, it's just that they are mostly not broadcast to hit the bitcoin blockchain until there is a breakdown in trust or it's time to settle due to the payment locks.
I'd be surprised if miners had a view one way or another on it, they will still receive their mining fees and if they wanted larger mining fees they can either increase the value of bitcoin or increase the volume.   Clearly increasing the volume isn't trivial so other solutions like LN are in miners interests too.
If LN with Bitcoin doesn't work out for whatever reason, it seems pretty likely either another currency that can scale will come along.
I'd also expect this future currency can only really be obtained by exchanging bitcoin for it since bitcoin has bootstrapped digital currencies having value on the internet.
I.e. I'm not sure bitcoin as it is right now is the long term digital cash solution, but it certainly looks like it will be the backbone of whatever it is.

Bitcoin wouldn't be worth what it is now if you hadn't sold them and made a profit at 100$.
You buying in when it was $1/btc is no different to buying in now at $1000/btc.  You had no idea at the time how valuable there could be and made a profit from the involvement you had at that stage.  I.e. don't kick yourself, you could still buy in again now, still have the same doubts as to if it's going to go up, still potentially sell at $5k/btc thinking that's a good profit, it could go higher or lower... 
You've done well so far and an early user, be proud of that.  If you think it still has further to go in it's potential perhaps get involved again.  
Remember the guy at the SEC said 'I have no idea what this Bit Coin is' just the other week... it still is very early days for this technology.

Yes, but I believe that's precisely how money works though.
People exchange things with others, usually to earn or spend stored value.  If it was just given to people it's hard to know how it has any tangible value.
If everyone around the world could be given an equal amount it would help but what about new people?  Is population increase the accepted inflation rate?  What happens to dead people's money that entered the economy?  Should it be removed? Ideally yes but how?
  It's an interesting dilemma, if we could find a way to solve a sybil attack it may stand a chance but currently mining seems the best answer we have to bootstrap it such that anyone can do it this way but most will think it's too expensive as they (rightly so) look at today's value to local currency.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:24:19
so you know the domain   
would you like it?? How much will you give me for it...
That's sort of how bitcoin derives it's price except it's not a single one off item administered by a DNS corporation, instead it's a finite resource just like webdomain names BUT it isn't issued or controlled by any single individual/group/corporation, instead anyone can control some if they can find someone else who's willing to trade theirs with you.
Typically people will trade for items they find useful such as local currency.
Scale this up and you find exchanges help facilitate this swap of value.  that's all there is to it really.   
Bitcoin is the first finite asset on the internet that can't be copied but anyone can own a share of it.

They're typically just alt coins but backed by a company and usually closed access.
They have he same inherent problems of alt coins (lack of proof of work security, maintenance issues). They do however solve the bootstrapping/early adopter problem most alt coins encounter by the using their clients or internal data with a lot of cash. They can also add new features easily since they control it but the idea of no undo (one of bitcoin strengths) is going to be too scary for most corporations to ever accept so will likely have inherent trust issues of these undo controllers.

    "Competent authorities should be able to monitor the use of virtual currencies in order to identify suspicious activities."
Well, there you go... that's how little they understand the tech yet making laws about it.
That single line, if adhered to, hinders the key aspect of a global currency... fungibility.   Whilst focusing attention on the insignificant nefarious usecases they've missed the bigger picture.
That statement, whilst I'm sure was well intended, is for ensuring blanket surveillance happens so they've now given a boost to make all transactions untraceable.  Why?  Well because the only people who would use these regulated services would be law abiding citizens.
 
The nefarious uses, well they'll can already use alternatives that are untraceable and can filter those coins into the economy using direct txs.  Don't want them to?  Making maths like ZKPs illegal wont stop them anyway, they were criminals before so why would they care about another geospecific law on creating some numbers and publishing them on the internet.  
Moving forward to us law abiding citizens using something like bitcoin, I don't want to receive coins that could possibly be tainted and therefore worthless.  I've now got an incentive to ensuring the coins I receive have the same value as any other coin so I'm now in favour of received funds coming with obscurity as standard??!
Also think years ahead as digital currencies are used for settlement between nations, do you think those two nations want to publicly share these sums to the EU?
What their advice has just done however is expedite the need for obscurity such as ZKP, LN, mixing and other solutions as default standard thereby losing the visibility on well researched and spear headed investigations.  This approach may no longer be possible with obscurity now needing to be built into the protocol.
Single hand clap to the EU team for that masterpiece of crime prevention.
Some interesting highlights:
(6)  Providers of exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies (that is to say currencies declared to be legal tender) as well as custodian wallet providers for virtual currencies are under no obligation to identify suspicious activity. Terrorist groups are thus able to transfer money into the Union's financial system or within virtual currency networks by concealing transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on those platforms. It is therefore essential to extend the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849 so as to include virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers. Competent authorities should be able to monitor the use of virtual currencies. This would provide a balanced and proportional approach, safeguarding technical advances and the high degree of transparency attained in the field of alternative finance and social entrepreneurship.
(7)  The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes. In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies taking up and their potential benefits to spread. The inclusion of virtual exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without exchange platforms or custodian wallet providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.
(8)  Local currencies (also known as complementary currencies) that are used in very limited networks such as a city or a region and among a small number of users should not be considered as virtual currencies.

In some ways I wish they would, it's incredibly easy to extract funds from a lower hash rate minority chain.  Simply short the heck out I'd it, sell your funds to drive the price down a bit, swap earnings with more old ₿ that exists in both chains, rinse and repeat (while many others do the same) making a profit each cycle until it's not worth doing or shorting drys up.

If you have a specific service you can offer online you could always try posting to job4bitcoin or on bitcointalk or other such bitcoin related site. (e.g. beta testing, researching topics, reviewing work, offering escrow services, helping on an existing project/work) 
If you want to actually sell items you can take a look at bitify.com and other such auction sites.  (OpenBazaar looks a promising place to earn bitcoin when it's released so learn how that works now whilst it's in testing).
Finally you can just earn money in your local currency and convert it to bitcoin using services like circle/coinbase/uphold/bitstamp/kraken/etc...

Worth discussing ideas but I agree this would be unworkable in practice.
Firstly you'd have to nominate a block that was allowed to be 20mb such as if the block height was a multiple of 1008. Such a change requires a hf which is intentionally being avoided when possible.
Next, everyone would fight for that mega block because it's up to 20x reward fees.
Also it makes blocks inconsistent rules which is in elegant, it is simply a hack to fix one problem that will inevitably uncover another issue now or later such as a new attack vector.
Finally it's in the miners interest to find the ceiling people will pay fees for.  This adds an hour create layer of complexity the miners will preferring avoid.

In the scenario of a Dr Evil demonstrating they are trying to destroy the very system they have invested millions into, people should vote with moving their funds to another coin.  This increase in supply devalues bitcoin, increases the value of another coin(s) and economics does the rest.  Devaluing the coin also punishes the miners for malicious behaviour so they therefore change or go out of business.
Pretending that changing the PoW mechanism whilst there is contention is misguided IMHO.  The fork is likely to fail due to the economic drivers but be incredibly messy during the process with many attack vectors opened up.  I guess what I'm saying is this mid-chain pow change seems to defeat the entire purpose of PoW which is to prevent weaker consortiums trying to overthrow bitcoin's protocol.
Also it makes me question if SegWit is even required... hear me out.   The purpose of segwit is a hack to split the witness data out but it is not how we'd design a new coin now if we didn't have the legacy constraints in bitcoin.  Therefore if someone made a coin that did witness data correctly from the outset, included opaque transaction capability, kept the 21mil limit, fixed supply rate, dynamic blocksize and allowed for sidechains easily it would get my vote for becoming an even more powerful backbone than bitcoin.
I see the PoW is only as powerful as those who trust their value to the chain.

LN can scale to vast numbers with 1Mb blocks.  Yes it will eventually need bigger blocks to cope with everyone in the world using it but it's a vast order of magnitude improvement on tx rate.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:29:50
I'm happy to be convinced otherwise and want to hear all sides of the argument so right now my take on it is this so people can pick out flaws in my logic or see if I'm talking sense...
Bitcoin is incredibly secure because you need vast amounts of equipment and electricity to influence the bitcoin blockchain's concensus rules, this protects it and this protection is precisely why it has such high value.
Removing those miners from the equation removes bitcoin's fundamental security that has been evolving over the last 8 years places would place it in the hands of massive unknowns,  E.g. Google cloud instances spun up in a sybil attack, botnets become feasible again, remember Steam mining???
Those miners are incentivsed to see bitcoin's value continue to rise, they are simply trying to maximise profits by taking as much from the tx fee as possible with full blocks (inevitable on any blockchain based system) while still allowing the economy to appreciate in value over time.  This is the supply/demand economics 101 stuff, they are not being greedy merely taking the money offered to them by those using the network, just seems many people don't agree with this inevitable outcome of on chain txs.
This is precisely how evolution works and I see it as a healthy competition. Should another alt coin does it better people will swap to that but right now that is not the case and remember SegWit is a hack on bitcoin because we can't rewrite it (see the white paper, it's one of the first things highlighted), an alt coin could do it right from the outset.
I do think the miners are missing a trick not adopting Segwit but then again if they don't it shows there is room for some healthy competition and we're all early adopters on a new coin that does allow it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:45:15
Thanks for taking the time to write such a comprehensive reply.  I also like your employer/employee analogy.  
I think a hierarchical approach is dangerous and I certainly don't believe the users are the controllers of bitcoin even though that may well be a great feature to aspire to having.
I for one opt for evolution design and my point of view is rather simple.  If bitcoin is hindered because 1Mb blocks and fee prices are too high to be usable or miners refuse to allow for innovative new features like SegWit, fungibilty enhancements, LN support,  it shows exactly what the bitcoin experiment is designed to do.  What worked well, what doesn't, what are the weaknesses that need to be corrected in a BitcoinV2.
BitcoinV2 will not start from scratch, instead it will be bootstrapped by bitcoin.   I guess one question is do we use the existing balances or do we start from scratch?
People will sell their bitcoin in exchange for the new stronger currency they see has a better technical implementation... yes they'll be a lot of 'bitcoin v2's out there and many will fail with one eventually emerging the leader again but only through this sort of evolution will cryptocurrency be able to adapt in a clean way without dragging a lot of legacy crap.
What I fundamentally disagree with is people using mob mentality to intentionally circumvent the precise security measure bitcoin represents and think this is sensible.
The miners do run the bitcoin network and are not the employees from my perspective.  Attempting to removing them from the equation is no different to me saying I'm going to make my own bitcoin and double the reward rate for anyone who adopts it... this is unlikely to succeed and would always be a contentious thing to do causing a fork and worse still if it works invites others to do the same trick again in future!  
I.e. the system would be clearly broken and both would be replaced by something better.
I guess from that standpoint my main problem is people calling a UASF bitcoin because it's not.  It is an alt coin and needs to stand on its own merit.  
For a UASF to stand a better chance of success I think they'd do better calling it the 'tcp_currency" and see if it sinks or swims.  Equally let bitcoin sink or swim on it's own without reddit manipulation.
You know what, I'm convinced.... let's do a UASF and see what happens... it's an experiment after all but my hunch is it will be brutal and set bitcoin back many years.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:47:06
That means they are fighting against 67% and will lose.
To put it another way, the main chain will produce 2 blocks for every 1 block BU makes until the next halving.  It will therefore mean they'd need to sustain their attack for (2 weeks / 33%) = 6 weeks before an adjustment was made whereby the fork could retarget 10min block times and compete with the main chain.
This means they are gambling a minimum of 6 weeks of earnings = ( 6 weeks x 7 days ) x 24 hours x 6 blocks per hour = 6048 x 12.5BTC = 75,600BTC
Their potential earnings if they remained on the strongest chain would therefore be
75,600BTC x 33% = $90,000,000 x 33% = $30,000,000 in lost revenue from mining rewards alone (also ignoring the likely hood it will reduce btc exchange price)
It also means that one mining cartel now controls 100% of the coin so is incredibly risky for anyone to use.
I.e. if they don't succeed you can almost expect they'll be out of business quickly unless they somehow get some exchanges to sucker up to support it and drag out the inevitable death of the minor chain.

This article is bullshit, this is not a problem for bitcoin and already works.  Also forks are import in decentralised architecture to achieve concensus otherwise how can you eradicate malicious errors.
Also I fully agree they've just described nothing new other than a PoS implementation from what is described there.  This is just wasting time. If he has done something new, make an alt coin and let's see it in action, don't screw with a live system that is working.

I'm afraid you're misguided thinking a contentious uasf is even a remote possibility of working these days.  It ignores precisely why bitcoin has value, because no one controls it, especially with mob mentality.
I'm for one am not trusting my coins to a different group of people fighting for their own agenda and certain others will share this view.  The  miners are adhering and enforcing bitcoin rules, that's sort of their purpose and they earn money from that.
Only way a pow change would happen is if miners stopped mining because it was compromised or a more profitable system appeared they swap to.
As for segwit, it's a great step forward for bitcoin but if the miners say no, get people to buy into an alt that does support it.  If segwit is needed by the miners it will get supported. (Yes I agree it would be excellent if they did but I'm happy to swap chains when something better than bitcoin appears)
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:00:39

There is certainly a BTC-&gt;USD conversion for the premium currently since USD is vastly larger currency than BTC.
That said there is a premium for these coins since they are becoming ever rarer.  
So whilst the premium is calculated in USD currently, this premium will continue rising much like any classic car does.
Equally I'd be surprised if that premium ever dropped below 120% of the coin's BTC value since they are rare collectors items nowadays.

Apologies if I've misunderstood your question but sounds like you're just needing to run bitcoind or bitcoinjs on a server and using that to do the transactions?  If you want to take the easier route just use blockchain.info's free API that handles all this for you.
I'd just set up a node.js or php script that receives the parameters in a REST call or something as simple as 
1) getaddresstopayto.php?person1=[address1]&amp;person2=[address2]&amp;etc...
This returns something like
Now on the server just detect when a payment is received to this address and is confirmed X times.  Next pay to the outputs requested in the API call above.
Now put some fancy UI around it, add some major security around it all, refine and open source :)

So all mining is doing is taking a set of transactions people have/are doing, plus a single funding transaction of 12.5 btc to your own address, plus the hash of the previous most recent block you are building on, plus a random number called a nonce.
It takes that chunk of data and hashes it via a simple process.  SHA256 hash twice.
If the produced value is higher than the current threshold, you increase the nonce (and optionally add new transactions you hear on the network).
Eventually when you find a combination of all that data that produces a hash value less than the threshold set by the bitcoin network your block is considered valid and will propagate around the bitcoin network as a shared truth and miners start working on the next block.
So by using more machines, you're basically just trying more random nonce values on the same block of data.
A home computer can probably do a few thousand hashes per second.  A GPU can do a few hundred thousand/million.
A dedicated bitcoin mining chip i.e. an ASIC (what is typically used these days) will do around 1,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.  Or put another way 1 ASIC chip is equivalent to 1,000,000  computers with fast GPUs.
Basically mining without an ASIC is not viable.   That said, it only takes one lucky hash and you've printed 12.5BTC and in theory a C64 could produce the winning hash, it's just rather incredibly unlikely given the network is currently running at around 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second at the moment.
Or put another way, the bitcoin network is using 100,000,000,000,000 high end GPU computers, so if you add say 25 high end computers to the mix, it will take on average
(( 365 days \* 6 blocks per hour \* 24 hours) / 100,000,000,000,000 ) / 25 =  \~once every \~114,155,251 years.

If you are doing it for a lively hood, making significant number of trades it will be treated as income tax but usually it's just CGT.  
If however you purchase/sell bitcoin intermittently a relatively small number of times through the year it's simply an asset and can be calculated as CGT.
I'm not sure what the clear demarkation is between IT/CGT threshold but I'd guess if you're doing 100 buy/sell trades a day you're squarely in the trading game.  Guess it's a case of just don't take the piss.

Your wallet has picked a chain it follows (vast majority will be the chain that has the most proof of work done on it).
If you use a SPV wallet like electrum/mycelium/bread  that will be using the core chain.
If you run a BU node you will be working on that chain.  
If you send a TX from either wallet it will 99.9% of the time be picked up by both chains and processed normally anyhow.  Only when you deal is a tx that is on one chain or the other does any discrepancy come in.
So to answer your question... your wallet will behave like normal.  If some exchange decides to make and support a BU chain you just pull your BU coins out, buy btc coins and make free money at the exchanges stupidity.
This fork is just misdirection (or proposed by ignorant people which I doubt).  It simply can not survive more than a few weeks from an economics point of view since it would be financial suicide for any company supporting it.

Decentralised digital currencies are unchartered  territory and there are a few major unknowns we need to figure out (eg fee market/scalability) 
I want to know if bitcoins future is settlement or digital cash sooner rather than later.  Until the block limit (artificially set or constrained by hardware) is hit we can't know.
My hunch is bitcoin will be a solid foundation settlement layer with LN, tree chain, sidechains or something else entirely offering the scalable digital cash route.  guess we will soon find out.
@_date: 2019-11-21 09:44:17
Perhaps but keep in mind solving the decentralised double spend problem was considered impossible in computing before bitcoin so never say never :)
Im not suggesting all of those will be solved, you’re right in that some of those may be unsolvable but because there is a demand and solutions to most exist but have their own drawbacks that have prevented adoption.
For example Lightning is one such new payment system, it stands on the foundations of bitcoin and can ony exist because of bitcoin. We have to temporarily swap bitcoin for LN credits.
Just happens that process is 1-1 and cryptographically certain it is safe in that you can guarantee to swap those ln credits back to actual onchain bitcoin easily.
If Lightning gains adoption it solves the privacy, instant confirmation and scalability issues but does introduce its own new issues like channel exhaustion, tied up funds, needing to be online to receive funds and pathing difficulties.  Time will tell if the advantages vs disadvantages make it the payment system of choice in time.  If it isnt we can be certain they’ll be other advancements put forward too.

If you think invest today and withdraw with more local currency next month you'd be simply playing poker.  You know the statistics and may come out ahead, you may be unfortunate and lose value, no one knows for short term basis and people claiming otherwise are fraudsters.
You can either buy bitcoin and hold if you think it's going up or you can short bitcoin on the exchanges if you think it'll go down... guess right and your value goes up but don't kid yourself, it is still just guessing in the short term unless you have very deep pockets!
In the long term you can make a more educated guess without fear of random volatility fluctuations.  Will bitcoin become more valuable in time or not?  If you do your own research and believe it will be, investing now seems sensible.  If you think there is a fundamental flaw or better technology that will usurp it shorting bitcoin makes more sense.
If nothing else it's a great rollercoaster ride so if you have spare cash to play with and could afford to lose in the worse case scenario it's a fascinating new area to discover.

You're right about the convenience of the mobile.  The ~10min confirmation time is mainly an issue for eliminating any chargeback risk so only an issue for "in person" sales or instant digital downloads.  If the store detects the RBF flag isn't set (i.e. a regular transaction) you can be pretty confident the transaction is not going to be double spent... certainly vastly more confident than a credit card having the same chargeback issue but over a 6 month period! 
Layers on top will eventually eliminate this as I don't expect to see direct raw bitcoin transactions being used by the public IMHO.  It's a bit like grabbing a web page in the early days with a CURL command... yes it's still technically possible but I doubt anyone except developers would do that these days, most just use a lovely presented browser that abstracts from the complexities.

Most people will need to wait until they see a use for it in their daily lives before the valuation makes sense. At the moment the most common reason i hear is ransomware but in time more products and services will also only accept bitcoin as payment and this had me convinced.
If you're considering investing in bitcoin speculatively you probably want to make your own mind up to be 100% certain rather than someone convincing you. Just it becomes too easy getting caught up losing money by playing an exciting forex market or selling at a low from fear when the value plummets briefly over a few days due to whales or fearmongering only to rebound just as quickly.
Not sure if it helps and best of luck whatever you decide.

You can calculate them by taking your hash rate (y) the hash rate of the network (h) and multiply by 24 hours * 6 blocks per hour 
i.e. 24 * 6 * y / h
So for your 1MH you'll have 
24 * 6 * 1Mhash / ( 1425093000000Mhash )
= 1/100000000% chance of finding a block in 1 day.

If say $1m from seized assets didn't go into that fund to pay them that $1m would come directly from more taxes.

If anyone thinks brexit has anything to do with bitcoin price, they may like to think this through.
Bitcoin is vastly more volatile than USD/GBP price and would be with or without an exit.  Whilst it's getting there, right now bitcoin is too small to be considered a global safe haven except in extreme scenarios.
The price drop is simply because the Aussies dumped something like $10m worth of coins within a day hence extra supply means reduced price... not rocket science.  The fact this happened shows just how much the market can move with only a few million so those worrying about brexit effecting their stored value wouldn't be putting huge sums in bitcoin at this stage.
That drop will have also scared a few of the newbies who've bought on the recent rally and the bots will be eating them alive while it reaches equilibrium.  (Seems most newbies have to learn the hard way that trading bots exist and are bloody good).
Who knows what will happen next but the stable price before was $350/btc, after the halving it the supply/demand equilibrium should be $700/btc if all else remained the same.
The fact there has been a few big advancements with bitcoin this week makes that original $700/btc seem undervalued again but time will tell and fascinating to watch.

It took me a while before I realised that most people's response about monetary policy wasn't apathy towards it, it's actually they simply don't believe it and think you're making up a conspiracy theory.
A close friend, a qualified accountant working at a major bank in a senior position, she doesn't even believe it is how it works.  This made me question if my understanding was right because she should know... did my own research only to find it is indeed how the system works.  (Only a simple wikipedia article read is required for quick confirmation for the lazy) 
Basically the entire process, including those involved in it, generally works because people have no idea how it works.
For those who do know it's a massive advantage financially and bizarrely no good comes from explaining to others how fractional banking works since it actually creates a lot of liquidity in society.  
I.e. fractional reserve banking is actually a good thing for society, the only dangerous issue is when banks pay themselves 'profits' out of the created money which risks draining reserves when a contraction happens.

I respectfully disagree.  Bitcoin's USP is about sending tangible actual value in an online environment without a private company being needed to facilitate and profit from it.  It offers a common global unit of value since it can be traded almost instantly around the world. That is the disruptive concept here, nothing to do with authorities or personification of bitcoin's purpose to exist.

There are two answers here... one which is probably what you want to hear, the second will sound crazy until you've been here for a while(and probably is still crazy).
1) The price is simply the cheapest price you can offer someone to buy bitcoin in your local currency.  Typically volume is greatest in USD based on exchanges like BitStamp, Kraken or Gemini hence people will tend to refer to this as the "exchange price" if they don't know themselves.  If there was a discrepancy between the price between exchanges people can make money in arbitrage sending money from one exchange to another.  The fact is it's a free floating market like all foreign exchange markets, there is no set exchange price by any official body but many amalgamate the exchange prices.  To follow the price there's no shortage of good websites to show it. E.g.
2)  Whilst it's too early to do this yet with a straight face, you may arrive at the same conclusion many have that bitcoin is actually the best unit to measure the value of all other currencies rather than the other way around.  The reasons being are...
*  Anyone can transfer bitcoin instantly to anyone around the world. This is a vast order of magnitude faster than any fiat trading which involves the banks and at settlement point physically moving items.
* Given the bitcoin resource is finite and purely digital, the innovation is that it can't be confiscated, faked, controlled or copied making it the worlds first digital asset agnostic of any country.  I.e. becomes a unit of value in itself.
* Fiat currencies are not a finite resource by definition so isn't easy to place a specific value on their worth which is why commodities and stock exchange markets are used.
* If country X banned bitcoin, it would still hold it's value because bitcoin can be sold globally for money and forex to exchange back locally.  No sensible country would shoot themselves in the foot in not being able to transact digitally in an emerging market where late comers will be seriously hindered.
That's why you can no longer pick up a bitcoin at $0.01 each but have to spend over $700.  Many still considered it vastly undervalued in the long run because finally having an open protocol to send tangible value over something virtual like the internet is an extraordinary step forward in technology. 
As for the unit of measure, satoshis are the smallest unit of bitcoin.

"I'd like to agree with you but then we'd both be wrong"
Selling off the assets doesn't go into another persons pocket,  that would be wrong and I agree that would be just as bad or worse than the criminal who actually worked for those funds.  That said though, the funds held by the now proven criminal are merely converted back to local currency to now pay for services and salaries that taxes of EVERYONE normally pay for, in theory people's tax bill should reduce a fraction(but probably doesn't as everywhere seems to run a deficit and not just a steady debt but that's another story).  
This means that stored wealth is now shared out across a vast number of people so the hoarded value of one person from illicit means is redistributed to all members of the public.  
If you think the authoritarian services are corrupt you probably have never worked in these places... 99% of people doing those jobs don't do it for the money but do it to feel good about helping others.  The 1% that are screwing a system over for money will have their wealth redistributed when discovered via this same process... I see it as mob mentality but done in a civilised way.

TLDR; She is certainly intelligent and well educated but she appears to be showing her lack of knowledge in cryptocurrencies by repeating rubbish that keeps being explained as not relevant.
"Many of those transactions that take place are illegal".  Source?    Here's a source that says the complete opposite.
From UK HM Treasury  *National Risk Assessment* document...
 *"There is little evidence to indicate that the use of digital currencies has been adopted by criminals involved in terrorist financing, whether as a means by which to raise funds (crowd funding etc.), to pay for infrastructure (e.g. server rental), or to transfer funds."*  [ 
And there is good reason Bitcoin is not used for those sorts of things, Bitcoin is fully traceable at the exchange points and bitcoin history is public and preserved forever... only idiots would use it for illicit purposes against a state that has the ability to acquire IP addresses/exchange details of those involved in a trade and ability to work back through the chain to identify anyone.
It is far easier to use commodities, offshore accounts or service industry to hide a transactions history.
"Its slow"
Urm, no, it's instant.  And confirmed settlement takes \~10 minutes.  That's like 2100x faster than the best banking system around and more robust.
"It's expensive"
Yes, but no where near as expensive as a SWIFT/BACS transfer.  It is also vastly faster and not held by a private company.  It is expensive because a lot of people are wanting to use it and it's still in very active development.  These costs will come down as it's insane to do interbank settlement on every single transaction around the world, this is what layer2 technologies are solving.
"Energy use".
Yes this is a temporary issue, this is also why bitcoin has to remain expensive to use and develop Layer2 technology and why the amount of electricity used halves every 4 years all things being equal.  Equally the internet, cars, electricity, heating, logistics, all use vast amounts of energy.  Perhaps we should solve the energy production issue rather than burning black sludge that is actually proven to be killing people.
Either she doesn't know this or she is perpetuating these myths because of fear it may impact the importance of a FED to control a nations supply.  Given the latter is not a significant threat to wealthy nations since people will still use their local currency and pay taxes in local currencies by law I can only think it's because she has been misled on the innovation and the advantages it brings rather than intentionally trying to spread FUD.  
This is actually a good thing, it show's she is sceptical and worried about non-important issues. It merely shows she is new to it, probably not actually used it and hasn't found any significant issue yet.  If someone wasn't sceptical of the bitcoin experiment at first they'd be a gullible person you should be cautious of.  
Her reservations show she is intelligent, done research by listening to the media and others so may take a while before the ah-ha moment as to why it is only going to continue getting stronger with or without her being a fan.

If you're wanting to get involved but unsure if this is a peak or a trough, buy a small amount each week regardless of the price.  Have a plan and stick to it.
This will ride out any volatility during the period you're purchasing but instead be tracking the overall longer term value of bitcoin where the trend has been pretty consistent.

TLDR; Being involved in the early days of a technology merely means you see it has vastly more potential ahead, not about the spot price.
If I may suggest something, try ignoring the actual price itself as it's more about % change.  I know it's hard because everyone focuses on the USD figure but honestly it's a massive red herring.
When bitcoins were being sold for $0.01 each it's because hardly anyone wanted them, hence that was the price they were worth and reflected the security of the system.  No one back from those days would have bought $10,000 worth at once just like right now no-one would buy $1Billion's worth in one go.
That said, let's consider one possibility of this experiment is that 1 bitcoin could equate to well over $100,000.  I've done posts on this is the past whereby btc captures a modest 5% of the gold market alone for instance.  Proclaiming bitcoin will reach this figure now is clearly insane as who knows the future but it is important to realise that it 'could' happen should storing value digitally becomes globally recognised (which IMHO appears to be slowly happening now).  
Guess what I'm saying is, if you believe bitcoin has reached it's peak and doesn't offer the world anything else than what it does right now it'd be crazy to invest in it just because you see others pushing the price up by buying some... that is a ponzi scheme and ends in tears.  Bubbles will happen and inevitably there will be a drop in value at some point soon but bitcoin will continue bouncing ever higher if history is anything to go by.  
If you believe the bitcoin protocol is still underutilised and perhaps see potential in things like DAOs, global value trade with a common base unit standard, digital contracts, digital ownership, legal document proof or other things digital currencies enable and is built using bitcoin... well $700 today will seem incredibly cheap in hindsight.  I mean $1 to $700 is 700x value increase.  Could 1 bitcoin become 700x more useful again with any of these inventions?  
Right now very few businesses use bitcoin as their value transfer mechanism, my hunch is this is going to change greatly over the next decade as it becomes more socially acceptable so for that reason alone I'm excited about its future.  
Bitcoin is far more secure and fit for purpose in an internet age and upgrading our legacy banking systems from archaic 1970's green screen terminals is simply not a viable competitor to this invention.  Banking is going to get disrupted by this internally or externally, whether it is bitcoin or something else, these old fashion privately controlled databases will inevitably be replaced by better technology that doesn't require trust with expensive regulations.  Right now bitcoin is a vast order of magnitude stronger than any other similar technology and the strongest and most secure chain will be the one I always follow.
Using that cliche line, only invest what you're willing to lose and who's to say the technology is out of its early days.

It's all about percentages, not absolute values.
An increase in $50 is only a 5% rise.  Still significant but when you think of it as you buy $100 of bitcoin and later sell it you'll have made a mere $5 profit (less fees)... the movement is not much at all.
Compare this to early 2015, a $50 increase at say $200 is a whopping 25% hence that same investment of $100 would have given a return of $25 or 5x as much.
I.e. it wouldn't be surprising to see a value change of $200 in a single day to match early 2015 changes but it does seem more measured at the moment.

Bitcoin far from makes banks obsolete, it merely changes their purpose to exist.  If they remain lazy and don't adapt and embrace the new inventions they will be out of business by those banks that do adapt.  Luckily most banks probably hire smart staff who will realise this instead of just sitting back waiting to become unemployed (except perhaps the old timers who want that big redundancy cheque).
We still need national currencies, simplicity, loans, insurance, escrow, etc... all of these things are open for banks to offer to retain customers.  What has changed is soon we no longer require banks for these services now the centralised trust problem has been solved with bitcoin.
  
People will still opt to use a bank if it's more convenient and familiar so the banks merely need to make sure they remain relevant.  Luckily, bitcoin as it is right now is far too difficult for the general public to care about wanting to use it.  Only those who have curiosity, time or wealth on their hands will probably research it.
Will bitcoin be the enabler like the internet did for printed media OR will it be like the airplane invention?  I.e. a massive enabler but very few people can use it directly but will use a company that flys them... time will tell.  
One thing is certain though, banking is soon to have a vast shakeup because this "value transfer on the internet" can't be un-invented and whilst it may not end up in every persons pocket, it will rewrite how banking is done in an internet world.

It's quite a lot of preventative measures like you say, if QCs become powerful enough reversing your public key to the private key does become feasible.
HOWEVER that isn't the only reason.  A couple other reasons are...
1) Address reuse puts an element of trust on your wallet that it doesn't reuse or use a predictable R value when making the tx signature.  If it were to reuse the R value your private key can (and will) be trivally derived by the bots scanning the network.  This has caught a number of people out.  I'm not aware of any wallets with this vulnerability anymore but never say never.
2) It makes it easier to link transactions to you.  Again no biggy usually but is something that may not be obvious so easier to just say don't do it.

"best" is a tricky thing because it's excellent at some things and dreadful at others.
It is the best in that you can be certain you are directly communicating with the blockchain and can independently verify the consensus of the network and validity of transactions.  
It is not the best when it comes to storing funds however.  HD hardware wallets like Trezor are probably the best for this.  
For other 'best's, this is my view on the common wallets out there.
Simplicity wise I'd say BreadWallet is my favourite.
MyCelium and Copay are better more advanced wallets.  (Co-pay because they allow for testnet wallets too which is brilliant for developers).
Blockchain.info is best for online wallet in that you own the bitcoin but is easily accessible from a browser.  It used to be best for purchasing bitcoin easily but this has now changed.
Coinbase is best for simplicity in buying small amounts of bitcoin easily I believe.

You want the bitcoin address to change.  Every time you receive a payment to an address the wallet should change it.
Your wallet's job is simply to keep track of all the passwords for each address it creates for you.  If you use something like electrum or mycelium it will generate the addresses in a deterministic way such that you just need to essentially remember the root key that all these addresses will be generated from (usually in the form of 13 words)
If it puts your mind to rest, your old addresses can still receive future funds on them perfectly, your wallet will detect this and your balance is made up by summing balances in ALL your addresses even if the wallet doesn't show you these old addresses.
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:40:10
Bitcoin isn't ready for this sort of mass usage yet.  The scalability enhancements/layers are needed before a push for retailers to consider using it is sensible.  These additional layers also need to solve usability issues like abstracting the bitcoin payment addresses, allowing receipts and other features consumers expect.

An interim step will be companies like Plutus.it who merge the new and old technologies together.

This dusting thing is odd.  So someone sends you a few satoshis to an address you've used before, it clearly costs more than the few satoshis to include that tx in any future payment you do so will just sit in that address for forever as it's basically unspendable by any sensible wallet.
What it used to be able to do is when fees were so low that dust would get swept up in future payments which I believe would help you follow funds through any mixing process but clearly this shouldn't work anymore... 
Another approach is these low tx's fill up the blocks with pointless txs and increase the UTXO set everyone has to carry.  Annoying but not going to break anything.
Finally they could be stress testing wallets in that some may be crap and sweep up tx's without checking if they are worth using.  The early bitcoin clients for instance did a pretty straight forward 'keep adding tx's until we have enough' approach and use random stochastic selection to find the best minima fee if the total inputs was &gt; payment wanting to be made.  In this approach dust transactions would have been picked up but I'm pretty sure this isn't the way it's done now (I will have to check the code though! [
Dust transactions do make sense in something like Monero where the coin selection is done purely randomly so gives some indication as to the relationship between addresses.  E.g. if you have two dust transactions that start at an address and in future recombine at an address you can be pretty confident the transaction chains of each dust transaction has been done by the same person so you can determine what where payments and what were change txs.
So guess I want to know why people do it in Bitcoin too because I don't think it's obvious :)

Your wallet just holds the passwords to spend the bitcoin that is stored on the global database (the bitcoin blockchain everyone goes on about).

Yes, by the nature of how blockchain offers trust to users it does mean they can't recover your funds.
Best bet is to try and recover your phone, is there any chance you can find it?  Every phone has an IMEI number in which can't be changed, i.e. if that phone is turned on the phone company knows exactly where it is... just need the police to help find it.
Find my iphone/android also offer a feature so owners can do it themselves but depends if you turned this feature off.
Finally you could send a txt message to the phone offering a reward to the thief to return it or help find it again.

Many people are mixing segwit debate and the Blocksize debate.
It's like asking 'should we allow busses on the roads because it carries more people OR should we build an electric car'.  The thing is the two aren't related, just so happens both might be more environmentally friendly so are compared. 
Ie we can do none, either or both... They're both independent features.  
Segwit is more about fixing malleability issues and allowing new script commands gracefully IMHO.
The fact a segwit transaction can save some space is merely a bonus extra.
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:38:05
There are managed wallets (like Coinbase) or SPV wallets (like Bread/MyCelium/Copay) or full clients like bitcoind. 
Managed wallets mean the company themselves own the bitcoin and just promise to send those bitcoins out to the destinations you request.  
Managed wallets have a risk that if that central company (e.g. Coinbase) gets compromised or disappears your bitcoin could vanish.  This is what happened to MtGox, Bitfinex to name a few.    Managed companies can also freeze your funds if they like.  E.g. if you receive funds from a source they find questionable they may freeze your account until you explain to them how you got the funds.
SPV wallets however transact directly on the global blockchain meaning you control the funds directly, no questions asked because it's you making the transactions directly.  They are however light weight in that they connect to trusted computers to broadcast your transaction (you can usually run your own connection too but I doubt anyone really does).  SPV's are usually the best option for most bitcoin users.  An HD (hierarchical deterministic) SPV wallet is best which I think all are now.  The HD wallet means that if you remember the 12 words it gives you, you can access your bitcoin from any device anywhere in the world just by remembering those words.
Full clients download the entire blockchain (about 100Gb) and are rather heavy weight.  Most people only run a full client if they're doing development or want to not trust anyone at all.
I.e. managed wallets are simply IOUs rather than you actually owning the bitcoin.  SPV wallets are therefore far safer in that your transactions can't be blocked and your funds can't be stolen or disappear if the managed wallet company has an issue.

Bitcoin uses a blockchain.  
Think of this blockchain as a regular notebook. Each page in the notebook is a block.  You write down the transactions happening everywhere around the world in realtime by writing on this page in a book.
You can only change the page of the book when a miner comes along and stamps your page with an 'approved' stamp.  Before that stamp of approval you can merely try to cram in as much info on that single paper page but clearly there is a limited amount of space.
Right, so the blocksize is about making that page bigger.  Right now it's a tiny A4 page so could easily go larger.  The issue is at somepoint the page size will be so big it's unweildly and you won't be able to even turn the page it's so massive and the book becomes so large people wouldn't be able to keep a copy at home.  To handle the vast number of transactions the world does, each page probably needs to be the size of a football stadium.  So whilst we can increase the paper size now, at some point it's just a daft idea to.
Introduce lightning network.
This is a bit like people chatting to each other before they write in the book.  They say 'hey I've got Alice wanting to spend $5 to Bob here." and someone else saying "I've got Bob wanting to send Carol $5"  and another saying "Carol wants to send Alice $2".  Now we could record all 3 transactions or we could just write "Alice sent Carol $3".  1 transaction needed and the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol are now still correct.
There is some clever jiggery pokery to make sure people can't fake these messages but in essence LN is about taking transactions out of the blockchain and handling them directly through chains of people and only using the blockchain to record the settlement at an appropriate time.
This means for alice, bob and carol would all have to opt to use the LN system so is a layer built on top of Bitcoin.
It is one way to vastly scale bitcoin to handle the worlds transactions.
The reason people don't want to increase the blocksize now is two fold... Firstly to force LN and other vastly scalable solutions to be considered and created, and secondly to finally create a fee market whereby a transaction fee has a market rate rather than merely an antispam value.  
This is important because this fee market can only exist when the asset becomes valuable in itself.  Bitcoin is currently the ONLY digital currency capable of doing this so far and is an important variable in the experiment to understand sooner rather than later.
In a nut shell, my take is that both parties want bitcoin to succeed.  
* The Smaller blocks approach want bitcoin to be more successful faster by addressing scalability solutions immediately.
* The Larger blocks think it's rushing the scalability layers and nervous the arbitrary limitation that can be easily changed will make an alt currency appear more attractive.
I was in the larger camp, I'm now in the smaller camp in case my opinion sounds biased.

Segwit doesn't extend Blocksize afaik, if it does please share the github link where the variable has changed because I didn't see that.  
What segwit does is do is offer a new transaction type, if used can store additional data external to the blockchain than can be ignored by old miners and easily culled later so not bloating the blockchain for years to come.  Most wallets probably would embrace and use this new tx type which would therefore allow more txs per block.
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:45:28
You still have to pay a fee between nodes, that fee is usually insignificant but if you're spamming your route I expect it will add up. 
Perhaps a mitigation would be for nodes to allow them to up their fee based on the frequency of requests, it's probably pretty easy to identify intentional spam.
Remember it would only effect your route, it doesn't effect the rest of the LN so I'm not sure what such an attack would be helpful for other than potentially annoying random people to get yourself banned.
I guess it's the equivalent of you attempting to DDOS your friend on facebook with messages, probably won't work, probably get banned and probably get in trouble if you keep doing it whilst it won't effect the rest of the network.

My thought process is people can purchase new coins using bitcoin in whatever new crypto they feel is going to be more useful. 
Ie imagine bitcoin PLUS unlimited tx/s, simple to use, direct p2p with instant sync time, instant confirmation, 100% fungible, fully private if wanted, easier multisig, no mining needed, 0 mining fees charged... if that existed you could see people may start using and buying this new coin with ₿ seems an essy upgrade. It also means anyone supporting another chain needs to put their money where there mouth is so becomes a slow migration with survival of the fittest.
Currently nothing usurps bitcoin but something may...

It seems a fairly well considered approach although somewhat biased but I realise they need to focus on just the nefarious criminal acts where bitcoin (or more likely monero) could be involved.
"Tier 4 – Frontline officers and investigators – All UK police staff should be required to complete a mandatory Bitcoin e-learning package 
 (NCLAT), on how to identify bitcoin activity and who to contact for further advice. "
This bit seems most sensible, allow officers to fully understand how it works, why it was invented and how it's used to express value and that the system itself is legitimate.  The fact that criminals do illegal things is separate to whatever payment system they adopt, if cryptocurrencies didn't exist they'd simply use another (and to be fair only an uneducated criminal would use opt to use bitcoin given it's trace-ability).
Having a conversation just yesterday with a security expert who thought it should be banned shows just how far we still have to go in educating people in that this is a new invention and here to stay... outlawing doesn't prevent those crimes from happening but would prevent all the legitimate innovations and advantages it offers from happening in that country (e.g. instant global payments, not requiring fees from banks, computers can make transfers, vastly faster that usual payment systems, no chargebacks, escrow, cosigned payments, contracts, designed to be secure for the internet, etc... )
There is still too much focusing on "payment as a crime" which is daft, the crime is the ransomware/extortion/selling illegal goods... not the payment system and this needs to be realised since it's only in the last generation this concept has been mixed up and we have been driving on a dangerous course of blurring this clear distinction.

Did you create your wallet pre 0.13.0?  If so, yes you must backup regularly.
0.13.0+,  you need to check it's using an HD wallet.  On a brief look it appears to be the case but I'll let someone else chime in to confirm this because I've not looked or know an easy way to detect if your wallet is an HD one.

You should definitely set those parameters if you're using RPC.  Look for the bitcoin_conf file and add the lines in if they're not already there.  I expect the default behaviour is to lock down RPC and only enable it if these are set since it's such a huge security risk otherwise.

Coinbase currently have your funds mixed up with everyone elses they have access to so you can't get 'your' keys as such.  Instead you need to withdraw the funds to your own wallet.
I'd recommend BreadWallet/MyCelium/Copay/Electrum wallet (in ascending order of advanced features, all are excellent) depending on which device you use.
Now transfer your coinbase funds to your new wallet where you now control the keys directly.
If you're paranoid about the funds being compromised, simply write down the 12 word phrase the wallet gives you with pen and paper a couple times and delete the wallet!  
As scary as it sounds, your funds are still there since they are actually stored on the actual bitcoin blockchain.  A wallet merely handles the passwords to spend those funds at the addresses and that12 word phrase generates all those passwords for you.

It certainly can be changed with a fork (hard or soft) but it would require the network to agree to the change.  It's non-trivial to do and would cause even more bloat on the blockchain given smaller transactions can be expressed so I'd expect they'd have to be a very good reason for doing it.  
You are right though, any change is possible if it becomes critical to allowing bitcoin to continue to succeed.

Joking aside, I have no qualm with these people pushing their own event, good on them and good luck to the event as they have a good niche (although it should be yay bitcoin, boo blockchain, but whatever).

In all seriousness I've been to a few of these in Europe and they were actually very good.  Damn shame the human  psychology mean this sort of marketing is needed rather than they just gain traction on decent reputation of putting forward good content with good networking.  My main issue with it was it was darn expensive... like elitest expensive.  Would rather they offered a test for those who know what they're talking about to get a discount since they actually bring value to these events and are the people I want to meet.

Every 4 years it will double in value... probably.
If there is massive adoption due to LN or other layer2 technology it will rise faster.
If there is a compromise of a big exchange or outlawed somewhere it will reduce in value.
If a solution to ECDSA public key-&gt;private key appears the value will probably drop close to 0 as people migrate to another hardened cryptocoin (also every bank and website would be compromised so v unlikely to happen in our lifetime).
 
This is only a guide however, the whole experiment is uncharted territory so no one actually knows other than making educated guesses based on the fixed parameters we can be certain of such as supply rate halving.

You sell your car to someone, you get $9000 of value (10 ₿), you go to an exchange and they say. 'That money came from wikileaks donations, we aren't touching it, actually we are closing your account because it might be dodgy'
Hmm, great so now you go elsewhere and probably higher fees or need to wait days to setup the accounts.
You take your money you earned from a legitimate trade, clear any history so it's fungible like money should always be and go back to that same exchange and it works.  
Bitcoin carries it's clear history when used without mixers. This oppressive practice of checking funds history is forcing all transactions to eventually be fully opaque by default.  
I too was against mixers until this epiphany that like it or not, it's an inevitable evolutionary step for digital currencies and the good money being totally fungible will always push out the bad money that lacks this capability.

My point is that it's impartial rather than BBC's last article which was heavily biased in dismissing bitcoin, not to mention bringing up SR, MtGox and every other negative point they could.
"one block of bitcoins is processed."  Yeah, ok that is pretty dreadful and could have been worded much better to explain it... say "For each problem solved, a new block is generated which consists of a link to the last block and all the verified recent bitcoin transactions since that last block" or something.
The 15/16 million, yep again it's only a million out, rounding error? :)
12.5 aren't added every 10 minutes, it is an average so yes the way they've phrased it is incorrect/ambiguous at best but I don't think it's really that important to readers to understand how the intricacies work... always makes me cringe when mainstream media try to explain it, wish they'd just skip over that part.

There are three reasons to buy bitcoin
* Because you think you can sell it again in future for more local money.
* Because you want to back a digital payment system that isn't owned by a private profit making company
* Because you need it to buy/sell something you want.
Most of the money that floods in on the spikes is people in camp  which is why it always drops after a peak.  As we approach the next halving it's very likely a spike will happen again as people realise it becomes a safer store of value than local currency in a bank.
Camp  generally sustains the longer term price buying dips.
Camp  are the ones making bitcoin become ever more valuable.
We are in holding pattern at the moment in that Lighting needs time to mature to grow

$100k per bitcoin gives a market cap of $2.1 trillion.
If we are generous and say 1/2 the coins are untouchable that's around $1 trillion of value being contained in bitcoin.
Is this feasible?  Well the M0 of USD alone is around $5 trillion... if bitcoin is used to transfer at purely the cash level (i.e. no debt) and had a 10% of the global market share and not just US, yes $1 trillion valuation is possible.
**IF** it gets to that stage however it wouldn't stop there, the M1/M2 valuation would need to be used inflating the valuation further since bitcoin would become a settlement asset between countries so we're talking it's upper limit is vastly beyond $1 trillion now.
Will it happen in our lifetime?  Incredibly unlikely but unless something even better than bitcoin comes along it's almost inevitable bitcoin will continue gradually becoming more and more valuable and being more recognised as the common denomination of value around the world.
**For the naysayers, they'd do well considering those people who would never believe 1 bitcoin be worth more than $1 and think $100 per bitcoin is laughable **
Whilst we're only at 500x more valuable than that $1 USD bill it continues to gain momentum.  These laughable numbers may not be so funny if you think the other way and consider "what could stop people from perceiving it having value?".  So many attempts to discredit it have already been tried and the brand is tainted with nefarious uses in the public's mind yet somehow it's still thriving... now more and more legitimate uses are coming forward because of cost savings, efficiency and security, that perception will inevitably change so what will stop it next?

Fair comments to a degree although his conclusion is wrong IMHO.
The centralisation is an issue, as is the scalability but I think both are being addressed.
If LN works as planned the scalability is 'solved' and can easily surpass MC/Visa rates.  Transaction rates however aren't a criteria to continual appreciation.
If Chinese miners started changing the rules people could simply invoke a bitcoin hardfork whereby the mining algorithm is swapped out to another one thereby resetting their advantage.  Yes it would be a minority hardfork and probably a painful transition but certainly do-able if someone was clearly gaming the mining system for a national advantage.

The 1mb block decentralised pov is merely reflecting what another has posted so true or not it is one reason some people prefer small blocks at this stage.
I too think the system can easily cope with larger blocks but I'm also keen on having the impetus in trying to find a scalable solution now before its imperative we find one.
For example, if a 2008 event happens again bitcoin in its current state can not achieve its goal because adoption will be vast in a short time.  I'm not fussed about a mere 2x adoption, I'd like to see a system to be able to easily cope with 100x adoption within a year and that won't happen if we think increasing the block size is a solution.

Solve the remaining problems before they are solved in Bitcoin.  Namely
• Instant confirmations (already coming in Lightning Network)
• Vast scalability (already coming with Lightning Network)
• Simplify on/off ramps globally. 
• Make it fungible (segwit should allow for zkSnarks to solve this. At the moment this is the next major hurdle to IMHO)
• Easy to pay people without needing qr codes. As easy as NFC with biometric confirmation.
• Theft protection built in
• More decentralised

I know, I don't get it either.  All I know is I got real BTC from someone somehow for their leap of faith coin.  I'm still wrestling with who would have taken the other side because surely no one would value a brand new weaker chain at the same valuation as the original stronger one?  
I could understand doing   BCH valuation = ( BCH hash rate / BTC hash rate ) * BTC value in USD as the upper bound for BCH/$
I think that works out at a top price of around $250 at the time but clearly I've overlooked something because it's still trading well above that or there's yet more dumping to be had.
edit:20170807, just going to point out... the only upside I can see is if a miner orchestrating BCH dump had enough BTC on standby to temporarily collapse the price of BTC whilst also swapping hash rate over to BCH to make it the primary coin.  
This would effectively be like getting people to sell their bitcoin for less money since BCH would eventually become known as the 'bitcoin'.  It would also mean other miners would probably be forced to join BCH since it will temporarily be unprofitable to mine BTC.
I'd normally say this is not feasible since it would cost tens of millions of dollars to attempt with massive risk on it actually not working but it is crazy times we live in...

No.  A 'bitcoin' is a rather arbitrary number representing 100,000,000 satoshi units.  All transactions are done in satoshis in bitcoin and these are integer values to make sure there are never any rounding problems.
That said, the layer 2 protocols built on top of bitcoin can support sub-satoshis.  Lightning network for instance can represent fractions of satoshis, only when settlement on the bitcoin blockchain is the value rounded to the nearest satoshi.

Apple could just start accepting it, if mc or visa complained, Apple could simply speak to the other saying let's do an exclusive deal for X years and we promise to drop your competitor off a cliff.  
Now what do they do? That dropped party launch an iPhone competitor?  They're dead in the water as their 1950s tech is so unbelievably 'not fit for purpose' in an Internet age and just lost a platform many of their customers use.
 Apple/Google pay is their main light at the end of a tunnel to keep them relevant and secure... 
That eventual outcome means mc/visa know this so wouldn't dare annoy Apple/Google over something a trivial as bitcoin support.
The amusing thing is people seem to think this is unlikely until you remind them that Apple recreated googlemaps and removed their app in the past, ie they are ruthless when needed and do the like being dependent on other companies.

Not many people have it yet, sites accepting bitcoin will only become better known as the on/off ramps become easier and LN exists.
Do you highlight the advantages to the user of paying it bitcoin?  E.g. it's far safer, privacy is vastly better, discount since no fraud and no chargebacks.
Also do you offer any links for people to buy bitcoin or install wallets on their phones?
Right now the ecosystem is disjointed, realistically wallets should offer the fiat-&gt;crypto-&gt;fiat facility but the banks make this difficult.  Someone needs to solve this now LN is on the horizon.

I don't think this is correct but happy to be proved wrong.  The Blocksize does not change with segwit, just additional external data is now possible and if wallets use this feature more txs per block can be used. the actual blockchain block is still capped at the same value so old miners can ignore the extra data feature if they choose to keep to 1mb.

Whilst I share your sentiment I think the write up is there to encourage new users, not scaremongering at all so they must have encountered issues.
The fact you have 1/4 left to sync is not meaning you only have 25% left to go I'm afraid.  There are checkpoints in there after which point it verifies each transaction so it gets incredibly slow after reaching one of those checkpoints... again, not scaremongering but even on my high end PC it took several days to get those last few months synced.   I also encountered crashes on a PC, namely when running out of disk space it just died without gracefully warning there was say only 1Gb of disk space left.
It also died when I had a power cut, corrupted the blockchain and had to resync everything.  I also found out the hardway that killing the process rather than shutting it down does the same as a powercut, luckily that was just on testnet.

How much could you afford to lose?
If you say I'm willing to spend $20 on learning how this works just buy that.  It's incredibly unlikely it will go to 0 overnight, with all the turmoil and tribulations it's already gone through show how robust it is so far.
If it's a case of 'I want to have a little risk' you could say I can afford for ₿ price to drop by 50% before I'd sell so you could buy $40 worth now with that plan.  If the price drops by half you can exit and frame it in your mind as 'I paid a $20 fee to own and experience  using bitcoin.'
Generally the saying is bitcoin could go to 0 or could go vastly higher than where it is, no one knows for sure. It is an experiment after all. Past history isn't something to budget on, just consider if bitcoin has reached its full potential would be my advice.
With segwit about to be activated (a feature we've been waiting for for over a year now), lightning network now around for the corner, Japan recently legalising it for payments, governments still using private corporate networks for value transfers and bitcoin supply rate to halve in 3 years making it have less inflation than most countries at this point... I would like to believe there is more ahead but will let you decide.

The reference client is full of features most won't need if they just plan on transferring coins.
Firstly it requires 100gb of space.  (You can prune it however but still takes DAYS to sync before you can use it)
~~The biggest issue IMHO is it's not an HD wallet. From a usability point of view this makes it much harder than mobile SPV clients since you have to regularly back it up.  Those backups (and the process of obtaining them) is a security headache.~~  (Edit: As of 13.0 it is an HD wallet apparently, sorry I hadn't noticed this and awesome work by the bitcoin coders!)
Ie the ref client is now more for developers/miners or hard core bitcoin users.
To solve this we need to separate out the ref client into 2 distinct items.
* A bitcoin node
* A bitcoin HD wallet
With this it would be good to have a Web portal interface to interact with the bitcoin node (view stats, query the db, query txs/blocks, etc)
The wallet is just obsolete tech in the ref client.

Proof of work is something that takes a long time to find a solution but very quick to check.
An example is asking someone to write a sentence with all 26 letters of the alphabet used.
It may take them a few minutes to write this whereas it only takes a few seconds to verify it.
Bitcoin's PoW is much the same sort of quiz.  It uses an algorithm called SHA256 which essentially is you take a number 'x' , run it through this algorithm and get 'y' result... This is called a hash.
Now the result of SHA256 gives a 'vast' number.  For demo purposes though say it's a number between 0-100.  Now the bitcoin network says.  "If you find a 'y' that is less than some target difficulty number 'd' then you have found a solution".
So all you do is try x, then x+1, then x+2, x+3, x+4, etc....   until you find the solution  'y' &lt; 'd'.
If d = 5, this means it will take on average 100/5 = 20 guesses before you find a solution.  It may only take 1 guess, it may take 500 guesses but on average it will take 20 guesses.
The excellent thing is now everyone can check your work quickly because you tell them the answer is 'x' = 37 for instance.  They can run it through SHA256 and will find the result 'y' is say 2 which is less than 'd' which is say '5'.
Adjusting 'd' makes the problem easier or harder.
This is exactly what is happening in bitcoin however the formula is actually SHA256( SHA256( header + x ) )  and d is calculated based on how quickly the last 2016 blocks were found so it self adjusts to make sure a block should be found once every 10 minutes on average.

Welcome to ₿ world!
I wouldn't recommend right now, it's experienced vast gain over last two weeks.  If you do want to buy in yet a 50% drop sounds terrifying, buy a little each week over the year.  It is not a get rich quick thing and buying now in fear of missing out will likely be costly as others inevitably cashout at all time highs.
Buying when the media loses interest or something bad is announced is far more profitable IMHO but takes some preplanning to do (set up exchange, deposit funds, verification)

If you have $5 in your pocket, you should be able to safely swap that $5 with another random person knowing that when you go to a shop both notes are accepted equally as $5.  That's fungibility...
If however someone drew an amazing piece of micro art on the $5, it becomes worth say $100 so the $5/$5 swap is no longer true for the person holding the microart note.
With bitcoin, each transaction has an associated chain of transactions from where the balance of coins originated from right back to when they were all first mined.  Whilst those transactions are pseudoanonymous, some addresses are known (or are tainted intentionally by services sending small amounts of money to these services to trace their money). 
 
E.g. say a website that shares leaked documents accepts donations.  If you were to receive money that was previously given there, when you go to send your funds the new receiver may look at the history and say 'nope, not having those bitcoin because they've got a history associated with a website I don't want any association with'.  Even worse is, using those coins could cause your account to be closed at an exchange.  If this were to happen it breaks 1btc = 1btc rule.
This is why privacy of transactions is absolutely crucial to money to ensure fungibility to a currency's units of value, it's not just about financial privacy, it's making sure you know your stored value has the same equivalent purchasing power to another persons identical amount.
There are companies such as Elliptic that destroy fungibilty in bitcoin by offering this service (I'm not picking on them, if they didn't do it another group would have because it's not difficult).  
They offer their services to exchanges to protect funds coming from dubious sources however inadvertently shooting themselves in the foot because they are now driving us towards ALL transactions needing to become anonymous.  I was against coin shuffling originally but once I understood what these services were doing it, it became apparent privacy is an inevitable evolutionary step in digital money.
The reason it makes me frustrated is the pseudoanonymous approach is actually helpful for law enforcement.  In a court of law, a tx could be used as supporting evidence when a crime has been investigated.  Pseudoaonymous also means a person can't be investigated by merely making a transfer but instead, once a crime has been correctly investigated and the culprits found, any crypto txs on their computers become compelling evidence they were directly associated.  
This approach however will become unpractical due to these tx history services forcing us to move from pseduoanonymous to fully anonymous and guaranteed fungibility that cash and direct trades offer.

The problem is the number is just that on a piece of material.  It can be copied so has not provable backing value.
I.e. I create a multisig address "12345678" and print it on the note, now anyone can print more notes with "12345678".  Even if someone accepting one of these fradulent notes were to check, they'd see the balance does indeed exist on the blockchain but requires trusting two items.  
* 1. The issuer doesn't spend that money on the blockchain themselves (with collaborating with the multisig party)
* 2. The note itself isn't counterfeited.
If you can make a non-counterfeitable note, you're issuing a trust token that can be passed around.
This could work if say one private key holder of the multisignature address was say the United Nations / IMF or other independent party and the other is a nation HOWEVER you'd need more security on that note than just the address.
For instance you could do this such that the note has a simple NFC chip in which can sign a challenge message thereby proving the note itself has the private key without disclosing what it is.
I believe this is what the UK is about to do with the new £1 coin and I'd expect backed by just a private database the royal mint controls.  It's a step towards what you're proposing but not using the global digital commodity like bitcoin yet.  If this is indeed what they are doing, it will be fascinating to see how they put a chip in the metal coins and how they manage to program the chips and protect them from deterioration.

You could check your address is still containing the bitcoin.
That should be reassuring enough since you can only generate that address with the private key.
If you want to double check the private key you could import it via an offline computer and use something like "coinb.in" website that you can run offline/airgapped.
If your funds exceed a thousand dollars perhaps it's worth buying a Trezor or other hardware wallet, and send the funds there so you can check the balance safely anytime you like?

Yes, a hash is just a function where you put number 'x' in and get 'y' out.  If you put the same value in, you always get the same value out.
2016 = 14 days * 24 hours * (60 mins / 10 min intervals) 
You take the input to the hash 'header + x'  where 'header' can be thought of as a merging of all the numbers from the transactions in the proposed block the miner is making.  'x' is just a nonce value, i.e. literally a value you start at 0 and add 1, try again, add 1, try again, etc....
You must find an output of the hash where the number is less than the difficulty value as calculated by the history of the network.  If your calculated value produces a 'y' that is higher than this difficulty target it is an invalid solution so ignored by the community.  
This is why the entire network is currently calculating 2,849,310,768,000,000,000 hashes every single second just to try and find that illusive nonce value.
It's an absolutely insane amount of computing power!

"People are not using bitcoin to buy my gold they're buying it with dollars because BitPay convert it to dollars for me"
Well if I bought gold from him I would never be touching dollars, only bitcoin??  He may want to accept paying a fee to convert it to dollars if he wants, that's his choice but misses the point that for people outside of America they can easily buy his product now.
"What stops something better coming along?"
Absolutely nothing, in fact it's exactly what has happened.  We had gold, it was replaced by bank notes which was replaced by fiat which is now being replaced by Bitcoin.  Something even better than bitcoin may come along in the future, spinning up a clone however is not better because it's about network effect.
"You can buy/sell gold digitally".
He's missing the point, the problem they are trying to solve is how to prevent the double spend issue with this setup.  I.e. make sure your digital currency correlates 1 to 1 with gold in a vault.  Problem is that system he described suffers two major flaws.  Firstly it requires trust that the company running that digital currency will always honour gold withdrawals, history has shown time and time again this is not the case.  Secondly it involves trust that the company is not running a fractional reserve.  This can not be proven, it depends on trust.  
Again this is what bitcoin solves, mining gives a provable non-fractional reserve ledger of a finite resource, therefore why would I need the unnecessary physical object to prove this digital finite asset?  I don't, it's wasteful hence why Bitcoin exists and continues to gain momenteum.
I get it though, he loves gold, his business is in gold, gold does have useful properties in electronics but it's value is vastly overpriced for it's intrinsic properties so isn't a sensible argument.
Reason bitcoin exists is because it has solved the unnecessary 3rd party trust problem that gold solves on a geographically local area.  Sending gold around in a digital age is simply not sensible, hence why bitcoin (or something like it) was inevitable.  
Internet money was designed into the internet protocol way back in the 80's but abandoned because no one knew how to solve it at the time.  
What is remarkable is it took 30 years before someone discovered the solution to implement it...

They way 95% of these mining companies will work is...
1. Take people's money.
2. Buy btc.
3. Give back say 50-75% of that bitcoin to the user
4. Keep 50-25% of the bitcoin for yourself.  Do no mining.
5. Go bankrupt or end the contract after a year.
They're all fake and you'll earn more money by simply buying bitcoin.
If it did make money and you owned one, why on earth would you let others buy into your scheme to get free money?  If it worked you'd be far better off simply explaining it to a bank and they'd give you the money.
It's not difficult to setup your own mining system, you'll need to run it for over a year to just potentially breakeven (assuming BTC value remains the same or goes up as it has been).  The likelyhood your mining setup will be profitable after 2 years is pretty slim, usually you have to throw it in the bin unless btc price keeps rocketing at which point you'd still have made more money just buying btc in the first place and not have a fire risk in your home.

IMHO Power mining is not about textbook mining, i.e. converting to local currency and paying your bills plus keeping what's left over... that's hobby stuff that still goes on but not why China is doing vast warehouses.  
Power mining is about having a reasonable influence on the supply rate of a fixed rate commodity appearing on exchanges.  Any edge on this can increase profits considerably at the same time pushing btc price up steadily meaning win/win for everyone.
This control large mining pools have will diminish over time as the reward rate drops but right now I expect this is a significant factor and one of the reasons for spikes happening and why we will see the rates rise quickly in the next 4 years.
I.e. this is more akin to De Beers diamonds monopoly cartel practices which were very profitable by limiting supply available.
It's just a hunch because it's what I'd do.  Only way to know is to track how many of the coinbase txs are actually entering the ecosystem vs sitting stagnant.

It wasn't worth much years ago...
To say someone would have bought it 5 years ago and hold onto it now to make a fortune is fairly similar to someone saying if they had realised the next 10 runs of the roulette table were to come up red they'd have always bet on red.
The truth is people bought in 5 years ago will have realised some of their profit by selling some thereby getting others involved which is what has caused the price increase.
Bitcoin only has an ever increasing value as more people take it seriously.
Right now you could buy at $3000/coin, ask yourself if you'd sell at $6000, $12,000, etc..?  Realitically you'd have to hold on until it's at $24k a coin.  You'd be mad not to sell some during that time, so whilst the value is going up, not everyone getting in from 5 years ago has made a fortune is my point and your choice to be involved is no different now than 5 years ago.

Don't get me wrong, it's great they're making progress and fixed this but this to me is technical wanking.
The number of people using OB is absolutely negligible because **it's hard to use**, not because of obscure MITM security risks.  
Until usability is fixed it is a dead duck.  Downloading software locally, random obscure ID numbers for stores, requiring the user owns bitcoin, etc.. all are just daft for consumer focused technology.  
Instead of moaning, here are some solutions...
* Integrate with namecoin so store names can be used,
* Put a webportal version so people can easily browse and click a webaddress
* Make the database searchable a priority
* Integrate with bitpay and the likes to allow for seamless local currencies exchange (hide bitcoin usage because users don't need to see it!), etc...
They will only succeed when the very simple usecase is of minimal steps:
* Person A can simply post they are selling dentures
* Person B (not related) can find their dentures for sale using keywords.
* Person A can pay with local currency for dentures into escrow
* Person B receives the funds in their local currency when Person A releases the escrow on delivery.
It seems like it has a long way to go before this incredibly simple use case is done.

For instance I could put a bid in to buy bitcoin at $1000 right now, clearly no one is selling them that cheap at the moment so no match is made.

The blocksize arguement is about making the paper bigger.  Eventually the page size and book becomes unweildly hence there is an argument for keeping it to a lovely manageble A4 page and you just have to pay the top x% fees to get your transaction entry onto a page in the book.
The forking is that each bitcoin node has their own copy of the book.  They copy pages from each other and synchronise what the official book should look like.  A fork is when you have one group of miners/nodes that believe one page is valid and another group think the page is invalid.  For example if some of the miners said it would be ok to accept A3 pages instead of the limited A4 pages, you'd have a fork once a page bigger than A4 was produced.
Since all miners want to be adding pages to the official book everyone else will accept they look around and as soon as they see what the majority of the miners are using they swap over to that book.
During a fork, a transaction would be entered in both the A3 fork and the A4 fork just fine and life carries on as usual.  The complication is if an entry was put only in one side of the forks, this means those funds are now spendable in two different chains and how things start getting messy. 
Inevitably one fork will always win so not actually much of a risk.  Bitcoin used to fork a lot in the early days, it is designed to do this and cope well.  The issue is if someone decides to play the fork to their advantage and confidence being shaken which could reduce it's value in the shortterm until a clear fork winner appears.

The risk of investing $1000 in bitcoin 2 years ago is no different than investing $1000 today.
If you're nervous doing that today, you'd almost certainly be just as nervous 2 years ago.
The thing you need to remember is bitcoin 2 years ago they were not worth as much as they are now not from magic but because less people were involved.  If you hadn't sold them people wouldn't be using them so the price rise happened because people are trading them.
It's like that famous pizza, those coins were worth as much as they were when the trade was done.  Both people involved in the trade felt it was a reasonable deal, neither hit the jackpot or felt ripped off.  If you went back to 2010 to make that trade again, the few people involved in bitcoin at that stage would rightly consider a 0.5btc balance worthless for good reason.
I.e. don't kick yourself about missing a mere $2000-&gt;$4000 jump, that's only a doubling in price.  If you think bitcoin has more potential ahead (LN, supply halving, zsnarks, atomic swaps, etfs, national reserves, decentralised merchants, contracts, required for buying into new PoS chains, etc..) you are still be an early adopter taking risk by getting involved now.

They'd do better instead of making a totally new language, just each year pick a word to start using.
E.g. we all say 'chat' for cat, it's encouraged you can say cat or chat.  Each year add another word from another language.
e.g. 'dog' can be referred to as 'inu' .
If every country around the globe just agreed to start including that work in day to day speech we'd end up bringing languages together.
Asking anyone to learn a new language is a big ask,  asking everyon to is almost impossible.  Asking everyone to just be open minded and share a word... that seems more palatable?

It's no surprise if you look at it in retrospect.
A new altcoin was made, it was gifted a wildly inaccurate and unsubstantiated valuation of $50 billion on launch by the exchanges to match that of bitcoin.  It isn't the bitcoin hence people dump their free money for more bitcoin.
What I don't understand is how there is **any** buy side to prop up the bcash orders, there a few people out there getting annihilated... whoever is propping it up is literally giving their money away at the moment.  
It would have been more accurate if bch was launched with a market cap valuation of 0 and allowed it to increase based on supply/demand to find it's equilibrium.

blockchain.info does not store your 12 words by design so they can't steal your funds.  You need to find those to restore your wallet.  (You don't need the password).
Did you ever take a backup of your phone (is it Android/iOS?) perhaps if you restore from a backup you may get lucky and those details are cached on the phone or whereever you stored them.
Next did you ever log in from a laptop or other such device?  That too would probably still have them and just requires your password to login.
Finally have you tried the 'find your phone' option?  Having your phone stolen these days should be pretty rare given they're the most traceable thing on the planet.
Reporting it to the policy may help reunite you.

Does the node keep ASCII versions of the addresses somewhere to search like this or have they been dumping out the addresses somehow to do that grep?  I would have thought the blk files were all binary and and just had tx info so wouldn't be searchable via grep?

Whilst I agree with you, if gold were considered money and not speculatively bet on we could do this fun bit of maths...
Gold is a finite resource where we know there are approximately 165,000 metric tons of gold.
Bitcoin is also a finite resource with the magical 21,000,000 upper limit.
It seems like in a perfect world we should therefore be able to swap bitcoin-&gt;gold-&gt;bitcoin at a fixed rate (assuming gold mining is negligible)
I.e.  21,000,000 bitcoin /165,000 tonnes means
1 ton of gold = ~127 bitcoins
1Kg of gold = 0.127 bitcoins
The amusing thing is to convert this discrepancy into 
1Kg of gold valued at approximately $40,000 of todays money.
Therefore 1 btc **should** be valued at  ~$315,000.  (ok, actually half that as there are two assets being considered now but still &gt; $100k per coin)
Or put another way, someone trading their bitcoin for gold is a lunatic ;)
Ok, that is crazy as people would have to recognise why it's useful and finite but still fun to consider the possibility.

Mainly no because Breadwallet and Electrum uses different HD systems.
There are 3 Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIP) related to HD wallets.  I believe they work like this (please correct me if my understanding is wrong though!)
* BIP32 - This is how to create HD wallets.  It shows with a seed value you can create many private keys/addresses and a derivation string.
* BIP39 - This is a standard word list of 2000 words.  Each word represents a number and when combined it produces the seed number used by BIP32.
* BIP44 - This is a standard derivation path schema for cryptocurrency in general.  It is a text string and looks like this "m/0/0/1/0" or 
    m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index 
This standard way of formatting the text derives the privatekeys/addresses for an HD wallet in a compatible way unlike BIP32's which is more free-form I believe.
Right now the wallet makers are disjointed on this... sadly this is intentionally because some wallet providers (e.g. Breadwallet) don't want to be compatible so you have to use their software to access your funds.
If Electrum/BreadWallet did use the common standards then the answer would be yes since the wallet doesn't hold the actual bitcoin, those balances are stored on the global blockchain that everyone can see.  The wallet merely keeps track of which addresses you control the private keys/passwords for.
BIP44 is used on 
MyCelium, Trezor, Coinomi, MultibitHD,Ledger
There is a great spreadsheet someone did here, would be excellent if someone extended it for all wallets out there.
Basically I can no longer recommend Breadwallet and Electrum to most users because it's non-standard, instead I suggest Mycelium/Trezor/Ledger for the best user experience and having confidence you can easily recover your funds in future.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:56:32
You have to back it up frequently.  The bitcoind client creates a pool of 100 future use addresses/keys, these are included in your back up and used to send you change to or incoming funds.
This means you need to backup that wallet before you do 100 transactions since the last backup otherwise not all your funds are included in the backup.
HD wallets resolve this, with that single key (the 12 words) they derive every address (past and future) so you will only need to write down that single phrase.

There are bound to be a lot of people thinking they can play the market and give it some value.
My concern is what may be ahead, the fact that a mining cartel is pushing a split means they're going to be incentivised to do something we've never seen before.  Their weapon of choice is they no doubt have a ton of BTC mined coins they can dump on the market at once to crash the price knowing they've now got BCH to hedge with.
Given the low volumes of BCH it will make propping the price up much easier and anyone who's not aware of how mining works may simply see BTC drop in value and BCH rise.
Next they buy shed load of cheap BTC and now can do the same thing on BCH in many months time and continue making a fortune.
The only thing that seems to stop this from happening is there are no doubt some whales out there who will ditch BCH for BTC as soon as they can so becomes a game of who can change the market faster.

I'm sure you're just saying this to provoke a response but for other readers out there, litecoin does not solve scalability.  It is a multiple of bitcoin, not an order of magnitude better.  It can't handle visa/mc tx rates.  Don't get me wrong, I like LTC as a backup to BTC and I've invested in it too but it is not a scaling solution.  With the recent segwit activation on BTC, litecoin has been relegated to just a backup again.

You need to realise bitcoin in this capacity is like saying it is just a currency so your question is actually the equivalent of "How do I invest in YEN and how long will it take before I profit from it?".  I.e. you won't get more yen by just buying some and only you'll know if you profit locally from it.
Now if you live in Venezuela you can be pretty confident in buying YEN will 'profit' almost immediately because the bolivar is devaluing steadily and daily.  If your local currency is USD, EUR, GBP, YEN you may find it's not that clearcut since those currencies are pretty steady at the moment.  The only way you profit is if the rest of the world continues becoming more interested in bitcoin and the exchange price rises.
You'll find a site like this helpful to see trends over time valued in USD.
There is no guarantee increase in value with bitcoin just like any other commodity.  If your economy has inflation higher than bitcoin's inflation it's a pretty safe bet your value in bitcoin will outperform your local currency.  Bitcoin's inflation rate is currently at 4.03% reducing to around 1.73(edit to be more accurate)% in 2020.  
 
Since there can only be at most 21,000,000 btc and look at the opportunities btc opens up you can make your own mind as to why people are excited about it and if it's worth converting some local currency to a global one.

You'd only get a partial refund of fees when that miner finds blocks, ie me realise than half your txs would be 100% lost fees.
A miner could do better by not propagating the txs and obviously get 100% of the fees back BUT at the detriment of the networks usefulness which reduces the btc/usd exchange rate.
Ie a miner would be crazy to do this, much like a pro athlete runner thinking they could shoot themselves in the foot immediately after winning in the Olympics so they could potentially run and win in the paraolympics and think they could keep doing this every 4 years.

I've tried one which worked very well.  It's a good approach to mix the new system with the old but widely used payment systems.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:13:49
The connection is direct P2P between the user and a LN node.  It uses regular internet traffic protocols to update their payment channel as appropriate, no blockchain is touched except for setting up or closing the channel.
There are various routing layers being made and they are intended to all be compatible with each other so if A connects to B and B is connected to C, A will be able to make a LN payment to C.
This happens instantly and automatically via the LN system if a path can be found, otherwise a regular bitcoin transaction is just published on the internet (hopefully with confirmation first) is the expected behaviour I believe.

If HBO were to pay this, they should make sure they do it in escrow.
I.e. pay them with a 2 of 3 multisig payment such that the hacker can see they've paid BUT doesn't receive the money until the period of time has elapsed where releasing the scripts is a non-event... e.g. 6 months time.  (Or also put a time locked transaction for 6 months time the hacker can use directly without the 3rd party)
If the hackers release the scripts, HBO gets their funds back from the trusted third party.

The public/private key is referring to the address where the source funds are coming from.
More detail:
You have your private key number K.  From this you generate the public key you can safely share.  Let's call this P(x,y).  I say P(x,y) instead of just P to highlight P is actually made of two numbers.
Using P(x,y) you can calculate the familiar bitcoin address string A.
You ask the person sending you coins to send them to A.
Now when you want to spend A, you have to publish your public key P(x,y) and a signature S(x,y) to prove you can transfer the coins locked at that address.    S(x,y) is simply generated with a random number and your private key K.  I.e. K is still never shown to anyone.
Now you specify the new script that allows the funds to be moved next time... this is usually another P2PKH which uses the destination address you're sending to.

* "Do I pay to bitcoin addresses or LN addresses?"

You're somewhat right, bitcoin in it's current form will not be what the mainstream see.  There will however be a layer on top and currently LN looks the most promising implementation of this.  
An added benefit of LN is it gives instant transaction confirmations at almost no fees.  Wrap that in beautiful clients with on/off ramps to local currencies and you now have a viable bitcoin mainstream implementation.
It's not a case of if, but when because if LN doesn't solve it there are other ways to do it too.

A bitcoin wallet can be thought of as simply the password container to spend the bitcoin held on the globally accessible blockchain db.
If you delete your wallet, you don't delete your bitcoin but you do delete the passwords to be able to spend them.
Most wallets are now HD wallets, the HD means that all the passwords are derived from 1 single value called the seed.  This is normally expressed in 13 words, so if you write down those 13 words (store copies in two locations to be ultrasafe) you can now safely delete your wallet from you mobile phone/pc.   Now when you reinstall the wallet you can type in those 13 words and you'll have access to spending your funds again.
Not all wallets are the more modern HD types however.  The main bitcoin client/node is NOT an HD wallet.  Instead it creates batches of 100 passwords at a time to use.  This is why you need to back up this password set regularly, certainly before you've made nearly 100 transactions since the last backup.  (The passwords for bitcoind is stored in the wallet.dat file).
Other wallets are webwallets where you have to follow their backup procedure.  Typically webwallets are a bad idea for significant sums of money though.

Payment channel is a way of locking funds to handle micropayments.
It works like this, imagine you and another person setup a bank account where both of you have to sign cheques to make them cashable.
Now you and the other person write a cheque giving $10 back to you and you both sign this cheque dated valid 7 days from now.
Now you send $10 to the account knowing you can reclaim it safely in 7 days in worst case scenario.
Now say you want to send $1 to that person, you write and sign two cheques returning you $9 and sending $1 to the other person but dated valid in 6 days time.
You now want to spend $0.01 to that person again so now you write and sign a cheque returning you $8.99 and sending them $1.01 but dated 5 days.
This process continues until you or the other person is ready to close the payment channel by cashing in the most recent cheques.
The advantages of payment channels is it allows one way payments without hitting the blockchain until settlement.
LN is similar but very different. It allows bidirectional payments rather than one way but again only settles on the blockchain when either party closes a channel.  This means you could in theory do thousands of txs and not incur the blockchain hit and allows for instant payments.  You only need the blockchain part on setup and shutdown of a ln channel.  Equally it is interconnected so you only need one channel to access all LN nodes, much like how the Internet routing works.

For those 'blockchain yay, bitcoin nay sayers' this should highlight why blockchain is not the important thing here.

It's not an issue yet so no trivial solution is available just yet but it is easy to solve.
1. Use a trusted 3rd party to either hold funds or counter sign with limits and/or limits. This may be an institution or an individual you trust.
2. Have a safe switch that sends funds to a time locked account.
3. Wallets to have hidden accounts 
4. Fake transfers with double spend

So they saw ethereum, forked it, renamed it and called it JPMorgan tech?  I'd love to know why they forked Ethereum as I can only think of a few things that would cause such a drastic decision...
* They couldn't own the IP so had to fork it for a private weaker chain they now control to undermine Ethereum.
* Ethereum is missing a feature and that JPM don't want to share with the OS community (Unlikely given it's open source what they've done)
* Ethereum's history showing split forks actually can happen makes it too risky for a corporation to use.
That said, was good discovering Vagrant from them so the more the merrier to the alt party.

ASICs are dedicated chips to do the SHA256(SHA256(x)) mining algorithm and about a million times faster than your computer can do it.
Typically you'll be needing around 1kW of power to much through trillions of hashes a second for a chance to win a fraction of a dollar a week.
Therefore if you're doing it for profits just don't.  If you're doing it because you want to see how it all works, go for it!

I think paper wallets are old-hat these days, HD wallet seeds are vastly easier to use and can even hand writing down the 13 words it comes up with.  You can download the list of the HD words and hand pick them if you're being super paranoid about the generation process.

I don't know of any script that does it off the top of my head I'm afraid.  You'd do best running a bitcoin node with the block-notify callback.  In there you can obtain the address of the coinbase transaction and could send money to that if the segwit blocks were flagged.
E.g. read the block with this...
Obtain the 'ver' field to check for segwit activation.
ver:536870912 = 0x20000000  (i.e. this block does not signal SegWit).
Now obtain the coinbase transaction which is the first in the block
e.g. in Javascript with the response from blockchain.info...
That should be the address to send funds to.
Can probably be automated pretty easily if you wanted.

Not sure why the hardware manufacturer being around is relevant.  Absolute worst case scenario is the company disappears, they retract their open source, everyone deletes their local copies and all devices die from some weird manufacturing flaw... even in this incredibly unlikely scenario you can still recover your funds using electrum or any other compatible HD wallet using the backup phrase you must write down before you can use the hardware wallet.
All the hardware wallet bit does is ensure the private keys are never exposed to any computer, they are kept internal to the device at all times and all the signing happens inside the device itself.  
This way you have confidence plugging it in to any computer knowing your bitcoin is still totally safe even if you have every bit of malware on it.
Any tx's being signed still require you to accept the destination with a button press on the device before it would even sign it... i.e. it's incredibly secure.

It looks like Multibit HD may be compatible with Breadwallet (BIP32)  [HD Compatibility]( 
If you can get hold of a Breadwallet on iOS you may be able to enter your Multibit master seed on that and sync the wallet to find the stuck transaction.
Now Breadwallet allows for Child Pays For Parent option so you should be able to create another transaction based on your first TX but add a bigger fee to pay for both.
I've not done this myself yet so can't walk you through it but appears 
If that doesn't help you can try this from bitcointalk.org... 
You might be able to click 'replay the blocks' (which is like a rescan for the Satoshi client) and Multibit will re-download the blocks to sync up your wallet to what is on the blockchain. 
There is a menu option 'Tools | Reset blockchain and transactions' which hopefully should be self explanatory. If not, there is help available - just click on the (?) at the bottom left of the "Reset blockchain and transactions'" screen.
This may allow you to double spend the original funds... I say may because again I've not tried it myself.
I'm also trying to put together tutorials for exactly this problem but just gathering information at the moment so please share any successful steps you did to unstick it.  (Eventually the tx will just timeout so you'll get your money back as a worse case scenario)

Remember when people say its not directly comparable they are meaning general computing power and theyd be right for that.
The trick is regardless of computer being a c64 or a super computer, it takes a certain amount of time and energy to calculate a Sha256(sha256(header+nonce)) 
A supercomputer's forte isn't doing integer math so it's performance is vastly more wasteful and slower than a dedicated asic mining chip but it is still comparable because it is capable of doing the sha algorithm.
If you run all supercomputers on the mining problem its probably only as fast as a single s9 miner.
Bizarrely youd get better performance from arrays of graphics cards but even this is still insignificant compared to the asics usedby miners.
The only way enough computing power for the bitcoin network is done is with dedicated chips that are billions of times faster than the fastest high end intel chips.
So yes, pretty much the worlds entire computing power focused entirely on doing the mining algorithm wouldn't make a few percent of the minjng power currently used by the bitcoin network.
To put it into perspective around $1,000,000 on electricity is spent each day securing bitcoin.  If you somehow could swap to general CPUs instead of asics it would cost trillions of dollars per day in electricity to match the number of hashes calculated at the moment... it is that powerful.

Here's a few alternatives of satoshis and bits...
* 1BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
* 1BTC = 100,000 kiloSatoshis
* 1BTC = 100 megaSatoshis
or in bits...  (1 bit = 100 Satoshis  gives 2 decimal places like most currencies)
* 1BTC = 1,000,000 bits (lowercase vertical b with a line through it?)
* 1BTC = 1000 kilobits
* 1BTC = 1 megabit = 1 Bitcoin
choices, choices...
My personal favourite, call everything credits (1 credit = 1 bit = 100 satoshis)  (Yep tip of the hat to StarTrek's currency although I'm not really an avid Trekkie but they had some good ideas)
* 1BTC = 1,000,000 credits 
* 1BTC = 1,000 kilocredits 
* 1BTC = 1 megacredits

Trivial for a mining operator, simply a case of installing the bitcoind client they are wanting to run.  I would expect most mining operators use only a single computer to run the client but they may run a few as backups depending on how big they are.

Only time will tell... they could be the first to introduce it as the base unit to allow computers to accurately describe currencies around the world in computer terms.  
Unix did this with time by counting seconds from 1/1/1970 as the epoch time ( and is now ubiquitous for all time calculations done by computers because it's so much easier to store and calculate with.  
Bitcoin may become the **epoch of money** (may start using that in my talks ;) ).
We could have a notion of (epoch value time) describes any item of value globally.
value = (Satoshis @ epoch time)
(50000  = $0.48 of value on 2016/12/31
This would therefore take 64bits for satoshi value and 32/64 bits for epoch time depending on precision = 128bits = 16 bytes.
Compared to the string
"$0.48 USD @ 2016-12-25 12:00 UTC"
which is a headache to interpret in code.  I might just be going crazy though...

Some people just like unnecessarily worrying people like saying, "Did you know if you use a car your brakes could fail?" ... Well, no shit.  But highlighting that remotely insignificant risk is not how to encourage people to use a car and achieve all the benefits it offers.
Given there is so much rubbish around this address reuse let me help clear it up.  
** Firstly you are totally safe to publish a single bitcoin address for donations and forward the funds it receives to your own wallet as often as you like. **
The detail:
When you spend from an address the public key is made known to everyone so should ECDSA ever be cracked or you use a wallet that mishandles the random value needed in signatures (all popular wallets DO handle this random value correctly btw!), the funds donated that haven't been transferred out could be pinched.  Remember if ECDSA was cracked your money is probably not even sofa change compared to the millions of other bitcoin that could be compromised if this happened.  
So you can see these are mere tiny 'what if' risks that you can ignore unless you're accepting millions.
This leaves the only other thing, the funds received can easily be tied to say your youtube account (Not sure why I need to call this out because it's pretty bloody obvious but some people like fear mongering)... but so what.  
Unless you're doing something you're not supposed to, you have to think who cares if someone knows your bitcoin address and youtube account can be linked, I mean it's kind of the point of you publishing it asking for donations!
If you use an address for donations from your day to day spending wallet you are potentially linking your future spends to the youtube account.  If this was a problem simply use a different wallet for receiving your funds.  Again I think this is unnecessary but calling it out for completeness.
We're generally getting into the nitty gritty of how bitcoin's fungability works with detailed answers like this, so in summary I'll just say... *go ahead use the single address and you've got nothing to worry about assuming you're using a popular HD wallet*
I.e. don't overthink this stuff too much, bitcoin is vastly safer than a credit card and is safe to publish addresses on the internet because... well that's what it was designed for.

You simply use a middleman who is willing to do business with Amazon in whatever payment they accept.  Eventually someone would open up an Amazon replacement that isn't based in a country where bitcoin is banned, because... well free enterprise and efficiency.
Digital currencies are here to stay because they work far better than needing to trust a private banking system.  Govs would be foolish to to trust private profit making global companies with their entire economy... I think about that if I ever have doubts about digital currencies validity.  One country would be foolish to trust another country with their economy if you have doubts about bitcoin.
That's the bigger picture here that is an evolutionary outcome, but on a small scale for that to happen I like to believe people want to trade with people and computers and don't care about the medium used.  
For that they simply need a global standard recognized unit of value that can be transferred digitally to do that.  That unit can be expressed in their local currency so they understand the trade but the way it happens should be agnostic to country, company and currency.

AES is encryption and not used in Bitcoin.
ECDSA is what bitcoin uses for signatures.  And RIPEMD and SHA256 are the hash techniques used in bitcoin.  
Bitcoin doesn't use encryption, it uses cryptography to do digital signatures.  The two are based on the same sorts of math principals but encryption makes it so 3rd parties can't see what you are doing where as signatures merely verify you are who you say you are.  I.e. bitcoin is understandable by all, no encryption anywhere.
Many websites, especially banking, use ECDSA and a hashing algorithm including SHA256 already for identity checking.  Anything with https will use this signature/hash approach and you can tap on the green padlock in your browser to see what they are using as there are many standards.
The only non-standard thing about bitcoin is it uses very minimal magic numbers for it's elliptic curve to prove there are no backdoors.  The obscure elliptic curve parameters recommended to be used by the standards agency most likely have intentional weaknesses in to help data analysts to intercept and decode.  Bitcoin's unique curve is therefore more secure but that's about it.

I believe this is a common myth  because it would require a hard fork given current transactions express their value in integer form meaning a new field would be required to handle the extra precision (or adjusting the value field to be an encoded fixed point number).

Litecoin is excellent, I think it's important to have an almost identical codebase to bitcoin but with different POW, confirmation times (and marketing strategy).  At the moment it happily co-exists as a backup ready to overtake if necessary.
Before bitcoin didn't have segwit and litecoin got it, that is precisely where litecoin finally found a USP people wanted and no doubt will again.  That early adopter got LTC recognised by the community and why it got listed on Bitstamp (and their valuation skyrocketed as other like minded people started investing in it).  It is also why BTC finally got it's arse in gear because people were now adopting LTC.
Now BTC is looking set to get segwit too, Litecoin loses that USP so needs another to avoid being relegated.  For example if litecoin gets a LN with decent wallets on it first it could overtake BTC market and BTC would become the backup.  Equally if Litecoin gets SNARKs first it again could put it into the lead if bitcoin drags it's heels (Look at what is happening with Dash for instance).
Right now however litecoin does not scale, and does not do anything beyond what bitcoin does so has little value right now.  With fewer uses of it than for bitcoin it's value diminishes quickly.
The race is on for a simple and usable LN layer, when that happens that will become the dominant coin and could be another does it first (LTC, Byteball, etc..)  if they do it first.  Equally they help push the technology forward, if LTC implements SNARKS and bitcoin doesn't, again LTC will start eating BTC market share because fungibility is lacking in bitcoin yet a good genetic trait for financial protocols IMHO.  
I think we're just at the start of the story for litecoin and bitcoin but wanted to highlight neither have cracked the scalability problem yet.
Someone repeating litecoin solves scalability is either not aware of the technical facts or being disingenuous to promote it.

Good to highlight BLS but it's very early days and we should get BLS working successfully in an alt coin like litecoin first before mashing it into the most secure coin.
Either way BLS/Schnorr sigs are merely refinements that bring marginal improvements along with small risks (e.g. are there malleability issues or weak exploits again?) , i.e. they're not that vital to Bitcoin's success but will be good to have in time.
I'm more excited about order of magnitude scaling with LN, simple chainswaps, decentralised exchanges for fiat, all of these are vastly better for the global ecosystem than saving bytes in the blockchain IMHO.

James a few facts to correct in your next article.
It is not infinitely divisible, the smallest unit is a satoshi. A bitcoin is merely an easier way to say 100,000,000 satoshis. The fact it is not infinite is why it holds value.
It is not free to use, you have to spend actual value to transfer bitcoin.
It is not mainly used by dealers and criminals (unless they're uneducated and dont realise it leaves a permanent public record of their spending for prosecutors!) cash and bank accounts are mainly used by criminals.
After the biggest online drugs bust the value of bitcoin was hardly effected to prove this.
I for one only use bitcoin for legitimate purposes.
Without highlighting the benefits and why most people are excited about bitcoin being invented, why it is continuing to gather momentum since its release, you are doing a massive disservice to British people scaring them from understanding and embracing new technology.  There is a reason bitcoin is out performing every currency and commodity year on year, l it is finally an impartial standard unit of value that is designed for the internet.  It is incredibly revolutionary for finance and cant be stopped.
Saying otherwise is like saying the internet is only useful to businesses involved with pornography or cats.

YRuafraid has given a great answer already but just to highlight, you would do well getting the bitcoin out of Circle and Coinbase wallets into your own wallet where you control the private keys.
I.e. download an HD wallet like BreadWallet, MyCelium, Jaxx, CoPay/Bitpay wallet.
Now transfer the funds there.  This way if Circle or coinbase decide to lock your account or they get hacked/disappear your funds are still totally safe.
Think of Circle/Coinbase as your wallet in your pocket that you could potentially lose.  An HD wallet you can remember those 13 seed words it gives you and can access your funds on any device anywhere in the world even if your phone was stolen.

For newbies trying to make a quick buck they are bound to get hurt, much like 2013 bubble.  It's about long term vision, the reason it's going up is because someone is either playing the market or they see it as being vastly more valuable in future.
That reason might be because they know something the rest of the world doesn't know yet or because they believe someone else is going to implement something to make it even more valuable in future.
I.e. it isn't many people buying all at once that's driving up the price, it's because some group/collective or institution is planning on owning a lot and the cheapest way to do this is buying bits regularly over time.  If the amount of bitcoin purchased now had been purchased in one day the price would have spiked nearer the $100k mark because there just simply isn't enough liquidity to instantly satisfy this demand.  
Remember each day there is around 1800 new btc available to purchase so demand must exceed this to even sustain the current valuation, the fact it is going up shows there must be over $1.8 m invested each day (albeit the miners are probably the main investors at the moment while the price rises).

layers of security to store your funds.
simplify payments
comply with tax regulations on your behalf (many don't realise you have to sum up your purchases over the year to see if it exceeds the threshold of taxation in your nation,  this is a real PITA so someone will eventually offer this)
offer insurances on stored funds
offer a portfolio distribution service

Easiest to hardest which tends to equate to worst to best exchange rates.
1. ATMs.  There are a number of them in UK and a quick google will probably find your closest.  Literally btc to cash but you pay a heft premium.
2. LocalBitcoin Direct to your bank/paypal account.
3. Bittylicious.  Like LocalBitcoin but sellers are more vetted I believe.
4. Local exchanges (Coinfloor for instance), requires longer and ID verification which takes time the first tx you do.
5. Bitstamp/Kraken/Binance to USD.  USD to GBP via Revolut.  Slowest setup time and requires most steps verification but gives lowest exchange fees.

Let's be fair, there will always be fiats and they're not all bad even if in the grander scheme each one will inevitably fail.  
Inflation has it's usefulness in ensuring that people don't hoard money and seek to prop up the banks by earning meagre interest whilst most individuals are indirectly taxed without realising why.
The USD is a very strong fiat, it should be almost unimaginable for it to suffer hyper inflation.  
The main risk is if another currency becomes more appealing for pegging international trades to since those trades prop up the value of a fiat scheme.
That said, with the recent talks about tariffs it seems almost insane for the US to propose this idea because it will almost certainly tank the value of USD if other countries need to do less trade with them.
Either this is an incredibly clever play as part of a longer term plan by a shrewd negotiator who will back down when they've achieved whatever their longer term objective is OR is a decision made by someone thinking the USD has some sort of magical intrinsic value.
  
The risk with the later ignorant approach is tariffs will likely increase USD revenue and reduce imports but the value of the USD will tank far below what it currently is since countries are less inclined to own any because it's less useful for them.
E.g. Steel production to go up 20% but USD tanks 5% in comparison to global value is a very bad situation that could cause a massive recession.
Interesting times ahead...

Nobody will realise they're using bitcoin in 5-10 years I could believe... it's laughable that someone could pretend to know the answer to this.
My hunch is it will still be going very strong but will be the internals of how payments work and consumers will see something like Lightning Network with beautified addresses and 3rd party wallets simplifying the whole process.  The underlying unit of value however is most likely to be bitcoin since no other digital asset exists in it's own right that is capable of transferring millions of dollars globally and instantly.
Now it exists, unless it's broken, there is no need to reinvent this standard unit of value again.

Let's face it, the people who understand crypto enough to be able to hide their bitcoin tracks effectively should be wealthy enough from legitimate crypto work that there is no chance they would be involved in this sort of crime so we are talking average crypto users here.
Therefore if the person who had their funds stolen shares their source addresses online/with Interpol it is just a matter of time before these crooks slip up and one of them moves the coins and easily gets caught with irrefutable proof they were involved.
Good luck to the authorities, hope they bring those gits to justice quickly.

Get a group of people to agree to purchase a lot of bitcoin (say 20 ₿+), go on a plane to any country where you can buy bbitcoin with local bitcoin, meet up soon, atms or a local debit card.  
Buy as much as you can, return home, sell bitcoin for 20% margin, pay for the flight, keep profits as bitcoin, pay your taxes on your earnings(treat it like any other commodity), repeat and get wealthy in terms of rupees.
If this wasn't possible to do(and I'd like to know why), the rupee would have to be considered worthless to the rest of the world and you'd see vast hyperinflation.
My hunch is the rupee does hold value and the bitcoin arbitrage is just a blip so possible to do global trade from India to earn a small fortune by being a pioneer ;)
I'd do it but I don't want rupees.

It's because you spend from past transactions.  I.e. if you have a balance of say 0.5btc in your wallet it could be made of say 2 tranactions of 0.1btc and 0.4btc.
Now when you go to spend say 0.11btc it will select one of your earlier transactions (in this case the 0.4btc one) and will send the 0.11btc to the destination address you entered.  The remaining (0.4-0.11 = 0.29btc) is the change btc.  This change is sent to another address that you control.  Whilst it is possible to send this change back to an old address you have, it's good practice to create a new bitcoin address and send the change there.  Your wallet can now spend the original 0.1btc and the new 0.29btc transaction showing you a balance of 0.39btc.
Or put another way, it's just how bitcoin works and nothing to worry about :)

You've just discovered a small cave that has appeared in your back garden.  You have a choice to go in and explore a little more, you'll perhaps expect to find some wildlife but nothing more. You'll question if it's even worth your time looking or just  moving on to the next shiny thing because you've seen caves before.
 I'm telling you now that with a quick glance many inevitably see an empty cave as expected because you're not looking at it long enough, spend a bit longer, explore and understand it you'll see why many think its incredible.  This cave has appeared for a reason and is an ingenious solution to a vast problem.
The experiment itself may or may not be the one that succeeds but it will certainly enhance anyone's understanding of money if you can't see why it has any exchange value at all.
I'd always suggest giving it a reasonable amount of time to form your own opinion, I guarantee you'll learn something new and helpful regardless to if you think it is the future or not.

I would question his similarity of bitcoin to the browser.  Bitcoin is an open protocol so more akin to TCP that all the browsers still use.
I would put circle in the risky legacy browser area and they need to innovate on top of the protocol to prevent becoming the netscape wallet.  As case and point look at Wirex innovating on virtual credit cards in their bitcoin wallet.  The company that does this with a credit card that works with Apple pay, LN support and auto top up is going to become the next obvious leader... I do wish it is circle because I actually like their app so far but have a hunch a few younger companies are more visionary to progress faster.

Thanks and whilst I agree with that strategy is certainly the sensible long term approach when we know we are gradually approaching a risk, what I was suggesting however is if someone somehow fully broke ECDSA... quantum or not, it would be good to know we have a workable plan for how to protect the funds.
I.e. imagine if someone is able to do P-&gt;k in less than 10 minutes.  I know this sounds far fetched but we also can't ignore that Bitcoin gives a very significant financial incentive to keep this capability hidden.   Simply pick out strategic amounts to take occasionally means everyone else is oblivious to the compromise as long as you keep it secret.
The counterargument that the internet itself would be compromised doesn't help me sleep at night since there aren't any more lucrative/low risk usecases than stealing crypto on the internet with that capability and probably far easier and less traceable ways to break websites if that was the intention.
So in this crazy hypothetical scenario, at this point Bitcoin needs an emergency solution, migrating to a quantum secure algorithm probably wouldn't be enough since the regular ECDSA pub key still needs to be published to protect the funds.  
Trying to save funds at this stage would be like crossing the crocodile ridden Serengeti river hoping the attacker can't compromise many txs per block.
I'm not suggesting we write any code to solve it, more just contemplating how it could be sensibly tackled...
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:51:28
A stats page would be helpful.
E.g. Show what 1 bitcoin is worth in terms of the major currencies and gold/silver.
Show an index price using the IMF special drawing rights makeup.  (E.g. x% USD + y% GBP + z% EURO +... )  to show how BTC can be used to express a unit of global value/reserve currency.
Would also be helpful showing where the market cap of bitcoin ranks on the M1 level of countries.
Perhaps also a value of the amount of bitcoin moved in the last 24 hours.

Firstly **stop installing apps on the phone or using any apps on it until you've read this.  Browsing the internet on your phone may also destroy any chance of recoving them** 
I'm not sure how Mycelium works on Android, if it's internal memory, the only option I can think of is if you happened to backup your phone before you wiped it.
If it is on the SD card, there is a chance you can take it to a data recovery center who may be able to extract that file.    My hunch is mycelium would save it to the phone's internal memory given this is vastly more secure though but you never know!
Ok, I'm curious so looking a bit more... it's Christmas after all.
Looking here... 
It appears thought it uses an SQLite DB file called 'walletbacking.db' 
so this is the file you need to find.
Given it uses Android's SQLite implementation, from this bit here..
It looks like the file location is probably something like  (I say something like because I've really not double checked this other than quick glance at their code)
    /data/data/com.mycelium.wallet/databases/walletbacking.db
Which I believe is internal phone storage location on Android.
Now to a quick google shows it may well be possible to recover files after a factory reset if you have a backup OR you haven't been doing much on your phone that could have wiped the old files.  
You will need to make sure your phone is rooted to even attempt a non-backup recovery though.
Here is one approach from a bit of google-fu
(I can't vouch for that software being legit, just was the first result in google).
If you have any IT experience you may be more comfortable with installing the Android SDK on your PC/mac and using the ADB command line utility like this
Again, you're hunting for that file 'walletbacking.db' probably found in /data/data/com.mycelium.wallet/databases/walletbacking.db.
Once you have that file, you can recover the funds and I'm sure peeps at MyCelium would be happy to explain how to restore your old version (typically will just be copying this old recovered file over the new one at a guess)
Don't give up on crypto's, these are the sort of learning pains we need to go through to make it robust. Have a think what could have been done so you didn't get in this situation and put it forward as a suggestion to the Mycelium team.  E.g. Allow storing this backup file to a cloud server, making the key deterministic, offer a 2 of 3 key recovery system whereby your encrypted parts can be emailed to other people... etc...
Best of luck!

Please only do this if you're wanting to learn how mining works, don't do it to make money... you'll be very disappointed with the return on USB miners.
To put it into context a 30,000MHash device will only make you a few cents a day.  That 330MHash device will make you a few cents in the year.
If you actually want to mine for profit, mining bitcoin is incredibly expensive these days.  You'll need a ANT Miner S9 or equivalent running in the terrahash area.
Most hobby miners actually mine some other crap alt coin (ethereum is probalby more profitable) and immediately dump swap their coins on crypto-&gt;crypto exchanges like shapeshift back into bitcoin.
Basically I'd only ever recommend mining for the experience of saying you've done it.  Unless you have mega money and free electricity it's almost certainly a loss making exercise for the first year.

Somewhat misleading title, this isn't about bitcoin but about all crypto currencies and how to handle the future where transactions no longer use central banks.  
The computer scientists appear to agree it is inevitable that banks will become a redundant bottleneck for transactions in future. There is little they can do to prevent technology advancing and optimising payment gateways out so instead how do they adapt?
They are not worried about bitcoin because it's a public ledger... at the moment.  The article indicates they are more concerned about zcash types taking off as those are not auditable.

Sorry just saying it slightly in jest because I struggle to use my Amex when travelling, mainly because they charge merchants such a high fee so they typically only take visa/MasterCard.
Also as a merchant they are liable if i decide to issue a chargeback so if someone used my card details online its just an inconvenience while they take the money back from the shops. 
On a more serious note however, transferring money directly between people is easier with bitcoin. It also makes many new payment models possible solutions ch as machine to machine payments.
That said, for someone whos got a good banking system the main uses are investment diversification, direct trade, starting a new venture with what the tech enables or accepting large purchases like cars.

I can't speak for KeepKey but I can comment on Trezor and say it is safe.
The reason being is the private key is never exposed, ever, to the computer.  The hardware wallet by design only signs transactions so the only 'hack' attack would be to change the destination address being requested to be signed.  The problem with this attack vector is it would be blatantly obvious since you have to confirm the destination address on the physical hardware wallet before confirming.  I.e. it's safe.
Even extracting the xpub keys requires confirmation on the hardware device and this process is safe to do anyhow.  All in all, trezor seems incredibly well locked down.  Only viable attack vector is someone physically stealing your 12 word backup phrase somehow (and yes you can protect against that a little too by having an extra secret word).
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:12:34
Not that I'm aware of, at least for historical transactions.
If the address starts with a '3' it will reduce the set of wallets you've sent it to as this is a multisig address that not many wallets use.
If you're comfortable sharing the address I'm sure others can take a look to see if there is anything special about the transaction that would highlight the source wallet.

The tech directors there must be pulling their hair out shouting 
"No no no, we merely pushed the term blockchain because bitcoin had an image issue, we didn't mean ditch bitcoin.  Are you fucking mad?  How on earth are you going to secure it, are you really going to spend anywhere near the million dollars a day protecting it's security to even compete with Bitcoin's level of security?  Do you know how many alt coins are already out there that already vastly eclipse what a private company's level of security can offer?  They already have fiat locked chains, it's been done and doesn't work.  Do you even know why blockchain is just a bullshit marketing word in this context?  Only one financial blockchain can survive and it will be the strongest open chain available.  
A blockchain is nothing more than a mega long text file ledger with signatures, it doesn't scale to corporate levels in itself or really solve much of a problem other than decentralisation.  Only when mixed with mining and finite resources does it begin to have any tangible value.  The only reason the bitcoin blockchain is working is because it has a unit of value not dependent or controlled by a corporation or nation that people can trust.  Don't believe me?  Look at R3, MasterCard and the swards other crap that has failed trying this flawed idea or bundling fiat bound assets.  You're considering making yet another Ripple where the clued up developers won't touch and the financial institutions believe they can do better themselves.  Once you realise that fails you'll opt for the transferwise remittance approach which again is only helpful for remittance, not generic payments. Please listen to us, this is a suicidal move removing our only USP of such a small company where we are leading the way.  We worked our asses off making this thing amazing and you're about to turn it into the windows 3.1 of the blockchain wallets"

I used coinb.in with 2 computers because I wanted to do it offline and verify the tx was valid before going anywhere near an internet connected machine.  
This will only work on bitcoin I believe, no idea about that btg and bitcoin cash but expect it’s a similar process or simply import the private key in electrum equivalent after you’ve safely moved the important stuff.
This approach should be done one a small valued paper wallet first so you’re comfortable with it. Pay particular attention to the mining fees being reasonable (not too high and not accidentally sending all funds to the miners!!!)
*The basic rule here is NEVER let your private key be used on a connected machine.*
Run coinb.in on an offline Machine (ideally fresh install from CD) and verify the integrity matches the signature.
Next on the online machine load coinb.in too and now load the source address of your paper wallet. generate a tx to send the funds to your new address. 
Now having an unsigned tx prepared online(checking the mining fees are right) you can manually copy this  unsigned tx to the offline computer and now you can enter the private key to sign the tx on the offline machine and save again.
Finally copy the signed tx back to the online machine and import it/verify it to double check. If you’re happy with the tx simply publish it on the internet whenever you want to send the funds. (coinb.in or blockchain.info make this trivial)

This is genuinely scary... even smart people somehow don't see the danger here between a central bank issued fiat physical currency and an overseas private company controlling their money.  This is a disaster waiting to happen. 
What happens when the government finds it can't pay it's bill because the foreign company said no?
What motivation does a private company have for running multiple currency support if they control more than half of the nation's transactions?
If a group want to control the world they'd no longer need to use guns to bring about control and taxation... we are heading towards a world where unelected private companies could have far more political power than our elected governments do... all from a convenient swap of coins and notes to tappy tappy cards.

Sadly, whilst the credit card systems are so incompetently insecure this markup is inevitable.  
PayPal suffered the same issues and actually gave up trying to stop fraud since the flaws are fundamental to how the cc system is designed.  The advantage PP has is they can normally reverse deposits that are later deemed fraudulent, bitcoin clearly is actual value transferred so this isn't possible.
I have to admit it took me a while before I understood why this absolute certainty of a transaction is a good thing and not actually bitcoin's problem.

Terms of using visa in your business is you can't charge a different amount for using their service...  i.e. you're right they have to bump up their prices for all payments just because someone may choose to use visa.
Crypto have fees too at this moment so I'm not sure this is an apple vs apple comparison.

You don't own the bitcoin in an exchange wallet, merely it's an IOU that they will pay you bitcoin if you ask for them.
The issue is the exchange may get hacked and have their bitcoin stolen, they may run off with your funds, they may be forced to close by their national laws, etc...
If you have an HD wallet (e.g. BreadWallet, MyCelium, Electrum) or a hardware wallet (Trezor, Keypass) or cold storage (e.g. bitaddress.org) it means YOU own the bitcoin and can control where to send them.
If you know the backup phrase (or private key for coldstorage), you can spend them at any date on any internet connected computer with just that.

Do you have any idea what the password might be?  Blockchain.info will not have this information, it is stored on your computer.  They purposefully don't have access or the ability to reset the password to ensure they can't lose your funds.
If you can obtain the encrypted wallet you have you could probably try brute forcing the password with their help.
Here is a tool to help.

More P2P systems would pop up.  Localbitcoins is good but is still somewhat centralised, this need not be the case but there is just no demand to have a more complex P2P system yet.
Bitsquare.io is probably more P2P approach but this is needing the fiat side to be smoother.
At extremes:
* Trade by proxy with someone else, e.g. ask person B to make the trade where it is legal in their country.
* Collector coins sold that contain btc.
* Drone money pickup.
* Transactions by HAM or carrier pigeon.
* Invest in overseas funds that invest in bitcoin
Basically, it can't be stopped and would take a vast amount of effort and oppressive behavior to even try to stifle it.  
It would also make zero proof knowledge systems become vastly more popular and become totally untraceable, at least with bitcoin the transaction history is open and public.

Saving your seed as a file is probably a terrible idea. Unless that computer never touches the Internet you'll never know if it is compromised until it's too late. Also you'll need to keep it as a backup on another computer for when. Your first computers hd dies. Again doubling the chances it gets discovered by a virus which hunts specifically for these sorts of things 
This is why wallets ask you to write it down instead of saving a file.
A hw wallet is no doubt the most secure approach but they aren't cheap.

Actually i don't think DistinctSituation is correct here.  Technically [blockchain.info]( could be malicious and generated you a seed it knows how to generate itself however it's reputation is on the line in doing the right thing so seems unlikely they'd intentionally do that.
The purpose of [blockchain.info]( was a web wallet where they don't have access to your key (hence if you lose that they can't help restore your funds!).
I used them for years and was fine.  Their migration to an HD seed approach from old wallets was a disaster, at least from my usage any why I stopped using them, but I think if you've started on an HD wallet with them it should be smooth sailing.  If you're storing vast sums of money on it however I'd recommend looking at a HW wallet like Trezor/ledger etc... instead.
[Blockchain.info]( is more a middle ground between a centralised wallet vs hardware wallet.

Perhaps, the security through obscurity is never good if that is the security, given how powerful this side computer is and I'm confident Intel know more than I do I'd be absolutely dumbfounded if they aren't using signatures / cryptography for securing any updates to it. The obscurity is merely to slow things down. Unless they screwed up like Sony did with reusing what should be random values and someone spotted many network packets targeting this subsystem, it is unlikely any hacker will have that key yet.  If they do, well... Bitcoin isn't the most lucrative thing they'd have access to since most banks and trading platforms will be wide open too.
Anyhow, I hear your sentiment and whilst I agree it's technically possible in a targeted way, it's not for bulk compromising because you'd find a pattern in the seed values ( not to.mention the code wouldn't use the /rnd function from the OS as the only form of entropy too)  I just think there are easier, more certain things to make money from than compromising a some late adopter cold storage wallets... 
I do however think it is a massive security threat for companies going forward.  If it becomes common knowledge you can bet Intel/Amd will lose a massive amount of global business due to the risk it presents... Somewhat unbelievable they've done it really.

I think you might be mixing things up at the moment.
Firstly transactions. To spend money from your account, what you are doing is forwarding funds from a previous transaction which you control (ie have the private key number that generated that address A) to new address that someone else controls.
When you create this transaction of funds 'from A send to B' you need to prove you control A. To do this you, or more accurately... your wallet, will take your private key number K and publish the matching public key number P as well as a signature with the statement of 'send x btc from A to B'
A signature is just a clever way to show that you know 'k' . It cant be faked, and can nly be done if you know k.
The signature proves this fact but doesn't actually publish K anywhere so others can verify the signature is correct because it matches the public key and transaction statement.  If this sounds confusing dont worry, its enough to know that k isnt shared and a transaction can only be made if you know the private key of the address youre sending funds from.
Now mining... this is just a clever way to randomly select someone around the world to verify the signatures in the recent transactions are correct. 
Can someone change the rules to make more ₿? Yes, but you have to convinced everyone else that it is something they want to agree to otherwise your changes are ignored by everyone.  Generally this makes it impossible to make such a drastic change, especially something like the amount available.
@_date: 2016-12-18 19:51:12
A couple things to help clear up your mindset. 
There is no such thing as a 'bitcoin', instead there are transactions.  A transaction has a source(s), destination(s), and a value in it like transfer from xxxx to yyyy 1.2 bitcoin.  
When a group of transactions are gathered together and the mining math problem is solved by someone, that forms a block which goes at the end of the blockchain.
The miner gathers transactions that it sees waiting for confirmations PLUS a special transaction (called a coinbase transaction) that credits their own bitcoin address the reward allowed (currently 12.5btc).
That mining problem is a simple logical maths problem where you condense this proposed block into a number.  Now you do the simple maths function with this number and what's called a nonce number.  The result is another number that is essentially random BUT if you put those exact values in again you will always get that number.
Now the mining problem is just finding a resulting number less than some threshold.  Simple :)
The trick is the probability of finding the answer is you need to do an obscene number of nonce guesses. The whole purpose is to randomly select someone around the globe who will verify the ledger.
This threshold is dynamic and reevaluated every two weeks by the network. 
This means it can be harder or easier to solve in future.  Ie it doesn't always get harder! The threshold is calculated such that with the same computing power on the network again, each block will take on average 10 mins to find. 
The reason it typically gets harder is because the value of bitcoin is rising and therefore it's worth throwing more computing power on the network to try and win making those 12.5 ₿ blocks.

No, I mean each time you spend money it takes a previous transaction (say it has 0.5btc in) and you send 0.1 btc to someone else.  The remaining 0.4btc is now sent to a NEW address that your wallet created in that pool of 100.    This means if you do more than 100 transactions without backing up, all that change is not stored in a backup.  This could in theory be your entire balance!
The bitcoin client since version 0.13 is however an HD wallet apparently but I've not tried this myself.

Because it's one of the rules of the bitcoin system.  There will never be more than 21,000,000 bitcoins.  The new bitcoin are added into the eco-system every 10 minutes or so by the algorithm that produces a reducing number over time.  At the moment 12.5btc are generated every 10 mins and in 2020 it will halve again to 6.25btc/10mins.  
If you add these all up until the year 2140 you get to the magic 21 million number.
It's rather misleading what a bitcoin is as people believe it is a 'thing' when actually it's just shorthand for describing 100,000,000 atomic units used to measure value in bitcoin called satoshis.  
I.e. Satoshi's are the smallest unit that can't be subdivided so we should really say there will never be more than
2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis.  There are just too many 0's in that number hence why the shorthand unit of 'bitcoin' is used.

Which wallet(s) are you using?
The fund will have either made it to the destination or they are still in your original wallet, there is no other possibility if that's of reassurance. 
Most likely your source wallet has had the funds returned to it and not detected, this just needs to rescan the blockchain to get the correct balance.  If you're using blockchain.info I've heard rumour there might be an issue with it handling this rejected transaction problem and you may do well contacting them if you are using that wallet.
For a better answer perhaps share the wallet you're using and/or the txid if you don't mind associating that tx with your reddit account.

Make sure you pick an HD wallet where you control the private keys.  Nearly all exchanges hold the private keys for you, avoid these to store money in long term as they are a honey pot for hackers.
If you have a mobile phone, they are excellent and convenient.  A few good ones in alphabetical order  
BreadWallet, Co-pay, MyCelium.    (For simplicity I normally just point people to  which links through to an appropriate good HD wallet for new users based on the device they click the link on)
On Desktop you can run the bitcoin full node (takes around 50Gb of diskspace) but if that's too heavy weight you can run a wallet like Electrum or Multibit which are all HD wallets and light weight needing only a few Mb.
Keep in mind with an HD wallet, you can write down your 13 words, send money to that wallet and now safely delete the wallet app from your computer/phone.  Later you can restore the wallet with all your money with those 13 words.  
If you are going to store significant money in bitcoin or for a long time, invest in a Trezor wallet.  They are HD wallet hardware the offer the best security out there IMHO.

SHA256 miners will only work on bitcoin and other proof of work coins that use that algorithm to mine with.  I believe litecoin uses "scrypt" which is totally different algorithm.  Ethereum uses ethash I believe which again is different.
So in answer to your question, no, those USB sticks won't be useful for those.
If you want to try mining, try something that is CPU or GPU based mining and work from there.  Ethereum offers a GPU mining hashing algorithm but again expect to spend a few thousand dollars on getting a working setup that actually earns any money.
I'm afraid I can't point you to it as I haven't researched it myself recently.
If you want to be more profitable faster I'd suggest writing something that is useful and ideally only accepts bitcoin.  Look at 21.co and their tutorials to get started if you've not done this before.  They also offer cheap hardware that will allow you to write embedded systems if you're keen on the raspberry pi stuff but you don't need to use their HW.

Last year I went into the SF dealership and asked them if they'd sell a car for bitcoin, no delays, just the keys within \~30 mins (I expected they'd want 3 confirmations and some paperwork doing).  Bizarrely they didn't laugh me out of the place and actually did say 'we don't take bitcoin yet'.

If you expect to buy bitcoin now and sell in 6 months to be super rich you’re better off at the casino.
The more exciting approach is to buy some bitcoin, learn how it works and buy stuff with it like another bank account.  The brilliant bit is no bank is needed so any recession or bank fees can be avoided.  Bitcoin ecosystem is far from perfect but it is getting better every day.

If I were selfish I'd say sweep the coins simply because it means those who still have untouched Casascius coins appreciate in value faster.  Sensibly I'd suggest NOT redeeming it though, this will immediately drop it's value to it's intrinsic value of 1BTC + some shitcoins = \~130% of it's value.  (To redeem it, yes it's just the private key under the hologram.  Once you peel that hologram the coin is pretty much worthless even if you don't sweep it)
What you have there is a rare piece of history and will become ever more sought after because people can't resist having treasure to showcase.
If it's got an error on it that is even rarer. I wouldn't be surprised for the normal 1BTC coins to be worth 3BTC+ some day as they are the worlds first bit of limited edition digital art with intrinsic value.  Even if BTC gets replaced with a better crypto in future those coins will still have massive amount of value.
Imagine someone trying to say the cost of the statue of David was just the cost of the marble that has been polished...

Im no expert in this but my understanding is...
Its like you put your deposits in glass brief cases.  Eg you put $5 in one and $10 in another.
To open a brief case and take the money you have to pay $1 (mining fee).
You can now hand around these briefcases to trade with anyone. Anytime the person holding the briefcase wants the money in it they can open the briefcase.
The trick is only the current person holding the case can open it, not people before.  This information about which person owns which briefcase is what a statechain stores.
Ie this handing the briefcase between people is all handled off the main blockchain and can happen almost instantly and guaranteed with only a small degree of trust in the network needed.
It can also lock us other cryptocurrency in the briefcase so makes things like atomic swaps easy.
The drawback is you cant subdivide what is in the briefcase.
You also cant change the amount in the suitcase.

If you're after the amount of money after fractional banking multiplier or if your including the money in derivative/stocks/shares you're after things like M3 value.

Because this question gets asked a lot I'm afraid and sometimes it's done by timewasters to only belittle cryptocurrencies...
Reading through the comments I've not seen anyone actually give you a decent reply yet so here goes...
Bitcoin private keys are built on elliptic curve maths, basically that private key number produces a public key number (well two numbers but can consider it one number).  Call the private key number 'k', the public key it generates 'P'.  There are something like 2 \^ 224 possibilities of valid 'k' numbers (my values might be out as doing it from memory).  This is such a vastly large number that if we were to take a regular PC starting at 1 and adding 1 again and again, it would take more energy than we think there is in the entire universe to do and certainly more time than the universe has existed... it's an unfathomable number.
So this 'brute force' approach will never work.  What can happen however is someone might find a trick in the ECDSA maths.  So when a transaction is published you publish a challenge that typically takes knowing that private number 'k' to produce a valid answer based on the information present in the last tx.  If someone manages to figure out going from public key 'P' back to 'k' it would be considered compromised.
Now ECDSA is so widely used that should someone 'crack' that, all banking systems and the internet would become vulnerable... bitcoin would be the least of our woes.   Now this has happened in the past, Sony for instance made a mistake in their signing algorithm of ECDSA and this subtle bug meant it was possible to derive k from P and is how the PS3 was hacked.  Clearly the guys working on cryptocurrency get a lot more peer-reviews and testing since money is being transacted that any flaw like this would likely be found by now.
That said it may be possible with Quantum computing, HOWEVER bitcoin also doesn't publish the full public key of the receiver in transactions, it typically publishes a HASH of the public key.  I.e. it's like a fingerprint that only the public key number can generate.  
Many other public keys (and therefore private keys) can also generate that hash number in a tx but again it's a numbers game.  There is something like 2\^192 numbers you'd have to check to find a duplicate... again it's not happening in the lifetime of the universe.  This part is unlikely to be solved by quantum computers since it's about a series of bit shifting operations rather than maths.  Something QCs are rubbish at.
Also only when going to spend the coins is the public key actually revealed and why people say you should always avoid reusing a bitcoin address for security.  If ECDSA were to be compromised, the public key-&gt;private key 'crack' would have a very small window (the time for the next block) before it were possible to steal.  Even with a QC it's unreasonable to expect it to compromised a 256 bit ECDSA key in under 10 minutes... not impossible but unlikely.
So in summary, yes bitcoin is safe for the foreseeable future and if both the ECDSA and SHA256 hash do somehow get compromised in our lifetime it is also feasible to migrate to another signature system that is resilient to whatever attack happened since it's a distributed community that enforces the rules of what makes a valid transaction.  I.e. people running bitcoin want it to be secure so can adapt if obviously needed and has happened in the past.

So the ECDSA public key in a pending tx is the vulnerable part if I understand this correctly, therefore perhaps it would be prudent to look at how we solve this.
One idea I wanted to suggest for discussion, if instead of publishing the full tx we allow the issuer to publish a hash of the tx along with details of the tx such as mining fee available, time of issue, output script.  Now that hash is put into the ledger for the miners.  When the block is found, the full tx can be published by the originator  safely knowing that the hash has been confirmed and because it is already in the blockchain no one can double spend it.  The downside is some antispamming approach is needed since this could be easily abused.  Perhaps a proof of work on that hash itself so a (nonce + the tx hash)=&gt; gives valid txhash.  (edit: for clarity I mean the client/user's machine does this pow)
Would be reassuring if we had a clear plan on what we do should ecdsa be broken.

I think the wallets need to do a better job on explaining what exactly they are doing.
Firstly wallets like MyCelium/Armory/etc. are doing two things.  Firstly they store the passwords, secondly they scan the blockchain to see how much bitcoin those passwords currently allow you to spend.
This distinction is important and why you have to wait for the syncing.  So in order to spend bitcoin you need a wallet to scan all the transactions that have ever happened from the start of bitcoin up to now.  Typically there are tricks that make it scan much faster than having to go through the entire blockchain but normally a wallet will scan all transactions that have happened since the last time it opened to know which funds are still available to spend.
This means you can export the private keys(i.e. passwords) and import them to another wallet at any time, whether that wallet is synced or not.  All wallets will cope with this because it's the design of how bitcoin works.
If you know you've not spent any funds, you can actually generate a transaction offline manually to spend the funds at any time without needing to sync anything.  Take a peek at [coinb.in]( for example.
That said I'd never suggest doing this unless you really know what you're doing as there is no 'undo' when publishing your transactions and you need to keep those private keys safe.
So to answer your question, yes you can import your wallet to mycelium anytime without having to wait for Armoury to sync.

Whilst I'd like to believe it, it's probably safer to calculate the minimum... i.e. miners are putting out around 400,000,000Gh / second.
Imagine 0.5Watts per Gh is required (this is more efficient than vast majority of miners) we're talking 200MWatts of power.
Taking a finger in the air approach of say $0.15 per kW = at least $30,000 per day running costs.
This doesn't take into account the cost of hardware amortisation, staff, premises, network fees, cooling, etc...   So could easily believe it's in excess of $100k per day in costs that require bitcoin-&gt;fiat happening.
I.e. This is the absolute minimum that must be cashed in to just break even.
$100k per day still = A minimum of $36 million of new fiat money per year entering the ecosystem to hold the price and it's likely to be much higher given the number of off book trades occurring and miners probably wanting to make a profit and not just break even.

It is possible to condense an entire block down to it's header and merkle root hash.  
That's enough proof that the block contained valid and verified transactions at some point in the past, it's now possible to discard that block after a period of time for most nodes using the pruning feature.  
Signatures for old blocks are not even checked by bitcoind  (I think it's only something like the last 6 months is verified)
Major nodes may want to retain these full audit/rebuild txs and we need a good number of these for new nodes to sync against but once synced most don't need this information.  
Next comes segwit.  Certainly segwit transactions can have their signature data thrown away after a period of time since we only need to know the tx details for old transactions.  I'm not sure if segwit does currently throw away signature data yet though, my hunch is it doesn't yet but happy to hear otherwise.
It's therefore hard to see what advantage schnorr signatures would benefit over segwit + discarding old witness data?
The biggest issue with bitcoin is it's a linear log file recording everyone's transactions so will rightfully have an upper cap on tx throughput.  Creating a tree chain or LN or something more scalable is going to inevitably gain mainstream adoption so I'm not sure how schnorr sigs help solve this bit yet.

Im guessing you are kidding about the cloud one or its heavily encrypted.
If anyone does do this you may like to consider splitting the 24 words into 2/3rds each, so 16 words on one backup (words 1-16), 16 words on the second backup(8-24) and 16 words on the final third (1-8,16-24) so you need two of the backups to get the funds.

I have to reply to this as I think you've misunderstood a fundamental technical issue with mining (or I have in which case I'm happy to be corrected)...
Mining is a 0 sum game.  More and more people will do it until it is simply not profitable to do it any more.
This is why if the price spikes we see everyone jump on the mining band wagon and when the price drops we see the hash rate reduce as people have to turn off their machines.
The next halving of tax/rewards will certainly kick a lot of mining machines out of the game and the hash rate goes down so difficulty drops too... just like it did with the 50BTC-&gt;25BTC halving years ago.  Those machines that will be shut down are the older less efficient hardware whilst the efficient 0.5Gh/W machines will remain online (or those who have access to cheap/free electricity).  
This means if every miner turns off 1/2 their hardware they'll be earning 1/2 as much but use 1/2 as much electricity.  Yes their fixed costs are the same and yes amortisation is going to spike but at a high level this is what happens.  If anything, halvings like this are going to hurt the big server farms more than hobby miners as they can easily turn their equipment on/off whereas a farm is either earning a profit or it's out of business time and someone else will pick up their share of the money.
I.e. mining is incredibly robust to halvings and the price doesn't have to double to remain secure.

I.e. someone could run a node, detect public keys, calculate the private key, now issue a new transaction with a bigger fee before the block is created and bam the money is gone.
Clearly wouldn't work every time but would work enough to warrant the system needing upgrading. 
One solution could be to simply update the version number and encryption used for new transactions so apart from that first spending transaction that would move the coins to a new signature system it would make bitcoin secure again.
P2SH outputs may also be protected too but will let someone more qualified confirm or deny this.

If you get a quantum computer with several thousand qubits I believe breaking a public key-&gt;private key is actually very fast via a modified Shors algorithm.
Here's the history of QC so far in the public domain... 
* In 2001 IBM factored 15 into 3x5, i.e. solved up to 2^4 factorisation.
* In 2012, more generic solution factored 143 = 2^8 
* In 2014 factored 56153 = 2^16
So extrapolating just the last two years it is conceivable QC will reach factoring 256 bit values within 8 years.
It would be naive to think military depts don't have vastly more powerful QCs since the machines are shown to be technically possible and it's just complicated and expensive to do... with little commercial interest in QCs it's exactly the sort thing an R&amp;D department would pick up.
If invented I doubt they'd be turned towards bitcoin simply because having a QC is only advantageous if others don't realize they exist.

You may like to take a peek at there's a number of open source ways of doing it there.
Without a payment processor like BitGo, BitPay, Blockchain.info or Coinbase you can run a bitcoind client on a server somewhere (probably separate from your webhosting server) which only listens for RPC calls from your webserver's IP address.  Now you can generate new addresses via this mechanism.
Personally I'd suggest BitGo since they use HD multisignature system which is incredibly robust but is rather complicated to get started.
If you do want to do it yourself, you may find a node package like this helpful too?

If it's a reenactment of 2008 banking crisis I'm confident bitcoin's fiat value will rocket given it is precisely why it was made.  It is independent of the banking system and can continue to work globally even if the banks shut down or lock funds.
Imagine someone who is aware of how to buy bitcoin receives a note saying they are to 'temporarily retain 10%' of your savings to help with the liquidity issues they are having.  Will they 
A) Keep calm and carry on trusting that bank
B) Purchase assets that the bank can't seize.
If B would they want to invest in property if the mortgage market was going to the toilet?  Or invest in business that rely upon banks to trade?  Most likely they will invest in commodities and now Bitcoin will likely make up a significant portion of this.
If it's a market crash it's hard to say, it is emotionally driven so depends on how whales feel it will move which will move it.

There's a bit of marketing going on too.
Bitcoin has received a lot of association to nefarious uses on the dark Web, mtgox, ransom ware, etc... so people talk about the blockchain and why it's revolutionary. The fact that bitcoin is the most powerful blockchain by a vast order of magnitude means most are talking about bitcoin, some seem to think the two are separable but it seems unlikely as there is little use in using a weaker chain for global public access (look at how most alt coin values decline after launch)

I think you've got an awesome idea and should eventually be picked up... I've been looking for something like this and considering writing one myself... it's a bit like a simple bitgo from what I can see so far but intended for banking and business usage.
A couple things that might be hurting the pitch is your page is incredibly technical... i.e. only people capable of doing this themselves are going to understand what the heck you're talking about and in which case they may just think why not write their own ( I encountered this problem a lot in my previous job! ).  For investors, bankers, bank IT new to cryptos, you need to waaaaaaay simplify it and offer the technical details as a 'More advanced info here...' button but instead focus on the problem it solves.  Seriously.  I mean I'm interested in it but my eyes were drying up reading it too as it's really heavy tech detail rather than a sales pitch as to why I would want to try it.
If I understand it correctly you're essentially allowing clients to have a weak brainwallet phrase because it's a 2 or 3 multisig HD wallet.  This means the securing entity (Is that you?) or the bank would have to sign the user's transaction to make it work. 
There are a lot of caveats to consider here such as I don't think the bank would want you signing a transaction of their clients... the banks are the ones you should be able to trust.  Therefore that key would best be given to a gov or FSA rather than yourself, I.e. an entity that already overseas the banks and would want that control... actually they'd be the ones I'd pitch this to and make sure this 2 of 3 HD multisig approach is a requirement in the bitbanklicense!
Secondly the interface is very raw.  The amazing thought and tech you've put behind this is slightly overshadowed by this.  Get a UI person in for a day or two to make it beautiful and simple with a responsive site and simple (again really simple) demo site to try.
Thirdly, is this open source?  I'd love to consider using this on my project but I absolutely must control and own that bank server code... otherwise it's too easy to put a backdoor in.
I trust you'll see I'm being brutally honest on first impressions as I really do like your product and think you're onto something excellent.
As people come to understand HD multisig wallets are the best practice in business your solution is going to get a lot of attention if you market it right... best of luck for the future and let me know if there's anything I can help with!

Anyone can build a satellite dish and download live bitcoin data.  Yes it sounds insane to build a satellite dish, but it only takes one person in the country to do it and there you have it within the 'wall'.
Equally someone bringing a USB stick with the latest blocks would do it, or short wave radio or VPN or laser connection over border or .... basically any disconnection would only be temporary because they can't block all communication in this day and age.
You're right though, it won't stop people from trying to make national internets again, but it failed before and inevitably will fail again if tried.

If you don't reuse addresses you can be certain they haven't screwed up the K value generation.
That to my mind is nothing compared to the quantum flaw... with cubits already shown to work in some universities it just takes one student with access to a 256 cubit machine and I expect they'd be able to crack all reused blockchain addresses probably in less than a day.  Clearly not happened yet and probably many years away from it but it is very likely to happen in our lifetimes.  Not reusing addresses makes this simple attack impossible.

It's also the misrepresentation of what a fork is, people are talking about it like Bitcoin wasn't designed for hard forks or think they've not happened before.
Fear of the unknown makes many jump to daft conclusions like funds could be at any risk due to a fork or the system may break somehow (the truth is the funds are still totally secure and accessible even if a hardfork were to happen, bitcoin has had hard forks before and will have more in future)
Just needs time to settle and sanity will prevail.

I expect it's merely a cautious step.
For instance I'm not sure what would stop someone generating an empty 10 Petabyte block and just update the headers so it's always the latest block.
They only need to win the block reward once, clog up the system meaning everyone is falling over/going offline downloading a stupidly big file meanwhile that miner can ignore it and build the longer chain so that when the 10Pb block is eventually discarded they're lovely new long chain is ready to go with 100% of the rewards they've earned.
Probably some flaw in this logic but unlimited block sizes open up attacks like this at a guess.  Exponentially growing and/or based on historical size seem a sensible option.

Ok, thanks.  It seems a pretty minimal risk for general users though, I mean a malicious server can only fake crediting btc to a person, it can't take their funds?
I totally get exchanges/merchants have a risk if they connected to a malicious server so the full bitcoind is best for them (and this risk should be called out) but for phone users, home users and the likes it seems reasonable they're safe enough to use while improving usability?
(I've started a node on a 10Gb connection and it's 5 days in from syncing and still 10 weeks remaining)  Admittedly it's using 0.9 and I've heard it's faster in 0.11 but I want to move my funds out of 0.9 before upgrading just incase I screw it up.

That would certainly be possible too but I believe he has published his PGP public key so anyone could verify if it's him or not.
He also has his private alert key so he could send a message over the bitcoin protocol directly to the miners clients if he felt that strongly about it... that's would be vastly more influential and targeted than any email.

@_date: 2015-08-20 10:24:39
In my humble opinion I can't see this ever happening, for one the coins will be valid on both and any transaction happens in both so users will not need to worry about this (as long as blocks aren't saturated).
Imagine there is a hard fork right now where say even 30% of miners (yes I'm being incredibly generous) are supporting an alt bitcoin, who in their right mind would listen to a chain with 30% hashing power compared to the 70% main chain.  For starters this 30% chain would now have confirmation times of 30 minutes rather than 10 minutes until the readjustment... this means the bitcoind chain will almost certainly replace the 30% one within the hour.
xt however won't kickin with new rules until it does have majority of the network using it.  Therefore at this point it becomes the main chain and every other miner would swap before missing out on their future rewards.  At this point it's likely bitcoind would integrate the xt changes as the community has spoken and github's bitcoind core devs wouldn't want to continue working on an inferior alt coin.
I.e. relax and keep calm, either way it'll all resolve itself and coins and transactions are safe either way the ledger adapts.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:12:18
Not sure i follow your question so forgive me if I'm going off at a tangent.
Blockchain usage doesn't directly influence bitcoin price.  If more people are using bitcoin as a currency they'll be more demand for the limited resource so assuming supply remains constant the exchange price will rise until an equilibrium of supply/demand is reached.  'Using blockchain' however may also mean using the chain to store meta data such as how NASDAQ and others are looking into bitcoin's blockchain.  These approaches don't really add any value to bitcoin's coin price since it's the transaction that stores the data not the value of coins being transferred.  I.e. they can make a btc transaction of ~$0.01 and tag that to represent 1,000,000 Apple shares.  What it does do however is expedite other possibilities such as bitcoin being used as a global reserve currency to allow say Apple shares be traded for Samsung shares on another exchange without relying on two nation's arbitrary fiat conversions.
Overstock does talk about bitcoin a lot, guess they're waiting to have something solid before announcing details of their latest project as others are bound to copy them once they launch.

Regarding people who used your site they should understand bitcoin is risky, especially if they aren't controlling the private keys... may feel like shit at the moment but far worse has happened so you'll get through it eventually.
Can you give any details on how it could have happened?
* Was the transfer done via blockchain.info's API?
* Did you get any 2FA warnings?  If not this must mean they had access to the private key somehow.
Any weaknesses that may have existed such as
* Did you use 2FA?
* Did you ever download or backup the private key from blockchain.info?  If so did you use dropbox or any other cloud service.  Where did you store the key?
* Are you running a Windows or linux PC to access blockchain.info?
* Can you see anything from the blockchain.info API log files with your token? (I assume there are log files but been so long since I used it!)
* Was your server on a shared hosting system, VPS or your own box?
* Have you scanned your PC for any malware?
* Do you have TeamViewer or similar installed?

We dont have crank handles anymore for good reason, 
Siegfried Marcus who made the first practical car is a nobody now, has no company, no one knows of him and has no market share. 
Just because we are first doesn’t mean we have it right, screw it up and another coin will become the main one.
Im not advocating large blocks but right now bitcoin needs scaling with low fees to achieve its main purpose of being digital cash.  
It is currently becoming an ever stronger store of value for international settlement, which is fine until something can do digital cash and be scalable at which point bitcoin becomes what fiat is now.
Ethereum is actually looking a serious contender now given they are rapidly developing scalable solutions.
Our 1mb block should be inspiring solutions but instead we are treading water and everyone should be shouting and brainstorming how to solve one of the last major pieces of the puzzle.
Eg LN may work but i think the fees to get on/off are still preventatively high for mass adoption.
Sidechains/treechains may work well but its non trivial to integrate. We need address standards and ways to validate genuine sidechains easily.

That's sort of what an ASIC is but done on a microchip level so will be a vast order of magnitude faster and more efficient.
You also have to keep in mind on an individual asic chip you'd find tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of hashing engines as it's easy to copy/paste on a chip design.

Many countries would pay good money to hire an internal shill like this, hinder a leading nation to set an example and exclude itself from the new resource while the rest get ahead.
By the time they figured out they had been played the other nation's economies who didn't follow suit will be massively prosperous.

When I say bitcoin is still around, I mean given all the negative media articles bitcoin has been mentioned along side of, if this was a centralised entity you can be certain it would have been shut down already.  The fact it hasn't shows the system is more robust than those centralised options before it so if it fails it will be due to a different reason we've not encountered yet.

No worries, welcome to the rabbit hole!
There's a lot to introduce you to in order to answer this correctly.   But in a TL;DR approach, no it's not really possible for bitcoin to become infected due to it being incredibly robust via a positive feedback system.  Even if one persons computer was opened up to do the worst it still couldn't rewrite other people's transactions.. the absolute worst it could do for these miners would be change the address where the new bitcoins were sent to... but by doing this the pool and all contributing miners would probably notice it before they even solved a block.
So only miners actually earn bitcoins for verifying the transactions.  Typically people contribute their mining power to a single pool computer that is running the bitcoind system and publishes any block it finds a solution to.  When that pool computer finds a solution (due to one of the contributing miners finding the solution) the pool can credit itself with 25BTC in that block... that's the rules, that's what the bitcoin protocol is... a set of rules.
That block is now sent around the bitcoin network and people can verify that the block is indeed valid (i.e. they check the transactions too) and if they agree it's valid and that pool did find a solution to the mining problem the block is appended to the end of the blockchain and miners now start building on top of this block.
So to answer your question, a pool's computer could become infected and pay the reward to the hackers address but the pool would know about it pretty much instantly before they even started mining on a block and they'd certainly know about it after finding a block!   This attack vector is not very profitable for a hacker since they could probably only do it once and would be a lot of work!
Infecting miners machines addresses (where the pool will send that miners earnings as a % of their contribution to the pool) can also be infected.  If you look at pool sites people typically type in an address for the pool to send the funds to so this could be modified in the pool's own db system.  Pools are very hardened from constant attack so usually have things like 2 factor authentication required to change a payout address making this again a hard attack vector.
Actually changing the payout address in a mined block is absolutely not possible, for that you'd have to go into how mining works but if you change anything inside that block it invalidates the solution the miners find so if someone tried changing the payout address like that the rest of the network would simply ignore it as it's no longer a valid block.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:45:37
I'm not sure I follow how a market can exist where coins exist in one chain but not the other... if you publish a transaction send coins at address A to B that transaction will be propagated around the network (i.e. both bitcoind and bitcoinxt since they are the same network).
Whilst it would be technically possible to intentionally diverge your coins by double spending during the hardfork's existence this will be a short lived window until the main chain consensus is agreed which I'd argue will be incredibly quickly.
I simply can't see how someone like Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinfloor, BitPay, BitGo, Coinbase, Circle or blockchain.info would possibly adopt a minority chain and risk losing the majority of their clients to competitors who'd continue the practice of following the most secured chain.

MyCelium (iOS) has an annoying bug that in transactions it shows the largest output value as the amount transferred rather than the amount that didn't return to your mycelium wallet.  E.g.

That's the risk with gold, they have to get it to you, you have to know it's not faked tungsten and they have to know you'll transfer the bitcoin on delivery.

You can sort of track them but each transaction usually adds a degree of uncertainty.  This is because you have to use the analogy of bitcoin being nuggets of gold.
I.e. imagine you are buying something that is say 6grams of gold but you have only 3 nuggets each weighing 7grams, 4grams and 3 grams respectively...  Now imagine your 7 gram and 4 gram nuggets were being tracked.
You have two solutions, one is to melt the 7 grams down to create 1 nugget of 6 grams and another 1 gram nugget... Now you can hand over the 6 gram nugget as payment.  In this scenario it's clear to see the 7 gram nugget can be safely tracked to the new recipient and your change.
However if you were to melt your 4 and 3 gram nuggets down to create a 6 and 1 gram to pay it gets trickier since only the 4gram nugget is of interest.  Both the 6 and 1 gram nuggets now have a 'taint analysis' of 4/(4-3)=57%.  I.e. the tracked coins are no longer pure but been mixed with legitimate untracked coins so which one do you follow?
Carry on this process and you can see there is no such thing as a tainted bitcoin since each transaction creates new nuggets that are even more diluted until the idea of a tainted coin makes no sense.
What you can do is work backwards... if you're an exchange for instance you can see if some nuggets have historically been created from tracked coins over a certain taint threshold.  If this is the case, the person depositing the coins probably didn't do it but they can tell you where they got the coins from.  Again that next person may also not be the person of interest but they might be able to say where the transaction was from and so on...
This is incredibly hard investigative work so blanket surveillance is difficult/unlikely the traditional banking system where every non cash transaction can be analysed.  What it means in practice is if a transaction happened that was worth investigative resources at some point in the future someone determined enough with the right warrants can probably find out who made it but generally it's not possible to censor transactions as it just takes one person anywhere in the network to accept a payment that dilutes any taint analysis/blacklist.

Each word is essentially a digit in a base 2000 number system so you have 2000 ^ 24 combinations.

I was more against NY bitlicense than I am now after reading that as was a little OTT... most of those requirements don't sound that crazy for a financial institution to adhere to.  
The only items I think they made a mistake with are the $5k license fee since this is ridiculously to apply per state, per country especially for utilising a protocol.
Innovative new startups who don't know if they'll even make money or not are certain not to gamble $5k investment just to reach one state as the rest of the world is a far bigger place ;)
That $5k is simply guaranteeing all new digital currency startups will happen outside NY which seems bonkers they'd shoot themselves in the foot like this but hey-ho.
They should also make it optional, i.e. a company can become bitlicense compliant and appear as an officially registered business thereby allowing a fee but making it compulsory will help no one.
The other item is the vast amount of paperwork involved for btc companies that aren't even exchanges.
A license as comprehensive as this should probably only apply where the company is withholding a significant amount of clients bitcoin, eg. a MtGox.

For one they can't grasp basic grammar which loses massive credibility.

If it were genuine they'd ask for the EC curve, a public key, message hash and signature. With those items they could return the private key and if they could do that a price tag of hundreds of millions is reasonable.

Yes.  If you're talking about your own machine it's simply time x speed of your machine.  1TH machine finds a block in 197 days it's done 1 x 197  x (24 x 60 x 60) x 10 ^12 hashes to find the a solution.
If you're talking globally you can get a very reasonable approximation based on the difficulty of the network and the speed the bloclks are solved.

I actually heard her response as quite positive, she said it needed safe guards to prevent laundering... well think about how people could possibly do laundering with it currently, it's really difficult already... It would certainly be easier with the banking system at least for large sums of money.  Purchase an asset like a house, sell the house to someone else... job done... this wheeze is one of hundreds recently highlighted in the newspapers recently.
Whilst an estate agent or land registry should report suspicious activity like this most don't want to fill in the paper work so doubt it happens.  An exchange however... well that's their entire job so you can be sure they do it right.
If all she's waiting for are the safeguards to deter laundering using a new system well there's not much more waiting required as you can be sure people will stick with old scams they know to work rather than risk a new one that would probably get them caught.

There is no us and them, this is all open source for anyone do with as they please.
Bitcoin is the strongest by far so inevitably receives the most attention. 
This is a good thing because its like evolution in the digital world, either bitcoin fixes the attack vector or another coin does and would take lead position.
Ie the attacks are making the bitcoin ecosystem safer in a bizarre way because so far each attack has been mitigated.
Bch was probably the most successful attack yet from a psychological angle but even that didnt actually damage bitcoin but made it stronger because more people now invest in bitcoin on any word of a hard fork around the corner.

I think you need to study bitcoin a bit more, so many inaccuracies it's hard to know where to begin...
to help, firstly it's 10 min block times.  
Litecoin has 2.5min blocktimes.  Do you see people using bitcoin or litecoin?  This highlights the blocktime is not that big of an issue.
Next LN only requires confirmations on and off the network, once you're on transactions are instant.  (Actually all bitcoin transactions are near instant, it's just the confirmation time gives certainty that the funds are double spent which is why most people wait for 1 or 2 confirmations before completing a trade).
Finally blocktimes are to give the network time to propogate correctly. If you have 15 seconds it's very easy to have long running contested forks so people will wait for say 50 confirmations before knowing the funds are successfully transferred... this is basically what we have now.
It's good you're highlighting a usecase issue you would like to see solved, just saying shorter block times isn't the solution you're after.

1) Quantum computers do exist, there are even commercial ones like D-Wave which is a semi quantum computer where you can even submit your own code online to it if you academic access.  Yes they are not even remotely close enough for solving something like this yet but they've been shown it is possible in principal so is likely a case of time before one is available at which point all historical transactions with address reuse and still contain funds are now at risk. 
2) When you spend from an address (as bitpay will be) you have to include your public key in the blockchain to redeem the funds.  Until this point the blockchain or anyone does not know your public key, they only know your hashed public key/address hence secure from quantum computers or other such flaws that may be found in elliptic curve mathematics.  
3) You've ignored this one but the K value issue got Sony, got blockchain.info and you can be sure others will fall foul of this.  Avoiding address reuse for wallet providers as a best practice will prevent these sorts of losses from happening.
You seem convinced there is no risk so no skin off my nose if you ignore my friendly advice, personally I'm pretty convinced address reuse should be avoided when given a choice.

@_date: 2015-08-09 09:40:00
Because you have a private key number (x) which is used to derive a public key number (y). The public key number(y) is used to derive your address (z).
Going from x to y and y to z are called trap door processes, ie it's easy to do x to y but the other way (y to x)  is incredibly hard.  
Usually people only know about z and safely share it with anyone.
When you spend money at an address you have to publish the public key (y) on the blockchain for all to see. This makes x potentially vulnerable to future attacks with quantum computers or a weakness found in the x to y step since everyone now knows y and z.
Whilst it's still safe it's considered bad practice because reusing x is not necessary and Bitcoin was designed to use new addresses each time, old addresses can be used but not the intended usage.

No worries, wasn't really related to your original post, just these 'algorithms' that make money never work over long periods of time.  Only people who run scams selling algorithms are guaranteed tomake profits if my point.
I looked into exactly your 50/50 approach before, the catch is you need to decide how much of a +/- % warrants a rebalancing.  If you do it immediately the fees will wipe out your money over time.
If you do it on a 3%+ change it works well but you halve your profits and halve your losses (ignoring trading fees)
You can still lose it all if it drops and never recovers.
When I ran this approach through a few years of historical data my algorithm made less than 50% profit compared to just holding onto it at first.  
Tldr: yes it worked but was less profitable than just holding.

It's a common misconception, one I was guilty of to, but money is very rarely a motivator to excel at anything.
Most people want the most money for the least effort, they excel in what they enjoy and and what they decide to do themselves.
If you give a gift of $100 or $1000 you don't get a better long term result. Actually a surprise free dinner at a restaurant for $100 is vastly more effective at inspiring work than $1000. Clearly that only works a few times but worth keeping in mind. People like treats and novelty

Yes, I really trust people listen to this.  The total bullshit about 2 bitcoin blockchains ever co-existing for more than 100 blocks is just ignorance of what PoW is all about... majority of miners want to mine for bitcoin, not for some alt currency hence whenever a hardfork happens the miners quickly adopt the safest majority client and life carries on.  
Also it's important to point out this only effects how blocks are constructed (at least while blocks aren't constantly saturated).  This means transactions will continue to be possible even if a hardfork occurred and everyone's funds are still just as secure as they have always been.
I.e. Bitcoin was designed for hardforks to allow the safe evolution of the protocol.

Bitpay is fairly safe except from the quantum attack mentioned... Might sound scifi but a few qubits are already modelled and work so is a matter of when not if hence the generalised 'bad practice' warning I believe.
For more current technology, same address use is susceptible to reusing K values when signing thereby revealing the private key on a second transaction. Blockchain.info suffered this flaw for instance.

I believe the minority chain is easy to identify as it's the one with the least PoW.
The two networks don't have to come together, one just becomes unused and disappears.  The transactions made since the start of the hardfork would appear in both chains (assuming someone isn't dicking around trying to intentionally diverge their coins using a feature available in one chain and not the other).

Anyone can run bitcoind if they want, many choose not to as there's not much advantage for average users, that's fine too.  This doesn't change the technology underneath the hood.
I.e. compare it to torrent system, imagine someone doesn't run a torrent but instead emailed a file on it to their friend to post, that doesn't change the fact that torrent is a P2P system.  Same goes for bitcoin's network, someone posts a transaction, all peers on the network can discover that transaction with no central server.
Mining is likely to continue becoming more centralised but the network itself must always be P2P as it can't be anything else.

For the judge: 
Here is the Satoshi test.
To whoever wants to prove they are Satoshi, they simply need to move the funds from an early address with 50BTC in that has not been touched.
For a specific simple challenge, there are 50BTC found at this address [1J6PYEzr4CUoGbnXrELyHszoTSz3wCsCaj]( in block  whoever can send those funds to another address can claim to be Satoshi if they want, without being able to do this they are most likely a liar.
It is unlikely Satoshi, who understands cryptography well, would have lost the early wallet keys.  It is however possible but if he can't do this ask the community to verify his evidence as people are keen to oust any liars.
Please be careful believing Craig's cryptographic proofs, he has shown in the past he knows how to confidently mislead people showing fake signatures, even those who have a good grasp on cryptography were tricked until closer inspection of his convoluted signature proof showed his slight of hand.

A few first impression HCI issues to highlight.
For paying 60cents there is waaaaaaaaay too much security there.  I'd only want to go through that much if spending say $500 worth.  I'm guessing this is just to show all the levels of security there but if not and the card is for general purpose it must have a 'simple' version where literally nothing but tapping the card on a preapproved phone is required.  I.e. you should be able to pay a bill in under 5 seconds to compete with cash, 15 seconds for a credit card.

Good on him learning like this, really getting right into the raw deep end with what looks like never having used a bitcoin wallet before.  Seems a little bit of a harsh intro and would probably have helped if someone had explained what the relationship between "a wallet"-&gt;many "private keys"-&gt; can derive associated "public key"-&gt; to give one "address".
I have to admit he hits the nail on the head around 9min mark of just how vertical the learning is of how bitcoin works and brilliant he says they will create some material to help people better understand it too.
EDIT: I only watched first 10 mins before commenting, at 40mins he has got it and love how he's delving into stats of the blockchain with Mathematica, that looks a seriously powerful tool.   
Btw, his bit of payment to ATM to get USD out, the ATM will show it's own address via QR code of where to send funds to.  When you send your funds to the ATMs address (and it gets confirmed) the cash gets dispensed.  Bitcoin is all about the owner of coins pushing their money rather than the merchant pulling money from an account.  I.e. the ATM will payout as soon as funds are sent to the ATM machine's wallet.

Depends on the wallet you're using to manage your keys.
Most app's seem to have push notifications in so you'd probably receive a notification when funds are being spent since those wallets will be monitoring your addresses.
You can also put watch notifications on your addresses at various wallets so you can receive an email/txt/etc... as soon as the balance at any arbitrary address changes if that helpful to know too.
As for timing, almost instantly... probably talking seconds.

No one in their right mind would buy newly mined coins forged in a weaker bitcoin fork.  Remember the fork doesn't effect transactions as these get entered into both forks anyhow.  That means payment providers/exchanges/traders have an incentive to use the strongest chain (as always).
If they are following the strongest chain it makes newly formed coins in the weaker fork almost worthless (certainly only a tiny fraction of the true bitcoin's value).  If these new weaker coins are worthless the miners can't sustain their mining electricity bills so will either migrate to the stronger chain so they continue earning or eventually go out of business.  Either way it re-enforces the strongest chain will continue and the weaker chain will be orphaned.
I'd expect miners are far more clued up about this than I am so the next time we see a hardfork they'll quickly adopt the strongest chain to avoid literally throwing their money away.
I've yet to hear a compelling reason how a minority chain could exist beyond the 100 blocks cleansing period but happy to be surprised (plus means I could start 5tu coin where I just credit myself a small fortune and offer a less aggressive client change but works with the strongest chain :) )

Ahhh, good point.  Last time I looked a couple of years ago I think it was hard coded list of IPs to try, not sure if it's still this way but would expect to have heard if that was different.
Here are some useful links around the subject though...
The fragmentation is unlikely to be possible though as you only need 1 weak link connection to align the chains... as soon as your node hears about a chain that is longer (i.e. you can see it has more proof of work applied to it) it'll know it's working on the inferior chain and the information spreads like wildfire around the nodes in that cluster so consensus is reached quickly.
If they were somehow isolated and mining, yes a fork would happen until there was a connection made between the two clusters but remember to continue a fork you'd need hashing power on both forks to continue the 10 minute confirmation times(i.e. impossible without vast hardware so this is v theoretical or targeting the large mining pools) .  If that isolated cluster only had say 1% of the hashing power applied to it blocks would take ~1000 minutes to confirm whilst the other chain would still be confirming at just over 10 minute intervals until the readjustment period is reached to recalculate.  I.e. they'd probably have to be isolated from the majority of the network for many weeks/months to even get find a block and they'd be very aware they aren't using the main chain just through common sense.

Not saying your code would suffer from this but if ported to other languages it is a typical nasty bug to watch for in some languages...

From what I can remember the last hardfork was unnoticeable to users, only relevant to miners who didn't want to be mining the weaker chain, I have seen no reason to expect anything different would happen again. 
The hash rate would drop during this period of forking by the % mined of the two chains.  E.g. a chain with 70% of the mining power is going to take approximately 10 minutes / 70% = ~15 minute block confirmation times = ~24 hours for 100 blocks whilst the other chain experiences 30 minute block confirmation times until the readjustment kicks in but yes it's probably going to be decided in less than a day.
I think you're right regarding the FUD that will be spread around when it happens hence why I'm trying to bring some ying to the yang.  There is always an incentive to scare people into selling their coins at times of uncertainty knowing full well bitcoin's price will quickly recover as nothing was broken in the first place and hardforks are actually done safely by design.

It's the first and leading protocol to send actual tangible value over the internet without having to use a bank or private institution to facilitate a transaction.  This allows transactions to be cheaper, faster and more accessible to the world.
Given there is a limited supply of 21 million 'bitcoins' to ever exist it can also be used as a store of value just like any finite resource such as gold, silver or property does.  The advantage it has over these is that there is no storage cost and is accessible anywhere in the world.
Bitcoin balances are stored in a global database where thousands of individuals and companies contribute to determining the single truth database for anyone to access.  It's the most powerful and robust database on the planet costing near $1million in electricity per day to secure.
Bitcoin is a low level service anyone can build on top of to offer services where a store of value or instant global value transfers are advantageous.  This allows for new inventions such as replacing the concept of centralised stockmarkets since a bitcoin can be used to represent a greater value commodity.
Some of the advantages bitcoin offers over previous technologies.
* It is global, anyone with an internet connected device can interact with it
* Funds can only be sent 'to' a bitcoin address, unlike bank accounts and credit cards there is no risk in exposing a bitcoin address to anyone.
* Escrow transactions are possible in that 2 of 3 people for instance need to agree a transaction for it to be authorised.
* No risk of charge backs for merchants
* It allows for micro transactions (i.e. pay 1 cent per minute for something).
* Accounting becomes transparent as anyone can see your past transactions if you show which addresses you own.
* It provides irrefutable proof something happened at a given time as historical records can't be altered.
* Coins can be tagged to represent greater value assets like stocks or shares
* It enables computers to effectively have their own bank accounts enabling far more automation.
There are plenty more but generally these features alone get many people excited about it's possibliities...

Problem is we don't know if the coins were really yours or someone elses they mixed with (more likely) and even if it was confirmed to be yours I believe that market place is a darknet one so unlikely to get anything helpful there.
This approach is probably a 2+2=5 solution as it's incredibly messy navigating that path so would love to hear from others if the final destination of those coins can even be resolved or tips on how to follow coins through tumblers as this keeps coming up.   The approach I used was looking for coins that had 2+ inputs from different transaction outputs found in earlier layers.
The more I think about it the more wrong this probably is but would love to hear if there is a good way to do this.

If you use a wallet where they follow the Hierarchical Deterministic standards like Jaxx, Electrum, Trezor and MyCelium do (or are open source and follow a path you can recreate like Bread or blockchain.info does), it means you can generate and withdraw the funds from the wallet with your seed on another wallet easily.
One thing that isn't obvious is who ensures they are using sufficient entropy in generating new wallet seeds or using safe random values when signing.  For that you need to minimise risk by using open source wallets.

The issue with gold is there are a lot of scams.
I won't buy bars due to tungsten counterfeits or purity altering.
Also the supply isn't well defined plus it's physically difficult to secure snd transport.  Finally the buy/sell spread is high since people tend to use commercial 3rd parties for a degree of trust and they make money from trading, not ownership.
Ie gold is now defunct in my mind since cryptos are a much more elegant form of stored value but guess there's s market for both during our lifetimes.

Bitcoin does not really have many advantages over local currency/credit/debit cards for customers, the benefits are currently more for merchants at the moment (chargeback protection, low fees, instant access to funds, low setup costs).  In time this may well change so customers also get benefits (escrows, safer than creditcard systems, privacy, instant proof of purchase).  Currently however it's a pain to get ahold of bitcoin and it's a lot to grasp that majority of the public doesn't see a point to learning yet.
What bitcoin does lend itself well to currently is international purchases whereby bank fees, long delays and security all suck in the classic banking system.
I'd highly recommend setting up a website that accepts btc... again it may not be high volume sales (and will need to be marketed like you're doing) but you'll be at the forefront as the next wave happens.  Remember when people learn about btc they want to own some and then they'd like to purchase something useful as a test... that's a niche to aim for just there.  
Perhaps you could for instance include a free $5 worth of bitcoin in any bags sold via a paper wallet?  Give instructions on how to redeem it for more bags or do a deal with foldapp and others to cross market it.

I'd like to hear why he thinks SegWit is such a bad thing.  He quotes it like it wasn't part of the original white paper vision but this argument makes no sense... Was CLTV part of the original paper?  We don't see him campaigning to remove those features.  
Segwit saves space and fixes malleability which is a serious bug to address so what is wrong with segwit exactly?
The most likely reason is he's got some vested in bitmain which benefits from asic boost cheat that segwit breaks... genuinely would like to hear him deny this because I'm struggling to understand why someone who has done so much for bitcoin's success would seek to support a weaker chain at the moment.

I would expect the aud-&gt;btc-&gt;gbp advantage is that you could do the transfer almost instantly if you already have accounts setup/find locals or a service to do the btc-&gt;gbp conversion (local bitcoins, bittylicious, Lakebtc?). For that speed you'd probably pay for it in higher fees than a bank currently.
If UK bank accounts allowed business BTC transactions this would certainly be cheaper and faster but currently UK banks have a stranglehold on allowing access to faster payments that cripples usability when exchanging currency.
This may change in time as many banks are becoming more savy to the advantages bitcoin offers.

Yes, janjko is correct.  Transactions are safe as they'd enter both chains (IF bitcoin had a hardfork going on, which it does not right now). 
This storm in a teacup is all about how the blocks of transactions are constructed on the network which only effect miners rewards, it's nothing to do with what is a valid or invalid transaction.
It only becomes about transactions if blocks are constantly full and we're a **long** way away from this so any hardfork is likely to be resolved well before this could be of consideration.

Agreed, litecoin does almost exactly what he describes yet it's still no competitor to bitcoin.  These issues are not issues at all.
IMHO the issues to address are
* Scalability so the network can support &gt;&gt; 3tps.
* Fees.  These are simply too high at the moment.  It is more a commodity than a currency.  This might be fine if a layer2 solution like LN fixes it.
* Fungibility.  It should be easier to erase a coins history to ensure 1 coin worth the same amount as any other coin.  A history associated to a coin may cause valuation issues in the future.  Again LN may fix this.
* Future proofing. We need to start planning for ECDSA being broken and how we smoothly migrate.  This should be possible now and may be fixable with funigibilty at the same time.

MyCelium uses the standards for HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets meaning you can use those same words to access your funds on other wallets like Trezor and the likes...
I suggest mobile phone mainly because there is less chance it is infected with a virus whereby those words are compromised.
If you run windows you have to assume someone is able to RDP to your machine at any time and install keyloggers and other nasty stuff so never keep anything sensitive on it.
For larger amounts use offline wallets or better still hardware wallets for total security.

Whilst I'm not familiar with bitaccess I would have thought you have more than enough to do this.
Typically on an ATM you put your cash in and hold up the receiving address QR barcode on your phone to the ATM (or type in the address manually to the ATM) and ~10 minutes later the bitcoin is now available for you to spend from your phone wallet.

Because many languages like javascript use floating point numbers... they basically have 52bits of precision meaning any whole number can be written with no loss of accuracy from 0 to 2,251,799,813,685,248
This is close to the 
    2,100,000,000,000,000 
satoshi number.
It's not quite 100% the story since there are arbitrary lovely whole numbers used in the mining reward algorithm so you get just less than this but it's pretty darn close to be a co-incidence.
Anyhow as you probably know, in computer science many people use the notation of fixed point numbers and normalisation.
This number essentially gives a normalised fixed point unit expression of global value with perfect accuracy in a double precision float.
I.e. 21,000,000 bitcoin should be thought of as the 1.0 unit of value or 100% global value.
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:22:35
It's a fair question everyone has to ask. 
Centralised versions have existed many times in the past and generally fail due to one of the following...
1) The centralised entity closed down taking all the funds with it.
2) The centralised system was taken down by hackers or govs because it became valuable or competition.
3) The supply of the units was increased/diluted losing trust in the system.
4) It is national based and has no value to people outside of that country.
A decentralised system solves all of these issues hence why bitcoin is still around and most the centralised attempts are not.

Whilst you're right that the users are now distinct roles I still believe it to be very much P2P...
I don't have to mine or even have a node to issue a transaction on the network... you merely need to send a message to reach the network for your transaction to be processed, there are literally thousands of computers I could send it to.  Equally I could run bitcoind with or without the full chain downloading and issue the command myself which makes it very much P2P in my mind.

Not a silly question.  Creating a paper wallet and sending funds to it is easy.  If you do this in 2016 and put in 10 BTC for $7k you're happy and confident it's all safe.
Now fastforward to 2017 and your 10 BTC is now worth $80k.  You want to cash out just $500 you need to move the entire $80k so you will be extra careful.
Firstly you need to make sure you have installed trustworthy software on two separate computers, one online and one offline.  
Now the process goes...
On the online computer generate the transaction in something like bitaddress.org by typing in your source of funds address (paper wallet address) and the destination addresses (change address and spending/hot wallet address).  Make sure you get the fees correctly, you don't want to accidentally put 0 fees because the tx gets stuck for weeks.  Too high and is just frustrating (more times than I dare mention people have put fees of 99% of the tx value by accident!).  
Next you take this transaction and move it over to your airgapped second PC by typing the hex on screen or using a camera (or a USB stick if you're daring).  
Now you sign this transaction on the offline PC by typing in your private key.  Verify the signed transaction is doing what you think it's doing.
Now you move this signed transaction back to an online PC.  Verify the transaction is correct one more time and finally publish it to the bitcoin network.
I.e. this process will take you many hours the first time you do it if you haven't got a second clean PC already setup, it should take you at least an hour with a clean PC setup and familiar with the process but verifying each step.
I'd like to think I'm fairly technically competent and familiar with bitcoin protocol but I did this for a friend the other week and I have to admit I was shaking due to the amount of money he was trusting me with.
If it's in a hardware HD wallet you just don't need to worry about these 'what ifs' and just be confident that the private key remains safe even on a filthy infected online computer, doing a secure tx like this takes seconds rather than hours is my point.
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:00:04
Yes, that's just arbitrage and done all the time. 
The trick is time delays and fees normally have a significant impact (ie bank transfer fees), when it is possible it is normally only for a short period of time as more people do it until the markets equalise.
It's an important part of ensuring bitcoin has the same value globally.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:38:32
This is a global protocol, if you ban it this only bans legitimate uses of it in that country. It will always be available globally, some countries will openly embrace it and gain from its advantages.
Ie the law abiding citizens in a country outlawing it get hindered while the criminals in that country accrue wealth.
Also it opens up cash going overseas where they can use bitcoin. Take the simple example of a ransomware infected machine. If a nation had banned bitcoin but the owner ofthat machine HAD to get their data back, they will pay a premium to the banks and foreign country to pay the bitcoin on their behalf.
Ie banning it merely prevents the country establishing themselves as a player in the global online market.
 
What is more likely an issue is when private banks prevent people in a nation from using bitcoin services, this dramatically holds back a nations economy and involvement while other countries gain market dominance.
Imagine if Google was blocked in America early on because of the telcos stating copyright laws showing others web content on google pages, the Europeans could have easily cornered that market.
This could have been the case if telco providers were European and saw the disruption ahead the internet would bring.

If it's a blip, mostly people able to exchange bitcoin for local currency is still painful.  This is probably the main barrier to entry IMHO.
Next there isn't a clear 'one wallet for them all' approach that simplifies things.   MyCelium seems the leading candidate at the moment but even I'm not certain on how portable it is across multiple devices and if they're backup phrase is a standard or not.  Personally I'd like to see n of M signing happening like green address does to make funds a little more secure (e.g. 1 key on your device(s), a server somewhere else signs with a standard 2nd key and you can put limits on the maximum amount/freq that can be transferred using this common server 2nd key and only use your 3rd key when you control the funds entirely)  This approach would also make instant confirmations viable.  Greenaddress.it seems like they're leading the way on this and would love to recommend them but their UI needs a much TLC before it's a serious candidate.
(Green address your iOS UI needs fixing badly.  Add touch sensor support, remove the pin crap, make the text bigger, simplify it... generally hire a decent UI guy or use bootstrap)
If a massive usage wave were to appear, scalability will become an issue as we're still locked to 1Mb blocks.  I'm pretty sure this is an easy change compared to the easy fiat&lt;-&gt;btc issue though.
If a truly large adoption in daily spending were to happen we probably need sidechains with wallet reference apps and exchanges to spread the load and derisk everything being thrown in the single chain.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:47:22
Because 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis is close to the upper limit that can be described precisely by a 64bit floating point value (53bits mantissa).  Whilst it can go higher this is the number that is approached by using nice round values like 50btc halved every 210,000 blocks/~4 years.

I've not tried but that doesn't seem a vast sum of money?  Perhaps localbitcoin traders can't cope with that but exchanges certainly can.

It's no different that someone holding onto the coins.
1 bitcoin is actually 100,000,000 units.  Using layers on top of bitcoin you can even have fractions of these units too so essentially it is infinitely divisible so there will always be a supply as long as people are trading it.

All love here, welcome to the party!
So yes you've got the jist of it correct... one minor point just to make sure you don't get confused by these small payments to miners... mining is merely a way to provably select a person from around the world to verify the last X minutes of new transactions that happened since the last verification.  X works out to be on average 10 minutes apart by the rules of the network.  Once you have a way to show a truly random person is selected they verify your transaction and every transaction ever done before it.  For doing this work they get to create and award themselves the reward (currently 25 bitcoins) that they can spend in 100 verifications later.  Typically people pool their computing power together much like a lottery syndicate does so they share everyone's winnings in the pool to get a more even/regular payment rather than nothing until they win the 25BTC jackpot themselves.  The payout is usually dependent on how much computing power they contributed to that mining pool.
Before you get suckered into it though, mining is a zero sum game, unless you've already started or have free electricity it's not a way to make money :)
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:09:21
'Master nodes' makes it sound like special servers or something, they're nothing special really, they're simply the bitcoind client running, you can run one too if you'd like.. just download from bitcoin.org/github.
Now whilst you're part of the network so can communicate over the bitcoin P2P network.   Bitcoind also downloads the blockchain from connected nodes by default so you're actually running a 'full node' because you have a full history of all bitcoin transactions. A full node is great for communicating on the network directly without having to use someone elses service and adds a layer of redundancy backup to the network.
If you mine (please don't bother but just saying :)) you're helping produce the 'correct' blockchain by essentially casting your vote for which blocks are valid based on your hashing power.  Typically home users don't even make a dent in the hashing power directly so contribute via pools which are again just bitcoind clients with a layer on top allowing people put their hashing power together to share out the reward payments when a pool wins a block. This helps miners receive more regular smaller payments rather than nothing for ages until finally they hit the jackpot and win a block.
Hard forking typically happens when clients disagree on what makes a valid block, no one wants to work on the minority fork since they're wasting energy for no return so a lot of effort is made by miners to use the most compatible bitcoin protocol (typically the latest bitcoind client). 
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:19:33
That seems a bit of an extreme conclusion :)
Firstly it is still very much a P2P system.  To prove it you can run bitcoind on a laptop computer and now issue commands yourself onto the network.  Mining is becoming centralised but that doesn't change the architecture of the protocol.
Bitcoin was never designed such that everyone would self mine, in fact Satoshi himself even called this out from the beginning that dedicated farms would emerge once GPU mining became mainstream.
As for being relevant to 0.1%, perhaps, time will tell but I buy into the line that bitcoin is merely the protocol to send real value.  It's the applications that utilise it that will go mainstream... i.e. most people won't know or care about bitcoin being used under the hood much like TCP was revolutionary but wasn't very helpful by itself.
Equally TCP couldn't cope with live streaming sessions running on a remote server to be displayed on clients machine so these limitations are taken into consideration and new protocols built on top... i.e. this is why we have HTML/web browsers to navigate websites.
Who knows but I'm still incredibly positive about bitcoin's applications....

They had X bitcoins yesterday, they have X bitcoins today.
Those bitcoins will depreciatein value around 11% this year, 4% each year for the following 4 years and 2% per year for the 4 years after that.
Also talking forex trading Eur/USD yesterday went from 1.12 to 1.11 for $1 = ~1% loss of savings anyhow.
If someone wants to forex day trade to EUR and they bought at the peak yesterday and selling right now they'd lose around 2% of their value... except they could still get more than 60 euro out of the BTM.
Will bitcoin lose more value or gain value compared to EUR?  If anyone knew the answer to that for certain there's significant value to be made either way but right now btc is still growing strongly so know which side of the fence I sit on.

So one approach is if you know the random number used when signing a transaction it is possible to derive the private key instantly.
This is how the PlayStation 3 was cracked (they used a fixed number rather than a random one).
So if someone changes it so this random number is a known algorithm, e.g. a fixed number or perhaps just a timestamp to give some degree of looking random, they merely listen on the bitcoin network for all transactions.  They can do this by changing the wallet code or the RNG the wallet uses at the OS level if a wallet wasn't careful in using more entropy that the OS RNG.  (HW wallets use more than 1 place of entropy and you can view the source code for Trezor online to see how they do this for reassurance!)
They test each one if they can reverse the signature to the private key that generates the matching address.  If they can do this they can now issue a double spend transaction with a higher mining fee and sometimes they will get the money.  (If they get it or not is dependent on if they issue their double spend fast enough and the miner picks the attackers tx up over the original one)
I.e. for this to happen is incredibly unlikely, especially for proven wallets but this is one way it could in theory be done.

It's a good question.  Whilst I don't know the answer, I doubt the v1 software will be smart enough to split it into two transactions as needed (happy to be corrected if I'm wrong) but sounds a sensible optimization that can be added later.
Basically it will improve connectivity and potentially reduce fees so win/win but isn't necessary right now since it could just return saying there is no route possible, Alice needs to establish a payment channel with Charlie to do this tx which now has a channel with 1btc in.
You also have to keep in mind, the chances of you sending more on LN in a single tx than the nodes hold in their channels is probably pretty unlikely to happen in practice.

Yes, all you need is the seeds.  The risk is when you go to use that seed majority of people don't look after that seed correctly.  A few examples of very bad practices Ive seen...
- They took a screenshot of the seed, which was uploaded to iCloud thereby allowing anyone in Apple or access to their account to pull their money out
- They emailed the seed to themselves... Seriously!
- they saved the seed on their computer desktop
- they used the seed on a jailbroken phone
- they gave a copy of the seed to a mate to look after
- they didn't have a backup offsite somewhere safe
Those are the obvious ones, the more obscure security lapses are
They typed the seed in somewhere not thinking about keyloggers.  Not realising malware is likely to target exactly this.
They reused the seed to reclaim things like bcash, not realising the client to may be compromised.
They used a shitty wallet that didn't use deterministic signatures and leaked their private keys.
A hardware wallet is fantastic because it prevents that seed (and private keys) ever leaving the device.  It will only produce a valid tx signature when you physically approve the signing process using the device.  Malware is going to have an incredibly tough time bypassing this security so you can safely use you hardware on the most dirty malware infested windows machine and your funds are still safe.
They are worth every penny if you more than 0.5btc

Free electricity?  Assuming it's not timelimited and maintenance is not an issue I would probably go for the mining route myself since that's a constant return rather than speculating.  I.e. you'll always be earning at least as much as the average price of electricity you consume would cost regardless of bitcoin's exchange value.
If it was time limited or there are other costs associated buying btc is clearly the safer and easier option.
@_date: 2015-08-24 11:50:11
A few obscure cases I can think of:
It can be instant... I could be wrong but I think sending money internationally takes at least 24hrs, usually more (i've had 5 days the last time I tried).  If you need to pay someone instantly bitcoin allows this.  Doing the btc-&gt;local currency should probably be for the receiver to do but it's a hassle at the moment so expect people are looking for services to do this.
Capital controls.  Greece was a good example, if you wanted to get your cash out of or into a country you'd probably find bitcoin helpful for international trade.

I beg to differ.  It involves a level of trust, much like if you purchase a gold ingot or famous painting that you trust the seller isn't ripping you off.
These coin makers swear they remove the private keys, we have to take their word for it.  If they don't and there's a report of even one coin's funds being stolen their entire business model is ruined so unless they're scammers it's in their interest to throw away the private keys so they can grow trust and reputation to grow a business.
This now gives a physical item someone new to bitcoin can hold.  First question they ask is, how can this be used?  It's a great way to get people to learn about digital currencies as they now have something tangible to hold.
It also makes a collectors item and you can see the value of Casascius coins have gone through the roof now we can't buy new. 
Equally if bitcoin ever collapsed (not sure how but let's pretend), the physical coin is still finite and limited so holds value above any raw btc-&gt;local bitcoin exchange price.

That there is why centralised coins will never work. 
"So I heard that a few people used those coins to pay for something illegal time and time again, as prosecutors we need to be shown to have some control on this... let's prosecute the company that runs them."   They should take a note from PayPal as to why they are in seriously hot water issuing and running their own coin.   Even if they make it open source and decentralised, they will need to have control over it otherwise how do they prevent being held liable for making it in the first place, it is a massive financial liability for the company.
There is a very sensible reason why Satoshi disappeared.

A transaction is visible on the network by everyone almost instantly when you transmit it to a node.  For small transactions this is all you need, especially if you know the person or have contact details should it bounce.
Confirmations are like cheques clearing, they're only to prevent double spending of funds.  
It's actually quite difficult to double spend although totally possible hence why people wait for a confirmation if the value is significantly high or there's a good chance someone would attempt a double spend anonymously.
When a miner finds a solution to the mining it is merely a way to ensure someone randomly around the world has been selected to validate the transactions.
If someone has enough mining power they can do more advanced 'undos' of payments.  For each block confirmation the difficulty of rewriting history becomes exponentially more expensive so for high value transactions ($10k+) you may prefer to wait say 6 confirmations = 6x10 = ~60 minutes to be certain the transaction went through and is part of the main ledger everyone is using.
This week (and been solved quickly) I believe there is an issue regarding the potential for a malicious miner to undo transactions deeper into the history due to a bug that has now been solved where some minority miners are using out of date software.   This is why for large transactions people are saying wait for 36 confirmations to be certain the transaction is there until these old version miners update.
This is an oddity due to a change and service of 6 confirmations will return v soon as the miners upgrade to reduce the chance anyone could manipulate it.

You appear to focus on 2fa before the basics... 2fa is important but only later when they're actually using it regularly.
My suggestion, rewrite this to focus on solving their issue first. Ie how to purchase ads for instance. 
After a walk through using some simple site like circle or coinbase start explaining about wallets.
For mobiles say click on  to download a local wallet on your mobile phone where they control the funds. Explain why this is different to a bank account (can only push money, can't be confiscated, available worldwide, finite supply, instant transfers of any value, etc...)
Now explain things like making person to person payments, withdrawing local currency and backing up seeds and 2fa.
Finally do a walk through of Escrow payment as this surely must be of interest as an advantage over cash or credit cards.

To add to the stay away from PHP bit... PHP can be good if you code everything yourself but people tend to use libraries which are full of holes (apparently).
For me I did start with PHP as not heard this advice before and took a few months before the glaring issue popped up of why it sucks... you can't do websockets with PHP and these are pretty much essential for responsive bitcoin applications.  You can fake it up with polling, dodgy PHP libraries that fake it or use another node.js/Java server just for the responsive bits... all in all, was a ball ache and ditched it for node.js.  C/C++ is great for the exe client stuff, wouldn't recommend it for servers as it's hard to hire people to grow it.  Node and Java seems more common backend for servers nowadays in my limited experience... that said people have been scaring me with saying "don't use node" as wel... guess there's no perfect answer but simplicity goes


yet feature/control/security wise goes


so it's a case of striking a balance.
(Btw Python is pretty common for utils/tools and some payment backend stuff too but not sure if it's used on large scale production servers)

a paper wallet is a one trick pony, after you redeem it you need to send the change to a new paper wallet. This has two issues, firstly you need to sign the transaction offline, this is a pita in practice (second computer never having touched the internet with verified software and dependent libraries all installed offline. Most wont be arsed and just put it online to sync so at the very least need to format it all after completing the process which again no one but hardened cryptographers will bother to do), 
ie most wont do that, most will import or sweep the private key using a precompiled exe/app.  If it’s malicious the funds are as good as gone.  Sweeping $1k, ok. Sweeping $100k+... thats just asking for that backdoor to be used.  
Secondly trust the new address for the change is not comprised. Do many really check the sha256 of the files? The latest bitaddress.org didnt match this published hash only recently.
With an hd seed at least all future change addresses are generated safely so you can continue to keep the seed.l even after spending a little.
Each to their own preference, my preference has moved on from paper wallets except for gifts.
I agree an extra password would be a better idea as part of the backup process.

I expect you'll get down voted not because it's 'the dark side' of its history but because btc wasn't designed specifically for Sr and that's an important distinction.  Sr was an early adopter because it needed a payment system outside of banking and whilst it could have used linden dollars, qq, company shares or some internal accounting system, sr developer(s) saw btc offered additional features that would be beneficial (escrow, instant payment, no centralisation, incredibly robust)
These features would be a no brainier to use for merchants if credit cards and PayPal didn't already exist. As these payment systems do exist the advantages Bitcoin offers are subtle and technical but fundamentally disruptive so likely to continue gaining adoption as more learn about it.
Ie tainting bitcoins brand with mentioning historical illicit usage obscures its advantages so is usually a tactic adopted by people paid to discredit and hinder the tech.  
I for one have been involved with Bitcoin for a number of years and never touched Sr.
When sr was dramatically shutdown it made little difference to the price (if memory serves me correctly it actually went up) which also shows sr's usage at that time was an incredibly small part of the ecosystem.
I don't doubt it was originally important for raising awareness early on but Bitcoin was always designed to be vastly bigger than any sort of website.

Congratulations on pioneering an area Bitcoin should excel in!  Would you mind sharing what hosting, server language and DB you use?
Do you use node.js/mongo and therefore have any recommendation on what is considered secure since your generating the transactions?
I'm weighing up a vps vs these automatic scaling systems like Amazon or scalingo.  I'd prefer the managed route but nervous about how secure these are?
Also did you consider adapting bitcoind for publishing the transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:38:09
Without understanding it I'd suggest only investing a small amount like that so that you can get used to it and see how it all works.
There are fees in using bitcoin, the 'free' usage part is no longer accurate with bitcoin, at least until future technology is released that reduces these fees again.  Put simply there is only so much space allocated to store transactions every 10 minutes, the people willing to pay the most will have their transactions accepted and low value transactions take longer to be recorded in the database or simply vanish.  This part is an ugly mess in bitcoin right now because high fees are a fairly recent thing but it will eventually get resolved.  For the moment though, imagine you have to pay $1 or so to do any transaction regardless of amount you're moving.
I'm not going to give trading advice to make more of your local currency, more often than not people doing this lose money because it is just glorified gambling... don't listen to those who say reading charts or any of that other rubbish works, it doesn't.
The point of bitcoin is not to "get rich quick" but more to offer a global currency that is valued everywhere rather than any local currency like euros which is only valuable in Europe.  It is digital so instant to transfer anywhere on the globe and doesn't require a company to facilitate this.  Because there is a finite number of bitcoin that can ever exist it is why it demands a local value, much like how gold has a local value.  (The key difference from gold is it's impossible to fake bitcoin so you'll know it's genuine when you receive it, it's free to store, highly secure and can be transmitted instantly between people)
There's a whole host of differences between a fiat currency like euros, usd, gbp, yen, etc... and ownership of a finite resource.  I'd suggest reading around it all if you're interested because it's a fascinating concept how currencies are valued but if you don't have time to look into this too much just keep in mind that what is more likely to exist in future... everyone has to trust and pay a private institution like banks and mastercard/visa to hold and transfer their money or people would prefer to control their own money they've earned and not have to pay a maintenance fee.
If you see some long term uses in bitcoin you have an opportunity to invest now before it becomes widely adopted.  If you think it's just a fad and banks/payment processing companies is how society wants to work you may prefer not to invest.
Either way putting a small amount in to at least play with it and understand how transactions happen is a great idea, 5/10 euros is nothing to learn a new skill and be more informed than most on what bitcoin actually is and the problems it solves.
@_date: 2015-08-05 19:43:44
Ah, not sure... Have you tried sending the funds as no reason why you can construct the transaction and issue it on the network.  Your balance probably won't change on bitcoincore until it's caught up but I'd expect electrum will spot it immediately.
Alternatively if you see your address in 'electrum received' you could right mouse button on it and click 'send from' and send the funds to one of your electrum addresses this way?  I'm using an old electrum so my apologies if this UI has changed in the latest version.
@_date: 2015-07-02 10:57:50
If he's added them to electrum as watch this is because the funds are managed on another device or they've got paper wallet(s) floating around the house.
If they have a safe I'd look in there, or DVD/CD cases seems a common hiding place for the paper wallets, usually in a plastic bag or laminated for safe storage.
If you got to bitaddress.org this is the most common place to print out paper wallets so you can see what they'll look like.  Typically they are yellow (unencrypted) or blue( encrypted).  Given he has 635BTC you'll probably find he was pretty clued up on the stuff so would expect a blue one and you'll also need to know his password to unencrypt the wallet.
Whatever you do, don't give out any private keys (the ones starting with a 5................. or 6................ ) as with those anyone can take the funds.
Looking at the transactions however they aren't for round numbers in btc or USD so looks like actual spending.
Given the recent transactions are near the end of 2014 it would be good to know the electrum versoin he's using.  My guess is it's a recent version so all those transactions may be done on a Trezor device he's using to store his funds in as that's a lot of money and worth the pricey hardware.
Have a look for something like this... 
Again you'll need his password to get access to it, or you'll need his 12 or 24 set of words seed if you want to bypass his password.
Have you got his mobile phone or is there another computer he could have used for these transactions?
Best of luck with it and sorry for your loss.

blockchain.info 4 digit pin for instance would make me think of your iPhone unlocking pin or a credit card pin.
If you really can't guess it you could try contacting blockchain.info directly as I doubt the iOS wallet is locked down by encrypting with the PIN so they might be able to talk you through how to access it via an iTunes backup.  It's a long shot but may be worth a try.

Ok, allow me to share a few views but these are my own opinions so will let you form your own conclusions...
It does share properties with the USD in that it can be used as a medium of exchange, globally tradeable and used as a store of value by some... but that's where the similarities end.  There are now pros and cons for the different types of currency here.
Let's start with the cons and get them out the way
* The learning curve is currently very steep, especially to the non technical world.
* There is an exchange fee in doing this typically by the exchange you use and 2-3% seems a reasonable rate.
* You have to look after your funds yourself, there is no undo button when using the protocol level.
* It's headlines have historically appeared along side nefarious uses as many of those uses are screaming out for alternatives to the closed banking system.
* It's still in development and things like scalability are still being worked on.
* It's not widely accepted by retailers or people yet.  You generally have to exchange it back to your local currency to pay for goods.
Ok, now the pros.
* The system is a push mechanism... i.e. you can give out your bitcoin address to anyone on the internet and your funds are still 100% secure.  Something bank details and credit cards simply can't do because it requires a full redesign of the banking system.
* Payments at the protocol level are absolute, guaranteed.  No PayPal chargebacks ever!
* Payments are instant from anyone to anyone anywhere in the world.
* It's outside of the banking system, I.e. if Greece had known about it earlier there was no way a 'haircut' would be possible.
* Transfer fees are a few cents for sending any sized transaction.
* It enables new types of transactions like escrow or instantly paying multiple people at once.
* It allows anyone and ANYTHING to own a balance.  I.e. computers can now have their own bank account that not even a human could access.  This enables an entirely new sector of computer science.
* The system is very low level and can be built on.  In future it's unlikely people will be putting many transactions on the blockchain but instead it's a decentralised settlement device when trust is lacking (e.g. bank to bank transfers).
* By remembering the pass phrase of words you can access and spend your bitcoin funds from anywhere in the world.
* Meta data can be included in bitcoin to add to a provable ledger that can't be erased or have it's history modified.  This is incredibly useful for property assignment and proof of when something existed in time.
* It wakes people up to why computer security is important.
* It's the first finite global digital resource that can't be copied but can be owned hence derives a value in every country.
* It's an open platform for anyone to write new financial software with in an area that was previously very closed to the private banks and payment providers.
I was impressed when PayPal first appeared and knew they'd be huge but there was no way to be part of it, Bitcoin is vastly more exciting and it allows anyone to get involved.  Do early adopters get a better deal?  Yes probably, but if it wasn't for the early adopters we'd never have heard about it so the upside for early adoption now has got to be better than say starting to use it in 4 years time.
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:06:28
I'm in Greece right now and no one here has heard of Bitcoin.
That's fair enough and I think Andreas was right that they're not ready for it and Bitcoin is not ready for Greece, at least as far as mainstream adoption.
Some interesting snippets I've picked up here.
* the people here were fully aware of what was about to happen (capital controls) and the people smart enough to get over the mental barrier of why Bitcoin commands a value already got their money out from banks as cash. Bitcoin may be of interest to them but remember euros are accepted worldwide so unless they need to trade internationally there is little issue with euros being used for local trades. Imports/exports will be different (especially when a 4th bailout is being discussed)
* they are incredibly optimistic and think money is important but only so far, the people I've met seem to value family, friendship and way of life far higher than money.  Seems like they've got a healthy outlook on what finance means.
* credit cards are accepted in many places still although cash is clearly preferred.  This surprised me as the bailout has not been signed and capital controls will likely exist for weeks.
* a few I asked seem ambivalent to euros or drachma.. If they exit the euro temporarily or not, they're totally unaware the effects like hyperinflation that will happen crippling their pensioners beyond imagination and think life will just carry on.  Perhaps they're right and I've read too much scaremongering? There appears to be the mentality of the sun rose yesterday, it will rise tomorrow... I don't think most care about government debt problems because they seem remote and the capital controls will be resolved soon. 
* people are under no illusion this bailout is merely kicking the an down the road and issues will occur in winter after tourist season finishes.
* their connectivity here is incredible, really decent speeds on Crete anyhow.  They could adopt a crypto currency here without too much effort. If side chains were on mainline I'd be screaming for a Greek side chain but it's simply way too early.

Bitcoin is still a vast order of magnitude ahead of all of these in terms of usability and adoption however so I'm more interested in sidechain developments.

You have a lot of spam going to that address (Looks like 20,000+) which is probably the issue here.  
If this is serious request I would highly recommend deleting your private key from these posts although it's probably too late.

No, that would cause more adoption which we don't want yet because it's a shitty user experience spending bitcoin right now.

Because the price is what the last match trade between buyer and seller on that exchange was.
Typically they will follow each other closely but because of fees in trades on the exchange and fees/time in moving money from one exchange to another there is always some discrepancy.  If you're fast enough to spot the opportunity you can do 'arbitrage' where you sell bitcoin on one exchange, move the cash to another exchange and buy back more bitcoin on the other exchange (or the other way around).

They were created due to a bug existing in the reference client everyone used, this bug was fixed, universally accepted so the 92 billion false coins were simply removed from existence since it was clearly wrong.
That same issue can't happen again because it was fixed.  Should another bug be discovered that broke the supply rate it would be immediately detectable again and another fix would be applied in the same way.  I.e. this bit is bullet proof as they say ;)
It is also highly unlikely another bug like this exists given it's been 7 years and nothing like this has been discovered since even though the potential reward of a bug like this would make millions.

Theres a place for both, i don’t personally own gold though because I don’t know how to verify what i bought is genuine or goldplated tungsten (or lead spray painted im so bad at gold knowledge).
Selling it isnt easy either, very few people would do a direct trade for gold precisely because its hard to verify it is legitimate.
For those reasons I prefer bitcoin because you cant fake the stuff with a little bit of knowledge.

I love Bread wallet, been recommending it to everyone but it's error handling is needing a lot of TLC.
the last 3 payments I tried making, none have completed.  Rescanning the blockchain doesn't fix it either.  Worse still in the transaction history there is no mention of the transaction so I can't even 'retry' as I don't know that persons address.
Given all 3 were to introduce people to bitcoin it's awkward to explain how it failed and they think I've tried tricking them somehow getting my funds back as they watched me send the money to them.
I can't wait until Bread starts showing 'failed transactions' with a 'retry' option in the history.
The reason all 3 happened is because a data signal/wifi isn't reliable all the time and I expect all 3 failed due to network dropout.
I'd really like them to fix this otherwise I'm going to start recommending another wallet as simplicity is great but if it fails without feedback it's awful first user experience.
Again, want to reiterate I still think bread is the best on iOS and set to be the leading wallet but really really needs this error reporting fixed.

I don't get why people would even apply for this.. whilst 15k is a lot of money for a single research paper we have no idea who else is doing it and what the criteria for success is.
They'd be better saying
* An entry must contain at least X words, Y diagrams and Z sources.
* It must cover at least topics A,B,C (e.g mining, asset ownership, risks, scalability)
From here every unique entry that meets these requirements will receive an equal share of 7,250 euros.  The best entry, as voted for by ???, will receive an additional 7,250 euros.
I for one would love to write this article for them and confident I could cover the topics they're after but I'm not going to invest many days of my time to gamble on the slim chance they pick my submission as the winner.  
If they think it's difficult to write a script to send 100's of payment requests in bitcoin for valid submissions they clearly need more than a research paper to help them understand blockchain tech :)

Because QC aren't totally magical machines.  They can solve many issues vastly faster than a conventional computer but they're not faster at everything.  Hashing for instance they are rubbish at.  Luckily Bitcoin uses a lot of hashing so this is pretty safe for the foreseeable future.
Secondly the ECDSA can only be 'broken' when a private key can be derived from the public key in less time than a block is produced.  Again QC will be able to do this phenomenally quickly but won't be solving in minutes what would take 300 billion years of normal computing power.
In time they may get fast enough to do this, when that happens QC will become mainstream such that signatures or other approaches can be used to make them QC hardened.  For instance to have your tx relayed you have to supply a PoW relating to the public key that would take &gt; 24 hours to compute.  This would allow a safe transition from current bitcoin ecdsa transactions to a QC secure version.
We don't really know how to make asymmetric encryption Quantum proof yet because powerful enough QCs aren't available to the private sector yet.  When this does happen it becomes feasible to ensure an encryption mechanism is found that is QC hardened.

This is great but it is missing a crucial piece of the puzzle, installing electrum on an airgapped PC.  This is non-trivial, I know because I spent a good part of yesterday on it.
It's easy to just forget this advice, connect to the internet to sync but there is a risk, albeit a very tiny one, that offline electrum gets compromised (or the RNG does) and uses some poor R and S values and poof all the bitcoin disappear when you publish the transaction when someone publishes a stealing transaction because they are on the look out for those transactions.
Yes I know it's incredibly unlikely but it's not impossible is my issue.  Cold storage machines should never touch the internet.

Thanks for reply, sounds excellent and glad it's work in progress. As a developer I feel bad that I'm not contributing to bread but so tied up in my own project the thought of reading another code base is rather intimidating not to mention I'm not sure if outsiders are meant to contribute to the dev side?
The other features I'd love to see someday would be 
Scan a pay to address and before sending funds it tells the balance stored at it, so many times I hand out paper wallets and not sure if they've been credited.
Iap but i expect that's apple holding back... Even to 30%+ fee is acceptable to newbies jousting wanting $10 to spend.

For small amounts you'll probably want something immediate like localbitcoins.com or an ATM near you.  There are also immediate exchange places online but it depends on your country as to which one to use so just offering the generic easy way here. 
If you have a mobile phone use MyCelium app or other HD wallet to transfer the coins to.  With the 12 or 24 words given you can safely delete the wallet and later reinstall it with just those 12 / 24 words on any computer anywhere to regain access to your funds.  Doing this step is a great lesson in learning how bitcoin works.

At the risk of being 'that one' I have to say both. Side chains will need to work for this experiment to succeed in scalability otherwise B is the only viable outcome. 
Side chains will allow Bitcoin to be the reserve currency as regular day to day use currencies (eg eurocoin, usdcoin, oilcoin, lsecoin, etc...) become used as blockchains for regular use (ie the side chains have features beyond Bitcoin like instant confirmations, undos, assigning ids, whatever is needed) and can have standardised global value. We are a long way from this however but it certainly looks like it's getting there...

" How can I trust my money if one person can do that? "
From this I've just realised you might not be talking about mining at all but more about general usage of bitcoin.  
Only someone with the private key/password to the address can transfer any value stored in it... miners can only confirm if it's correct or not, they can't change other people's balances or create transactions from other people's addresses.
As for who decides... that's essentially based on which version of the bitcoin rules are being followed by the network.  Anyone can edit the code and publish a change to bitcoin but 50%+ of the bitcoin mining nodes (and major payment/exchange gateways) have to pick up that change for it to be used.
The 'official' master bitcoin reference client in github has only 5 members in it who can release a version... typically everyone follows this because they know what they're doing and earned the trust.  That said, if they decided to up the max coins from 21 million to 42 million I'm pretty sure the 'official' bitcoin client would no longer be the leading version as the miners would simply use either an older version or a new branch no longer controlled by those 5 people.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:23:54

That is true but you'd have to go out of your way to do this so not for the average user.  Equally the window of opportunity only exists during the hardfork being perpetuated... having a hard fork beyond 100 blocks seems incredibly unlikely as there is little incentive to the miners, users or community as a whole to support an alt minority coin.

Python has plenty of stuff for bitcoin development.
Sort of depends what you want to do with it. 
You can use the RPC calls to the bitcoind.exe client to interact with the network from any language if you're wanting direct access.
Alternatively you can use 3rd party REST APIs like BitGo, Blockchain.info and others to quickly do transactions.
You may like to take a peek at which is about programming for bitcoin articles and useful links.
If it helps I started with C/C++, moved to PHP, ditched that and now using Node.js + sql.
Browser stuff just use angular JS.  
Coinb.in is an amazing website to play with blockchain stuff at a lower level than a wallet does.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:30:50
I'm expect this can be done with some blockchain analytics. Those mined coins will probably transfer once after 100 blocks (to the actual miner) if just hoarding otherwise you know they've been purposefully sent to another address. If sent more than 3 times (ie the coinbase pool-&gt;actual miner-&gt;storage like trezor) you can be confident they're in circulation.  There was once a site you could type sql queries in to extract data like this but on my mobile so will let someone else so the honours :)

I don't think I'm confused, pretty sure you can derive the private key number that was multiplied by the generator point to create the public key point on the elliptic curve since it's a minima problem and can be solved using Shor's algorithm (this approach requires around ~2000 cubits however and there are bound to be more efficient ways)... have a quick google and correct me if I'm wrong though?
We can't use quantum computers on hash values however since this isn't a mathematical equation but a series of discrete logic steps... or at least I can't see how a quantum computer could help in these situations so offers a great degree of secondary protection.
If you don't want to believe me about address reuse being dangerous that's fair enough, I'm merely repeating what I learnt as I used to think the same way as you until someone kindly pointed me to the right documents.  
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:34:10
They exploited a validation bug where more coins could be created than were really allowed.  The bug was fixed which would make that block rightly invalid (and any block built on top of it) to anyone who upgrades their bitcoin client.  
Given it was clearly a serious bug that would inflate the currency so much it was a no brainer people adopted the fix.
As for the transactions that were in those now invalid blocks, they'd simply be added to the new blocks being mined automatically.  I.e. no funds were ever lost apart from the buggy 184 billion that were incorrectly credited into the system.  It's worth noting that newly mined coins can't be spent for 100 blocks to allow chain forks like this to be resolved automatically before they can really be spent... Forks happen all the time as a byproduct of how mining works, nothing serious about them.  This bugfix was a hardfork however where people had to choose which chain to follow... it's the same problem for the blocksize however that's not as clear cut which is the preferred path.  Luckily the miners are the ones who pay the cost not adopting the most popular chain so they have an incentive to co-ordinate on upgrading.
Your funds in bitcoin are safe as long as you keep your private key(s) safe, don't reuse addresses and make sure you use a reputable wallet.

The jury is out on Ethereum, it has some great ideas and is pioneering so I tip my hat to them and wish them the best.
IMHO I think Ethereum is too complicated to become a standard (at least at the moment)... Nearly every ambitious R&amp;D project I've seen like this failed because others don't get it and don't want to spend the time learning it.  
If ethereum gets to the point where I can explain how to do something simple to my mother in ethereum I think it stands a good chance of gaining adoption.
I'd also say ethereum isn't really competition to bitcoin but a complementary blockchain... I.e. it's purpose is more about contracts than money.  If they solve the scalability they could well usurp bitcoin as this is the feature people are screaming out for it bitcoin before  a mainstream adoption push.
So no, ethereum is not a failure but until I see it solving a real world problem or trivial to use I wouldn't say it's a success yet either... still R&amp;D

Mining is just a way to make sure that someone around the world is selected at random to verify the ledger and recent transactions in exchange for receiving new coins that enter the ecosystem.

Yes, I agree it is in a bit of a bubble IMHO, the amount of money flowing in is too much for it to gradually flatten out, it looks likely to correct and possibly harshly if people are actually trying to manipulate the launch of the futures soon to appear.
After the correction it will bounce back and gradually hold steady and resume it's organic growth rate until the next major announcement (ETF, Lightning Network, fork/attack issue, exchange being compromised, a national financial crisis).  
 
Overall nothing better than bitcoin has appeared yet so my hunch is it will continue to rise gently over time but yes IMHO we are in a frenzy because everyone is talking about it and lots of people getting involved without understanding why bitcoin is fundamentally different to a stock or share.
The great thing is humans are pretty predictable creatures in a helicopter view, they get get bored within a couple months meaning it becomes less volatile.  What is slightly different this time is more exchanges support more cryptocurrencies so a small percentage of people may cash out to other coins instead of their local currency which may cause boom bust cycles in other cryptos now.

That's very true but I'm still confident this is a bluffing game.

@_date: 2015-07-07 16:53:16
Probably because they are playing the game that if a few selfishly mine like this the system still works and they have a marginally improved chance their block ends up in the main chain compared to a bigger block that takes longer to transfer around the system.
There needs to be a bigger economic incentive to NOT publish rubbish blocks like those... e.g. a head block's replication speed has a delay that's inversely proportional to the size of the block.
Currently it's just annoying that they earn money and not helping the system but isn't anything of concern... yet
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:00:07
Think of side chains as just other alt-coins.
Until one of these side chains is heavily established I'd be surprised wallet developers will use both bitcoin and a sidechain... at least for some time.  It's more likely we'd see something like Bread for ABC chain appears as a separate app for instance.
If you want to get coins on the ABC chain you'll have to buy bitcoin and transfer them to the sidechain via an exchange or the sidechain node/software.
Overall it's too early to say as they've only just been shown to potentially work.

You've imported the private key so electrum is now able to spend funds from 1MN1ooXfkbadpLiYnfeynpibe83NK6LhAJ as well as your bitcoin core wallet.
It's best to always sweep the funds to a new wallet (i.e. send the funds to 179LWczSCcKjWLHB7hQgXFAfku247Qd1p3 using your bitcoin core wallet).
Importing keys is a recipe for problems later as imported keys will not be in your old backup.  Yes it will cost you a few cents but it's worth it for peace of mind.
I've not done it but I expect the first transaction you do in electrum now will try to spend from your imported address and send the change to a new HD address so don't be afraid if it looks like your funds magically disappear from bitcoin core wallet.

Lovely site and yes always interested in src but only out of idol curiosity.
If I could offer some feedback, I would suggest having a typical transaction size shown at the top (is it 288 bytes? ) and what that equates to in USD so it's obvious what the fee rates are.  This satoshi/byte is really confusing for users, basically we have no idea how many bytes a transaction is unless you manually craft it in [coinb.in]( or other such tool.  99% of bitcoin users just want to spend via a wallet and would like to know what the current 'going rate' for tx fees are.
Another enhancement might be a graph of fees over time, mainly out of curiosity on how much this actually fluctuates.
Finally one more bit of interesting thing is if you're able to offer this up as a JS library or something that people can put in their wallets.  Might make a brilliant open source fee estimator others can then use.
Generally though it looks like you've done a lot of work here and is very interesting to see.

By jailbreaking your phone you are removing the safeguards like you say... that means any application can do anything it likes (e.g. stream your screen to another persons computer, record all input (mic/typing/camera)) I.e. your phone is totally open with no security at all.

**'Bumblebees can't fly!'**
Micro payments on bitcoin may be unsustainable at current exchange prices but we now have payment channels that are 0 cost and internal accounting like used in most of the exchanges, again 0 cost which mitigates this... only settlement is required on the blockchain.
Bitcoin is totally sustainable otherwise it wouldn't have lasted 6 years and continue going strong...  If the valuation goes down, miners simply turn off machines to keep the equilibrium balance and the system continues to work beautifully... just like see the bumblebee can indeed fly well.

Absolutely agree just bitcoin only gained momentum since it offered something other systems couldn't.  I believe LTC is unheard of because it offered nothing new beyond being a copy of bitcoin with a few para tweaks... i.e. litecoin could only stand a chance of succeeding if bitcoin succeeded, in which case why bother with ltc?
This dynamic changes if btc is hindered without a scaling solution yet other digital currencies start to offer it.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not pro LTC (although I did buy a little the other week) but I think btc is in dangerous territory in that all scaling efforts are not being accepted yet.
Should a digital currency come along and offer a vialble scaling solution it is likely to gain momentum very quickly and may well overtake bitcoin's leading position if the miners insist on not adapting.
I personally believe this is the safest option since modifying btc to have segwit does make me nervous, I'd love to see it on another network first to make sure it's robust.

Dont use an online web wallet, download an app for your phone is probably best (Bread wallet, mycelium, jaxx, copay are good HD wallets).
If on a computer you may prefer to use Electrum.  All of these are called SPV wallets in that you don't need to have the full blockchain locally but at least you control the keys.
Next the receive address will change every time you request a new one (or at least it should change each time you've had money sent to a received address).
It's a security feature and nothing to be concerned about.
Bitcoin uses vast numbers, numbers so big it boggles the mind when you first read about it.

TLDR but I think they are right... if you have a choice between a two paper currencies...
1. This requires you to write down your mobile number on each note you receive.  You can only transfer the note to someone else when you've written your mobile number down.
2. You pass the note to someone else and they now own it.
Given the choice which one will people prefer?  Clearly  has the major issue that should in future that note be involved in say a crime, authorities may want to call up the people earlier on that note to find out what transaction they did with the person involved in the crime.  This could go 2 or 3 levels deep.
It also means when you hand the note over you're trusting the next person to write their number down as ownership otherwise your phone number might be the one associated at the crime scene so they ask you for the information of where you spent it.
Now this isn't a perfect analogy of what is happening with bitcoin because firstly it's not quite as identifyable, secondly people committing crimes using bitcoin would be stupid these days BUT there are stupid criminals out there and it is usually identifiable through this process of reverse investigating so is an issue to address.
So as a currency user you'd prefer not to have to worry about the note's history or future when doing trade, this is the reason fungibility is important in an ultimate currency and why these others are getting traction.
Luckily LN and CT both address this shortcoming in bitcoin but until they exist you can see why these other currencies may be more appealing to the nervous user when given a choice.

Txs are almost instantly, the confirmation is only necessary if they don't want to risk a chargeback during that 10min (eg a TV sale with no ID). Given a CC confirmation time is 6 months I wouldn't be surprised if shops accepted 0 confirmation txs.
Now I know it's not quite the same because the laws around double spends will be a grey area whilst people get used to it and users learn a double spend will be considered a crime but  guess that just takes time.
As for volatility, for a shop with regular sales it's less significant since the volatility averages out over many purchases.  As long as the value of btc continues its upward trend over the last 7 years the shops will probably be quite pleased I expect.

Trezor is excellent and well worth it for large store of value.
Alternatives are
- paper / steel wallets

Make sure the exchange doesn't keep the Bitcoin.
Perhaps a payment channel approach?
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:28:11
Here are some thoughts in case it helps.  Generally well written even though I may disagree with your conclusion ;)
"The Bitcoin community hopes that because of the deflationary pressures, the value of Bitcoin will increase until the next halving event and keep mining profitable"
That's not actually accurate.  it's a positive feedback system, if the price of bitcoin drops or the supply reduces due to halving, or electricity goes up... it simply means it's not profitable for miners so some will drop out and turn off their hardware.  At this point mining gets easier and profitable again until the equilibrium is reached once more.  I.e. it's by design that mining is only barely profitable on average.
"A medium of exchange should have a constant intrinsic value and a stable purchasing power"
Are you seriously saying that the GBP is not a currency?  You know it dropped 10% in a day last year?  Pretty sure it's still considered a strong currency.
"Moreover, a big disadvantage of accepting Bitcoin payments is a minimum 10 minute waiting time until a conrmation is cleared."
This is only if you want to wait for a confirmation.  In LN and multisig setups this wait is not necessary.  Equally a confirmation is the same as the 6 month confirmation time for credit cards, the difference is people wouldn't consider waiting 6 months for a confirmation hence trust the other party to a small degree unless it's a substantial purchase like a car in which case they may also ask for a contract to be signed or done with a 3rd party involved like a bank... the exact same thing is true for bitcoin.  The difference is with bitcoin we have an opportunity of removing even this 10 min wait confirming time too.
"Bitcoin serves as the best store of value for individuals who are lookingfor  an  unregulated  and  relatively  anonymous  store  of  wealth"
I'm afraid I have to totally disagree with this from my own experience and many of my technical friends.  Anyone who has put savings into Bitcoin has seen their store of value increase generally and I know a lot of people investing in bitcoin simply because it's got a vastly better track record than any other currency.
I believe it has been shown to be the best performing currency in the world 7 out of the 8 years into the experiment, that should speak volumes on why people do this for legitimate law abiding reasons.  The tricky part is investors can't get easy access to it or are scared by the unknowns and haven't researched it because they don't want to or don't have the time.
"dsicusse"  should be discussed I expect?
"Currently, the biggest weakness is the blocksize  limit  of  1MB. "
This is not a weakness at all, it allows for decentralisation and is encouraging Layer2 protocols to be built now rather than when it's frantically trying to cope with a surge in demand.
Bitcoin is an experiment and a solid basis for future technology built on top of it so would strongly question the word 'weakness'.  Perhaps consider 'constraint' or at a push 'limit' is a more correct explaination.
"The biggest obstacle preventing Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to other fiat currencies is its volatility."
There are many fiats out there with worse volatility than bitcoin so not sure this argument holds up.
Equally you've shown that volatility is decreasing and additional financial tools such as margin trading further reduce volatility which directly contradicts this conclusion.
" it will reach the volatility levels of fiat currencies approximately in 2019-2020"
I disagree about this volatility argument, but I do agree in the 2020 timeline mainly because the next halving will put bitcoin's inflation rate below most western countries.
At this point it becomes less of a speculative asset to appreciate and more a reasonable store of value that out performs a bank account.
The main 3 items preventing bitcoin replacing a fiat right now are
1) Inflation rate is above US/China/Most of Europe.
2) It is only viable for mass adoption when Layer2 technologies are available.  Currently it could only replace a settlement layer such as being part of a global reserve currency.
3) A fiat currency is a key part of a nation, this is not going to be relinquished.  Bitcoin is more likely to become a global reserve currency on it's current path than a direct competitor to a working fiat.

As a developer who is after a system capable of vast microtransactions AND a store of value, would I pick bitcoin that only offers one of these features or an enhanced version of bitcoin (litecoin) that does both.
If litecoin gets segwit and a solid LN implementation  and bitcoin is held back, litecoin could become the standard 'good money' and gradually push our the weaker version. 
I'm still optimistic bitcoin will get segwit/scaling solution but if it doesn't it almost certainly lose its top place.
Ie This isn't about loyalty or a pump/dump, it's about evolution of crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:21:20
58% and requires 75% for activation.
The cryptocurrency that enables fungible micropayments at low fees backed by a finite decentralised digital resource is going to be the dominant global currency everyone uses.
I.e. Another currency, litecoin or otherwise, that does allow for LN or other vastly scalable solutions to easily exist  is a very real and serious threat to Bitcoin remaining the dominant currency.
Keep in mind Litecoin is just Bitcoin with a different mining algorithm and different chain.  It's not difficult to repurpose code to work with litecoin. 
With Jaxx and Shapeshift transferring value from BTC to LTC chain is rather frictionless too. 
Seriously want the bitcoin miners to pay attention to this because we all want to see it remain the strongest chain.

SW fixes a number of bitcoin's major problems.
Firstly malleability.  For developers I can tell you this is a real bitch and is incredible we are still battling it.
Secondly, future upgrades become viable.  Adding new instructions in becomes possible without a contentious hard fork each time.  Heck even versioning is possible I believe.
Yes LTC doesn't need segwit for LN for scaling yet but LTC is BTC just cloned with a few param changes... there was never any reason before to use LTC over BTC.  If the innovation starts happening on LTC people will swap to the better chain.
I'm indifferent over which coin succeeds although I've been only backing btc all these years but if LTC fixes malleability and BTC doesn't, I'll be swapping our system to LTC because of that feature alone.  (Shapeshift is going to do rather well in the coming months at a guess).

Pruning + checkpoints.
At the moment pruning should be enough, after that check points can be added easily enough.
No one needs the entire blockchain, we just need enough of it to be sure it's the correct chain.  I'm sure a few enthusiasts and corporations will have a few Tb free to continue to store the full chain in the decades to come but I don't expect that to be the norm when our kids start running nodes.
That said, I share your view that I'd like to see the blockchain bloat removed sooner rather than later as it's non-trivial to get bitcoind running these days.  You need the right chipset, enough HD space, enough BW etc... it's not something you can repurpose that crappy old 2007 mac for ;)

You'll be right if bitcoin adopts segwit, if it doesn't I can't see how bitcoin could ever be used by the masses. 7tx/s isn't going to be even close to making a meaningful payment system.
Litecoin is bitcoin with different parameters... If that can scale by having LN and fixed malleability it's a better chain people will inevitably using more of. 
I'm holding fast on ₿ as our backend at the moment but if nothing changes in 3 months we will most likely migrate to Ltc denomination because that would have a brighter future.
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:38:09
Agreed but and i didnt have litecoin until about 3 hours ago because i never saw it having any significant usp but if it gets segwit that changes.
Bitcoin's stagnant approach to scalability makes it a weakness...  
if we are lucky the miners will react positively to this and see importance of segwit/Maleability fixes and LN support. 
Its just evolution in a digital space.

Their patent is only valid in China.
I believe I am using common sense, I want to verify the assertions because a UASF is an incredibly dangerous move, it bypasses the fundamental  security protocol of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-04-05 14:08:40
Why do you think we need a blocksize limit increase?  I mean with LN and other 2nd layer approaches with small blocks means the chain is only used when absolutely necessary.
Picking 1Mb/2Mb/10Mb/100Mb is an arbitrary limit until it starts becoming unworkable at which point we need to engineer around it.  May as well start at the 1Mb limit until we know a rise is absolutely needed... right now the increase isn't needed because people are still easily using the network and we haven't even released a layer2 solution yet.
I'm not against a rise in future at all, but doing a hard fork now just seems unnecessary is all I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:41:59
Am I the only one concerned about this? The user experience for general consumer use is awful right now( long confirmation time, lack of scalability yet, little feedback about fee pricing, lack of Escrow wallets for consumer safety) , we need the layer 2 stuff before a mass adoption push otherwise people may get put off the idea.  I know these features will come but they are not ready yet... Just seems too early for anyone (pushing) this sort of project.
Or am I needlessly concerned?

Keep in mind that Bitcoin payments are nearly instant, it's the confirmation times that can take a while.  You can still spend unconfirmed transactions, merely you risk a chargeback during that time.. much like spending money you've received from paypal within 6 months.

Apple and Google are going to eat them alive if they think this simple virtual money approach has legs.  
Allow me to fast forward 5 years to that phone call.
"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  The board has decided we no longer allow future apps in our store to use your integration on our hardware.  I'm really sorry about that but given you've had some success with it we've decided to launch our own credits system and having multiple options will be just confusing to our consumers."
I tip my hat to Visa for trying something new but they must know mobile payments are going to decimate their card industry and the bitcoin protocol is potentially going to replace their payment network.  They should be looking at how to embrace this and use their brand to offer customer assurance in using the new protocols... someone's going to do it and Visa is well placed to do something disruptive if they wanted to fight for leading the market.

Just use an HD wallet where you remember the 12 words it gives you.  Mycelium and copay wallets do this on mobile or electrum on pc/Mac.

I agree it's harsh but ultimately you're asking for problems with this service.  If funds get stolen from someone's machine, who had access to it?  You're inviting risk without any upside.
You can tweak your model such that the node is just that, a bitcoin node and users point their SPV wallet towards it, that would probably be appealing and means low risk to the user since you don't have access to their keys.
TBH, bitcoind needs to change this to be the default behaviour and split out the wallet and node parts.
@_date: 2016-02-26 09:31:02
I would expect you could use blockchain.info to import your wallet.dat file and move your funds to a thin client like Bread/Mycelium or directly to a paper wallet.  I've not tried their service before but I believe that is precisely what it is for.  
If we're talking a lot of money where you can't take any security risks, backup the file, grab the latest client, do a full sync and import your wallet is the safest way.

Firstly "The Blockchain" = bitcoin, let's not use that marketing crap here as this is ;)
Order of things to solve IMHO...
* Enable a scalable solution ontop of bitcoin for mass market transactions.  LN, sidechains, treechains, paypal, something else, etc..  That is absolutely necessary to nail while bitcoin is still relatively tiny and people have an "whatever" attitude towards it.   Mass adoption now would be horrific user experience in the boom/bust cycles, it simply isn't ready for people buying coffees daily with it yet.  (It is ready for layers on top and settlement)
* Simplify the on/off ramps to local currency.  Companies like Plutus are going to lead the way on this by the looks of it.
* Simplify the usage, services that abstract the complexities of confirmation times, multisig and addresses as most users don't want to be scared by new things... they just want it to work with minimal fuss.
* Start showing the good bitcoin can do.  Humanitarian aid, helping during a financial mess, autonomous agents, trade with Africa... i.e. highlight the positive enabling effects so people see it's benefits.
* Trading of bitcoin as a commodity on markets.
* Start seeing products appear that can only be obtained with bitcoin.    E.g. it becomes a requirement for people to have some to obtain these services.  
* Corporates jump on board to obtain the benefits in using internet money.
* International trade starts becoming denominated in btc as it's agnostic of country.
Who knows if it'll pan out like that but that's my crystal ball for the next 10 years.

Sorry that questionnaire is painful.  It's confusing with so many parameters to consider and little coherency.
You'd need to pay me to do that survey ;)
You're clearly trying to determine what type of blockchain will solve what problem... I can sum up my opinion far easier for you.
You'll find 'blockchain' is just a buzz word and been around for a long time, it's just a shitty linklist database.  If it's not decentralised, not anonymous, it won't get used because SQL and no-sql db's with trusted 3rd parties is far faster and vastly more powerful and more elegant to use.
Only one blockchain really needs to exist and that chain will be the one with the most decentralised energy spent on it to serve it's purpose.  Generally that purpose is proof of transaction at a certain fee.
Currently bitcoin is the strongest chain and works because it's designed for that.
Namecoin should work and works with bitcoin's mining but again namesquatting and lack of private institution incentives seems to have hindered that project.
Ethereum 'may' have a usecase in automated contracts but again most people get into this seem to migrate to private chains due to concern about future compatibility, risk of horrendous bugs in contracts or scalability issues.   Time will tell and I'm sure it will be around for a while yet.
There is very very little use for a private backed blockchain and I've yet to see a use-case beyond bitcoin that works.  *Most* fintech companies I work with here are focused on bitcoin and have ditched 'blockchain' crap now.

Mycelium... didn't realise this was an actual word until now.  The AutoFwd helper is merely there for simplicity as anyone new to it won't know what a good wallet is... starting with bitcoind is possibly the scariest introduction to bitcoin (e.g. wait 8 days for blockchain download before you can use it) hence the link finds the easiest wallet to use where at least you have your private key and can access it immediately.  
Whilst I know links are frowned upon by those who are into security, you have to trust someone somewhere when downloading software unless you're compiling it yourself.  At least the autofwd link only takes you to the appstore(s) or other wallet website, it doesn't download any software for people.  I.e. it's no different than having wallets listed on bitcoin.org and trusting those people.
As people start understanding it they'll be able to make their own mind about wallets and google probably now becomes their trusted source.

This is such a venomous statement.
The people using the system miners are securing gives it value, miners make the system, not employees... the users cannot sack, control or discipline miners, anyone thinking otherwise is utterly misguided.
I may  not agree with the lack of segwit support but it's my hard shit.  
If users don't agree with the miners they simply sell their coins and buy into a chain they do..
As soon as another coin supports scalability you can see bitcoin value drop until it is supported or becomes the MySpace needed to build the Facebook.

. If someone thinks it's useless they're clearly not a developer who would immediately understand the importance of fixing malleability. Segwit isn't all about scalability.
If malleability is fixed in another chain and not bitcoin many developers are likely to start adopting the more secure bitcoin system which is about to become litecoin.
Equally to swap from ₿ to Ltc is pretty darn easy for sites given its 99% the same protocol and uses an identical api.

If you have funds on copay move them to another wallet, destroy your original copay wallet and optionally create a new copay one or use another wallet provider.
I'd highly recommend a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger if you're storing anything more than $200.
Copay should be fine to continue to use if you recreate it with the latest version.  The problem is an old wallet should be considered compromised as the malicious code had access to that seed.

I expect they'd be short sighted to create a sovereign digital currency backed by a country with debt.
A global currency, currently bitcoin, would offer a good degree of protection against devaluation since it has value everywhere.
Before this is even conceivable beyond the wealthy elite, the scalability layer needs to be added so it can be used for day to day usage.  It's coming but we're still a number of years away from when it's appropriate to suggest such an idea.
That said, having Greece accept btc for settling imports/exports could certainly work already... if it proves popular payment channels provided by new import/export digital trading companies could be established allowing vast sums to be transferred at almost no cost.

Yes, most likely... but you probably won't buy during the dip because you'll be thinking "Its crashing" at which point it bounces back and historically goes higher again.
Only safe way I know of buying into btc is buying small amounts regularly to iron out any volatility risk.  Sometimes you'll get lucky buying low, sometimes high but overall you'll get the avg price and if btc is generally appreciating in value your value will have appreciated too.
Saying 'now is a good time' to go all in is just random guessing IMHO.

Firstly remain calm, your funds are likely to be fine.
Breadwallet seems to sometimes get confused on what is change and what is the transaction.  Could the change explain the double amount you're seeing?
You may have also been hit with a transaction malleability issue from someone being a pest on the network that disrupts older wallets.  It would probably be worth confirming the version of bread wallet your using.  Either way your funds will still be safe, it just might take some time for your wallet to figure out if the funds were sent or not.
My guess is they will be and you'll see your change appear in breadwallet eventually and coinbase will receive the funds.
If you can share the transaction ID number here people can look into what's going on for you (It's perfectly safe to share your txID and/or source/destination bitcoin addresses).

I've never owned Litecoin until yesterday and today I've bought more so half my btc value is now in ltc because I see LN as the only viable long term solution.

So when you create a transaction of spending say "0.1btc from address A sent to address B".
You sign this transaction with the private key of A such that no one can change it.
That transaction is hashed in such a way that it produces a single number which is the txid.
Now the problem is using some clever tricks you can modify that transaction such that it's still valid, still sends 0.1btc from A to B HOWEVER when you hash this modified transaction you get a different txid.
For instance, a signature has a value and it can be thought of as both a positive and a negative value are both identically valid signatures.    The problem is though if you swap S for -S, when you got to hash the transaction again you'll now have a different txid!
So why is this so bad?  I mean the tx will still confirm, the funds will still go from A to B, how can this cause a hack?
Well put simply, tracking transactions is easiest done by the txid.  You create your transaction, publish it on the bitcoin network, wait until you see your txid included in a block.
Now what happened in the hack is that when the funds were withdrawn, someone did a malleability attack on the withdrawal tx.  MtGox believed the tx they sent never made it onto the network for whatever reason so would issue the tx again.  The hacker could do the same process again and again, essentially having a 50% chance of getting double their money out each time.  They could therefore deposit 100btc in, withdraw 100btc, do the maleability attack and 50% of the time would get 100btc + any reissued btc txs.
Now that +/- signature issue is fixed but there are many others still lurking out there.
Without maleability fix it's difficult for services to be confident their transactions actually went through, it's possibly the most serious bug in bitcoin that must be fixed because it's almost inevitable the hacks will happen again.
(To this date I'm not sure how someone is supposed to prevent this other than get a human involved each time a transaction fails to complete).

Perhaps, I fully expect if LTC gets SegWit it will apply pressure on BTC miners to adopt it but looks like it will be slow adoption.  Until BTC does adopt SegWit however it seems reasonable LTC will continue rising in value as more users swap some value to another chain with less centralised mining, cheaper fees but most importantly a working implementation capable of handling millions of concurrent users via LN.
I'm not trying to pump it and not recommending you buy any, it is very speculative and I may very well regret it.  Just saying I did buy LTC yesterday and today and I'd normally never touch alt-coins because I very much believe only one chain will be dominant for the store of value.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:29:19
Keeping some eggs in another basket but you're right bitcoin could lose market dominance if LN appears on another bitcoin clone and btc doesn't support it.

Where could you buy coffee with bitcoin 10 years ago?  Just because it's the main chain now is bizarre to think it would remain that way if something far better comes along.
What people seem to be overlooking is that bitcoin has done incredibly well and now encountering the issue where it is either settlement or a payment network.  
The status-quo is it's settlement... buying coffee isn't sensible with it.  It needs LN or another such layer to allow that but there is a fundamental design flaw in bitcoin preventing this.  The miners aren't bothered because they thing it's all peachy, the problem is some people will want to buy coffee with it.  Those people will be therefore keen to support an ecosystem where it's capable of doing this.  As those people are forced to use another chain like LTC the value of that chain appreciates.  If it gains enough momenteum, why would people both returning to bitcoin if they can have store of value in another chain AND it's appreciating faster than btc because it's more usable.
That's my point... I don't know which is going to be around in 5 years, but btc is stuck right now and is vulnerable to a better chain appearing.  I'm not fussed if it is settlement or not, just pointing out the facts.  My hunch is btc will remain the leader but another coin will experience rapid growth now btc is saturated with no future growth plans.
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:56:57
No on so many levels...
"Typically, well above-average returns are promised on the original investment"
There is no such promise with bitcoin, in fact it's known to have ups and downs.  Generally the trend continues up year on year which is why people get surprised and call it a ponzi.
All transactions are open and you can trade directly goods for bitcoin if necessary.  There is no company, organisation or individual in control and you can transfer your coins to anyone at anytime knowing it can't be stopped.

From a marketing point of view perhaps they should get these systems in some high profile places to demonstrate the full node is just as capable as a highend PC... that would inspire many just to buy their HW setup rather than making their own bitcoin node.

I was under the impression deflation implies the value of a currency goes up.. Inflation whilst bad for general fiat savings is normally seen as good for an economy as it encourages people to spend rather than hoard.   
This works well until you have banks no longer lending yet capable of keeping this new money thereby making their investors richer faster than the general population.  Now we get this daft 1% own more than 99% issue which is just sickening in terms of humanity.
The conundrum is banks have more influence than an elected gov since the population believes their bank balance is equal to those paper notes.
Just like those notes were debased from gold/silver in the 70s, it appears the banks together have effectively debased fiats.  This wouldn't be an issue if those banks were honest entities trying to do what is best for society but they are private companies trying to maximise profits.  
Who knows the answer but something is likely to give as more people realise how unscrupulous banks are.  Now the world has the free financial technology not needing private banks involvement it will be interesting to see how it plays out.

Well said and agreed.  As Bitcoin becomes better understood and more people recognise its value I fully expect its value to stabilise but we're probably decades away from that.

You're right but what happens when people put no fee so the tx never goes through and eventually dropped from mempools?  The consumer is frustrated they can't cancel it for weeks, the shop is frustrated because they never get the payment yet lost their goods with no contact details to follow up on.
The only way this system will work right now is if they piggy back on Visa/MC payment system, at least until the layer 2 tech is ready for deployment.

Wasn't intended to be patronizing, just saying you're making some claim like you know what is best for everyone but from your statement of 1 year in and a reddit account with 0 credibility you seem to think your view should replace the years of engineering that have gone before it.
From my perspective trying to modify how bitcoin works because a mob disagrees with it is just stupid.  That 'chinese miner' has the ambition of earning as much as possible by enforcing the bitcoin rules thereby keeping it valuable.  I'm not surprised they don't want to change it... ever heard of the bird in the hand expression?
Bitcoin is what bitcoin is, not run by some meglomaniac chinese miner... it is run by the people who support and use it to give it value.  The miners get rich from these people using it.  If you swap PoW those miners will swap PoW too... problem is not solved but risk is added since YOU might be the malicious actor here (I guessing you're not but just saying it is more likely than some chinese miner who's invested a fortune and just enforcing what the concensus rules are)
If it's going the wrong way, exchange your btc for another coin that does what you're after.  I'm still long bitcoin but watching for the first coin with bitcoin's features PLUS a working vastly scalable layer 2 solution.  If that happens on another coin I'll not be crying for a pow change, I'll just change my coin and get them cheap while less technical people figure out what the heck is going on.
Guess I'm just trying to say, keep an open mind.  10 years ago bitcoin didn't exist and was released as an experiment.  If someone builds on it's shoulders and solves fungibility, scalability and simplicity... well why would I continue support btc if it was stuck in btc, it's a very simple swap with 0 risk to bitcoin.

You can use check lock time verify to create an address where the funds held there can't be spent until a certain date.
Visit   and create a new public/private key. (Probably worth using something like your surname as the password to protect it too)
This will give you an address like 
    1MbnozGLemPemNkZnHncqLd2PAUDMHzLsD  
and public/private keys of 
public key: 
    03df2089ad5905be5269cfa4e6bf56c03b86034c6d5545904522756fee95128d58
private key: 
    Kx1VU6B44VzVzy6pLbaRiDyMCW5sbXigJDENveJuK1j4KB3FVmWY
Next visit  
And type in that public key you generated (03df20.... in this example)
Now set the date that those funds become spendable (This example is set for tomorrow at 12:00) and finally generate the CLTV address.
In this example I get
    3P346v2b5Rg5eGdQ8wPkhp6pKZfSYH3gM6
and a redeemable script 
    0470260159b1752103df2089ad5905be5269cfa4e6bf56c03b86034c6d5545904522756fee95128d58ac
Now you can send your funds to this address 3P346v2b5Rg5eGdQ8wPkhp6pKZfSYH3gM6.  
After the date anyone can broadcast that transaction  (04702....58ac)  using any bitcoin site such as here...  
That transaction will send the funds held at 3P346v2b5Rg5eGdQ8wPkhp6pKZfSYH3gM6 to address 1MbnozGLemPemNkZnHncqLd2PAUDMHzLsD where you have given the private key to your loved ones meaning they can sweep/spend those funds anytime after the date you've specified.
(Please note I've not actually done this myself yet so will let other chime in if I've overlooked something and I would highly recommend testing with say 0.01btc first to check it works as you expect. Please also share your findings because I'm interested in how you find the process.)

I tend to agree with you... all too often in time constraints do people get moved to other products.  
It didn't seem like a permanent 'brick it' sort of attack vector so any supposed attack would be short lived and a one shot emergency destroying credibility.
My only concern is if this was overlooked is there something even more malicious there.  Has anyone tried compiling the source to see if it matches the shipped binaries for instance.
Putting a kill switch in is one thing but if it somehow performed say their hashes using your electricity I'd expect that to be a more likely malicious scenario.  E.g. you get a machine saying it does 10TH but actually does 20TH and uses half the advertised TH/J power.  Now bitmain would not need a data center to have vast power since other people are paying for the electricity.
Clearly this would be very hard to disguise and need a lot of communication with their server so seems very unlikely but if they were malicious this is what I'd have expected to be done hence I think their kill switch is benign.

Whilst I fully agree with you, the question is more one of if you have a segwit address which has funds in, how do you prove to others that you have access to those funds cryptographically.
Doing a bit of digging we can actually go from legacy bitcoin address to segwit address via this...
So the current process seems to be 
* Get the private key for your funds
* Sign a message like "These are my funds" using that private key
* This will produce a signature that can be verified for the legacy address.  
* The person wanting to publish proof can now post this signature and the legacy address it relates to
* The verifier can now check this segwit address is indeed controlled by the claimant by converting the legacy address supplied to the segwit address.  This segwit address should match the owners claiming address.
* The verifier now also verifies that the signature is indeed related to that legacy address.
Basically this is an ugly unusable process now that I'd be surprised will ever be used in practice.  We need to produce a simple html/js tool to allow segwit addresses, signatures and text to be easily verified.  
E.g. something like this...
Or perhaps built into the API for bitcoind  (forgive me if it does exist, I haven't actually looked but based on others feedback this appears to be missing)

It's probably because bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream until these problems are solved so no one is in a rush to simplify the terminology yet.
It essentially all rotates around 'How can we get bitcoin to support more transactions'.  The different clients/approaches are merely ways for groups of people to voice their support for what they believe has the best long term future.
It's a complicated system, not from the technology but from the politics of all the new types of technologies it enables.
The thing is no one really knows how far we can get it to go because it's never been done before so there is no 'right' answer.
We can tread water as it is right now and focus on settlement which has vast potential for the future.  We can focus on micropayments, again someone will solve this at some point so ignoring this has the risk of debunking bitcoin as the primary coin if the new coin can handle vast settlement AND micropayments.  
We can focus on anonymity/fungibility, essential in many countries but vital for future generations to have personal privacy built into the core of future system such that funds retain value anywhere OR we can focus on traceability, compliance with existing infrastructure such that it's adoption and exchange value grows far faster, etc.. all of these have differing points of view and whilst bitcoin can potentially do all of them in time some say it's sensible to focus on one route over another which is why we get various options appear and sounds like fighting.
I.e. this is actually just a healthy debate and part of the experiment.  Whatever comes from it will continually become stronger, it's a fascinating project.

Bitcoin offers the store and transfer of value protocol for the internet, not the utopia of solving "all possible payment options" protocol, well certainly not in its current form.  
I now see bitcoin similar to the email protocol...  email is incredibly useful and like every protocol has it's strengths and weaknesses.  Spam, spoofing and ever tried sending a large video in email?   Email sucks for those flaws, yet it's incredibly good at some things enabling tools to be built on top of it to communicate to anyone around the world.  These days it's also now possible to send video but we can be almost certain it still isn't transferring that 300Mb file via your IMAP/POP3 account because that simply isn't a forte of the email protocols.  Sending that video in an email is possible though because people have built on top of it with additional layers/protocols like HTML that seamlessly enable this capability while still having emails vast upside that html could not do.
Much like scalability isn't a blockchain forte, bitcoin utilises this technology to offer the value layer and it's clear there is a demand for a higher level layer on top for instant payments with almost no fees and perhaps ability for additional things like refunds, receipts, contracts, automation, etc..
I.e. just like we can use email to send that video by email nowadays, systems built on top of bitcoin can offer the vastly scalable faster payments... endlessly extending the blocksize by itself is unlikely to be the solution to scalability..
There are many solutions being worked on that build on top of the bitcoin protocol to solve that scalability (sidechains, treechains, heck even secure sql databases!)... inevitably they'll be competing higher level protocols coming out and the best will rise to the top.  The fundamental thing is these can now be built because bitcoin exists and solves that hard problem in a payment systems where before we needed a bank or private trusted entity.
Just my humble opinion on it all...

Last time I used it was around August last year.  I went to Greece and was showing someone how to use bitcoin there and the wallet failed on me.  Essentially the transaction said it was sent but never arrived at the destination address, was rather embarrassing since it looked like I tried to scam someone.
Also had some other weird odditites happen such as the change amount was listed as the transaction value.  Whilst I can't remember the values it was something like I sent 0.2 btc  out of my 0.3btc to someone but the history would say I sent 0.1btc since that was the change.
I actually really love Breadwallet, particularly the finger print scanner bit, but because it was unreliable at the time I moved over to Mycelium (plus they had the android version, allow different accounts in the same app and the HD seed seems to be a standard).
Overall I'd like to try Bread again if you think it's solved those issues now?

I tend to agree.  It's not by design but using litecoin as the testbed for segwit is vastly more sensible than chucking it directly in bitcoin to discover the problems on large scale usage.
The trick is to make sure Bitcoin can adopt it fast enough if it's proven to work.  The risk is, bitcoin's lack of scaling is making it susceptible to a superior currency overtaking it.  
E.g. if ltc/iota/monero/eth starts getting the simple mix of use "mobile wallets, easy on/off ramps and exponentially accepted in stores", that momentum will be incredibly difficult to stop.
Bitcoin is around to stay but until a digital currency has a vastly scalable microtransaction solution it isn't proven to be THE digital currency solution yet.
I expect we all want that to be bitcoin based but until maleability is fixed to allow sidechains/treechains/LN securely, building this on bitcoin is an unknown.  LTC may well help BTC prove it is safe to integrate yet not rush it.

Sounds like you just want an offline computer to generate the HD key and on your online wallet/computer you use the HD public key there.
I've not seen it as a specific setup to buy but I guess this is precisely what Trezor and the likes do via hardware.
You can probably make this with bitcore libraries pretty easily if you believe there's a market for it.  
@_date: 2016-02-22 09:51:30
Firstly make sure you own the private keys or HD seed to generate those keys... most online wallets don't do this however so unless you get 13 words to write down you're probably wanting to change wallets.
MyCelium and Bread are two great wallets that allow you to do this on iPhone.  Electrum or Armoury on PC is also excellent.  ( selects a popular secure wallet based on your hardware)
You can purchase your coins anywhere but just make sure you transfer them to your control, especially if you're wanting to access them in many years ahead when those companies may no longer exist.
If you're after pure long term storage you could also use a paper wallet from somewhere like bitaddress.org.  Paper wallets are fine for really long term storage but when you want to redeem it you should redeem the full amount which is a bit of a pain, HD wallets however you can keep those 13 words secure and access your funds anytime you like... it's also pretty easy to memorise the words even if all your hardware gets destroyed you'll know the funds are safe!
For $100k I'd certainly recommend buying a Trezor, it's well worth the few hundred dollar investment to know your funds are totally secure.  
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:33:03
It's pretty quick.  You get ~4x the space available as wallets migrate to using the new tx format.  Given this reduces tx fees there's an incentive to make the swap quickly so people don't swap to a wallet that offers lower mining fee costs.
It sounds like most wallets are ready to swap already... the dice sites and the likes will probably take a bit longer to migrate since they have less of an incentive.
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:24:28
If you have the 12 words it is likely to have some sort of order.  Are they written together on a piece of paper?  Left to right, top to bottom, circle, etc... this will vastly speed up the scan time.
It is very very difficult to write 12 words on one piece of paper that are in random order.  It is most likely done by usual left-&gt;right top to bottom.  If that doesn't produce a valid account it may be a different wallet like Bread wallet that was used instead of electrum.

Look like the funds will eventually arrive at 1LpxNcEg4YaVKYsXm72HmL3PFXbkM7qw5D   *IF THEY GET CONFIRMED*.
I say if because what happened is yesterday you sent tx (0a....) with a fee of 0 per bytes used.  These are typically ignored by miners unless there is free space and they are feeling generous... i.e. I don't think these txs work anymore.  
You next tried to send 0.5BTC again with tx (c9....) to another address.  (I assume this destination is the same TO wallet as before but just with a different receive address).  
The problem is this second tx (c9...) is sending funds from the output of your first tx (0a) which has yet to confirm.
I believe this explains it more clearly what's happened... 
Firstly do you know how you sent the first tx with 0 fees?  If this was from blockchain.info please contact them because this is an important bug for them to fix!
If not, please share how you issued this tx so others can learn from it.
Secondly, what to do next.  You can either wait it out for a few weeks until the funds either confirm or are refunded to you.
Alternatively you can look into RBF or Child Pays For Fee... I'm afraid I don't really have much information on how to do either of these though but hopefully someone from blockchain.info will explain if it's possible.

It will either be worthless because a better crypto comes along or it will likely be vastly more than $5k per bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-02-08 22:50:57
Keep in mind anyone in the world can hard fork bitcoin any time they like.  Clearly no one does it because the coins in that new hard fork are worthless as it's not the leading chain with the most hash power on it.
There is so much misinformation and scaremongering about hard forks but deliberate forks are of no risk to users of bitcoin, only a risk to miners who mine on the weaker fork for any significant period of time.  
The only hard forks that are dangerous are ones which are caused by non-deterministic behaviour.  Luckily we've only seen that happen once in the last 4 years and even that was very quickly resolved within a day because no one wants to use the weaker chain.
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:22:42
Fully agree but when you want to help someone get up and running instantly just to try it, a link like that solves that problem.  If you don't trust the generic link people should create another link perhaps using a totally different service that does a similar platform detection... just happens to be the one I trust for my mobile apps.
I realise it may promote one wallet over another but everyone does that in conversation anyhow, very few people have the time to try out all the different options out there.
Clearly it's not the best solution for all scenarios, merely an option I found helpful when simplicity and speed are the goals.

1 week old account, bitcoin user for less than a yea... anyhow.
Bitcoin will either succeed or something better will replace it.  This isn't a fight, it's evolution.  If segwit is going to be so brilliant it will happen in another coin and that coin will rise to dominance.  If segwit isn't important or bitcoin does adapt it remains the dominant coin.  
This is just part of the fun, no point pretending a PoW change is even possible... you either use the bitcoin network or you use another.  Don't waste your effort trying to change something built to withstand emotional engineering.

"More computing power".
The power behind bitcoin is somewhat unfathomable.
If you take a high end home computer and do the mining algorithm on it you'll be lucky to get 1,000,000 mining calculations per second (I think I'm being generous here but for simplicity).
A typical dedicated bitcoin mining machine can do
1,000,000,000,000,000 a second (or 1 Terrahash).
There are the equivalent of 1,500,000 of these machines supporting the network right now drawing around $1,000,000 worth of electricity per 24 hours. 
For a bank to do this with traditional hardware you'd need around 1,500,000,000,000 high end computers which is clearly not possible.  They would therefore have to build/purchase/manufacture and run double this number of machines to just perform temporary 51% disruption.
I'd be surprised of any bank willing to build and sustain this sort of temporary attack.

Typically you don't store that sort of data in the bitcoin blockchain, firstly because it's bloat for everyone else and secondly you'll find it gets expensive.
Instead it's best to take the data you want to store, take a hash of it with something like SHA256 and whack that single value inside a transaction.
Typically you can store single values very easily in the blockchain by using the OP_RETURN op code and putting the data after this.
For slightly larger bits of data you need to store in the blockchain you can put more in the blockheader if you're the lucky miner who solves the block puzzle.  This is how content was originally shoehorned into the blockchain and I believe there are still services offering this but it's generally not a suitable approach for regularly reported data, more for one off approaches.
The next question is what to do with that original source file?  If it's ultra-important to keep the entire contents decentralised for security and historical reasons there are many options out there.
Storj is one such approach, torrents are another.  Typically trusting a 3rd party like Amazon/Google/Dropbox/Cloud service/Your webservers are probably more sensible.  
If those approaches aren't sensible you could write your own blockchain if absolutely necessary or piggy back on something like a NameCoin and/or do another merged mining alt coin for your specific data.  I'd say that's going to be overkill in 99% of the cases but the option is there.
@_date: 2016-09-02 10:07:44
You need to keep in mind that hash rate isn't based on any single computer.  
I.e. it could be 1 machine or it could be 1,000,000,000,000 machines calculating hashes, the point is it takes energy to calculate a hash based on the random nonce + block header.  The more nonces you try, the more hashes you do, the more power you need to spend.
Statistically you need more hashes to obtain a value less than the target the network has agreed on hence how PoW solves ensuring a node is randomly selected to verify the chain.
If you add in IP address such as nonce + ip + header you need to be able to verify that IP was indeed the location that performed the hash, this I believe is impossible to do.  I mean you can just pick a number like 1.2.3.4 and generate a block with that and forward it on as if you've received it from 1.2.3.4, who's to say otherwise?
Computing power inevitably ends up as heat, this is by definition of thermodynamics and what PoW does... the formula used is irrelevant really.
I'm not sure how IP addresses could even have a bearing on it but if you've got an idea on how it could be done definitely worth sharing it as seems sensible to always promote decentralization when possible.

They seem to overlook that a lot of people are building, enhancing, promoting, documenting and training around bitcoin because people are passionate about it and see the huge potential ahead as each challenge is solved.
Generally it's exciting to be involved in replacing an archaic inadequate financial network with a more elegant global one.
Banking employees tend to prefer a steady paycheck and do what they are told to do with a lot of backside covering and bureaucracy to stifle any sort of rapid development and innovation.  The talent totally exists in the banking world to do it too but the supporting structure to embrace radical inventions does not.  It's more about reducing overheads by outsourcing to cheaper development teams to maintain/enhance the existing systems than completely rewriting it efficiently.

I share your questions about LN, so much so it changed our entire business model.  We ditched the 3rd party api approach because the risks of being dependent on another service was considered too high for a foundation level decision.
That said I would have preferred to use bitcoinjs because it already offers payment channels and I expect this is the sort of approach LN will become available to developers wanting to build on top  of bitcoin rather than implementing their own wallets.
I struggled to get bitcoinjs working the way we wanted and eventually went for simple is best and migrated back to bitcoind with RPC calls.
We maintain our own database of accounts/transactions based on wallet notify and block notify features of bitcoind.
I expect when LN becomes established we will migrate to this in time but right now a SQL db will handle the internal accounts and only touch the blockchain when a user deposits or withdraws their money.
It allows us to do cold/cool storage with human verification layer that I'm particularly keen to support.
Would live to know more about your approach/design as perhaps we can compare notes. My main concern is bitcoind stability, I'm putting a lot of faith in this is robust for 100% uptime :)

A mix.  Generally mining pools were groups of people combining hash power to smooth out payments much like a lottery syndicate works.  These recruit miners and those miners are free to swap to other pools as and when they like.
Recently however large money has been used to buy warehouses of mining equipment and they are effectively single users since they actually own the mining equipment.

Gold however is very hard to find in terms of the percentage any human could ever expect to hold, gold doesn't rust and has a unique visual property.  These features make it the great commodity to represent value is all.  
Bitcoin is a vastly better way of showing value to a finite resource since it's mathematically derived and both certainly retain value far better than any fiat currency. The issue with pink salt is it's so abundant and easy enough to produce that representing global value with it becomes unfathomable, no one would attribute much value to it beyond it's direct usage needs.

Why would you not list the bank name?
You've hidden your details understandably but protecting the bank from negative publicity when they've pushed you out makes absolutely no sense.
If you're worried about litigation, remember you can freely share your bank name as long as you don't make unsubstantiated derogatory claims.
Sadly there are too many people who like to do these sorts of things just for attention hence the skepticism.   if you genuinely did have this problem, perhaps make a new reddit post explaining you're a bitcoin holder, had your account closed by ??? after doing ???.
That is purely factual, hard to see why the bank would have an issue with that and you're not exactly going to need to worry about them closing your account anyhow.

I believe the year is 2140 when the last satoshis from block rewards happen.  That said a good significant amount of them will have been mined by 2040 however if bitcoin keeps on it's current trajectory those fractions of a bitcoin may well be worth around the same value as 12.5btc is currently valued at now.
The other important note is that miners also collect mining fees.  If block sizes remain at 1Mb or not but more transactions can be processed, these fees will become more significant earnings for the miners... at least that's the intention.
Other revenue streams are likely to appear, e.g. pay extra to include transactions with the OP_RETURN data, coin mixing services, side chain support, escrow services, etc... It may cause another game theory dilemma given alternative approaches exist but who knows.

An app is signed, sandboxed and self contained.  It has no access beyond it's own files and the permissions you enable when installing.  On iOS it is very difficult to circumvent these security measures and even if they did Apple can remove any malicious apps remotely and prevent that author from submitting more apps under the same developer account.
An exe is a free for all written before the internet was even conceived, it can do whatever it likes and is just ridiculous to expect people to ever consider installing one these days.  An exe has full control over your system, such as install a new keyboard driver, remote desktop client, copy all your files, etc...  heck it can even shut down your antivirus and modify your MBR or bios if it's really determined.

"Hierarchical Deterministic", fancy way of saying you can derive all of your bitcoin addresses from just that single value. 
The reason it is hierarchical rather than just a sequence of addresses is that you can create multiple wallets from a single HD wallet seed.

Just want to chime in for others... true bitcoin is very easy to define, it's the one with the most value being spent on securing it which currently equates to hashing power, it really is that simple.

Have a read of IOTA and the tangle approach, this isn't something bitcoin can be redesigned to do as it's fundamentally different structure to a blockchain of transactions.
They've been rather quiet about how it scales so the jury is still out on if their solution does actually solve it but I believe that is their ultimate goal since the system is designed for machine to machine micropayments where a blockchain is known to be of limited help.

Dont waste time on paper wallets, they're old hap.  Either buy a Trezor if you're doing large sums of money OR just use an HD wallet and memorise/write down the 13 words it gives you.
Now you can spend your cold storage funds easily and delete the wallet from your PC/mobile when you want to make sure no one can spend them.

If vpos is better, start a new chain and survival of the fittest will win. Messing with the main component in bitcoin that is proven absolutely works by technology/game theory and in practice would be absolutely insane.
The adage, ‘if it aint broke dont fix it’ springs to mind.
Also keep in mind a 51% double spend attack needs sustained pow, not a one off blip.  Transferring hundreds of billions of satoshis (ie billions of dollars) will almost certainly have the receiver want to wait many block confirmations before it is deemed safe.

What is your take on iota, they seem to have a different approach to blockchains that may scale?
Ethereum is also gaining on scalability too with what I believe is a LN equivalent  (yet to see this though)

They typically run massive centralised (yet distributed) backed up databases in each bank where all in/out transactions are logged as well as a current state (think mempool &amp; blockchain but without the designed security bitcoin has).  
Each day they process the transactions for the previous day to figure out how much funds they have... it's archaic, think green 1970s screen terminal cobol/fortran stuff is the structure for most banks.   The new stuff is just layered on top or written to replace component at a time but structurally still the same... that lovely banking app you have?  Yep that calls through to some service, perhaps RESTful most likely SOAP or worse.  Under the hood it writes to logs which are picked up on timed jobs to process which produces more logs to process on other systems and so on and so on...  Basically it's so complicated no one dares rewrite the entire lot and so we have crazy things like 24 hour settlements, chargebacks, network downtime and rampant security issues and built in detection for suspicious behaviour/account freezing.
I've even seen excel used for analysis! I mean it can be really mickey mouse stuff when you see how some of these large banks operate.  The problem they suffer from is like all large corporations, no one dare change too much because they have a comfy job and why risk breaking something that works... instead pick easy stuff like optimise what's there or add new features on top.
What stops them cheating?  People trust their accountants and the independent auditors do a cursory glance on what the computer tells them.  If either get those sums wrong they're are massive penalties so they try to make it accurate but is all down to trust on the bank declaring things correctly to those internal and external auditors.
Given they can run fractional banking it doesn't really matter what a bank does anyhow, they just need to show confidence they can repay everyone their money to prevent a bank run that would finish them off.
Basically if you use a bank, just live a happy life not worrying about this stuff and know everything is working fine.

Not sure I understand? Surely its safe to ping a node and say 
‘give me a timestamp &amp; hash of the last state exchange you think we had’.  
If the node gives a hash your node has no memory of it can flag a warning saying
‘The node you have a payment channel with seems to have a more recent state we have not seen. If your machine crashed recently it is recommended to NOT close this channel but request the other side closes it.  Broadcasting an old transaction state may lose all your funds.’
Clearly your node should regularly ping payment channel nodes as the norm (even if it hasn’t crashed) so if an unheard of hash is returned it should recommend blacklisting the node and closing the channel.

Yes it would be.  They posted their whitepaper on tangle on bitcointalk a year ago (and here on reddit I remember it popping up).  It is still based on a transaction ledger, merely it uses each future transaction to validate 2 past ones so the security increases over time as transactions become deeper in the web chain.  I.e. it's the same as a blockchain but no explicit blocks are necessary because the transactions themselves do the validating and proof of work.  If it works it may open the doors to vast sharding which is something a blockchain isn't designed to do (tree chains, side chains and sub chains are all significant approaches that could potentially resolve scalability but they are still all in development and I'm not aware of any on the main net yet).  
Whilst iota is indeed an ambitious goal quite likely to not overtake bitcoin, my original point is bitcoin was designed to be a digital cash system so absolutely must solve this vast scalability issue or it is absolutely certain bitcoin's daily usage will succumb to a stronger coin that does solve it.  
Bitcoin's global store of value/settlement layer is undisputed however, I can never see that changing while it remains secure.
(Personally I'd like bitcoin to be both the cash and settlement layer and perhaps LN/sidechains will achieve this and time will tell)
@_date: 2016-09-13 10:48:11


Yes, absolutely.  I believe to write a system like this yourself you just need the bitcoin client with the transaction notify option set to call your PHP/NodeJS/Ruby script to grab the transaction, check if it has OP_RETURN data and process it to trigger whatever you want.
I remember seeing some blockchain explorers that show the OP_RETURN data but I've not seen any that allow you to specify triggers yet.

I read it as they think people can lose money because if the system came crashing down there was no regulation or insurances to protect the system like we have in regular 3rd party broker markets.
I.e. it’s not about the individuals gains and losses they have an issue with, more they think the system is controlled somehow and everything could disappear with a mistake or malicious actor so they want to regulate them. 
Guessing they just need that lightbulb moment why this is incredibly unlikely to happen.  Its more fear because they dont know why it is so robust.
They’re playing lowest common denominator on regulation and helpless to do anything significant anyhow.  Other countries are embracing it so they’re stuffing their own economy if they lead a fight on cryptos, probably not the best fight to pick when they’re in the process of isolating the country from their main economic partners who wont need to follow any of their new rules.

Get an HD wallet for your device (ios/Android/PC).  If you want a simple link just click this to determine a good HD wallet for your device.  
When you run the wallet it will prompt you to write down the 13 words backup, don't skip this step, write it down with pen and paper.  Now you have these words you will be able to access your funds even if you delete the app from your phone/computer.
Next get a receiving address from your new wallet.  This starts with a '1' so looks something like 1x984353b32j4598dcvn34wer43  .
Now you need to exchange some of your local currency to bitcoin, the safest way to do this is via a regulated exchange such as bitstamp, kraken, coinbase or gemini depending on where you live.  For this example I'd suggest bitstamp.net.    The process takes a day to complete as they need to verify your identity with a passport scan or other simliar id document.  You can optionally use localbitcoins.com or bittylicious.co.uk which may be faster on any ID requirements.
Purchase your bitcoin with a bank transfer/debit card/paypal/etc... and you'll see them appear in your bitstamp account.  Now you just click withdraw bitcoin and place your address from your HD wallet (i.e. your 1x984353b32j4598dcvn34wer43   address).
Now you can delete the app if you really want to (wouldn't recommend it but you could) and your bitcoin are safely stored and untouchable.
When you want to spend, simply install an HD wallet, type in your 13 words again and you now have access to spend those bitcoin funds. (The trick here is to realise the wallet doesn't store the bitcoin, but it stores the password to spend the bitcoin at that address.  The actual bitcoin is stored in the global blockchain ledger hence why you can safely delete your app as long as you have those 13 words written somewhere/memorised)
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:50:44
Agreed, this would be my guess too  (I too didn't read the wall of text but the answer seems reasonable) if you personally have a rack of miners you'd want to make sure they all started at different nonces to avoid doing the same work twice (i.e. the birthday paradox)
If you had 1000 machines you'd certainly want to make sure all 1000 took that 32 bit space and divided it up equally, this is probably best done by taking the 32bit range and dividing this amongst the machines thereby giving more likely nonces found around the power of 2 intervals where it starts..
The definite lines however might also be they've split the nonce range amongst the nodes, i.e. running 4 nodes whereby nonces were spread from those 4.  
The way we see nonces at lower rates in early 100k blocks emerge is probably due to a single miner (or mining algorithm with a starting nonce of 0 and working up very quickly) finding statistically more blocks than other randomly started nonces.  Perhaps that was the age of GPU hashing so all used the same algorithm with nonce=0, nonce++ sort of approach.

I'd suggest swapping to a wallet that used a standard HD seed, if bread wallet disappears one day (and yes Apple can remotely remove the app from your phone), you'll have a hard time recovering your coins as it's not on other platforms.

Because you can buy all the other coins and fiat currencies with bitcoin but not the other way around.
Bcash is a poor copy in that it suffers from the malleability bugs that are now fixed in BTC and LTC (and other cryptos).

Exactly, at a microscopic level it has no value at all.  
At the macroscopic level it has regulation and finite supply characteristics that give it value.  
When looking at the big picture it's not finite or valuable at all, merely about keeping up perception.
There is no harm in having this setup, fractional banking allows us to do incredible things and spread the wealth well because people feel they are getting richer or have accumulated wealth because 99% of us live in that macroscopic level when actually they're not really that much better off than anyone else.
The harm comes from the 1% that make their money pushing the fiat purchasing power down for their own benefit because they don't have their value stored in fiat.

Good article but they are perpetuating this false bit of information.
"By 2040, there will be no new bitcoin rewards for creating and solving blocks as the upper limit of 21 million bitcoin will have been reached."
It's 100 years after that, 2140.  2040 appears an arbitrary date people use where the number of new bitcoin rewarded may become insignificant to expected mining fees but it's still very much there.
Also they're making a simple concept of wallets difficult&gt;  I've found explaining wallets merely hold your passwords to spend bitcoin sent to addresses the wallet generates for you to receive funds on.  The bitcoin are stored in the global blockchain, not your wallet.   That seems to resonate with people faster on how it works and why you can safely delete HD wallets and reinstall them later with your generator seed but your money is still there.

Because if you're a bank you can legally run a fractional reserve scheme on bitcoin. It is illegal for other companies to do this.
It adds liquidity to the market, simplifies interbank operations globally and offers a regulated service for general population to use bitcoin without needing much more security than banks currently provide.
Not saying this will be the status quo, but does seem a likely possible outcome... I'd see it as no more complicated than offering a foreign currency based account option like most major business banks already offer.

A hardware wallet never exposes your private keys to your computer, ever.
A paper wallet you have to trust whatever you use to sweep them not to steal your funds or screw up reusing a R value in the signature for instance.
Also you have to spend the full amount of a paper wallet unless you create an HD paper wallet, at which point you have to trust software running on an insecure device again.
Ie diversification is always a good idea but I would take an open sourced hardware wallet over just paper anytime.

You typically need the private key (which can be used to generate the address it matches).
That said, you can get a seed which generates ALL your private keys for you automatically using an HD wallet.  E.g. download the MyCelium app on mobile or Electrum on PC and it will tell you the 12/24 words to write down which is your seed.
Now you can obtain the bitcoin address from the wallet and after that you can delete the wallet if you'd like.
At any point on any computer in future you can simply reinstall that wallet, type those 12 words back in and you're able to spend the funds.
You don't need to have the wallet installed or running to receive bitcoin since the bitcoin are actually stored in the global bitcoin blockchain db.  The wallet just holds the passwords to spend funds at addresses you control.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:37:44
You can enter your own seed.  The source code is available to all and can verify it generates the same binary (I've not tested that myself because I too believe in their track record in making bitcoin better)
@_date: 2016-09-06 09:26:31
If you have someone elses 13 words, yes you have full access to all their money.  Bitcoin deals with massive numbers, numbers we're not familiar with in daily life and is how the security works.
Those 13 words come from a dictionary of ~2000 words.  So for 13 words you have 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000.  Or put another way, those thirteen words is simply a way to simply write a number between 1 and 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
This SEED number is used to generate all private key numbers (where a private key generates the public key number which in turn gives you the bitcoin addresses we see)
To try all those seed numbers you'd need more energy than can be found in the universe to power the computer to do it... it's just not possible to brute force guess this.
The best analogy I'd heard was if you held two grains of sand.  Now you throw one grain of sand on a vast beach and the other grain of sand somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.  If someone can find those precise 2 grains of sand, that's the same sort of chance someone could 'find' your magic number.
The HD wallet is supposed to follow a standard so in theory those 13 words should work between compatible HD wallets.  I have a feeling Electrum, MyCelium, Bread are all HD wallets but I'm not sure if Bread wallet is using the same standard.  Perhaps someone more familiar with those wallets can chime in.
The 'passwords' are just private key numbers.  These are not stored in the blockchain but are stored by your wallet (or I should say derived from your seed value in HD wallets as described above)  The trick is that you can take the private key number (call it 'K'), from this you can generate a public key number ('P').    P is converted into a bitcoin address (A) which is done by taking a part of the P value and putting some checksum info in.  
This address 'A' is what is typically stored in the blockchain as the lock to the funds.  I say typically because more advanced transactions can actually do more than just have 'A' as the lock value, for instance you could require multiple P values.
Anyhow, to spend 'A' you just need to provide another number called a signature 'S'.    S can only be calculated if you know the original private key number 'K.
The reason S is used and not K is that you never,ever,ever,ever want to publish your private key to the world because if say you accidentally received more funds at A in the future you want to know those new funds will still remain safe and unspendable by others.
So that's it really, if you know that private key number 'K', you can spend any funds sent to and locked by that address A the private key relates to.

This is more about why would people use crypto, not a LN or even a bitcoin specific question.
When a service exists that only accepts a currency people will swap to it.  For instance Americans do not want to swap their USD for Euros to buy that Camembert cheese but they have to.  (Now most of the time this exchange is obfuscated by either end consumers buying from a local retailer who bought from a wholesaler who had to convert their USD to Euro to make the trade) but the point is that exchange had to happen since USD are worthless to Europeans unless their business is with trading for American goods or services.  Again the banks obscure this so 99.9% of the time we don't need to see this but it underpins all global trade.
Anyhow, in time services will accept payment not from Visa/MC but from crypto only, at the moment Bitcoin is the most likely crypto to be accepted since it is the most hardened and therefore most valuable digital commodity to trade with.
This gradual adoption is inevitable as the "cat is out of the bag" as they say and crypto assets are by definition more valuable than an arbitrary bank balance number.
This adoption however is going to be very slow but as new generations appear adoption accelerates.
This adoption is obscured however with the hysteria of boom/bust cycles that will happen as people try to get rich by gambling on short term perceived value changes. 
We can guarantee future banking crisis, stock market crashes... this isn't fear-mongering, it's how equilibrium is brought to the supply/demand relationship where fractional banking is used and is just an inevitable result of this cyclic feedback relationship.  (typical 10 year cycle if you look at historical trends)
When this next 'crisis' happens it's inevitable cryptos will appear in the spotlight again and people will rush to it in fear causing another boom/bust cycle.  Unfortunately these cycles of hype/disillusionment mean we probably won't see an 'epiphany day' where people realise they want to use crypto more than banking and will just happen organically.
My hunch is banks will abstract much of this away so people continue to use USD/Euro/GBP/Yen etc but under the hood there will be settlement via cryptos which will allow banks to do direct payments between two banks that don't have a payment network or settlement house agreement... yes that does mean countries that adopt whatever that leading crypto first will be better off financially in future... a race I'm anticipating to silently begin in the next 2-7 years.
So to answer your question, just like people thought it was insane to use a bank to replace trading with gold and now it's the norm to use a bank, eventually people will want to have their value backed by a crypto but it's not going to be a conscious swap but instead adoption will be pretty seemless IMHO, not a 'oh I have to pay with this now and how do I use LN?'

* Do you need multiple tumblebit nodes or do Alice and Bob have to communicate via a single node?
* Would it be sensible to give tumblebit addresses a URI scheme or is a bitcoin address still going to work when you aren't sure if Alice or Bob are using the system?
* Do transaction fees remain the same as if you were putting the transaction on the blockchain, (if so this would be a disadvantage of LN where fees can be much cheaper)
* How would a mobile wallet provider like Bread or MyCelium integrate with this system?

When a bug is discovered and funds are stolen it will hinder people trying it.

You can find the node that relayed the tx to you but clearly it's unlikely that node created the tx.
The node itself won't keep a history of where it got the tx from so you need someone who is monitoring the network connections of the node and determine which one heard the tx first.
This process needs repeating again and again to be  be certain. 
I don't think bitcoind encrypts the traffic so appears doable if you have the resources and legal entitlement/cooperation with isps/cloud services.
With thousands of nodes it's generally not viable except intercepting key public nodes like Coinbase, blockchain.info, electrum servers, bread? Mycelium, etc.. to pick up the SPV wallet users.  
Given the geographical issues involved its therefore not too likely all of these are monitored but you can bet most are.
Generally the best way to track txs would be blockchain analysis and association of addresses to/from known exchanges.  Probably involves phone calls and speaking to people about the nature of their tx but if determined enough and with legal powers for server logs it becomes totally viable for most bitcoin transactions.

A nation could have their own digital currency, but not their own decentralised crypto.
A nation controlling a crypto is a daft concept, the game theory for NOT destroying it disappears when you have other nations that would benefit from a nation's cryptocurrency becoming more valuable than theirs.  Actually it will guarantee the majority of nations would be against your crypto working reliably.  
E.g. If you were Iran you'd be sure you couldn't muster enough control over that network or currency to prevent an attack, certainly wouldn't have the bandwidth to be ahead in the cryptowars of what is and isn't possible with cutting edge maths/computing.
If it were a large country like America/China/Russia/EU they would be inviting every country pissed off by wars or trade embargos to silently collaborate to undermine the currency at critical times (either technically with PoW/PoS attacks or by simply manipulating the market with huge pump and dumps).  
Basically cryptocurrencies only work if everyone is equal and they are decentralised / not controlled by any centralised entity people may want to target.  Anything else and you're asking for SWIFT/PayPal approach which is what we already have and other nations know they can't trust it.

A qc may be able to derive the private key from the public key in future but they’d have to do it before the next block was found to double spend. 
Since the public key is only exposed when spending the funds its pretty safe for the foreseeable future because 10
Mins to crack a 256bit ecdsa key is beyond what we believe a qc can do currently.
But you are right that as QCs become faster and more powerful this signing process will have to be hardened in time (adding new features like this without hardforking is made easier with segwit)
A very very simple qc fix might be to optionally issue a PoW with a tx that takes &gt;1hr to calculate. This doesnt even need to enter the blockchain, just be used by nodes to know if they should relay a txs

How do you define 'first to find the block'?  You can't do it on timestamp and what happens if it takes 60 seconds to propogate a block but during that time someone else finds a block, or two.  This is precisely why there is a reasonable gap to allow nodes to establish what is the likely longest PoW chain.  Too short and you get lots of blockchain forks that keep needing to be resolved so you have to end up waiting for more than 1 confirmation to be sure your transaction ends up in the longest proof of work chain.  Too long and the system becomes cumbersome to use.
10 mins is just an arbitrary settlement time to establish a truth that is vastly faster than the 3+ days banks use.
Remember transactions are spread and detected immediately, confirmations are merely to ensure people don't double spend the funds.  Layer 2 applications should hide this delay anyhow.

'Broken' SHA256 is not what most people understand it as.  When someone says hashing algorithm XYZ is broken, what they mean is someone managed to create two input datasets the produce the same hash output... i.e. a collision.
Totally broken would mean they can be given a hash value and make some custom data to generate that hash on demand.
The jump from one to the next is absolutely massive.  Should someone be able to show they can generate a collision with SHA256 it would be enough to consider adopting a new hashing mechanism, at least for mining.  There would still be many many years, if ever before a collision could be used to exploit bitcoin for financial gain.

Not even the most powerful supercomputers working in unison could make any noticeable difference to the security of the ledger.
They were most likely preparing to mine an alt currency like monero and swap that for bitcoin.
The absolute worst a gov could do would be use a  a top secret unannounced qc capable to derive a private key, and that’s a big if not to mention guaranteed treason of using state secrets since absolutely every thing on the internet/computers would be broken. Heck even the power management on chips meaning everything is open, ie it’s unlikely to happen and certainly not first to happen on bitcoin for personal gain.

This just shows how the media scaremongering is working. This has absolutely nothing to do with attempting to change governance with fear, it is purely a criminal offence the bandits are doing.
Whilst paying them sucks both because they may get away with it but also encourages the offenders to continue, sometimes 10btc is nothing to restore business data.
What is unusual here is those criminals must be rather intelligent to perform such an attack but so stupid to demand payment in 18 hours as they must realise it is unlikely anyone could purchase that much btc as a new account.
For that reason I would expect it's a scam and may not honour it.
If you can negotiate a longer time frame or less a price you may get information to identify them and/or eventually restore your data.  All you need is their private key number (or for them to obtain it to send to you later)
Also if it's a business, you will probably find copies of the original files in caches on other machines if more than a couple of people work there.
Best of luck, and tell their IT person to automate those backups.

Interesting approach but I seriously doubt a NN could derive reversable order from the produced hashes.  
Each bit in a hash should have an equal probability of occurring, if it doesn't there is something wrong with the hashing algorithm... it's one of the key traits it must have.
A NN can't learn from uncorrelated data IMHO, NNs look for lowest minima solutions which clearly can't exist in an equal probability function like a cryptohash.

Not paranoid but unlikely to happen.  If China bans bitcoin it's value there degrades since people aren't allowed to sell it, therefore it's literally throwing their money away and mining isn't cheap.
If it's an intentional attack it can not be sustained or if they do a chain reverse it would only happen the once since we would almost all migrate to a different pow with a fixed fork thereby destroying any long term advantage they would have tried to achieve.
As a short term one off attack to lower the price it would however be pretty effective.

I'm merely sharing my view of why I won't use it and I expect others may share this too.
The barrier to entry to build from source is too high for the potential return since ebay works well.  I, like majority of others, won't spend the time learning about it to sell stuff there.  Secondly if the sellers can't be arsed you can be sure the buyers are even lazier, they just want to buy stuff and not play with software / code reviews.
It needs to be simple and safe from a user perspective, not a code one.
Don't get me wrong, I think OpenBazaar is a great project and will lead to great things, but as it is now I don't use it because of these complications that make the chicken/egg problem far harder to solve.
One solution is someone to offer a web based portal into it (not just viewing but ability to buy/sell via the portal).  Yes it isn't decentralised but just like LN can be decentralised if you decided to run a node, you don't need to yet you can still participate in the network.  The fact that it can be run decentralised means making it always decentralised is not a necessity for most users, OB would do well following this ethos IMHO.

Firstly we all trade money, the Internet was created after payment systems so they aren't well suited for the digital age and certainly not the way payments will be handled in future, bitcoin or not.
If a country bans their citizens from using it they would prevent their country from engaging in the early stages of a new emerging market while the rest  of the world races ahead embracing it.
Outlawing it merely outlaws the legitimate uses therefore allowing it means they get the benefits as well as being competitive.  They still collect taxes on profits, they still require taxes in their national currency... Ie it's of no threat to a country.
 
Equally bitcoin will likely replace some now superfluous banking functions, if anything it gives countries more control back from the banks which arguably control more power than most governments since the private banks now effectively control a nations economy.

Make sure you follow the law, bitcoin is traceable so you want to make sure everything you do with it is above board.
To answer your question, you could purchase bitcoin from the usual exchanges or direct by using places like localbitcoin.  I'm not familiar with laws in Hawaii but I would be surprised if owning bitcoin was problematic but I guess that's something you'll have to look into... 
Once you own btc trading online is rather easy so finding someone to take your btc for some alt coin should be easy.
If you're wanting simplicity and happy paying a premium you can use services like Shapeshift as found in many wallets like Jaxx that will facilitate an exchange for you.
There are also P2P exchanges popping up for crypto coin-&gt;crypto coin,  or just do it directly (with escrow) by finding someone willing to do an OTC trade.
I did this for one trade before, the escrow/btc trade was fine but the crypto coin I bought was rubbish and all my funds vanished due to their rubbish software... i.e. beware of investing in new coins, many are not battle tested so is very high risk.
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:52:36
Can say I looked into doing this a few years ago.
It is certainly possible but the risks were too high to continue at the time.
Firstly premium rate numbers/texts charge an extortionate fee that makes it almost unviable by itself.
After that you run into problems with people scamming the service, e.g. "borrowing" someone's phone and send a premium text and wham they've stolen their money.  Most likely you'll have a chargeback in time so your fees have to be even higher to cover the fraudulent transactions (remember you can't grab back your bitcoin).
That said, it certainly has a place for low volume, low amounts but quick easy access.  The question is, would people be willing to take ~50% fees?   You also need to spend legal money to do it properly to ensure you are adhering to the AML/KYC compliance.  
Guess what I'm saying is, a few years ago it seemed a challenging business to become profitable, things may have changed and if you can get lower fees from a telco it certainly is viable.

One of us has incorrect information if this is indeed the case so allow me to recap my understanding and you can correct me if I have misunderstood something otherwise I can't see an issue in my suggestion...
1) A counterparty node can take all the funds in a channel if they detect an old state is broadcast because newer transactions reveal the old 'R' which allows for all the funds to be spent.
2) A node can normally only obtain the funds owed to it at anytime by simply and safely broadcasting the latest state.
3) Both nodes will have a copy of the latest channel state for both participants.  Therefore an old state is only broadcast when one of the following things happen
* One of the nodes has forgotten the latest state (HW failure/software bug/reset before serialising to disk).
* The counterparty node is being malicious and trying to spend the funds without the counterparty noticing.
* A hacker has obtained an old tx in the payment channel and broadcast it on the blockchain to annoy those on the channel.
This therefore means having the two nodes involved in the payment channel asking 'what do you think the latest state is?' via a timestamp/hash of last state is a simply sanity check nothing has gone awry.  If there is a discrepancy it doesn't necessarily mean they have to share and agree the latest state, merely they should both stop using the channel and wait for the counterparty to publish the latest state if the counterparty has a more recent timestamp.

I believe there was a push to spam the network to validate BCC to exist and why larger blocks were needed.  The only way to increase tx prices was to fill the blocks with spurious txs, it was nothing about real use of the network at the time.
The fact that it's not a gradual incline/decline in tx rates or mirroring price movements would indicate the tx rate earlier was not related to perception of the network.

Gets better, China banning it is like outlawing chemistry. Eventually they'll need it to achieve something such as buying/selling products overseas, automation or wanting to diversify investments. At which point the ban gets overruled OR someone exploits the mess by opening a foreign company that accepts their currency and handles the bitcoin transaction for them at a premium the rest of the world doesn't need to pay.
My hunch is a China coin will appear to facilitate bitcoin transactions but you have to be on the approved list to access it.  It will be centralised so fraught with breaches or expensive maintenance to make it viable longterm and useless to the rest of the world but let's wait and see...

Stop thinking of them as coins, they're not.  They are merely an integer value in a database whereby an arbitrary value of 100,000,000 is called 1 bitcoin for humans to avoid all those digits.
Anyone at anytime can almost instantly add these balances in the global unspent transaction outputs each node maintains to verify it is less than the 210,000,000,000,000 units.
But more importantly when money is actually transferred, the source of the funds is verified to exist in an earlier block.  Ie if the rules dont change you can be certain the money was created as per the rules people call bitcoin which gives the limits like how many bitcoin can ever exist.

They will however repeat what they've read about it in articles, sadly the headline sensationalist topics get mentioned time and time again so they still read about MtGox, SR, China bans or other shady uses of bitcoin rather than what it enables. I'm guessing they repeat these stories to their friends when the topic comes up which sort of reaffirms their belief it being dodgy so never take the time to look at it.

Actually, just thought again, if you know an 'earlier' address that wallet used, you can extract the public key from there.  If there are funds still at that address you will be able to recover those via a QC eventually.  As for the actual wallet, honestly think you'll be able to recover it with bruteforce.  Remember you're unlikely to use something like "&lt;M234koiuNB35jhli345nbIU£$%j43,njk" because that would be a real pita to type each time.

Not obvious how it can be done in scale.  How can anyone prove there are not two physical coins using the same private key or that the key actually has funds on it that others can also access?
A trusted issuer might be able to do it like a central bank.
Casascius coins worked well because there were so few around and Mike has shown he’s trustworthy given how long they have been in circulation without duplicates or funds stolen.
FiniteByDesign and Leana coins have also been doing this too and look beautiful but hard to see them being used as regular currency since there are so few and aimed at high value coin collectors.
It is vastly harder to do now given how much attention bitcoin gets.  It seems more likely bitcoin would be used to back a 3rd party trusted token like fiat currency than directly traded physical bitcoin.

You can only get your funds stolen from a hardware wallet in one of three ways.
1) Your back up phrase is found by an attacker.  If you write those 12/24 words down on a computer that is a massive weak link.  Writing it with pen/paper and put into a sealed envelope or equivalent offsite storage is a good idea.
2) The seed used was derived from a poor random number generator, hardware wallets should be pretty protected against this given they are open source and people can verify how it works.
3) There is a the $5 hammer approach where the attacker gets you to transfer the funds.  To prevent against that you can use the extra word approach most hw wallets allow to have hidden accounts
Key loggers, viruses, etc however can't effect the HW wallets since all that goes to the device is where you want to pay to.

I would guess it's trying to trick other bots.  Some bots may do something like look at the most recent buy/sell match and look at the  next nearest buy/sells to see what the delta is going up or down.
Since this could be manipulated by one large buy/sell order the bot may count how many bids/asks there are at the next price point rather than the sum of them.
Basically it's cat/mouse and someone is doing something not expected aiming to trip up bots at a guess.
Another reason might be trying to sell gradually without crashing the market but I doubt that's what is happening here since it's such a small amount and for the same value (5519.70 for instance)

Great idea.
How's about any of these
* Funding some lobbiests to make closing bank accounts unlawful.  Probably far more expensive than 10btc but mentioning it anyhow.  I.e. a person/company should be presumed innocent unless found at fault and entitled to having a bank account.  In an era where banking is such a key part of society a bank account with reasonable fees should never have to fear about having it closed for no wrong-doing.
This would allow bitcoin companies to begin to flourish given the private banks are the ones holding back nations from benefiting from it.
* Fund some open source graphics people can use.  A repository of helper videos, training slides.  Perhaps this already exists?
* A competition of who can place/stencil a bitcoin QR code in the most interesting place each month voted for by reddit users.  Winner gets 0.1btc.

Holding them is clearly the safest long term approach, they don't deterioate overtime and it's finite so you know you own that fraction of the supply.
If you want to take chances on increasing your share of that supply the best ways I can think of are
* Spend some and repurchase them.  This cycle is essential for merchants to want to accept them, I can't stress how important this is for rapid adoption.
* Share some of your coins with friends and relatives.  As bonkers as it may sound, by people seeing bitcoin is usd by people they know and trust so isn't some underground nefarious thing attitudes will become more positive and more people will make the effort to understand it and the ecosystem will grow even faster.
* Invent something that needs bitcoin.  Sell items for bitcoin on craigslist or wherever.
High risk activities
* Invest in bitcoin companies.  Some will succeed and these will be the ones that increase everyone's bitcoin exchange value dramatically.  If people don't invest in these companies it will take a lot longer to gain adoption.
* Play the stock market, shorting/going long on bitcoin.  Almost a recipe for losing coins really but mentioning it.
* Invest in bitcoin mining hardware with your btc... probably a terrible idea unless you have free electricity &amp; technical background but you can do the sums on that.
* Invest in BTCJam Haverlock type investments for a % growth.

If you own the private keys, once the funds have appeared in addresses you own the transaction is pretty much done.  If someone was trying to potentially rip you off, merely wait for the confirmation of the transaction and you know it is unreversable so the money is confidently yours at this point.
Some wallets that allow you to have the private keys are  MyCelium, Bread, Electrum, bitcoind and Jaxx.  
You can also get a hardware wallet if you're nervous about malware/viruses, those things are incredibly robust.
Buying your bitcoin is best done via an exchange but you can use P2P systems too, just need to make sure the reputation is good and/or use an escrow service if the amounts are larger than a few hundred dollars for instance.

Because simple numbers were used for the mining reward algorithm, i.e. 50 btc per 10 minutes, to be halved every 4 years.
But why 50 btc?  Well because 21,000,000 bitcoin is actually 
2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis.
This is very close to the upper limit of what can be stored precisely due to the 53 bit mantissa in a 64 bit floating point number as described by IEEE used in most languages and chipsets...

Because it should be easy to repurchase it, it's safer to use than a credit card online, can be transferred person to person directly and because it's only got value when others are willing to trade for it.  If people don't trade it becomes a speculative asset which will have a massive correction flushing out those who wanted to get rich quick.  
To sustain bitcoin's increase in value, more people have to be using it.
Right now it's tricky because we are still waiting for layer2 stuff to make daily transactions actually viable.

You are correct about a number of these things but feels like to might be overlooking that people are speculatively investing in an uncopyable finite digital asset.
The Internet was designed to have one of these from the very start but turned out it was incredibly difficult to do(well actually was considered impossible after some research) 
Bitcoin on its current form will never be mainstream just like all network protocols.  It does however facilitate global payments and more and companies will inevitably use this or something like it to describe value transfers since it is secure and has no controllers.
Ie bitcoin is worth vastly more that the current dollar exchange rate if it remains the leading open source value protocol  (which I should mention, I like many others don't use us dollar rate since I don't live in America)
If bitcoin fails, another will spring up addressing whatever shortfall wss identified just like evolution does with biology.

Because someone could release their own OB version which has a trojan in at which point anything can happen..
Easy obvious ones with probably off the shelf scripts...
* bitcoin addresses displayed anywhere get mogrified to the attackers address.  This could be onscreen in any window, in copy/paste buffer or on internet traffic itself.
* key loggers/VNC installed
* reverse SSH setup.
More advanced
* Delayed payloads, boot sector modification, 
* Replication over WAN, 
* windows user accounts extracted
* Scan various keys like windows product key to resell on OB
* Skype interception/rerouting
* TOR node / botnet setup
* Autoupdaters
* Compromising browser communication
Releasing via the windows store would help mitigate this but I doubt many people think to use the windows store these days as most things have moved online.

Buy a little each month over a couple years, can't go too far wrong if you're trying to minimise risk yet want to be involved as an early pioneer.
I wouldn't bother with bch unless it gains more hash power than bitcoin IMHO.
Ethereum is different so won't comment on that, look at each Cryptocurrency in its own merit.
I would suggest making sure you do the whole buy/sell cycle using bitcoin so you're comfortable that you're not being swept up in hype or focusing on the exchange rate.  Be forgiving in its usability and high fees since these will vastly improve over time, it's more about being secure and independent of needing any private companies.
Ie bitcoin value only gets stronger as people discover and utilise its advantages over legacy financial networks.  Countries can benefit by relieving a lot of dependencies on foreign banks or needing to trust them for instance.

It would increase the bandwidth if we had a bigger block size or more blocks per hour but that isn't why we have 10 minutes blocks.
That 10 minute size was an initial parameter to control supply rate whilst giving the upper limit of a float as the maximum coins in circulation.  
It gives the system enough time to make sure there is a good degree of confidence in the longest proof of work chain to be established by the nodes.  It could be less nowadays with faster networks but isn't that significant really.
People would be mad to mess with this 10 min hardcoded value since it doesn't offer much tangible benefit but would hard fork the chain causing market uncertainty that only traders benefit from... i.e. it's best done in an alt coin and has been.  
If the change is actually beneficial we'd see those chains usurping bitcoin.  For example litecoin does exactly this withg 2.5 mins so clearly this block frequency isn't too important given people haven't moved to using litecoin over bitcoin for just this feature.
I see why you're saying this about bandwidth but have to call out this is nothing to do with the blocksize.

Not sure I'm afraid.  Bitcoind uses key stretching to generate the private key value used to encrypt/decrypt everything.
With that private key it next uses AES cipher block code approach to do the cryptography which is a symmetric encryption system.  I.e. the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt it, I'm therefore not sure how a QC is going to help here.
I guess if there was some pattern data in the wallet you know you could be looking for it might be possible to use a QC to derive the key from that data but seems quite tricky... basically this is beyond my knowledge now.
I see in QC there is Grover's quantum search algorithm, this reduces the AES problem from 2^256 to 2^254... i.e. it's pretty useless.
If it's your wallet, you must know vague limits on the password (e.g. length, if you'd use crazy characters, uppercase) and may be able to brute force it that way.  There is a wallet recover service (I think it's Dave's wallet recovery) which is worth checking out, he might be able to help.

It is probably possible but what you need to consider is a picture is reflected light.  This means you need some fancy image processing going on to do the following
1) Normalize the image such that lighting conditions don't change the number produced at the end
2) orientation and perspective changes still produce the same number
3) Resolution and reflectance don't obscure the number.
One approach to solve this is taking the picture, doing edge detection to get a number of key points/lines from the image.
With these points and lines produce a feature map that can allow for a lot of error handling.  
All of this makes it very difficult to do and I'm not sure how the error handling part could work but I've thought about this before as well.  Seems adding together the values of features and quantizing it may get the answer but too much quantizing means the number itself is not very random so the system becomes insecure.
An easier route is to take your picture, SHA256 it and use that as the private key... that will work but means you need the original file :)
Best approach is to simply embed a subtle QR code into your image, I already do this for images which I print out on canvas.  Happy to do one for your if you'd like  (&gt;2048 image width required) (For a 60cm x 40cm (24" x 16") picture it's 0.98BTC+ postage costs where most of that cost is getting the canvas made).

You don't need to make a new address for receiving at all, it's perfectly safe to reuse an address many times to receive payments on.
There are two reasons it's suggested to use a new address each time you receive bitcoin though...
1) Because you can easily identify who sent you the funds since you gave each person a unique address.  For merchants this is more important than for personal use since personal use you don't really care about specific invoices being paid or not and probably have a good idea of why someone's giving you money at a given point of time.
2) When you transfer funds from an address you expose your public key, whilst currently this is still secure should quantum computers come to exist there is a 'potential' security risk in that someone may be able to derive your private key from this information.  Currently this task is still well beyond the realm of anyone in the public and probably beyond the realm of quantum computers as I'm sure we'd have heard about a heist or two by now!  The main reason people suggest it is paranoia, if you use a new address each time this sort of future potential attack vector isn't even possible to consider.
You wallet sums up all values stored in all addresses you've used.  Something like bitcoind creates a batch of something like 100 addresses to use in future, so when you back up your wallet it backs up all your used addresses AND the 100 unused addresses to be used in future.  This is why you should back up your bitcoind wallet.dat file regularly if you make lots of transactions, if you restore from a wallet 102 transactions ago you'll lose access to that last 2 transactions.
To avoid this issue many wallets have now moved to HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets.  The main difference here is that the private key (i.e. that large random number) is derived from a single seed (Your public key number is derived from your private key and your address string is derived from that public key number).  This means if you know that seed number you can derive every private key, hence ever address you'll ever use on that wallet so the seed number is the only thing that needs backing up.

He convinced a lot of smart people in private he was Satoshi via convoluted crypto methods (later shown to be a signing trick which should have been the end of this all but here he is again) and that was only be possible if he knew a bit about ecdsa is my issue.

The miners don't have the ability to sign someone else's transaction so miners can't fake votes or change submitted votes, it's one key reason why a blockchain is so secure.  
Whilst miners could choose to ignore votes it only takes one ethical miner to accept someone's vote and discover the block solution to have all valid votes recorded in the chain. 
Voters can be certain if their vote was counted or not as their own PC can read the approved blockchain and tally the responses.
If the issuing of the vote tickets weren't centralised it would be the perfect system... What could be proven is X voting options were issued and of the X votes which votes were cast for which outcome.

She's clued up and impressed she has taken the time to learn about bitcoin.  The comment "Too expensive at the moment", is somewhat surprising though.
  
To say something is too expensive is an indication that it has reached it's plateau so has a value but considered overvalued.  
Going up a further 10% in just days since that interview would indicate it was actually rather cheap before, seems she's still figuring out how much it could be worth in future too.

I believe market cap is calculated by price people are willing to pay for the stock * current stock available.  Right now the market cap is aiming for $880K via price fixing of a small share of the stock, i.e. this is not an open market so the market cap can't be extrapolated like this... instead introducing coins later that aren't part of this presale are equivalent to QE where the supply is increased such that 1BTC/25000Neu now becomes 1BTC/(25000 x supply increase)Neu = 1BTC/(25000x220) = 1BTC buys 5,500,000Neu coins.

They didn't mess up the ID, they either intended to send them to your friend (perhaps they have a bitcoin address posted on a website/video/etc.. so just received a donation?) or they have sent your friend funds in the past and simply clicked on the wrong 'send to' contact item.

An address is actually made from the process of 
address = get_hash(  get_public_key_from_private( private_key ) )
So you start with your private_key number, you now use a function to generate the public key.  This is supposed to be one way (and is so far).
Once you have a public key you can generate a hash of it to generate your address.
A quantum computer in theory can solve reversing that stage of public_key to private key.  I say in theory because it's not actually simply refactoring primes which most people quote, it also has a lot of modulus maths used which probably makes it trickier, but assume this part could be compromised from a QC.
The part of going from an address to a public key however is not something I've ever heard a quantum computer can help with.  The main reason is this is process is done via arbitrary bit logic gates which a QC is pretty unhelpful for.
So funds will be safe even with the existence of QC.  Where they may be at risk is if you've spend any of the funds at an address but not moved the funds to a new address after since you have to post your public key at the spending stage.
That all said most wallets handle moving all spent funds to a new address automatically so should mitigate this risk.
The only risk therefore is if someone writes their own wallet and screws it up or a QC can solve the public key-&gt;private key conversion faster than a block confirmation time (unlikely at the moment).
When QCs become viable to do this we will probably have moved another step forward to prevent this attack with new crypto commands added to bitcoin anyhow.
For instance we may like to consider adding an emergency bit of code whereby the first transaction using ECDSA signatures takes priority in mempool to prevent simple attacks while people migrate to a QC resistant signature system.

The government doesn't control the flow of their 'digital money' of it's currency, only private banks and payment companies do.  The process is opaque and problematic because a country needs to trust these private institutions to behave ethically when they're incentivized to actually make money instead.  
Basically bitcoin is fully open and visible to everyone and the ledger is a single point of truth the world can agree on.  It can't be gamed so if you have 1btc you know you have at least 1/21,000,000th of the available supply and that fact is a certainty.

Wait, like 1 bitcoin today is somehow not worth 1 bitcoin tomorrow??
This volatility argument needs to be at least put in perspective so let's use 1 day's worth of data shall we?
"1 euro today is worth $1.161 and yesterday it was worth $1.174" i.e. **A euro went down 1% in 1 day.**
"1 bitcoin today is worth $7300 USD and yesterday it was worth $6700".  **A bitcoin went up 9% in 1 day.**
Perhaps that's unfair it was a rally yesterday for bitcoin, perhaps we should look at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, etc... every time bitcoin is out performing the euro.  What has to be highlighted here is the Euro is controlled via the ECB, bitcoin is open to the world and not controlled... as a non-european it's clear which one people will eventually trust more.

I believe the timestamp must be within some tolerance to be accepted by another node but it is technically possible to have one block followed by another block that has an earlier timestamp because of this.
The entire block header has SHA256(SHA256(block header)) to get the hash value.
This is why transactions can continually be added to the block that is being mined if you so wanted since it merely updates the merkel root and the chances of you picking a winning nonce/extra nonce is virtually identical even if you change the merkel root.

Blockchain.info API is excellent and no need to change from it unless you need to send money out.
If you do need to send money (from your server that is) you may like to consider bitgo as this way you can put transfer limits on what can be removed from your wallet which isn't possible with blockchain.info's approach since there's is very close to bitcoind RPC layer which has no protection if your keys are hacked/leaked somehow.

They've got very slick execution on bitcointalk, their website, wiki, etc... a lot of work has gone into this so will be disappointed and amazed if everyone involved knows it's a scam.  
My issue with it is they post 4% of the coins (0.1 billion) are available in this presale where the other 96% (2+ billion) are essentially given out for free later (barring investors who would have stumped up cash at a guess).  
The purchased coins are each sent to unique addresses and not immediately forwarded on to the holding address for people to view.  This means it's impossible to truly know how much people have invested at this stage and just have to trust their website.  If they really wanted to be open and honest about it they should have published their xpub key so the wallet can be tracked or immediately consolidate the funds to a single address later.
Any which way I add it up this appears like either a pump and dump or they do have some amazing new PoS tech and I'll just wait until the coins are available on the open market.  Given 2 billion more neucoins are dumped into the system later massively diluting this original 0.1 billion they are selling right now it seems like a guaranteed 94% discount or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how these 2 billion coins are introduced later?
The fact they only accept bitcoin as payment in the presale highlights that bitcoin is a superior form of utility value so will not be trading them for neucoin.  If Neucoin is legitimate I wish them the best and will stock up in May/June time after the dump.

They seem to miss the point that if we eradicate cash and had negative interest rates people would simply find and use other monetary systems. 
If any of those could be traded globally, digitally, instantly and easily person to person with fungibility and pseudonymously,  it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that would become the way people would choose to transact.

Ok so the '1...' is your address... i.e. that's safe to publish anywhere as people can only send money to it.
The private key (i.e. the password for that address) starts with a 5...   You can extract the private key from the command line of bitcoind or bitcoin-qt console using that dumpprivkey command.  I've not done it myself so but I think the steps will be
Enter walletpassphrase &lt;your passphrase&gt; 60
Enter dumpprivkey &lt;your 1.... address with all the bitcoins&gt;
Now you can type that 5..... key into mycelium to spend from it.
Alternatively just wait until bitcoind syncs?   
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:33:32
The public key is still considered incredibly secure and has not been compromised to anyones knowledge.  But it does mean if a qc comes along in future it may be able to reverse this process one day.
The main issue is spending twice from the same address and the same random number is used twice.  This allows someone to easily find the private key and there are active bots always looking for this.
All reputable wallets are safe from this but custom wallets may make this mistake as has happened in the past.

"I wasn't expecting to have a different wallet on my PC than on my phone"
Just to highlight, this is not a bitcoin limitation merely a niche ready to be filled by a wallet provider.  Your funds are stored on the global blockchain, not your mobile or PC.
Webwallets like blockchain.info will work and they do have an app on iOS but is a bit clumsy to use due to all the passwords they insist on using (for access and for spending) it makes it unusable in a practical way.  If they sorted that part out so it used touchID and allowed you to optionally disable the password for small daily spends (e.g. up to $10 per day before a password is requested) I'd recommend their wallet again, otherwise Bread wallet it is since this is just touchID and so much more usable.
If Bread wallet had a PC/Android counterpart I'd be recommending this 100%.
If they all agreed to use the same mnemonics/HD mechanism (as stated in the Bitcoin Improvement Protocol guideline) we will eventually be able to use any wallet and have access to your funds from any of these wallets regardless to PC or mobile.  
HD wallets are still relatively new so is taking a while for standardised adoption to occur but is happening if that's reassuring to hear.

The word pool is a standard list of 2000 words.  Essentially the word is just a convenient way to write a number between 0-1999.
There are at least 12 of those words used to make a 2000 ^ 12 value number... i.e. it's a really vast number.
That said, you are absolutely right to question what prevents two identical sets of words being chosen.  Computers are inherintly rubbish at picking random numbers, all they can do is try to increase the entropy to such a point that it's unfeasible to recreate that same set of input criteria.
I.e. it will take at the very minimum the seed number plus a number of iterations.   The seed number is basic RNGs will be simply the current time for example.  This will be xORd with another value such as a seeding value specified by the algorithm.
So if you know the start time (or iterate through the start times) and know how many times rnd() was called you can reproduce the identical random number.
Luckily all bitcoin wallets use crypto-standard random number generator which is vastly more complicated and has far more data points added to prevent such a simple replay attack.
There have been wallet hacks in the past because the random number generator used was the basic one found in libc for instance, luckily I'm pretty sure every wallet out there does it correctly now otherwise you'd be hearing about regular thefts!
Next a wallet also is likely to use human input such as the time between keystrokes, mouse movements, accelerometer values to increase the entropy.  Basically anything with a number that can change values in a rather random way can be used.
Hardware wallets like Trezor go to incredible lengths to make sure enough entropy is used.  You can see the source code here for instance...
Anyhow, yes be skeptical of any wallet providing you an instant set of 12 words without some sort of details about how it generates them.  Overall though reputable wallets where the source code is available are your best bet.

"Bitcoin becoming harder and harder to mine and prices slumping, could this create a problem?"
This is the misunderstanding here, bitcoin is not becoming harder and harder to mine.
The hashing difficulty goes up AND down based on how much processor power is thrown at the problem such that on average a solution is found every 10 minutes.  It has been going up constantly for years simply because the bitcoin value has been going up and there is a delay between buying mining hardware and getting a return on it.  
Should the exchange rate lower, it costs more in electricity than the bitcoin mined so miners simply turn off their machines (as you say the most inefficient ones will be turned off first) and when the mining difficulty readjustment happens after 2 weeks, if loads of machines have been turned off the problem gets easier such that the remaining machines will on average find a block in 10 minutes.
It's a beautiful self reinforcing system... also mining does not really effect the price other than by causing inflation of 11% APR at the moment which will reduce to 4% in 2016 when the next block halving is timed to happen.
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:51:19
I might be out of the loop on this but are you sure about this millisatoshi fee?  I'm not sure how that's even possible given a satoshi is the smallest unit bitcoin can describe.  I remember reading about achieving sub-satoshi values by probability techniques but never heard about this making it into LN protocol (and seemed rather ropey anyhow).
Any reference would be greatly appreciated as I can't see how this would be done.
@_date: 2015-04-24 09:13:32
Who knows, it's certainly not going to stay at $200/btc though... either they'll be some flaw we've not seen yet that will plummet it to $0 or it's going to continue to rise.
With 11% inflation going on at the moment the price is holding up remarkably well, next year when inflation drops to 4% will have a dramatic effect as people will be able to see it as a store of value better than some fiats... right now it's pure speculation.

So some FUD and some facts...
Bitcoin does not use SHA256 for encryption, it uses it for Proof of work and for hashing.  It can not be easily upgraded, it would be the most contentious fork to date given how much dedicated hardware is out there running SHA256(SHA256(x)) algorithms.
It is true that CNSA is now saying SHA256 is not fit for documents classified as secret which is intriguing but remember they err on the side of caution.  As I understand it this has nothing to do with QC however since it's all about bit shifting, it could however be because it's been proven to have a collision which would demonstrate it is no longer resilient for document integrity purposes.  It does not mean SHA256 is broken though.
Next QC may well put ECDSA public keys at risk, it is a matter of 'when' not 'if'.  Just look at charts of QC cubit counts increasing and you can see this is on the horizon.  It's not blackmagic, it's physics and it works but right now it's dog slow (at least the QCs we know about in comparison to regular digital computers)
We therefore need to start looking at including new OP codes to support new signatures now or in a side chain to start migrating after the first public demonstration of a QC deriving a private key from a public one.  
These new OP_CODES can easily co-exist with existing 256bit ECDSA that bitcoin uses and easy to upgrade due to segwit being enabled I believe.  We could also address the fungibility concerns that will inevitably hinder bitcoin in time too.
256bit ECDSA would have to be absolutely smashed to break a realtime tx to decode the private key and reissue a new tx within the time it takes to find the next block.  I.e. this is very unlikely to happen in the next decade IMHO.  It's most likely it will show it can be cracked with months of hammering one tx which still has funds in the public key address.
I.e. this article seems to be highlighting two other coins attempting to make steps to protect against QC which is great and we should be giving some attention to this in bitcoin too but it's very far from bitcoin being even remotely hacked yet.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:02:32
It's only if 99% of miners were disconnected that could cause that sort of delay but that would be like the Internet going down worldwide and would only be as long as the interruption took, no adjustment would be required. Any miner, even if a massive one, losing their connection won't really effect confirmation times that much and as soon as they're back online the instantly they reconnect with everyone else, almost no catchup time.  Might be what you mean anyhow but just being clear for others if there was any misinterpreting... Ie it's not an issue even if the worst case scenario were to happen magically somehow.  It's pretty darn robust :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 10:28:07
Agreed, I'm not saying bitcoin's valuation is a lovely smooth graph for relatively short term storage but whilst it's guaranteed 11% inflation only speculators would be interested in investing in bitcoin until the next halving.
After the next halving a limited 4% inflation rate could attract a different type of user (long term investor) if the experiment continues the growing adoption rate.
I'm sure we'll see more bubbles and bursts in the coming years but averaging them out over many years my current feeling is it'll outperform many fiat savings accounts after this point but who knows, only time will tell.

1. No, not at the moemnt.
2. No.  Bitcoin hasn't created these markets, they existed well before Bitcoin and will continue to exist with or without bitcoin.  Actually other cryptocurrencies are better suited for illicit purposes as bitcoin is actually quite transparent on transactions.
3. It's transferable instantaneously, irrefutable, global usage, with virtually no fees.  It's the first digital asset people can own without a 3rd party being involved and the asset can't be copied or created out of thin air.  The supply is globally known, predictable and finite at just under 21,000,000.00000000 units.  Anyone can now make programs to interact with real money without needing to rely on a bank or 3rd party.
4. Yes, large transactions such as a recent gov sending $14,000,000+ in seconds with paying $0.04 in fees is an example of this.
5. Right now it's main use is in exchange (i.e. you buy/sell the bitcoins almost instantly and thereby ignoring any volatility).  There is a lot of speculation the growing userbase will continue as it is... more demand, less supply means the value will appreciate even though they are currently experiencing 11% inflation due to the mining rewards of 25BTC every 10 minutes.
6. You don't need to be a three letter organization to track bitcoin transactions live as they happen, here's a screensaver that shows them live if you'd really like.    (You read the transaction from the top being the amount followed by the address it is sent to).
7. Time will tell but given it's a global phenomena regulation will likely only be there to help it's nation's citizens in knowing what is a reputable entity and controlling the on/off ramps to local fiat currencies.  Attempts to suppress or stifle digital currencies via regulation merely put that country at a disadvantage globally since pioneering businesses will be based in the more welcoming countries thereby becoming the market leaders for the new services it brings.

I believe QC's are rubbish at rounds of gate logic manipulation so SHA256 is not going to be cracked with the invention of QCs.
That said, ECDSA is at risk from a QC so eventually it may be prudent adding a new signature system to the bitcoin scripts. 
 Until universities have access to a 50+ cubit QC it is unlikely we will know what is actually safe.
Luckily bitcoin uses hashes of public keys to accept payments so as long as you've not reused addresses the funds can be considered very safe still.  Also it's very unlikely a QC would be able to break an ECDSA private key within the time a new block is produced which would be needed for it to be used in a malicious way.

   he could deny it... Meaning he doesn't want people to know. Any sensible person would do this for their own safety and safety of their friends and family.
If he isn't Satoshi
   He could say he is, but would need to have an upside for the downside risk (e.g. some financial gain like proving he had billions of dollars in collateral to for a tax scheme)
   He could deny it, because it isn't him.

Not sure why your comment was down voted as you make a good point about coercion which should be carefully considered.
That said, digital doesn't require the trust of the equipment maker... it's the beauty of asymmetric cryptography.  You probably know this but for the benefit of others still learning it...
If you pick a very big random number (lets say it's 1234 where in practice these are 40 digit numbers for bitcoin) , it's now your private key that only you know.  
With a bit of maths magic you can derive another number from this private key which is the matching public key to that private key (let's say it gives the result of your public key is 8348).     
Now you have your text like "I vote for ABC" convert this to a single number via hashing and say this text sentence gives you the has number of  31112.  With that hash number you combine it with your private key to get the signature value of say 558855.
Now you share your text, your public key number(8348) and your signature number(558855) to the world.  People can take your text, run the same hash function to get the same hash value you did of 31112.  Now the magic bit is they can take your signature value(558855) and your public key(8348) value and when combined it gives you the same 31112 hash number... i.e. your public key + signature = hash of the text. 
This can not be reverse engineered so only if you know that private key number(1234), which you've never shared or published anywhere, can you create the public key and signature values that match the text published.   This is irrefutable proof that you wrote that text/cast that vote.  
I know I've oversimplified the signing process but the principal is exactly this and why open electronic signatures are vastly more secure than our old paper approaches.

Yes, so if 1 billion were in a pool they'd each receive 0.000000025 BTC each.
Firstly bitcoin has an atomic unit called satoshi... there is nothing smaller.  There are 100,000,000 satoshi's in 1 bitcoin so the pool operator could send 0.00000002 however this is below the dust limit miners accept so would probably be ignored if sent (to prevent spamming).
Many of these pools however keep a central address that would store the accumulating 25bitcoin rewards and simply tell the miners they can withdraw 0.000000025 btc + whatever balance they had before allowing them to give more precision.
As the amount the miner earns accumulates to a more significant value the miner can now opt to withdraw their bitcoin balance from this pool's central bitcoin wallet to their own bitcoin address.
As you've said though, it costs money to mine... both in electrical costs, maintenance, repayment of hardware/depreciation, etc.. therefore to mine you need to be earning enough btc to cover these costs... this equilibrium is a beautiful balancing act that shows as the value of a bitcoin increases it becomes more viable to put more mining power in which in turn makes the blockchain more secure.  If the value drops, miners drop out until equilibrium is reached again.  The bitcoin network autocalibrates so that regardless to how many people and how fast the machines hash, it still targets 10 minutes on average to find a solution and reward those 25btc to someone.

@_date: 2015-09-20 19:40:36
Depends what you mean...
A transaction is confirmed when it's included in a block that is added to the blockchain.
On average it takes 10 minutes but is an average, sometimes it can take 40 mins sometimes in can take less than 1 minute... 
There is no way to speed this up in the protocol except by starting another coin, litecoin's protocol for example aims for 2.5 minutes I think? 
Also you need to get your transaction picked up by a miner to be included. This is usually a case of including a small fee like 0.0001btc to provide its not a spam transaction just clogging the system.
Your wallet provider (blockchain.info) does this for you.
When the network is at full capacity, higher prority transactions are included at the expense of lower priority ones. So far this has only occurred during some stress tests that last a day or so.
I don't think blockchain.info allows you to tweak the miner fee so you just have to wait until the network catches up.
Btw priority isn't just mining fee, it's also the value of the transfer and time the coins were last moved.
Other wallets like greenaddress.it offer instant transactions between bitcoin wallets as they use a multisig system so you can be certain the funds have not been spent. There are other ways to do it too but just remember you're seeing bitcoin raw and as it matures the layers on top will hide these low level workings :)
Btw I'd highly recommended trying another wallet like mycelium as blockchain.info is great to start isn't using the recent improvements like HD wallets that simplify backing up.

One "simple" project that I don't think exists yet...
Allow you to put a bitcoin address to receive a payment on.  When a payment is made to the address it creates a transaction to forward this payment on to the main holding address... using Websocket (or just AJAX polling if you're doing PHP) you can query the PHP page to see if payment to a given address has been made yet.
Doing this in Node and bitcoinjs would be ideal as this seems quite popular but with PHP it should be possible too.
Having this simple open source script would help many people who want to identify payments in but want to collate payments to a single address.

"FB, you need to pay your taxes"
"Ah, ok, we will just increase supply and pay you out of that?"
"Ur, no.  You have to pay us without increasing supply. Our local currency only please"
"Ok, we will have to exclude transactions in your country until you let us"
"Well we will make our own sovereign coin"
"Sure, but we will ban any country that accepts your coin due to KYC issues, you know to be safe"

So they can own it... Block chains allow for a degree of safety but a private blockchain is inherently less secure than bitcoin's chain for most purposes.
I heard one comment by a notable author saying 'who's going to trust remote miners in China to handle their transaction ledger!' 
IMHO it's that sort of gross misunderstanding of the Bitcoin technology why some try making a private chain but those of us actually coding come to realise Bitcoin is vastly more suitable.

ECB M1 value is €8,000billion, they are adding €20billion/month = 0.0025% per month
(1 + 0.0025) \^ 12 months = 1.0304  
**i.e. they're simply forcing devaluation/inflation of the euro to 3% per year.**  
It's not that crazy, it's kind of what central banks are supposed to do.  
The crazy bit is people aren't taught this in school.  People with funds typically have financial advisors who know this and move funds out of bank accounts into other assets.  Bitcoin is merely another asset to diversify to these days and has potential upside beyond stocks, shares, commodities since it is designed for precisely this.

It seems a great idea but I am slightly nervous they could operate a fractional banking system under the hood given only they hold the private keys to the funds or the assets themselves.
These guys may be a perfect candidate to show why regulation is apparently needed but I don't want them to form fill just to get an arbitrary license, I'd much prefer they optionally pay a trusted independent service to come in, audit them, explain if they are 100% backed or a fractional banking system at the time of audit, what level of security features they use and if they get a good enough result go on this organisation's accreditation list for a year.
As a developer and a business owner I'd be more than happy to start this optional open accreditation standard if I could find the funding from someone to do it.  I'd aim to make the accreditation go into another decentralized blockchain (namecoin) so everyone has access to accreditations made, provable it's genuine and maintain a full history whilst at the same time allowing others to do this service too to avoid a monopoly..

If losing 33btc is devastating financially you may like to consider selling it immediately.  BTC is new and unproven and no one here can say for certain how it's going to play out in the long run so only risk what you can afford to lose... that said I think 33btc is a small amount to have invested in something that is potentially vast.  We're yet to see any other digital currency command such a high valuation and more importantly remain high.
Yes it's been dropping in exchange value for the last few years, yes it's disheartening and scary if you've put it in as pure investment expecting the price to continue rocketing, and yes it is still very early days in this market. 
One of many things could trigger the next spike, my hunch is when lightning network is made **and simple to use** this will see a price jump by techies speculating and pushing it internally where they work.  This is going to be the critical moment for technical adoption, until that we're hampered with TX/second so I for one am actively wanting it to NOT go mainstream until this is ready so the next wave of adoption is smooth.
That said, something else is more likely to happen before this.  It could well be the next financial dip like 2008 (we're due it on the historical 8 year cycle).  If the dip is hard people will frantically try to invest in anything that isn't losing value (i.e. taking money out of bank accounts, out of stocks and shared and investing in commodities/property/tangible goods/etc).  Now bitcoin is a choice available this is likely to gain at least a small % of that flow... that part scares me a little since it'll be another boom/bust cycle so may do more harm than good in the short term.
Another possibility is one of the larger names starts using it... PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, Amex, WU... as soon as one accepts btc as a two way currency it will quickly own that market share from their competitors so they will need to act very quickly to catchup likely to cause a massive surge in demand to the limited supply again.
Guess what I'm saying is, unless there is a better decentralised digital currency coming along, bitcoin is still vastly ahead of anything else and my views on why it can command a high valuation haven't changed.

I do wish Asha would pop into this and let people help write a more balanced article rather than scaremongering with long gone historical headlines.  Firstly that note was NOT about security, bitcoin remains as secure as it ever was... the note was about scalability and openness.
Intentionally or not, she seems to dwell on old negative articles (MtGox that stole people's bitcoin that occurred many years ago but still dragging on, the SilkRoad mess simply because it was one site that happened to use bitcoin).
She's overlooked all the more recent positives such as Expedia, Microsoft, Dell, Overstock getting on board with it and doing well.  NASDAQ, Barclays, UBS, Citi, BnP and other banks also racing to be the first to do something of significance with it, the legitimacy of exchanges world wide and ETFs being launched... not to mention all the new businesses that are being built around bitcoin's protocol to enable safer online payment systems.

Not sure if this is the right approach or not but I've recently started pointing out to people that SR was merely an international site that needed a global payment system.  If bitcoin hadn't existed they have easily used another payment system like direct P2P payments, indirect P2P2P payments, micropayment companies, cash in an envelope, commodity trading, virtual currencies in games/messaging apps, custom private currencies, etc..
I.e. SR was just a notorious website that happened to use only bitcoin for payments, the payment mechanism itself wasn't responsible for that site existing.

* Allows sharing up an address that funds can only be sent to.  Totally secure for the internet when compared to bank accounts, paypal, credit cards.
* Designed for the internet
* Instant transfer anywhere in the world.
* Allow computers and companies to not just accept payments but to accrue stored value to spend later. (E.g. today I saw a bot being tipped and accepting the money)
* Optional transparency able on payments (Public records, expenditure on projects)
* Multisignature systems to allow for escrow and contracts to enable smarter ways to pay for items over the "goods for money swap system".  I.e. now payments can reach the seller only once the goods reach the buyer without needing trust.
* Micropayment systems and other layers can be built on top easily. (E.g. wifi micropayments)
* A trusted ledger that can't be gamed to see certain historical proof. (Legal documents, accounts)
* Represent shares in a company (Overstock)
* Offers a store of value accessible globally like investing in any other finite commodity
* 24/7 uptime for share trading
* Irrefutable proof of documents/files/data existing at a given time that can't be altered.
* Is the first protocol to send actual value over the internet enabling a new market of internet services.

A blockchain offers 2 things....
A degree of security in preventing history from being maliciously rewritten because you need to use (almost) the same amount of energy that has gone into the system since the item was added to your database.
The other is it allows a method for anyone to anonymously append transactions to the database assuming the rules you specify are adhered to.
The big misconception however is when is a private blockchain helpful.  For security in being unable to rewrite history you generally want the most energy, strongest chain approach, anything else is a sticky plaster security approach.  The strongest chain is clearly bitcoin's blockchain  (we're talking thousands of times more powerful than even a very large private company could offer (nearly $1million per day running costs) ) and personally I wouldn't trust anything else right now as it's bigger than anything by vast orders of magnitude.
The anonymously appending transactions is also a specific usecase that most companies don't need.  It typically is only helpful if you want your database to be public, not private otherwise you can use cheaper, faster, more scalable databases that are already widely used.
Bitcoin's blockchain essentially is the only one I'd trust for transferring real value or anything where an immutable history is required.  If you do find the niche where a private blockchain is somehow appropriate I'd still tie it to bitcoin anyhow since you have so much security with it than anything that can be made in house.
I.e. the whole 'blockchain not bitcoin' is merely a PR line due to bitcoin's brand issue and most people are actually talking about bitcoin when they say blockchain.  The few exceptions I can think of to this would be alt coins that do something different to Bitcoin (e.g. Ethereum, Namecoin, Factom, etc)

I tend to agree about why did they burn the btc but someone tried explaining it at a meetup as proof no one is profiting from creating the coin itself. At the time I didn't get it but now seeing the neucoin approach I think burning for a pos system shows its not just a scam.
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:50:42
There's no precise figure but the system aims for a confirmation to take 10 minutes on average (I.e. it aims for 2016 confirmations to happen over a 2 week period)
That said, 1 confirmation can take anywhere from a few seconds to an hour... it merely depends on when a miner guesses a number that produces a valid solution for the current difficulty rating of the network.
So typically 6 confirmations should take an hour but could equally take 6 hours if miners have some bad luck or could take 10 minutes if they're really lucky.
If you want instant confirmations you need to use greenaddress systems or micropayment channels.
@_date: 2015-09-10 09:25:05
I think we're heading towards free transactions again but we need Lightning network or similar approach to achieve this.
When this happens however the fees will be subsidised by selling your transaction information to other companies that will be interested in it.
For instance, one scenario is one of the major payment providers (e.g. a debit card) adopts bitcoin as a currency.  Now you can buy and sell everything with bitcoin through them.  However when they have a transaction between two users who are both in their own closed system they can settle that transaction instantly without fees to the customer and sell that transaction info to another company like an equifax equivalent.
Ultimately bitcoin is nothing more than a very robust solid commodity to back transactions with.  It gives tangible value in a virtual world of fiats and bank accounts which lack a commodity value.
I.e. it'll happen but you'll pay for the service either in btc fees or someone else will pay the fees for you in exchange for snooping on what you're doing.

Not smarter but many more years of experience can help navigate sensible blockchain choices.  Perhaps they have a good reason for a private chain like solving scalability, done as a side chain or introduced a feature not possible in bitcoins chain... 
Only if they made an alt because it seemed 'safer' would I question the experience used in the decision.

"Blockchain technology" is a buzz word like "Cloud computing"... whilst there is the true technical meaning many use it to describe a linear irreversible database.  
So one such tweak is to make mining with SHA(SHA(x)) something like SHA(SHA(x)+1).  This breaks all ASICs out there so puts their new chain on level pegging.  If IBM or whoever make the asics for this new algorithm you can be sure the data is locked tightly.  The amount of $'s to spend on this new chain mining is precisely how much money it would cost to corrupt that data. 
This is indeed a useful invention in certain scenarios (think voting machines where provable history is required)... but those who work with security already realize that it's vastly more cost effective to use bitcoin's blockchain rather than start and maintain a new one.  
The people working on these alt chains are bound to be very smart and will realize blockchain technology is best suited to 'one chain to rule them all' so expect they're talking about these generic blockchains as proof of concept and eventually migrate to the strongest decentralized chain in future where bitcoin is still vastly ahead of anything else... time will tell in this experiment.

Agreed, it is a bit extreme given day to day most of us will never experience this but it only is relevant when it is too late. (Eg Cyprus)
Bank runs happen all the time and 2008 was dangerous because it was so toxic to the other financial institutions. It should have been allowed to fail but the consequences were worse than national bailouts and kicking the bucket down the road to slowly wind fractional banking back. I have yet to see any evidence this has happened but Im happy to hear otherwise. 
It seems a typical ‘tradgedy of the commons’ problem where it almost certainly will happen in the next generation and is vastly worse than what would have happened in 2008 if the banks had collapsed because more controls would be put in place.  
Banks outgoings exceed their income if fractional banking is stopped.  This must be true because you are getting a free magic service somehow. That means banks are spending more than they can afford and eventually the reserve ratio limit will be reached again by one large bank and 2008 happens all over again.
In many countries they have changed to bailins first so I doubt the funds are meaningfully protected anymore since your funds would first be used to prevent the bank failing.  If you live in one of those countries you can only claim that money back if the bank fails I believe. Again depends where you live and happy to hear if this is not the case in your state/country.

Good question,
I expect it would obscure what the value transferred to a different owner for the duration of that transaction but future transactions would probably group together these change addresses so if someone was really determined they could probably figure out who owned them (at least by a reasonable degree of probability).
The disadvantage is it increases the transaction size so may incur larger mining fees and a larger block size.
As for wallet implementation side I expect this would only be helpful to HD wallets as with traditional wallets like bitcoind you'd end up with the risk that backups get out of date much faster so a good chance people would lose funds on restoring a backup where &gt; 100 return addresses have been used.
If using an HD wallet however it doesn't reduce the risk of the hack since they'd still be after that seed key and have access to all the funds in the various addresses.

Ultimately your pc will likely have a connection history to the hacker and with authorities involved they can help extract these and potentially identify who it is at this stage.

I had a similar experience with a client yesterday.  They were charged 12% in fees by the banks to send $2500 internationally and took 5 business days to arrive.
I explained if we used the bitcoin network (i.e. they wouldn't even see bitcoin, just use circle or something) they would be completed within seconds at $0.03 fee.  Now to be fair it would take some time for them to create their bitcoin account but it's still faster than the banks could do this one off payment.
Their management didn't want to use it because it's new and unorthodox and would rather pay the bank 12% fee! 
This was a disappointing response and shows why there is a massive niche in the market for a credible financial institution to sweep up remittance by simply offering their trusted name as a service when under the hood it uses bitcoin instead of clearing houses.

Yes, it is possible but controls are currently required.  
* You need to know the vote was not done under duress.  One solution is to allow people to change their minds and revote somehow... perhaps by using something like the nLockTime to allow votes to be cast just before the deadline and every change of vote is simply a transaction with nLockTime-1?
* If it needs to be anonymous voting the voter still needs to be able to verify their vote was part of the finally tally.  This probably requires trusting the centralized voting authority to keep the voters information secure.  This should be independently verifiable by statistical sample testing voters to make sure they received a unique voting ID, ensuring their votes were included in the final tally.
* Also would need a way for people to vote saying they were not free to vote.  This way if people feel the poll was unfair they can at least voice this opinion in a visible way.
* The chain needs to be secure, currently only Bitcoin and Litecoin's chains are strong enough to believe this.  A sudden spike in hashing power would be pretty obvious the vote was being gamed.
There are other issues too but overall yes I believe the bitcoin blockchain is certainly a great technology for voting with a bit of thought.

They might say that UK exchanges have to use the BoE to buy/sell GBP to give the issuing bank direct control over any capital flight risks or issues should bank runs happen in future.  TBH the UK is one of the strongest economies so seems unlikely they'd need that overhead but weaker economies like Venezuela might consider doing something like this to prop up their currency.
Of course it would only be applicable to law abiding citizens, anyone who wanted to circumvent that because of nefarious reasons is still able to and not sure what anyone can really do to prevent it.

Couldn't agree more.  A PoW change to the most secure chain is simply astounding to even consider.  The only time I'd consider it sensible is if bitcoin transactions were being openly censored.
E.g. Here is a valid bitcoin trasactions 0xa.....34575 that can not be published on the network because any block it goes in keeps getting orphaned.
When that happens that's when we know bitcoin PoW needs to be changed.
To do so any earlier is insanity.  If a PoW system can improve on the SHA256 approach simply start a new cryptocoin and people will adopt it on technical merit if it's better than Bitcoin's.  For that reason changing the gold standard coin's main security design that risks everyone's funds will never be accepted unless bitcoin was clearly compromised.

When importing the key to electrum did you import the one that starts with a 1.... Or a 5... ?
My guess would be you've imported your address which is just able to receive funds in (ie totally safe to share)
The 5... Is your private key that is used to derive the 1.... Address so you need to export your private key from bitcoind to import to electrum.
(Google is your friend but I think it's something like dumpprivkey with the address)
If you have imported the 5.... And only getting watch only you may prefer using Mycelium and using the cold storage option... Otherwise just wait for bitcoind to sync (check you have enough disk space as needs around 50gb I think + swapspace while syncing)

Who knows the future and I can't say if he's right or wrong but I'd like to look at the evidence.
Bitcoin is still around so what will make it disappear in future that hasn't happened before?
The only possibilities I can think of are 
- something better comes along to displace it
- there's a fundamental flaw we've yet to notice
- a crackdown by every nation thereby driving it underground and preventing mainstream adoption.
The latter is unlikely since the crackdown approach merely hinders that nation being involved with the legitimate uses of bitcoin whilst the small number of nefarious uses they'd be trying to curb would continue anyhow (probably with a more obscure harder to track coin though).
The fundamental flaw is feasible and scalability is looking a technical hurdle that must be surmounted to succeed in wide spread adoption.  I'm quite positive about this at the moment since layers on top of bitcoin can easily solve this and perhaps it's sidechains or perhaps it's LN or perhaps something else... all can potentially enable vast numbers of transactions with bitcoin's backing.
Something better comes along... this is a real possibility.  If BitcoinV2 is created where scalability is solved from the outset or another key feature is added before bitcoin can include it this becomes a viable bitcoin replacement.  My hunch is development on Bitcoin is far faster than any alt currency so again whilst feasible if the banking IT depts put their heads together for an open source version it seems far fetched a more secure and trusted open source unit of value will appear on the internet.
Would love to hear any other reasons bitcoin could potentially disappear as for me it seems bitcoin is going to be gaining ground for a long time to come.

I've never once heard anyone argue it's dangerous.  I've heard it's a bubble, ponzi, associated to nefarious uses or a very high risk investment... never dangerous though. 
Appears a rather misguided view to use such a word given security is one of bitcoin's advantages over traditional payment systems.  Will be interesting to see how long they keep up with the 'ignore it and it'll go away' approach.  Surely if the most powerful exchange handling 80% of transactions disappeared overnight yet the network still continues to grow with larger and larger corporations getting involved they should realize there must be a good reason for this.
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:54:04


No, you can be assured that hasn't happened.  A transaction typically only contains your public key, the destination address and a signature number.  The signature is derived from your private key + random number + the destination address you're sending the funds to... i.e. if someone changed that destination address they'd have to create a new signature for it to be valid.  They'd only be able to recalculate a valid signature if they know your private key number (that bread wallet *never* transmits).
Do you not even see the transaction in the transaction list?
I'd contact bread for some help, failing that, make sure you have your backup pass phrase/keyword list and simply reinstall the app on another device (or backup your iOS device, delete the app, reinstall) and recover your wallet from your backup phrase.  
Sounds like there's a bug in picking up invalid transactions so definitely worth contacting Bread so they know to fix it.

There's a lot to cover here but nothing to worry about.
To fill the blocks at current levels I expect it's around $200-$400 every 10 minutes.  I.e. $30,000/day.
Firstly it's quite a lot of money to spend on a temporary annoyance.  Also it means people can still have their transactions happen, just it costs more money so they would pay more, so the attack costs more and so on.  When this attack was tried with the bcash split it was in the region of \~$1.2m / day in today's money spent in fees to attack the network and still didn't stop important transactions getting through.
I.e. this attack just didn't work and was expensive for the attacker.  They could however manipulate the market with co-ordinated media coverage which may temporarily lower the price and recoup their costs as people freak out of ever escalating fees.  I think it's getting harder and harder to do this though.
Regarding LN, there are pros and cons in using LN.  It is fast, instantly confirmed, virtually no fees.  However it has it's drawbacks too.  It ties up funds, it is difficult to use, it isn't widely accepted, both parties need to be online at the same time, you can get channel exhaustion issues that are very difficult to understand.   
Basically LN has it's purpose and use cases, it isn't however a replacement or competitor to onchain transactions, merely an optimisation that works in some scenarios like general light spending.

Whilst you're right that a 64bit int can store this value, it's more that a standard IEEE 64bit float with the 52bit fraction part fits the 21 million ( x 10 ^ 8 ) into this with a little bit of extra head room to allow for additions to be handled precisely.
i.e. 2 ^ 52 = 45,035,996.27370496 bitcoin.

Try don't own it at all, if they credit themselves with 100btc their block is still ignored by the network. Equally they can do little harm except decide which transactions they will accept, if they are malicious and don't accept them the next pool to win would.
If too many are malicious the code base is updated to reject selfish miners... That's not happened yet merely because it's not a problem.

You can pick a very big number (your private key) and from this you can do some maths to derive the public key number (which basically looks like an unrelated random number).  With the public key number you can create a bitcoin address we all know and love.  
Going backwards for any of those steps is considered impossible by todays technology.
A bitcoin address however is simply a string of numbers and letters which has a checksum in it to make sure it's been typed correctly.  You can therefore create a random bitcoin address and just work out what the checksum digits/letters need to be without knowing what private key number would generate it.
If you therefore make a bitcoin address 1yourmessagegoesherexxxxxxxxx{checksum} for instance, the chances anyone has gone through all the private keys to find one that generates this bitcoin address is virtually impossible as it would take a very long time to find an address with a mere 6 letters you wanted in it nevermind 10+ letters.
For this reason you can see 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE where the checksum 59kuE has been added to make it valid is pretty darn certain no one can spend those funds as no one will have the private key to unlock it.

Whilst I think bitskeptic's response is the best answer, if you ever need someone just to get up and running about bitcoin and not worry about which wallet to use you can give them this smart link which detects their device and takes them to the most popular app or website for that device...  (bread wallet-iOS, mycelium-Android, PC/Mac-Electrum)
Just simplifies things as there are a sea of wallets out there.
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:46:51
A wallet merely holds the private keys (ie passwords/large number) for each address you control on the global blockchain database.  Depending on the wallet it stores each private key or it is an HD wallet which is easier and only needs to store the single key/number all of your addresses/private keys can be calculated from.
When spending from a wallet it will try to spend from any of the addresses you've received funds to... Whilst there are rules to figure it out it's best just to think of each address like a travellers cheque that must be cashed in entirely and you typically want to receive change to a new address. You can send change back to the same source address but is frowned upon now in order to ensure future security.

I disagree, he didn't do anything that insane.  Yes in retrospect you can see how it's avoidable but equally this stuff just isn't easy to keep safe and must be simplified for the masses because this is computer literate people still getting robbed.  It needs to be better otherwise we are inviting trusted 3rd parties to handle peoples coins which will lead to the same issues we have with centralised payment systems and defeats the whole purpose.
We can't have 0.01% of the population know how to use bitcoin while 99.99% get robbed, if we don't fix it another coin will.
I personally would like some protocol enhancements to allow for an OP_HODL or something like this... (These are most likely rubbish ideas, just thinking out loud to see if people smarted than me can actually find a decent solution)
* OP code that allowed a tx to happen only after X blocks have passed without any cancelling tx being issued.  This would allow people to lock funds away and when they go to redeem them there is an 'undo' period should someone hijack the tx.  It would also allow for services looking for unauthorised transactions to automatically issue a cancel transaction if the user doesn't confirm it was them.
* Ability to limit max amount transferred from a tx in each block by paying a fee to miners.  If miners find a tx from a tagged tx, they can collect the bounty/reward to block the tx and issue a 'safe move' tx in the block instead.

This sounds good advice.
To eliminate the culprit being up task manager and kill each task one by one, attempting  to copy paste your address in notepad each time.
This will probably be unfruitful but needed as a first pass should you be running some compromised exe.
Next run hijackthis to see what is run in startup, save this log.  Kill any Explorer extensions, any runonce/startup processes and reboot. Now try copy/paste again, is it fixed.  If so please share your log file with the community who can help identify the culprit.
If still no joy, run typical virus scanners and see if any of these fix it after reboot.
One last step, check a windows repair fixes it. If the issue still exists this would highlight a serious exploit but I doubt it will get to this.  Should this happen it could be something deeply rooted in startup or even worse.  I'm sure the virus companies would like to analyse it more regardless and sharing as much as you can safely share would be really helpful to the community.
My hunch is its an Explorer extension exploit from some dodgy exe mainly because this seems the easiest explanation for such an attack.

Think of it like a lottery... every 10 minutes someone wins 25BTC.  The more people who enter it the less chance you have of winning that 25BTC.
Most people use pools just like lottery pools to smooth out the long periods of not earningn anything where the pool operators share the winnings (the 25BTC) if someone in their pool wins.
So to answer your question, even if a trillion people mine only 1 lucky person would still get the 25BTC.  If that happened to be a pool operator they'd share the 25BTC amongst their pool contributors.
As for the price impact, mining doesn't really drive the bitcoin price at all, more the other way around.

Whilst I agree it seems a bit like that story of the guy who starved to death even when he kept finding fish jumping in his boat because his deity would save him.  Later the deity says 'I gave you all those fish and you still died?'.  Ok, I'm not really a religious guy but this is what's going on here.  There are laws to help prevent spam attacks on the network, why the heck isn't it right to prosecute people trying to intentionally disrupt a global network used by other businesses?
Yes the network will cope and survive but service during these tests is hurt simply because the network isn't fast enough yet... it will be eventually so is a pointless annoying test.
The issue here is there is nothing on the cards to prevent a spam attack if someone is willing to pay for it.  Unless a proposal to fix this type of attack the 'test' is just annoying and could very easily be argued as illegal to fine the assholes who are doing it on the live network.
Put it on testnet if it's a test.  Put it on the live network when you think the live network will handle it gracefully.

As others have pointed out this isn't representative of Bitcoin actually being used usefully yet, on the other side however it is true that it does represent that much money has safely 'moved' via bitcoin.
My gripe with this however is it's not comparing the important stats yet.  It's like comparing car's wheel rotation rates, yes it's important that the wheels go around but it's more about distance travelled, acceleration, comfort, etc..
The amount of money 'moved' in bitcoin is not an important metric, it should be about how useful the payment is.
Until bitcoin scalability is shown to be solved by easy use, comparing btc to those other smallpayments systems is meaningless IMHO.

I know get be misunderstanding your question here but I believe of transactions increase we can get block saturation so only the transactions with the highest fees make that 1mb block.
A linear growth can be helped by increasing max block size and can reach 32mb before to keep transaction fees low. 
Beyond that code fixes are needed but it can still go larger in a linear fashion.
Scaling for faster adoption requires a layer on top such as centralised services, sidechains or lightning networks from what I understand.
Lightning Network certainly seems a great concept with the main worry being it's going to take time to get easy to use libraries that work on javascript, php, java, c and the user level wallets on ios/android/Web/pc/mac that support it, all are needed before it is feasible in mass adoption.
As for a BIP, no I'm not aware of one since none are a silver bullet by themselves.

It is currently inflationary... and this inflation is not insignificant which amazes me it's constantly ignored.
There are around 14,000,000 coins in circulation with 3600 new coins produced a day in mining which gives around a 10.65% increased supply rate.  If markets were ignored this gives a very clear inflationary currency, it is merely obscured due to the peaks and troughs of market conditions.  
The algorithm indicates next year the mining reward is looking set to be halved so inflation will drop to a much more familiar 4% rate.  This will be fascinating to economists as it starts becoming a better store of value than many fiats in the world.

Incredible no one is suggesting ApplePay may eventually just adopt bitcoin as a currency.  With Apple/Google as the trusted 3rd party the transactions would inevitably be offchain and allow vast scaling, instant settlement, allow for AML/KYC better than any bank can.
Before doing this they'd have to allow P2P payments with Apple pay/Googlepay.
I'd almost bet Apple will pick just one Visa or MC to work with to introduce bitcoin and ditch the other because neither is going to be too pleased about the adoption. 
 Would almost replace the competition and Apple could turn into a bank itself doing fractional bitcoin banking and essentially run the global economy in a matter of a few years if they collaborated with Google.

If less people sell, supply reduces and the price will indeed go up as economics 101 explains.
There is a caveat though, this will only happen as long as other people are still using and spending bitcoin.  Without actually using bitcoin it's value would be diminished to pure speculation form so less would want to buy it if it was rare to be traded... with blocks filling up it's obvious bitcoin is being used more and more.
Just for correctness, the reward rate is per 10 mins on avg so it's 12.5btc x 6 = 75 new bitcoin per hour are introduced to the system at the moment.

There are two answers here... one for real bitcoin on the blockchain and the other for MtGox.
The distinction is that MtGox was effectively a bank and without people's knowledge they operated a fractional bank.  
This meant if you added up all the bitcoin in the customers accounts it was less than the bitcoin they actually owned as seen on the blockchain.  I expect originally their total customers bitcoin balances summed to their bitcoin reserves however over time these diverged.  MtGox originally claimed it was due to a bug in their wallet code whereby a hacker was withdrawing money from MtGox onto the blockchain but the attacker duplicated the transaction and modifying the transaction ID that mtgox used as a tag.  This was a pretty sophisticated attack but was known to be possible and boils down to their wallet software simply didn't pick this up so internally they thought the funds hadn't been paid out at a guess allowing the hacker to rinse and repeat.  I'd also expect the attack wouldn't work every time since they would have to issue an identical transaction once MtGox issued theirs and was a race condition on which transaction would enter the blockchain. 
So for these coins you'd expect MtGox should have become aware of this hack very quickly and knew exactly who was doing it based on their financial controls.  (Historical records would also point the finger at the culprit too).  It's likely this wasn't the only issue in MtGox by the sounds of reddit reports.  There was potentially also embezzlement, intentional or not, and if the customer funds were stored with the company's own funds they're likely spent due to Gox's operating costs.
So for those coins it's not even clear which ones were 'stolen' since they were legitimately signed by MtGox's wallet to another address.  If true, in time it's likely to be identified but only MtGox staff with their records could answer this.
Once real bitcoin enter the blockchain now we're into the realm of the public paper trail.
Chasing coins through the blockchain is difficult when mixers are involved, especially fixed size mixers and if the thief knows what they're doing.  Every mixer simply dilutes the coin's history so it becomes a probability game on where the funds went.  The more clients and even the mixing the harder it can be to follow for relatively small amounts.
The most likely reason to catch someone post mixing is probably due to a sidechannel give away such as the timings, the mixer is actually run by someone wanting to track people, spending habits of the resulting coins (like going straight to a russian crypto exchange post mixing) or association with other coins.  At the moment this isn't a science but the tools are getting better.
Ultimately tracing the coins is a costly (in person hours) exercise so only when it's of significant interest will they be followed up on.
In some ways this is a good thing as it makes the default "innocent until proven guilty" approach even though it feels wrong when people can see the coins should belong to someone else.  Anyhow I think MtGox will eventually be explained but while it's still in the process of examination I doubt we'll hear the details of precisely which transactions are responsible.
In summary... the coins are most likely no longer in the attackers wallet and in general circulation as part of the bitcoin ecosystem otherwise the thief is simply sitting on them in various addresses until they want to move them in the years to come.  
Either way the coins still most certainly exist on the blockchain somewhere ;)

The highest end CPU will get you at most 20MHashes if you're lucky.  In the background on an average computer you're talking probably more like 0.1MH but let's be generous and say 1MHash.
1 ASIC is 1,000,000x faster.... and there are hundreds of thousands of ASICs out there powering bitcoin, precisely 410,000,000,000 MHash as of today.
If you say there is a generous 1 billion infectable computers and a *very generous* full out CPU utilisation of 1MH per computer you'll get a speed of around 1,000,000,000 MHash.  I.e. that would contribute a mere 0.25% of the global bitcoin hash power while the professional miners contribute the other 99.75% of the speed... i.e. even a global wide 100% effective virus would not even be noticeable and would return at most 9 bitcoins per day = $2,250 per day out of the ~$900,000 produced each day.

I'd still argue dangerous is an incorrect word for this as most people thin they could get hurt by even trying it... once someone knows the basics of it (i.e. never expose your private key, make sure you've backed up your private key) the funds should be very secure.  
Using a word such as 'complex' is more appropriate... much like a plane is very dangerous but realistically it's just complex and if you know what you're doing or just using it planes are incredibly safe.
So yes I can see how misuse or ignorance of it could be considered dangerous but seems disingenuous to label this as a common criticism of the protocol.

Misleading people with promoting like this is either corporate suicide by showing unethical behaviour from the outset or plain stupidity.

Quantum computing does not offer any speed increase for mining (at least not with known algorithms) because it's pure logic gate logic, not mathematical.
QCs can however impact ECDSA keys where the public key is known, this is why people say to never reuse a bitcoin address when you spend from it.  All modern wallets follow this practice but there are a lot of addresses out there where the public key has been used and there are funds held in the matching address which could become easy pickings for QCs capable of breaking ECDSA.
For the moment we can be confident the technology hasn't reached this point yet since someone would have stolen something by now if it were possible.

You're probably right in the long term but it needs a vast order of magnitude more users to average out demand to stabilise the exchange price and potentially become a global reserve currency in the long run.  Right now whales can influence the exchange price very easily  (heck I watched the market move by $1 this morning with a single trade of $1,200).
 
The only thing that can be said for sure is if the userbase continues to grow exponentially as it is, the USD/BTC exchange price will have to increase accordingly to curb this growing demand... 
I'm still very positive about bitcoin's future, if the Lightning Network layer on top of bitcoin works as well as advertised this will solve one of the major technical hurdles to enable mainstream adoption so really keen to see this happen before the next financial mess happens.

Let's be clear here... This is NOT a decentralised ledger they have made, in fact it has a centralised block generator (which I expect is closed source), no PoW or PoS and all tx's are vetted by Visa.  This tech is absolutely nothing new and could have been made 20 years ago but wasn't because it adds little to no value over regularly backed up SQL servers.  It is nothing more than a regular db made slow (it actually uses PostSQL under the hood).
The central authority verifies and signs transactions, the only thing that is open about it is anyone can read them and if you have been given permission and you could attempt to submit transactions to their database (if Visa made them public which I'd doubt anyhow ).  
I believe a project like this is called "designed by committee" because it makes absolutely no sense when you look at the bigger picture and they've totally missed the innovation of what bitcoin does.
(Just to add...)
The code itself is actually very well written, clearly a bunch of smart people working on it but they've been given a crazy mandate by the looks of it.  "Make a version of bitcoin we can use and make it very controlled".

My understanding is there are a number of reasons people opt for small blocks such as ensuring the system can remain decentralised, ensuring bandwidth doesn't cause problems with latency/transfer rates (especially when behind the GFW), ensuring CPU usage is reasonable, encourage layer 2 protocols now, among many others.  
All of these view have merit and understandable why a 2Mb block could be unappealing (I am actually in the 1Mb camp btw) however I would have thought one thing all of us would agree is sensible is to avoid a hardfork in future should the majority of miners wish to change it.
This proposal would make blocks at most 25% larger which is fairly insignificant change but what it does do is allow the system to adapt without a hardfork at a later date IF miners see it as sensible.
I think I'm pretty aware of all the arguments but I'd love to have some highlighted that I've overlooked that would make this default blocksize parameter suggestion void?
My hunch is, 90% of the miners will just use the bitcoin-core as long as it doesn't allow large blocks to be created out of the box.  This approach keeps the miners in control for keeping 1Mb blocks (well 1.25Mb blocks) for as long as the mining ecosystem needs to.

They did this to achieve a degree of decentralised consensus, i.e. the FED happens to work very much like a tiny bitcoin ecosystem where there are 12 miners who decide the rules such as supply rate changes and which transactions are allowed.

Unless you had it backed up, used cloud sync like dropbox/onedrive on that data directory (bad idea) those funds are probably lost.
If you had prey on the laptop you've got a reasonable chance of finding it, but guess you haven't otherwise you'd know this already.
If the thief was dumb enough to connect the device you may have some luck, or at least the authorities may be able to help.
If it was an apple you may be able to use their find my device app.
If it was a windows machine you could contact microsoft for the last IP address your machine was found on.  
If you had no password on it, you could try sending yourself an email offering a reward for returning the HD.
You may also find skype or other accounts will get their ip address.
As an absolute stretch goal you could try some more adventurous techniques like scan the exif info of any old webcam pics you took and if there is an id in there scan all uploaded photos to public social sharing sites to see if they match your computer. Not sure embedded webcams would add an exif unique id but if its imperative to get the laptop back its a more abstract idea.
Sadly by the time this approach works you'll find the machine has probably been long blanked and the chance of a it working very remote.

The problem with the Bolivia is that people know it is becoming worthless so given the choice people dump it for whatever they can thereby driving the value ever lower.
I heard that to stop the continual freefall they need to peg it to something that retains value far better than the currency (Gold, Oil, widely adopted Cryptos, etc...).
To do this is mainly a psychological problem since there is no way they can own enough of the asset to truely peg it to an asset.  I.e. it doesn't have to be definitively pegged merely have enough liquidity such that people believe it is pegged while they run a fractional reserve like every other functioning currency around the world.   
if they do attempt this approach I'd like to believe they will try Ethereum or dash rather than Bitcoin mainly because it's harder to clamp down on something like that.  Whilst bitcoin would clearly still survive it's incredibly bad press for it I'd rather we didn't go near.

I'm afraid I have no idea what the issue is as I've not used bitbargin myself but I'm sure people will be able to help if you give some details.
Can you share the expected bitcoin address destination addresses and/or transaction id/hash you are seeing?
Are you sure the money has left your wallet and isn't just stuck in limbo?  You can probably check this by resyncing your wallet.  If you have a txid you can check on various sites where the funds got transferred to and if they've been confirmed.
If bitbargin is using blockchain.info's API they may be having DNS issues given the disruption to that website yesterday?

Which wallet are you using?  Do you have a source/destination address we could look at?
Is it sent from an old Electrum or other old wallet?  If so you may find your transaction has been hit by the malleability attack.
The recent bitcoin core update addresses this but the main fix requires wallets to be updated to sign transactions correctly. 
I.e your transaction may well have gone through fine but your wallet hasn't noticed it's gone through.
If you are sending the funds to an exchange, have you checked the balance at the exchange?
It may well be you've set the fee too low but I'd be surprised if this was the issue unless you manually screwed around with it.
Yes, the usability of bitcoin wallets needs some love but remember these are separate things to the bitcoin network... if you're using a crappy wallet try upgrading it, speaking to the devs or swap wallets?

Buying forex on credit card incurs interest payments immediately.  Buying assets, which I expect bitcoin would be classed as, gives 30 days grace period before interest is charged.  I.e. you can make a small fortune by buying btc on credit card, waiting for the price to go up and sell at a profit returning the original amount borrowed.
If BTC price goes down you can sell it if it drops below say 2&amp; of the price, keep the cash to repay 30 days later.
I.e. maximum you stand to lose is 2&amp; but the upside is vastly higher than 2&amp; over 30 days so essentially a pretty safe bet with their money.  Not surprised they don't want people doing this with credit cards and just need to treat it like forex on cards and say interest is applied immediately.  To do that however the bank needs bitcoin accounted for like a forex by governments which may have tax implications if they don't do the right thing and class it as a new entity in it's own right.  E.g. digital currencies should be clearly defined in tax laws on how they can be used.

I'd sell most now as it's bound to crash soon.
Next I'd buy back in when the rise continues with relentless momentum to about $450 because I'd have already missed too much of the action and it's clearly going strong.
About 18 hours later I'd be selling everything I can as it crashes past $190, now feeling nauseous about how to tell the wife it's all gone.  'I was hacked'  yeah, she might just believe that line...
I'd finally buy back in with what remains at the stable price of $580 and be incredibly pissed off at owning a fraction of the bitcoin I started with.
This is why I stopped trading and just use it as stored value and shopping money.

Depending on where you live you may find Circle a good place to start.
If you want small amounts directly from others localbitcoins is a great place too.
If you want to be serious and buy larger amounts you probably need to look at exchanges like Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken, etc...
All will require ID verification for significant amounts, just like any bank asks, but after you're setup it's easy to buy/sell anytime you like.
What ever you do though, keep your bitcoins yourself... don't leave them with a service like Circle or an exchange.  With draw the bitcoins to a wallet where you know the password to spend them (i.e. the private keys).
If you're unsure which one to go for you can use this short link to download the appropriate software that lets you control the private key.  (
If you'd prefer to find the wallets yourself I'd suggest looking at MyCelium on mobiles and Electrum on PC/Mac as they're easiest to use and support an easy back up system where you just write down 12 words and you can now spend your bitcoin anywhere in the world on any computer.

Lobbiests brainwashing the MPs.  MPs are just smart people wanting to do good like most, they'll be buying this 'protects people' line probably because they don't really understand bitcoin (and probably don't have the time to learn about it in detail).  If someone tells them banning it will be good for society they'll probably do as they're advised.  If they're a bit smarter and independent they'd do a bit more research to see why the private financial institutions are really trying to outlaw it.
If we're lucky they'll at least see that digital currencies had nothing to do with terrorist activity and draw their own conclusions on why outlawing all competitors and innovation to the private banking system is probably a bad idea for society.

The main parts hold bitcoin back IMHO are
1) Simplicity in exchanging bitcoin for local currency.  When the first Bureau de Change's start supporting BTC currency it will be incredibly helpful to people for solving this for example.
2) Scalability.  Microtransactions used to be easy, now they are possible but tricky via payment channels of bitcoinj.  We need a standardised layer on top of bitcoin to address this.  LN or sidechain, either/both will do but we need simple command line SPV style wallets to trade using this technology so easy tools can be built on top of it for end users.  These systems can only go mainstream when easily available on iOS/Android devices. 
3) Have wallets support the payment protocol layer so we can issue refunds, keep details of transactions we made. Not sure how these align with microtransactions but needs to be compatible and seamless.
4) Have an identity -&gt; xpub key system to allow payments to email addresses and the likes.
5) Ability for Apple/Google/MC/Visa/PayPal/Swift/SEPA or other major payment provider to utilise btc directly as deposit and withdrawal or a bitcoin company to usurp them by offering a better service... i.e. to enable the currency for purchasing transactions.  Whilst people can use bitcoin natively most don't want to write and maintain wallet software hence why these services will have a demand.
6) As Gavin keeps mentioning, Bitcoind may do well separating into it's components (network/protocol app, mining app, wallet app) to make it plugin related.  This would open the doors to easy implementation of payment channels, LN, HD wallet support, merchant wallets, etc...
None are easy yet I'd expect most if not all are likely to get done... just takes time.

333MH/s is going to earn you close to nothing in your lifetime.  A reasonable home miner needs to be in the region of 1TH  (i.e. 3000 times faster than that 333MH one)
Yes you can mine other SHA256 based currencies, there are a few out there.
Many however don't use SHA for their hashing but instead using SCRYPT or another and you won't be able to mine those.
If you're getting into mining just for fun to see how it works grab yourself a 30GH+ miner, you'll make around $0.05 per day (probably a loss on the electricity used) but at least you'll have done it and know the steps to set it up.  If you want to make significant money with it you'll need a vastly more powerful setup I'm afraid... think dedicated data center stuff to compete nowadays.

I still don't see how a user sets the consensus rules they want to follow without participating in mining? 
Surely to have any influence on what goes into the blockchain the user needs to sometimes be able to propose a block in the blockchain and the only way I know of doing that is when a 'user' mines... 
I.e. miners are the only ones who control what the blockchain looks like, the users control bitcoin only as much as a taxi drivers control how Toyota Prius cars are made but perhaps I'm missing the point?
Also, unless I'm mistaken (which may very well be the case so this isn't confrontational, merely I'd like to know what is correct), I'm not aware of segwit changing the fixed blockchain blocksize limit at all?  If it has changed, what size have they set and/or what adaptive algorithm is being used?

"Trust Lightning Network brought to you by R3" ? I'm not sure what R3 has to do with LN?  Is this just an example of a group offering a LN implementation because there is still no centralisation there given anyone can implement this (as many are).
Also I believe older nodes will still process Segwit transactions just fine, simply old nodes can't verify their proofs without upgrading to the latest code base that can handle segwit proofs.  If you don't like them, don't use them, it shouldn't prevent you from upgrading and supporting progress.
I agree with your sidechain sentiment but the malleability issue that makes sidechains tricky (and generally using bitcoin) is solved with Segwit.  If I'm not being clear enough, as a developer using bitcoin I have sleepless nights thinking about malleability attacks because there are so many ways to achieve the annoying attack.  It also solves the issue of how to **safely** add new instructions later without a hard fork, this is imperative to have for bitcoin's long term success.
Please try to keep an open mind, bitcoin is an experiment as Satoshi said, this involves learning from what works and what doesn't and taking steps to refine it otherwise another digital currency with these capabilities would become the leading chain.
Everyone is reluctant to change, but people using bitcoin are already more open minded than most in seeing how some virtual money not backed by anything could be considered real value globally.
Don't get me wrong, I fully agree with you that segwit is a significant technical change that probably has some minor risks but bitcoin absolutely needs this sort of enhancement to continue to succeed.  Holding our breath and doing absolutely nothing is a far worse risk than not evolving.  Absolute worst case scenario, segwit merely gets disabled by miners in a future version and we're back to where we are now.  I expect however segwit is going to be a huge success when adopted.

No, they derive all the keys from a standard way so you can simply enter your backup seed on another compatible program to access your funds there.

2008, Satoshi Nakamoto.  It is likely inspired by other previous currencies but I believe the blockchain was new to Bitcoin.

I think people are taking it seriously and for good reason.  This isn't just some small competitive company that can be ignored, this is about a new technology that has been invented that changes the idea of private institutions managing a database to describe stored value.
People trying to pigeon hole this into existing paradigms are missing the point of what an invention is.
Who knows if the bitcoin experiment will continue it's steady growth but if it doesn't something else certainly will as it's just fundamentally better way of working than trusting a private company not to mess with the books.
I'm not saying Bitcoin is the only thing they should be paying attention too either.  Google Pay, Apple Pay, whilst absolutely miniscule compared to Bitcoin, should be on their radar too.  If they prove successful why would Apple or Google want to use a bank for instance, those entities are large enough to become their own.
The fact is banking is about to get the biggest shake up it's ever had much like the printing industry did about 15 years ago and the directors need to be following these new technologies avidly to remain competitive as the technology is only going to get better.

Perfectly valid question and yes post away here and welcome! ;)
The good wallets you want to use utilise the 'HD Wallet' standard whereby you control your private keys locally.  The HD stands for hierarchical deterministic and is merely a fancy way of saying, if you have the root number (normally expressed as 12 dictionary words), you can derive all your future bitcoin addresses from this which makes backing up a doddle.
Sadly I'm not aware of any wallet by a single provider that works on both Mac and Android tablet that will allow this but perhaps others can chime in...
My current understanding would be to use MyCelium on your tablet and Electrum on your Mac.
I would expect that both of these can accept your HD seed so that you can access your funds on both devices.
I have to admit I've not tried this but I would have thought this should work as long as Electrum uses the same HD derivation algorithm.

Perhaps but we also have to keep in mind that cash is a sovereign thing where supply is constantly growing exponentially.  It's the reason every 10 years  it is worth half as much as it used to be. 
 Bitcoin's halving is soon to happen so will finally have a similar inflation rate for the next 4 years but after that it will out perform any fiat as a store of value.
This is no different than people buying property to protect the their earned value from inflation.  What is different however is anyone in the world can do it and almost instantly.

* There is a viable decentralised open source competitor appear with a new USP.
* Lack of innovation leading to stagnation and VC funds dry up
* The system has an unexpected vulnerability
* Whales playing
*Temporary Increased exchange price*
* Capital controls in a place that is able to purchase btc easily
* Innovation happens on top of bitcoin that increases each of the coin's value.
* Specular investors attracted
* Endorsement by influential entities.
* Whales playing
*Exchange price goes utterly mental*
* People become aware it can be used as a global reserve currency.
* Forex brokers start trading bitcoin
* A killer app appears that usurps the banking system.  
* A government adopts it over a fiat. (v unlikely)
* Exchanges get mainstream adoption used for investment funds and pensions.
* Lightning network or equivalent scaling system is open and easy to use/include in existing payment models.

Do you think there might be any chance you will ask the central bank to hold a few bitcoin in its reserves?

ELI5?  
Imagine there is a computer that stores the entire bitcoin database.  Bitcoin is stored in 'addresses' which can be thought of like an email address.  This database is simply a list of addresses and the balance of bitcoin held at each address, hence why you can have 0.0001bitcoin stored at address 1fa8923n23909023492392.  This bitcoin database is incredibly robust and copied in its entirety across thousands of machines that make up the bitcoin network.  You can send your transaction requests to any of these machines and if valid, your transaction is included in the database and replicated across all the machines in the network automatically.
To move coins from your address to someone elses you simply need the password associated with the address you want to send from... i.e. the private key.
The private key is nothing special, it's just a very very big number... you can pick one in your mind and write it down on paper if you really wanted to (I think it's like 70 digits long in base 10), literally any number.  The clever thing is this private key number can have some maths applied to it and you get another number (well 2 numbers, but we're ELI5 here).  
This new number is called the public key, you'll never normally see this but this public key number is used to create the address.
  The bitcoin database never knows your private key, you must keep that secret and away from prying eyes.
When you want to send funds from your address to another one, your wallet software will write some instructions like "Send 0.1btc from &lt;myaddress&gt; to &lt;anotheraddress&gt;" .  The clever bit is this message is 'signed' using your private key, what this means in practice is it adds another unique number to the transaction that can only be worked out if you know the private key number.  This way the network will only accept valid transactions and you can't spoof owning someone elses address.
The database analogy goes so far but in truth there's a little more to it as the db is actually closer to a database of receipts with challenges on each to allow you to forward the funds to someone else.  It's a subtle difference but allows you to do things like prevent funds from being spent until a future time or allow clever things like requiring more than one password/private key to spend the funds.

Banks are good in many ways.  They allow fractional reserve banking to exist which is good for redistributing the wealth of those who don't know what this is.
They're also good because they create jobs for people, they offer simple services and offer a degree of protection for small sums of money.
They are bad in that there is no alternative to using them, private institutions heavily influence countries, they effectively self-regulate since their wages depend on maximising profits within the ecosystem, a few bad apples within banks can do unethical things such as rigging rates, investing in companies that facilitate things you may not like (e.g. investing in arms companies, lobbying, regulations).
Basically if an individual setup and ran bank they would go to jail for the process it uses because it is effectively a ponzi scheme that will keep going strong until critical point is reached and full on collapse is inevitable because they'll have no money left.
Cryptos merely bring competition to an open market rather than a closed system with no alternatives so will help keep things in check and innovation to continue forward.

Bitcoin only has such volatility because the user base is small and a lot of speculation vs utility is happening.  
As more people use it the system gains 'mass' so a given change X is diluted by the amount the system is valued at.
Last week a few people dumped $100m worth of bitcoin quickly and moved the price by just 2.5%.
If that was done say 2 years ago it would have caused probably 20-30% value change!
To get more people actually using it rather than speculating we need Layer 2 systems like LN to make it usable for the masses (i.e. avoid high fees, confirmation times, instantly global, decentralised, not requiring trusting a bank).

I love that segwit has been implemented and about to be rolled out but it is just an optimisation, far from a long term fix for blocksizes.  Yes I think it helps in many ways and v excited about it too but the space saving it gives is more a side benefit IMHO.
There is still the hurdle to get wallets to want to use it which will take time and will inevitably encounter full blocks again.
I'm not speaking for others with the 1Mb limit but currently there is a hardcoded value that does limit blocks in the blockchain to 1Mb... that hardcoded value is what I'm questioning.  I.e. perhaps we should just remove it and put in place a more future proof test and just change default values so the system remains uneffected until miners want to support larger blocks and can safely increase it.

It's a bit like someone demanding payment in Euros and you only own USD... if you want to pay it you'll have to exchange USD to euros (or your bank will and take a lovely slice of profit).
This doesn't make euros good or bad, it is merely a form of value.  It's also totally irrelevant if a company accepts euros or not, the fact is we can't print ourselves euros just like we can't print bitcoin... the company would have to trade their local currency with someone for bitcoin just like any foreign exchange.
Remember bitcoin is agnostic to it's use just like any other money.

Someone plants a bit of misinformation on some bogus website tying Paris and a cryptocurrency... a bigger media outlet picks it up and reprints it, later checks their facts and finds out it's totally made up so prints a retractment however other journalists, who should know better and get paid more, simply copy/paste a false story and pass it off as their own.

You can see precisely how many coins there are since you can manually count them on your own PC by running a bitcoin node if you really want to.
Alternatively you can use a service that monitors the blockchain themselves too...
As for exchanges operating fractional banking, yes it's almost a certainty since centralised exchanges can print whatever number they like to their users.  As long as there isn't a withdrawal run on their services no one can ever tell except the auditors.  If anyone wants to do this with cash you need a license to misreport your holdings of your clients... private banks are allowed to do it but it's incredibly difficult to obtain a banking license for this reason.
Just keep in mind that if you (and only you) have the private key to the addresses storing the bitcoins you can be certain you own them and aren't fractionally held or susceptible to QE.

Is it a keyboard driver, modifies Windows kernel, do some other funky thing I didn't know was possible?  If an application gets the correct keystrokes I'm just not sure how it prevents a key logger to do it/

You buy bitcoin at exchanges or p2p services like localbitcoin for $100 worth.  These are just like bank accounts and all reputable ones adhere to KnowYourCustomer /AntiMoneyLaundering laws like any foreign exchange shop does... 
Make sure you transfer your bitcoin out of the exchange once you've bought it and send the funds to your own wallet.  For long term storage an offline wallet from bitaddress.org is worth considering, otherwise try Electrum, MyCelium or Bread wallet depending on the device/OS you're using is a great wallet for regular spending and you control the funds.
You only truly own the bitcoin if you have the private key to the address they're stored in... I.e. you don't really own the bitcoin in an exchange!
Bitcoin is nothing to do with tax evasion, let's just be clear on that.  If someone asks to be paid in cash and doesn't declare it, that's tax evasion... the cash itself is merely a store of value...  same goes for bitcoin.
If you are earning value doing jobs you must still pay any taxes due on that earned value in your local currency.  This is true if you earn bitcoin, wheat, gold, video games, etc...  It varies from country to country so best to ask someone local who knows your laws answers this but most of the world does not have to pay tax on buying bitcoin since it's just an asset like any other.  
Selling bitcoin when you've made a profit in terms of local currency can be liable for tax... usually it has to be a significant profit and $100 isn't going to get anywhere near that threshold in most countries... again I don't know about Malaysia so best to ask an accountant or the tax office if it's unclear.
Generally, as long as bitcoin is legal in Malaysia, (checking on Wikipedia it appears to be fine) I think just buying it and holding it seems pretty easy.
Welcome to the world of bitcoin :)

I'd like to hear any QC experts on this too as my understanding is that to break ECDSA and derive a private key from a public key with a quantum computer would require many rounds and would therefore still be quite time consuming.  Certainly far faster than conventional machines but talking vastly longer than 10 minutes per key, i.e. this would give a window of opportunity to safely move funds from ecdsa to a quantum resistant version.  It would be great to hear if someone has any insight on how fast this process could be done.

Just because bitcoin can operate as P2P doesn't mean everyone must run a full node.
You can still interact with the P2P network of nodes without running the node yourself.
Once a lite version of bitcoind with a wallet exists (next version I believe) recommending bitcoind for technical newbies is more viable... right now anyone just getting started with btc wants to understand transactions and a wallet before wrestling with downloading a 40Gb blockchain.

24,000 sale is the same number of coins as 3 days of mining... I'll be surprised if it even registers on the price unless they do something daft like chuck them on a low volume exchange all at once.
If I was the controller I'd be highlighting the gov would do well holding onto a few rather than giving them away to private companies and individuals for local fiat... Or rephrased, why would we trade away a tangible global asset for money they can simply print more of anyhow?

It's known 1 bitcoin is one 21millionith of the commodity. It's an amazing store of value if bitcoin were a common global commodity everyone recognised or things were priced in Bitcoin but yes we're not even close yet.
Right now it's so early the valuation is mainly speculation derived by technology enthusiasts who see it's utility value or potential valuation by others... The greater fool theory that most art, precious metals and stocks are based on.
This makes the valuation very volatile while the user base is growing, so a terrifying store of value right now... in many years to come if the experiment continues to grow well it certainly looks a far better store of value than any fiat.

The most common reason I can think of is someone is launching a new alt coin and they want to get a fair distribution of coins in this new alt coin.  One way to do this is to ask them to send coins to a 'proof of burn' address showing they have destroyed some bitcoin meaning no individual benefited but the person sending the coins takes a provable financial hit (inadvertently increasing the value of bitcoin for every bitcoin owner because there are less now available).
The owner of the new coin probably wouldn't want to accept the bitcoin since they'd be called a scammer if the alt coin dies (as they usually do) yet the alt coin owner now would have real bitcoin to spend.
Honestly it's more a thing that can be done so people will find interesting ideas of utilising it.
In time I wouldn't be surprised to see Robin Hood hackers targeting a nefarious organisation like a terrorist group, bank running a scam, environmental damaging companies, etc.. with a locker type virus whereby a demand for coins to be sent to a burn address is requested for restoring their IT resources.  This could be incredibly expensive for the target whilst at the same time not benefiting any specific individual (i.e. there are no coins to ever follow) and the rest of the world who are within the global bitcoin ecosystem will benefit as the supply is now reducing at the same time as demand rising.

If the network forked you still have 10 in both chains. 
If you try to spend say 1 of those bitcoin's, you'll find it spends them in both chains UNLESS you specifically craft a transaction to depend on a transaction that caused (or causes) a fork.  I.e. for 99.999% of bitcoin users your coins will be spent identically in both forks.
Eventually the weaker of the two chains will disappear and typically this will happen in under a few hours.

So you probably already know this but you're not storing the coins on your phone, the coins themselves are stored on the decentralized bitcoin blockchain... this means all you need is the private keys enabling you to spend the funds at those addresses you're seeing.
Coinbase I believe controls this for you so you need not worry about these except for the usual login/password (and potential 2 factor authentication system if you're using this).
BreadWallet just needs you to write down the seed (those 12 words it offers you).  That seed generates all the private keys for your wallet regardless to how many new addresses/transactions you make.
Blockchain requires your password and private keys, I'm not sure how these are backed up on iPhone I'm afraid but if it's like the website they'll have asked you to write down your backup phrase to retrieve the coins.  
Remember Blockchain and Bread do not have access to your private keys at all so if you lose the phone you'll need that backup to retrieve them.
Backing up your phone in iTunes will probably work but again it may not... I've not tried this but I'd have thought it was a security hole if it did backup your private keys via iTunes!

Not a stupid question at all!
The issue is that another miner could produce a valid 10Gb block(s) and even those miners who set a 1Mb block themselves would have to accept the 10Gb block if it's part of the valid chain.
It is a bit of a storm in a tea cup thing as we just need the system to allow ramping up automatically as network speeds inevitably increase in the coming years.
Seems like we're just going to wait until it is a problem and then all miners will quickly jump to the most popular decision at the time.

I certainly wouldn't accept direct payment if it's currently banned in your country.

Really sorry to hear about your loss.
I have to admit this would be easier as an inside job... does your router keep any logs that may help?
Also how could they get onto a mac and modify anything in the keychain or sensitive files without a local password?  
Seems rather fishy, especially with no VNC logs.
Finally I'm gobsmacked someone could transfer that amount of btc from blockchain.info without being prompted for some additional authorisation but I guess if 2FA wasn't enabled it is probably possible.
Sadly I would double check your staff's logs (who could have had access to the machine without VNC, e.g. cleaners?) just to be sure it's not another inside job problem because VNC seems unlikely without any logs being left.
For future reference, move your coins from blockchain.info, use copay's multisignature wallet at the very minimum so you are reassured that the funds are safer
Good luck with the search.

Agreed, to make a system tamper proof the really easy way is Visa could just give clients a filtered csv file on demand and digitally sign it themselves to say it's correct.
That might be too simplistic and does lack protection of reordering issues and/or creative tinkering from an employee.
With a single trusted entity it's simply add one or two columns in a database.
txsigned and optionally txhash for optimisation.
txhash takes the hash of the current row and the previous row.  It can be calculated hence doesn't really need to be stored in the db but useful if you want to share the db and blank the fields not relevant to another client.
txsigned is that hash value signed with something like ECDSA or RSA if you're talking 10 years ago.  
Now it's impossible for anyone except the keeper of the private key to add any data to the ~~blockchain~~ database and anyone else can verify it's integrity easily.
That's all, I'd happily take a pay check of millions to solve their db woes in a few weeks ;)
Not sure what the heck the payment systems and banks are playing at with this mickey mouse implementation they've done.  
They should simply ditch it and start using bitcoin payment channels for settlement optimisation before their competitors figure this out.

Investing in mining is a zero sum game, if you're asking this question it indicates you may need to do more research on how it works and why it's not a money press.  In a nutshell, you only make significant money mining while you are the one producing the most cost efficient hashes with the most startup cost.
I.e. you need to have access to cheap electricity (in terms of global electricity costs), own the most efficient ASIC the rest of the world doesn't have access too, and produce a significant number of hashes to make it all worthwhile (Several thousand terrahashes)
If you're looking to speculatively invest in bitcoin you are far far safer simply buying bitcoin from an exchange.
If you're wanting to make huge sums of money simply make something in the bitcoin market to become the world leader before the big boys arrive and start buying up the small companies.

Sort of, yes.  The private key is merely to enable you to control the bitcoins at the address generated by that specific private key.  I.e. the bitcoins are not on your computer in the first place.
It's a subtle but important distinction to remember!
It's far easier to use a HD compatible wallet and store just the master key seed which generates all the private keys for you,  you're playing with fire backing up specific private keys.  The HD seed means you don't need to worry about this and merely remembering those 12 words (even in your head) means your bitcoin are always available. 
Take a peek at Electrum, MyCelium, Bread, wallets...
Also it's safer to send bitcoin to a new address than sharing specific private keys between machines, the main reason is when you spend from an address most wallets send the change to a totally new address/private key so you need to remember to keep these in sync too as without an HD wallet the change addresses are most likely different.  Again with HD wallets it's not an issue hence why they're highly recommended for general spending.

To be fair, Bitcoin has around 8% fee via inflation at the moment.  Next year it'll be around 4-5% due to the block reward halving.
People are already losing at least 2%-5% via inflation but generally ignored so added to the 0.75% fee it's still makes bitcoin a speculative asset until another 4 years time when yet another halving happens... at that point it'll be a reasonable debate as to which is a better store of value. Also it may take around this length of time for the next layer of protocols built on top of bitcoin to facilitate mainstream market usage.
I.e. the experiment is still doing incredibly well but I wouldn't expect a price surge anytime soon unless a crisis happens or some killer app that only accepts bitcoin appears.

I wouldn't claim bitcoin is the silver bullet to address all financial woes I'm afraid but I do believe it does what cash and gold do but better as it's digital and you know the maximum supply available.
Firstly if cash or gold is stolen it's the same procedure should bitcoin be stolen and probably the same outcome of it'll never be recovered.  Secondly no one has ever lost any bitcoin due to bitcoin network being hacked that I'm aware of.  People have lost bitcoin by trusting a service to look after their bitcoin though (aka the famous MtGox and other exchanges that have been hacked).  This is no different than someone on the highstreet asking to hold onto your cash for you and give it back... madness without regulation and hence exchanges need a trusted authority they can optionally sign up to showing they are audited and trustworthy.  This should not be enforced by law but instead a government body people can subscribe to if they choose to sign up to showing they're genuine.
I can't see bitcoin ever replacing the banks... more it complements a tangible store of value much like gold or property does but outside of the influence of the fractional banking system (think Icesave, Lehman Brothers as to how surprisingly dangerous fractional banks inevitably pushed to their limits without tangible reserves).  It also removes the need for legacy and grossly inadaquate systems like SWIFT/CHAPS/WesternUnion.  Taking 24 hours for a transfer?  That's madness in a society when we can order a film instantly streamed from another country, why should we accept the money transfer should take any longer?
Scams exist before bitcoin and they'll exist after, the issue is internet money opens the doors to new scams we're all learning how to thwart, it'll take time but seems inevitable if you can transfer value of the internet instantly without paying someone else to handle it there is a massive niche it fills.

People who are in a position to buy thousands of bitcoin have an incentive to artificially lower the price on exchanges by selling many of the bitcoin they own.  Now they can bid for those coins at a slightly lower price knowing that when they buy back their sold bitcoin they'll push the price back up and instantly profit from the out of market purchase.
No proof this is happening, just if I had thousands of coins looking to buy more I'd be considering this right now...

Just grab a wallet like electrum on PC/Mac, Bread on iOS and MyCelium on Android ( does this automatically for you).
From there you just post up a receiving address on your website somewhere and you're done.

Alternatively blockchain.info is a really easy getting started place and can give you the address as well.

Unless you trust the provider you need a network connection.
For remote places SMS wallets would work although you'll probably need to trust the wallet provider with your private key to that spending money.
It is technically possible to have the private keys local on your phone, sign a transaction and transmit this message as an SMS to a node with blockchain connectivity... there just isn't the demand for this service yet but is trivial to write should it become helpful.
If there is a slim degree of trust or intermittent you can take a signed transaction from someone that either of you can publish later to commit the transfer on the blockchain... the trust comes from the fact that you need to believe they have sufficient bitcoins to make that offline transaction.  
Without the blockchain you can only verify they had funds up until the last time you synced and you'll have to trust they don't try to double spent the funds they are paying you with.
I fully expect travellers may use bitcoin a bit like far more convenient travellers cheques that are secure... I.e. you can use them to convert bits to the local currency as and when you need it and in an area that has connectivity.  For shop transactions I'd fully expect to use the local currency but happy to be proved wrong on this!

I know that was meant to be provocative but equally you have a point, this is the mindset of most institutions that don't understand bitcoin and will likely learn the hard way as it's what we were brought up with.
Ie They'll operate a virtual currency and eventually get hacked externally or internally and realise they're now somehow operating a fractional reserve without a clue as to which were valid and which were fraudulent transactions. What's worse, if it's real value associated they risk litigation / bankruptcy when it is compromised so will hide the fact for as long as possible like all ponzi schemes do.
Using a system outside of a centralised entity removes this design flaw.  If FB haven't planned for utilising digital currencies I expect they will after the next big data compromise fiasco...

Alternatives are -

How long is your password? Would you have likely used obscure passwords back then? Perhaps it's the  Characters at the start or end of a your expected pw?
I'd try the script approach too but sounds like you've done that... Would double check your script works on a pw you know.

Absolutely spot on!  Their analysts are totally misunderstanding it if they believe it's a competitor, this is a massive opportunity for them unless of course Visa/Amex does it first.  Bitcoin's biggest barriers to mass adoption is merely usability and credibility to the general public.  Both issues are constantly diminishing as the technology matures and becomes more established but MC has a chance to become the world leader if they simply embrace it as another currency leaving Visa/Amex in a rather weak position.
It would also help them avoid any internal/clearing house fees for international payments since they can now have free access to a global remittance system.

They will be locked and unusable by anyone unless you leave details on how people can access them.
Putting them in a will or details in a safe with mention of this in your will is the easiest way.
Failing that you can do something more technical and generate a transaction that isn't spendable for say 50 years of any of your cold wallet storage.  For hot wallets this transaction would need updating each time you spend from it so probably only feasible if your wallet provider offers this feature (I'm not aware of any that do yet)
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:07:12
Think of it as you can write your own web browser too... but if you don't follow the rules your traffic will simply be rejected by the other servers out there.
The main reference client is controlled by a few, most people (i.e. miners) use this reference client to avoid ambiguity on what makes a valid transaction others will also agree is valid.  
Any feature that has &gt; 50% of the mining network capable of supporting it becomes the rule to follow.  It's beautifully self re-enforcing.
We do however need sidechains urgently as people are rightfully nervous about making big changes to bitcoin's network now so much money is involved... which a mistake can always be reversed at worse it causes perception issues. Side chains will allow people to play with new features easily while having the backing of bitcoin.

I'd like to show him why it's a provable finite resource so vastly better than any precious metal or fiat in regards to storing value.   It can't be faked, it can't be copied, it can't be stopped... Why the code can be trusted, SHA, elliptic curves, etc were not invented for Bitcoin but are standard parts of computer security... P2P is very disruptive proven robust technology also not invented by Bitcoin... there are no hacking backdoors or magic going on here, this is computer science 101 and Bitcoin is merely a very clever person(s) bringing together these proven technologies in an ideological way to create the first finite global digital resource that can be traded instantly around the world.  This next step was inevitable and Bitcoin appears to be the implementation that's doing it.

Rooting it may be safe as long as you're not allowing other apps on your phone root access... typically though people root their phone do precisely this.  The software you use to root however may have malware in as well which would also have full access.  
Custom ROMs also could clearly do the same too... issue is you just don't know what is in that stuff unless you wrote it.
Issue is once you break that 'chain of trust' from the manufacturer-&gt;operator-&gt;playstore-&gt;app installing process you have very little recourse on knowing if the app is going to play nicely.
Being realistic about it, it's probably pretty safe at the moment as Bitcoin isn't mainstream but in the years to come this will be a very real issue so needs attention now.
For instance, if someone were to writing something nasty it would probably steal the funds a week/month/year later so the culprit app isn't easy to identify.  Tricks like searching for the file like wallet.dat as a salted hash so a virus scanner couldn't even realize what it was doing would work well.  
Guess what I'm saying is, it's fine to use and don't worry too much but if you're storing more than you'd put in a physical wallet you're asking for regret should your phone ever become compromised.
I may add, this isn't bitcoin's issue... at this point your email/passwords to popular sites and banking details would also be compromised... we don't hear of this much hence why I think it's being overly paranoid worrying about this yet but because it can happen it will happen unless the phone manufacturers step up their game on security and realize root access is wanted by many users.

I wasn't aware of them producing weak private keys, do you have a reference for this as I think this could be misinformation here.
They did use a poor random number generator in the android app which meant the R value when signing transactions was being reused hence someone can derive the private key with that knowledge... this is true for any wallet online or offline though and now they fixed it they'll know to look out for it in future.
They solved it on android so would like to think it's unlikely they'll fall foul of this again.
You have points about the other aspects but I think these are merely risks to be considered over the convenience in using it.  
I'd certainly rate bc.i over keeping funds in an exchange.

Seems a rather well informed report and somewhat positive even if it does dwell on a digital currency risks.
Two items I'd call out about it though, firstly I prefer when people refer to bitcoin and other decentralized systems as digital currencies rather than virtual currencies given it is a stark difference between the two.  I.e. there is a massive difference between Linden dollars, Starbucks points and Airmiles when compared to a decentralized system.  
Virtual currencies have been around since the first internet games and their centralized nature means they are of no credible use in business value transfer.  Digital currencies are however and they are not confined to the virtual community like the original virtual currency definition stated.  A Casascius coin is an extreme example how bitcoin still holds value outside of the bitcoin network.
Secondly, I'd disagree with this statement "*Indeed, M3 might be a better reference, given that M1 as a definition of a country’s money supply focuses on the role of money as a means of exchange, whereas virtual currencies are hardly used for payments at all.*"
Bitcoin is clearly an M0/MB valuation as it is the base/finite resource where all units can be accounted for *without any fractional banking*.  Interestingly the ECB doesn't appear to publish this M0/monetary base value for the euro.
To obtain a Bitcoin M1 valuation would be meaningless since bitcoin banks (places that hold a persons private keys and therefore that client's funds) have no obligation on any reserve rate.  Going back to my original point, a bitcoin bank that practised fractional banking would move from using a tangible digital currency to a virtual one for use at only that particular bank.  Here they can quote whatever valuation they like since they control their own worthless currency now as long as all their clients don't ask for their money back.

I fear you're correct that a bubble is incoming since there will be a lot of new people introduced to digital currencies with the recent ATH.  If history is anything to go by there will be a lot of new people trying to get rich quick who will sell just as quickly when they realise the value can go down too but I don't believe it is in a bubble just yet.

Guess it depends on how much you trust the device it's running on, mycelium is pretty solid from everything I've heard about it.
Paper wallets should be the most secure way but even these are not 100%  (vastly better than anything a bank can currently offer though!)
The app is most secure on an un-jailbroken iOS device as the OS is pretty darn good at keeping bad code from reading or touching areas it shouldn't.
On Android it should be of similar quality if you haven't rooted it... if you've rooted or jailbroken your phone all bets are off so would recommend putting some of your btc (at least what you want to keep as savings) as a paper wallet to be prudent.
The issue you have with devices is it's actually possible to remotely view and control devices if you infect them.  For 4.3 btc the effort/reward ratio to do this sort of targeted attack is very unlikely so probably safe... most you'll fall foul of would be some generic malware targeting specific bitcoin app(s).  I'm not aware of any in the wild on Android or iOS so would say you're pretty safe unless you're doing really stupid things like downloading free hacked games.
On PC the worst malware I've heard of is ones that find wallet.dat files, use insecured TeamViewer credentials or change bitcoin addresses held in the copy/paste memory to the attackers.
Would be good to hear if anyone has a list of iOS/Android malware discovered and/or lost any coins on their phone as I'm not aware of anyone yet.

Whilst I agree with his sentiment that 'blockchain' is hype, I do see bitcoin as being used more and more... just look at what happened the last 5 days. 
Not saying this is a particularly positive use-case but the point is people are using it and adoption is continuing to accelerate because it's still the best value transfer mechanism on the internet.

Hal was clearly an incredibly talented and smart guy, wish I'd have had the honour to have met him.
He clearly knew cryptography very well so would have been certain to have written down his private keys for his family.  The fact his illness was far from sudden and his mind still just as active, it's hard to imagine a scenario where he wouldn't have left the funds to his family in a will.  Perhaps a solicitor has the numbers to issue to the family at a later date or more simply he wasn't satoshi, just one of the many incredibly smart people involved in the experiment.
Personally I'd like to leave it at he's Satoshi to stop an endless hunt.  I wouldn't be too surprised to find it's a consortium think tank that made it and needs to remain anonymous.

Hmm... wish I understood how to do this and sorry if this is creepy but sounded interesting to try.
Look like you've been Mining since early 2014.
Found the address 13MZs2DHKqyQnySJkGCRwcSRqYm4fDeRfy in an image in one of your blog posts.  (First assumption which could be wrong!)
Tracing it back gets to here for around 410BTC received.  
or about $221k funds in today's money.   I'd have thought this address was a mining pool address at first but it uses multisig in it which makes me think it's probably an individual handling it.
I'm pretty sure this is a very bad piss poor attempt and massively wrong but seemed a fun game and would love others to show how it can be done better... would be a good learning lesson for us all in knowing how visible bitcoin is to general public without court orders to the exchanges/mining pools/VPN services.

Seed, allows many private keys/addresses to be derived from that one value and when you go to spend any funds at an address the new change address is automatically still covered by the same seed.

In time this may become the norm but right now the technology is too hard for non-technical people to want to use.  People fear change and putting your savings in something you don't understand is a stupid idea.  As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and people understand it's a finite digital resource this migration is inevitable (it may be another digital currency but right now bitcoin is vastly ahead of anything else).
Right now I'd expect even the most clued up people only put a percentage of their savings into bitcoin as whilst exciting keep in mind it's only 6 years old and talking about profound impacts on stock markets, forex, global trade and banks... this change isn't going to happen quickly.

Hi aquafina11... I'm assuming that's not your real name?  This is sort of the whole point of bitcoin.  You don't need to be assigned a name, you just create one yourself like you've done on reddit.
Simply pick a very big number (X), calculate the matching public key number (Y) and you now have an address you can ask people to send funds to.  You don't even need to use the internet for this bit!
Now when you want to spend your funds at (Y), you use that number (X) to unlock them and transfer the value to other addresses(Y2, Y3, ... ).  That other addresses (Y2, Y3, ...) could be owned by you, could be another person, a group of people or even a computer.  I.e. it's whoever knows the matching (X2, X3... ) numbers to spend the funds.
Therefore whilst you can see funds moving from one address to another, you have no idea who owns them.
If you trade with someone you know their address and from that you can ask them where they got their funds, and so on and so on... essentially it prevents blanket surveillance of 'guilty until innocent' to the 'innocent until guilty' which most people aspire for.
I.e. if someone did something very bad with bitcoin, people can generally put the time in to find who made the transaction when the funds move and it becomes irrefutable proof.  But given it's so time consuming people would only do it when necessary.
That's the theory, however people have been able to derive who owns what in areas where they know their spending habits and connections to various accounts... this means some people can accept or deny funds from certain addresses.  This is why tumblers have appeared on the scene and in order to maintain fungibility, a key aspect of a tradeable resource, it's inevitable we will see more and more untraceable transactions solutions appearing since when they appear they will be a stronger store of value.
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:17:30
"If ECDSA is cracked, bitcoin is toast... period!"
I don't think this is true, ECDSA only effects people who reuse addresses where their public key is made available to others.
Equally if ecdsa is proven to be compromised it is perfectly feasible to change bitcoin to support a new encryption method on top of ECDSA to migrate funds to.
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:41:31
One could argue it is almost inevitable. You can transfer BTC from country to country faster than exchanging a fiat currency thereby arbitrage of every currency becomes possible assuming you can buy/sell BTC instantly in the 2 countries.  This makes BTC a common global reserve currency.
In practice it's difficult to do yet as these exchanges have a delay in fiat funds being deposited, especially for large sums but it's getting more efficient in many countries every day.   Once a global bank gets involved it's likely to have a profound change to the financial world.
24 hours to transfer funds will sound laughable in a few years.

I have to disagree, if someone has no cash they merely have an IOU from a private bank (not a central bank)... we've seen how that played out in 2008, in Greece and in Iceland.  
At least with cash the worst that happens is the central bank prints more and devalues it.

Imagine you run a Bitcoin exchange or other bisiness. Without banking support your business is at risk being shut anytime as you need a bank to accept fiat deposits, pay suppliers and staff.
Also clients want simplicity and speed on purchasing coins to use any bitcoin service, without faster payments you have to use sepa or account transfers, both are rubbish and is a major barrier to the viability of businesses being better than existing systems.
Simply put, another country is looking likely to become the digital currency capital because UK banks are using their monopoly to aggressively keep it at bay even though the government is being very sensible about it all.

Kudos to you on making a great password storage system and highlight bitcoin can buy more things paypal and others cant!
I'm sure you've got feature requests galore but in case it helps may I share a few in case it helps
* Please support iOS/Android platforms.  99% of the time I have my mobile on me and would much rather that stored the PWs than my desktop I can't carry around. 
* In the DB field I'd recommend adding a couple extra standard fields namely... epoch_time_created, epoch_time_last_used.    I've been using another PW system for a while now and found I had to customise it to have these fields which are incredibly valuable.  I.e. It's really helpful when you sync/merge two pw files or knowing what is legacy.
* I too would suggest a name change, the impression of trust is everything with these things ;)  Yes it's open source to verify but most users can't be bothered compiling it and just trust your site downloads if they match the MD5/SHA256 but won't go that far if the name scares them.

I think BU is a terrible idea but UASF is probably worse.
The uasf website is so light on credible technical detail is telling how that it has any traction.
Convince me ripping out and bypassing the main security feature is smart and i can change my mind.
There is a lot of mob mentality going on here with clear social engineering of new reddit accounts, the fact is only an idiot would trust their coin transactions on a significantly weaker chain.
If i were a malicious miner with a majority i could screw up that fork easily to return power to the main one( eg mine empty block after empty block forking the chain daily, hold back releasing 100 blocks and release giving the mother of all disasters for exchanges, perhaps do this intentionally while shorting it to take suckers money who left it on the uasf branch)
Uasf is an alt coin and disingenuous to say it is bitcoin because its not.  Let people buy into it if they want but it is not bitcoin by the definition of what stops social engineering efforts like uasf.
I don't appreciate being called ignorant without examples and i do have an open mind, just show me the testnet setup where this is shown to have actually worked.
The only way segwit is happening on bitcoin is when miners lose money, that means people selling their coins for an alt or fiat.
The fact that btc is still increasing in value means its nit happening anytime soon.
Not trying to be controversial, i do want segwit, i dont want bu but just explaining my point of view... and no im not a paid shill.

Agreed on the donation and the sum of money is rather pitiful for what the code is but what I like is it took no effort to place that address.  People sharing their code as a selfless act to help everyone,whilst they get kudos and zen their kind deed,  having an optional address up they may also get some tradeable value too.
I'm not too surprised the sum is quite low as Bitcoin is still a novelty that not many people actually own and he is asking for donations rather than support or licensing fees which would clearly generate more.  
The only other ways I know of donating money before were via paypal and bank transfer.  Bank transfers require posting sensitive info so couldn't really be done leaving only payment portals like Paypal.
If donations accumulate $316 in 2 years it's just not worth the effort of adding a paypal donate button but copy/paste a bitcoin address is like seconds of work so probably is?  I may be delirious though as not had my morning coffee...
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:43:41
They're all good questions and you have some founded reservations and some reservations simply from the unknown ahead which I'd suggest being open minded about but wise to also keep some caution.
1. Firstly bitcoin doesn't have to be a replacement for a fiat currency, just can be used to back one (or many) like the IMFs SDR asset but accessible to anyone.   That said, there is volatility simply because it's very early days of the technology... most people don't even understand it's a limited resource of 2,100,000,000,000,000 units for instance.
  As more people discover and use it, the value appreciates.  This leads to speculation investment which increases volatility as adoption rates happen in surges simply by how technology awareness happens.  Since shorting has appeared a few years ago the volatility has improved but bitcoin is still a low liquidity market compared to a larger stable country's national currency.  Keep in mind smaller countries already find bitcoin is a far more stable store of value than their local currency however and as the strapline goes, with the exception of just one year, Bitcoin has been and remains the worlds best performing currency year on year since it's inception over 8 years now.  A 10% +/- rate change is actually quite low for something so dramatic.
2. There is no doubt people attempting to influence the market, this happens regardless of commodity.  Bitcoin is more susceptible to knee jerk reactions at the moment to offer large swings but the mining system is no really related to the price increase other than if they play the market.  It's in the miners interest to have valuation go up so they'd not 'cash out'
3.  Yes new technology allows for risk of new issues to appear and it's almost certain people will find exploits however the damage they do is somewhat limited to individuals as any system wide issue is protected by the blockchain positive feedback loop.    That all said, segwit is being pioneered on litecoin so most likely any issues would be discovered there first before it's even available to start using on bitcoin.

When the blocks are consistently full we need bigger blocks... right now it's is still working well and when that limit is reached it will raise more awareness of the system's continual adoption as people freak out only to realize they have to pay more for their transactions like any supply/demand market.
Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-bigger blocks via an algorithm... just saying that bitcoin is working well at the moment and will be interesting to see what happens when the limits are reached as no one knows the outcome of human factors here.  I.e. do we really need to raise it if bitcoin is merely the settlement layer?
It won't break bitcoin, worst case scenario I can envisage is price stagnation and increased mining fees where eventually the blocksize is increased if it becomes problematic and effects the exchange price negatively.
Best case, it will inspire layers on top of bitcoin like LN, shards, and more importantly trust in sidechains that will allow the system to flourish in the many real use-case scenarios we all want.  
Keep in mind R3 is not going to be a shitty alt coin, it's going to be more like Alpha or Ethereum so in order for bitcoin to remain technically superior we need the capability of innovation in bitcoin based systems otherwise it could well reside itself in history as the first digital currency rather than be the digital currency.
I'm still very much pro bitcoin vs any other currency out there but this block size debate is just a storm in a teacup.

Start simple.  If you have a month, plan on what you can do in a week and simply polish that.
As an easy start you could just visualise the bitcoin transactions happening on the internet. (blockchain.info gives you an API you can easily tap into).
Alternatively you could do something like detect a bitcoin payment and this invokes your java program to do something useful as a service.  21 inc may be of interest there.
If you're using java though you may find bitcoinj helpful.

I think this is a terminology error but I have to point out your shares are absolutely counted even if you never find a block in a pool.  Your shares are only recognised once someone in your mining pool finds a block however.  The tally of your shares in a pool is always absolutely being counted based on the hashes your equipment contributes.
If however someone runs their own node/pool and commands 0.001% of the power, they will only get 1 block in every 100,000 on average (or 1 block once every 2 years).  I.e. this is why people tend to use pools to smooth the reward payments out.

Hows about creating a coinmech that accepts bitcoin as well as nfc cards.  Vending machines can then be easily updated to use this digital version.  I know it's been done before but aim for mass production.  Should be easy enough to mix a rasperry Pi or equivalent + GSM card and a bit of server logic to determine price of payments and communicate this with the user.
If you make it, I'd appreciate being involved as something I've thought about doing myself ;)

Agreed, this will snowball when others start seeing what it does.  Fast take up by institutions during the usual 'bitcoin is dead' phase isn't going to happen, it's when people notice it is still very much going strong during the next financial mess that another boom/bust cycle is likely to happen.

Greenwallet allows for multiple accounts but all transactions are done via the blockchain so there is a nominal fee for each transfer.
Seems a very specialized use case you have there, should bitcoin become mainstream this will be  a great idea (assuming the company doesn't have access to the users funds) but right now it seems rather niche to save a few cents just for small internal transactions.
Should sidechains be proven to work this would be a perfect candidate for it.

Consider showing them it actually working... many people have never seen a transaction.
I use bitpay on the iPad and Bread wallet on the iPhone for my presentations.

You can get a WiFi mirror setup to show your iPhone to the projector for all to see what you're doing.
The demo takes 15 seconds and is the most valuable thing you can show.
Try not to talk about how bitcoin works but focus more what it does really well over the flawed existing system we live with.  I.e. you can publish the address anywhere, virtually no fees on transfers, finite global resource, instant transfer, store of value outside of private companies, etc...
If you mention mining, blocks, hashes, ECDSA you may well scare them off and it's not important... think how most people don't realize how cell tower packets are cleverly scheduled and encrypted for mobile phones.  It's truly amazing how it works but is irrelevant to its purpose of being able to talk to anyone around the world.

It's worth pointing out the halving is also a planned control to prevent mining becoming an environmental disaster.  
If each coin in the early days was worth $500, over $2,000,000 PER DAY could be spent on electricity securing the network and still be profitable. Due to the halving only $500,000 per day will be viable.

'IMF would need a large amount of bitcoins for its reserves, which could be difficult to obtain for anyone at the scale required.'
If it was fully anticipated bitcoin to get this much global attention only 3 years ago, I can see why they'd be confidently putting off buying any reserves until after next year's supply halving.

Not being funny but you asked for a source, he delivered a known media organisation, what more could they offer?
That said, I agree the sentence he received for running a website is vastly disproportionate to the crime he was found guilty of.  Even more so given a number of corrupt officials were later announced who seem to be doing less time that he is, the evidence provided indicated parallel construction may have been used to connect some obscure dots, hasn't stopped others appearing and finally that website probably reduced street crime.
That all said, he was involved, was knowingly guilty so is more a question of unfair sentencing of what he was found guilty of, the hearsay of attempted murder I believe he was never actually charged with so is a moot point.

Yes, it gives you a new address to receive on each time one is used. I believe it also spends all the funds at a given address that funds the transaction and sends the change to a new unused addresd.

This Chinese mining argument seems so ludicrous, can anyone explain what is wrong with my logic here because I don't see it as a real threat at all.
*IF* a centralised mining entity started filtering transactions to the blockchain, it would quickly become apparent.  This would lead to a few certain outcomes.
Firstly it would be considered an attack on the system, **the community would respond.** This means the bread wallet, mycelium, copay, circle's, bitstamp's, kraken, bitpay's of the world would have something to say.  If enough of them agree, mining becomes rather irrelevant.
A few obvious examples
* This could be hard fork changing the mining algorithm thereby completely ruining the attackers massive investment of ASICs and returning power to home based GPUs.  
* It may be upgrading the protocol so transactions are not visible to miners (blind transactions) so the miners can't filter them
This therefore makes the attack useless in the long run and only advantageous to temporarily increase/decrease bitcoin global price for local gain.  Generally this attack would lower the value of bitcoin thereby hurting the miners most, so would have to be a sponsored aspect to even consider this attack.  
As other countries outside of China find bitcoin useful to their economy, they may opt to subsidise electricity to run their own mining facility or have a mining facility on standby should such temporary attack be unacceptable.  
Generally I just can't see why China or any other country having a majority of the mining power would ever lead to more than a blip in the ecosystem so why is it perpetuated?

Given it costs over $500,000 per day in electricity and scalability solutions are only just being written I think bitcoin is growing too fast at the moment. 
After the halving the system only needs to double its users over the next 4 years to continue being successful. Right now it looks to do that in under a year yet again which is remarkable.

Can you share which wallet software you are using and the receive address? My guess would be your transaction had the malleability attack applied, this is nothing to worry about and is just someone reading new transactions and reposting them changing their IDs. This confuses wallet software that are following a single transaction id. It's probably the attacker is trying to screw up any shoddy software doing server payouts by applying the attack to all Bitcoin transactions to prevent highlighting who they are.
Ie your transaction(s) are totally fine but your wallet software is a tad confused during the 1st confirmation period.

It's perfectly safe to receive lots of unique transactions to a single address. The only issue with this is traceability, ie who made each of those 0.01btc payments??  For donations it doesn't matter because you're not relating each transaction to any specific sale or person, just receiving money.
When the donation site spends funds from that address they must post the corresponding public key on the blockchain. This is a tiny but tangible security risk in the world of quantum computers or someone someday cracking ecdsa whereby any funds remaining or subsequently send to that address could be at risk.  Generally address reuse is still incredibly secure but just prudent to protect against potential future issues or wallets that don't sign correctly.
It's fine to accept payments to same address, is considered wise to change the address only when you spend from it.

Your key generates the bitcoin address.
It will start with a '5' or '6' or it may be an HD seed than generates your keys. An HD seed starts with 'xpriv' or more commonly expressed as 12 words.
If you just have a bitcoin address you don't actually own the bitcoin since youre relying on someone else controlling your money.
Get an HD wallet like Electrum, mycelium, copay, jaxx, trezor or bread wallet would be my suggestions.  There are others too, but these seem reputable and you control the keys.

Perhaps something like user A wants to connect to bitmesh.  To do this they must send a text message to the bitmesh operator with the ID number on their screen (generated locally in javascript on User A's machine NOT the bitmesh machine).  When the bitmesh operator receives this message, they enter the ID number to their router to accept a connection with this ID.  The User A now transmits over it's ID and the public key of the bitcoin address it will eventually be paying with and the session can now begin just as you've got.
When user A requests information from the internet via bitmesh it creates a message such as this.
**"id:{ID} at epoch time 14234982 sent 80 bytes to 201.201.40.2:80"**
It gets a SHA256 hash of this message and signs it with the bitcoin private key that will eventually be used to pay for this.
User A sends this text message and signature to the bitmesh machine.  The bitmesh operator can now use the public key User A sent at the start of the connection to verify this signature and allow the data transfer to occur.
Now this would be recording the browsing habits of User A so instead of this entire message it could hash the URL first... perhaps a toggleable feature if the bitmesh operator doesn't mind not knowing. Alternatively User A should simply use a VPN...
Using this approach the bitmesh router owner can't fake the other persons transactions whilst at the same time it remains anonymous... unless User A does something wrong of course in which case the phone records can be obtained by the authorities to know who was making those transactions and whoever has that private key on their machine should be the only person who could have made the transactions.
Probably more holes than swiss cheese but feel like I should try to offer a possible solution give I'm being the trouble maker asking for it.

If they have shorted it, they have taken other users bitcoin and put them up for sale already temporarily increasing supply.
The price drops only if more choose to sell their coins later.  
Those shorters have to buy back again eventually which is going to push the price back up.
Alternatively others may decide to buy back in after the fiasco of forks subsides forcing shorters to buy in early to cover their losses creating even more demand.
I.e. there is $80 million of visible pending demand there....  question is what the invisible post 1st August demand will be.  Fascinating to watch, my hunch is demand will rise tomorrow as people shift their balances into BTC to get their free matched BCH and later sell BCH for more BTC.

Nothing prevents it other than unfortunately it's a bad idea to do in a centralised way and a decentralised one has issues...
E.g. someone stores a key=value pair of
* Alice = 1fa34542..23
* Bob = 3fa3a35aa...32
What prevents someone controlling that list modifying Alice's address to be the same as Bobs and stealing all of Alice's (edit: sorry tired) future payments ?
* Alice = 3fa3a35aa...32
* Bob = 3fa3a35aa...32
The trick is to have a decentralised version, e.g. Namecoin.  The complications with this is it's another layer of complexity that really needs helper libraries for mainstream adoption.  
But yes, you're absolutely right, this is needed for greater adoption.  
It may however be better to focus on building this feature into the Lightning Network protocol layer since this is intended for mainstream usage.
Bitcoin is probably brutally low level that only wallets should need to deal with under the hood.

No, i just think its weird that people arent aware how easy it is to go to aws or google compute and spin up a thousand nodes by a script. It's why consensus uses pow not say a hash of ip.  
The fact it jumped so quickly shows its likely a sybil show, seems weird it's not explained like that though...
I've read uasf.co again, my view remains that it can only work if the miners support it, I believe that site says as much too.  It also highlights node count is meaningless.
Why are people so afraid of a different opinion? It makes no difference to me, was just voicing concern that the main problem doesn't appear to have been resolved, majority of miners are not supporting segwit for whatever reason.

Once you've written down the 12 words backup seed you can delete the wallet from your phone/computer/everywhere.  
When you want to access your funds again, just reinstall a compatible HD wallet and type in those 12 words and you get access to all your money again.  
Try it first with a tiny bit of btc to get comfortable with deleting the wallet, it's a scary thing the first time you do it but you get confident the system works after you've tried with a few cents.

Their business is run in USD not Bitcoin, this would be no different than purchasing the item from Japan and getting a refund.
Or you'll be stung by an exchange rate.
In btc it's potentially so volatile that it becomes feasible to purchase a TV in btc and request a refund in a month if a btc is now doubled in value.
Ie people would game the system or get upset at the exchange rate.
In time as it becomes more stable this becomes less of an issue and refunds in btc are not just viable, they are preferred due to lower overheads. Right now we're a long way to go before it would be sensible

Have you considered just asking for your money back or selling your share if you've lost faith?
Legal action is stifling and unproductive in this startup space, it ends up just stealing everyone else's good investment who still believe in the project while killing the teams chance of success for lawyers fees and settlement costs.

You have to adhere to the NewYork BitLicense to operate a bitcoin company there.  It's expensive to do so only wealthy institutions will be able to offer bitcoin services.
The downside is the innovation from small startups will go to every other state/country due to these high costs, the upside is the remaining ones are likely to have deeper pockets for marketing and doing things professionally.

Pretty clear that at the moment there isn't anything superior.. yet.
Bitcoin has it's fair share of issues to work out, if solves one of these big issues in another coin before sidechains appear or before the flaws are fixed in bitcoin that alt coin **may** gain enough traction to overtake bitcoin.
I for one would consider a coin that had a nullify outputs option such that if my funds were stolen I'd have a period of time, set by myself, that I can vaporise those coins such that whilst I've lost them so would the hacker vastly reducing any incentive for attempted theft.
After the set period of time those coins are now spendable by anyone and the vapourising trick doesn't work but at least there's the drive to not steal someone's coins as it's known they'll be instantly worthless.

There are only three sensible reasons I can think of to sell..
1. If you need USD now and therefore have to suffer a worse exchange rate.
2. You want out of cryptospace forever.
3. You're confident another cryptocoin will be taking over bitcoin's leading position.
The reasons that would be terrible to sell now
1. You think the value will drop further so you will buy back at a lower price.  This is gambling, no one knows the floor value or when it could turn.  It is nothing more intelligent than flipping a coin.
2. You think it's safer to pull your coins out before a split.  This is probably the dumbest reason of them all because there are two scenarios.  Firstly no significant hardfork happens (i.e. it resolves itself before 100 blocks are made), this is typically what has always happened and how bitcoin is designed to work.  Second scenario is very unlikely but potentially a split happens beyond 100 blocks.  This would double everyone's coins who owns bitcoin at this stage.  The chance of this is incredibly slim since it's not like ETH/ETC split where no one gives a crap about two chains existing.  In bitcoin world, miners jump on the most powerful chain since otherwise they will lose money but still have to pay the same high electricity fees.  Miners are doing it to earn money, not for the greater good... this selfish behaviour of working on the strongest coin is again by design and why weaker coins inevitably lose value and disappear over time.
There is however a twist... btc currently can't scale.  If this hurdle doesn't get fixed there is a risk of another cryptocurrency that can scale overtaking it.  At the moment we have LTC set up for lightning network support and byteball is taking a non-blockchain approach to solve scaling.  Not trying to pump these coins (as yes I have invested in those too) but just saying keep options open.
Taking USD now is probably unwise unless you need the local cash IMHO.

If people want to back segwit, isn't it more sensible for individuals to exchange coins from one cryptocurrency to another that does support the features they want?  
Seems changing the guts of a working live system without miner buy-in is somewhat dangerous, why not let LTC and others adopt this risk?  If it works out and people migrate to LTC, eventually the miners will agree it's worthwhile if the BTC value drops by much.
If the change/feature is 'meh', btc continues as strong as before and nothing is jeapordised on the main chain.
I'd love to see segwit but I'm pro cryptocurrency evolution rather than intelligent design.  
My fear is should UASF actually work it seems to highlight bitcoin's main security protocol can be undermined (no pun intended).
Whilst I'd love to hear your thoughts I equally don't want to distract since I know the awesome work you're doing and can't wait for sidechains.

I'm a little perplexed why it's locked you out from the backup option but you can see the balance?  
My ios Mycelium has no such feature that I can see whereby you have some access but not all.
I am on version V14 (Settings-&gt;About) if that helps.
You can also see if you can export diagnostic data, this may shed some light on it.  It won't export the xpriv keys or seed however but may see if you have access.
You can contact ios for help too I believe (or  telegram)
You say you're locked out on sending the funds, have you incorrectly attempted sends or something else that could have locked you?  Again, I'm not aware of any PIN or 2FA style setup for iOS mycelium so not sure how it's got stuck yet... I think that's probably worth resolving first.

Instead of having keys to a car you just have your mobile phone that signs a message with your private key.
Now when you sell your car you change the public key to the new owners public key.  The car will now unlock to the new owner(s) but not the old one.
If stored in a decentralised blockchain the db doesn't need to be maintained by Ford.  The keys can also work between car manufacturers in a globally standard way.  Basically removes the need for having fobs being made and could allow for different usage types such as "Pay as you drive" or shared car ownership.  Also the insurance companies may hold another key that would allow a car to be started or not, would mean you can only drive cars you're insured on and it would automatically know who was insured.
For the car owner it means they don't have to carry their keys around with them, free to get replacement keys, ensure the car service history is made available globally... probably quite a lot of things that can be done with it.

Because just like cash, you shouldn't need to concern yourself with where the coins came from or what they are spent by someone you trade with.

The 3 TPS figure is very misleading (I believe it was 7 but is somewhat moot point) this is an arbitrary limit based on the superficial upper block size limit that has been in place, it will be increased as of Bitcoin 0.1.0 I believe so this figure will be much higher now even though we've not even approached this limit yet.  The upper theoretical limit without this is vastly higher.
The hashing power is rather removed from transactions themselves but instead is correlated with the exchange price. 
If a bitcoin is only worth $2 and 25 bitcoins are mined per block (25btc x 24hrs x 6=3600btc per day)  that means miners can collectively spend up to $7200 per day and it's profitable.  Beyond that and they'd lose money if they turned on their machines so perfectly balances with exchange price * coins produced per day.
When demand of bitcoin is fairly constant (right now it's not and wildly fluctates with speculation and a growing userbase) but when it is constant you can see it halves which effectively is reducing inflation which is currently around 14%.  That high inflation rate is masked by the volatility and new adopters but over time it should become more obvious and when it's less than 4% I wouldn't be surprised to see larger institutions adopting bitcoin for store of value over national banks that suffer higher inflation rates.
You're right that the hashing is overkill for the transactions but it is perfectly correct for the bitcoin price as people see it's future utility value is likely to be much higher than $1000/btc if the experiment succeeds hence why people are paying speculative exchange rate values at the moment while it's utility value is quite cheap.

What's quite funny is if people are selling because of a potential split ahead they've misunderstood what will happen.  If they withdraw their coins from an exchange before 1st August and a split like eth/etc happens those people get free money since their funds are available to spend separately on both chains.
I'm all in pre 1st Aug.  Post Aug I'm either back into bitcoin if it has segwit or moving to litecoin that already supports segwit/lightning.

Depends on the escrow service used.
If it's a centralised one you'd have to go onto that website to enter the address where that website will verify it is the entity in control of the address.  (I'm not aware of any services still running that do this however)
If it's a decentralised escrow (most likely usecase), i.e. native bitcoin escrow, it will be a P2SH address I believe... this means it will start with a '3' not a '1'.
To do a native escrow you'd have had to send your public key to the seller for them to include in the escrow script.
This means the seller needs to send you the redemption script BEFORE you send the money there.  If not, it's probably not escrow because how would you ever redeem it?
With that redeem script you can verify your public key is one of the 1 of necessary redemption keys used.  This would typically be a 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 multisignature address depending on if you have an independent 3rd party involved.
With the redemption script you can visit places like this to verify your key is in there...

MyCelium is great for being able to import paper walllets, secure and follows the standards.
BreadWallet is easiest to use but has a non-standard seed.
CoPay is the most advanced and allows for testnet coins, awesome wallet but hard to use compared to the above (takes like 6 clicks to pay someone)
Jaxx is excellent for holding lots of different types of bitcoin and being able to trade back and forth with LTC or Ethereum for instance.
All the above wallets are HD wallets that use a seed approach so all are good for remaining safe in a fork.

Yes but there are levels of security here...
A random 16 digit password is more than sufficient to safely lock your wallet nearly as much as the 100 character one. Ie no one is going to brute force attack that.
The weakness is therefore not the password length but the fact your computer is on the Internet and you could get a bad mix of 
'keylogger' + 'file access'(via team viewer/vnc/rdp/ssh/dropbox/etc...) + determined bitcoin hacker.
A determined hacker who knows you have funds on that machine could now target that wallet going through your key logs but would have to be pretty targeted at a guess!
It is a risk but a very small one if you keep your machine updated and use good antivirus software.  I'd say it's safe enough for a few thousand dollars.
Beyond that you want a Trezor or offline storage (bitaddress.org) or offline machine/electrum sort of approach to be very secure.  
Basically have a hot wallet and a secure wallet just like you do with cash.

Will wait to see what happens after 1st August, if Bitcoin doesn't get Segwit the easiest option is people just dump their BTC and buy LTC which is basically bitcoin codebase but already supports Lightning Network capabilities that allows for vast scaling as well as a few other advances.
ByteBall and IOTA may address the scalability too, they have opted for a Tangle rather than a Blockchain to prevent double spends but allows for vastly more txs, potentially eclipsing everything else if they get sharding right.
(Notice, I would not recommend IOTA just yet because their new client blanked my balance to 0.  They say they'll fix it but holding my breath for any word from them and been over a week)

Yes your coins are safe on hardware wallets and forks are nothing to worry about, it's part of the design.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:29:58
So you're probably right about most of this.  There are some options however...
Firstly LN and other layer 2 solutions which do not require every transaction to hit the blockchain.  This benefits from giving instant confirmations, low fees and vastly scalable.  The disadvantage is people have to lock in bitcoin to their payment channel, it's yet to be seen how userfriendly this is.  It must be trivial to stand a chance against existing payment systems.
Secondly there are treechains/sidechains and other approaches coming online that do exactly what you describe.  They move funds to a new database so they only interact within this subset, a bit like sharding.  The funds can later be moved back to the main chain with a tx-fee to allow spending on another sidechain (or main chain).  This can scale almost infinitely but at the cost of complexity, only a standardised interface/system to know which sidechain to step into is needed for this to become scalable.
Thirdly there is the route of alt coins.  This is much like the sidechain approach except it's free floating exchange value.  This is the sort of setup we have with fiat currencies currently, not ideal but it works.  If there were fixed exchange rate alts existing this could scale.
Finally bitcoin itself can scale much further than it is doing right now.  There is no reason everyone has to run a full node and no technical upper limit of 1Mb other than the consensus rules everyone agrees enforces this.  Also bitcoin may have other scaling solutions at the base layer level we've not seen yet.  I expect forinstance using the merkle tree a node doesn't have to track every transaction on the network just the utxo set and the merkle trees.  
I guess ultimately what I'm saying is if there is a drive for a scalable solution a good one will eventually be found.

Sorry, I'm struggling to follow what you mean... it's probably just I've not had enough coffee or something.
What I'm saying is bitcoin is merely another currency, if a business gets hit with a cryptolocker virus they will need to spend funds (euros, usd, btc) to get their files back...   I'm not sure what that has to do with a company using bitcoin for their own purposes though?  People get hit with cryptolocker viruses with or without bitcoin knowledge or usage?
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:01:47
Depends on the software you're using.
You typically have more than 1 bitcoin address, actually each time you spend or receive bitcoin you should get a new address to use.  The old addresses still work on receiving funds.  It's a privacy/security feature that the addresses change.
If you are using the bitcoind client software you need to make sure you regularly back up your wallet.dat file as it creates batches of 100 addresses for you at a time.
It's therefore far easier to use an HD wallet where you have one seed number (expressed as 13 words usually) and you only need remember that and it derives all your bitcoin addresses for you automatically.

Not sure why you're being downvoted, for a hot wallet a mobile solution is far more sensible than a connected windows based one.  Firstly you have it on you when you need it, secondly you can scan QR codes rather than rely on copy/paste not being compromised, thirdly you have sandboxing by default on mobile devices.
Sadly there are still too many holes in all the OS's to feel safe with any but I'd pick iOS as the safest after hardware wallets so far.
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:30:48
You may like to upgrade.
I'm guessing you have the fee set correctly so perhaps your transaction is being rejected by the network due to the recent move over to 'low S' signatures only to prevent spamming attacks and the error message shown assumes it's being rejected due to the fee being too low.
Backup, upgrade and try again.  Alternatively you can try a new transaction as I'd expect 50% of them to work.

The problem is you know what a duck is, and you know what a beaver is... along comes a platypus and people say 'it's a duck because it's got a bill and lays eggs', others say 'it's a beaver because it has a flat tail and swims under the water'.
Clearly both are right in matching the criteria but yet both are very wrong.  
Bitcoin is neither a currency nor a commodity but people ask to pigeon hole it in concepts we are familiar with which is why it's a problem.
Basically it can be considered a commodity in that it's a finite resource, mined and tangible value that can be exchanged for currency.  It is not a commodity in that you can't easily buy/sell it directly on all the large exchanges (yet).  
The issue is it can be exchanged so quickly, virtually and directly between two parties in a way that no commodity before it could ever have been traded.  This makes it a gold standard currency which is why the confusion happens.
Realistically it's not a currency in that no country controls it, no taxes are collected by a country (although arguably miners take a tax to process transactions so adds another layer of complexity).  On the flip side people will trade goods for it directly and transactions are faster than bank transfers.  Also it is a unit of value globally accepted yet not backed by any physical asset just like a fiat currency.
Bitcoin is it's own thing.  A currency can be implemented with bitcoin.  A bitcoin also has characteristics that match a commodity.  
The existing laws were written before this was invented hence it's wrong to pigeon hole it into one or the other yet for the best part it is probably considered a commodity at the moment... this is likely to change when Lightning Network is available and people increasingly use it for daily transactions.

You'd do well getting an HD wallet (like Trezor, Electrum, MyCelium, etc..) and withdrawing your funds from that exchange.
Firstly it's safer since you now own it.
Secondly if there is a new coin spin off with segwit and using a new PoW you have literally doubled up your coins.  (Albeit one coin will be worth a fraction of the other, just like the ETC/ETH split).
If you leave your coins on an exchange you don't actually own them and they may pick just one of those chains for you.

You were told to write down carefully before you could even proceed in using the trezor which makes me curious how you didn't know this but happen to be in ownership of one.

This pin is merely a safety precaution to slow a thief so the owner has time to move all the funds from it.

It's simply an incredibly secure and robust database open to everyone with the main purpose to store bitcoin balances at bitcoin addresses.  There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin units in this database so is the first a scarce finite digital resource that can't be copied, faked or disputed.  Bitcoin transactions happen instantly from anywhere in the world just like email hence why it has an exchange value in every country.  To transfer funds from one bitcoin address to another in this database you simply need to know the password to your bitcoin address which a bitcoin wallet does for you.

Can anyone explain how Namecoin does merge mining with bitcoin (to someone who understands bitcoin mining)?
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:21:59
I disagree so allow me to elaborate on my reasoning.  
Firstly bitcoin's value is still holding strong, it isn't in freefall, it isn't stuck and there's no fraud happening.  Bitcoin is THE solid cryptocurrency people trust, screwing with it's rules on a whim is very risky.
"But what about segwit, or larger blocks, or snarks, or drive chains, or ... whatever"  
These are all potentially amazing things and may be essential for mass market cryptocurrency needs but Bitcoin does not need it, the proof is in the valuation.  
What Bitcoin needs to do is to reflect value safely in a non-trusting fashion.
"But bitcoin is hindered from evolving!"
This is the first reaction when people get emotionally involved.  It's easy to do, heck I'm there as well but take a step back and look at the bigger picture.  
If a digital currency were to offer SegWit and bitcoin didn't, would that make all the good money move to this new crypto?  Potentially, but let's look at the facts.  Litecoin has Segwit and yes it's market share is ever increasing but not dramatically.  This to me means segwit is not a killer feature... yet.
So if someone released LN on litecoin, we show it works, will people swap to litecoin?  Again, perhaps.  If they do, only when bitcoin's valuation drops dramatically on a death spiral would it make the change sensible to prevent a freefall to 0.  
Clearly this hasn't happened therefore those changes are not important, at least not important to bitcoin.
Doing something as dramatic as swapping the PoW scheme to cuckoo or other such mechanism is the nuclear option.  It's only needed if bitcoin is broken and at $2500/btc people (not miners, actual users) are saying bitcoin is working better than ever before.
Because of that, anyone swapping PoW is an alt coin in my mind and I'd short them for some easy money.  Not being confrontational, just explaining what any logical trader would do in another ETH/ETC event.
So how do we progress?  If people believe bitcoin is stalled/failing/needs a pow change, they should sell their coins and buy an alt that has whatever feature they think is a clear improvement for bitcoin.  If enough people do that either the new coin gains the  spot with the previous bitcoin users OR bitcoin eventually loses so much value that it's in the miners interests to fix whatever is hindering bitcoin.
**tldr; let's be sensible and encourage evolution not intelligent design**

That said I've not used them since they upgraded to support HD derived keys.  When I tried to port my old private keys to their new HD wallet their JS script kept crashing.  Sent support email and no replies so became unusable to me.

I don't understand the issue, if someone thinks bitcoin is broken without segwit why don't they just sell their ₿ and buy Ltc or whatever chain that does support it?  
If enough people start doing this the bitcoin miners will change their stance or go out of business.  That is how the economic majority control bitcoin, not by a mob shouting loudly.
A UASF is just downright ludicrous... The idea of bypassing THE key security feature of a blockchain and it surviving the inevitable hard fork as the weaker candidate is wishful thinking at best. 
Don't get me wrong, I want segwit but yet to see how a uasf is viable especially when easier options exist.

My perception is using addresses is too low level... especially as a user remembering your own addresses, in time we shouldn't really need to know about them.  HD wallets are a massive step in the right direction at least for a user controlling their funds.
The next step is solving a way to send money to a mnemonic like "john and know it translates to a bitcoin address only he has access too.  Namecoin seems the obvious solution if it wasn't for the issue of squatters.

It's in the protocol already... may like to take a look at coinb.in,
You can create an address with a timelock on it whereby you can't spend the funds until a block number or epoch time in future.
10 years is a long time in cryptocurrency though, we are only 8 years into the experiment so far.  I'd be very nervous doing something like this with any significant value but it should work.
Make sure you create a tx to spend them (or take a copy of coinb.in website) at the same time just so it simplifies the process for whoever is going to spend them in 10 years!

Thanks for finding reference links, really appreciate it.  I've had a read through and as luck would have it I've got native iOS dev experience so can sympathise with Jaxx's CTO's explanation as being solid with no urgency to change anything.
Unless the iphone is jailbroken or the user intentionally installs bogus certificates I'm unaware of any vulnerability that could be used to gain access to this seed other than creating an app in the same domain as the jaxx namespace... I find it unlikely  that Apple would approve such an app attempting this blatant attack vector but yes it can't be 100% ruled out.  (You could also assume if it happened it would be easy to catch the culprit since you have to sign any submissions to apple)
This attack vector could also be applied to any iOS wallet, especially if open source and the seed is encrypted with a fixed text string.  One thing they could do is encrypt the master seed with a pin which would still allow cross device sharing but is probably just icing on the cake rather than a necessity.
Happy to be proved wrong if someone can share the exact attack vector details but what is referenced in cointelegraph seems most likely scare mongering at this stage.

As others have said, with Coinbase they are holding your bitcoin for you.  If they disappear or are compromised you can lose all your funds.
Bitcoin is designed so you control the funds directly without needing to trust another company.  If you have significant funds... e.g. &gt; 2BTC I'd highly recommend a hardware wallet like Trezor for peace of mind as those will ensure your keys are kept safe.   
The principal of a wallet is it should only handle storing the keys (i.e. the passwords) to the addresses in the globally accessible blockchain database.  I.e. with those passwords you can control sending those funds from any computer in the world.  Coinbase don't give you those keys hence important to move your funds out of there.
A few good wallets are MyCelium, Breadwallet, Copay, Jaxx, Electrum.
If you own the keys, you will control your bitcoin regardless of any fork and in the incredibly unlikely event of a split you will double your coins since you will now control bitcoin on both versions of the blockchain.
For peace of mind, with talk of UASF, etc... even in Coinbase your funds will be safe, it's just they may opt for one chain or the other which in the vastly unlikely event of a sustained chain split.

Make it incredibly simple to buy/sell bitcoin instantly for newbies.   None of this 24hr verification required.
This process is so laborious that it is hindering adoption.
Secondly make multisig wallets the standard where you can put maximum caps on spenditure and/or use products like Trezor to give physical protection.
Get a simple side chain open source example out there that other chains can build from.  This will allow faster innovation in the micropayments, insurance contracts, datastorage, better escrow systems and other features we've not even thought about yet.
More services offering bitcoin as a safely tradeable commodity on existing stock exchanges.
Finally wallets that offer a simple common escrow system to make it practical to use any purchase.

Full nodes, yes absolutely they check the full blockchain, transactions and mining hashes.

I disagree, this is a great way to get seed money for a new venture.  If it succeeds you can repay those who believed in the product so they're not out of pocket and stand to perhaps even make some money from it too.
I don't donate to many projects as the risk of losing your money is 100% guaranteed which simply sucks from a backers perspective.  There are many projects that are great ideas and simply need a little investment to make their kernel to grow from.
Showing your micro is profitable enables the traditional VC money to be brought in later as the rocket fuel.  
No professional VC would invest in a startup, business angels perhaps but not a VC.
Btw it is legal to micro invest in many countries, the UK recently changed its laws to allow this too so will be seeing more of this happening in future.

I really feel for you but you may find some small element of comfort in that you pioneering with using bitcoin at this stage is helping everyone get a better grip on security best practices.
Sounds like you were targeted specifically, not a blanket email so I'd be cautious what other information they have on you and start changing all your passwords beginning with Coinbase, Facebook, twitter and blockchain.
Please also note, the attack vector I explained is only one approach.  Another is they are actually able to remotely watch what you're doing... if you have TeamViewer or other VNC system installed I'd be suspicious of that.
Have you installed any software recently or signed up to any services recently with the same email address?

Bitcoin can't be counterfeit because any individual doesn't control the shared global database.
The database with everyone's balances in is replicated on 1000's of computers. If 1 person modified their version of the db or created an invalid transaction to do something dodgy like credit themselves bits from nowhere, that change is simply ignored by the other 999+ computers.
If the change is ignored by others it can't even be considered to enter the decentralised bitcoin blockchain which can be thought of as the single truth global db.  This ledgers history (the blockchain) is uneditable without spending more in electricity than was spent since the point in time it was created.  (This is the new invention bit!)
Currently bitcoin uses near $1,000,000 per day on electricity ensuring it's history is vastly more secure than any bank or private network db/private blockchain.
Tldr: yes banking systems can be compromised by a malicious db change, bitcoin can't.

A virtual currency is some arbitrary number in a database held by some corporation.  You can modify that number by simply adding/subtracting the value as and when you like.
Virtual currencies have no upper limit, no rules or scarcity.  Essentially virtual currencies are worthless.
Bitcoin however has value because it is finite with the protocol laws determining there can never be more than 2,100,000,000,000,000 units ever.  Doesn't matter how much people bitch/moan about it, this figure can not change, this unique fact is why bitcoin is the first resource on the internet that can not be copied and precisely why it demands an ever increasing valuation.
Digital currencies essentially mean they have a provable upper cap (deterministic m1 value) and so far we only know how to do this with a decentralised blockchain which uses proof of work. (edit: or by using a centralised entity that can be trusted like a central bank... but this can never be global since it is influenced by the nation that owns it and therefore is based purely on trust whereas bitcoin solves this trust problem) There are other clones of bitcoin that use this same approach but the network effect means typically only will be recognised as global value and so far bitcoin continues to leading this.

You may like to post the address that has your funds in, just gives reassurance to people they aren't wasting their time.
Next are you sure this was breadwallet you used and not another HD wallet?  I know it probably is breadwallet since you say you never logged out but have to ask because BreadWallet's HD scheme is different from the standard.
Can you create a new BreadWallet and say what receive address you get from that?  People can verify they are getting the same address as you.
Also did you ever see the funds appear in BreadWallet?  If not, is there any chance when you pasted your address to receive the funds to that some malware put their address in instead?  You can verify this by trying to copy/paste another address from bread wallet into say some webpage and make sure it matches.
Worst case scenario you can probably find tools online to extract the private keys breadwallet makes with your seed.  (Don't do this online!).  If you can create the address from the private key that matches that of the funds you can install MyCelium and paste that private key into the coldstorage area to get the funds back.  I would only start this route as a last resort though.
So in order.
1. Try reinstalling Breadwallet with your seed again.
2. Check the address it generates matches your receive address.  If it does no need to panic you have the funds, it's just the app is being daft.    If it doesn't match, try the copy/paste of the address into a browser and see if it pastes what you expect or if there's malware rewriting it.
3. Share your results and people can help.
As long as you haven't got malware on your device you're probably fine so keep calm ;)

The miners don't have people's private keys.  Without a private key number it's impossible to create the signature number required for a valid transaction.  This means if they just made up some bogus signature and put the bogus entry in a block everyone elses clients would see the entire block as invalid so the hash value the miners generate would be irrelevant.  
It's pretty darn robust ;)

trybtc.com is a great first place to learn.
If it's casually showing someone in the pub just tell them to open  and that will download the most popular wallet for that type of device.  Once installed you can send them some bits.
I wanted to find a way to get an app to download and automatically receive some bits for them to play with but not figured out a way this can happen other than building a custom wallet app where people have to pay to download it and include a few $'s in there to begin with.

Segwit is an enhancement to bitcoin that allows for a lot of new features.  Enabling it however means new risks with the new opportunities and some like to be conservative in changing the leading currency.  The decision on if segwit will be adopted is down to the miners, currently the majority of mining power does not support segwit hence it's not enabled... yet.
The reason miners don't support it is somewhat speculative but one highly likely suggestion is they it would break an enhancement added to the bitmain miners, the machines that power ~70% of the network. 
Either way segwit has been activated in Litecoin so is a great testing ground to make sure it's all smooth sailing if/when it's activated in bitcoin.  If segwit isn't activated in bitcoin it's likely litecoin will become more mainstream over time since it enables a lot of features people want (low transaction costs, future extendability, maleability fixes, more efficient pruning, etc...)
Is it feasible to mine bitcoin?  Yes absolutely.  Most people don't have the money to invest in the bitcoin hardware necessary (s9's) but you can absolutely still do it.  The problem is it doesn't make as much value as simply buying and holding bitcoin which is a lot easier for people to do.
As for where the 'bitcoins' come from.  All bitcoins are is like a value in an excel spreadsheet where the row number is the address and the cell contains the numeric value of bitcoins at that address.  A wallet just holds the passwords to spend the coins held at the address.   The excel file itself is that blockchain thing which every node has a copy of... I.e. you can think of them as being created by simply adding 12.5 to a cell and everyone agrees the person could change that cell because it's the rules of how mining works.  (I'm dramatically over simplifying here as it's not actually addresses but transactions stored but it's easier to visualise with this analogy)
The mining is a way to randomly pick someone from around the world who can credit themselves 12.5 bitcoin every 10 minutes.  
Home mining however is probably not practical, certainly not if you want to earn more than a few dollars of value a month.  The fact you're asking questions about where they come from makes me think it would be wise to read up about bitcoin mining, mining pools and electricity costs first before going out investing in the hardware (and for the love of everything don't invest in cloud mining as those are the ponzi scams!)
Enjoy the experiment, it's a crazy ride you've got involved in.

Yes, I'd suggest the safest way is just wait until it finishes syncing.  You can extract the private keys out and import/sweep them into another wallet app but I'd only recommend this when you're happy with using bitcoin.
(For instance importing private keys to electrum is a bad idea since it breaks the purpose of the restore from a seed value.  Far better to just send your bitcoin to the new wallet address, i.e. sweep them)
For reference electrum is the most use rfriendly local computer wallet I've used so far.  Multibit was good but I prefer electrums simplicity.
On devices there are a few options, if you click ( it will detect your device and take you to the most popular bitcoin wallet software on the official store you can choose to install.
I suggest this autofwd link to anyone new to bitcoin as it's confusing where to start with so many options floating around.

Are you seriously telling me private corporations who's purpose is to earn money act ethically???
@_date: 2015-02-04 10:45:29
Good question but there appears to be no single answer as it depends on the purpose.
If it's website based javascript is a definite requirement to know.  
If it's back end server side, your choice is
* PHP - nice and easy.  You need to be careful about which plugins you use that may open up security exploits.  Sometimes PHP is seen as micky mouse stuff but given Facebook was originally written with it I'd not dismiss it either.  For a newbie, PHP is probably the best place to start.
* NodeJS - This is awesome because it allows websockets (2 way push/pull communication between web browser and server where as most are just pull data systems).  NodeJS is used for blockchain.info and other popular sites so has shown it can be fit for purpose.  The downside is firstly it's harder to grasp than PHP, everything is asynchronous, harder to debug and typically takes more code to do the same thing that can be done in PHP.  It also doesn't have type casting so you can do really scary shit like "010" == 16 I believe so you need to be very careful with security on it.
* Java - This is more dedicated server stuff, it's pretty good but you'll be writing a lot more code than you would in PHP and have to handle a lot of fringe cases.  Memory manangment is also a consideration but as long as you know what you're doing it's pretty darn good!
* C/C++ - This is more for working on the bitcoin reference client or an incredibly purpose build server where you have a lot of experience with the above technologies (or were a C/C++ programmer before).  It takes longest to write with, open to causing server crashes because you control memory allocation and makes maintenance costly as people who code this demand higher salaries and will take 10x longer to write what a Node or PHP developer could do.  If however you need speed or low level control or absolute memory handling C is the best route.
Personally I keep C/C++ for game development or embedded systems, I wouldn't touch it for bitcoin servers as you're opening yourself up to costly development as you need to grow.
* C# - It's good for average standard game development, game logic or making tools in windows.
* Python is useful for tests and some server work, I've not done much with python other than simple scripts so probably shouldn't comment on it.  The idea writing a server in Python does seem odd to me but wouldn't be surprised if people had done this.
TL/DR: I'd recommend for server development PHP to begin with, NodeJS if you're serious, Java if you've got some cash and C++ if you're a financial institution.  For website stuff I'd focus on javascript :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:57:09
I believe the key difference is that with multi-sig each party doesn't need to reveal their private key but instead sign the transaction.
With SSSS you need to provide the N pieces of the puzzle  to a trusted party to decode the content (i.e. the private key).  This means with SSSS you couldn't use the private key again since the other party now knows the solution where as multisig would still be secure.

It's feedback system where you will only ever make enough to just be viable if you have cheap electricity.
The catch is you need to include market manipulation in mining these days, if you don't know how that works I'd say you'll make less mining than simply buying bitcoin.
Mining these days is best done on alt coins and trade for ₿, because you need newly minted coins or as a loss making hobby.
You need millions of dollars to become profitable in mining and it is no longer just earned by switching on a few asic machines I'm afraid. 
This may change over the next month but I doubt it.

The fact he is a fake and used some clever misdirection to fool the media, it's not surprising someone with those skills can pull the wool over the eyes of technical people who see a valid signature work and potentially walked through a successful private signing done on a custom modified electrum wallet to look authentic.
It's one heck of a lot of work to perform this elaborate fake, but ultimately the maths and logs don't lie... Craig is not Satoshi because his proof is simply wrong.

I think if every person on the planet had a billion addresses each for a billion years it'd be
Say 2^128 addresses (it's probably more but whatever)
Chances are 1 in   (2^128) / billion addresses per person / 16 billion people / billion years
1 billion is about 2^30 
16 billion is about 2^34 
so we're talking
= 2^(128 - 30 - 34 - 30) = 1 in 2^34 = 1 in 8,589,934,592 of a clash happening.
So to summarize 1 billion addresses for each person for 16 billion people done over a billion years will give you a chance of 1 in 8.5 billion chance the address may have been used before... 
i.e. it ain't gonna happen assuming the number is random... these numbers are just simply waaaaaay bigger than anything we're used to in ordinary life.

Not sure I follow?  Cash deposit should only be done when you've got an escrowed bitcoin payment pending to you.  That mitigates most of the risk for both the buyer and the seller.
Bitcoin for the buyer shouldn't be risky, either it happens or it doesn't.  The seller can't take it back and if done via escrow again the seller has protection too.

Do you mean adopt or adapt?  
I can't see any country officially adopting bitcoin but who knows... Greece citizens may start using it if they exit the euro and create their own defunct fiat but it would never be official in our lifetime.. just too much risk for a country to adopt something that is less than a decade old.
Perhaps if bitcoin stands up to a few decades of safe usage it may happen but my hunch is bitcoin is better as a long term store of value or global value transfer mechanism rather than a currency in it's own right.

If you're nervous about volatility buy at set regular intervals.  The more frequent and longer period of time eliminates the volatility risk at the expense of usually paying slightly higher fees from the exchange.
The margin between buy/sell is very minimal otherwise people would do arbitrage between the various exchanges (and do hence why it's small).  I expect you'd typically see 0.5% in the buy/sell price difference on the same exchange since this is the price of the exchange's fees.
Is it a good time to invest?  In the short term, who knows, you'll certainly get more bitcoin today than you would have yesterday.  
In the long run you have to consider do you think bitcoin has reached it's full potential or can you see it being used by more in time?  If you can see more opportunities of a global currency than it's currently being used for you can be pretty confident it will become more valuable over time.
If you're unsure don't invest.  If you've read up and believe it has more potential now is a great time to be getting in since people are freaking out about a non-event coming up.

2000 \^ number of words.  
So with 4 words they need to do at most
guesses.  
Statistically they probably only need to do half that so 8,000,000,000,000.  If 1 computer was used and say it could do 1,000 per second (Tall order but go with it), that's 8000000000 seconds = 250 years.
They could use 250 computers on it, which costs around $2000/month to run so that would be in the region of $12,000 to crack it.
Very super high level figures but yes 4 words is feasible to crack.  5 probably only just possible if you have a shed load of money/time/computing power.  6 words.. pretty darn safe with today's machines.
There is one omission, I believe there is a checksum in there which could save say 1000x speed up, 6 words however is fairly safe and 7 words should be safe with today's tech.

In a nutshell, bitcoin is the first finite resource on the internet an individual can own. It isn't controlled by any person/group/company, it is just a set of rules to describe interacting with the shared ledger (the blockchain).  Anyone can code a wallet to interact with the bitcoin network but most just use wallets that already exist such as electrum, bread, mycelium, copay, etc...
These rules allow anyone who can answer the quiz locking a balance is able to send them to a new location.  The quiz is set by the receiver and is usually 'what is the password locking this address?' to spend them.  
This is why wallets just store the passwords (well private keys) that allow you access to spend your balances at the addresses you've created, there are no 'coins' as such though, think of it as a giant excel spreadsheet where one column is the 'address' and the column next to it is the balance available to spend from that address.
Probably worth googling, but here's a good starting spot... 
And for more details

Bitcoin is a finite supply resource, transfers can not increase the total number in circulation.
Fractional reserve banking does however.
I.e. you put $100 in an account, the bank lends out $90 of your money but tells you you still have $100 there when in truth you actually only have $10 available to you and $90 if the bank can recover the loan or take it from someone else's deposit like any other ponzi scheme.  The bank however now has $190 worth of assets... clearly it doesn't and this is the dangerous part about fractional banking that isn't common knowledge.

I don't think it's any sort of conspiracy, merely some unknown group behaviour going on or a wealthy entity has got an interesting angle on stabilising the exchange price... either force is fascinating to try and understand.
This isn't imagination, you can look at the historical trade volumes by time to see those large buy/sell spikes happening.
It could well just be bots tricking other bots but I'd have expected the average price to have moved over a period of a week even with this game going on.

So the txid is a hash of all the bytes in a transaction... Or if you create a transaction it will create a specific unique hash.
When signing a transaction however a random value is used which produces the effect that each transaction you make produces a different txid. This would make it easy as a wallet provider to follow that txid to see when your transaction is included in a block.
This is all great and works well(ish).
As I understand it there is a gotcha.  The signature of a transaction is given as two numbers (r,s). Unfortunately another perfectly valid signature is (r,-s).  This means whilst an attacker can't(edit predictive sex mistake)  resign or modify the actual transaction, they can copy/paste it and modify s to be -s.  When you hash this transaction you'll now get a different value, ie a different txid.
This screws up wallets that don't account for this.
There is probably ore to this but that's my understanding.  In expect it's tricky to solve because both Bitcoin protocol and wallets need to be updated. Bitcoin protocol can help prevent s being -s by preventing relaying -s transactions. This isn't enough however as a malicious or old miner may still accept -s in a block.  Wallets therefore just need to realise -s produces another valid txid to follow.
There's probably far more to it but that's my understanding of the issue... Is its an annoyance but generally not serious as transactions still work.

To be fair he did have 2FA enabled and this is what the scam was.  
Took him to a fake website, he entered his details, the hacker did the same on coinbase triggering the SMS to his phone.  He types in his SMS to the hackers website and probably got some error message or redirected to the real coinbase site... meanwhile the hackers are in his account and transfer the funds out.
Coinbase could prevent this by having a unique image or logo displayed based on the IP address logging in, having another SMS sent to the users phone when significant funds are transferred out of the wallet and perhaps do some heuristics on how the password is typed in to see it matches the user.

Volatility is only applicable to those speculating and holding onto coins.  Normal bitcoin usage is convert local currency-&gt;bitcoin, do your transaction, person or company converts their bitcoin back to their local currency.
That last step can be almost instant if you use a service like BitPay and the likes so volatility is virtually 0 and they have reduced overheads from paying credit card companies.
In time people may keep some of the bitcoin themselves to pay for services later thereby eliminating bank and credit card fees entirely.
It's one of the reasons why so many people get excited about it's future use.

Mining is not worth it, especially if you're new to it.  You'll need to put large sums of money in to get a return worth talking about.  ($100k+).  Unless you've got access to very cheap electricity (like hydro or solar) it's not worth doing.
Buying bitcoin from an exchange or localbitcoins is the best bet.  Bitstamp is a good place to start.

* It allows the network to scale up to have more transactions per second, something that will be needed unless side chains prove to work reliably and securely.
* Bitcoin didn't used to have this upper limit originally, it was only added in to prevent spamming... these days it's less of an issue as bitcoin's price is significantly higher and we have transaction fees.
* It will likely cause a hard blockchain fork once a large enough block is encountered, especially if changed too soon to that first larger than 1Mb block appearing.
* There is a slim risk it may break something
* The transaction fees currently reflect a supply/demand ecosystem, increasing the supply of space will allow cheaper transactions.  This can be good and bad.
I would like to see pruning to work in an alt chain like litecoin before this change is made to bitcoin.  If this is proven to work well having any sized block should be viable as long as there is some nominal fee or other technique to prevent spamming.

Only by asking a large random sample of people globally if they own any and extrapolating that % to the global population.
I'm not aware of any way to do this via blockchain analysis simply because multiple addresses can be owned by a single person.
You also have bitcoin banks where they hold coins on behalf of their clients, these will not be observable on the blockchain as distinct transactions.
You can however search the blockchain to find all unspent output transactions and this would put an upper limit on how many could own bitcoin (rather than it being in a bitcoin bank).
One bizarre fact many ignore, we also need to realize many addresses may not actually even be owned by a person, it may be a computer that actually owns the money.

I would have thought localbitcoin or similar services would be fine.  You can buy with PayPal or bank transfer in most countries or simply ask your parents to open an exchange account.
Absolute worse case scenario if you're in a country where this is for some reason not possible, you could buy the mining gear to get hold of some crypto coins (probably mining an alt coin like Ethereum, litecoin, dash, etc) and exchanging that for bitcoin.
Finally you could just buy from a friend who you trust I expect.

Whilst I don't share the view the USD/BTC price hike is going to be astounding just yet, I do agree with this line.  Not for China as they are a powerhouse but imagine a couple small countries slowing and quietly buying BTC.  A year or two later they insist it's local currency can be traded at a set BTC/currency value given their accrued reserves they've been purchasing.  
Now here's the trick, they state that to do international trade ONLY bitcoin is accepted as the foreign exchange currency.  If they remain strong and not accept another fiat this would have an absurd effect of halting any hyperinflation of their currency and skyrocketing the value of their share of the global asset.  That small country goes from insignificant to a powerhouse incredibly quickly and the other countries are left to gradually realise how much value paper money is to the internet connected world.  A win/win for the small country and a significant wealth adjustment for those countries not realising this could happen now we have invented a finite global digital asset.
Not sure if this is a good or bad thing, just seems a likely outcome of the experiment at the moment.

Purchasing coins is harder now than it was as individuals or small companies didn't need to worry about regulation rules as most people hadn't heard of bitcoin.
The companies need to do it right hence the consolidation of older ones and dip in the number of exchanges during this transition.
There is also a reluctance to buy coins until a reason to use them pops up.  Remittance seems the most likely candidate to start this but who knows, it may be property, id, crowd funded loans, etc..  any one of those may be the catalyst but history seems to indicate it'll surprise us all.  The price has shown it can easily go above $300 when a reason exists so is just a waiting phase until someone finds it and makes a fortune for the next boom/bust cycle...

Evolution theory.... Try to identify weaknesses in Bitcoin protocol, see which ones are serious (i.e. may significantly hinder mainstream adoption), see if they can be fixed in Bitcoin's protocol, if they can't be fixed and a currency comes out that addresses the weakness(s) it might be worth backing it.
Right now I'm not aware of any weakness in bitcoin that needs fixing that is seen as unfixable.  
Worst case scenario is a hard fork that may or maynot tarnish it enough for a rival currency to overtake but it would have to be a deep hard fork with an incredibly well supported side chain for that to happen.
Right now Namecoin, NXT and Peercoin seem worthy candidates to grow alongside Bitcoin... I don't see why any would surpass Bitcoin for store of value though.
If sidechains work well it'll almost seal the deal that Bitcoin is the gold that everything else is pegged from and we'll see an explosion of cryptocurrency development appear.

The lottery analogy for mining is the best one I've heard.
Mining is merely a way to ensure the system is randomly selecting 1 person from anywhere on the network every 10 minutes (on average) to verify the ledger.  By this person being truely random they have no incentive to corrupt the ledger for personal gain as the next person to check the ledger would see they did something incorrect and simply ignore their block thereby the corrupt miner doesn't get his new bitcoins.
It's a beautiful re-enforcing system.
To pick that person at random the maths problem is set such that it will take approximately 10 minutes to find the solution.  If the solutions over a two week period are being found faster or slower than 10 minutes the problem is made harder or easier such that only 1 person will find the solution every 10 minutes on average.
Because the 25BTC reward equates to $5000 every 10 minutes there's an incentive to get as many hashes as possible to increase your chance of finding that reward.   You can keep scaling up until your costs (setup, maintenance, electricity bills) are too expensive for the reward * exchange rate which is where we're at now.
If the exchange price drops, or the rewards halve (like next year) people will be forced to turn off their mining machines or run them at a loss which would be daft.
TLDR:  It's pure economics why so much computing power is securing the network.

Uasf is the most non bitcoin thing I've heard to date, why? Because it circumvents the key security feature in Bitcoin, pow of longest chain, with social engineering.
Won't be long before people start getting convinced to change hashing algorithm because of Jihan or some hacking rubbish.  
I know this will be down voted by passionate people wanting segwit just as I do, but there is certainly social manipulation going on in this subreddit 
My view is evolution of currency is far safer, if you  want segwit buy Ltc or whatever currency supports the features you want(disclaimer I do own Ltc now because of precisely this view but there are other coins that support it too). 
If enough people do that bitcoins price drops until any malicious miners go bankrupt and would now allow the feature to be added allowing the valuation to skyrocket sgain.  It's part of the robust positive feedback design.
This uasf is the intelligent design approach and v dangerous in my opinion.
The upside is the confusion is likely to drop ₿ value faster and may force the hand if segwit being adopted faster but you know the hashing argument is just around the corner as an inevitable split starts.
I'm not trying to prevent uasf, social engineering is a key hurdle the experiment needs to understand for future... Just calling out it is clearly orchestrated.

Security risks are mainly 3 things
* When a bitcoin transaction is signed it uses the private key * random number.  If that random number is reused or deterministic it's possible to take the two signatures and derive the original private key used by both.  Usually the random number is random hence is secure BUT you're trusting your wallet author to have not screwed this up.  The fact that Sony and blockchain.info both screwed this up shows it's an easy mistake to make.
* When you spend from an address, only at this point that the spend is broadcast on the bitcoin network is your public key made known to the world.  Before this it exists only as a hash so virtually impossible to derive the public key from it.  If in future ECDSA becomes compromised (perhaps by a powerful enough Quantum Computer) it is feasible someone could do the public key-&gt;private key conversion and therefore spend your funds.  It's likely this public key-&gt;private key process will take much much longer than 10 mins so isn't even a risk to bitcoin network generally but would be a risk to any address that has had funds spent from it but still has funds remaining there.
* Privacy.  If you spend from an address it's definitive proof from that person you spent to that you also made the other payments.  Normally nothing to worry about but you may prefer not broadcasting to the world everything you do in the immutable ledger.

Firstly I'm actually happy to open my wifi up to anyone and everyone and not charge for it, all I want is a way to irrefutably prove who was logged on to my internet connection and they know they will be responsible for all connections they make.  I don't want to necessarily browse their history, I merely want to ensure they know they'll be responsible for their internet connection and should there be an issue people know to contact them directly and not involve me.

Are you sure these have actually been stolen and isn't just your wallet hasn't picked up a change address correctly?  
The fact it goes from one multisig address to another is somewhat suspicious... I'd be surprised a hacker would use a multisig address to receive the funds on because... well what's the advantage for the hassle of doing it for an individual?  
If it's because they're using a 3rd party service you'd think this would be a bad idea for the hacker to do given they'll likely leak some sensitive information to that service and/or may have their funds hindered or IPs tracked when flagged as stolen.  
It could be that the hacker is using their own multisig wallet system I guess, yes it is possible but just seems rather weird unless many people are involved.
This is why I'd start with the innocent logic error at first and perhaps a rescan will do the trick.  
Which wallet is running your multisig tech?  Is it proprietary or an open source bit of tech?  
If that doesn't help, perhaps doing an internal audit just in case?

Since it looks like you've sent the funds already I'd like to believe this was merely a receiving address you copy/pasted and that address has now changed when you view the page again.  (Many programs will try to use a unique receiving address per payment so you know who made the payment and for what order).
Does that help?

Bitcoin isn't ready to be used by the coffee shops at this low level.  It works but if millions jump on it now the limited space would make the fees too high to be feasible for small value items.  I.e. bitcoin is mainly a settlement layer at that sort of scale and for high value transfer when many are involved.
LN seems a very ambitious approach to allow for coffee shop purchases... guess we will have to wait and see what adoption is like when it becomes standardised.  It seems fraught with complications which makes me think it will take a long time for consumer adoption to happen but it has the potential to do this.
Sidechains/Treechains are another scalable approach being worked on.  This is probably going to allow for a lot of innovation and adaptation in bitcoin and just how today's low level internet is nothing like it was 30 years ago even though we still call it the same thing, the same is likely for bitcoin via sidechain innovation.  One of those innovations may enable vast micropayments to be feasible.
Centralised payment hubs are the most likely vastly scalable solution as it's really easy.  Only when one payment hub needs to settle with another is the blockchain touched hence fees can be super low and even work with existing debit card systems.  Plutus.it is a great example of this but expect many more to pop up if this succeeds.
Time will tell...

Amazing start, can't wait for segwit/malleability fix/hardening so this can be used in our production env.
Anyone else find it incredible how the bitcoin naysayers expected tps to go from 4 to 8 to 16 year on year, yet it's now set to exceed 100,000 in less than a year AND with small blocks.  Added the 10 min confirmation times now become instant... This blows the financial tools like paypal and visa out of the water on transactions capabilities.

I was a sceptical it would work at first,  I did my own research, made my own conclusions and from that believe in the technology enabling more in future.
Yes there is a risk it could become worthless, but every day it is exchanged for local value somewhere in the world it looks ever stronger.

Name calling doesn't help anyone, it just makes you enemies for no real purpose.  Being reasonable you should know a technology stands up on it's own merit and back whatever you believe in.  I.e. if Ethereum were technically better suited to transfer and store of value bitcoin, no amount of name calling would change that fact.  If anything it's endorsing others to buy that coin because you're sounding scared that it's going to potentially eclipse bitcoin.
IMHO bitcoin is still vastly better for transferring and storing value for many reasons so I'm happy if anyone says ethereum is bitcoin v2 because I know they're simply wrong.  Heck it even states how ether is not a sensible investment opportunity on their website!
What I will say though is that Ethereum pinoneering and charting new territories with autonomous contracts.   I for one am much happier these experiments are not done in bitcoin's name since this is inevitably a huge mine field and most likely a PR disaster waiting to happen once some megalomaniac realises what it enables.
If Ethereum does find a niche for the technology that makes it a no-brainer for others to use, I'm sure it will appear in bitcoin (as a sidechain or layer on top) too but also take with it the learnings Ethereum are working hard to discover and resolve.
Don't get me wrong, Ethereum may start taking the attention away from bitcoin but in it's current form it's like comparing a boat and a train and saying only one form of transport can exist when really they aren't competing.

I'd suggest start simple.  Learning a language is a means to an end for what you're after.
If you want to make things with bitcoin focus on a new language like Javascript.  It's the most widespread language and is very similar to C++ (except without the pointers which is the part most people get stuck on).
If you want to do more server side things, you can use a node.js based server which runs with javascript.  For mobile apps and websites, again javascript is the easiest starting option.
If you need to get a bit more into the crypto side of things, python is a easier to use for this because it handles vast numbers easily with a few libraries.  I've seen Python is typically used by build engineers and simulation modelling too so is a good corporate wide skill.  If you know JS it probably only takes a day or two to learn Python's basics.
If you want to write high speed applications you're talking the C++/C/Java/ObjectiveC side.  After spending 15 years of my life with C/C++ and touching on Java and circle jerking that javascript was a joke due to it's lack of memory management and performance, I'm now 100% converted over to javascript because you can 'stand on the shoulders of giants' as they say and allows me to do in about 2 lines of code something that would have taken me a several hundred in C/C++.  My former self would have argued that this is true with C libraries too, but the problem is there is no trusted C library resource center AND you generally get compiled code to link in making it a black box you're unable to debug which also causes problems with platform configurations/OS/system architecture/updates.  
The power these days is more often than not knowing the efficient algorithms to use and having them to hand.  It used to be about speed and performance but to give you an example... If you wanted to solve something that was time critical it used to be a case of counting the clock cycles on the fastest HW you'd have available to solve it, not fast enough?  Do more optimization on the code and repeat.  These days that approach is usually rather stupid, instead you find an equivalent scalable algorithm that can be deployed on X machines.  If the result is too slow, buy more machines until the result is fast enough.  Machines cost hardly anything compared to wages and in a highly connected world.  
To do this scalable approach in C/C++ takes *a long* time to get right, bitcoin is a testament to it can be done right and still has it's place but this is in the deep end of programming.  
Don't get me wrong, C/C++ is still a very useful language, just saying it's you have a selection now and unless your employer is asking for a specific language, why not start with the easy one to get your goal done.

Which app are you using?
My guess is that you've got this address here (1LVKiCMkuejAGpegk5GMHXQjcYfYcpfRMc) that received 0.1 BTC and tried to spend it before it was included in a block.  Whilst normally fine, the complication here is that this deposit was done with a transaction that suffered from the transaction malleability issue.  
I.e that crediting transaction (lets' call it TX A) was signed with a "high S" value (50% chance if your wallet hasn't been updated to 0.11 rules) so the transaction was sent around the bitcoin network and modified/resigned to have a low S value and rebroadcast by someone else which would changes the transaction ID (let's call this TX B).  The transfer of 0.1BTC still worked perfectly fine but your wallet is now confused!
Next you have a transaction trying to spend those funds (TX spend) using transaction TX (A) but it can't since TX A was rejected by the network as TX B which was successfully included in block 380650.
The solution is probably just to wait it out on your wallet to sync and resend the transaction.  This isn't normal operation but merely because of the v0.11 new relay rule to prevent high S's in signatures, someone trying to help by resigning your transaction so it can be included in a block, and your wallet not understanding what the heck happened... in time this new rule change will prevent this sort of attack happening so is a necessary transition pain.  
Unfortunately we have to wait until the wallets are updated with this new rule to prevent the inconvenience it causes but makes Bitcoin more robust in the long run.
For precise details here are the ID's of the transactions I can see.
TX A = 6649f7fe1584e2cef57d8a4a7c98abbf04e4276cf2a437e0dfad3b342e72a8bc
TX B = a397610e2d39fff414166a3d70e59fe9e75d5d7e2ae75d30d2dc810c021d8156
TX spend = c986a4e611f6b38286e94af6af3934ad0e17f440d7db53199e2ad67902049856 (Invalid as the inputs are based on TX A not TX B)

Ethereum as a protocol is still solid, that wasn't hacked at all... it was merely one of their R&amp;D contracts that had a serious flaw in it and those funds were moved in a way not intended (Something to be said about eggs in one basket).  
Having ethereum contracts running on bitcoin seems an incredibly powerful combination because bitcoin has a far more stable store of value than Ether.
IMHO ethereum would do well becoming a sidechain rather than trying to go head to head with bitcoin, why reinvent the wheel?  Ethereum still needs to overcome the stable price valuation and scalability issues that bitcoin is already solving.

I'd be shocked if bitcoin was processing $35B/year.... that would simply be astonishing.
To compare the two in value by transaction volume appears misguided.  
Remember Paypal doesn't own or create USD.  Paypal's value is in the ability to transfer the funds and profits from taking a slice of everyone's transactions to create it's valuation for shareholders.  
Bitcoin's approach however is not by taking value on each transaction but by the limited asset that is being traded with each other.
The two are totally different things IMHO.  Just so happens bitcoin can also easily do transfers like paypal does... but volume of transactions are fairly irrelevant to bitcoin's market cap calculation.
Paypal for instance doesn't enable inventions like autonomous agents, DACs, sharetrading, single truth ledgers and other items that the internet has been screaming out for.
I believe in absence of an even more revolutionary invention, saying $400 to control 1/21,000,000th of the entire global resource is probably laughable to future generations if it still existed.  Who knows though, it is only an experiment and something may usurp it.

Yes, I would expect you can safely ignore it.

Just like a vehicle each person has different requirements for their wallet.
If you are merely wanting to store and spend funds on your PC or your mobile that autofwd link is a great place to start.  If you want to have access to those same funds on multiple devices you will probably need a different solution since bread, mycelium are only mobile apps and electrum is only mac/pc.
 is available on iOS and PC/Mac website.
These guys have a more advanced wallet (the UI isn't as easy as breadwallet since they don't have fingerprint scanning and is somewhat cluttered with the various options as it covers so much).
The massive advantage of greenaddress wallet is that it is multisig so should be vastly more secure than average wallets since greenaddress counter sign transactions for you (they don't have access to spend your funds though).  They also work with Trezor if you are talking large sums of money.
Should greenaddress cease to exist you will be able to transfer the funds to another account 90 days later due to some clever locked transaction magic they've done.
My main issue with greenaddrees is you can only be logged in on one device at a time... for some this is a good security feature.  For me it's a little limiting in a corporate environment and perhaps it's merely an option.
If you're talking a POS system take a look in as there was a recent post about POS systems there.

If you have the private key you can access the funds.
Type in the private key into something like [coinb.in]( 
Click New-&gt;transaction
Enter the private key.
Load the inputs to find the balances.
You should now see the funds are available to spend.
Select advanced and tick 'RBF' so you can issue another tx should you mess up.
Select "inputs"
Tick the input you want to use.
Enter the MAINNET address you want to send the funds to
Enter the amount to send (basically the full amount minus the tx fee you want to pay)
Sign the transaction.  
You can now ask people to verify this transaction is correct by sharing the signed transaction here if you want.
Check and double check the mining fee is sensible, check the destination address of the signed tx is where you want the funds to go... when you've done your triple checks and happy you can now publish the transaction and your funds will appear at that destination address.
Clearly never share your private key but you can safely share your signed transaction BEFORE you broadcast it should you want someone else to review it to make sure it's done correctly.
Best of luck!

So what ever country bans it would prevent the legal uses of it.
The illegal uses would continue ban or no ban.
The legal uses would still continue in all other countries thereby putting the banned country at a competitive disadvantage.
Bitcoin exchange price would drop dramatically if it was the US that banned it as demand would disappear, but it will inevitably bounce back after everyone has bought the cheap coins that would be dumped on the market.
They'd also likely be legal ways to purchase bitcoin within a banned country too, travel abroad, work for hire, refunds from another country, vouchers, etfs, companies that work with bitcoin, etc... 
Ultimately if you know the private key number you can spend the value from any computer anywhere in the world so it's therefore impossible to enforce legislation that memorizing a number will put you in jail.
I think bitcoin would have been banned already if it was possible too, look at e-cash, QQ, linden dollars, etc..
Worst case scenario, worldwide it was banned somehow, another digital currency would just pop up that could exist in the framework of the law.  Take a look at Namecoin, banning something like this would be nuts but those tokens have value by the fact there is scarcity of them.  That value is fairly low as demand is low, however their utility value is very high in comparison to bitcoin.  These and others like it are likely to skyrocket if bitcoin were to be banned.
Guess the main point is, the genie is out of the bottle so need to figure out how to best utilize it.

'Some miners could opt to ignore the BIP148 rule and attempt to split the chain, but this would require a majority of miners who would be out of consensus from the rest of the economic majority.'
This is my point, uasf worked in the past because it was not contentious by the miners, segwit is and by the sounds of it because asicboost is being used.
Until bitmain starts signaling this is the blocker unless ive misunderstood something here. 
Bitstamp/kraken/bittylicious/coinbase etc are opening themselves up to a massive attack vector if bitmain (pr i should say their pools) are malicious and decide to attack the weaker chain for personal gain?
Id love to be wrong about it and hope it works but im sceptical from what i know of it so far.
Either bitmain adopts it or people start using a better alt that does support segwit (thereby devaluing bitcoin or appreciating another) are the outcomes i can believe to work.

Greece doesn't want out of the euro but it's citizens don't want to be stuck with a debt they'll never be able to repay.  Their gov is in a difficult position where they are unable to do QE to get themselves out of it but they want to do something about the ridiculous interest payments they need to make that is crippling any chance of recovery.
I'm not suggesting Greece would ever adopt bitcoin, I'm suggesting that should Greece exit the euro and start it's own currency it's citizens will be clambering to find ways to avoid losing their wealth. 
Most will try to invest in the traditional overseas properties, stocks/shares and precious metals, foreign bonds before any transition but the gov will have to clamp down on this almost immediately to prevent a deeper mess (as history has shown this preventative action needs to happen).  
Those technically minded however may also consider bitcoin given no 3rd party is needed so can't be stopped by blocking bank transfers and the likes.
Right now it's too volatile for people to consider doing this as long term storage but if your local currency is about to become cat litter it sounds a pretty good alternative at least as a transition to a more stable currency/commodity.

Given M1 includes checking accounts from fractionally reserved commercial banks it makes the whole thing a farce to evaluate it's real value.  If 1 trillion euros is being pumped into these commercial banks as cash, looking at this  it appears they only need to hold between 0% and 1% as reserves?  By that logic this 1 trillion would equate to 100 trillion after it's gone through the fractional system... I can't believe this to be correct though as there is only 5.9 trillion euro in M1 at the moment.  Would love someone to set me on the straight and narrow of what this all really means.

No change in the supply but would have other indirect impacts...
* Satoshi would have earned less coins (he/she/they/it still hasn't touched their coins btw)
* Satoshi would have most likely swapped SHA256(SHA256(x)) mining since he wasn't earning any and would have assumed SHA256 was compromised to achieve that hash rate since no one should be able to mine that quickly without millions on PCs mining yet the node count would still be only a handful.
* If he had continued with SHA256 approach it would have made others less likely to get involved since mining since the difficulty would have rocketed.  Your ASIC would be grabbing nearly all of the coins available each month, remember this is before GPUs or even FPGAs were used so you're ASIC is equivalent to 10,000,000 high end PCs mining.

Not sure why this is upvoted so much... many of those top 50 companies are already very aware of Bitcoin, researching it and may even have tech in place to use it if they decide to...
Microsoft, Google, Apple, JP Morgan, IBM have certainly done their homework and understand it... heck Microsoft is leading the way and already actually accepting it (even if they're only using it as a payment system).
Walmart, Amazon, Target will be more than aware their small competitors are already aggressively going for market leading role and it's in all their interest for it to eventually go mainstream to reduce their fees and fraud.
Citigroup, Boeing, United Technologies will save a fortune on B2B/intercontinental transfers alone as bitcoin's exchange price becomes more stable and exchanges become more established.
Any of these companies CTOs should rightfully be getting a lot of heat if they didn't already have research/analysis plans in place to determine when bitcoin would become appropriate to use in their organization and what would be needed to make the integrations.

I'm sure they could but not sure it would get anywhere unless it was a really large sum of cash.
Cash deposit is a trusting exchange where you know the other person, using cash for in person exchange makes sense however as it's instant and you physically are next to each other which lowers risk.  Using bank deposit where you can get a chargeback is sensible for the buyer if done remotely without escrow, most sellers will be nervous about this without reputation due to that chargeback risk.
Cash bank deposit sounds like it should only ever be considered when a bitcoin escrow service is used... just like you'd never want to do a cash deposit to a bank to purchase a car on ebay.

The chance you have a virus that modifies your RNG or private keys generated is much less than the chance the site you generated the paper wallet keys on is compromised... that said, both are incredibly remote chances and paper wallets are most likely secure.
For total security though, use a hardware wallet like Trezor... it's a no brainer and vastly easier to use than a paper wallet.
The main issue with paper wallets is that when you go to redeem them you have to sweep all the funds and create a new paper wallet to be safe.  I.e. it's a pain in the ass.
Using an HD wallet like MyCelium or Copay and write down those backup seeds is just as safe as a paper wallet and far easier to use.  You can now delete the wallet and restore it to regain access to your funds at anytime in the future.

I essentially want my own node so I can trust it isn't going to go out of business... I could do this with a number of 3rd party services like blockchain.info/blockr.io/etc... in a few hours but the point is I want to use bitcoin directly and not need to trust some service will still be around next year.
All I want is to integrate my node.js API with bitcoind such that I can accept payments to a unique address (ideally HD generated) for each purchase, get notified when funds were deposited, forward the funds to cold storage automatically and ideally have a websocket callback when it completes.
Bitcore seems to offer this (at least from looking at their docs) but I've found it incredibly difficult to actually get this to happen and had to purchase a new machine just to sync the blockchain.

Satoshi seems a far smarter person than I am and even seems to have taken steps to remain anonymous, if he wanted to trade that many coins in he'd almost certainly do it via a private sale instead of an exchange where they have to practice KYC.
I'd like to believe in the years to come Satoshi may well start using some of his coins and perhaps be a philanthropist supporting projects to make society better...

* age of coins being moved (older coins have higher priority)
* amount being transferred
* size in bytes of the transaction
A transaction can be included in a block at anytime since adding a new transaction to a proposed block merely changes the hash value it generates it just like incrementing the nonce counter does... i.e. it's not like it has to start at the beginning or anything like that.
@_date: 2016-07-20 12:29:36
Blocks contain many transactions.
Each block also contains a hash of the previous block it builds on.
A block is made by miners.  They gather all the pending transactions, include a new transaction that creates some new bitcoin to themselves (at the moment they can create themselves up to 12.5BTC + any fees given in transactions they gather).  These transactions, their bitcoin creating transaction, the previous block hash number, timestamp number and a nonce are all gathered up as 'the block'.  The nonce is just a fancy word for a counter that the miner starts at 0 and goes up one at a time.  Each time they increment the nonce or add a new transaction to the proposed block the resulting hash changes.  
Let's call this resulting hash number H.  If H is less a threshold the bitcoin network is working towards it is considered an approved block so the miner publishes it to everyone, the miner gets their 12.5 bitcoin reward of new coins and the process starts again.

It has merit, especially when travelling but the issues that needs to get resolved first are not really about payments but instead about trust and accountability...
1) I want to know what they're doing with my connection isn't going to land me in trouble.  If some guy ran a SR website via my connection I'm the one going to court and I want certainty I can prove it was them that used the connection and not myself.  So to solve this I need irrefutable legally binding proof that person A was using my connection at time B.  
2) As a user of someone else's system I want to know my connection is absolutely secure and whoever I've connected to has no way to packet sniff my bits.
3) I want notifications and visibility of who's connected and how much bandwidth they're using with the possibility of throttling it should I need the bandwidth.
Once those 3 items are addressed, now I may be interested in making and taking payments for sharing my wifi.
That said, I'd also be more keen on doing wifi-&gt;wifi connections before accepting payments too, that would now allow the dependency of ISPs to be removed from the equation... 
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:43:48
Was more referring to the fact that you can be pretty certain they have the coins and are going to transfer them without legal complications or the risk they do a runner with the cash and coins mid transaction.

The base Unit of bitcoin has now equalled parity of the base unit of other currencies from a technical perspective this is an interesting development.  It lends bitcoin to be ever closer to being a digital settlement layer, i.e. modern gold.

Just to add to this, remember a bitcoin wallet just holds the passwords to spend your funds on the global bitcoin blockchain.  
Make sure you pick an HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet for storing your own funds.  
These wallets will give you 13 words to write down and keep safe.  
With just those 13 words you can recreate your wallet on any computer/mobile device and get your funds back ready to spend... i.e. you could memorise them but definitely write them down anyhow!
A few HD wallets in alphabetical order are
* Bread (iOS)
* CoPay (iOS/Android)
* Electrum ( PC/Mac )
* MyCelium (iOS/Android)
As drehb says, a Trezor hardware HD wallet is definitely worth it if you're storing a lot of money.

Before people scare you off, to mine you just need to purchase a SHA256 based ASIC from ebay.  There are plenty around and you want at least 60Gh to make even a few cents per day.
Firstly you'll need to put this down to a learning experience to do, it is great to try it to understand how anyone can in theory join in mining BUT if you're trying to make money from it you're far better off just purchasing coins from the exchanges.  To do mining to make any significant money (like more than $1 per day) you'll need to invest in expensive HW which does at least 1THash and draws around 500-1000W of power.
Personally I'd suggest just getting a small thumb drive, get it up and running and then purchase coins from an exchange if you want to own any significant amount.

long term, quite possibly a good investment.  It'll either skyrocket or go to 0 and seems on track for skyrocket at the moment.
1,2,3 years... may fluctuate, may even go to $100 or less but eventually as more and more adoption occurs the price will correlate to it's usage value which you can see from transactions has been continually growing since it's inception.  This is the strongest sign that it's the tip of the iceberg we're seeing.

Sorry for your loss.
Did you have a password to the computer?
If not, perhaps you could send an email to yourself offering $1000 if the robber could leave the laptop for you somewhere, no questions asked.
Perhaps try gumtree/ebay to look out for your computer appearing there.  Long shot but you never know.
Also did you keep a copy of your mac address?  That may be helpful for the police as they will no doubt encounter a lot of stolen property and you may get lucky via this approach too.
This is probably too late but it's worth using it as a PSA that it may help putting something like  on your sensitive equipment.
This way at least if your computer is stolen there's a chance it will be returned.
Once again, sorry for your loss.  If you decide to start collecting again i'd highly recommend electrum or other HD wallet where you can memorise the key to retrieve your funds.

bitcoin.org is probably best bet however a few pointers while I'm here...
You need 250Gb of diskspace these days for a full node, I'd suggest at least 500Gb to be safe so you can take a backup once it fully syncs!  80Gb is a minimum for the chain and more room for log files, db index files and the rest.  You can run a pruned node to have a much smaller size but will let someone else chime in on this.
The easiest way, if you have a fast enough and capable enough computer is just to install bitcore.(   This installs node.js, their wallet software, their blockchain explorer so you can visit localhost:3002 in a browser to watch the blockchain and of course installs and runs a full bitcoind client.
If you put it on Ubuntu make sure you're running at least v16.
It takes around a week to sync the blockchain on a reasonable Intel Duo computer with 8Gb ram.
I also found their instructions to sometimes need tweaks so probably best to send any gotchas back to them to help keep the docs fresh as most people only install once and forget about it.
Good luck!

You can pick a random number as your private key with pen and paper if you'd like.  From this private key you can derive your bitcoin address to deposit funds at.  
This means you can ask people (or send the funds you own) to this bitcoin address knowing that no one in the world has the private key to spend the funds.
This is an extreme example and normally people would use bitaddress.org or similar to create a paper wallet and have an offline computer do this private key-&gt;bitcoin address calculation for you.

Because you can only increase the blocksize so far before other things become a bottleneck (such as needing Terrabytes of HD space just to store the chain, Gbps connections, faster CPUs).  I.e. this causes a dangerous situation of centralisation.
Bitcoin is not currently designed to handle microtransactions, it is designed to be very much a settlement layer.  That said, the few million people using it right now means the system easily copes so it is possible to do microtransactions and this is why it's a blurry line.
If bitcoin suddenly had 100x or 1000x adoption rate in a year those microtransactions would be unpractical even with unlimited blocksizes and without a clear vision on how bitcoin can cope would make the other currency a stronger candidate for a global currency.
Keeping to moderate 1Mb blocksizes makes innovation happens faster to allow for layer2 development like lightning network, sidechains and other innovation that actually solve vast scalability and will easily handle the 1000x adoption rate with bitcoin.

Make sure you check the electrum sha256/md5.
Personally I love [bitaddress.org](  to generate the paper wallets although this is for really really cold storage stuff.  Again you have to trust their code like you're trusting electrum code.  You can run the paper wallet code offline, verify the zip hash is the same as what has been verified on the site.  
That said it's old school, doing it with an HD wallet like you say with electrum is safer later when wanting to spend the funds although you still need to enter your master seed again at that point which is a security risk.  Your approach should be fine as long as you verify the zip/exe used.    \*\*Do not run it on a windows PC if you can avoid it\*\*, you can almost guarantee it is compromised if it ever touched or touches the internet.  Windows is a malware magnet and it is fundamentally not built for the internet and security. 
( I mean how the heck in 2019 can we still have people visit a website and it silently compromise their entire machine??  Yes the latest version is much better but I still had my last windows PC compromised within a month of normal web browsing via DNS poisoning.  Uninstalled and never touching windows again after that terrifying experience, pleasantly surprised how painless it was to ditch for things like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc...  And yes you get Word,Excel,paint,outlook compatible programs all for free and nearly all modern tech has ubuntu equivalent)
If this is for more than $500 though buy a hardware wallet... don't mess around with this stuff.  Yes paper wallets are incredibly secure if you know what you're doing but why risk the things you can't know about.  Feel free to do it if you want,  just saying there are much much easier ways now with less risk.  
If you get a Trezor or Ledger you can use it as a password manager too and makes it far easier to sleep at night.

It's safe to receive multiple transactions to the same address but it can become tricky tracking if you want to know if someone has paid you or not by reusing the same address.  For sales it's best to use one address per purchase if you can.
For transferring funds out and the address you send the change back to, if you reuse the address at this point the public key to that address is now known to everyone.  Whilst we currently don't have a way to go from public key-&gt;private key so still considered secure, with quantum computing it's theoretically possible to calculate this.
That means re-using an address to receive your change is considered bad practice should the private/public key cryptography ever become compromised.

So all a wallet does is hold private keys (basically incredibly large numbers).
From this large number you can derive a matching number called a public key which gives the address it represents.  It is NOT possible to do the reverse, ie take an address or piblic key and derive the private key number.
Now signing is a trick to prove you know the private key number associated to an address but without revealing it.
When you spend funds for example you say ‘I want to send funds from this address to another address’.  The thing is anyone could say that as addresses are public.
So you could send that same message but also include your private key number.  Now the problem with that is others will now know the private key number so those malicious people could simply write a new transaction to send the funds to themselves using your now publicly available private key.
The solution is digital signatures.  These take the message, eg ‘I want to send from A to B’ and turn it into a single number via a mechanism called hashing.   Lets call the number ‘M’
Now we can do this trick to take M and encode it with the private key to give the number S.
The clever bit is S includes random numbers too so changes every time we do this step.
Now the recipient can take your public key number and decode S. This should return S to the number M therefore proving you had to have the private key but never exposed it.
You can also sign a custom message like ‘hello world’ with your private key to show you know the private key associated to the address but again safely without risking your funds.  This can be helpful to prove you own funds or you are the identity associated to an address given only the owner could sign such a message.
So in a nut shell, yes it is generally safe to sign a message and prove ownership of an address using well known wallets like bitcoind and electrum.  
I say generally because if signing is done incorrectly and not picking random values to use to sign with it is possible to derive the private key from two weak signatures of a flawed wallet.  
The very famous example of this is the PS3 private key was discovered because Sony didnt use random numbers when signing but instead used the same value in the same signing system used by bitcoin.
*I have skipped a lot of things but should be enough detail to fully understand what signing is.

It's a simple game of each miner does a calculation... take all the bitcoin transactions it knows about and want to include in a block, adds a transaction to credit themselves with 12.5 btc + the mining fees from the transactions gathered.  Let's call that data set 'D'.
You now put a header on it called 'H'.  This header contains things like a timestamp and the nonce.
The 'nonce' value is just an arbitrary number, you start at 0 and count up.
Now the miner essentially does Hash( H + nonce + D )  to give a number X.
If X is &lt; the blockchain threshold Y it is now a valid block so the miner shares the found answer with everyone.  
Now that answer only works for that specific block of transactions including the transaction to the miner crediting themselves the 12.5btc and mining fees (Or put simply that miner gets more than $30000 in bitcoin).
So a miner might get lucky and get a valid block with a nonce of '0' or it might be after they've done 120,000,000,000,000 hashes (hence why we are in the exa-hash territory).  
Now Y is calculated such that the probability of finding the nonce is based on how long it's taken in the past.  
I.e. this is just a gigantic lottery for that single winning ticket every 10 mins.  
Now normally mining pools are used such that people smooth out their winnings and get paid for their share of hashes they've contributed to the pool.

It's sort of the point of bitcoin, you can't just block it.
Secondly, it's not bitcoin that is causing the ransomware, it's the hackers and they want something of value in return. If you somehow magically did get rid of that address or even made bitcoin worthless somehow they'd simply ask for something else.   The next suggestion people usually say is 'ban xyz' but again banning it won't prevent them from demanding that as the only payment option.
It's probably more effective to ban email so that email address can't be used... again not very effective in the long run though.

Bitcoin network is still 100% uptime even during any hardfork, if you hold the bitcoin there is absolutely nothing preventing you doing regular OTC trades.

I'm afraid this is already done/tried/failed approach.
The issue is, assuming an attack did work, it could not be replayed indefinitely and bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency.  Destroying bitcoin would mean another like ltc LN/zcash/dash/iota/monero whatever will simply replace it.  Those currencies are vastly harder to track so by killing bitcoin it makes the problem they are trying to solve even worse.  Secondly the exchanges aren't the only sources to purchase or trade bitcoin, they are merely the on/off ramps for local fiat exchange with the masses.  OTC trades can still happen and when big money is flying around like this you can make a fortune being both trader and buyer when someone dumps a fortune into the system to game it.
Generally bitcoin can be influenced short term with these sorts of tricks but it will not do any long term damage and merely stifles adoption at the tax payers loss rather than preventing it.

Last one I tried was in Old St and charged 5% I think... so about that of a LINK machine when taking out £20 but for novelty value it was far better value than any LINK machine.
I think it's a tradeoff, ATMs are instant convenient transactions we're all used to with bank ATMs but given the owners can't do fractional banking they need to charge a transparent and fair fee up front for the trade to offer the genuine service.
If it was a bank they don't really show the actual value of our deposit... e.g. deposit £1000 and the ATM should read "We guarantee to repay you up to £50, if we have the funds we will allow you to withdraw up to £400 today and £1000 in total based on your account value" 
Guess that's rather long winded so mine just says "Account balance:£1000" and I trust the bank not to become bankrupt because it's not happened before.

IMHO Blockchain and bitcoin are equivalent to metals and gold.  Could something surpass gold as the store of value?  Yes, just like Silver and other precious metals.  That said everyone recognises Gold as the base store of value in metals and the same is true with bitcoin and any other blockchain.  
That said some metals have special properties not found in gold that make them valuable for their own reason.  This doesn't usurp gold as a store of value though.

The big difference is UK doesn't use the euro,  it can't really get in trouble as it can always print more pounds if liquidity became a problem.
The ECB however is very different, as I understand it they won't easily print more money given they represent all nations in the EU.   The problem then becomes almost a classic "tragedy of the commons" issue. Why would a wealthy nation agree to help another nation at the detriment to it's own.  Whilst equal distribution of equity is the best answer for the group, it's not as beneficial to those not in trouble therefore unlikely to be voted for.

MyCelium is really good for general users of bitcoin.  It's the easiest one I normally start people on.
Jaxx is for people who want to also own Litecoin and Ethereum since it includes ShapeShift and HD support for both.  Their UI is a bit cramped IMHO (and I'm not a fan of dark UIs) but the feature set is excellent and seems well made.
Copay is excellent for developers because it allows for Testnet wallets.  I love their wallet but it's not intuitive to use with lots of steps to actually send money needed.
Bread has the best iOS interface but like I said, because of their non-standard HD seed approach it's too risky to recommend to new users.

Thank you, that is some great tips and I'll take a peek at the list since block api call as hadn't seen that one yet.
I guess the cold wallet approach is not quite accurate, it's actually I want only excess funds from the HD wallet to go to coldstorage so the HD wallet always has a small balance to spend from.

That's a lot of questions and probably worth looking at bitcoin.org for a more thorough answer but here you go...
"What determines where one block ends and the next one begins?"
  This is simply the point when the block puzzle has been solved by a miner.  At this point the block is completed and a new block is started with any new transactions (or outstanding transactions from the mem pool).
"What exactly is computed when blocks are solved?"
Transactions are appended one after another into a block and the miners hash all those transactions together into a number.  It then starts mixing this number with a 'nonce' which is essentially a counter starting at 0 going up.  All this data is hashed twice with a formula called SHA256.  It's a pretty easy formula that can even be done by hand (ok, not easy by hand but it's just bit logic).  The purpose of the hash is given the input an unrecognisable random looking output is generated.  There is no way to reverse this.  The other feature is it's reproducable, i.e. with that same set of input data run through SHA256 you'll always get the same number out.  The test is simply finding a number that is below some threshold number.  The threshold number is calculated based on how quickly previous blocks have been solved and is referred to as the blockchain difficulty level.  When a miner finds a sha256(sha256(combination of nonce and the transactions in the block)) that is less than the threshold they publish the block and everyone can verify they've found a valid solution.  
"What is the source of wallets' including Core randomness when generating new keys?"
There are a number of ways to do this and you're right that computers are rubbish are picking random numbers. The approach here is to use other entropy sources too.  Keyboard input, mouse input, etc... all help seed a more random starting number.  Take a look at bitaddress.org to see how they do it.  Doing a x=rnd();  is almost certainly insecure so most use cryptographic libraries that offer a far slower but more robust random number generator.

The hash rate will match whatever the blockchain calculated over the previous 2016 blocks.
If only 20% of miners jump on the fork you can expect average blocktimes of 10mins x 20 = ~1hr min block times on any fork.
After another 2016 blocks (or 10 weeks) the readjustment will happen and blocks will return to every 10 mins.

I think what would be helpful is if LN wallets could agree to use a standard understanable unit for microtransactions.
bits/credits gets my +1.
mBTC is ok however you can imagine the story where people get invoiced for 0.1BTC and pay it when it should have been 0.1mBTC... somewhat scary difference.
For those crazy folks out there, I've even considered a log scale for pricing since most get magnitude not value.
E.g. 
1 = a loaf of bread.
2 = framed picture
3 = a bike
4 = a holiday somewhere
5 = a new car
It'd be easier to visualise a purchase on a scale like that but probably far harder for the public to grasp than mBTC ;)

Sure thing but if people have a choice between using product A that can be used anywhere or product B that is a subset of A, which has more value?  In the ELI5 approach, It is like the gift card idea vs cash.  Sure gift cards have their place but a gift card can never be bigger than the underlying asset driving it since people can swap the underlying asset to a gift card easily.
This is why centrally controlled crypto chains can never exceed the market cap of the largest market cap open chain available since a market will always exist for people to swap away from the lesser capable coin to the more open one.

So if miner I runs at say 90 hashs per second and miner II runs at 10 hashes per second, each time a solution is found there is a 90% chance it will be miner I that finds the solution, and a 10% chance miner II finds the solution.
I.e. each hash is an equal chance of getting a valid answer, it's just a race for the first miner to find a valid solution.  Once either miner finds a solution, both miners simply start working on the next block where again there is a 90% chance Miner I finds it and a 10% chance miner II finds the next block.

Ok, you may need a banking license to do this, definitely get a clued up lawyer involved from the outset.
Fractional banking is when you take the deposits from your clients to lend to your other clients (i.e. it's different to investing).  This is a ponzi scheme by anyone except high street banks who get a license to perform this trick.  Essentially it allows the bank to say you have $1000 in your account when they actually only have $30 because they've given out the $970 as a loan to someone else.  For you to do it without a banking license you have to be crystal clear that the account only has $30 in now, not the $1000.  
The reasons what you're attempting hasn't been done yet is as follows.  (I'm not saying don't do this, just saying do it right and don't end up another statistic.)
* Converting bitcoin to another asset only makes sense if you are confident the other asset will out perform bitcoin performance.  So far bitcoin is the best performing currency in the world for 6 out of 7 years it has existed so even if you converted the funds to an incredibly stable currency like USD you'd still have made a massive loss for your clients in comparison to just keeping it as bitcoin.
* Converting it to property again requires the property to have out performed it. This will happen in time but right now Bitcoin is still expanding, I doubt you'll find another asset that is comparable.
* If you make a loss, your clients need to know they've made a loss and you must be clear these risks from the outset.
* If you are investing your clients money you will need to adhere to AML/KYC laws.
* If you are lending out clients money you probably need a banking license.  Cryptocurrency is fine grey area but as soon as you start talking USD you need to be sure you're doing it correctly.
* Have controls in place.  What happens if you are hacked, who is insuring you?  
Also remember that just because people expect to get interest on bank accounts is not a good reason to suggest replicating this process in the bitcoin ecosystem while it's still growing.  Once the price is more stable (probably after decades) fractional banking may become sensible but right now it's nothing more than gambling with other peoples money.  
That said, there definitely is an opportunity for bitcoin bank to exist.  Just charge a negative interest rate not a positive one and don't do anything except offer insurance and security as features over making more bitcoin out of thin air IMHO.

Just buy a Trezor and follow the instructions. 
Essentially a private key is a fancy way of saying a password for a specific address.  All a wallet does is keep track of these passwords to access the coins stored at it's corresponding address.    The coins themselves are actually stored on the global blockchain database that is backed up on tens of thousands of machines around the world.
So the format is 
A 'seed' (12 words the wallet tells you) produces many 'private keys' (i.e. passwords) that produce the corresponding address where you receive money to.
This means you can lose/delete the device/wallet as long as you have a backup of the seed (or specific private keys), you can access your funds again from any computer at any time.
Wise move withdrawing your funds from coinbase onto a wallet where you own the private keys/seed.

You need to consider the on ramp too.  All those bitcoin that get spent were once purchased which produces the demand but you're right sometimes demand will rise faster than supply and visa versa leading to volatility.
Businesses will inevitably want their local national currency to do their accounting, this is a good thing and shows how bitcoin can work with national currencies well.
Bitcoin is merely how to express a globally recognised standard unit of value on the internet, i.e. regardless of source/destination country the value it represents is agreed globally at that instant.
At the moment, online bitcoin purchase advantages (security, push system, globally accepted, escrow possibilities) are somewhat outweighed by their negatives (difficult to obtain, tricky for people to understand how to use, volatility, tx fees).
In time those negatives will be addressed by developments such as LN, better wallets, more users leading to less volatility.  
This means whilst bitcoin is the gold standard for digital assets, cryptocurrencies haven't reached anywhere near their potential yet.  
As simple services appear abstracting how bitcoin works I'd expect to see more online adoption for global trade because of it's benefits that centralised systems simply can never offer.

POW change is the defibrillator option.  I.e. you need to see bitcoin die and exhaust all other options before this is viable.  The risk of the POW change is that not enough people support it so merely divides and splits the currency's value further.
Before people say bitcoin is dieing, the charts say otherwise.  There is growing support for bitcoin so this POW/BIP148/whatever is very unlikely to be taken seriously by anyone while the price per unit is still appreciating.
Honestly the most sensible option is btc owners sell their btc to invest in another coin to show they support the features on the other chain. At the risk of pumping LTC (and yes I do own a few now), if people want segwit/larger blocks/POW change, LTC is the obvious choice.  Litecoin is identical to Bitcoin but with those features (and a change in block frequency).
The fact is people aren't really moving to LTC hence I think the status quo of BTC leading will continue until something big happens.  
An obvious solution is those who offer BTC services start offering LTC services WITH Lightning Network support.  I.e. a simply iOS/Android wallet on LTC such as porting MyCelium and Bread to LTC will see a massive surge of BTC-&gt;LTC..  As BTC plummets this is when the miners will have to change their BTC segwit stance OR a POW swap will become inevitable when the price drops to say &lt; $500/coin.

For the love of everything don't start gambling to pay off your debts, this will inevitably compound to an even bigger issue.  
Unless you have vastly deep pockets there is absolutely no way to know what the price of bitcoin will be in the short term.  Buying options or shorts is a terrible idea if you're paying off debts.  
Please just explain (and prove if you can) to your friends you've lost the bitcoin due to cryptsy and be done with it.  
If you feel guilty about losing their money and feel it's appropriate you could offer to gradually replace their original cash amount but I think it's unreasonable for you to be liable for the exchange going down.
Legally that may not be the case however so you need a lawyer if they start getting legal.
HD seed is a 12 word phrase that describes a root number that derives many private keys.  With a wallet like MyCelium, Breadwallet or Copay, you get given this HD seed that you write down.  With just those words you can access your funds on the blockchain, i.e. only you control the private keys so even if the wallet provider disappears you can still access your bitcoin.

All good questions...
Don't know of CoinHako so can't comment on their systems.
Actual bitcoin transactions from A to B can only happen if you specify the address B... the transaction happens or it doesn't (or it lingers for a few weeks if you put a low fee on it).  I.e. the funds will still be under your control.
Sending money to/from an exchange, you have to trust the exchange will honour the deposit/withdrawal... i.e. you don't own those bitcoin, they are IOUs from the exchange until you actually withdraw the funds to a bitcoin address you have the private key to.
If bitcoin reached 100k, it means there are people willing to buy at 100k by definition.  You can trade 0.00001btc to your local currency (or service/product willing to be sold for btc) if necessary.
Tx fees can only rise as high as people are willing to pay for them.  It's a fee market.  It's in miner's interests to accept the highest fees people are willing to pay but there is no harm in them taking lower fees if there is space in a block to add them.  It's an interesting economics strategy still being discovered by the experiment.
When LN and drivechain/sidechain/treechains exist, it will also effect the tx fee, usually making it incredibly cheap in exchange for convenience, tieing up funds for a period of time or exposing personal information s
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:55:56
There is no simple direct link. More or less miners doesn't really change the rate new bitcoin are introduced to the system.
It can indirectly have an effect as with more miners used, more electricity is used which means more ₿ has to be sold to pay for the electricity.
The contribution it makes however is much less than how traders influence the market with long/short positions, new developments or general hype.

Coinbase is fine to buy them but install an HD wallet on a safe machine (like an iPhone) and withdraw your coinbase bitcoin to your wallet you actually control.  Use a wallet like MyCelium, CoPay, Breadwallet, or perhaps invest in a hardware wallet like a Trezor.
Write down the backup phrase and wallet you used.  
You can now safely delete your wallets and just keep your backup phrase (in multiple safe places in sealed waterproof envelope) you will be able to get access to your funds in future by just reinstalling the wallet and typing the backup phrase in.

Keep in mind flaws and strengths are very subjective when it's not clear what the target area is.
For instance is bitcoin intended to be a global currency, a global commodity, a proof of existence database, an id system, a stock exchange, a bartering tool, a spam iliminator, an insurance policy system, inheritance, bank replacement, method of exchange, etc...
Keep in mind a flaw in one may be a positive in another.  The fact is bitcoin is incredibly useful in all of these areas, it has strengths and weaknesses when compared to currently used systems but what might be seen as a weakness now could actually be a strength.
For instance... the fact there are no charge-backs possible with bitcoin's low level protocol.  Mr Gates said this was a weakness, but if you consider a merchant layer on top is what's required to offer refunds, receipts, delivery information, etc.. this is no longer a weakness and you can see why it shouldn't [edit] be part of every transaction.  
In fact the main reason people want charge backs is they think the product was defective and want a refund... with these timelocked escrow payments they eliminate the need for refunds for most purchases in a way we've not seen before.  Right now this is a pain in the ass to do and doubt many use it but in time this will become trivial as the wallets and UIs offer simple ways to say tap 'escrow this for 2 weeks'.

I believe in Bitcoin and it's potential to be the GMT equivalent for money but my list of issues I'd love to see addressed are here...most can and will be easily addressed with technical or political help so nothing major but it's some thoughts for historical purposes to see if any of this ever comes true.
The potential issues I've spotted are
1) It's usability is a royal pain, especially to non technical people.  This is holding it back from mass adoption, I have people ask me 'how do I get some?' and it's not a 3 second answer (at least here in the UK).  BitPay, Coindesk and BlockChain have done some incredible things simplifying it so far but much much more needs to be done before going mainstream.
2) Again, just like point 1... It's very very raw and easy to have your money stolen if you don't know what you're doing.  Most people wanting to be involved in bitcoin have done the research and understand only by having your own paper wallet you've created offline is going to be good protection against most theft.  I'd hazard a guess that 99% of bitcoin users haven't done this and/or wouldn't dare do this as can be terrifying to willingly delete the account from your computer.
As an example, the FBI 'owns' a bunch of coins, they're in a good position... unless of course they have put those coins in an account where someone else knows the private key.  Imagine if the department had let one (or even worse more than one individual) create that address by themselves and online! Doh! What happens if the coins mysteriously move to another address??? The individual would be freaking out if they're innocent as they're looking at jailtime regardless if they did or didn't do it.  
My bet is this isn't in an offline generated paper stored address since they appear to have put all their eggs in one basket so clearly new to this,  not taking it seriously or merely know something I've overlooked.  Anyhow if they magically move from one basket to many in the coming weeks it's case and point that even the experts are just learning like the rest of us.
3) There is not enough regulation/validation of bitcoin exchanges... we keep seeing them pop up only to vanish with everyone's money and no recourse.  There needs to be a credible global certificate saying 'this company is legit and safe to send your money to'.  This could be political or technical but really does need to be done to stop the thieves.
4) There is very little that can be done if you get ripped off and want a refund.  This is paypal's strength... for this reason it's what makes me believe Bitcoin is best used for large transactions between trusted institutions who want no fees to pay and expect no refunds (or at least they trust them enough to issue the refund).  
The general public want this refund option if the goods are rubbish and why Paypal and banking has a good place in the economy for the foreseeable future.  As soon as PayPal or other banking institutes accept bitcoin as payment this could be incredibly disruptive since it gives the protection consumers want and the ability to store value outside of banks.
Mastercard, Visa, bitpay, paypal, etc.. they stand to annihilate each other in this game by being the first to marry the advantages of proven fiat usage with a decentralized global digital commodity to back it.
All those points said, Bitcoin by itself is still vastly more reliable and useful than any other commodity out there, these above factors seem to only slow growth rather than limit it and over time each looks to be addressed so Bitcoin's future does look rather positive.
So much so it really does seem to have the potential to become the common global commodity all currencies are based around.

Agreed, a lot of money will be converted from usd/euro balances to btc and immediately withdrawn from exchanges to minimise risk which would put the price of btc up.
That being said, logic seems to go out the window when day trading.

Countries already have lots of sensitive numbers under lock and key, not sure how a private key is that much more different.   
Bitcoin however adds another layer of security in that they could have say a 4 of 5 transaction locks the funds. 
If it was for this much as well they could probably even use a multisig address with a hardware security modules deriving the keys.  That is pretty darn secure since you'd have to physically break in somewhere and coerce others to give up their keys to make a transfer.

You won't be able to mine any significant bitcoin with that hardware (probably less than a cent in a year), it needs to be vastly more powerful.  These days you need dedicated ASIC hardware to even mine a few cents a day.
You can however mine alt coins, perhaps look at ethereum, dash, zec, iota or some even more obscure ones.  Once you have some alt coins you can trade them on various exchanges for some bitcoin.

You're right, digital 'cash' is nothing new and keeps getting reinvented, Bitcoin is merely the latest incarnation of digital 'cash' and builds on past weaknesses as far as I can tell. Bitcoin is far from perfect, there are glaring issues that have appeared since it's becoming more widely known (usability, safety, scalability for small transactions, mining inefficiency) however it does have some very strong qualities never seen before which is why it has been a game changer and we might finally be at the stage where people can really use it plus most of these weaknesses can still be resolved over time.
* It's decentralized so no single point of failure.
* It's open source so anyone can make their own clients to interact with the protocol.  There is no 'owner'
* It's proof of work mining system encourages the network to reinforce itself.
* It's a finite resource of 21 million units so you know people can't cheat the system to dilute your earned share.
It looks like Digicash built on top of the paypal/bank transfer system by allowing anonymous distribution but it's fundamental weakness appeared to be a centralized system owned by a company so if the company fails everyone loses their 'money'.  This weakness is now addressed hence why it's different from the others but who knows if this is the ultimate digital currency of the future, all we know is it's done fairly well over the last 4 years.

Just politely close your account with them.  Might be worth a letter to their manager as to why you're closing your account.  This will eventually show which banks are pro consumers and which are anti-bitcoin, survival of the fittest and all that.
Remember if you pull out your money you're also pulling out their fractional banking reserve meaning they lose about 5x your account balance.
Might also be worth a letter to your local newspaper (&amp; governer/mp), banks love publicity like this ;)

Actually banks can do fractional banking with bitcoin, if it takes off it's almost inevitable.  The key difference is you don't need to use a bank to store your earned value so if fractional banking isn't for you there is now a viable alternative.

bitcore is entirely self hosted, no external communication to bitpay.
It's actually just a bitcoind client but gives you lots of javascript stuff to call into for wallet manipulation.
Node.js is definitely worth learning, miles easier to stand on the shoulders of others but it does take a bit of time thinking how the async nature of it works... if you do javascript coding already that part will come easily.

I think good on them trying to find ways to monitise it BUT they should have an ad free version that can be purchased.  I'm happy to send them $2-5 for the wallet... probably offer a subscription or IAP for the person to person exchange feature?
They'd also do well just getting a few select trusted exchanges integrated (exchanges to pay mycelium for say a year) to fund it all.  The exchanges will be happy with the extra customers, mycelium can continue to be an independent open source wallet.

Move any funds you're not daily trading with into your own wallet where you have the private key.  bitaddress.org is the best place I've found for creating your own personal offline wallet (make sure you save the html page to your desktop, unplug your computer from internet when creating your secret new addresses!).  
This way regardless to if the exchange disappears you always have your funds. 
Blockchain.info is easier appraoch than an offline wallet and allows you to have your private key too so should they disappear you can still get your funds easily.
They do have your private key (albeit encrypted) so could be a security risk to be cautious about if securing millions.
All your eggs in one basket and all that...
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:58:48
Personally I can't see it becoming a daily currency simply because of the technical issues on instant transactions and the political issues that inevitably pop up (the euro is a great example of how hard this is)
That said though it has huge potential as investment/security and large transaction usage where other commodities are currently used.  
**The most dramatic outcome would be it's potential to become the common basis of money in the world much like GMT is for time.**  If that happens £100k per coin is vastly undervaluing it and I'm not sure how to even start calculating that!
So ignoring the larger potential uses of this, let's just imagine it only takes the role like gold as a value storage mechanism...
Gold 171,300 tonnes at $37,155,844  per tonne
122x more bitcoin available than tonnes of gold.
1Bitcoin maximum worth could be $304,556 = £190,347 but given a modest equal share of gold/bitcoin is used as an equilibrium of stored value we can say half which works out at a round £100,000 / btc.
Whilst saying a number like this will be laughed at by any serious financial institute it's not insane when watching what it has achieved in only 4 years.
  In my opinion this would only potentially happen when BTC is easier to use for traders as the learning curve is far too step for most to want to even consider owning some.  If traders don't understand how to safely buy and sell it through the regular channels they trust it will be deemed too high risk to offer to their clients.  If however BTC appears in a brokers portfolio as another commodity this starts to become a very real possibility which I believe is what is being worked on at the moment.
Regarding the 'enough to go around' there are 21Million units with 8 decimal places of subdivision.  I.e. you could own 0.00000001 BTC.  Even at the valuation of £100k/BTC that's still £0.001 so should be ok for general trades.
If needed I believe the protocol can also be changed to support more than 8 places but this easily covers all the money in the world being currently traded through it so not going to be needed for probably our life times.

I'd argue that website's interpretation could be easily challenged, people don't hold digital currencies since that is on the global blockchain.  
They simply may have access to funds but they haven't traveled with them any more than they traveled with the cnn website.
I.e. this ruling could apply to someone bringing in a 10 btc Casascius coin valued &gt; $10k but not by them potentially knowing a password to spend bitcoin funds.  Doing the later is just full on absurd that I can't see how it could ever be enforced, once again it would only apply to law abiding citizens since those with nefarious intent would simply not admit it.  
Unless they change the law to guilty until proven innocent it is unworkable for any sort of crime prevention.

A few points to be aware of... 
- Most of the 60GH+ devices are vapourware so be cautious.  Only buy with PayPal would be my top tip.  Check out the delivery timeframe of previous hw and make sure you're prepared to sit through delays of many months perhaps up to a year.
Many are selling preorders which they use the funds to actually develop the kit with.  Not a bad thing but you need to bare in mind that they are doing this for profit and it's in their interest to hold back shipping hw as once it ships the difficulty goes up and their hw looks less appealing.
Another consideration is that mining by it's very design is intended to be a break-even exercise over time where the amount of BTC received shoudl cover the cost of electricity + a slight margin as an incentive to leave the machine on.  That margin may be negative as there are people out there with access to free electricity so their cost is just the depreciation on the hw.
Thirdly there are so many people doing this and queued up to do this it's a mugs game to join in now.  By the time you get your HW you'll be lucky to cover your costs and it's only BTC value improving that has made it less painful for most miners.  
That's the other important point, if you're looking to do this as a hobby that's one thing but if you're doing it to make money be cautious.  Anyone who bought BTC rather than mining equipment will have made *far* more money over the last year.
If it helps my 30Gh machine brings in about ~0.02BTC/day depending on the value of BTC and the pool's luck.  4 weeks ago it was generating around 0.06BTC so you can see how quickly this is decreasing.  I for one won't be buying any more mining equipment, only btc.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:48:05
This is my view as well.  Either I need some more info on how this is expected to work long term because without miners supporting the weaker PoW chain will by definition become an alt coin like ETC/ETH did with ethereum.
I should keep my mouth shut though since it means it doubles all btc savings at the detriment of people picking the opposite chain that inevitably wins.
I've tried to highlight this, got downvoted like never before so my main concern is some smart individual(s) realise this and are gaming the community to force a split whatever the cost only to rob them later with shorts and a massive dump of the coins on one side or the other.
Like I said though, I might be wrong... guess we just wait and see how it plays out.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:52:03
What is the first number/letter it starts with?  If it's a 5 or 6 it is most likely your private key to access the funds on the blockchain, i.e. think of it as the password to spend your money in the global database.
You just need to import that private key to a wallet you trust and you'll get access to spend your 1.4 bitcoin.
I believe wallets like mycelium allow you to sweep a private key but I've not tried myself.  (Sweep means transfer all the coins held at the address your private key accesses to a new address that the wallet controls, import means it doesn't move the coins until you actually go to spend them.  Whenever possible sweep coins as it's generally safer).
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:41:51

* do a bitcoin video on how to use bitaddress safely, etc...

They seem safe to me (been using one for over a year now with no problems).
Blockchain is the best online wallet I've seen to date and seem very trustworthy but because it's online it does have an element of risk.  Ultimately if Blockchain can send funds from your account it means they know your private key.  If they know your private key, if they get hacked there is a risk a very determined person could figure out how to decrypt the private keys as they are only encoded with a human created password.  (I expect this would be headline news if it ever happened!)
The problem is that if someone did get the private key somehow they can spend your funds even without blockchain's knowledge.
** This is highly unlikely but is a very very small risk there. **  There have been stories about people having an infected computer and lost coins this way which I would like to believe is far more likely than blockchain being compromised and all bets are off if your machine is infected.
I'd see any online wallet as where you'd store your liquid/spending money.  If you're just investing it for many years to come you probably want to move it to somewhere even more secure like a paper wallet.
The safest way to store significant sums of funds is creating and sending your coins to an offline paper wallet from something you trust like bitaddress.org.
Trezor does an amazing product but it isn't available just yet (*disclaimer I don't work for them!)  BFL labs are also about to release a hardware dongle too but not seen that either.
So in order or security I'd list it as
* Paper wallet (most secure but a real pain in the ass to setup and use)
* Elctrum (not used it but hear people say it's very good, again make sure you back up offsite!)
* Blockchain.info (very secure and allows you to get your private key should they disappear so you still have your funds)
* BitcoinQT/Multibit (Also allows you to have your private key but better make sure your computer is never infected)
* Reputable Exchanges (Bitstamp, Mtgox, etc..)  More likely to lose your funds via day trading mind.
* Dave on IRC (No disrespect to any Daves!) 
* Princess Naraba from Nigeria who has $$$ to send you

You have to consider the option that bitcoin may simply redraw the lines.

Are you running ubuntu or something else?
There is a parameter to specify where the blockchain data goes so you can point it to your external HD with that.
(I believe it is -datadir on command line or you can modify a bitcoin.conf file to have a line with datadir=(your external drive path here such as /media/mydrivename/blockchaindata/mainnet)
HOWEVER... my experience an external drive does not work very well.  Firstly it's slow, like really slow at syncing.
I left my machine on for over two weeks before giving up sort of slow.  I have to admit this was v0.13 and apparently 0.14 is much better.
Secondly, and my main issue, if someone knocked the USB while the computer was on it corrupted the DB.  This meant an entire chain rescan was necessary, i.e. &gt; week of downtime.
Basically you can do it but it's risky and bitcoind will punish you hard if there is a hardware fault.

You are correct about the average of the 2016 blocks (24 hours * 6 blocks per hour * 14 days = 2016) But it's the first time I've ever heard of any limit on the +/- difficulty change allowed... it seems rather dangerous to have such a control.  Do you have a link or location in the source code for this 4x limit?  
From  it appears that there is no such bound and not sure why there would be since 2 weeks is a long time to average over anyhow.  We also haven't reached any limits +/- 400% change recently, each adjustment has only been around +30% at most anyhow and is simply due to more asics flooding the market.
*The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.*
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:08:50
Think of it as a method of selecting a random person around the world every 10 minutes who can verify the last 10 minutes of transactions are valid and can therefore be added as the next block in the ever growing blockchain that everyone shares.
It's done by 'miners' picking random numbers until a number is found that is good enough to answer the maths problem.   The more numbers you can guess, the better the chances are you're the lucky winner who gets to verify it and receive 25BTC for your work.
These days it's unlikely one person will win so instead people group together in pools to contribute and share the winnings to get more regular payouts. (Just like lottery syndicates)
On average, every two weeks the difficulty of this problem is adjusted so that if the same computing power was used again for the following two weeks it would take on average 10 minutes to find an answer each time.  This means as computers can do more 'guesses' the difficulty rises so it becomes an arms race in having the most efficient and fastest hw.
The number of guesses done on one ASIC device is probably equivalent to trying to solve it on 10,000+ laptops.

There's nothing stopping you from changing the code and running your own version of bitcoin.
If however you break the consensus rules everyone else is running your traffic will simply be ignored.
In order to create a valid block to transmit to others you need to find a valid hash on a valid block of transactions.
Only one person around the world every 10 minutes (on average) will find a solution so most nodes are merely forwarding the valid blocks others found (and new pending transactions waiting to be included in a future block).
Mining is something that is done online.
To find a valid block (mining) you need to run around 5,240,120,546,000,000,000 hashes per second for a 50% chance of finding a solution in 10 minutes (yes you've read that number correctly, your home high end PC with latest graphics card can probably only do 10,000,000 transactions/second at most).  Or put another way, if you spent over $2,000,000 per day with the most efficient mining equipment around to get a 50% chance of finding a valid block that credits you 12.5 btc.

Sorry but I would use a bitcoin bank.

They will typically use a pool, if not stay clear as you're likely to get 0.  I.e. they'll be able to pay out at around 0.001 BTC/day  per Gh via a PayPerShare style contribution.
All the deals I've seen on Ebay and the likes are a poor return for the buyer, they typically get half the coins than just buying them from an exchange.
There is however a reason to buy into thiese
- Some people like the idea of 'freshly mined' coins with no history associated.  If it's coming from a pool that may not be true but worth a look.
- You don't need to use an exchange to buy the coins
- It's a bit of fun to say 'yes back in 2013 my father actually mined some of those satoshi's you're paying for your dinner with' ;)

Good responses and great you're following it but I must correct this misguided statement...
*'mostly used for shady transactions if I'm correct' *
Incorrect (or at least please, please back up your definition of **mostly** since the example of SR closure and supply/demand shows a contradiction to this statement)  
I'll be blunt, using an online fully tracked system public ledger like bitcoin for illicit purposes is for idiots.  Full stop.  If you think otherwise, ask a forensic expert on their opinion as you might think I'm being biased.
Yes you can't usually identify and state someone's guilty based purely on a transaction in bitcoin unlike with a bank account, however if something illegal happens it will get investigated via good policing channels. (Subpoenas of servers and exchanges used in facilitating the transaction for instance to gain evidence and identify individuals for example).  
When they have sufficient grounds they can arrest a person, access their computer and low and behold they are very likely to know which bitcoin addresses are theirs and therefore ALL the bitcoin transactions they've ever done and quiz each transaction's purpose.
In this way Bitcoin can be used as undeniable concrete evidence to help rightfully prosecute any law breaking individuals only once the person has raised suspicion worthy of investigating *via the crime* rather than a 'big brother is watching' style monitor everyone's transactions.  Is this not the society we've been encouraged to aspire to?  Innocent until proven guilty and all that?
Yes there are issues to be addressed to ensure these exit points back to local fiat currency are well regulated and we seem to be getting their voluntarily already. My point is that this connection to the underworld is just media sensationalism on a very small % of uninformed users, most Bitcoin users see it as a very valuable means of trading for legal and ethical purposes. (E.g. donating, avoiding your savings being unfairly eroded, making instant purchases without paying a crazy commission)

Urgh... firstly this is rayher clickbait title as he actually says some reasonable things and is basically open to bitcoin in future but right now has some concerns (mainly unfounded IMHO but understandable as everyone should be slightly skeptical until they find they actually need to use it)
 I do have issue with a few comments that keep reappearing and are so misguided.
"And the huge amount of energy consumption needs to keep it operating is significantly less efficient than the system of the central bank "
This is not an argument for or against it's success, this is merely a consequential fact when people use it.  The reason it takes so much energy is because it's economically viable to do so.  If energy becomes more expensive it levels out.  
It is identical to saying seatbelts are the leading cause for cancer rates increasing simply because people are now living longer... of course it is but that's an inconsequential byproduct not a reason to why seatbelts will eventually be doomed.
The other issue I have is that he seems to think a country would never allow cryptos to pay taxes... this is rather misguided as it wasn't long ago in human history people paid with gold or other precious items.  The reason we don't do that anymore is because cash and then banking made it more convenient at the expense of not actually owning the value.  Bitcoin has the advantages of digital banking AND users own their value, not the bank... so as a citizen would it be better for their country to have fictious fiat or a true global currency... if I were a country I know which one I'd rather be paid in so doesn't seem far fetched that some countries may actually allow this and therefore increase demand from other countries to follow suit.  
Where he is 100% correct is that many people are heavily speculating ready to convert bitcoin or whatever back into their local currency and see a blip profit... that is perfectly fine but misses the bigger picture here.  Once sustainable micropayments are solved in crypto there will be a tidal change in how govs will want to use this... 
It doesn't take much to imagine a gov pledging to remove unnecessary private banking from gov payments if ti becomes easy.

Thing is no country wants to be left behind in this technology race so it's unlikely a government would be foolish enough to try and ban it before there's a good reason to.

You take a hash of all the transactions you've verified, along with a transaction of 25btc to your address as well as the mining 'nonce'. The mining nonce is merely a number that you increment by one for each next try to find a solution.  With that hash, call it x, you do a SHA256(SHA256(x)) to get Y, a very very big 256 bit number which can essentially be considered random but 100% reproducible with the value of X. The resulting number Y needs to be less than Z to be accepted by everyone where Z is calculated by the difficulty.  So a lower Z makes it a harder problem to find a nonce to solve it.(forgive any over simplifications and errors but should give a more in depth description than the lottery cards analogy)

If it helps I lost my bitcoin virginity dip back in April, freaked out and couldn't understand why people were selling so sold some myself, now I look at the price at well over 4x that high and kicking myself in selling them so cheap!  Since found out the longer bitcoin users have been through this many many times and is now water off a ducks back.
It reassures me there is always demand as long as 2 or more countries allow them so best to ignore day to day trades unless you're chasing a quick buck (i.e. gambling).  
Next time it dips I'm buying like crazy as now USA and China are on board so set for an insane rollercoaster ride again.
It'll either be sky high or smash into the floor, the next 3 or 4 years is probably all it will take to find out.
It's almost certainly the biggest potential ROI opportunity we will ever see in our lifetimes.  So sit back, turn the computer off and relax before following a herd off the cliff :)

I'm a tad confused, so you're saying 3 years ago when btc was about $600/btc you took $6000 from each of your two friends for the 10btc.  25% of this was to go to alts so you actually took around $7500 from each person or $15k in total?
Now you're saying they want their coins but you haven't got them because they were held in cryptsy which is now defunct?
If they are friends they should realise you're unable to repay them and understand what has happened.
You may like to explain to them that the coins were hacked/stolen and see what they say.   Even offering their initial investment back is more than they should expect.
That's all good and well if they are friends.  If they are getting legal however you need to lawyer up because I don't think anyone on reddit can offer financial advice in a situation like this.  I'd expect you need to get them to join the class action suit against cryptsy and try to work out a compromise without getting courts involved where no one benefits.  I.e. they need to consider that money a write off and getting anything good back is a bonus.
I think the direct answer is they should have realised it was high risk and sadly their own fault being lazy in deferring the task to you who trusted another exchange to keep their funds safe.  At the end of the day this is only money, writing off a $15k investment isn't that big of a deal, as long as you haven't stolen it I think you should be able to explain it and they'd understand.
Perhaps it might be enough to just show them how to do it properly now so they can have their own HD seed?
If however you got funds out of it and they didn't you might sleep better at night contributing some of the funds back to them.

So the blockchain is simply a massive file (well set of files in a directory) that is stored on every machine that runs a bitcoin node.
If you install the bitcoin software from 
it will set you up as a bitcoin node. 
This will connect to other people running the bitcoin software and will download (and check) the blockchain files to your computer.
You do not need to run a bitcoin node to interact with the bitcoin network but you are free to do so if you wish.  
Many nodes are open to anyone to connect to and submit their transactions so you can interact on the bitcoin network without running a node yourself.
So to answer your question... the bitcoin 'servers' are just people running the bitcoin software on their own machines and the network updates itself automatically.  I.e. it's decentralised with no controller or owner.

*(If you just rolled your eyes, you’re not alone.)* That line is dreadful as it's childish editorial content dismissing something the writer thought was worthy of researching, found they didn't have enough time to understand it and needed to dismiss why they couldn't explain it in a schoolboy mentality.
They should have simply not mentioned any technical specifics of how it works as these are irrelevant for their target audience, it's more interesting to focus on it's potential impact on the commodity market and WHY people are trading them.
Currency, gold, fine art, 1st prints, etc... they all have value the same reason Bitcoin does... it's a finite resource.
Bitcoin also offers
- Unlike currencies, it is a very limited resource where the 21 million units will never ever change.
- Significant demand given the market is worldwide, not a local auction.
- It can be traded electronically without any 3rd party involvement at all anywhere in the world.
- There are 0 storage costs.
- It is not owned or controlled by one organization meaning it is very robust and incredibly difficult to 'stop'
- It's got a positive feedback system that the people who own coins want the system to work well.
A good article should be stating the facts in an interesting way and let people draw their own conclusions.

I'm no litecoin advocate by any stretch but litecoin doesn't seem to really improve on Bitcoin (quicker confirmation times?? Most people use 0 conf times in Bitcoin unless it's large sums of money so can't see this winning any war.
For that reason it is a complementary challenger.
Ripple scares me, that seems like a private company that will either flop or go through the roof.  If it goes through the roof it's the antithesis of what Bitcoin is for.
So currently we have Mastercard vs Visa of cryptocurrencies... There's usually a market for more than one to diversify risk.  If you kill one of them, another will pop up and may anhilate the other with a good feature improvement (zerocoin, or a better mining system, or a system that escrow everything, etc...)

Most people won't accept PayPal due to cancel/refund chargeback possibility... ebay is probably the only place you may find this option but I'd be cautious as you aren't covered by ebay's terms since they don't allow purchasing virtual currency on their site (yet).
localbitcoins is a great way to do it in person so you can hand over cash for coins sent to your address.
Alternatively, open an account on bitstamp,mtgox, etc.. but that takes time to do for the verification process.

Calculating the mining value can be done in [thegenesisblock.com](
Mining always works towards the equilibrium of cost of mining is only slightly less than the coins generated.  This means it's value can be calculated easily via every 10 minutes at 25btc is 144*25 = 3600btc per day generated for miners which in terms of electricity cost = up to $2million worth of electricity per day can be used.
Right now we're not quite at that equilibrium due to BTC value increasing so quickly recently but we are very quickly approaching it again and why people say investing in new hw now is likely not to see a ROI when compared with just purchasing btc.
It would be great to know if you see any other parallels from the early domain days as to paradigm shifts that happened and everyone should watch out for as bitcoin starts getting more awareness.

Bitcoin bubble bias...  Yes I'm biased as I support the protocol if that's what you mean,  it should be obvious given we are on but my intention is far from hyping any 'bubble' or Bitcoin hysteria.  I've been on Bitcoin for quite some time before all the media attention, cryptocurrencies are a major progression on the internet and looking here to stay.  
With people using browsers to navigate the web it would be great to see one of the opensource major browsers embrace this and trial accepting the bitcoin:// tag for instance but I realize this is probably a long way off.  
Allowing people to donate via this medium to gauge the market seems a sensible request given they are after funding, it helps judge the market's support of cryptocurrencies and helps reinforce how useful Bitcoin can be.
Imagine a browser that pops up saying 'download this webapp for $0.69' so developers get paid without needing to use their bank or paypal, or have an email system whereby you receive an email to your 'important box' only if it has a private BTC key attached and if it's spam the receiver just clicks SPAM and takes their money to make spamming far less viable.  There are so many ideas that BTC opens up but we need browsers to support it before many of these possibilities are really feasible as cryptocurrencies are not userfriendly yet.
I like Mozilla and I stand corrected on their research (thanks for the link) but as far as I can tell they fell behind during WebGL initiative (which is why I left Firefox), on mobile they are non-existent (at least on iOS, not sure about win8 or android) but finally have an opportunity to pioneer and lead again to make them stand out from Chrome and IE... it would be great to see them take this tiny step of trialling Bitcoin or at least explain why they are being hesitant to be the first so if there are genuine issues people can look to help.

Depends what you mean, exchanging fiat currency for bitcoin and back again, yes they're the main routes  I.e. online exchanges like bitstamp, mtgox or in person (or buy buying novelty items like casascus coins that can be trusted).  If you're a business you can use services like BitPay which will automatically pay into your fiat local bank account any received bitcoin at the current market price.
Once you have bitcoin you're free to trade them with someone using the online wallets like blockchain.info or run something like multibit on your PC to transfer them yourself.  This way you're now able to make trades anywhere in the world without needing any bank.

Generally they are all copy/pastes of Bitcoin's source code with a search/replace on the name.  Most are scams (like Quarkcoin).
Litecoin is interesting as a backup should Bitcoin encounter a flaw with the heavy adoption... whilst unlikely it's always good to have a backup.
Ripple is a private company funded venture and doesn't share any codebase and is different.  Personally not my cup of tea as it's a private company so if they go bust or their debtors can't honour the debt it's useless... most of all it's too complicated for most to understand it so can't see it going mainstream.
At the moment, none of the altcoins offer anything of significant advantage (hash algorithms, confirmation times are all technicalities that don't really mean much in the day to day usage).  
Freicoin is however rather interesting, it essentially has a tax built in to avoid hoarding wealth and in my eyes is more of a currency.  It may well be the best social currency around but still needs a lot of work and is a hard sell to anyone to use given they're designed to lose value over time to encourage spending.
Bitcoin is more just a commodity that happens to be readily accessible around the globe without a 3rd party needed to broker it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:04:01
Quantum computing sounds like it won't be able to break bitcoin's hashing (as far as I currently know about it) so mining is to remain secure for the foreseeable future.  As I understand it though, one day it **may** be possible to break the public/private key relationship via quantum computers but only when you spend from an address is the full public key available to begin this process.  This means if it becomes possible we should just start using clients that ensure any change you receive is given to a new address and again the system should be protected against quantum computers.
Regarding the GDP of $14 trillion, surely it's best to explain GDP in a currency other than the local one... but which one?? This is what BTC can also do, give a common ground for all currencies to base themselves around since it's easily tradeable anywhere in the globe making them a common language of true value.
So at 1BTC=$1000 for simplicity we have a US GDP of 14 million bitcoin.  
Now given there aren't 14 million bitcoin's currently available (even if you could somehow convince everyone around the world to sell all of them for USD), this is why BTC has the potential to become the GMT of money given it's pure supply/demand and if that perception ever starts to happen the $1000/btc is vastly undervalued.
Equally it could however also have a fundamental flaw that is yet to be discovered which makes it worthless somehow... it's still an early days experiment so who knows!

Lovely idea for the casascus replacement now they're no longer available (as far as I know).  Would be good to have the public address printed on it with QR code to accept incoming payments without nfc.

SHA is only a hashing algorithm, not an encryption one so not to worry.  
It's main purpose in Bitcoin is to create a hash of the transactions + nonce value (the nonce is what is incremented by the miners).  When this resulting hash has a value lower than the current network difficulty that miner can stamp the block and receive the mining bounty (25btc at the moment) to their own address.
So if SHA is 'cracked' it could mean that they say 'this is the value representing the transactions, this is the resulting hash value I need, what is the nonce value I should use?'
(For completeness I should mention it's hash = SHA(SHA( transactions + nonce )) so a little harder)
It is however conceivable that someone finds a 'reverse function' for SHA256 in which case it's a trivial fix to change the version number in the block header from Version1 to Version2 and just start using for V2 blocks and life continues like you say.  The blockchain doesn't need to start again, it may produce a fork for anyone who hasn't adopted the latest protocol change but eventually would be ironed out just like the many forks before it.  For day to day users they'd be non the wiser anything has even changed.
So as I understand it, cracking SHA isn't really a problem for Bitcoin (it may annoy the miners who have invested a fortune in dedicated SHA HW) but life would continue.  Actually if it is reversed somehow I doubt anyone would ever mention it since they now effectively an infinite speed mining machine which would print them a lot of money in mining rewards unless people cottoned on to SHA256 was compromised.
If however the elliptic curve encryption is 'cracked' that's probably more serious since now you can spend other people's money.  Again, if that's cracked the whole internet and banking system is in serious trouble before bitcoin is.
So to reassure you, it looks like cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

The speed of miners doesn't mean more bitcoins become available, they will always appear at 25btc per 10 minutes (on average) until 2017 when it goes to 12.5.    
Even if you put every bit of computing power in the world on it and somehow made them run 10,000,000x faster it would still only produce 25 coins per 10 minutes on average.  This is the entire purpose of difficulty and why mining approaches the equilibrium of electricity used in mining = the value of 25 btc.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:02:56
TL;DR I'm afraid so forgive me if I misread this but it seems to overlook the elephant in the room that mining on conventional CPUs or even GPUs is not even close to the speed of dedicated ASICs. You could have a botnet of 100,000 CPUs running full pelt 24/7 and still would not be comparable to a single modern ASIC box that can push out 1THash/second... that is why a botnet won't push out honest miners.

For day to day usage I'm with you on this, however I love the idea that I can travel around the world and be able to purchase items using this global commodity without paying any bank fees.
Anyone without a bank account can now use them, i.e. in remote locations or homeless.
Also if I'm purchasing a car or other high value item I can use bitcoin so I can drive away with the car within 10 minutes rather than needing to go to a bank to get a scary amount of cash out.

You need to find a way to randomly select a person around the world with an average time interval to verify the past and most recent transactions.  Fairest way discovered so far is this proof of work approach whereby you set a problem to be solved by brute force guesses and a solution can be instantly tested to be correct but very hard to find.  If the problem is solve in say 9 minutes instead of 10 (over a period of time) the difficulty of the problem is adjusted according to the protocol to make it harder so that at the next set of problems are solved in ~10 minutes again.  
This is what the CPU/GPU (ASIC now) cycles are spent on.  Yes it might seem wasteful as it's not solving anything else however each 10 minutes $20k is issued to someone so you need this robust and scalable way to randomly pick that person (essentially the faster your machine, the more guesses you try to find the winning ticket).
The problem's solution also has the key feature that this result shows the ledger was verified as valid and correct which secures the network.
Is it wasteful?  Yes and no.  Yes it uses a lot of energy but it's about solving this problem as efficiently as possible so no it's not wasteful.  **Essentially it works to an equilibrium whereby it costs the world the value of ~25Bitcoins of electricity to support the network which happens to be $20k/10mins at current exchange rates.**
If it becomes too expensive (e.g. electricity becomes more expensive, btc devalues, too many people mining) people will simply turn off their kit as it's no longer profitable, this causes the problem to get slightly easier and we return to equilibrium of marginal profit again.  This is why mining is a mugs game to get into nowadays, the ROI on new equipment may never be covered at the rate it's increasing.
Whilst we haven't reached that equilibrium as BTC value has rocketed and more efficient ASICs are being made, it will happen again very soon.
Best way to look at it is it is securing a multi billion dollar network, I would guestimate the energy wasted on digging up gold or running idle servers is **far** more than bitcoin's miners use.

Thoughts like this means we're likely to see a vast drop and fast bounce back again once again.  
What is daft is that as a community we all know panic selling makes the dip worse, as individuals though people will inevitably follow the herds even to the point of personal financial loss (especially anyone still unsure about Bitcoin's viability).
My top tip, if it crashes again, you'll find bitcoincharts, mtgox and others all inaccessible via attacks (or have been hacked to say or do something to invoke fear)  
During this time you won't be able to sell the coins at the big exchanges for probably 24 hours or more by which point it's at a much lower point. When you do get access again you may feel obliged to flog them before it drops in value any further in preparation for the upswing.  During this time is when the b*****ds who instigate it will be buying your coins at a lower price knowing that the price will soar now they have taken them out of circulation.
I want to be proved wrong but plan for this eventuality by holding fast to avoid joining the herd and losing out on your coins if you do see a service interruption and crash.

Yes, transfers aren't really stored on your computer, they're stored in the blockchain.  
Your wallet essentially just stores a list of your private keys to allow you to send money from the associated address.
As long as you didn't create a new address and send the coins there in the last two weeks you'll be ok.  If you did you may lose those only because you no longer have the key to send them anywhere... The fact that you're asking the question however makes me think you'll be fine.
(It may take a while as it scans the blockchain to find your transactions however).
Also make sure you back up your back up ;)
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:31:53
Theau1 is spot on, and to put it into perspective a 30GH machine currently produces around 0.01 coins per day.  So with a BFL little single device you'd 'on average' need to leave your computer on for 2500 days to win a pot which is about 7 years and going on the incorrect assumption difficulty will not increase.
Also worth noting however you could play the 'single number on a roulette wheel' style mining, i.e. gamble that you're luckier that most, let it solo mine and as soon as it wins take your bounty and flog the kit :)

Good question, I don't think anyone really knows yet.
Rest assured there's no such thing as a free lunch but the marginal costs are tiny in comparison to a credit card.  All the transaction fees need to do is be sufficient to keep some people mining, many mine at a loss now anyhow just because they want to support the ethics of Bitcoin.
Again it seems a perfect economics solution, if people need a transaction to get verified quickly they'll pay a little more and over time an equilibrium will be worked out... perhaps miniscule payments may get taken off the blockchain all together as do we really want to track every 0.0000001 transaction for eternity?    Also having chargebacks for day to day purchases like coffee/dvd's etc.. is quite appealing for customers and given customers outweigh merchants there is still a strong demand for PayPal and the likes.
Bitcoin excels in larger higher value purchases you don't want the risk of a chargeback on and/or to store value.
On that note, you don't need a transaction 'confirmed' in the blockchain to be picked up as paid.  As soon as you make a transaction it can be picked up immediately by the merchant, it's up to them if they want to wait for confirmation to ensure you haven't double spent/gaming the system somehow.  This is much like how credit cards work except their confirmation time is actually many days!
I should also note that mining new coins finishes in 2140 so we are very unlikely to know what happens when the rewards disappear but given how gradual it is a solution will have been worked out if Bitcoin is still in use. (Most media misreport this as 2040 for some reason but rest assured it's actually over a hundred years away)

Because there is no obvious way to tax it (yet)
Shouldn't make it outlawed but we do Need to pay taxes to keep our community working.

If you tell blockchain the incoming address they may be able to give the username that has no email associated and when it was created.
If he lost his pw he's stuffed though

Yes, and it happens all the time.  CPUs and GPUs and fPGAs are no longer economical to run to mine bitcoins, on average it costs far more in electricity than it produces in bitcoin.
Is this a problem?  Not at all, when it become unprofitable people just turn the kit off, the difficulty gets slightly easier as less people are mining so equilibrium is restored.
Right now we're in new hardware world of asic arms race where speed counts, while the chips keep getting more efficient and faster this equilibrium will take a while to reach but it will get there.
We're quickly approaching 14nm chips which is what Intel spends many years working with and is very hard to produce an asic with from what I understand, beyond that there's not much left in the arsenal to make them more efficient... at least with our current knowledge.  Making them faster just requires more electricity so not really a sensible game to play so is purely about how fast you can get it to go with minimal electricity.

Tell me about it, I actually tried approaching Pitcairn 
Thought it would be ideal as they are very small (only 48 people) and their name is close to Bitcoin ;)
Didn't get a reply so guessing they're not too fussed yet.

Take a peek at bitaddress.org.
You save the web page to your desktop, unplug your computer from internet and generate a paper wallet to print to(3 or more times)
Next clear cache, plug back into internet and transfer your funds there.
That's terrifying to do but the most secure way I've heard.
Brain wallets are dangerous apparently! They are can be compromised by brute force random guessing using book phrases, dictionary combos etc. may take years but is possible and once compromised they're gone.

It's good to question if bitcoin does suffer from this, let's face it currently there is a lot of buying on speculation rather than because we need it.  That said, the 'we need it' looks very likely to happen when big business realizes they can trade with it to cut their costs dramatically, that it helps anyone who doesn't have a bank account and that it offers the first digital commodity that can be easily traded.
If Satoshi had cashed out many of his coins I'd be inclined to consider it being a Ponzi scheme as we are all putting our fiat currency into this which is why the value grows.  The fact is he hasn't cashed out so either this isn't a ponzi or a few billion dollars isn't enough :)
Bitcoin still needs wider adoption by merchants and financial traders before it can very clearly show it will retain it's value... it's certainly looking on the right tracks so I'm still 100% behind it but always worth a sanity check when there is so much hype too.

'if the price goes up...' would you mind giving some facts or figures on why this is considered adverse to success? The price going up is only possible if demand increases, this seems contrary to harming it. 
I question if bitcoin is meant to become a currency, it seems more like any other commodity except trading can be done without a 3rd party and is the only finite digital resource so an incredible method to store and transfer value.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:13:21
Gives you options beyond needing to use banks or be tied to any particular organization since you now can store your own digital wealth.
Many things become possible that aren't with a bank, for instance you can receive payments by giving your address without fear of someone taking funds from your account like you can with conventional account/sortcode sharing.
Also it's the commodity of the internet, trading anywhere in the world instantly is a pretty big up side over banks.  
Finally my favourite parts are
* Instant trading around the world. 
* No chargeback risks
* It opens doors to things we haven't imagined yet, digital currency is the next step of the internet.

Would it be reasonable for miners to only accept the top X (say 1000 for simplicity) transactions per block.  When transaction 1001 arrives it drops off the lowest scoring transaction so there are only ever a maximum of 1000 transactions.  
score = (time in seconds since transaction x mining fee).  
The logic probably needs refining but this seems to generate an automatic market price for fees whereby the client can see what the average mining fee was in the previous N blocks.
The main issue that needs to be considered is when the 25BTC reward for miners becomes virtually 0 it's only mining fees that will keep the system running so they need to be reasonable.  
i.e. 
- Loads of transactions at small fees to cover costs
- Fewer transactions but larger fees.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:22:21
Yes and no.  You can identify the bitcoin address where each transaction has been sent from to your incoming address but it's unlikely you'll know who owns that address.
One approach is to give each customer a different receiving address so you know who you gave that receiving address to.  There is no limit to the number of addresses you can use but it might be best to cycle and reuse addresses just to simplify things.  You can then forward the transaction onto your main address and/or just add this receiving funds address to your wallet.

(blush) Yes sorry, and well spotted.  I totally undervalued bitcoin there.
Don't get me wrong, Gold is a good store of wealth too but has pros and cons too.  Firstly it's value is again supply/demand relationship, it doesn't have much tangible value other than it's scarcity (yes it's used in some electronics but is minuscule).  Secondly you typically need to pay someone to look after it, to buy and sell it.  If you live in a corrupt country it can be confiscated and certainly not easy to take out of a country.  Subdividing it is hard work.
Bitcoin has issues too.  Securing it safely takes time to read up on it.  Exchanges aren't all regulated yet.  It is new and takes time for people to grasp how it has value.  It's still being defined by governments on how it should be regulated.  The mining process is overly power hungry at it's current valuation/reward ratio.  There are scalability issues to overcome if orders of magnitude of people start using it as a currency.  
The upside of Bitcoin over gold however a few that stand out are
* It's a very predictable finite resource where people can truly own it and know the value of their savings in relation to the entire BTC economy.  Ironically this makes it quite stable in it's own ecosystem.
* It doesn't require storage costs.
* Very easily dividable.
* It can be traded anywhere in the world instantly without any 3rd party involvement.
* It can include true escrow transactions that you can't with a physical good like gold.
* You don't have to pump mercury into rivers and the air to constantly extract it, just lots of Co2 to make for longer summers :)

Anyone else here seeing the potential of topping up your PayPal account via bitcoin?  If they don't do it, someone will.  Now you have the power of consumer protection for everyday purchases and not overwhelm the blockchain, while your stored value can still be outside of banks if you prefer investing in commodities like gold and bitcoin?

Yes I'd be cautious about contracts and shared mining... if it's a sure thing they'd have gone to the bank to get a loan and do it themselves.  The fact they haven't should speak volumes.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:20:27
No one knows but at the moment it's definitely the leader and has it's value because you can only get them by trading with existing bitcoin owners.  For that purpose alone their valuation is going to remain higher than any other unless there is a fundamental flaw ever exposed which is looking less and less likely as the years go by.
