Help out a guy who hasn't thought about BitCoin much if at all.....
If you hide ten thousand backups of that One Million Dollar SanDisk chip all over the USA, does the first person to find one and steal it get all the money?

So sorry. 
Once someone bought my eBay stuff using a stolen credit card.
They shut down my Paypal and locked up the money for 180 days unless I faxed in my driver's license and stuff
But hell no I wasn't gonna do that!! !!!  What am I, stupid?
=== === === 
Interestingly enough, in 180 days I did get a check for the amount.

If that one million dollar SanDisk chip gets smashed with a hammer, does the one million dollars still exist?
If not, that's a pretty big problem.

May 24 to Jun 4 is 11 days, perhaps he was wondering what was taking so long for 11 days.  By Jun 7 he said "Fuggit, *I've* been scammed" and did the reversal, before 11a.m.

You would DEFINITELY get your account frozen, for 180 days in fact, while they sat on your money and collected interest.  Send them your passport, your driver's license, a blood sample.  It wouldn't matter.   Freezing accounts and sitting on the money is their most profitable activity.
