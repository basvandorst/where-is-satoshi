Just thought I'd provide an update.  I shifted over to CoinJar because of igot.com's shitty service (NOTE:  BTC TRANSFER IS STILL NOT WORKING!!!)  
Advantage of CoinJar:  1) it works; 2) it isn't a scam; 3) I was able to verify my identity to the highest level within a few minutes without human intervention (i.e. it is completely automated); 4) BTC transfer works immediately; 5) the website is easy to use (although I must admit I didn't have issue with the presentation of the igot.com website).
Thanks nopara73 for the recommendation.
Now I just need to wait until the igot.com service becomes active (it has been weeks) so that I can transfer my BTC to CoinJar.

Ok thanks - creating an account. Will transfer my BTC from igot.com if they all!

I'm sick of waiting for igot to resolve its "infrastructure" issues. Can someone recommend a reliable and reputable Bitcoin exchange (preferably one which I can sign up to without the rigmarole of verifying 100 points of identity)?

I registered a support ticket and was told by Julie (twice) that i'd simply have to wait until the issues are resolved.  I've since registered a coinjar account as I have no confidence in the service.

and why would that impact BTC to BTC transfers?
My transfer has been pending for weeks.  I have lodged support tickets and contacted your useless social media representative to no avail.  All you do Dan is peddle bullshit promises about an 'imminent' fix that never seems to surface.

so what's the revised ETA on service resumption? Pluck another date from the thin air? What a joke of a service. I genuinely hope others Google this mob before signing up so that they know what they are getting themselves into...

It has been 8 days since I initiated a bitcoin to bitcoin transfer and the transaction is still listed as "pending".  I contacted support and was advised of the upgrade in progress and that it should be resolved in a few days.  That was 3 days ago.  Which begs the question:  why is igot.com still accepting deposits when it knows it cannot honour any transactions due to its substandard IT infrastructure?

I tested the igot.com service by buying 1BTC two weeks ago.  I have jumped through the hoops of verifying my identity to the highest level (note - if you do not do this you will be limited to a daily transfer of 0.0005 BTC - aka 30 cents!).  Following the verification, I executed a transfer of a nominal amount of bitcoins (0.0005) to another wallet to test the service.  That was on the 30th May and the transfer is still listed as "pending".  I have since made another transfer of the same amount and that, too, is listed as "pending" despite 24hrs passing.  I raised a support ticket yesterday and am waiting a response.
For those looking for a decent/reliable/efficient exchange, look elsewhere.

Why are you wasting people's time asking them to email you or raise support tickets WHICH YOU KNOW YOU ARE UNABLE TO ACTION?

In the interests of fairness I would like to let the community know that igot finally processed my BTC to BTC transfer.  This was a transfer that was 3+ weeks overdue and probably only occurred because I generated a stink on social media.  I am grateful that I finally got my money back, but this does not excuse the lengthy period of service unavailability, the misinformation promulgated by their representatives as to when a fix was forthcoming, the unfulfilled promises of igot representatives, the inaction by Julie from their support team in arranging for requests to be transferred manually, the inappropriate and possibly unlawful practice of the organisation in continuing to accept bitcoin deposits when core features of the service remain unavailable, and the failure by igot to provide any compensation to affected users.
