If people didn't download stuff from the internet, you wouldn't see so many trojans and ransomware succeeding as much as they do :-)
The truth is that when something is very compelling, people will download apps. People downloaded Napster, for example, and people downloaded Chrome by the millions because they wanted a better browser than Firefox and Internet Exploder. So yeah, maybe it will take a while but if the case is very compelling, and once you have the app it's extremely easy to use (no further setup), I believe people will definitely download.
@_date: 2016-04-17 17:23:45
ZeroNet does something similar over http, except it has a local client that you need to download and run, which proxies to ZeroNet.
(So it doesn't solve the download problem, but does leverage the fact everybody has a browser)

You need to understand that while we techies who understand the protocol and the intrinsic value the technology is bringing to the world, the rest of the planet is massively disconnected from the technology.
Now you have a huge number of people who speculate on the Bitcoin currency with significant amounts of cash, who know absolutely NOTHING about Bitcoin (Currency, Protocol, or else). Let's not forget: What humans don't know, humans fear!
And the media? The media is what the media has always been: A fine line between tabloid rumors and exaggerated facts, designed to bring readers. Without sensationalism, the media moguls feel they are boring. Their cronies feel the need to create this sensationalism with retarded titles and infantile, fear mongering statements. It is what it is.
Bitcoin use has barely scratched the surface. It is going to be massive, and the value will sky rocket. All those technical issues are not surprising, and frankly, quite expected with the mass adoption. You have this technology that every hacker on the planet is basically trying to exploit. Someone was bound to take advantage of the TXID bug. If there are more bugs, someone will find it and take advantage of it. The exchanges, assuming they make good money, should hire talented security auditors. If they don't, they are committing a crime against themselves and their customers.

You can actually buy an OpenWallet.co ATM for $2500 ~ $3000 depending on features. And it does more than just sell BTC, it also vends other products, making the operator of the ATM even more money in the process. Because if you have an ATM already, why limit yourself to just Bitcoin?

It's really not so much about the language/stack used. A bad coder will produce horrible code in Python, Ruby, C, C++, Scala, Node, etc. I've even seen horribly written Bash scripts (actually most bash scripts are atrocious).
A great developer can totally write fantastic systems that perform really well, are well designed with proper architecture, employ gracious fallback and rollback mechanisms, using PHP. You just have to be smart, pay attention to detail, consider all the edge cases and handle them, profile your code, use TDD and perform proper QA, etc. The kinda stuff you would definitely expect a company to do if they write financial software.

You are 100% correct, and I am so, so glad he did this. It mirrors perfectly my opinion that the first country to adopt crypto will eventually become the richest country in the world. In fact I would recommend the to US regulators and government that we adopt it in a very deep manner, so that we may regain leverage against other countries (China comes to mind...).

You know what, I've had it with all the PHP drama. It's a programming language for the web, and it's extremely simple to use. Children use it. It's intended use is for pre-processing simple, readable code that produces dynamic web pages. Nothing more.
Sure, I prefer Ruby, Python or Java. They are way more powerful, and far better written. And PHP has been stretched way beyond the intended purpose, but if someone uses PHP to analyze and visualize a data set which ends up leading to a cure for cancer or aids, would you ridicule him for using PHP? I don't think so.
At the end of the day, it's a tool like any other. You can use an automatic rifle to kill a bird (Java/Ruby), but you can also use an old rusty hammer (PHP) to kill the same bird. The end result is that the bird is dead.

You would need whatever device is scanning the tag to write back to the tag. This means you need to trust that device, and it means that device will ask you for a password to unlock your previous private key, but if you trusted that device enough to enter your password on it, then maybe it's OK if it rewrites your tag with your new wallet...

Excuse me? The same bullshit was said about every scheme ever employed with customers. If that support interaction above is real, my reaction is: RUN AWAY!
Run away, while you can still move your BTC elsewhere. Just take your bloody coins, and hold them in your own local wallet. Do it ASAP!
All this libertarian crap went to people's heads too much. You are putting real money into someone's vault without knowing who they are? They hold the keys to your money! you bloody fools!

You may be right, but I wouldn't underestimate the rate of expansion, if only due to the fact that third world countries are poised to leapfrog the entire banking system by using cheap android devices as their wallets.

You're again talking like a man-child. It's not like every business ever attempted remained successful. You try, and sometimes you fail. You win some you lose some.
In the last 20 years the ATM business has seen tons of turmoil, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, etc.
And you know what? It's like every other business in any other field. 
All in all, you either are a user of the service or you aren't. You can't judge a person for trying a business.

Yes it is. Not all locations are born equal. In some places your ATM gets vandalized and tagged so often, the cost of parts labor and downtime prevent you from even breaking even. 
When I have to use a $3 or above ATM, I do the following:

2) thank TFSM that there’s at least an ATM available

@_date: 2019-03-18 06:34:56
No, it's not thousands. And the ATM operator doesn't take the entire $3 home. He shares some with the host (the store owner).
Source: I review revenue reports from ATM machines nationwide at least once a month. Some machines operate at a loss. Many ATM operators end up selling their businesses to bigger operators because they can't survive (with ATM it's a race to the bottom because the market is saturated, and you can't replace a competitor with your ATM machine unless you offer them a higher portion of that $3 fee).
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:06:46
What you're saying makes no sense.
What I'm telling you is based on real world experience with actual ATM operators. Many of their locations are operating at a loss. To add insult to injury, after they lost money on a location they then have to spend money on a technician who goes to that location and moves the ATM to another location.
Say you want to stop this from happening? You go and lobby congress and they cancel the 90's law that opened up the ATM market (before this law, only banks had ATM machines; the law was passed because banks failed to establish presence across the US leaving many communities without an easy way to access their cash).
Ultimately this is all bullshit because:
1) Hopefully crypto will eventually become easy enough for the common mass to adopt and use and trust
2) Nobody gives a shit what you think, if you don't want to pay a $3 fee just drive further to your bank ATM and extract your cash for "free".
3) Companies like VaultLogic.com and Maya.tech will make all of those old ATM machines obsolete (including bank ATMs).

It's in extreme times like these you find out which infrastructure you can rely on in a doomsday scenario. Any operation running out of the US should be considered unreliable. Same goes for Coinbase, Gemini, etc.
And let's be clear here: People at those operations mean well, but they are subject to the legal and political realities of the country where they operate. I know the people at Bitpay do not want this to happen, deep inside, but their hands are tied.

You'll see several parallel forces impacting the price:
Channel 1: People liquidating BTC to offset their FIAT liquidity losses.
Channel 2: People who have enough FIAT and will want to hedge against FIAT by going into crypto.
Channel 3: People who have enough FIAT and will take advantage of the low BTC prices.
Channel 4: People who will hear about BTC for the first time due to the recession, and will get in at ANY price (just like some people bought BTC at 18k+ not too long ago).

I absolutely disagree. And not just because after all, It’s a free market. I disagree because I measure the actual impact Coinbase has had on the crypto market since they launched: without Coinbase, a lot of people wouldn’t even be able to purchase BTC.
You may be a somewhat savvy crypto guy, and maybe for you managing crypto in your own wallet is easy. This is not the case for most people; for most of the world Crypto is too complex, too scary, too impractical, and definitely NOT ready for massive consumption.

We actually implemented this on OpenWallet kiosks, but in reverse. The Kiosk has a QR scanner. You run the OpenWallet passport app, authenticate with your pin code, and it generates a QR code which is an authentication token good for 1 minute. You show it to the machine, and it logs you into your personalized payments page. Kinda like "Authy", except you don't have to even type any digits into the Kiosk, and the pin code to the OpenWallet Passport app is the same pin code which you type in quickly.

If FinCEN created an online service where you made a REST call   to their servers with the KYC data you obtained, and returned an answer to you such as "Accept" and "Reject", it would be another story. But with current KYC protocols, all they can do is know that it happened much later, after the fact (if they are even searching through the data that's being submitted to them).
You see, the problem here is that there's probably some connection between FinCEN and intelligence agencies. If you could query FinCEN for an Accept/Reject, a criminal or terrorist could basically "query" that database to know if he's made their blacklist or not, and he would get advanced warning and know that it's time to hide in a cave somewhere in the rockies ;-)

I wonder who their recharge partners are in the US and Europe.
