Shit happens. i got an unrequested password reset email (along with 2fa prompts) - and another saying that my password had been changed, the coinbase app also signed itself out (never happned before). but went back to the real coinbase website, and all my btc was still there. then i re-reset my password. strange.

Why are they trying to claim $BCC as their own? $BCC is bitconnectcoin! Downvote the crap out of that bot!
