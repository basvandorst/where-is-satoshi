I’ve only been around since end of 2016 but I find these threads are a good gauge of where we’re heading.  I’m glad a lot of people are saying take profits and use stops cause whenever threads are dominated by “Cant shake me out I’ll ride to a 1$” we end up dropping huge and noobs dump ultra low.

It’s less anonymous than cash as the tx is recorded forever and one day those wallets may be linked through analysis. Hence the need for anon. coins until privacy is increased on btc.

This. You’ll only see traders do alts-tether-btc when there’s more liquidity with the alt/tether pair but that hasn’t been the case for a long time. Outside money isn’t buying alts as “the next bitcoin” anymore with only a few gamblers&amp;whales in the bitcoin community doing so.

Broadcasting happens fast (just see how fast your wallet sees a payment pending).  It’s waiting for blocks that’s slow. With LN you don’t wait for blocks as it’s backed by the integrity of the main chain. Also removes the need to store payments.

Definitely this.  I don't see forks doing well until after the fork and they may even see a crash depending on how bad the fork is for btc
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:16:31
This exactly.  And the more people try to force bitcoin in their direction via forks and the more they fail THE STROnGER bitcoin gets!  People think forks will be the end of bitcoin but I see nothing but positive results every attempt.  The price will take a hit when the speculators panic but long term it shows bitcoin can't be stopped, centralized, nor censored!

@_date: 2017-11-08 15:54:12
IMO it's better to hold both coins even if you  hate what 2x stands for the miners will try to pump it and they have friends with the capital to do it.  Best thing to do is hold your 2x and if they triple the price we dump on them then.  Make them pay a lot to try to push btc-core into 2nd place.  Don't sell their shitcoin to them cheap!  You could also lose out on making a 10% gain if it goes to zero but is worth the risk comparing to bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:20:25
Bitcoin is updating its technology more than any other coin in the world...it's just slow to change any consensus layer attributes because it's wreckless.  Dash tries to implement its own version of governance which was proven to be a complete sham when they remotely made changes to the whole network rofl.  Anyone that's scared of the stress test should sell now while price is ATH.  I'll be buying your coins on the dip if you wait lol.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:55:18
Hey pudgy why do you think bch has an advantage? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:24:38
Most analysts calling it a bubble just look at the market cap and see that bitcoin is now larger than major global companies like Exxon-Mobil lol.  While I feel crypto is in a massive bubble, considering garbage alt coins/ico's are worth billions with no qualified devs and no product to show for it, bitcoin IMO is not.  Time will tell!
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:29:32
It is that black and white and the FBI can easily follow the transfer of funds on the btc network.  Monero is fully anonymous if that's your thing.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:06:49
Both become a factor.  If btc takes over, then you wouldn't compare its value to a defunct system like USD but would need a diff. basis for measuring value per coin.  For bitcoin to take over the world you NEED a high amount of value per coin.  If not, how could you wire someone a billion dollars if each coin is worth a penny and you can only have 21 million pennies?
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:27:28
This is where monero comes in!  Totally immune to airdrops. Maybe it could work on top of btc via ligntning one day
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:34:20
You really should consider holding your 2x coins for a little.  If the price drops to zero then who cares, you may have missed out on a 10% gain but none of these coins seem to die.  Look at btrash. I sold right away but Ver's plunge protection team was able to hold the market up since we sold so cheaply.  This time, I'll hodl their crap 2x until they try to pump it and then I'll dump it at triple the price on them.  If it dies right away, then all that money goes back into btc anyway.  Playing slow and smart in this game seems to work best for me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:35
The fact that bch is up 35% while mass volume for btc is down is simply Ver and Jihan releasing btc to buy bch.  I'm holding out for cheap btc!
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:25:54
That's the only risk if you hold both.  Once you sell, you risk losing.  Like when bcash rose to 900$ and btc fell to 3600$ from 4.4.  I didn't sleep a wink that night because I thought btrash was going to somehow eat btc's value lol.  Hodling both from now on.  If you hate airdrops, buy XMR since it's completely immune to it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:29:58
Would need a crapload of big money moving in for that lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:17:36
Same thing happened months ago when btrash ate 1k of value from btc then plummetted back to .06... There is nothing but amazing news for btc now so let jihan and ver try to manipulate the market by dumping btc.  Hang back and let them drive the price down so you can scoop them up as cheap as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:50:36
No worries you'll find there are very dedicated communities that all support similar things but prioritize those things in diff. order.  All chains almost do the same thing but some focus on speed, others focus on decentralization and censorship etc.  Best thing to do is find as many crypto people as you can on twitter to follow to see diff. perspectives.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:31:06
So using a currency they can't easily track (USD) isn't as bad as using a fully tracked public ledger the FBI can follow? Got it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:29:07
If coins are 1$ and there are 21 million in circulation at that point, you can only transfer 21 million in wealth...Since people are seeing how revolutionary btc is, they're investing a lot of money into it.  This huge insertion of wealth drives the price up and expands bitcoins use-case in that more people can rely on it as a value store and transfer system.  Also, higher price means higher incentive to mine which means a more secure network.  Price means a lot for btc!
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:58:30
The attacks will never stop.  Just need to zoom out and buy dips.  The only way btc will die is if the devs and users do what the miners do and just abandon it lol. Lata bitmain, cya again in a few weeks when you're done dumping bch on the noobs you swindled.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:20:23
Do what you think is best.  Bch is a scam coin with heavy maninpulation so you're getting in way after Jihan and Ver just make sure you get out before them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:18:37
"Inferior techbology propped up by hype driven FOMO investors." You  just defined bch lol...I'm all for doubling the block size to 2mb to ease congestion but pulling a bch where 8mb blocks can be filled is silly.  Any decent dev can tell you linear scaling isn't a solution.

Especially with the flaw we're seeing now with bitcoin.  By airdropping users with bch they instantly had one of the most widely held coins.  Now they're looking to take control of bitcoin and it may very well work since everyone wants to make more money lol. Monero is immune to this since a richlist can't be built and no airdrop can be done.  Makes me really think monero is the future.

I didn't say they couldn't be built but that they couldn't copy CORE'S code to implement them.  This is bch's major flaw IMO since their dev team isn't even remotely close to the caliber of the CORE team from looking at ftrader's work compared to the likes of ChainCode Labs etc.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:38:18

@_date: 2017-11-14 18:41:35
I disagree.  Look at the ICOs that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and can't build a dev team.  Blockchain has only recently become the coolest tech. on the block but the CORE devs have been in this game for almost a decade.  Maybe in a couple years the dev pool will be big enough for projects to recruit but for now it's shallow.

Look at Quadriga.  The CEO died and everyone’s money is now “lost”.  Do some research, buy a ledger directly from ledger and not a 3rd party, write down 2 copies of the wallets 24 word seed amd keep one hidden well in your home and one in a safe deposit box.  Hide your ledger and add the feature to defend against a 5$ wrench attackz You’ll know what that means when you’ve researched enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:12:35
To your point, there's definitely a huge market that hasn't entered into crypto yet.  However, most fall way short on the promises they make (like IOTA, dash, ripple, etc).  In what other space can you put out an idea with no developers behind it and no guarantee it will work and instantly be controlling a billion dollar enterprise? Too much growth to fast for alts reminds me of pets.com
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:59:07
My point is I got in at a local all time high and held through a 50% drop in 6 hours when people were actually questioning its future.  If you have a low time preference for your money I think now is a great time to average in based on its outlook but we’ll see. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:16:17
If you think we reached the peak user base I think you’re way wrong. Also, we agree this time is completely different lol my whole post is about that.  Last year’s crashes were from people doubting its future.  This year it’s from people going in with short time preferences hoping to get rich.  Very diff. and very good for people here long term looking to accumulate.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:35:56

Find a low hashpower chain (95% of all chains) with a semi decent order book.  Make sure the mining algo is offered by nicehash. Accumulate a bunch of coins over time to not spike price.  Withdraw all coins off exchange.  Next day, send all coins back and dump as soon as they're confirmed by the exchange. Immediately withdraw your xmr/btc and once you've recieved those you begin mining at the block on the chain just before the block that has your transaction to the exchange in it.  Rent a lot of mining power on nicehash and resend the transaction to a new address instead of to the exchange.  If you outpace the network your chain becomes longest and your original tx to the exchange never happened.  The Eth Classic attack was apparently a good money maker since it was done through mostly rentable mining and didn't take more than a few hours to accomplish.

4x weight rule?  That rule gets overridden by BTC1's repo. where they adjust the base block size to 2mb thus doubling the whole equation from bip141.  You'll also see the max limit is set to 8mb allowing for them to softfork to it at a later date instead of requiring a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:33:50

I think it could easily be superior to ETH.  Solidity is a joke and many products written in it, even by competent devs, get hacked.

@_date: 2017-09-24 13:43:13
Hey guys I figured I'd explain the tech. side since many comments in here are addressing similar but different things.  Segwit increased "block weight" which was a cool way of leaving "block size" at 1mb but increased the tx capacity to do what increasing the block size would have done.  Seg2x then will increase the "block size" to 2mb thus doubling the tx capacity on the network.  I personally am against 2x due to the way they've made upgrading to 8mb blocks one soft-fork away if 2x gets enabled.  8mb blocks would offer many advantages to miners and businesses but would absolutely hurt node decentralization, miner competition, and promote spv mining.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:17:09
How'd that go for you?  Congrats on buying higher
@_date: 2017-09-24 13:35:00
What the Op is touching on is that the max blocksize can be increased to 8mb via a softfork after this 2x hardfork.  Essentially if the miners get their way on 2x they could just softfork upto to 8mb later.  That's the reason many are against.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:07:10

Anyone investing in bch simply does not understand how blockchain works.  Blockchain tech. is only better than a bank if it can't be censored, robbed, etc.  All of the bch mining is anonymous and could easily be one group. People are literally trusting their money with a stranger considering they could hardfork without notice to change the rules and flat out steal everyone's money or give themselves a million coins for fee etc.  I'd rather trust my money with Chase Bank than a stranger in the shadows lol

The solution is second layer scaling.  If you want on-chain scaling there are only a couple things to do.  Increase blocksize and schnorr sigs.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:35
It's far safer to bank with Chase than with bitcoin cash lol.  Why trust Roger Ver and Jihan Wu to safeguard your money in a system that is rigged to depreciate on EDA every so often from miners cashing out.  Bch should be FUBU (For Us By US) from a miners perspective.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:46:35
More miners support bcash when it suits them (whenever they exploit bch's EDA to nearly instamine blocks for a few days).  Then when that ends they cash out bch for btc and all go right back to btc.  B2x doesn't solve the scalability problem since it's a linear quick fix to address a problem that doesn't currently exist (mempool is very light right now).  It's really just a hope to fire CORE which is mainly comprised of volunteer devs that are leaders in their field.    Bitcoin gets stronger after each attack and this fork is just that!

Same here.  Thank god I added more btc to replace it lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:13:30
As of now yes but this is a recent thing.  Now we just need exchanges and the NYA businesses to adopt and we're good to go.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:39:49
This explains why the price is so volatile.  You have "reh-tards" buying and selling on reeetoddded shower thoughts.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:06:34
Yea just don't do it with your whole stash.  People were doing this when btc was at 2800 over summer then watched as it shot to 3350 in about 12 minutes one night.  They lost out on major gains for a few bucks here and there.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:27:39
Cause it's their shot at weakening CORE and controlling btc.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:38:43
Be careful about "diversifying" in crypto.  Diversifying in alts isn't really diversifying your funds for safety against losses considering they all tank when bitcoin tanks.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:50:57
I don't think people realize how ugly this fork is going to be.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:09:15
I disagree.  Bitcoin is way more secure and fraud proof.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:10:08
Il buy under 4.5...might be disappointed

I'm glad South Korea is finally abandoning these scam artists.  After you guys pumped BCH so hard I was worried you'd never come around.  At least you got to see Ver and Jihans colors first hand...
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:43:18
There will be major fights and certainly dents in the price.  If US bans it because N Korea starts using it to sideskirt sanctions you'd see a 90% drop in price within the first day.  Less than 1% chance of happening but certainly a possibility.  My biggest recommendation is to keep 30 or more of your wealth out of btc as buying power to catch major dips to protect your original position.

1.  There are major miners and several large businesses behind 2x but CORE devs and majority of users are against it.  This contentious fork is going to be a great stress test for btc and the community as a whole but the price may dive from it for a while.
2.  Yep you can sell those coins right now on certain exchanges offering futures trading for 2x.  In my opinion, after the bcash fork I split and sold my coins right away which ended up being a mistake at 300$.  It's close now to where it was then however I sat through it hitting 900$.  Best advice, hold both coins regardless of what you believe and if the coin you dislike (2x for me) starts getting pumped you can make them pay much more to go through you by dumping them then. 
3.  Yes.  If you hold your private keys you own your coin.  People that left theirs on coinbase still havent recieved their bcash since they need coinbase to split them.

It's funny how things have changed.  Only this past July we crashed by almost 50% due to the UASF deadline and potential fork.  Now people see it as a buy opp. instead of a selling opp. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:41:35
You'd need all of the signers of the NYA to back down which isn't going to happen.  The 80% was for activating 2x.  All miners ran btc1 software which activated segwit and will autofork together to bigger blocks in november.  There will be a split and btc will come out stronger for it.  Whether it hurts the price remains to be seen.
@_date: 2018-07-28 12:33:35
I also like the part that says the price rebounded because the SEC chair restored faith in the CBOE etf. The price originally tanked because CNBC and other morons broadcasted the failed ETF as the CBOE etf everyone was waiting for.  I did love how many noobs panic sold and already lost their positions.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:37:09
If Trump thinks N.Korea is using btc to sideskirt sanctions I could definitely see a ban on crypto in the states.  Price would drop well under $1000 in a matter of a day.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:56:39
Combine that with how overbought we'll be over the week and we'll probably see a letter from Jihan prepping for war just to get cheap coins...
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:33:47
I think most are calling for 10k...
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:26:28
Peeps will be buying btc to give as gifts
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:15:32
How'd that big dip go for you?  Congrats on buying back in at a loss...Let this go to show people that trading against principles only hoping others will do the same = loss of money.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:59:15
Almost all users are against 2x regardless of nationality.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:29:21
I think the worst part is you can clearly see the insider trades selling a couple hours before the announcement.  It's one thing to rip on scam coins, which fluffy is great at, but not to rob your own loyal followers by shorting pumps and selling hype.  I think the fact that bitcoin has no central face to its coin puts it far ahead of the competition.   I feel for whoever lost money on this but you're welcome back to bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:23:01
If the miners decide to listen to the rest of the community and refuse to hard fork for big blocks it would be great for btc...not disastrous lol everyone would be happy at that point.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:56:52
The dev deam doesn't care whether someone is "worthy" or not.  They only care if the code is "worthy".  That's why the CORE devs rock.  Everything is reviewed, viewpoints are considered, and then pros and cons are weighed.  This is all done openly and through peer review on github.  Ver and other miners would like to close this process and consolidate power as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:41:33
It would have been a semi-useful article if they compared it to the volatility of gold's value in its early days pre-NYSE
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:24:40
I agree.  I don't think anyone is concerned centralization and big blocks will beat out bitcoin lol it's just a matter of how to get the biggest bank for your buck on bcc at this point.  If it's trading over 50$ I'll offload all my bcc but any lower and I'd probably just hold it until poloniex trades it if ever.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:54:45
I agree I wish they held off until 90 days from segwit lockin as proposed though.  Now they're rushing to push out software that hasn't been tested thoroughly &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:38:24
Jesus coinbase fees are insane.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:36:24
I had a full node running on my desktop and have been in and out of monero since before it was cool.  After seeing one person is able to dent the coin so badly because he felt like sharing a personal message I've decided to leave it behind.  Luckily I bought my last batch of xmr pre-Jaxx hype so I'll do well going back to btc.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:27:38
Jratcliff is spot on.  We should all start forking bitcoin anytime we sell and it goes higher in hopes of bringing it back to us lololol
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:20:00
It increases "capacity" by .75 megabytes so adds 75% not 400%.  They're dumb for leaving just as bitcoin is ready to take steps towards lightning etc.  Good riddance!  
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:11:42
And.......you're wrong
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:12:52
Anyone else a little concerned that f2pool is an ardent supporter of 148 and luke jr as per his own tweets last month?  If he doesn't signal, btc is in for a hurting going into UASF
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:01:03
No they've already agreed to use a name that's already in use by some other coin BitConnect lol (BCC)

Bitcoin’s dominance is well over 80% if you use actual useful metrics beyond just market cap such as volume and liquidity. Great article here: 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:44:01
I love that they refer to their fork as a User Activated HARD Fork...is "miner" synonymous with "user" in China?
