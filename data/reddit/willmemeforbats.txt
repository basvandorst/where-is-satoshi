Untraceable theft, robberies, and scams will skyrocket.

“Hey that guy is using crypto!...let’s mug him and his uninsured currency.” 
Playing devils advocate, come at me.

The fastest way to destroy bitcoin is to cheer for the demise of the USD.

Ha. Thanks for seeing my concerns and not just getting offended over muh meme coins (even after claiming devil's advocate)

Also, isn't the data is only relative to it's own volume history?

If only I could tell 95% of people to "smarten up" and magically they would all understand blockchain and be ignorant and have no concerns about it.

Right, I just think the next wave of criminals will not be as dumb as criminals of the past. Companies, data, and people are already being held hostage/blackmailed unless x amount of bitcoin is sent to x address. Just happened to someone I know. There are literally companies that help others pay these criminals off because normal people don't know how.

I have read plenty of stories where this has happened and people are out tens of thousands. "don't make stupid things" . The average person is not that smart, and half of the people are even dumber than the average person. Not claiming that I am smart by any means, but the amount of people that would be immediately in extreme poverty if bitcoin replaced fiat due to human error is unsustainable and unethical.

Right, I just hear a lot of bashing of our current fiat system. Which is fine as there are obvious issues, but overall it is the equalizer and the field everyone is playing on. I think those that bash the current system are doing so primarily in hopes their bitcoin will keep appreciating at ridiculous rates (not saying it's not dank).
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:47:53
So if I can never use it for anything what makes it valuable?
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:26:16
definitely tell that one at a party sometime

This stone age version of majority rules vs the perfectly functional accountable system that currently exists though?
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:14:08
you are probably the type of person that should pay attention to posts like these btw

The salt and snark levels have risen once more.

things like this have happened\*

If an asset going from $20,000 to $3,000 in a year is the definition of "stable" then I need to give merriam-webster a call.

lmao. It's this sort of attitude of wanting to leave 90% of humanity in the dust that will end up with the government regulating blockchain, ya ignorant biased fool.

To buy my own stuff from myself?
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:46:51
\*say im playing devil's advocate in the title...get called troll. Welcome to being brainwashed by muh appreciating internet money.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:30:11
If I have millions, and my brain shits out, those millions are gone forever unless I trusted someone else. Yay this will drive bitcoins price up because those coins are gone forever, but not so much yay for me.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:33:20
If I pay for the pizza with bitcoin, how would I keep it secret that I have bitcoin..? Nobody worth any decent amount of money in USD (not just straight cash) can be mugged in an alley and NOT get their money back (and usually can track down the criminal).
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:59:48
Human error accounts for more than just similar looking letters and numbers.

When they get power the dems will shut down blockchain faster than you can say 4 more years.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:38:54
If someone has a gun to my head and says I know you have more bitcoin, give it all to me, I am going to take his word so I don't die. A million bitcoins are not worth anything to me if i am 6 ft under.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:44:33
Stable in terms of perspective in time in which an individual lives. Though bitcoin has appreciated a lot so most invested aren't going to complain, it makes me rofl to call it more stable than USD.
