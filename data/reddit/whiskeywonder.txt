If this was supposed to cheer people up it failed. Actually if history repeats this kind of retracement 2k is gonna happen.

How exactly do you think Bitcoin will...die. Do you understand how foolish that is? It cant disappear....it can only go more viral now.

But Bitcoin tech has been bettered almost as soon as it was released. Ie Litecoin and thats continued up to now with far 'better' tech in other projects. The better tech meme is a pure noob understanding of the space.

I've heard the death of bitcoin for a few years now. This is my view. Yes im sure there will be chains that far surpass Bitcoin in the future and possibly if they get massive real world use they might surpass Bitcoin in marketcap too. BUT bitcoin is in many ways now the established Gold or real properly managed digital version of a potential world reserve currency. I believe and have done since 2012 that BTC will undermine the dollar and will probably be held by countries as a percentage of their reserves. I just dont see how thw world could reach that kind of consesus on any other crypto even if a basket of them also become very popular. 
I dont see btc as a payment solution and trying to make it isnt gonna work imo. Its digital gold and cant ever die cause if it ever drops low many will buy it right back up.

Muh plebbit teenage arrogance. Lmao

This is one of most ignorant articles ive read for a while and probably half of crypto makes this same mistake right now. So funny them saying the peso dropped and amazingly Bitcoin rose in the opposite direction. Lmao.
Exactly the same dumb stuff people are saying about alts right now cause Bitcoin is rising so everyone is saying alts are dying and not the commonsense idea that simply they are moving against Btc mostly.

Don't worry. It's over your head.

Do you have something to say about....you know....the actual point I made. Or just some fucking tedious angst depressed teen shit?

You are getting caught up with an example I gave. I won't argue for Litecoin but I think its obvious to anyone there already is better 'tech' in crypto and there has been for years now. POS starting with NXT is generally seen as Bitcoin 2.0. for example.
\*I dunno why you dismiss Bitcoin clones anyway if you argument is simply being 'better' in terms of features. Many Bitcoin clones have added various things improving on Bitcoin like Dash, like Counterparty, etc..

groan....I'm so drained but let be make a simple point. The article seems to suggest that the price of Bitcoin mooned not cause of the fact the peso dropped and so therefore of course the price would of 'increased' in line with this drop. But the article suggests that 'surprisingly' Bitcoin mooned in exactly the opposite direction. duhhh.. This is the same with people and alts cause many alts actually haven't dropped over the last few months they have just dropped when measured against Bitcoin sat value.
