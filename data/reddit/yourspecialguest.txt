But Facebook isn’t crypto. Infectious diseases aren’t analogous to crypto. Crypto is more akin to video game skins than it is to either of the things you mention. They only gain value through speculation and are mostly useless in the context of the game (or in this case, spending money on goods or services). There’s a natural cap on the value of bitcoin based on its relative demand vs that of the dollar. When a recession hit the US economy, crypto will suffer more than other assets as a result— It’s not quite the “digital gold” that people try to make it out as. There’s a reason why even the most exuberant wealth managers only suggest a 1% allocation in crypto.

I want to reach through the screen and help you but you should probably just read a macroeconomics textbook to figure out how unintuitive all of this is

You didn’t do the math: Bitcoin is insignificant in the world of finance. It is not treated as a currency. I don’t think you understand how the world or even your local economy works.

You say “the rest of us” but you refer to less than 1% of the wealth in circulation. You say “fiat is dead” and yet we live in a dollar benchmarked world.
Can I please have some of whatever you’re smoking? Sunday must be lit

I tried! Save the luck, you need it more than I do

That’s not how regulations work.
Bitcoin market cap: $145B
M2: $14T
Do the math.

Work is boring after markets close but I have to be here. Also the yield curve hasn’t inverted yet.
I see a lot of young, fundamentally misinformed people dumping their money into crypto, people who weren’t around for the Mt.Gox debacle, and I want to do my best to save them money. I’m not selling anything, I’m not shilling for anyone... but as someone now involved in a major financial institution this is how I go about giving back to society even if most people won’t listen. Some people will and they will appreciate it.
Too many people in these subs who don’t understand the basics of macroeconomics or money in general.
