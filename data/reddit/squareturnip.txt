Good point.

I really don't know whether he plans on paying taxes. That's his personal business and has nothing to do with me.

Technically not my first transaction. A friend gave me 0.5 BTC years back when it wasn't worth much. He helped me setup a phone wallet ... etc. It has sat there ever since. I still keep those recovery words safe. 
He as agreed to wait for 3 confirmations before I handover the keys. And it will be done in my lawyer's office, collecting all his ID and witnessing the sale contract ... etc.

I agree. Cash isn't really an option these days. And criminals use bank accounts too. Probably more so than bitcoin and cash.

I quizzed the guy where he got his bitcoin. He said he's a tech geek and got in early. He sounds to me like he's telling the truth. He's also okay to do the transaction at my lawyer's office.
But you never know. I just don't want any trouble.

Yes. I ordered it directly from  [ 
I will make sure it's BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:21:26
My main reason for the lawyer is to have proof where I got the BTC. In case I need it in the future for taxes ... etc. So I can prove the purchase price, and the person I obtained them from.

My plan is to print my public address. Have him scan the printed QR and send the BTC. Then I will confirm the transaction on [blockexplorer.com]( via my phone.  We've agreed on 3 confirmations.
Will that work?

I made sure I purchased it directly from Trezor.
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:04:34
Because I don't want to bring the Trezor with me. Is there a better explorer to use?
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:13:31
I can't use the Trezor on my iPhone, and I definitely do not want to bring it with me.
I don't see why there would be a security issue verifying the transaction using a third-party block explorer? Heck I could open three browser windows on my phone and verify the transaction on 3 different block explorers.

Thanks for this. All good information.
I've told the buyer that if we do the transaction it will be completed in my lawyer's office. My lawyer will create and witness a contract between us, record and verify all the buyer's details and my bitcoin receiving address, we will wait until 3 confirmations before handing over the vehicle/keys. 
Even although the lawyer cost extra $$$. I thought I may need this when it comes time to sell and pay taxes. 
So far the buyer is OK with all the above. So I suspect he is not a scammer.

I wouldn't. Unless it was cash and the serial numbers were somehow recorded.
