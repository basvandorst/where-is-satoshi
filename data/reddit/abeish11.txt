I find im much happier if i set an alert to pop when btc gos over x amount and go on about life
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:58:44
Ok that now makes more sense now. Since we have 100,000,000 in one btc.
 I thought it was 1 million in 1 btc
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:12:48
I've one question about bitcoin. If their is only 21million and they say a lot has been lost. And we only have 16million coins left in circulation.
Over the years more and more will be lost reducing the number in circulation. People say this is good but how can a global currency work if we can't keep the circulation at a minimum level.
Eventually it will be so limited and a few people will hold the last btc and each % of a bitcoin will cost so muchu won't be able to pay for anything with bitcoin for under a very large amount of price. Making the use broken.
Are we able to renew the circulation to 21million?( I no the awnser is no but maybe you can see my point)

Think first 
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:43:25
Try getting meal for two with starter and drinks for under that price in Europe. Food is cheap in America.
Edit: infact you would pay close to 40euro which is around 35pounds.
Drinks  5euro each x2
Starter 7euro X2   
Main  10euro X2
42euro 
42euro is 49dollars
