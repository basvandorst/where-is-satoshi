Something needs to be done, but fiat fees are not zero.
There are classic retail banks, where the costs are indirect and it is the value of upselling and value of your data that is resold. That is not zero costs. Even banks that provide "free" accounts are not charities. Far from that.
Then there are serious banks that work offshore and typically you pay there like 0.1% fees for transactions. 1M transfer cost there like 1K. That is the cost of sending free fiat money.
Sending money, especially bigger amounts, is simply costly. There are more and more regulations and some people have to evaluate the payments. And it is the customer who pays for that.

I have completely unrelated question.
Addresses of wallet can be derived from xpub. But does it work the other way around? So can be xpub derived from one wallet? So knowing one address might compromise all other addresses of that wallet. I hope my question is stupid and it is not possible.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:22:03
Thank you for clear answer.
So the quantum computers that should in future cause loss of privacy of BTC will be (also) able to compute xpub from address(es) or that is something completely unrelated and I am mixing 2 things together?

people and merchants with many inputs will have to pay even high triple digits for tx; that is way too much... double digits are acceptable, but not this
I am trying to do two projects with bitcoin paywall. Now it is stalling. I was told by bitcoiner to use LTC. This is capitulation. Today I asked one respected btc dev and he also said "yes, it is a problem".

I always supported btc, I was silent, I hodl for years.
I think I am not the only one here, who was against this  so NO2X supporter.
And now I know I have made a mistake. It is painful to admit it. I was manipulated. I believe absolutely there were no bad intentions, just Core beliefs. Everyone has to be free to spread the beliefs, but this one was simply wrong.
Segwit2x was better solution when we look back now and see how big potential btc had and I am ashamed I was part of the people who were against it. I think nobody expected btc to hit 20K and such massive interest. We made a mistake. We should fix it. But I am really pessimist here. I think much worse things have to happen to bitcoin.

He absolutely should not allow to be skeptical of new things because investment is not about old things. It is about new things that bring the ROI and develop new projects.

I fight for money in this world. I try to do my best. My effort has fruits and the fruits are also and maybe mostly: money.
And of course I want to use the money to have more and better opportunities. I do not care what I buy and such a thing, which is vanishing quickly.
And I want the same not just for me, but also for people I love, like family and other close people. That is the whole point of making money. So I will try to pay the best doctors for my grandma and the schooling for my kids. What is wrong with this?

If you are talking about that guy is not just generosity. I want to have people around who do not struggle. He is from 3rd world and occasionally does some jobs for me, because in 3rd world infrastructure is so fucked up, that you have to hire people even for small things because they take too much time.
I will need people in my later life and I am just trying to have good relationships (not friendships though). So it is not just generosity.
The irony is that after he saw the shit he is in and mistakes he is doing, he feels much worse and starts talking about suicide. Tbh in his case it really makes sense.
It is hard to have money. Like I technically can help him in a way to  live a good life even without noticing it on my budget. But I really have to ask myself whether it is the good thing to do. He used to be ok, he just did his mistakes and spent money to parties and whores. So now his later life is exactly what he deserves. Other people who are in shit I met and who I "helped" more were all in a way in similar situation.

Also they are part of the game theory - tragedy of commons. If there is a chance to make quick money for everyone and I do not do it, someone other will do it instead of me.

I do not feel more free the richer I am. I felt the most free as poor (but it was far from anything like freedom). But at least I could wake up and stare from window and not to bitcoin charts or having to respond to my banker.
Money brings just much more problems and responsibility.
Being freed by money is illusion. Also being rich means that one really sees the importance of money and how are we all bound together with the symbol. And that is the opposite of freedom.
I think people with debts think, that freedom is being debt free. Or that being free is not being forced to do boring job or so.
Having debts means that one plays the game of society (like if it is necessary to go to university where it is overpriced or like it is necessary to spend that much). Having boring job is again personal decision, that is maybe forced by society, but having money does not mean one is out of society. One simply plays another games in it. This is why is Ver so angry and sad person. He was expecting freedom in money. He always wanted freedom. It does not come with it.

I do not think there will be a harmony or symbiosis. At some point it will be a war.
I agree non-blockchain cryptos like byteball or iota might be interesting, but not because they do not increase in value. If they will be used they will indeed increase in value! But that increase should not affect the usability like by blockchain currencies.
I think we agree more or less, you are just writing in a weird way. But you said you are not an economist, so I was nitpicking a bit about the inflation. But you have a point otherwise.

Hopefully it is not up to anybody. But core/nullc were against segwit2x, because was not tested. So why nobody capable is making bigger blocks code if they are so much agnostic?
I do not believe that. Greg is a strong intellectual leader for the better and worse. If good coders do not propose a good code, but they keep giving us a code that is not ok from economic POV, then what? Common answer is that users have to learn how to code, but even then we will just see forks. Forks that will always have disadvantage, because BTC is branded what core is working on.
What you wrote is the theory, how bitcoin has to work. And we reached the point, where we see the failure of the approach. Devs have too much power. In a way it looks like they monopolized analogy of procedural laws of bitcoin or the bitcoin narrative.

I am long term hodler. I do businesses in bitcoins (bitcoins used as transaction for real businesses from grey economy). I even extend it now further to new niche. I sold part of my bcash.  I support the conservative approach.
Yet you are missing something. Can you stop for a while and listen or you will be giving me lectures? I do not want to start the debate who has longer dick here, but I probably transacted more bitcoins in real business than most people around. It worked perfectly and that is after all where we are now. It is a success. No doubt about it.
But success is like switching from old Ford to the Lambo. You have to adjust the driving style. I am fed up with the approach of autistic programmers with their road maps. There is reality out there. I fight with my devs all the time. I am already tired from that as hell. Small blocks were 100% right until November. Maybe they are the right solution even now. But maybe not. Is there someone even thinking this way? I seriously doubt it.
Bcash attacks or whatever it is are significant. Right now cryptosphere has the largest inflow of money ever and it might never happen again. A lot of those money flow into other alts and many of them are trying to solve the same problem which will have just one winner - the cryptocurrency.
Patience and doing things right is great. But it has limits. Things can not and should not always be 100%. That is life. The best pupils from school are losers in life.
People who switch to Litecoin or other alts will not switch back or elsewhere until one coin will be winning it all. It is absolutely crazy to recommend that.
I hope you do not take my post as personal attack, it is not meant like that. Our goal is the same. Are you and other devs able to listen? It is the devs arrogance that created the sad r/btc people who show middlefingers. Are you so much sure it does not matter?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:06

Sorry, but bitcoin value was given from the small transactions. Then they got bigger. Recommending an altcoin is absolute capitulation.
If you think that for example my business will switch back and forth then you are absolutely mistaken. Once I am being paid in altcoins it will never get back.
You clearly are a programmer. You have absolutely no experience with real economy and business. You shocked me. Do not take it personally, I am not attacking you. But if people who are doing bitcoin think like this, we have a serious problem.

Fees can take over only if price does not rise enough. After 2 halvings the ratio between fees and miner reward would be constant if we only quadruple the price. If fees have to take over, the price has to rise less than 4x. But if price rises only 4x the investors will be gone and price will actually plummet.

Can someone explain to me how can LN - even if working perfectly - cover the whole world or at least the significant rich minority?
With Segwit we have 7tx/sec, it implies 7 x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365 = 220 M tx per year. That means that if a channel is being opened and closed just once a year and each person has just one channel and there are no onchain transactions and we do not count txs of LN nodes, then even LN would cover 110M people with this math. Probably way less.
Is there some other scaling being prepared or considered? Or will people use their banks or other central points as LN hubs?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:19:52
Ok. Then show me someone, who is not doing it in this way. With Bitcoin or anything else. It is just natural. We are people. I mean yes, they indeed lie and say "we are neutral" and would tell you to fuck off, but that is the game.

I understand that it is the idea.
If you fall from boat in the middle of ocean you also do not expect that you can swim to the shore. But you keep swimming.
Altcoins in development like iota can afford to be unusable, because nobody is using them (yet). Bitcoin is the only crypto that is being used in businesses and there are a lot of people that need it. This is undermining the trust into crypto and much more into bitcoin.
Bitcoin must work even for "normal" transactions. This way the only people who can afford to pay the fees and win the bidding are the bitcoin speculators. I am using bitcoins to be paid. I pay people in bitcoins. Now I am switching to altcoins. Easier by people. Much harder for business since it brings a lot of costs. Will I switch back? Will other businesses switch back? I do not have an answer, but I would definitely advise not to gamble with it too much.

The amount of bitcoins is rising (until 2140). That is definition of inflation.

It is really hard to stay "neutral". Everyone has some agenda and those who say they have not, have the strongest one.
And I do not think bitcoin as "technical solution that allows people to do trustless transactions directly without involving a third party which can be used for all sorts of different reasons and agendas" is something neutral. There are simply agendas that want to control people from centre [I do not say they have evil intentions] and other agendas, that want to do it in the trustless way. In other words bitcoin is political. It can be praised and is praised by certain leftwingers and rightwingers and so is opposition to it.
But it is hard to say "I am for cryptocurrency" but I am politically neutral.
But maybe you thought that AA is choosing just some one of the pro-bitcoin agendas. Then I am curious which one.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:30:47
Look, no offense, but you also have a problem. And the problem emerged sooner in your life I bet.
I remember my dad dying with your words. He was complaining that the blueberry cake is not as good as it used to be etc.
I am also in my 40s, I made a fortune too, but I honestly do not have those problems. I bought a fast car now and it brings me fun. More than the 1st crappy car when I was horrible driver and had many accidents, driving drunk etc.
I travel a lot (I actually moved in the opposite of the world), not with budget 100 USD/month. I still have a lot of danger and fun, but in the end I can decide whether I sleep in 5 star hotel or some rotten place as before.
I have learnt how to love animals and I have nice cats.
I finally have some people around that are important to me and they are not dicks (yeah, they are not dicks, because they work for me, so I kicked out all dicks).
I have my x-th wife, finally real submissive slut, who loves me and I can love her.
I still do some psychedelics, I started with body exercise etc.
The list goes on, not going to jerk off in public.
But my point is that the same things you felt in 20s are possible in later age and maybe even brighter. You just have to work on it. Do not be scared to do painful changes in life. Maybe it is true one loses energy bit by bit, but at the same time the experience levels this off and you should be able to manage the energy better.
If you are not doing the energy-management, because you probably thought the things should be automatic like in 20s, you do something horribly wrong.
It is the same btw. as with meals. I always had 70 kg something with 185cm. I did not have to look what I do or what I eat. If I stop now I will be 100kg in no time. But now I know how. I know what is a good food and how to get it. I can buy it in civilized world at least. I know how to do exercise efficiently. And so on and so on. Working on soul is in this way the same as working on body. I think it is never late for you. But who knows. Maybe you already missed your train as well if there is a thing like missing trains.
Good luck, my suggestion is at least try it.

Are you asking me "how do I know"? I do not know what fees will be.
But to be precise **everyone** will never use segwit, bc it is soft fork.
Most transactions will probably never will be batched, because if they are not batched by now, then they never will be.
Other points are about so distant future, that bitcoin will simply not survive. 
I was asking about near future (my fault that I did not point it out).

Yes it is very sane to solve 0 block reward environment, when the rewards will be high enough even after many halvings. Especially if bitcoin surges.
And it is absolutely not necessary to solve recent problems, where businesses that use bitcoin hold on only because of network effect.

You absolutely do not get it. You can not somehow split bitcoin as a piece of code + network and so on on one side and bitcoin as investment instrument on the other side.
Money is nothing else than trust leverage. People put money into anything, because they trust it. And they trust more to the things that other people trust. That is network effect.
If you create the exact copy of bitcoin, it will not be bitcoin. Because there will be no people. It is the people, transacting people (or machines ok), who give life to the coin.
And right now, the regular people, who already use bitcoin as money, can not transact because they are outbid by speculators only, who can afford the fees. And that is broken.
As broken fiat created bitcoin, now broken bitcoin is giving life to altcoins. The altcoins are maybe reckless about security, but they react to needs of the market.

Where I said that? Read again what I wrote. That fees bother me does not have anything to do with spending. If I have to receive payments from my customers and if I have to collect the payments and send money back with many inputs then it kills the business.
And if the same goes for other businesses then no one will use btc, just the people speculating.
When this happens, bitcoin network effect that keeps him afloat, is gone.
I am well aware what I can or can not pick, no need to advise me. I am just invested in BTC still and I want to know whether someone cares.

Sure, and before yday was even lower...
My guys are developing/adjusting core wallet. To do a mass transaction is the simplest thing ever. Merchants are NOT cost effective for fucking long time and insisting on it is just plain dumb.
You know the joke: there are 2 economists walking on Trafalgar square. One of them sees 50 pounds on the street. He says: "hey, there is 50 quid, let's take it and have a couple of drinks". The second says: "Nah, there is not 50 quid on street. It is impossible. If there was 50 quid on this busy square, someone would have picked it already".
That is this rational and stupid logic all in one. For the same reason the segwit implementation is lagging as fuck. And LN will be even harder to implement. Because we see that some exchanges rather paid millions in fees (or forced to pay their customers) than the 50 quid to programmer that would rather implement the mass transactions.

The saying means something that you have to do a foundation from which you and your close people are able to live. He had such opp and he failed. He is not stupid so he admitted it. He was just one click close to actually be financially secure and his family as well. He failed. As 99% of people who are or were involved in bitcoin and sold cheap.
Let's be frank. This debate is about RV and AA fanboys. It is boring.  While RV is a sad and for me even disgusting person, he was not broke. AA was. Hopefully AA will take a lesson from this.
I do not underestimate how big influence money has on people. But imagine that it would be AA with the 1M bitcoins here and RV with much less. RV would not be able to finance the propaganda, shills, btc forks and so on. AA maybe would not be such an asshole.  Maybe would.
In other words: money is power. And I am kind of sick of "great people with pure heart" who somehow can not feed their family and even less their ideals, so they are dependant on gifts from others (=read it as they will be sooner or later useful idiots of someone else).

You are wrong. Nobody uses XMR and other methods even when they **seem** to be better. Why? because of network effect. The network effect is the only thing why bitcoin is still alive. The network effect is what holds bitcoin afloat. And how long will it last? God knows.
I do not have patience. There are sportsbooks that have helped bitcoin so much in adoption, but you do not want to see it. They stopped now because of network congestion. I spank my devs with bamboo stick, but here I am good for nothing. You think too highly about bitcoin and that the money can not be aimed elsewhere. Coinbase accounts are mostly fake and unfunded, at least that is so fucking obvious, but from those funded can be bought any other altcoin. Once the 50 usd investors see that they can not send the money they will either not reinvest or turn to something else. To where they already look at because they are greedy ofc.
If I have to hodl, then what you wrote is exactly what drives me to altcoins. Believe me. Again, this is not personal. After all, my bamboo stick is working with love as well. You do not see forest because of the trees. Now this is really just a bet on the brand and network effect that bitcoin will last until LN. Terrible. And more terrible, because I am sure all other core devs think more or less the same as you.
But no problem, evolution will resolve it somehow.
And if we somehow make it through, let's say in 3 years, you have a beer from me and my apology.

So even with 6+ or 100 confirmations you think you do not get your 100%? It is true, you get only 99.99999..999%
But you never get 100% in crypto. Your private key or seed also is never 100% secure.

It is called price elasticity.
If we think that now there is a capacity for 3tx/sec (it is more, but just let' assume it). And let's assume there is demand for 4tx/sec.
Then there is a war whose tx will be confirmed and price skyrockets.
But if you double capacity to 6tx/sec, there will be unused capacities and price would be driven down.
Exactly like by oil, where the need of world for oil is pretty much stable and fluctuations by few % caused the rise above 100 USD/barrel and then drop under 30 USD/barrel. The oild output did not fluctuate by more than half or so. Not even close.

It is a false dilemma between altruism and "egoism" that she is coming with. Indeed what she calls altruism is bs and hideout of weak people.
But look objectively at America. It is a mess. It is more socialistic now than it was before and it is because of her ideas as well.
She fled from USSR and now the people like Snowden escape to Russia. USA is the powerful mad Big Brother of this planet. It has nothing to do with freedom in any way. The East Coast mindset is gone.

@_date: 2017-12-27 13:49:23
I guess this has to prove superiority of BTC. But I did not realize that BCH has 10% of BTC transactions which is an alarming growth. There is nothing to celebrate.
Even when we consider that BTC will have much more batch payments (so under one tx will be more payments), much more offchain payments and many BCH payments are probably just tests without economic significance. 
I am not a bcash fan, sold part of my airdrop, but BCH seems to be a succesful coin so far at least in terms of real use. If we look at other and older alts, they have much less transactions.

His videos are great, he is probably a great personality, but calling "his success" to anybody who is involved in bitcoin from early stages and somehow had no 5 minutes to spare pocket change or was not believing in bitcoin enough to hodl is a bit too much.
AA financial life is a failure. And that failure brings other problem into life. Thank god it is resolved with the donors.

I have altcoins, indeed. And my main focus is either on those which might have network effect and are far from bitcoin. Because if Bitcoin fails, we need something very different.
Either way it is not just about the code. It is about timing as well. It is just ridiculous to make the same decisions under any conditions. If we were now at sub 1K price, there would be 10x less people, Mempool ok, then indeed no scaling would be necessary. But things change, in cryptoworld rapidly. The devs do not give a fuck it really seems. This is why companies have project managers. They force devs to react to reality. 
Maybe before I finish this the price of bitcoin will crash sub 1K, so everything wil be ok until next halving. Window of opportunity is closing. But if not enough people will be in crypto fast, even greater window will close. Politicians will come with regulations and they would regulate much less if much more people would be already converted.

If someone things that people who have bitcoins (and where 90%+ of people keep them on exchanges) will do this, then he is absolutely mistaken. And that is why the progress of Segwit is shit.

Great. Thank you.
PS. I remember I have read something about war and enemies. That everyone might have enemies, who will fear and fight, but will not hate them to the bone. Or one can choose enemies and will hate them from the depth of his heart.

Will this be fucking finally adult conversation, or is this just shouting about AXA vs Bitcoin CEO?
Each day, more and more, I am out. I still hodl my few thousands bitcoins, but now buying just alts. Yday some dev, maybe bitcoin core dev told me, that my money do not matter and that people who want to transact have to use Litecoin. And that approach is exactly the scorched earth.

People are social creatures. Just the society forces them to do the decisions. Personal responsibility is something rare, probably wanted, but for most non-existent.
Take bitcoin: I talk about it all the time. People just listen, say it is nice. I talked to my bankers, they thought it is some toy for millionaires, since they saw my balances. I offered payment to my physioterapeut, he was looking at me like that I want to rob him. I talked about it in tea room..the same. And now, suddenly, they all ask me about btc.
Personal responsibility? Did they suddenly get it? No. They were just manipulated by media. All of them. People generally do not use brain independently. Independence is rare and costly. Just reading social media makes anyone dependent and irresponsible, because we, as mammals, are destined to follow the horde.
Certainly exceptions happen, but it means that one has to go against his own nature.
So yes, people who are not aware of this and who do not actively fight with this are manipulated and forced what the others want. I am originally from marketing and marketing is such a game. You just force people into what you want them to be thinking about. Stupid tricks. They work over and over again even to the most rational people. Everyone has a weak spot. Most people are all weak.

No, banks lent money at any interest rates. that is the purpose of banks. Does not matter if money is cheap or expensive. But if the money is cheap = there are low interest rates, they lent it recklessly and they do not look for high ROI projects, because they do not need to make big money to pay off interests. So they can afford to invest into shit projects. That is the difference. And that is the reason why bitcoin was created. That is why bitcoin has success. That is why in the genesis block is written: "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".

Money stored in the banks do not just sit there. They are lent to other people who invest to the factories. Or at least it should be like that and it was like that until states did not start to play on higher level with monetary policy.
Today it is perverse. People are putting incentives not to save money, but to spend. But the money are not missing still. Magic? No. The money is created out of thin air. So the macro balance is achieved.
However we miss the microbalance. The money that would be normally provided by people through banks or other channels are now provided by governments. It is a kind of banking socialism. There is much less control where we put the money. Because it is not about revenue anymore. When things go ugly, we just create more money. The microeconomic imbalances just grow silently. Almost everyone pretends there is no problem. The people who do not pretend it, can not do much. We are waiting until this shit implodes.
People tolerate it, because it is convenient. It went too far to do some gradual changes. So we all wait for a collapse. After that people will start to save again as average bitcoiner.

I am also not BCH shill and I agree with OP.

Some core people are arrogant pricks, on avg great coders, I do not trust they can understood economy much and even less psychology and human relationships (but we all have to learn a lot).
However I think the backlog now should clean. We see congestion that follows the price surge. Plus there is congestion caused by the forks and I think this is even more important. All people must move coins to new wallets to be able to claim BCH (I bet most do not have claimed yet), BTG and now many new shitforks. If we count all funded addresses, it is several million txs!

I understood the argument that the changes have to be gradual (even if they were false), but now it was enough time to do the tests, was not it?

The same thing makes Bitcoin vulnerable. There are people out there. Common people that right now are losing fear of cryptos and they want to own it and transact with it.
Since I have 80% or so in BTC still and sold some bcash, it implies I am betting on LN as well. But I am seriously thinking I am trusting it too much. Especially with the lax approach of Bitcoin devs who care just about the code (it seems) and not about the people. Life and business is about compromises. Having Bitcoin unusable exactly now during the spike of value and interest is more than horrible. Yes, it is clogged because of the interest, but it does not change anything. It just shows it was too near to the limit even before and not ready for recent public interest.

It is not ad hominem. I just exactly quote Adam Curtis and how she lived in late stages after she fucked (literally) even with her closest people claiming she was superior (she probably was, but that is exactly the problem with her approach). But yeah, I read Fountainhead, not Atlas. &lt;here is start of my personal opinion&gt;It was indeed an interesting read. Like a good fairy-tale. &lt;/end&gt;
I of course know that she is one the the most influential writers of 20th century. Probably right after Mao ZeDong. And that is the problem. Too many Americans believe in that ideology literally. After reading the book I understood much more to people from the USA.
The perception that the rich people who of course have better skills and are superior can neglect the poor is absolutely false. If the better skilled or talented people (like her without doubts) neglect the others, the misery will take over. I do not like it as well. But this is how world works.
She really died alone collecting stamps. Her inspiration somehow did not help, because we see surges of socialism everywhere. After all Greenspan as her very close friend started the banking socialism with the extreme monetary policy that even him did not believe in.

I always hear this. I do not get how mining has to be less profitable if price has to rise.
And if price does not rise, then bitcoin does not attract new crypto investors. If there are no new cryptoinvestors, then they go elsewhere. If they go elsewhere, the network effect is shifting...
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:51:40

If you assume that resources are unlimited you are coming with completely new idea that nobody agreed yet about. The right-wingers say that economics is about fierce competition of individuals. Left-wingers have a clash of classes. Maybe money for you are unlimited, but that is just because you are the privileged one and you are not spoiled.
But sources are limited. I live in 3rd world country and I can tell you. There is not enough sources for people to live even the West-middle-class standard. And people aim even higher.
Also there are national states where the poorer and poor from the rich states, who are still very rich in terms of the world, who simply refuse to share the wealth amassed by their countries.
People are simply divided, they compete and sources are limited. I have amassed fortune as well. I can make nice living to few thousand people. Will I do it deliberately? Hell no, especially after I see how lazy the rest of people is. I will rather make happy my own family and my cats and defend my wealth against intruders.

So? World is, was and will always be about power. People, institutions and states concentrate power to have... power. Once you have it, you use it and abuse it.
Of course many nice documents, laws, constitutions are written, but that is always just a cover up to the real situation which is that everything is about power.
I absolutely hate what US are doing. Because I am not from USA and therefore I do not participate on it and it involves me on personal level as well. But I understand what they are doing. They can not leave the power on sidewalk, even if they were so stupid. Someone else would pick it up.
Solution is not to ask for more fair behavior. Solution is that everyone will start to accept the reality and demand less guarantees, not more. Because all guarantees and political decisions are here just to give people a fake security and fake hope.
USA abuse the power in the way you describe it and everyone should accept that. I talked to the bankers you mention and they accept it, because that is life. The more people accept the situation the more they will be ready to work with bitcoin (which is btw. a direct consequence and counterattack against the power abuse). Wasting time with pointing out the obvious is the worst thing that people can do.

Your argument is even weaker. To implement batch transactions for example for exchanges is a piece of cake. It would already save them a lot even before. It is not done, because they are simply not cost-rational (no idea whether they are just irrational or there is too much VC around so they do not give a fuck). And because they are not cost-rational it is just a gamble that they will implement it now.

I think this is the tax of decentralized kind of work on bitcoin. Now we see the disadvantages.
Lightning would be perfect, but yesterday was late.
We have Segwit, it might have helped. But from what I understood it is not even implemented into Core wallet. Probably the most used SPV wallet Electrum does not have usable Segwit as well. What the fuck is this? Make it usable or... errr... make the fucking 2MB blocks.
It seems everyone from Core is broke, so the purists do not give a fuck, but there are actually BTC Core supporters who are invested in Bitcoin. And there are really people who want to have business based on Bitcoin. Not on development of the code, but to be able to transact with it. It seems nobody gives a fuck.
Now we can just prey that something good happens with mempool over Christmas. But this is fail.
Meanwhile if you look into r/btc there are not just lunatics as before. People flee to alts. The alts are not yet used for transactions amazingly, but once this happens, good bye BTC. I still hodl.

Sorry, but people who hodl took a fucking lot of risks. I hodl, I have thousands of coins, but I had to make money for them upfront and then I had to be so crazy to invest real money. The money were made with my work as well. And I paid for that with my health and also broken relationships. Yes, it was my decision and no regrets.
However to think that people who are in bitcoin from early stages and were not able to resist and kept hodling something they invested maybe few hundreds are somehow risking more is crazy.
I never cashed out single net bitcoin. When I did, I always bought more, even at 10K+.
You should not be self-sacrificing that much and expect people to respect you and Andreas said he made a mistake and he is a great person to be able to express his mistake in public.

History shows that majority of people always want to follow. They always unconsciously seek for the authority figures.
While I really do not like this human side, it is important to admit that it exists. To deny it causes even bigger problems than the fact that people are simply "sheeps" that want to follow some proxy leader, who afterwards has a lot of power and then abuses that power.
Bitcoin itself shows that too much democracy evolves into the "politics". It is getting centralised on all levels (miners, exchanges, ideas). 
I think that trying to avoid politics is like pissing against the wind. Bitcoin is already being swallowed by capitalism - by something it was against from the beginning. Now it will be a play of political figures. As everthing that matters for humans. It is ok. Bitcoin is after all part of the human world. All revolutions end like that. The big ideas think they change everything, but after all they "only" have an influence.

My original proposal was meant exactly in this way. Afterall future downsize of the blocks, after it will be revealed it is a nonsense, is possible right?

The analogy with gold is interesting, because I think that is exactly the case. The transaction costs for 1gram of gold are incredibly high. You have to find a broker, which cost you a lot of time which is fixed for 1gram or kg (and time is money) and the 1gram of gold is traded 10s of % higher than pre gold (1gram now is like 50 USD, 1kg is 39,000 USD, so the premium is like 25%).

I am not sure if it is possible to cover 100% of cases.
For now there is a spam that simply does tens of thousands transactions from the same address to the same address. Those can easily be spotted as unwanted.
But for the rest it is up to the debate. I can imagine that funded address without certain amounts confirmations should use progressively higher fees to send bitcoins for example. Maybe it is a dumb idea, certainly someone will have a better one.

I was never fat, I just started and stopped. But people who work for me are the computer geeks. So most of them fat. I am trying to do something for them/with them.
What works for those guys, not always, but with many relapses:
1. set the goals really really low, best is to forget about goals
2. drink a lot of water
3. buy fitbit or something like that and try to scrape as much steps as possible, it really counts even 10 more minutes walking
4. remember point 1.
It is far from over, it is good to add yoga or something like that. But the points change something with the body and taste, so even there should be not such an urgency to eat junk food. It is always there and do not try to battle with it, if it comes, mind is fragile. But if you are at the point like: I might get it, but maybe something else would not be that bad, try the other alternative.

At least someone with brain here.
I think the society now is more complicated. There are the rich who could afford the healthcare, but could not afford good guards. And there are the ultra-rich, who can. It would make sense to kill the ultrarich, but they are in power always and they are also the smartest.
Look, I made it from the really poor guy in really poor country to UHNWI. From what I saw the situation is complex. When I was poor I felt the compassion. Then I felt the opposite. Now I do not feel anything but karma of everybody. I do not know what is right or wrong. I only think that the game theory here applies. The most successful countries **right now** - and here does not make sense whether it is US or Western Europe, are the ones that somehow make the consensus. In the US there is paid health care, but the bankruptcies are not so harsh, so it kinda levels off and there is still strong social consensus in all 1st world countries (and those countries are 1st world right because there is the consensus, even when it is far from idyllic).
But it does not matter much for future, because then comes Bitcoin and all. This consensus will be broken with anonymous money. Tax income will go down and states will be weaker (not only because of taxes). Then the power forcing people to consensus will not exist anymore. Just the Kant will remain and let we see how strong it is. I can tell you from 3rd world countries with weak states that people can still live on level of animals.

And no, it does not make sense. Especially not the propaganda about life threatening situations. I am not advocate of paid health care. But to swallow the propaganda where anything except intensive care is not life threatening is false bullshit by governments.
I know people waiting for artificial joints for 2-3 years. The waiting itself is threatening the health and if the health is hit, then it is threatening the life. There are a lot of people who are waiting for the surgery of hip joints without proper movement. And the movement itself is the basic healing procedure and something everyone needs to do to stay healthy. 
Why everything must be so black and white like the debate about blocks? World is not black or white.

That is a completely different story. Spam is spam and can be paid and is always paid in some way.
And we definitely should care about the bitcoin network, where the intention is to send money and not to restrict sending money. There is no reason why the code should be neutral to all transactions in a way that "the spam" is allowed.
There are certainly ways to limit "the spam" with asymmetric fees and they might be either applied or at least the threat of those steps might work even without changing the code.

I think freebies on national level (not father to son) are necessary, but it is not that idyllic. It happens simply because the society is more stable like this.

I even agree that Bannon is fascist, to make it short (even when it is a great shortcut, but political life somehow is a battle between fascism and socialism). But how is it relevant to bitcoin. Is everything that fascist irrelevant just because they are fascists? Bannon is a person with power, so it is relevant. Especially because fascism is going to win the next round, after this wave of socialism will be depleted. Bitcoin - as free money - will never be helped by socialists. Bitcoin is creating even stricter elite and does not allow redistribution through taxes.

The wealthy go after ROI. Indeed they have it in assets. But when the assets do not bring high ROI they want to switch. Nowadays there is a threat of negative interest rates again on table.
Small people already do not have a surplus, they start in minus with loans from the beginning. The 99% do not have any free assets at all. If they scrape something here or there, they almost always instantly sell after 100% appreciation, because they (think they) need the money. And they miss 1000% or 10000%.

Well life as zero sum game was a shortcut. Life or universe or existence in fact has to be a negative sum game. There is a "commission" paid to any activity. That commission is called entropy.
But indeed what is life/existence or whatever is (positive or negative sum game) "just a" belief or in other words a mythology. And those mythologies and their owners compete in life like selfish genes. So the most vital theory will in the end defeat the others, because people who believe in it will behave according to it and will have some advantage in long term.


Absolutely yes and absolutely no :) If you want general answer, it is as I wrote it above. But that is bullshit as well. I can say "anything is possible" and that is certainly the only 100% accurate answer in this universe. It is also the most cowardish answer. One must believe in something and what I see in people of 21st century is they want to be always right and that is contradiction. You can either strongly believe and risk you are wrong or you can be always right but then the life is bleak. So my choice is risking that I am wrong, I do not give a fuck and god loves me. So for bitcoin/crypto: once this transformation will be done, there will be no theft, because the concept of thievery will not exist (as you can not hack the seed for example by bruteforce [if you do it is not a hack, but poor security], or 51% attack is not a theft as well [I guess the old system will try to define it as a theft, but as time will go on it will vanish]). Just mistakes will exist and people will pay for them. The revolution is that people will bear total (or much more) responsibility.

If you want proper explanation, maybe start to take LSD or read Joseph Campbell. Or best, try to get out of box, which is impossible in society.
I would like to explain to you what you asked for, but it is really hard for me, because I do not know you. I do not know what you know about mythology. Is it a fairy-tale for you? Or total nonsense? Or are you familiar with the modern theories of myths, e.g. why they exist, how they emerge and so on (that is my basis)?
But ok, in other words. One has to take care of himself. Even totally "altruistic" buddhists, even Mother Teresa said such things. 1st care about yourself, then your family, then help to the rest of the world around you with all your power. But if you are helping yourself, it is a zero sum game. Your gain is a loss for someone or something else. This is how the world works. You can close your eyes and ignore it. Or you can be like the oriental asceticists, who try to avoid any harm to the extreme, yet they still do some harm. So one lives and does harm (or what he perceives as harm). Maybe you saw Trigun anime?
Karma is something that comes from those moral dilemmas and it is a concept that evolved because it caused a stabilised society and also it gave peace to the people who believed in karma. Still it is a mental concept and as such, it is flexible. You can believe in Karma, Gandhi and Hitler were also believing in it. I believe in it. The results are probably way different.

I have never been in the USA so I know where the world is.
Wealth of normal people is known. In the USA 1% owns the 40%. In other countries the gini coefficient is sometimes bigger sometimes smaller. So roughly half of all world assets is owned by 1%. But there is more. This half of the wealthy can be nearly all invested, because they already have houses, cars and food cost nothing to them. They are the only one with free money to invest. The 99% of people might own the other half, but they must cover all their housing, all the loans and mortgages. So from the other half of human wealth much much less can be invested. You can read about marginal propensity to consume and marginal propensity to save. The amounts that the rich and poor have in absolute numbers are incomparable.

I absolutely agree that we had no other choice so it did not crash. And if it happens again, the system will try anything to survive. After all what happened in 2008/9 was not that crazy. The next crash will show more crazy things.
BTC can be either safe haven for hodlers or maybe the savior. If it will be a savior, then the economy will be much more harsh for everyone. Social nets will be destroyed. But either way btc is a safe bet then.
The paradox is that btc is also a good investment for good times (or muddling through rather like now).
So what has higher probability: some unseen software or corporate governance error in btc that can not be repaired [which is very unlikely]; even if error is found there would be a fix and rollback and market would swallow it
or the (2008/9)^2 ?
I bet for the second option. Different kinds of debts are accumulating in economies. Something will be toxic sooner or later.
Also I work in real economy and I think corporations are less and less effective and there is chaos everywhere. Microeconomy goes to shit. Maybe it is the effect of fiat creation and disrupting the scarcity  on markets, but maybe it goes beyond that.
But I simply see bitcoin or some crypto as the most stable part of economy.

Taxes are maybe a good thing, but people avoid paying it. I think taxes are maybe partially a good thing for society, but I avoid it. Most of other people and especially the ones with money do the same. You can think taxes are great for society and yet you avoid paying them. Tragedy of the commons.
And cryptos are used for tax evasion and people who get rich with cryptos evade paying taxes. Most of bitcoins are not owed by US citizens and outside of US there are legal ways or states do not care that much.

Taxi drivers maybe do not pay taxes, but the licence fees are crazy.

Roger will not make anything else than Liberland 2.0. But I think he will be sadly kidnapped and killed before that as soon as people specializing on extortions realize that there is a billionaire with Swiss bank in his pocket. I hope I am wrong, but this is just matter of time.
I meant if cryptos are adopted into the point where b2b accept cryptos, then it will be cryptooffshore space. For the purpose of low taxes. The people who bitch about taxes usually sit at universities or are middle class kids. Both of them get fucking lot from public goods and externalities, but they are too dumb to recognize it.

Yes. So maybe it just signalizes that we need bitcoin more than the UK electricity. Which itself is the most alarming thing: I mean the fact that regulations of money went so far, that we pay more than electricity of one nation to get access to free money. But UK is maybe 1% of human population. Wild guess 2-3% of energy consumptiion. Nations pay roughly 2-3% to defense. And most of costs of society are not for food or living, but payments for social coherence. It just feels weird, but it is not weird at all.
Also if we ever are at 100K I think you neglected:
1. Halving effects
2. Chip efficiency
3. Bitcoins can be mined anywhere, so even at places where energy can be produced, but it is not, because there are no people and energy transmission costs are too high. So: Siberia/Central Asia with solar, hydro and fossil powers, desserts and solar power and geothermal energy where it is possible. Maybe it will trigger development of further power plants.
Remember flying to the moon or big wars. It was also wasting of energy. But ended up with new inventions.

With Bitcoin it is a different level and it is not yet almost priced in. Bitcoin is **much** more deflationary than gold (and thus much better store of value), because it has limit of supply where nobody can go over it. Gold had big inflationary times when Spain conquered the New World and raised supply of gold. This will not happen with bitcoin.

You are asking the right question here. But after you will spend too much time in crypto area, you will start to believe that wash trading is here to move prices.
The reality is that there are too many cryptos around. And people love only those cryptos, which ones they own. If the other coins go up more than their favourite coins, they always come with some crazy bullshits instead of just thinking that the price goes up, because buying side is stronger than selling.

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:52:55
Yes, they earn it. But how? State is producing in some countries way over 50% of GDP. Everywhere is far the biggest player and employee. This (and many other subsidizing and redistributing things) are happening because fiat exists. Once fiat ceases to exist state will have hard time for example during crisis to hold aggregate demand because it will print money for state employees.
And then the *earnings* will start to fall. And that is  just the beginning. And that is just one example how fiat is being (mis)used.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:05:51
Absolutely wrong. There will never be 160 people hodling 100K bitcoins. Sooner or later the first would sell and there would be effective supply of 100K bitcoins. And that supply would set the price.

What is so special (in a bad way) on fossil fuels? Why hydro is called pure? 
One of valleys I liked when I was small is now becoming a hydro dam. Is the dam better or worse than "destroying" the carbohydrates from some stone no one cared about before and after nuclear fission nobody will care about?
Even if the dam is better, then how you persuade **everybody** that we have to go with the "clean" bitcoins? If there is just one miner, who can use the "dirty" way of mining, he will. Please keep in mind that the more people you persuade to go to the clean way of mining, the cheaper he will have the fossil fuels, the higher will be his revenue and the bigger will be his market share.

Then I guess the people who are estimating the power consumption at 100K must be cooking numbers. Hashrate and price are strongly correlated. With more efficient chips, the hashrate and price will go up, but energy consumption not that much. Bigger part of costs of mining will be the intellectual property associated with miners.
People maybe do not agree that something is worth of their money. They will agree that everything is too costly if you ask them. But what is important is if they pay it. And yes, people pay for the bitcoin and even at those high prices they do not flip. I pay over 100 CHF to my bank for my wires. I bitch that it is too much, but yeah in fact... I am very happy with them because they still process all my payments unlike the joke retail banks with 0 fees and bullshits over and over again.

Yeah, you are poor because the effective taxation is extremely low. I have a house in Brazil as well, so I can tell.
The problem of Brazil is that the taxes are high, but stolen by politicians on much greater level than elsewhere.
Also in Brazil small businesses do not pay taxes at all. I asked my friends like car repair service and so on and nobody pays income taxes. (I do not say people do not pay taxes at all: they pay a lot in direct taxes like IPVA.)
Problem why Brazil is completely fucked up and will be much more in future is that the culture somehow can not handle so big money that come from taxes.
I agree that solution for Latam is the way of Paraguay. To be and stay poorer, but at least honest. But at this point, after politicians gave so much fake hope to poor, it is impossible. Brazil will end like Venezuela.

I am by coincidence a macroeconomist (I have MA in it, but I do other things).
It is more complicated. What you say is just one theory. It is the mainstream theory and it is reflecting also our economics. (Mostly. Japan in last 30 years is not an inflationary economics; again by coincidence I am in Japan right now and mainstream economists say it is a disaster but what I see is the most advanced nation I have seen so far.) The theory or approach you quote is called neoclassical synthesis. It is the mainstream.
But there are other theories around. Some of them (mostly from right wingers) say that money is neutral, at least in the long term. You can see some hardcore libertarians quoting Austrian school here sometimes for example.
The truth is that everything is just theories and we are testing it in real time which is exciting.
I think that fiat and low inflation is good for the social-welfare state. For the economics and society we know. But it is not that good for accumulation of capital (for more reasons that I will not say now). I think it is certain that **if** bitcoin or other deflationary crypto succeeds it will be a disaster for the economy we live in. In short: much more inequality will happen, because much less redistribution will be possible (inflation is one redistribution channel; taxes are second).
Either way the most important here is why you think that money that people want most is the kind of money that is the best for economy. Even if we have consensus what is the best for economy and society (we do not have the consensus by far) then the money that will be used in the economy can be the kind that is not suitable for the economy. People that follow their self interest - by money the money holders want of course money that will not lose the value - can push through different money that the optimal ones.
Until now money were created by states. And state could say we want inflationary money, because it is good for economy and citizens. It was not money created by free market.
Now the money is created in free crypto market. Holders will get rid of inflationary money and they will buy deflationary.
So I think we should expect deflationary crypto being the reserve currency **even when it is not good for economy**.

I like POS too and I believe bitcoin will fork into POS or POsomething in the end. However it is not so dramatic.
All economics of the world are vastly inefficient. Pure socialist economics created and spent so much energy on nonsense for decades.
And current "capitalism" is just creating things no one really wants to use. People just buy stuff and not use it.
I always imagine Darvaza gas crater or volcanoes of the world and the energy "vasted". Or some moons full of carbohydrates in Solar system and their unused potential.
The energy is not vasted. It is used. And maybe much better than alternatives. What should we do with the energy we produce? Going more by cars? 
We think money is for free or almost free, but with centralized we pay a lot to the central authority. But here we secure the decentralized system.
Alternative way of explaining is that we take the unstable value from fiat and through energy we transmute it into the stable value. It is kind a like when we take some energy source and transmute it in power plants into energy. The efficiency of our power plants is also very low (compared to annihilation). But humanity moves on.
With POS we are creating a world with people who will be more powerful than FED. I have no egalitarian argument against it. But maybe is too early for that and it can do horrible things with trust and price. But I own POS altcoins as a hedge.

No, I do not put faith into free market.
1st as you know there are sceptics and doomsayers for everything. And you also know that science never proves anything.
So there are a lot of people who are saying there is no global warming. There are people who are saying global warming will cause catastrophe. Where I am? In the middle ground fallacy? Also not. I do not give a shit. I am too busy with my business and in my positive and negative feedback loops.
The hope for most people is that the climatechange sceptics are right. I do not like either camp tbh - personally.
I think humanity is done. Poor people will die either way. I think bitcoin and following changes will destroy them sooner than potential climate change.
And for free market: I am just saying free market will do whatever he wants. free market does not care about people. But people are unable to make the good decisions for greater good. There are enough nations either directly unaffected by global warming and/or ignorant to see when it comes. Like if your almost landlocked country has just a bit more drought and floods and some refugees and prices of food go up, I grant you that if you are in power and you want to stay there then you will rather shoot the refugees and put more sources into industry that will make it for agriculture.
That is the free market. I do not believe we should solve the problems that are already decides, even when the result is horrible. Lets fight over blocksize for example ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:37:45
What can be good for economy (and it is questionable if low inflation is, but let's assume it is) is not good for money holders. So there is a conflict of interest which solves fiat, because it forces us to use to lower quality inflationary money, which are good for economics.
But since with cryptos there is the freedom of choice the advantage is on the side of bitcoin for exactly the reasons you quoted.
There will be relatively few big winners and many small losers.

You have some problem to follow logic. I do not know if they had or did not really have the money. That is not the point.
The point is that once you do not pay taxes, police does not work for free. In Brazil strikes of police everyone sees it. Even if police "works" it is disaster. When they stop it is the end of the world.
So once people pay even less of taxes the violence in Brazil will destroy the country. Even now I was robbed at knifepoint in Brazil few times. I saw gas station assaulted with guns. How do you think this will work without police? It will not.
There is no solution for Brazil. Of course you are also right that everything that is being paid goes to politicians. You pay less: things get worse. You pay more and it is just stolen. It is disaster there.

Yes I agree, but I would rephrase it even further: deflationary currency isn't good for our current economy *and society*
Our society from historical standpoint is still quite equal. It is somewhere in middle between capitalism and socialism. It is maybe a sweet spot between efficiency of capitalism and equality of socialism. If we move towards independent money - not because society wants it - but because it is the devil's invention (one smart minister of economy called bitcoin like that and I agree), then we shift whole society more into capitalism. Can the society be still coherent? I highly doubt so. There will be even more talk against the evil billionaires, more hate and less compassion.
Now about the billionaires and what you are missing:
There are poor (low class), poorer&amp;richer (middle class) and the rich.
The really rich are out of game. I can tell you, because I am already. You do not pay income taxes (unless US citizen), you do not belong anywhere, it is weird but interesting life. But you are not much part of society. You are welcomed everywhere, you pay some direct taxes, but that is it. Most of the money are in some virtual casino, because you of course do not spend it in your life. Maybe before dead you throw it away to some charity. But the rich do not contribute in any society comparably to their net worth (at least not directly; indirectly they might like if Musk makes travelling to space a norm etc.).
Then there is the low and middle class and the inflation and taxes are redistribution from the richer middle class to less rich middle class and sometimes also to the poor (and also to the richest). It is not just subsidizing, it is all public goods like infrastructure, healthcare, public security. The coherent society itself is the biggest public goods.
But if you lower taxes (including the hidden inflation tax) and if you let people hoarding, you draw another border somewhere inside of the middle class. Not even the richest will be out of game, but even the richer will be much more. And the poorer and poor will be fucked up and then whole society will be fucked up.
This already can be seen in Africa and South America where the social consensus was never found and the society de facto does not exist. There are different classes that live separately in the same country. 
So no, inflation and fiat money is really a tool that brings a lot of power and assets to the states, which redistribute the wealth then more or less to the ones who are not so competitive. But billionaires are out of game either way (they might profit from the inflation as well, but they can profit from many other things even from deflation for sure).

The property across millionaires is unequally distributed (as it is across all the people).
As bitcoin is being adopted we see even more unequal distribution across bitcoiners and across all the people (99.9% have zero bitcoin).
First of all I would like to hear arguments why and when this unequality will be reversed and then broken. Because I do not see it and I do not see a single reason for it.
And it is also economically impossible: imagine 32,999,999 millionaires having their 21000000/32999999 th of bitcoin (for simplicity we neglect that there will not be 21M bitcoins mined, that everyone who has 999,999 USD and less has zero bitcoin and that the billionaires have the same fraction of bitcoin as the last millionaire.
Then why should be price of bitcoin the same as now is out of my reach.
TL;DR you can not apply laws of Newtonian physics or basic school algebra to economics.

Bitcoin needs both exchange and hodling. And that is btw exactly what is happening and that is why we see this surge.
Even if there would be the 159 people hodling 100K and one would sell, then the 100K would be in circulation.
The 159 people would be top 159 charts of Forbes, but in a way just on paper. Exactly as Satoshi-ghost now "has" ghost 8B.
There will be always enough money to circulate; the deflation of the circulating money is determined by the amount of money taken out by die hard hodlers.
This is also a reason why does not matter to count with market caps of gold or gold+all money or more assets. If bitcoin swallows this, then the theoratical market cap will be much higher. Most of btc coins will be out of market. Just small part of bitcoins will be circulating and determining the price.
More and more people will be in situation like me: I have more than enough money for living. I do not need to consume more or buy anything else. If I do not find an investment that I like, I will keep money in btc, that will just appreciate in long term extremely. So my money is completely out of market. Exactly like Satoshi's.

My point with vulcano is that Bitcoin still uses much less energy that a vulcano I was just visiting and that is "vasting it". The energy from vulacno goes "nowhere" if I look at it from the leftists standpoint. It does not bring anything to anyone and it produces CO2.
Bitcoin is using energy of a city (say some people). Is it really too much? If price goes up 10x and it uses energy for a country (if we do not have better chips) is it too much? I would like to know why? From pure market standpoint maybe some useless country like Venezuela is stealing energy/sources from bitcoin.
I am exaggregating of course. But we do not know how will network under POS work. At Stratis for example there are no problems I think. Now ETH will be testnet. We know that with bitcoin the holy trio: devs-users-miners creates stability through chaos. But what will happen when there is just users=stakers and devs? Will it be really stable? If we look into fiat world the central banks play the third leg. They are at least pretending they are neutral to governments, so in fiat system is the holy trinity as well (governemnt, citizens, central banks) and the system is more stable the more independent the central bank is [yes it is always dependent and this is why we have cryptos].

Few months ago there were riots because police went on strike. Because local government had no money to pay them. Mortality rate quadrupled (even from the high rate before). The chaos ended when federal forces came there.
Without even the rest of taxes this will be reality in Brazil.

"Problem is that problems were covered."
But the problems were always real and they are covered even now. Every Brazilian is blaming government. No one is getting shit together. And it is hard to blame them, it is impossible there. Politicians are just like Brazilians are. I tried many years to do something there. Impossible. Brazil is a black hole. I pity the people there, but they are both victims and the ones who are responsible.

No, I am not talking about Brazil. It is just a country where I accidentally bought a house.
Look at the list here:  
The more green columns in the 1st 5 columns the "better".
Substract the states with oil rent.
Or take broader approach. Look at top and bottom countries by GDP per capita, HDI or similar. Look at taxes or rather involvement of state in economy. It is huge by top. Minimal at bottom. No coincidence. Private sector is unable to invest into large infrastructure projects. Even Musk is getting taxpayer money through state contracts.

I do not know why you think it is normal to make 1M or 10M or 1B or whatever amount and quit with Lambo and hookers. But I read this nonsense over and over.
Once you have the money you can finally feel how not important it is. The dream of financial independence is valid only before you reach it.
I think Roger is now on the wrong side of history, but he was on the right side. He pushes his ideals and it is ok. I think his ideals are really idealistic - big block bitcoin is open to attacks and he will not be able to buy his country even if he is the richest guy in the universe. Also buying upvotes or miners will not do that. I think he is a naive and in a way simple. But it is great he is trying to do something, because in the end he can recognize he is now way off (or I will see I am way off selling BCH).
I really do not like what RV does to BTC, but if there is something even more ugly, it is the people involved in crypto, who did nothing and they just dream about getting rich and doing nothing. And they expect from others doing the same.
Money is power in 1st place. It was always like that and always will be like that. People do not hoard money in excessive amounts just to eat 1000 lunches a day (Kim dot com maybe yes). They do it to pursue their ideals and the ideals then clash and our world is the result.

Job: do not quit. 2M is not that much. Anything can happen.
However living paycheck to paycheck is a bit off. I am not telling you to start to spend. But maybe you *could* do some more risky business decisions. However I say "could" and not "can" since you told you have history of poor decisions. You gotta change your mind anyways or you will lose the money from bitcoins somehow and that would be sad.
Divorce: hard to say. I had gf, she was never working. Took part of my bitcoins. She was not my wife, so she was not probably legally allowed to ask for anything. But I would not do it again. However if you split, then the money is the smaller problem if you really love her. But that is a question for you and not for public forum. Be honest to yourself. And imagine her now fucking with other guy (or similar situations) and if you still want to split the bitcoins.
Selling: Follow Roger Ver is you still hodl. Once BTC+forks goes 10x up and you still hodl, renounce citizenship. Get out of USA. You save on taxes (you really do not have to tell IRS about BTC in that case, because once you will be selling, you will not have an US passport/residence), but the best thing is that your life will be an adventure and you will learn many things. However the probability of the "divorce" part will be higher.

See headline here? "Bitcoin Casino Gambling Surges In March With Over 1 Billion Bets". 
Yes I have sources. I am actually quite big in that sector.
To write


...is completely deceiving. Provably fair bitcoin gambling is losing each year the market share of overall Bitcoin gambling, even when it is rising. It is nonsignificant. 360K is nothing. Even 10x more is just nothing. Provable fair gaming is just a concept for geeks and early adopters. No wonder it raised now, because value of bitcoin raised. But the new people who use bitcoins to gamble do not care about provable games. They just need bitcoins to get money to casinos.




But maybe not. Maybe is really better to confuse everybody with articles like this based on yours.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:44:12
The money and bitcoin is great for those who have it. There is 21M of btc. Stupid is anyone who does not bought or is not buying now.
However bitcoin will not change things for better for everyone or not even for most, even if it is fully adopted as reserve currency.
Bitcoin will indeed make economy more competitive and effective, because there will be no fiat disruptions to economy. But this is a double edged sword. Most people are not effective and competitive and they do not want to be. They will suffer. Fiat was not just a tool for manipulation for everyone and something made only for banksters and politicians. It is also a redistribution tool of wealth from those who are relatively richer to those who are relatively poorer. If fiat vanishes then there will either be another redistribution tool: taxes (and that is very doubtful) or the society will change a lot. And that change will not be welcomed by the non-competitive majority. And this will trigger other changes.
I think the changes are inevitable, but future is neither black or pink. It is grey. Unless you have bitcoins. Then it is pink.

Yes, I saw the site. Sorry but what is the point of tracking numbers of ~ 1% of bitcoin gambing and then make conclusions based on that? It is a very small sample and therefore it is misleading.
360K seems to most like a big money, but it is really nothing for gambling sector. The number is not a nonsense, but it is a nonsense to make conclusions based on that. There are other much more significant indicators that bitcoin and gambling is doing well.

@_date: 2017-04-16 01:51:41
It is not an endless supply. It would be an endless supply if you had no trust in the combo government-banks. But there is trust. Even me and you if we are sceptics, have some trust. For example in greed of bankers who do not want to be fired for causing hyperinflation. Or we trust that politicians have 2 goals: their own pockets &amp; being re-elected, so they can not drain the economy completely.
The "endless supply" is in a way the same as 51% attack. If there is a miner who has 51% what will he do (if he is rational)? Right... he would not anything else than what he does under 51%! The same is with rational banks and states. They should not be crazy with monetary policy.
The problem is what we get with crazy politicians, banks and miners... they create more money than they should and endless stalemates.
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:20:52
Yes, the invisible hand is at work. So there is no problem. What you just described is normal human nature,esp.nature of rich people. It happened b4 and it will happen again in future.
Big miners are something like central banks. What do central banks do most? They try to be credible. If they are not then markets do not believe them and then even they suffer.
Again: it is just natural to be deceptive and manipulative. More for the rich. But along with money comes responsibility and if one is not able to control himself, he will pay for that.
I think this is a great news for bitcoin.

I think RV is really an ideological guy. He probably invested everything he has to large blocks. So he needs even more support for his agenda. After all, it is fine. True man has to put money where his mouth is.

Money need real users. The value of bitcoin now is of course long enough done not through the great features that bitcoin has. Bitcoin adds everyday more users than any other altcoin, those users are from "cryptocurrency virgins" and bitcoin is being used for day to day transactions.
This is btw also why bitcoin fees raise. Only bitcoin is commercially successful project, so there is money that can be made with it (I mean intristically, not by ICO etc).

Took MA, not true.
Each money is backed by trust and trust only. Either directly (like with fiat you trust to government that it will not do some shit if you hodl the fiat), or indirectly (with gold backed money you simply trust to gold and that the gold will not lose the value because of market and also that the money will be forever backed by gold).
@_date: 2017-04-16 18:52:06
It depends how the money is defined. It can be m0, m1, m2, m3. I think, if m2 is taken as "money", then not even 8% is "physical" of it.

1. masters
2. nothing has intristic value, everything is just subjective; there is no intristic value of copper, there is just a value in your trust that copper will stay "copper", e.g. in 1st place there will be no substitutes of copper and people will have to buy copper for the wires etc
with so called "commodity backed money" it is difficult; once the money become backed by the commodity, it is not only that commodity gives value to money, but the money create extra value of the commodity -&gt; if gold is not be used as storage of value, the price would be much much lower (compare scarcity Platinum vs Gold; Pt is much more scarce, but cheaper than gold etc)

It is declining in comparison to bitcoin gambling, that is not provably fair. 
2011 was probably close to 100% bitcoin gambling provably fair.
2017 was just the absolute minimum (aka 360K/month) provably fair. Most bitcoins for gambling go now to nonprovably fair casinos.

The problem with poker is, that unlike casinos or sportsbets, there is a big network effect by poker. You can start a small bitcoin casino or bookie, and you might make some money that willstart growing. But it is very hard to start a poker room down from the scratch, because there are no players. And since there are no players, no new players come. So you have to have connection with the bitcoin poker to the fiat poker. This "lack of poker liquidity" is being solved by poker newtworks, where more poker rooms share the same players.
Decent poker you can play at Bovada or 5dimes for example, but through bitcoins not in bitcoins.

you can apply subjective theory of value, there is no such a difference as you think, that is all I can say
look at Charlie Schrem prison monetary system: they used as money mackerels - the point is that they used even rotten ones
or another prison money- cigarettes; even the ones that were unsmokable were used
or the huge stones used as money in Pacifics; they were so big that nobody could use them anymore, they even did not move the stones
if the money is "commodity backed" the value separates of the money itself; this is also why bitcoin is superior to altcoins... most people still believe that it is about code and usability and that many shitcoins have intristic value in better code/team... it is wrong from the same reason

**Practically all US gambling casinos and bookies do accept bitcoin.** Many give special bonuses for bitcoin deposits, because they are cheap even with mempool full. 


No, gamblers do not give a shit. Some complain like you that casinos cheat, only to cover their idiocy and destructive habits. In fact, most casinos do not cheat directly. They do not need it. The house edge and human greed bring them enough money. (Casinos cheat much more in other ways, like they give bonuses that are impossible to clean or they simply do not pay.)

There is a clear difference between what is the purpose of mining and what (probably) should be.
Since mining is linear (e.g. bigger miners or pools are not "taxed"), there is a huge economy of scale = network effect of mining = natural monopoly.
If mining has to be decentralised there should be some change of the code that would put the bigger miners into disadvantage.
On the other hand, the monopoly itself as Yoghurt114 said is not always the destructive part; it is abusing the monopoly and it happens only if there are no strong market forces that will punish such an abuse.

But 360K/Month is nothing. That is an income of one mid-size online casino.
And that number is nonsense btw. If counted all online casinos that accept btc just to transfer the money, but convert to fiat, then the casinos and bookies made much more. Where users used bitcoins *only* for banking but not betting.. they lost in March only way over 10M for sure.
Most casino players really do not care about provably fair games and they do not care about bitcoins too. They just use btc as "transfer money".

As quite happy user of HW wallet I do not see a reason why to trust HW wallet more than SW wallets.
With HW wallet you never know what comes inside of the HW. There can be always some man in the middle attack or bad employee at Ledger or Trezor.
Unlike with major SW wallets that are transparent and observed by many sharp minds all the time.
My sysadmin, who is also crypto investor, does not even touch HW wallets. He does not trust them. I am not that paranoid (and I am not that technically skilled as my sysadmin, so I might make a mistake with installing and securing the SW wallet), but your risk evaluation is off.

They are not safe and they will never be. World is dangerous, much more than corporations and politicians pretend. Just live with that and take the risks.
If you do not keep money there, so you have it there just for example 3 days a year, you reduce the risk of fraud under 1% (3/365). If you use your own and/or dedicated email, it is another minimalization. If you use dedicated computer (so it has no keylogger) it is another step forward (I think almost anybody has an old laptop, why not doing factory reset and use it ONLY for this?) Etc. You can just minimalize risks. If you add the probabilities and do 3 steps that minimalize hack to 1%, the risk goes to 0.01x0.01x0.01 = 1 millionth. It is still not safe, but much better.

In case of robbery the HW wallet is the most dangerous one, because more and more people know what is inside.
I never store substantial amounts of bitcoins there for a long time. Using it as cold wallet is not safe. Probability of being robbed in the USA is roughly 1:1000, in other countries can be even higher.
The danger is much higher if someone around knows that you have bitcoins and you were attacked on purpose, because then they will search the bitcoins and once the HW wallet is found, you can not say it is your encrypted porn.
Stop being an idiot if you have substantial share of your wealth in btc and do not use HW wallet as cold wallet.

This math would make sense only if there is equal distribution of gold (and other assets). But it is very far from reality.
Even if we assume that bitcoin will replace just gold, then the price of the last pieces of gold exchanged for the last bitcoin would not be 500K USD. It would be much higher.
My wild shot is that even if 1/10 of gold reserves are transferred into BTC, the price would be over 500M easily. It all depends in a way how much recent hodlers want gold. I do not think hodlers want to hold gold instead of btc that much (I have some gold true...).

If people and businesses decide to hold just one-third of their wealth in Bitcoin rather than dollars, the value of Bitcoin will be much higher than 1/3 of value of USD.
They have to buy the bitcoins from hodlers, who will not give it up for cheap. It is not like a new redistribution. Bitcoin is mostly being owned by few whales. In other words GINI coeficient for btc is much higher than any money, shares or tradeable assets. The premium that is and has to be paid for btc will be extreme.

No, no problem at all *for me*, the price is counted always as spot price. Of course it means that bitcoin is not money yet fully, because "The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment." - so bitcoin here fails as unit of account. But there is a long way to change this. It will be the last step.

There is no perfect solution for anybody. If AA said HW wallet is good warm wallet, then he is right.
The best solution for big investment is to have more wallets, where the majority off btc will be really bulletproof. Not only against attacks through virtual world.

I buy drugs maybe twice a year. Even that is not illegal. Selling is.
Other things like moving money abroad or pay people or be paid by others is not illegal.
I think bitcoin has not just reputation to be used for illegal things; it simply makes sense to use it for illegal things at the moment. But I personally am quite an exception. Without DNM would be bitcoin just a kids play still. It was the first kick and bitcoin needs more of those kicks. Whatever the reputation is is irrelevant.

Of course that your security is your fault. This is not a retail bank, that is the point. Securing a bank is much easier, because everything can be tracked and mostly reverted, so attackers do not even try many things. With cryptos you are responsible for security - be it your wallet or the exchange. Using (unsecured) gmail for crypto security is your fault. The exchange did not force you to use gmail.
Sure it is their fault as well, if they ignored you, but that is kind of expected. If you did your job, you would have your money.

You maybe live in Western Europe that is safe by now and this is why many dangerous people want to be there. But Bitcoin is for the whole world and so is this sub.
I also have Ledger Nano S and if I see another one I know what it is. If btc will succeed soon many people will know what is HW wallet. Like in 70s not many people knew what is a credit card and that it is money; now everybody knows.
Also what security it is if random attacker can steal balance with 1:3333 probability? Nonrandom attacker like someone from family or friends for most people will have much greater chance of success. Especially if people feel false security because they have The HW Wallet. I bet many people use at HW wallet the same PIN as for their cc or so (even I do it at HW wallet, but it is my hot wallet). This PIN is probably known by someone else in family or so.

The hot desktop wallets can be also much colder. It depends how one uses it (on which HW). I think desktop or mobile wallets can be safer than HW wallets. At least when someone sees a computer he does not know there are bitcoins inside. Also the default security of Ledger Nano S 3/10000 that random attack will break it is nothing great. Wallets like Electrum can be much safer... but it is not about wallet but about user.

That is interesting that you are not aware of if you read this sub at least a bit.
If you held any BTC by 1st Aug and controlled private keys, you have BCH, even when you do not know.
If you held the BTC by the date at some exchange, you still have a decent chance to have it.
But in the fist case you must do some tricks to retrieve the BCH. And part of the trick is to move your BTC first, because the BCH shares the same private keys and you do not want to expose the BTC private keys.
The same will happen on 25th Aug, when you will have the same amount of XBG as you have BTC now and you should do the same trick.
In both cases BCH and XBG you of course can choose not to do anything. But then you have not those "free" coins.

It is cool. Are people encouraged to use it this way? No. Not even in this thread.
Having HW wallet is like having licence plate BITC0IN. It is not the safest way. There is no safest way. It is a good compromise for people who do not want to go deeper, but they should know it is just the compromise and in the way of physical world they are the most exposed.
Would be really nice if there is a HW wallet that would be also a flash memory card and that would look like flash memory card at least for the 1st sight.

Thank you for calling me idiot, even when you do not know anything, probably not even what is hot wallet.
I do not care about pennies: be it cash, credit cards or the hot wallet. My HW wallet is my hot wallet, because it has not enough security as cold wallet. If the money is gone, is gone. If you care about pocket change, you will never make big money.
Your "completely random" pin is still something that can be randomly guessed.

I do not know either. Moderating a forum is not that hard if you are an owner. Bit this is Reddit&amp;Bitcoin. The more stupid people are the more they talk about censorship, corporations and so on. r/bitcoinmarkets work quite fine and I think only because they ask be nice one to each other. I think this should be the general rule and anything that goes towards personal attack should be removed. We all take cryptos personally, it is our life, but the debate should be focused on concepts or helping people. And yeah, memes should fuck off as well.

Yes, probably in the USA. That is &lt; 5% of population.
Ok. So I reveal the password "password1" (which is the favourite password of my wife) to the wallet and bitcoins/iotas/whatever are gone. The wallet was hacked. What then?
Again: do not tell me I am doing that. People will. Even in the USA, but yeah, you have even things like civil forfeiture, so you will handle it somehow b4 you destroy last piece of sanity.

I am genuinely curious who downvoted you and why. Apparently not mostly women.
Btw. the truth is that this is a war of sexes. Just the men decided collectively that it is better to survive with silence. And I do not blame women for the war. It is the weak men who lost it from the beginning and allowed the stupid narratives that we see.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:22:27
I can feel you, I have the same repeated experience.
However: there are surprises in the world and bigger than the btc price hikes. One of them is that not all women are like that. You just have to play hard on all levels. There really exist the few brave women that fight for their place and their ego has no problem with the fact that men are simply better in certain areas.
So all the bullshit around is maybe just a test. Test for both men and women to get out of it. Both sexes looking for comfortable life that will be approved by society are failing. There are no winners. There is no winning or better story that we should listen. The recent "female stories" will not get better if they are replaced by macho stories.
In other words: I do not pity the men who are broken by bitches. It is their fault that they were not questioning upfront what the society was serving to them. It is all ok! Let those stupid stories how woman can be equal programmers prevail, even when it is obvious that it is impossible (I am project manager of my own business and while it is hard to work with male-devs, it is impossible with woman-devs). It is just the test for those who are willing to see the obvious truth.
You are not helping anyone with the approach that after they will be old or older and see the truth, they can go back and get the feet on the ground seeing that others see it too. What you are doing is just repeating what the women do. Strong people can live alone and fight alone. Peace for you.

It depends on who is "we". I use bitcoin at darkmarkets. I use bitcoin to be paid by people who can not pay me cheaper by other ways. I use bitcoin for moving money abroad, because - again - it is cheaper than VISA or bank wire. I do NOT use bitcoin because it is bitcoin and where it is more complicated and expensive. It is nonsense just to buy things with BTC and then going to buy BTC. That is not the action needed by BTC, because BTC is not needed at the action.

It depends on your overall bankroll. If you have 30M for example, then the 10% might be enough for living. But yes, the OP probably does not have 8 figures, because he would not mention 20K.
Either way "fuck you" portfolio is for pussies. Not everybody wants to live the stupid life of cowards. Putting money, where the mouth is, is important and is not a problem if one has money. There really is not a big difference to have 1M or 10M for life. I just tried business class and then 1st class and yeah, it is nice, but not a life changer.

I think I am in less than 0.1% if we measure users, but it still is more than other cryptos.

I always wonder how people who make paperwallets are so sure about security. I am not a cryptographer, so I can not say how secure is the process of creating them. But they are being created on some computer so there must be always some security hole (like no one can be assured the computer never connects anywhere).
Either way: storing a physical passphrase is dangerous. Even if split, even if further encrypted. I am doing that, I think it is fairly safe, but there are holes. Each system has holes.
And with all the forks and airdrops going on, one has to take btcs out of storages and create new ones. It already is at last part time job, if there are a lot of addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:09:42
I have never sold anything significant. Started to buy at 400, but on the way down in 2014, I have sub 200 coins, the most of them I bought sub 1000. Bitcoin did not make me rich. I already were.
I pay few people, I buy some small things like drugs, I buy some altcoins, not much. Just the ones I like (I will refrain talking about them here, but I do not have one single ETH).
But I am still paid in BTC by few merchants and I even bought the recent 3k dip because it was obvious. So I am still getting more bitcoins. I am investing into bitcoin business, so I guess I will accumulate in future.
My problem is that I have enough fiat and I do not need to sell btc (btc is now like 80% of my net worth).
So I do not have a target, I live most of the time modest life, I absolutely do not need the money. I would sell maybe if we see some spike like 500%+ increase in one month or so, otherwise I believe the party will not be over for very long time. If we see the pace of growth like last 1.5 year I will probably hodl forever, unless there is some promising altcoin.
But seriously I do not want to risk my money with manipulating the market. I am actually a trader originally, but I do not have slightest idea how to handle this circus most of the time with bigger money. Even if I knew I do not want to go against anyone who might have some real info and not some bs. I am just happy hodler.

Everyone has some options, not everyone has all the options.
There are possibilities of IP whitelists or payout whitelists at exchanges for example.
I do not trust corporate 3rd party emails. I just do not. They are known to cooperate with police, it should be expected that there are backdoors for NSA or such agencies. Yes, it is paranoia, but this is about bitcoin. To buy VPS and domain for your own email is maybe a lot of learning, but worth of it. Or maybe you have an expert in family... Yes, then you rely on that person, but still much better than to give up your data to Google.
The person used 2fa from Google at the exchange but did not use 2fa at Gmail. So the gmail was compromised I think. Using 2fa for both email and exchange greatly reduces the risk for sure. But only reduces.

Yes, I mean the businesses too. They will have to change too. Like: what is business? Making money with some paper from state until now. In future it will be making money without the paper. Btc-e/Snowcrash style.
It is pointless to think regulation is needed as is pointless to be scared of it or take it as hostile takeover. If something can be regulated, it will be just a small bonus. If the regulation is not desired, it will be ignored (and it will happen most of the times, AA talks about it frequently).
I am personally for the strictest regulation of bitcoin if I have to choose. It will legalize cryptos into some extent, it will create huge chaos and inconsistency in laws and the rest will be neglected by the real crypto businesses that will flourish a bit faster.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:06:15
I think if another huge dip happens, I will not be able to resist again. And since I feel that, you feel that, it makes sense to conclude that dips will be bought.
There are your frieends and shorters (I know such people only from reddit), who slow down the growth, but they are running out of bitcoins, while hodlers and BTFDers are getting more wealthy and more powerful.
So we have a system with limited and diminishing supply of new coins and people who hold the bitcoins every day more and more tight, because they see it works and it works every day better.
I mean, I have so many doubts about everything. About human lives, how we are all fragile. About animals, about cultures... But I really do not see a scenario how could bitcoin go down or not grow in short or mid term. Forks will be ok, it is nothing so much important. So the only interesting thing is the pace of growth and pace of adoption.

If btc has to be compared to gold then the 266K is really the low limit. Gold already is distributed, bitcoin is not. The last units of bitcoins will be sold very high if all gold value has to move into btc.
But also the comparison fails here: if there is high demand for gold, then additional gold can be mined, recycled etc. for higher price. With bitcoin this is impossible. Gold supply is not determined as bitcoin's. This causes a feedback loop at gold price that is being stabilized. E.g. higher demand for gold drives up the price, the higher price drives up supply of gold and this drives down the price of gold. We will not see anything like that by bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:34:16
Markets indeed are always irrational, but as time goes, agents become more rational when solving/betting on certain kind of problems. But also as time goes, agents have to bet on different problems. So the markets are both irrational and also becoming more rational.

Then it is not an advice for you, because you either bought the BTC after 1st Aug or already cashed out the BCH, did you?
Either way on 25th Oct will be another useless fork - Bitcoin Gold. And you will be holding bitcoingold shitcoin as well along with your bitcoin. If you want to sell the XBG, you should move the real bitcoins to new paper wallet first.

Nothing can break you unless you want. So if something breaks you, then you wanted it. If you (or I) wanted something self-destructive, then there is the understanding why you or I wanted it. I think there is really a reason why men repeat the femalish bullshit so it became a mainstream. It is up to everyone to locate and battle this inside. 
There is no coincidence that you broke the back by reading redpill shit. Idk what it is about tbh, I just heard it from my ex-bitch, who loved to read it for reason that is still a mystery for me, but it solves nothing. When bullshit like red pill exists then it means that women won (because men act exactly like them) and that means everyone lost on a large scale.
Anyways it will be interesting times ahead (unless all men became gays). But again: if you find the way, the woman will appear and you do not have to do anything for that. You have just to do everything else.

Are you funny or retarded or American? 4 or 8 digits with 3 attempts vs. attempt to guess the private keys pu on the same line?
"Get a trezor, memorize the 25 word seed and secure it on paper. " is your words. Great advice, really. Until someone finds the seed. There is maybe 10M of people now who know what is seed and what random 25 words mean. In 5 years it will be maybe 500M of people.
Do a favor to the world. Leave those advises to yourself. HW wallets  do not have enough security to be considered cold storages. That is why AA calls them warm. For me it is hot, because I use them with my generic PIN, so when I am out of home and need the btc, I know I will not reset it. Btw. the PIN is 2247. As on few of my cards.

Judges definitely are very dumb. They have no clue about online things and even less about bitcoins. They do not know what is a domain, what is hosting. They constantly ask people from my hosting company to reveal passwords and they do not understand it is not possible, because the hosting company does not have the passwords. Stories like that over and over again.
To forget private keys, or to not have access to btc is common. This is not about me. How will they handle situation, where you, your wife and a friend will have multisig 2/3 wallet and the friend will agree that you have to get the money?

Nope. If you live in Germany most of the year - this is what counts. Even with French account.
(Yes, it is a problem,since there are no borders in EU, so it is harder to prove that you lived there, because there are no stamps in the passport; so you have to eventually show your bank and credit card statement that you lived in Germany, utility bills etc. At least this is how it is done in another EU country and it will not be that different. You know Monaco tax heaven and tennis players who "stay" there and prove it in a way, where they have equipment that switches on and off electricity and they intentionally waste more water etc.)

You can not make the flip from fiat/centralized economy to BTC without people investing into BTC. Most people will not go into the hassles with tech things.
Then you have 2 ways: wait until the old ones die and the new ones from snowflakes will be able to handle pkeys \[big doubt about it still, in reality the people will be probably just technically dumber than now\]; or you provide them the opportunity to be in through the soft way.

It is half true. Maybe 75% true if said in this environment. Human history or history of everything that is alive is fight. Fight to death. One can and should feel compassion with anybody, but it does not mean that the enemy is a friend.
So... no. The bank CEO is an enemy with everything he represents. Including the old pre-internet and pre-blockchain world. Indeed everything takes time; the fighting takes time and the winning takes time.
Blockchains are something that will be adopted by banks but not that it will merge with them. They will make empty shells out of them. They will also change society and in many (I think most ways) that are not taken as positive by most people.

If you can not convert it to fiat, then fiat becomes even more restricted piece of nothing. Which means that there is even more need for free cryptocurrency. Which is as we know...
It is the same as currencies in socialist economies. They also had and have restricted use. Still the other currency, that is being banned, has the trust of people.
In short: if they want to ban the bitcoin, let they do it. It will only help Bitcoin. If they allow it... then it will help Bitcoin as well.

I do not know. If it is the theoretical case where btc is being split 50-50 vs. 100-0 + jail, then it is about the risk being caught. I do not think the risk being caught is &gt; 1% even if you, but also it depends if you talk or meet with the ex-wife, you have some mutual friends etc.
If it is about big money, then I take as granted to move to another country, burn bridges etc. After all after divorce is the best time doing that.
My point is simply that with crypto new problems emerge. Like what is it to own bitcoins? To know the private keys? If yes, then the wives are fucked.
If not, then what is it? Then it also mean that one can have bitcoins even without knowing the private keys!
This is a clash of the old and the new world. Ownership defacto is about having the private keys, but de iure it is and for a while it will be probably different.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:24:52
It might level up, because there will be less bitcoins for sale, since the btc for the last billion will be most likely off market. With any bitcoin sold the rest of bitcoins are harder to acquire, because the hodlers are tougher and tougher.
The price is still relatively low thanks miners who have to sell. But after 2020 halving it might be really crazy. Probably even before. Well it already is.

Well, it is what they all think now.
In fact it is cryptos that will regulate and create the new laws. Why? Because you can not regulate this. You can not make a law that bitcoin is owned by this or that entity, if it is a clash with reality that anybody with private keys has the bitcoin.
Also it is hard to make a law that all forks of bitcoin at some exchange or no fork at some exchange belongs to the original owner. In 1st case there will be malicious forks over and over; in second case it would be a theft.
Let they try to regulate. Why not. I do not care. Even if cypherpunks ask state to regulate it, even if some other people bitch about it. It is not important.

I am somehow missing what is the fact? That devs have consensus? Ok.
What if there is a consensus of people that do not give a fuck about "the devs" and also "the miners". What if they vote with legs?
Unlike altcoin shills I do not think it is happening yet. But I am almost adding "unfortunately". I think only if another altcoin was used as money, would be the wake up call for everybody.
It is obvious that the scaling debate is not about scaling. It is about preserving the stalemate. It is perfectly rational by miners. But why devs do it? Are they really so stupid to play the game with miners or should I wear the tinfoil hat and think about the conspiracy and divided yield here?

Miners make money. Big money. Many peple argue they would make more if scaling happened etc. But it is really not sure. The real transactions are way lower than 3/sec. It is really not sure if the smaller transactions would happen and how would be overall revenue. There are still many ways how miners can lose alot of profit after scaling and there is a chance that bitcoin can work even with high fees. I do not see anything certain. Of course I see much less things than Jihan, but If I were in his position, I can imagine than for my max profit I would do the same as he is doing. Unless UASF or something like that would be a real threat.

Altcoin price is skyrocketing for more reasons:
1. People **think** that there is a real problem with bitcoin, but the problem is maybe not here.Yes is piss me off too to pay the high fees, but bitcoin has the strong network effect and miners count with that. Who uses XMR at DM? Not many.
2. Most altcoins do not compete with btc as money. They aspire to provide other services. Some, like STRAT, are even planning to be something like the bitcoin's sidechain (out of btc blockchain).
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:42:08
Do you think the current state is unfavourable for miners? For all miners? I do not think so.
And bitcoin holds up. Ok, maybe it would be 10K with segwit. But maybe not. I think bitcoin must go to real shit and price has really to plummet (not just grow at lower pace than alts), so something will happen. But Bitcoin still has a lot of use and for higher transactions is still very cheap. Also the network spam has its limits and I think we are almost there. I think the spammers (I bet the Jihan or whole Chinese group) can not spam much more, because the costs are already very high and they sponsor other miners too.
So if what is happening is favourable for them, why should they change anything now?
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:02:29
If you buy BTC and move them around (and split), there is no way for them to know or even proof if you arethe owner or someone else is. Owner can be even nonexistent, if nobdy has private keys. You could gamble the money away for example.
This is why is good to move coins once a year or so (but keep the old addresses and keys if needed to prove).

The inflation is defacto a hidden tax too. So it is not just the economic argument. It goes to sociology as well. If state loses that tax income, the state will not provide something.
So the state service will shrink. Poor will get poorer, rich will get richer. The economy should be more pro-market, but this should in theory lead to less stable society. If society that is now used to get subsidised healthcare, pools and indergartens loses those benefits, it will be more wiling to accept some authoritarian regimes.
Also inflation tax is a common source for wars and defense for ages. The countries that will not be able to use that tax will be weaker. The countries that will beable to use inflation tax (the ones against cryptos) will be stronger. Anyone can do the math then.

Fiat currencies will not be replaced without huge amount of chaos and violence. Do you expect - on the top by 2022 - that on one nice day there will be a meeting at the central bank and they will say: "O.k guys, let's give up. Let's throw away monetary policy during the crisis that never ends. Let's throw away our salaries and social positions. Let's throw away our reputation. Let's start the huge austerity era, that never existed. Let's throw all indebted people into a hole. Let's rebuild the debt economy from day to day. Let's do it alltogether with all other central banks, because if we do not do it, then we are giving advantage to any other inflation economy that will have not so huge budget problems."
I believe that the changes above - more or less - will happen. I even believe that bitcoin or some crypto will be the world reserve currency. But the process will not be that fast. Fiat world will have to collapse in stages and it will not give up 1 inch for nothing.

They created an app, where you can choose high/normal/low fee. Low fee was before still way too high. Then there was an option "custom", but the custom option did not allow you to put fees below some threshold. It used to be 100 sat/B. Now I send with 20 sat/B, so they probably updated something.
But I do not see how people like me and all dumber can change the fees if even the custom option refuses it. It would mean that I would have to go to github and change the code there somehow. Or I would have to ask expert to do it...

“The choice between the blue or the red pill is not really a choice between illusion and reality. Of course The Matrix is a machine for fictions, but these are fictions which already structure our reality. If you take away from our reality the symbolic fictions that regulate it, you lose reality itself. (…) I want a third pill. So what is the third pill? Definitely not some kind of transcendental pill which enables a fake fast food religious experience, but a pill which would enable me to perceive not the reality behind the illusion, but reality in illusion itself. (…) Our fundamental delusion today is not believing in what is only a fiction, to take fictions too seriously – on the contrary, it is not taking fictions seriously enough.”

I am no IT expert, I am the opposite. I hope I never wrote I am the expert. Double encrypted = encryption + strong password for the wallet itself, which is also encrypted. The passwords have 20+ characters all kinds and are always unique. I do not store them anywhere but in my head.
I have dedicated machine for this (rather than WM) + I use one more security thing I will not reveal here.
I also scattered parts of encrypted seed between people I know, but they generally do not know each other. There is a key how they have to put shit together if I am dead or someone hit my head hard so I forgot everything.
The point is to do the things secure even if one is no expert. It is impossible to be expert in all areas in this world, but it is necessary to do the things right. If it is about security, then non-experts have to be even more careful.
Based on your comments I assume you are the expert of IT and security. Now let's assume you are noob in cars and you are being forced to go around the world with some old rare but simple car. What will you take with you is something completely different than someone who knows the cars and probably can make all parts from a piece of iron.

Wtf? Get a life and understand economic reality. I get your point and yes, bitcoin is revolutionary. But the revolution will take at least generation. I mean it will take a lot of time until ppl secure their passwords, change the code etc.
This is really not about me. IT is about regular folks. I am using double encrypted desktop wallet and I can indeed change the fees. Yday 5 sat/B made instant conf. I just have 1 HW hot/travel wallet, because indeed I do not use cold wallets on computer that I use now.
But if you do not understand that 99% of people simply will not do patches on HW, you are missing the point. At least not in this generation. The max they will do is that they will download some malicious code and will be tricked even by the HW wallet.

50k implies 1 trillion market cap
that is really a big amount that would need a lot of changes
e.g. a lot of value from gold would have to shift to btc
bitcoin is here for longer than 5 years and even when that change is happening, it happens slowly and those who were able to accept it are already in
to go 20x up from 40B valuation is astronomically harder than from 40M and that is astronomically harder than from 40k

Sadly making money through BTC hodling is closer to the lottery winning than making it through the business. It is not the same, but still the only work was to have strong hand. I do not say it is easy, but it is different than nursing a business.
I made 8 figures in business and 8 through hodling. And it is a big difference. Many hodlers will end like the lottery winners. People who hodl should actually start the business and get some real world experience. But it their life. I just see disasters coming. Making a certain goal is definitely a stupid idea. Another stupid idea is that some amount of money will change the life.

I wonder how much sense it has to discuss about deflationary or inflationary currency, when it really depends on the selected goods and services if it is deflationary or inflationary.
The flaws of inflation indexes is known as well but ok let's assume we can move over this and BTC is an example of extremely deflationary currency.
I for example favor deflationary currency because it somehow settles down the society. Ofc it means much less investment, GDP growth etc. But after all I am not important.
What is important is what if the market chooses the deflationary currency? What if the invisible hand chooses it? What if simply people want to hold deflationary money instead of inflationary, because they see the surplus of it (value of their own money rise) and they do not see or do not want to see the negative side. Deflationary currency may even be diminishing their benefit overall, but if it is like that I do not see help here. It is another tragedy of the commons.
In the past the deflationary currencies were left behind by central banks. But it was possible only bc the money was fiat. Something that banks had power to push. If cryptos are being chosen voluntarily I am afraid this choice is no more here.

Sure. Halvings will save 50% each 4 years. Price that matches market cap "easily above 7  trillion" mean that the price of bitcoin goes up about 50x. Let's count just 40x. We have 2 halvings until 2024 included. That means that the energy spent has to go up 10x. Right now Bitcoin is secured by .25% of electricity output on Earth. Is 2.5% still bearable? I think it still is, who cares about few more drops to global warming, but politicians will care. Telling "easily" is a bit overkill.

You can not know but the estimations, I believe, can be better. Many wallets set min fees incredibly high like 100 or even 300 sat/B. Many people do not interpret the estimation times correctly and there is no help from the wallets. Like there should be something like median time or "with this fee the payment will be delivered for 95%".

When you have smart contracts you do not have investors, devs who make them, and clerks who respond to emails? You do not have frontend site? You do not pay the smart contract fees?
I do not need to talk to someone who knows best. I am in gambling industry from 2005. I saw many projects that tried 0% edge. I saw even minus edge. All the projects failed. Even low edge projects never pushed through for broad public (Pinnacle is trying for it over the decade). 
Simply broad public is not sensitive to the house edge. This was proven by real gambling economy. High edge + high bonuses + high budget for marketing + high dividends is the way.

I think it is better not to talk about rationality here. People are divided into haters and lambos. BTC definitely needs the optimism for further progress. Talking/thinking about mining is the most important thing when we think about price. However this would not cause price overshooting, which is good for adoption of btc as investment vehicle and also it makes miners rich.
So let people talk about TA. Let's ignore that bitcoin is limited by sources.
Since nobody is reading this, I am now just thinking what would make with bitcoin some long energy crisis. Oil at 200 USD+ and so on. Hashrate might go down or the growth might be crippled \[no problem for BTC, can be problem for small POW alts\], but since the miners must be at least break even in long term, the price might shoot up. Also if 70s repeat, this might cause higher inflation of fiat, which might cause BTC/crypto to be even more attractive. So again, this doom might be good for bitcoin.

I do not say it is happening. But what is The Bitcoin? Litecoin is defacto bitcoin with segwit. The cafe I went to just switched to LTC. I am still receiving affiliate payments in BTC, I pay my employees in BTC. But the safety of the code goes against the safety of "what is bitcoin". The stalemate is playing with either fork or flippenng to alts. It is only rational to conclude that it does not matter if users who try to do this are irrational. Something has to be sacrificed. Maybe it should not be that much. But if you refuse to play the political games from the beginning, ~~you will have to~~ someone will sacrifice much more.
I understand and I trust you because of the agnostic approach. It is a sign of the good heart. But life is not that simple sadly. Sometimes one must do the moderately evil things to push the good ones. Maybe you saw/read Trigun. I hate spoilers. But it is about a good guy - a gunman - who solves any situation without killing. He lets live even the worst villains with slogan "Love and peace". But as the story goes he realizes in the second to last episode, that he must kill. He does it and breaks up, because he breaks his own rule. But then there is the last episode, where he has to kill again and he is able to do it and actually he gets his shit together by that. I hope this is not infantile too much.
You need help. What else should I do then hodl BTC, buy shitcoins, sell and hodl more? Pay my emplyees in BTC. I have a new project - and no it is not a coffee (more in PM) - and I really need ppl to pay anonymously 1, 2, 10 USD. But if they have to pay that much in fees and I have to pay a lot to collect it from small wallets, then it loses the magic. Read my PM. I want to support BTC with all my power, but I can not do it more.
I know what is it to test the code. I know how precise it has to be if it is about money. It is beyond my imagination if The Money itself is the code. But guys... this situation of many months of stalemate was predictable and the agnostic approach here does not help.

By orders of magnitude not the same. But no problem, in the end bitcoin will go higher and Satoshi has no ambitions to spend.

The difference between gold and bitcoin also is that you can mine just 1800/900/450/225... bitcoins per day regardless of price. You can mine gold from seawater if price goes over 1M/ounce and this way the value of gold is always pushed down.

That is just a detail, also the halvings should last twice as long.
But the POS newly staked coins are also not existing. I do not see why it is impossible to replace mining by staking because of nonexistent inflation. The inflation by btc exists, it is just getting smaller. It is called disinflation.

Probably from reddit.
Money is a symbol with dual substance.
Money itself indeed is not backed by anything. Value of certain fiat money can disappear as steam and sometimes it does. After all the same can happen by the value of the cryptomoney. So both camps (fiat/nonfiat) accuse the other camp, that their currency is pure unbacked shit.
But the whole existence of money is backed as you say by commodities. But not only but by them. By all economic output that is being used for exchange. The *need* of the exchange is the backing.
So here all the restrictions by states are the true help to cryptos. If state can now restrict certain moneyflows, like to gambling or buying weed and so on, then this market needs still money. And that money is backed by that market.
Bitcoin can thank to paternal states as much as to Satoshi Nakamoto.

What is bullshit exactly? You can not take power from state and keep paying taxes and finance with them the police forces that go after you. Also US is getting power from having monopoly over many areas, including printing the most powerful fiat currency and from that currency they finance their international policy (=wars).
If I were him, I would say the same. Just I would not call for banning bitcoin because it is impossible and rather threw the towel in.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:54:32
Exactly. US tourists tend to idealize Europe from my experience.

2) 3) highly questionable
Miners need the worst energy, not solar, not wind, not some flares. Miners have to be switched on 24 hours a day.
It is irrelevant, how many times more something else consumes tahn  bitcoin. Bitcoin is an easy target.
Honestly I think what saves BTC will be ban on mining -&gt; higher price of energy that will be used for mining (from people who will go around the ban at high costs). But this is nothing that can be taken out lightly.

It is a mental thing. For generations. My mother still watches TV, even when she has computer, connection and she knows that all the programs she can watch at the computer, skip, has more options etc.
Or why the hell US people still use the checks..

I am not sure. There is no product that is even roughly the same over the century, so considering "perfect money" that will be able to survive centuries is a bit too much. And useless if we are not central banks. That was my point. I do not think it was his point.

I was just going by train trough a poor quarter in a moderately poor European state. 3 gypsies with fake gold necklaces and adidas sweatshirts jumped in and sat close to me.
I was just checking btc price, but somehow heard few words that they exchanged.
I swear they said "1 bitcoin...1 bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:42:05
I do not think they ran out, but it either does not pay off or they achieved the goal.
I hope for the first because the FUD and talks about flippening were high, so they got scared, bc they for sure have high stakes on btc.
But if they achieved the goal, I am curious what it was.
I heard theories that it were storj transactions, but nobody explained to me how it was supposed to work.

Politicians seize the power.
The smartest people rarely win. It is the most complex people.
I do understand you do not care what happens with the code.
But still it is horrible when you come with probably a great coode like Segwit and it is implemented on shitcoins only.
To play the agnostic pose is maybe great for ego. But it is important to deliver it.
You do not give a shit, but the other people come with the blockstream corp. AXA bullshit. You are cypherpunks right? You do not give a shit, right. But you are doing fucking autistic mistake here, if you think it does not matter. It does. Because there are millions of confused people, most of them semiretarded. And they listen to psychopaths... in other words to people who give a shit and who want their ideas going through, just because they are their ideas (or it is about something so low as money).
Being agnostic is great. It is a great idea. But as any idea of the world, when it is taken too seriously and orthodoxically, it is deadly. For God's sake take some LSD or something like that.

What people are missing is that bitcoin can not use &gt; 100% of human energy. It can actually use much less. Indeed new power plants can be made, but it takes time. Nuclear plant takes about 10 years to be completed from project for example. Bitcoin mining needs stable flows of energy, not some cheap wind or solar power plants. Even if it were true (or if we come with fusion for example), then the price of mining BTC would be much lower, so no incentive for price.
I think we will move after this halving a lot but afterwards the price hike will be limited 2x each 4 years. It is not so bad still.
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:39:13
I agree. Stratis might be interesting. I invested just a bit... now it is quite a lot, waiting for masternodes and tumblebit. If any Segwit will be ever live, Stratis has (also) a potential to help for BTC.

I do not think there will be evidence towards J****. But it makes sense.
What only bothers me here is why it stopped now. They take Segwit2x as a lock?

I do not think ppl abandon bitcoin, because there are still the pro-democracy ideologists. And man... give them some credit. Even they are doing some PR.
In the end the greed indeed is what counts, so it really does not matter what we write here or not.

Again: I do not care about fees to determine spam.
Spam has the only purpose: to disrupt the network. This is not a trial, so there is no need to have evidence that is indeed impossible to ever obtain.
I for example never said that spam is a grave sin. Like asicboost (if it exists), it is just an attempt to max the revenue. It is something that someone or some small group of bitcoin miners/users uses for their advantage. And the majority just pays for that.
And the majority can call it spam and can defend. As customer I do not give a shit, because I do few transactions per month. As potential developer of one project that needs small payments and btc hodler at once I care a lot about the spam = people who pay the fees to get even more from the fees back (and maybe from some shorting on the top).

Marketing is not a dead profession. Look at ICOs. ICOs are product of marketing. They do pretty well.
If you do not do marketing, then the ones who do jump over you. WOM is nice, but not everything. Pinnacle has the best reputation between gamblers, they have the WOM, but they did not progress.
Clerks are also needed etc.
It is your wishful thinking that the world will work like that. But marketing vs. WOM game does not change with blockchain. People are stupid, gamblers are even more stupid than average and this will not change. People need and want to be told lies and they pay for that.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:45:44
That is true. But maybe those who do not list it should at least pay it out. Would be really nice if you have a section dedicated to the exchanges policies. Or sub-reddit. If I find something out I will PM you.
