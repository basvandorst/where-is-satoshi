ELI5. When will bitcoin utilize lightning? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:25
Yes, but we're up 31% in the last 24 hours. That's not normal. That's bubble territory. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:25:53
Stop looking at the 5 minute chart and pull back to the 1 hour. Hell, try the 1 day chart while you're at it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:16:20
Go go go go go!

If they wanted to be transparent and act as a neutral exchange, they would:
1) Announce BCash trading on a specific day
2) Give everyone their coins 
3) Allow the market to decide what to do and let people price in this news. 
By keeping it a "secret" and telling people not inside trade, it's creating perfect scenarios of insider trading. Coinbase fucked up and is trying to spin this story. They're going on an internal witch hunt even though the CEO is in on the action. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:23:31
oh is that what the little dots meant...
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:48:11
The dip was on the 30th and on the 3rd. You got to jump on the opportunity when it presents itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:47
Safe? No. 
Legit? Sure. 
Enable margin trading on GDAX. Sell all your bitcoins. Margin trade sell more bitcoins than you can afford at current price. Set stop buy order at lower price. 
Does that sound scary? Yeah, that's basically shorting Bitcoin.

It'll go up, it'll go down, it'll go sideways. 
Just HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:50:57
what about the time it went from 30 dollars to 2? Or the time it went from 250 to like 30 You probably weren't around for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:06:05
You're a couple minutes early but we'll let it slide. BTC is ready to take off!
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:28:43
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:39:17
What's not predictable? Bitcoin is on an everlasting run to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:07
It certainly is "doing it again"
$17,400 and rising fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:53
Nah, just sell a portion and sit on the rest. Selling a little bit makes you feel better but you're still HODL'n
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:22
If we do end up getting an ETF for Bitcoin, then we're literally going to the moon. Imagine billions going into these funds actually pulling coins out of circulation.
How long does it take to get approval from the SEC and implementation for such a fund? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:10:53
Brace for impact boys. We're about to hit the wall!
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:24:39
Man you need to get out of that shitcoin. Put the rest into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:01:10
My god...
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:44:12
lol it was apparently a prank at the end...
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:48:27
Relax boys. Bitfinex is still creeping up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:51:25
The bubble seems to be going strong over there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:04
It's 1.5k lower because you can't deposit any USD into that exchange from the US. That's why there's no one buying on that exchange. Thus it's a lower price. 
On the flip side on Bithumb, the koreans are crazy into it and dumping their life savings into bitcoin so its 2k to 3k more expensive. 
GDAX is actually the most accurate exchange since it's got the most liquidity of the top 3. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:11
Ah, I think you're right. They did announce CASH SETTLED futures so that would mean that there shouldn't be any exchange of bitcoins. Most likely, it's just going to be publicity and containing BTC volatility for better or for worse. 
I can see more of those wallstreet guys bet against BTC and constraining the potential price growth. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:03:36
That noise you're hearing is bitcoin breaking the space time continuum sucking in all the value out of your altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:10:21
I guess the part about stabilization of price was real? 
Still not the volume part though...
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:40




That analysis assumes that everything is going to continue under the same assumptions. CME coming online in the next couple weeks is NOT the same. I bet you that will have an effect. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:28:32
There's actually more truth in this than many think. Hell, states can flat out ignore federal law and pass their own laws such as Marajuana legalization. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:18:05
The slide, followed by the recovery!
Love how predicable bitcoin is. :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:06:16
Kind of tame tbh. I thought these guys would be all about making more money...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:03
I'm waiting for 20K and then I'm selling about 15% of my coins and sit on the rest through the end of the year. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:55
Now why would you want that? 
We had our scare and we already shook loose all the weak hands. It's time to go up again. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:13:37
That's my problem too. I'll end up panic buying more than I can afford. :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:00:12
GDAX is ready to take off. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:27:56
Bitfinex is not used by the United States. They do not allow USA residents to trade on their platform. If you want to watch the "USA" trading, then watch GDAX. 
The prices arena the 14,000 because a lot of new users got on board and are scared after the drop. That's all. We'll go back up soon enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:25:52
Looking at my bitcoin wallet transaction, I'd probably be a bitcoin millionaire too if I had just kept everything that went in and out of my wallet. Still, I've got a job now and I'm buying myself back into the market at a fraction of the coins I used to own. 
Perhaps your brother lost his coins in the Mt Gox hack back in 2013/2014. That sounds right around the time when everything went down :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:02:47
Prices and and Korean sentiment seems to be on a whole different level compared to the rest of the world. They're over $1400 dollars above bitfinex at $13,231. I understand that their market is tied to the Won and a lot more closed off than the other markets so it's natural for some price differences but it just seems like they're pulling ahead of us more and more. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:41:56
Only if you can read korean and own korean bank accounts. There's a reason why the korean market is so closed off in their own little word.  They're effectively a closed ecosystem. Same with Bitfinex with no USD deposits. GDAX is the only big exchange that is truly global. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:13:34
Precisely. That's why we need them think it didn't crash and invest more monies into BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:04:33




Bitcoin has had three bubbles in its history with 10x rises and 80% crashes every time. When you go to $1000 in days and then eventually crash to $200, that's called a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:21
Probably just a lag of market sell orders that were meant for 19,500 XD
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:13:29
GDAX froze for a second and the next thing we know it's $1369
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:10:39
There is risk in gambling. There is risk in bitcoin. Not going to dispute what he's saying about the gambling or the angry bitcoin mob.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:48:10
Personally, after hearing a friend say this one out loud, I think I like it the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:27:54
Strap in boys. Next stop, the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:55:56
For most it's not an issue as people are paid as they mine so users wouldn't have lost much.
Nicehash on the other hand may be in for a rough time...
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:42:59
HODL :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:08:15
Thats really tame tbh. we could be at 18600 by morning at this rate.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:19:57
Why not
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:04:47
Look, we're HODL'n but to say nothing happened today is just ignoring current events. Bitcoin dropped to 14K, down from a high of 19,800. That is a substantial drop. Coinbase, the biggest exchange for new users just listed Bitcoin Cash right next to Bitcoin. This will cause confusion and give Bitcoin Cash more unwanted limelight. 
Sure bitcoin will rebound but I suspect Bitcoin Cash will slowly eat into potential Bitcoin gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:46:21
19k while you're at it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:01:47
This is at least a few days old. 
No big deal. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:04:30
nope. I went all in at $5000 and haven't had a penny more to put in since then 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:14:57
This looks like an Coinbase internal investigation led by the Bcash supporting CEO. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:39:26
are you kidding me. fuck bitpay.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:43:57
We can call it E-Coin but you know what china's going to turn around and adopt.
Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:24:32
I really don't think Korea is the cause for the dip. 
Korea is very insulated from the rest of the bitcoin world in that their exchanges and the other exchanges have very low liquidity. Sure there's massive volume in Korea but did you ever notice that Korea has generally ignored the worldwide price and has been 2 to 3 thousand dollars higher than the rest of the world? That's because to trade on Korea exchanges, you have to be Korean and have a Korean bank account. 
On the other hand, if you notice GDAX and Bitfinex are generally the exchanges that lead the drops on the exchanges. GDAX is especially volatile because you have all these new users who bought in at the end of the last rally at high cost basis and the newest users always have the weakest hands. Coinbase / GDAX is the most user-friendly exchange for new users too. The combination has caused GDAX to lead the massive selloff because new users get scared too easily. 
To be honest, the pull back and double bottom wasn't a surprise if you were in the United States and have been following the exchanges and the user sentiment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:19
Not yet damn it. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:03:19
Something about this one really just makes me smile. It's funny how we all relate this clip to 10k and it's stuck with all of us. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:58
I bought in at $9750 and again at $9150 riding it down. 
These n00b investors are spooked by a small price drop ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:12:15
You got yourself a brisket baby.

He's the one who says the famous "It's over 9000"

I literally ready that as “buy any bitc*”.  ��
