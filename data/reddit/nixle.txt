No, I don't remember that, but it sounds fascinating. Care to tell me more about the taxation of Salt? It seems like a funny anecdote. 
[edit] I can't believe how sarcastic the about sounds, but I really do mean it. Tell me more
[edit2] I can't help sounding sarcastic, but please believe me, I am very much interested in the whole salt thing

Kraken is great. They have $30k  worth of btc on hold for me for 2 days, but I'm not worried. They'll sort it out. &lt;3 kraken.

Over the years, a lot of my coins have gone through Gox. I've really respected them a lot longer than most here. However, not being able to get fiat out was kinda a dealbreaker for me so I switched to Kraken, which now holds way to many of my coins and euro's. 
History repeats.

I've traded on all the big exchanges. Kraken is the most reliable in my book. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. My last deposit took 4 days because I exceeded my limit. Their customer service was a bit slow, but all was well in the end. This was 1 week ago.

I've recently switched from Apple and their childish phones to Android and love it. But lets not kid ourselves here: google is just as evil and has been clamping down on the "openess" of Android for a while now. 
Yes, we can sideload .apk files and bypass the playstore, but how many people will understand that when Google goes all "Apple" and starts banning bitcoin apps?
Won't happen? Just this week there was a big story on Google banning a large 1mil+ downloads app for not using the Google payment system for IAP's.
If you really want make a change, maybe switch to firefox OS or sailfish. (Not that I will, not until Google derails this thing)

I am an early adoptor. I've got a bunch of Bitcoin. But yesterday was the first time I really thought "Ok, this is really bad, let's sell" and I sold about 1% on Kraken. Now I have a bunch of money in my account, more than I ever had and I can't stop thinking how stupid I am. 
Where is my undying loyalty to Bitcoin? When did I stop believing? I've been preaching Bitcoin to everybody that (didn't) want to hear. Yet here I am selling for personal profit. 
I make me feel sick.

Is this the kind of fix that requires 51% of the network to adapt it before it is considered "fixed" ? Because updating 51% of the clients out there seems a terrible ordeal at this time. 
On the otherhand, when the chain forked a year ago, that seemed fixed fast enough...

Man, Starfox 64 was a great game. This man is a god among men. Fun fact! In Europe, the game was called "Lylat Wars" because a German company was already names "StarVox" and Nintendo wanted to avoid a launch-delay and possible lawsuit.

They're doing a great job in my opinion. I wouldn't trust any party with this kind of (my) money if they weren't anal about verification. This is not a bad thing. 
As a developer, I'd like to see more API. 
As a Bitcoin enthusiast I would like to see more low-level explanation about Bitcoin (more video's) to make it easier for n00bs to get started/interested. I think that this is part of the responsibility that comes with running the biggest Bitcoin marketplace. 
Also, more updates and blogs about what Mt. Gox is up to, views on the market. Stuff like that. Create some followers, get people involved.

My data directory is not the default one, I have to run bitcoin via 1 specific shortcut or it will load/create a wrong wallet.dat. 
Couple of days ago I updated the client, forgot about the shortcut, and actually saw a 0 btc balance. The weirdest shock went through my head. It really was like a rush of panic/adrenaline, I can imagine could result in a heart attack if I were, say, a 80 year old. 
So yeah, I know how you feel :)
@_date: 2012-01-29 19:06:55

I think it is awesome to see how the bottleneck of this economy  is shifted in the right direction after every crisis. "Bitcoin finds a way" is how I look at it. 
Example: the bottleneck of not getting any rewards from mining because of difficulty : the creation of mining pools. 
Example: the problem of Deepbit.net getting to large : people moved away and started more pools.
Example:  the blockchain fork : we all handled this as adults
Example: Mt.gox being the only exchange couldn't really handle any serious traffic : the creation of more exchanges. 
And now we have streamlined the entire processes from mining to trade up until converting to fiat. The limitation in this case actually being on the side of fiat. 
I think we're proving that this unregulated market provides us with the right stimuli to make this work.

My first reaction would be: yes, obviously the real DPR is too smart for any of this. I want to believe this. 
But if I look at the past, usually these kind of "masterminds" are more lucky than smart. When the whole story gets out, I'm usually disappointed. 
I'm scared this too will probably turn out to be more a story of more FBI / government incompetence than a cunning mastermind.

Bitcoin seems the most likely to have any significance on the time scale they are proposing. 
2025 is just around the corner, I doubt we'll see any of these have a huge impact on our daily lives.
11 years is just enough time to have a couple of iteration, maybe even an innovation, of existing tech. Nothing revolutionary is going to hit the market in this timescale.

Mine was kinda f-'ed when I got it a few months back. But I unscrewed the casing and put the fan in upside down. Don't re-assemble the case.

I don't know. A lot of my clients still use it, but hasn't it been on version 1.x for 10 years now? The code is pretty dated, too much queries if you ask me. 
Version 2.0 was promised in 2007. 
However, I still think it is great that this was released. With so many Zen-cart sites out there (thousands? Tens of thousand?) the platform offers a great oppertunity for Bitcoin adoptation.

Well, buying coins with Paypal is probably safe, selling them with Paypal is a bad idea. So don't worry too much about that. 
I use bitstamp for Bitcoin and BTC-E for litecoin. No bad expierences with those. 
Also don't stress too much about the price going up or down. In my expierence, it will go up and down for ever. So it'll probably hit $100 some day and $5000 some day. Looks like you're still "in" on time. ;)
Mt.Gox is too blame for pretty much everytime the price has gone down. Be it a hack, server issues or just being stupid. Right now, they're not giving out Bitcons OR dollars, so it's not really an exchange anymore.

Since Bitcoin is opensource, everybody can make a copy and change the rules. If you can get enough people to help you out and get it started, you can have your own cryptocurrency. Litecoin is one of many. 
In my opinion, these "alt-coins" exist mostly out of curiosity for the protocol and the tech. A curious developer thinks "would this work, let's try it". But also, more and more to try go "get rich quick". 
Litecoin is marketed by it's community as the "silver to Bitcoin Gold". And it works, because it's up $4.00 I believe. Probably going to $9 I think.

You are looking at it all wrong. 
Let's compare to apples, because apple's are healthy and tasty! 
You give me $5 and we agree that I send you 5 apples. I put the apples in an envelope and mail then to you, you put the money in an envelope and mail it to me. 
While the apples are underway, something big happens. A CNN report informs everybody in the world that Apples are healthy, tasty and colerful! Oh no! Everybody now wants to have apples. The price for Apples doubles! 
A few days later, your apples arrive in the mail. 
What, children, is now the value of these 5 Apples? 
Homework: Replace "Apples" with "Bitcoin" and replace "healty" with "awesome".
Good luck! &lt;3

Maybe it is different for your country, but over here, all that comes into my business account above a certain amount will be taxable. I think. 
I have great people running the financials, but I doubt they'll be very keen on the idea of setting up an exchange. 
(this is where my English falls shorts, don't know the termonlogy) But I can subtract the taxes I pay for products myself from the revenue taxes. 
I can also subtract my expenses from the income and lower to total amount of taxable income. But in the end, there is a whole lot of money coming into my account that will just be plain simple taxable.

Paying for any kind of digital good or service from anywhere or paying my freelancers from India and China in BTC. That's where it's at. To me.

To answer some of your questions:
Giving free coins: you can tip a fellow redditor a few dollars, yes. 
Wallets: Bitcoin-QT is the most up to date wallet I believe. I consider it secure enough to have a few BTC in there. 
Mining is pointless nomatter how big a miner your bring to the scene. You'd better buy a few coins directly and not waste your time. 
Anything else?
Some extra free advise:
Don't use Mt Gox.
Don't use Paypal for buying coins.
Don't buy coins on eBay.
Don't keep your coins in an on-line wallet too long.
Only use services that offer 2-factor authentication.
You don't have to buy an entire Bitcoin. Start with 0.0001 and learn how to use it. 
Learn how to keep your coins on an off-line computer for maximum security.

I think it would be "more" fair it this features is only implemented to coins that are mined AFTER this features has been implemented. Meaning: the coins from before 2014 will stay where they are, forever. 
This thing could really disrupt the entire ecosystem. Imagine 50 years of Bitcoin economy and mining as it is and after one day.. BAM.. thousands of coins become available again.

I think Litecoin is important for the adaptation of Cryptocurrency in general. If you don't like Bitcoin, try some other flavor, but at least get involved in the revolution. 
Also, the price is much lower and I've spoken to a lot of people that do invest in Litecoin because they feel like the Bitcoin boat has sailed. Now, true or false, it doesn't matter. It has gotten these people involved in the revolution.

Used to be because there was no way of getting money out of GOX, the only way was to spend it on Bitcoins and transfer the Bitcoins out. This really screws up the balance of the marketplace.

Storage and bandwidth are subject to "inflation" though. A 1MB download was really something 10 years ago. How outdated will Bitcoin be 50 years from now? Download the entire blockchain in a second. Then wat? 
 I think some adjustment to storage and bandwidth "inflation" is not bad. Though I completly agree that everything must be done to keep the freedom and integrety of Bitcoin. If there is no suitable concensus between the devs who really know what they are talking about, I think we should just let it be as it is.
