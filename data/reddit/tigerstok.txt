All addresses are private public key pairs.
There is no registration required for addresses, I can send Bitcoin to any address. The paper wallet has a private public key pair, and anyone can send Bitcoin to the public key on the paper wallet.

The high rates are due to miner fees, you will have to pay fees to transfer the Bitcoin to the new account anyway.

Only service that allows credit card, and almost any amount instantly and in any area.
The other ones seem to be trying very hard to make their service not work.

Blockchain.info (I think) uses a distributed hash table so that they can't see what adresses your wallet has. The identifier is a way to fibd the wallet.

Bitcoin unlimited allows for larger blocks, and therefore lower fees because data doesn't cost so much. Bitcoin has the ability to run months behind because mining is only a way to defend agaibst malicious attacks and spam.

All transactions on the blockchain are public. However, the blockchain can't see inside your enceyptes wallet, or see your private key. All transactions are encrypted with your private key, and anyone can decrypt it.
Private key encryption is only for confirmation, not privacy.

The blockchain does not keep information on where a transaction came from. Also that needs to happen for a transaction to be sigbed is a private key. If I hacked into your computer and found your private keys, I have access to your bitcoins.

The large block size is hard to deal with on old processors with smaller memory.
And it allows the person who kibed the empty block to nominate their own block.

You can either transfer them to another wallet, or find the private key for the wallet.

Online accounts (exept blockchain.info) have the ability to see your private keys and adresses, which can be used to steal your Bitcoin or track you.
