There is no reason not to run a full node and use it as your wallet if you don't mind the synchronization. Once it is synced, it is super easy to keep up with the blockchain unless you have an abnormally bad Internet connection or hardware.

I think people who use faucets to get Bitcoin these days are guaranteed to own so little of it that they aren't worth exploiting.
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:03:13
There is nothing inevitable about people still wanting to use Bitcoin when transactions are maxed out and they have to pay higher fees. That sort of disruptive event can just as easily end the growth of Bitcoin once and for all. Perhaps another cryptocurrency can arise or perhaps the entire experiment will have failed. Small-blockers seem to take for granted the yet unproven idea that people will embrace Bitcoin no matter how difficult you make it, before most people have even tried it.

I watched livestream from the Scaling Bitcoin conference last night where Peter Todd said he wants zero increase to the block size limit for at least five years. The reasons given were unconvincing and go against what the miners and almost everyone else says. If he really has the power to veto any increase, it is a real problem for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:32:33
Wow, then the situation is even more dire than I thought. It is so bad that it is almost good, because with no hard fork on the horizon there will almost certainly be so much disruption that some sort of alternative to Core will come out of it.
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:44:53
It is 42 gallons.
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:08:57
Why can't the small-blockers just content themselves with an altcoin if they want to stay small and ensure their political independence? It seems Litecoin could serve this purpose just fine, and then Bitcoin could be free to scale. That may or may not work out well for Bitcoin, but at least we should try. You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs and there are limits to how risk-averse we should be if we want to change the world.
The other side will likewise tell us who support big blocks to go away and make an altcoin, and that is fair enough, but they have less to lose by sticking to an altcoin, since those are closer to their ideal coin already and any attempt to make a mass-adopted altcoin is likely to fail.
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:36:35
The point of increasing capacity is not more use cases, but to be taken seriously at all. You can't do anything more with a network that is already maxed out. It is looking pretty hopeless, but any increase is better than nothing.
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:43:41
The cost of running a node is the least persuasive argument, because I run a full node myself so I know how trivial the cost is. My Internet connection is below average for my country, and yet I know I could easily handle 8MB blocks and probably up to 100MB before I would have to upgrade my bandwidth. Storage is also trivial, even without pruning.
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:10:41
If you haven't sold the BTC yet, you haven't realized any gains, so I don't understand the problem.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:43:06
So in 8000 years, this plan will even catch up with BIP101? Or is the increase intended to stop at some point?
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:38:01
No, it isn't. It is a fundamental scaling issue. Imagine if McDonald's had decided that they would only open one restaurant, but they still had ambitions of being a household name and a great investment. That is the sort of delusion small-blockers believe in.
You have to convince people that they want to participate in Bitcoin before something like a fee market can work, and Bitcoin hasn't done that yet. In short, Bitcoin still needs users more than users need Bitcoin, so we should make it as easy as possible for them to adopt it. Only later when and if we run into actual technical limitations should transactions be restricted.
@_date: 2015-12-23 14:08:19
The elephant in the room is the refusal to allow bigger blocks. Transaction fees will never be able to sustain mining in the long run unless we allow a huge number of transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:07:33
A good analogy, except there was no one actively opposing efforts to deal with the Y2K problem. Bitcoin is not so lucky, since we have people opposing a fix for ideological reasons.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:05:59
Probably a good idea to sell, because when the decision not to scale gets priced into the price, Bitcoin will likely be worth much less.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:06:18
Even the Chinese miners have said they can deal with 8 MB. 2 MB is obviously too low unless the growth rate of Bitcoin transactions slows down to almost zero.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:23:00
With good backup routines, you shouldn't have to stop running Bitcoin Core even with this issue and a much larger blockchain. Just restore your data directory from backup instead and resync the blockchain from there. But it would be nice to get this fixed. I have the same issue sometimes with Windows 7, but not Linux. After a system crash or unexpected power outage, Bitcoin Core sometimes needs to reindex all the blocks from disk in Windows, but never while running Linux, in my experience. Also, I think the problem first appeared with 10.0.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:25:25
With 8 MB, we can avoid filling up the blocks for a few more years, which will help Bitcoin become better established as a cheap and easy payment alternative. With 2 MB there is a greater risk that Bitcoin will just die on the vine.
@_date: 2015-06-14 01:20:50
I don't believe Bitcoin will become a centrally administered system because of this hard fork. The plan is just to leave behind a needless limitation that the majority already wants to be gone anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:52:06
Okay, maybe ignoring the strongest chain is going too far. Hopefully it won't be needed anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:07:53
20 MB is much better, what is really needed is dynamic scaling to allow mass adoption if and when Bitcoin becomes really successful. I like this proposal:
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:58:19
I know there are also drawbacks of larger blocks, which is why I can accept the VERY conservative jump to 8 MB plus one more yearly. 2 MB is just ridiculously low.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:50:37
You are right, there is no way to handle any significant growth with such a tiny blocksize. The small-blockers are literally willing to stop Bitcoin from becoming commonly used because they care more about other ideals than growth, and they believe those ideals are fundamentally threatened by bigger blocks. That is why this situation is so horribly damaging and probably won't end well.
@_date: 2015-06-14 01:35:58
But the checkpointing would only happen after it has been approved by the economic majority, though not necessarily the biggest miners, and it would only happen once, for one purpose. It's not like we give Mike Hearn the power to make any changes he wants beyond this.
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:53:42
I am not telling others what to do. Of course everyone is free to run whatever software they want. I just don't understand why one side would want to cripple Bitcoin and go through this whole controversy in order to achieve a result much like an altcoin that never goes anywhere, since that sort of thing already exists.
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:14:15
Thanks for telling it like it is. I am also coming to terms with the fact that Bitcoin is a failed experiment. It can't scale, not for technical reasons, but because there will always be people who are willing and able to throw sand in the gears and prevent the needed changes (we can fork, but that will just produce another irrelevant altcoin). The opposition is puzzling in the extreme, since it also ensures that their own bitcoins will never be worth very much, but that's the way it goes.
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:13:51
Is segregated witness really all we can get? Does this mean Jeff Garzik's 2MB proposal is not moving forward?
@_date: 2015-12-10 05:41:41
Are you really not familiar with the block size controversy and all the censorship of arguments for bigger blocks? Initially when I saw the Core devs trying to prove that Craig Wright is a false Satoshi, their arguments seemed convincing, but in light of Wright's advocacy for extreme scaling which even included simulations on a supercomputer with "340 Gb blocks" if these tweets are to be believed, I am less certain. I know this issue can't be honestly discussed, so extreme skepticism is called for.
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:11:17
If checkpointing is needed to get bigger blocks, then so be it. We need to do whatever it takes, because Bitcoin simply isn't interesting if it remains crippled.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:23:46
Let's get this fixed, preferably with dynamic increases, and then we can all party like it's 1999. It's hard to appreciate Bitcoin until this issue is resolved.
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:10:55
I have learned from this block size controversy that Bitcoin can only scale very slowly, if at all. This means that Bitcoin is probably also overvalued as an investment, because it will have to take a very long time to reach its potential, longer than most people realize. And in the meantime, there will probably be major crises in the fiat money system, long before Bitcoin is ready to step in as an alternative. Sadly, Bitcoin appears to be too little, too late.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:06:16
Increasing the block size is not about doing more things with Bitcoin, but allowing more people to use Bitcoin. It will not affect the max size of transactions, just the number. Even if you just want Bitcoin to be a currency, don't you think it would be a good idea to let more than one in 16,000 people use it every day? Because that's what 1MB blocks amount to. About half a million possible daily transactions for seven billion people in the world.
@_date: 2015-06-05 10:28:08
Why did they get rid of the internal miner's hashmeter?
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:25:51
This is a great discussion of why bigger blocks are needed. Even though only one side of the debate was interviewed, anyone who listens to this must understand that we need to go through with this hard fork. Mike Hearn used the word delusional about the opposing side, and there is really no nicer way to put it.
Bitcoin will lose all credibility as an investment or anything useful if we don't increase the blocksize limit soon. It won't even be useful as a niche service because nodes have no good way to deal with memory overflow. You can't have a system that anyone can use without permission and then not know what do with all the transactions if people actually start using it in great numbers.
@_date: 2015-12-10 01:23:32
Whoever he is, he seems to be a strong supporter of big blocks. Which means the Core developers would denounce him even if he really was Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:51:15
I am not really worried about those extremes, but two megabytes plus one more each year is not enough for Bitcoin to grow when we need it to. Maybe if this scheme had been implemented from the beginning it would have been OK, which means we at least need to jump to 8 megabytes now.
@_date: 2014-12-20 18:28:46
I for one would still run a full node if blocks were 100 MB each. And I think I could afford it too, because that would also mean bitcoin would be worth much more, so you just have to set aside a small amount now to pay for storage and network speed if Bitcoin ever becomes that popular. It is incredibly harebrained to want Bitcoin to stay limited to 1 or even 10 MB blocks, because that means it can't be taken seriously as a contender to any kind of meaningful payment system and we have willingly failed before we even tried.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:08:14
This whole debate is such a mess. Bitcoin is obviously not viable as a serious payment system without bigger blocks, but the process of changing it threatens to break it apart. Block size scaling should have been built in from the start, and now it may be too late because nobody can agree on anything.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:33:55
But the only way it will be attractive to ride on the Bitcoin network is if lots of people are doing it. It is naive to expect people to pay a high ticket price to ride in such a minor league as Bitcoin will be in without bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:34:51
Bitcoin in its current form is like building the greatest race car ever and then limiting its top speed to one mile per hour. The funniest part is all the fans who like this limitation just fine and argue that going any faster is too dangerous. I really hope they can be convinced, because otherwise Bitcoin will remain designed to lose and be irrelevant or surpassed by more rational coins.
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:04:43
I agree with this as well. The opposition to bigger blocks feels like a betrayal of the principles of Bitcoin that attracted me in the first place, which always assumed scalability. Without increasing the block size, Bitcoin won't even be elitist. It will just be irrelevant and there is no point in being involved anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:33:49
Most people are not convinced that Bitcoin is superior to gold yet, or good for much of anything besides buying drugs and speculative bubbles, really. So why would it be "monetized enormously" at current usage levels (or at most 2x growth with the current block size limit)? We need to convince people that Bitcoin is useful before they will want to buy and use it as a store of value and so on. Bitcoin hasn't proven itself yet as far as most people are concerned, and the 1MB block size limit ensures that it never will. I for one will not want to be invested in Bitcoin without knowing we can get past this hurdle.
@_date: 2015-05-06 10:14:47
There are too many Luddites in the Bitcoin movement.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:37:19
Your medical analogy has a major weakness. We know that perfect health is possible without medical intervention and most of the time, symptoms of illness turn out to be not very serious and resolve on their own without invasive procedures. Bitcoin is very different. We know for a fact that Bitcoin cannot be the payment system we want without bigger blocks. Doing nothing is not comparable at all to doing nothing about medical symptoms, because Bitcoin in its present form simply does not have the genetic ability to be healthy if people try to adopt it in any significant numbers.
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:41:52
Bitcoin is not useful even for that if it is overvalued. How many will sell all their bitcoin when they realize it doesn't have growth potential? I have a feeling we are headed for a crisis now because of the block size limit in one way or another, and by the time the dust settles, Bitcoin might not be the dominant cryptocurrency anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-28 10:57:39
Bitcoin's value as a "collectible" derives from the size of the network (or expectation of growth) along with the limit of 21 million coins, not a low block size limit. Limiting the number of transactions will not add value; in fact it will do precisely the opposite. Digital scarcity in itself is not valuable, since any altcoin can do that. Who would want to collect something with almost no utility?
At this point, we just have to admit that Bitcoin needs users more than users need Bitcoin. Making it harder to use Bitcoin will not attract users, and without much larger adoption, Bitcoin will never amount to much. It is incredibly harebrained to think people will pay high transaction fees to use such a marginal payment system as it will have to remain with one megabyte blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:45:44
Good analogy, which also goes to show how unrealistic it is to expect alignment. The two factions in Bitcoin are really that irreconcilably different.
I didn't realize this either when I got into Bitcoin years ago. I thought we all shared Satoshi's vision of a peer-to-peer payment system, and was shocked when I realized that more powerful forces want to keep Bitcoin as a settlement layer only. There will be no consensus and most likely the entire project will fail because of internecine strife.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:22:36
I think the small-blockers will win this fight, but it will be a Pyrrhic victory because it will make Bitcoin practically defunct. I predict that the 1MB blocks will never even be filled with legitimate transactions because users will leave Bitcoin behind out of disgust with the limit before we get there.
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:24:34
Does anyone know if this applies to Ethereum as well? Is it really useless and possibly also a scam, despite its considerable market cap?
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:03:37
At 7 transactions per second, every person out of 7 billion in the world could complete a transaction once every one billion seconds or 31.7 years. That's just 2-3 transactions per lifetime. Bitcoin does obviously not even aspire to be a world currency. Cripplecoin, indeed.

I agree, Core could potentially regain control after a fork too. I just wish they would compromise ahead of any fork so we could avoid all the crap that is likely to happen now.

The title is misleading. The 2MB BIP will expire in 2018 if it doesn't get approval; but if it does, it will only take 1000 blocks plus 28 days to activate.

Perhaps paradoxically, the blockchain and blocks might have been smaller now without the blocksize limit, since there would be no reason to spam it to make a point. Then we could all have worked together and had a positive outlook instead of the internecine strife which is destroying the community.
@_date: 2016-01-20 08:39:06
Core can probably still avoid a hostile takeover just by giving us 2MB, so it is really amazing if they refuse to do so.
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:03:58

@_date: 2016-12-17 16:26:03
Checkpoints are already implemented to some extent. Blocks older than a couple of years or so are not verified as carefully as new ones when you start a new node.
It's hard to believe that you don't have enough bandwidth to run a node, unless you rely exclusively on mobile Internet. I have a crappy ADSL connection, and I don't even notice that my node is running. I think your problem is motivation, which will not be helped by keeping the blocks small. If it is true that most users need to run full nodes for Bitcoin to be viable, then it is already a lost cause, so what are the small-blockers really fighting for anyway?
@_date: 2016-12-17 12:41:12
If IBD time is the only remaining obstacle to bigger blocks, then that should be easy enough to solve. For example, bitcoiners could organize LAN parties to share the blockchain to new users. Public libraries and other institutions might also provide the blockchain through fast local networks to anyone interested.
Unless it grows to something ridiculous like petabyes, motivated users will always be able to get the blockchain. And those who aren't motivated don't bother to download it even today.
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:09:26
Kind of, though I don't think it scales back down dynamically (if we need smaller blocks again, this should be accomplished via soft forks). The only way we are going to get bigger blocks is to break consensus, so we might as well go for it (XT tolerates up to 25% dissent, meaning the hard fork will happen as long as at least 750 out of the last 1000 mined blocks agree to it).
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:59:41
I suppose we could have started with 2 MB and then 3 MB and so on, and maybe it would have been marginally better to make the increase happen only when blocks actually fill up, but all of this would have added more complexity and after months of debate without getting closer to consensus, you just have to draw the line somewhere and do something. Even the most bandwidth-constrained miners in China have said they can handle 8MB blocks, so that is a good place to start. And remember, miners can still mine smaller blocks if they want to.
Yes, you are just voting if you run Bitcoin XT for now; otherwise it functions just like Bitcoin Core and if we never get a supermajority, there will be no difference ever.
I forgot exactly how the doubling is determined, but it will be at least approximately every two years. Yes, this means the blockchain can potentially grow extremely large (it will take several years though) and it might become impractical or even impossible for new nodes to download and calculate the whole thing themselves. But pruning is already possible, so you don't need to keep much more than the unspent transaction set, and new nodes can start by just copying this from someone. This is inevitable if we want to allow Bitcoin to grow, and it isn't really a problem. Currently the UTXO takes up 1.22 GB on my disk while the entire Bitcoin data directory is 46.4 GB, and it is only the former that one strictly has to keep. It is hard to see the UTXO growing beyond the capability of home computers even with all these doublings. The Internet is already fast enough for the endpoint of Bitcoin's growth, but that speed is not evenly distributed yet. Maybe in 20 years it will be. We could always turn around and limit the block size again later, but right now the important thing is to allow Bitcoin to grow. And who knows if people even want to use it that much? I think it is important that at least the potential exists, so we should definitely make this fork happen.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:07:47
But the problem is that we have already discussed this to death, including numerous proposals for a dynamic block-size limit, and it only becomes clearer and clearer than we are never going to get consensus for any change at all because the ideologies of the two factions are fundamentally irreconcilable. Now XT is ready with a concrete way to scale up Bitcoin, and I think all of us who want bigger blocks should simply embrace it and hope it will win out.
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:07:05
I just downloaded it, and Chrome said "Bitcoin XT is not commonly downloaded and could be dangerous."
Let's make it common!
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:10:42
I am sorry to say you are naive for thinking you can get consensus. The ideological chasm runs deeper than you think, with a very stubborn minority who absolutely do not want to prepare for bigger blocks by any means you can conceive of.
The Satoshi clients will not accept larger blocks, but they should still relay smaller blocks from clients that allow larger blocks (but they will never build on the chain with larger blocks). Mike Hearn just wrote a good post about the meaning of forking:
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:04:55
If the fork happens, the maximum block size will first be increased to 8 megabytes and then automatically double every two years for twenty years. If you agree that this sounds good, you should help increase the XT node count by running a full node as well:
Test binaries are available there, and an official XT site will be up shortly.
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:23:58
That might be a good proposal and worth considering if it had been made earlier, but at this point we are so sick and tired of debating the block size limit that the thing to do is to quit debating and start using Bitcoin XT.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:07:26
Miners need to run Bitcoin XT or otherwise implement the changed protocol. Or at least 75% of them, known as a supermajority, before the fork will happen (this can happen in January 2016 at the earliest). Then hopefully the old Bitcoin network with smaller blocks will become irrelevant or disappear altogether, and we have successfully prepared Bitcoin for growing up.

They need to recapitalize the banks somehow before they can reopen. Unless someone is stupid enough to lend them more euros, it will probably have to be something like their old drachma.

Of course it won't be the official currency, but it could play a role.

I am not an expert, but the only potential security problem I have ever heard of regarding reuse of addresses is if you reuse an address that you have already spent from.

You just need a regular computer to run Bitcoin XT for now. It is very hard to find a PC too weak to run it; they certainly don't make them anymore.

More than 10,000 card transactions occur every second in the world. With 7 transactions per second, Bitcoin could claim up to a 0.07% market share. And that's just credit and debit cards, so it is actually much worse. I can't believe this is even being debated. Of course the block size limit needs to be increased by several orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:46:13
The bottleneck problem is not found on your machine, but in the protocol itself, which prohibits blocks larger than one megabyte. I know most of our hardware and Internet connections can easily handle hundreds or even thousands of times as many transactions, but that can do us no good as long as the block size limit remains tiny. I am already using Bitcoin XT in hopes of getting bigger blocks.

Are your dust inputs really unspendable though? Can't you try using the coin control feature of your Core client to send some of the inputs at a time (with a high enough fee)?
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:33:48
Off-chain transactions can easily avoid this issue. Worrying about solving this marginal and contrived problem on the blockchain at this point is just silly, since the block size limit can't even accommodate a decent number of transactions with few inputs. Worry about increasing the block size first, and then maybe in some distant future, if Bitcoin really scales to be the world reserve currency, we might get around to addressing the fungibility of dust.
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:09:16
It just seems like such a trivial issue that it is not worth worrying about. Bitcoin is in the midst of a civil war over the block size limit with huge ramifications, and you are more worried about this?

Under-powered machines retain a full copy of the blockchain, and can be called upon to redistribute it. Perhaps some users will upgrade their Internet connection and become highly useful. As the ant paper put it: "The presence of inactive workers increases the long-term persistence of the colony at the expense of decreasing short-term productivity. Inactive workers may represent a bet-hedging strategy in response to environmental stochasticity." And I think that is at least somewhat applicable, at least to the extent that we shouldn't discourage people from running a node just because they don't meet the ideal requirements.

When the UTXO gets too big for RAM, you will want to keep it on a fast disk, but SSDs are certainly fast enough, as are hard drives in RAID and even individual hard drives for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2016-10-07 21:24:36
There was a study published last year showing that many worker ants appear to be slacking off most of the time:
But that doesn't mean the lazy ants are bad for the colony. They are actually valuable, and I think running a full node under less than ideal conditions is similar. Everyone saying you need so and so much bandwidth, always leave your node on and accept many incoming connections, please stop -- that's not how healthy networks actually operate. We need the slackers too.
@_date: 2015-11-28 14:12:30
That is all true, but the problem of scaling Bitcoin isn't really limited by CPU power. We just need more Internet bandwidth, and that already exists too; it just isn't evenly distributed yet.

All things happen thanks to debt in our current system. Without debt, there is no way to extract fossil fuels or keep up demand for goods at a sufficient level to have commodity prices high enough to cover production costs. Deflationary collapse means all this debt goes away, so no one can afford to buy anything and all producers go bankrupt at the same time. International trade will seize up and there will be a forced localization with people attempting to get by with only local resources, but because almost nothing can be produced locally, there will soon be a lack of spare parts for basic infrastructure, so the electric grid will go down within a few months, and that will be the end of our civilization.
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:31:13
If our factories shut down, we only have about three weeks before a tipping point is reached and collapse of industrial civilization becomes irreversible. Machines rust, and complex supply chains cannot be reassembled because everyone is dependent on everyone else before they can make anything. We need to transition gradually to a different system if we are going to have any hope at all.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:40:45
Can we convert transaction fees to block reward somehow? For example, all transaction fees from the previous block can be paid out as block reward with the next. Or maybe half of the transaction fees should go towards the next block reward, so including transactions gets incentivized as well.

I know, but the problem with plea bargaining is how it enables the system to adapt to the expectation that nearly everyone will take a plea by cranking up the criminalization of everything and everyone to the point where you practically don't have a choice, unless you want to suffer a fate like Ulbricht's. That is not a fair system. Remember that prosecutors will try to coerce a plea bargain whether you are guilty or not, so the system perversely makes it rational to plead guilty even though you are not in a lot of cases, because the risk of refusing is so insanely high.
If plea bargaining were illegal, the system would be forced to operate with somewhat more reasonable sentences, and not be able to pile up such an insane number of potential crimes, or else the court and prison system would collapse under its own weight. That is how it should be.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:03:06
Great, but deleting files fast is not some huge accomplishment. Most of the blockchain is ready to discard once you have the UTXO set.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:21:39
It seems to me that plea bargaining is partly responsible for the uniquely American phenomenon of mass incarceration. If the government wants to imprison that many people, at least they should be required to put everyone through a trial first.

I don't think you realize how bad it will get when our global monetary system collapses. It is the operating system for our industrial civilization, and since we don't have any alternative ready, civilization will collapse. Bitcoin is also fated to sink with the banking system because of the block size limit. In the aftermath, maybe a few hundred million people can go on living, but they will have a wretched existence at the stone age level without any hope of rebooting industrial civilization.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:37:28
That is exactly how I understand pleas, and I find them deeply immoral. The state should not be allowed to coerce guilty pleas any more than they can compel you to testify against yourself. Americans are protected from the latter but not the former. You are so used to the state having this power over you that you attempt to rationalize it.

There is a minor bug in the GUI which keeps annoying me. When you select the option "Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar," it doesn't work in Linux Mint with MATE. Instead of getting minimized to the tray, the icon just disappears altogether when minimized (it works perfectly in Windows, however). The bug was introduced with the redesigned icons and I haven't tested it with 0.11.2, but that's because I use XT, which also unfortunately has this bug.

The market isn't necessarily rational, and can stay irrational for quite some time. If everyone agrees that bitcoin is just digital gold, then fine, it can be used as such and keep its value. If the expectation is a payment system suitable for everyday purchases, however, then we should expect a crash at some point. I always assumed the latter, but I could be wrong.

Nothing prevents me from running a full node, and in fact I am doing it. Which makes me one of currently 42 reachable nodes in Norway, and I can't understand why this number needs to be so low, because it is piece of cake to run a node.
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:52:54
Yes, the simplest way is to close your wallet, move the blockchain files to where you want them, and then the next time you open your wallet it will ask you where to save the blockchain and resume from the new location (at least the latest version of the wallet will do this).
@_date: 2015-11-12 10:11:29
They might try that, but if you refuse, they still have to convince a jury to convict you before they can sentence you at all.

This is not as bad as it sounds. Segwit2x should be judged on its merits rather than mostly irrelevant stuff like this.

Pruning is already an option to use if you want it. But it doesn't seem like you really want to run a full node no matter how easy it is -- you just want to cripple Bitcoin so none of us can use it properly even if we don't mind storing the whole thing.

When the economy can't grow anymore and starts shrinking because we have reached limits to growth, the average investment will have a negative yield. Therefore, negative interest rates are needed in order to encourage investments despite the expectation of losing money, or else no one would want to invest and the economy would collapse altogether. It might not work anyway, but negative interest rates are a desperate attempt to save industrial civilization from deflationary collapse. I fully support it because the alternative is death, but some of us might still be able to avoid shrinking our money by using Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is perfectly harmless until it is used to buy weapons or explosives, so that is the point the authorities should be focused on. Not the currency itself. If they control the flow of dangerous items, there is no need to crack down on the currency.
But I suspect the reaction will be worse for us. Bitcoin always seemed a little too good to be true, and I am amazed at how well it has been tolerated so far. Perhaps our luck is running out and governments will treat Bitcoin with their usual level of intolerance from here.

I run a node with dozens of connections and anyone can connect, so Big Brother can already spy on me. It makes no difference to me what the default seeds are, because you have already accepted spying by running a reachable node.

True enough, but I think Charlie Lee was making a point about Bitcoin and its creator here rather than Litecoin.

What I do and recommend is to run one node of Bitcoin Core and one Bitcoin ABC on different computers with the same wallet file. Simply transfer your coins to an address in your Core/ABC wallet before August 1st, and then you can spend them on both chains after the fork (ABC has replay protection, so that is not an issue). Forget about hardware wallets -- those are for people who can't be bothered to run a full node.

So the system is designed to only give a "fair" sentence if you let yourself be coerced into pleading guilty, and you think that is the way it should be. I couldn't disagree more. The entire concept of plea bargaining is immoral in my opinion, and I am glad it is not allowed in my country. Americans are so used to plea bargaining that they think it is normal, but it is actually an insane travesty of justice as far as most of the world is concerned.

I think it is a matter of perspective. A hard fork is backwards compatible in the sense that it can index the whole blockchain from the genesis block onwards and aims to be a continuation/replacement of the same network. I might be in the minority here, but at least Mike Hearn agrees with my terminology:
And his explanation always made more sense to me, regardless of how one feels about forks and blocksize.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:54:19
It seems to me that both soft forks and hard forks are backwards compatible, but only soft forks are *forwards* compatible. Both types of clients can handle old blocks up to the fork and are therefore backwards compatible, but hard forks break forwards compatibility by making clients that don't upgrade unable to accept the new kind of blocks.

It was in bad taste to use them, I agree. However, if the concept of Segwit2x is found to be desirable, it will be piece of cake to implement a client without those seeds.

Of course we can't scale infinitely, but we can certainly go far beyond one-megabyte blocks.

You don't know that you are addicted until you at least try to quit and fail. I find that it is easy to get carried away looking at Bitcoin all day, but I can do something else if I really want to.
