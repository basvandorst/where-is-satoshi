These are very well done and I applaud you for giving them away freely, but you need to start rending digital representations of bitcoin and its underlying technology. These physical coins just do not suffice.

I for one will reserve my judgement until I see the OP verify his sources ... and perhaps publish his report.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:42:10
I agree wholeheartedly, however it remains to be seen where the technology goes from here. The internet protocol was dubbed something similar of an "unravelling of legacy systems", yet it has somehow evolved into a sort of panopticon. The questions today should focus on how do we make cryptocurrencies technologically neutral and outside the realm of dogmatic policy making. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:26:46
You control a particular percentage (depending on how many BTC you hold) of the distributed financial ledger known as the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:26:17
Thank you for the advice I am always looking to improve my articles, so this feedback is much appreciated. One thing I am trying to determine is exactly the target market I am going after. Right now it seems more of the technically advanced bunch, but as you mentioned, they would not learn a whole bunch new from this article. Do you think it would be more effective to go after newbies to bitcoin or the technically inclined? Also, I am not completely familiar with generating random addresses securely/entropy. I will have to look further into this, so thank you once again.

Considering this is a post around blockchain technologies, I thought to mention a group open to individuals who are interested in learning about and researching blockchain networks, the technology bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built upon. For anyone wanting to post questions, comments, share information, and make their events known to a wider audience, this is the place to do it! We are currently developing a forum to facilitate further conversation, and we have LinkedIn and Google+ groups under the same name (Blockchain Networks).

That's a very deep and difficult question.
The conclusion I'm coming to, is that if [bitcoin is backed by time itself]( a universal force that is **magnitudes more intelligent than men and military might**, then will it supercede the USD in the medium to long future?
My answer is that it just might.

One word: [sidechains](
As someone who is not a programming genius myself, I would say focus on your own strengths and try to be the very best at those things. You do not want to be someone who is "good enough" at a large number of things but exceptional at nothing.
If you cultivate your own skills, you will attract people with complementary skill sets which will allow you to ignite your own business ideas.

The one perception?
The world is wide open. No one can say for sure what will happen tomorrow or the day after. Most people go about their daily life as though someone is in charge (the church, the banks, the state, the UN). In truth, the world is nothing more than a mote of dust floating somewhere in the universe, and we are the ones who must commandeer this spaceship.
The only person who is in control, is YOU. That's the way it should be, and that's the way it will always be.

For the most part, alternative cryptocurrencies today are worthless. They are nothing more than fringe experiments. However, I do see a future for the few alt coins which can establish a very specific use case for their existence.
In the future, I think one area to look at is anonymity in digital money. There will always be a market demand for anonymity and a "Tor of cryptocurrency" could hold a viable competitive advantage.

Bitcoin is actually [stabilizing at quite a remarkable rate]( However, expect at least one more large bubble before we arrive somewhere near a price equilibrium. I anticipate bitcoin is following a [traditional S-curve]( which we have seen in similar social networks.
My play on bitcoin? It's a long term investment. Buy and hold.

I think bitcoin has the potential to be the most sound form of money we have ever seen. However, there will be many hurdles to overcome before we get to such a point.
There will be [political turmoil](
There will be [privacy issues](
There will be [adoption growing pains](
When bitcoin is properly adopted, and it will take years, individuals who understand the technology and the economics behind it will have the ability to mobilize the world over, conducting their financial life on their own accord and the unique ability to self-govern.

What does not require regulation is the access to, use of, and disclosure of use to others of the bitcoin network.
