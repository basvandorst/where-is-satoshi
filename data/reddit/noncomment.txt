People believe he has a billion dollars of bitcoin on his computer. I don't know how likely it is, but it's plausible he could get kidnapped or robbed for something he probably doesn't even have.

Yes this would be possible. There was a group a while back distributing code you can run on your computer that will help crack protein folding problems. There are probably numerous other candidates.

Sorry but no. The parent comment might not have been well written, but he is right. The guy can barely speak English and supposedly wrote all those well written online posts and the original paper. There is zero evidence that he did it other than his name, which makes no sense - why would he take such great steps to hide his identity and use his real name?
I'd bet you that the time periods he posted online don't match up with the timezone he lives in, or that further analysis of his writing style reveals it definitely isn't the same person. Perhaps someone could even find evidence he was in some location when one of the posts was made, but that's a bit more difficult years later.
Still, you can't just ruin some guys life on **zero** evidence and then bitch at people about "denial".

Even classical computers. What if someone came up with a more efficient algorithm? How do we know it's impossible? And we don't know that quantum computers are impossible either, for that matter.

Gwern said at the time "Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he’s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did."
I think he was correct, just it turned out it was the latter possibility.

That is fucking incredible. I wonder if that was on purpose or just a random accident.
"Local clown invents bitcoin, more at 11."

It's understandable that people would be angry when they believed they were being scammed and lied to. I'm just quietly watching to see what happens, but I don't expect him to show proof.

The mods of the subreddit are actually admins and using the contact the mods button at that subreddit is actually the recommended way of contacting the admins.

It would stop a panic on the bank though, and presumably the bank would have enough assets to pay back most of it's debt (if this isn't happening due to an economic collapse or something and it's assets didn't just lose all their value.)

That subreddit is atrocious.

People are more familiar with dollars and it has a more stable price atm. Who cares what people price things in? The point of bitcoin, like any currency, is that you can use it to trade in. As long as the trades are happening in bitcoin, you can set your prices in furlongs, who cares?

No, I'm saying it wouldn't destroy the economy or require a bailout by the government. At least not just people voluntarily leaving the bank.

It matters because if the richest suddenly cashed out it would really affect the market. Other than that it doesn't really affect anyone.

Brute forcing them sure, but is there any way someone could, theoretically, figure out how to generate keys with relatively little computing power? I know very little about cryptography but I was under the impression this wasn't guaranteed to be impossible, just assumed.

I thought that was a parody.


That just sounds like a wonderful idea.
