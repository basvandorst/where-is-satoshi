The global trend is up, but the waves and bursts of hype cryptocurrencies receive create these bubbles.
And by bubble I mean when it reaches $1,000 in a matter of weeks and then crashes and downtrends for several years... and you are left bag holding all the way down to $200 with an investment that shrank by 80%.
Or more recently when you buy at $20,000, and then for several years you bag hold all the way down to ??? (Value yet to be defined).


Yes, we are in a bubble, but it doesn't mean that in the future (most likely years) Bitcoin's price will not reach $20,000 and beyond again. It just means that as of today it is way too soon for the market to have built up the strength to maintain such price, hence the steady decline (or bubble burst) that is currently happening.

Bitcoin is people's first thought when they hear about cryptocurrencies. Which means most new crypto-enthusiasts will likely buy BTC if they want to throw money into crypto. And a lot of speculators and investors are looking after this effect in order to make good gains. BTC is also the coin that has the biggest marketcap, media attention, etc. which is something that very big whales are looking for. In short the network effect of Bitcoin is unbeatable and it is good when investing.
Aside from that, there are people that are mostly interested in the technology behind and where it can bring us in the future. As for now, BTC is sadly very far from replacing fiat currency, and as a matter of fact there are other blockchains which are closer to achieving this technological goal than Bitcoin (I’m not saying they will succeed).
Once you understand BTC and start looking at other coins you realise that Bitcoin is very conservative and that decisions taken for its usage and for the kind of users it is intended for is strongly questionable. Which is another reason why people who are seeking for solutions that are working today are turning towards alts. For example, people might have a need to spend their money at a certain speed, with ease, with low fees, at a certain security level, with or without anonymity/traceability, etc. And all these aspects (or tweaks) is an important part of the structure of a currency and the right combination of all these is what will push people towards adoption and consider a specific coin as something that can be exchanged like fiat currencies.
At the moment Bitcoin despite the fact that it is skyrocketing is, in my opinion, not the leader of this "revolution". The revolution is led by the technology that is defining Bitcoin and which is currently being embraced by many companies and startups around the world. Those same that will shape tomorrow's use cases of the technology for everyone.

@_date: 2019-03-13 22:29:58

@_date: 2019-03-13 22:34:48
It is normal now. It didn’t use to be in the past. All related to block size my friend...
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:14:47
The sad part is they can’t event enter the BTC game. Too expensive and they don’t have the money to afford it anymore. They don’t even have decent electricity to mine and sync with the blockchain anymore. So, BTC would be by far the worst solution for them right now.
Yet it is being posted here... as if BTC could help resolve the situation.
What they would probably need is a fiat stable currency pegged with USD or similar strong currency. And a currency they can exchange from hand to hand without requiring technology.
BTC is not for poor countries. BTC is for strong and developed countries. It is what comes next, after fiat currencies, in well-established societies.

Disrupt != Destruct. Bitcoin should embrace the law, not walk around it.

If Bitcoin’s goal was facilitate money laundering and hiding funds, it would have never been designed the way it is today in the first place!

Yes, governments can mitigate what software is publicly available. This is why websites like Silk Road got taken down, also why extensive efforts are being made to kill illegal torrent platforms, and so on. And I can also guarantee you that there are special measures in case of cyber attacks if malicious software spreads and reaches critical facilities such as nuclear power plants.
There is also a huge gap between drinking alcohol and helping fund terrorism. Your argument doesn’t hold here. Also, cryptocurrencies can be confiscated, so you’ll stop using it because you won’t have any left to use.
If you want BTC to be The Pirate Bay of cryptocurrencies, then fine, but don’t be surprised if it’s not globally adopted and embraced by all citizens and businesses around the world who will prefer more law-abiding systems.

‪CSW in 6 steps:‬
‪1. Be the real Satoshi and announce it to the world‬
‪2. Don’t provide immutable evidence just yet‬
‪3. Keep feeding those calling you a fraud with weak evidence (easily forgeable but yet true)‬
‪4. Sue the shit out of them‬
‪5. Prove you are SN in court‬
‪6. You win‬

You already introduced your attack vector by forcing users to check the average fees on an external and centralized website...
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:56:26
That means Bitcoin is restricted.
@_date: 2019-04-14 07:41:55
Trust me. There will still be a lot of people to challenge it.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:05:07
Soon: BCH and BSV Gab forks.
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:10:17
Congrats. Now you can hodl it tight while bitcoin goes back to limbo.

@_date: 2019-04-14 07:42:21
I think you underestimate people’s stupidity.
Also, the keys for early coins could have been lost or given a long time ago.

@_date: 2019-04-23 15:41:26
If users have to bother figuring out which fees they need to pay to process transactions, then there is an obvious design flaw...

@_date: 2019-04-20 19:33:42
Hodl it! Don’t sell it!
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:27:55
You also start to embrace law and regulations.

Pretty simple: Because when you cash out you need to go through KYC.
Also, if you had followed his story (which I doubt you did) you would also understand the other reasons.

Guys, just stop this nonsense.
1. The people in the streets are people with little money. They will not bankrupt anything.
2. If people withdraw their money, they'll withdraw cash, not buy crypto.
3. You are clearly posting this in a hope of a Bitcoin price pump. Just drop your bag and quit crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-12 06:35:45
Yes, miners’ nodes, so they can collect TX and propagate newly found blocks as quick as possible.
Definitely not random people running a node at their electrical expense just for the sake of running a node...
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:53:29
I understand the movement and the intent. The people posting this news over and over again here on this sub have selfish intentions.
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:03:33
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:28:42
Very real... 
Too much risk involved, unless you want to get flagged and fined by the gov.
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:18:21
Ever heard of Wechat Pay and Alipay? That’s what chinese people use. No need of crypto and already approved/sponsored/recommended by their gov.
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:37:35
How would you call it when it splits in two distinct chains? And they both live...
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:24:42
You don’t see because you don’t want to see. It’s on the page. Now stop your nonsense.
@_date: 2019-01-26 06:19:50
But I thought lightning was meant to prevent that... why does this still keep happening?

Will he buy them back? Probably not.
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:53:21
This is good for private blockchains.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:29:40
The funny part is that nobody uses crypto in China ��. There are only miners for profit there. So I guess this news is a good thing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:01:00
The 1% owns more than all the middle class.
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:25:37
Not true.

Unless he has Chinese officials in his pocket or if he is acting as a gov puppet.
@_date: 2019-01-12 06:38:31
Depends if you are mining...
@_date: 2019-01-26 06:23:01
Once you go crypto there is no way back. This is the sad truth.
This shit happens to many people, more specifically when dealing with small or non trustworthy exchanges and small banks.
Hope you’ll get your money at some point. My guess is that they will release the payment during the next bull run.
@_date: 2019-01-12 06:41:38
Then it doesn’t really matter how many connections you have.
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:10:41

Hey bro let me share a secret with ya... You can also make money in a downtrend by shorting your coins. ;)
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:32:58
You answered your own question.

Tether looks ridiculous compared to the federal reserve.

Nice. ��
I don’t need to work anymore. Free fiat forever.
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:34:06
With this logic, when reward reaches 0, Bitcoin’s price reaches ∞! Unlimited Money for everyone. ��
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:44:45
Time to say "you will never see BTC under $10k again" for the 375th time. Works every time.
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:03:46
I hope they hodl them since before the BCH fork.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:39:04
Too many people expecting their shitcoins to poop lambos. This is not how economics work. You need losers to make winners.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:54:04
Agreed, but that’s not what I can read all over the place on Reddit.
@_date: 2019-05-30 07:52:48
Love it! Haha
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:34:43
Soon $6000 again, as predicted :D

Whale said no.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:29:30
It will soon be time.
@_date: 2019-05-27 11:47:47
Looks like it’s a bit out of fuel now.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:07:06
I bought BTC to get rich quick. I don’t plan on using it because of high fees. I bought BTC on an exchange and sold on that same exchange.
BTC is like gold. You buy it to hodl it, until you are rich. Then you cash out and buy a Lambo.
Many people lie to themselves about it or hide this truth. I don’t.
Downvote if you agree.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:44:51
If they do their own research properly a lot of people on this sub will dislike the content.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:47:33
When there is only a few building and everyone else wanking on their chair expecting things to happen and global adoption to occur with marketing, then yes, it is pretty much a zero sum game, also very close to a ponzi.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:56:28
Hidden fees way too high from what I remember. But maybe this has changed now.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:30:56
Sure ��.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:27:16
What happened to BTC-E by the way?
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:56:49
Why not?
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:51:14
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:28:25
Then massive drop below all previous buy orders. ��
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:42:47
Maybe  ?
@_date: 2019-05-24 09:38:43
BTC logo upwright on his head, I love it! ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:35:34
He bought. Dump it.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:15:15
Long her!
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:23:39
Only 110% to go before my break-even, not bad! ��
Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:24:23
And when it goes down $100?
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:51:35
Short Zuckerbucks.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:15:52
BSV miners?
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:59:33
I’d buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:29:00

Where did you get this chart? Coinfloor seems to trade in GBP only.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:35:24

@_date: 2019-05-23 01:01:13
The cult.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:46:15
Exactly! But I think the author of this drawing meant those warriors are BSV warriors.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:40:55
Different story being told. Maybe the reason why Coindesk forgot to link the source.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:31:07
I know a lot of people who’ll be disappointed when they’ll discover who Satoshi is.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:24:49
The more of this meme, the more I sell.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:35:37
I probably should have added /s
I was mainly speaking for all the people who bought the December pump of 2017 and never got a chance to be in the green.
I don’t hold any BTC anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:16:27
Whales: ok now we dump.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:29:14
Then you buy, and massive drop.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:55:57
Oh I didn’t know about the exit scam.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:44:33
Because the narrative is:
Satoshi would never... [insert something here]
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:08:43
What if a family member dies?
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:41:29
Maybe 20 years from now $500 would just buy you a cup of coffee. So, 1 BTC might still be 1 BTC of today’s value.
