I'm just a concern citizen here, the code you have open is not what's in use. Don't try to spin this around. Why is the code not auditable???

Why not? What's the problem?

That code is not being used YET, it's architecture is quite different. Uses a socket on localhost instead of browser plugin. I'm still waiting on them to have an official answer.

Bullshit, what's the problem with showing the old code since it's going away any ways???

Thanks that's all I wanted to know, why the secrecy?
Now I can have the source code for the older version to audit?

Something doesn't smell good.
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:53:49
Truth? All I want is to be able to audit.

I've asked them before, never get an answer. It's a fair question.
