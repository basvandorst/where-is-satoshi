What if at some point Trump decides to nuke China?
You can propose dumb hypotheticals that would never reasonably happen all day. The institutional structure of the Fed is designed to be independent and employs top notch academics (hundreds of them) specializing in monetary policy to run it. It will never happen.

You should care about whether or not you've been reading/watching bullshit, because I think you have. It's alright you don't care what people think of you but you should care whether you are sure of this stuff and where you are getting this information

I would be skeptical. Too many people don't know how to distinguish between someone who's smart and someone who *sounds* smart. The fact this post has as many upvotes as it does proves it. If you are listening to someone, make sure they are respected in their field. My field is economics, and some of the people that people listen to (Peter Schiff on the right, Robert Reich on the left) so called "economists" don't even have undergrad degrees in the field, but they sound smart so people listen to them

Money supply is unlimited if the CB chooses it to be, but that's not what they would ever choose, so why does it matter?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:03:31
1. Money does not have an unlimited supply, the supply is set by the central bank
2. Hyperinflation, as a result of a poor institutional structure of both the government and central bank

This has literally nothing to do with keynesianism. You literally don't even know what Keynesianism is. Literally everything you wrote is completely idiotic. Please link me to these Nobel prizes you are speaking of

Being so dumb that you loan money out for a 100 years without taking into account inflation isn't "debt not being paid" it is just being dumb.
Inflation is an accepted risk when you purchase securities. That doesn't change under any other system, either.  If the price of gold changes, you get fucked the same way, usually even worse since gold is so much more volatile.

Also, I'm still waiting for your example of all this debt that is rarely paid.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:13:46


? The US has *never* defaulted on debt. How is something very rarely paid when it is always paid, for over 200 years? (with one exception of a strange case where they delayed payments on an extremely small amount of bonds in 1979). Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?
In the USA public debt is being managed by printing/creating more fiat money
Seigniorage is just one way the debt burden is eased, and is taken into account by people who buy government bonds. In the long run, the level of inflation can not help manage debt. Only short term increases can ease debt because debt holders will account for a steady level of inflation. Since the US has been a steady 2%, obviously this is not the case.

It's an effective store of value over the time it's in your wallet. Not 100 years.

Do you disagree with the economists? You think they are wrong, and the fundamental value of a bitcoin is over 1k? You think you have a clue what you are talking about compared to them?
You really think these economists, who spend their entire careers thinking about things like this, don't understand the role of technological change with respect to things like this? You know so little it's like you can't even comprehend the depth of the standard economists' knowledge


You don't deserve politeness. It is because of people like you saying "bitcoin will keep going up" that naïve people make bad choices and lose lots of money
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:09:36
[Economists]( does Bitcoin have a fundamental value of at least $1000?
4% say yes. What the fuck do you know about "fundamentals"
you guys are just a bunch of retards in a world where even people with masters and PhDs from Harvard can't beat the market. What keeps you going is the idiot that always says how much money they've made, as if it was actual skill rather than blind luck

You'd rather have the value of your currency fluctuate by up to 50% in a matter of months?
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:54:48


A lot less. But you'd also get paid like less than a dollar an hour. Wages are a price, and like the general price level increases with inflation. Inflation has no real effect on wages in the long run.

You are probably so stupid because you get offended whenever you are wrong, and double down instead of learning something or changing your mind

What about [100%]( of polled ivy league level professors of economics and the comments they left? Is it you that is stupid, or them?

No one keeps a hundred dollars in their wallet for a hundred years, so discussing what would happen if you kept your savings like that is pointless and a non issue
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:58:45
I have $6000 in savings. That's my entire net worth. Even I have it in an index fund
But that guy apparently thinks only rich people own stocks. probably doesn't work or is retarded and buys gold coins and shit thinking he's making a smart financial decision

Yes, why not cite a precious metal salesman with no education in economics who tries to undermine gullible laymen's trust in the traditional financial system in order to sell them gold?

Where recessions were [frequent and long lasting]( and the price level was [hyper volatile](
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:01:13
You realize if your currency increases in value by 1000%, your pay per hour is likely to drop 1000% as well right? [Long run monetary neutrality]( is fundamental to economics, I believe it's even taught in introductory courses. However, I would never expect anyone dumb enough to think crypto is a good alternative for conventional fiat to have taken intro macro.
The volatility of the value of money over the course of months up to a handful of years is immeasurably more relevant than the unambiguously completely irrelevant variation in it's value over a century

A recession is defined as negative growth. If a country had slow growth or no growth, they would not be in a recession
