Not who you asked but I'll give my answer anyway. If another cryptocurrency exceeds bitcoin in terms of market cap(and maintains that price level for, say, several months) I may lose faith. I don't think cryptocurrency is a bubble, but bitcoin may not be the best of them.

It's not Taoist but a [Syncretist]( story. Either way, it's a good analogy.

I'm not sure, but Houbi is CNY based. Maybe it's about exchange rate?

Serious question, how does Bitcoinstream make money? Who is paying for the satellites?

You don't need tons of hash power to be a LN node. It's the key. If you know/use Tor you know what I mean. LN is not inherently centralized.

It's basically a bitcoin-backed currency because you can claim your bitcoin any time. Like gold-backed USD before 1973. Yeah you're still at the mercy of gov(or banks, or in this case wallet providers) that they don't cheat the system or change the rules without any consensus, but at least the system is better than credit-backed(I mean, nothing-backed) fiat.
It may not be the decentralized future we all looking for, but my point is
1)we should use bitcoin directly to pay small transfers
2)until LN takes off bitcoin is useless for small transfers(or, because LN has some flaws, it'll never take off that bitcoin has no hope)
are both wrong. If LN goes well then we win. If not, or not yet, we can treat bitcoin just as digital gold and build gold standard currencies on it.

Because people who advertised Bitcoin for free transfer are idiots. If everyone uses Bitcoin for daily purchase we'll need like 8GB blocks. For "free" and "instant" you need off-chain transaction.
And before someone says Lightning Network needs years to take off, off-chain transaction != LN. LN gives you trustless off-chain transaction, but for small daily purchase, you don't need the trustless part. In Japan, people deposit their Bitcoin to wallet like Bitflyer and they are literally doing off-chain transactions right now. That's what we need before the era of LN comes.

It's nothing wrong to spend BTC. You're helping the ecosystem. If that's all BTC you have, well that's a little shame, but nothing wrong.

Disagree. Bitcoin is created to be tested. They could've doubled down and hurt everyone including themselves, but they chose to back off. I'm willing to respect this.

There are two wars. Bitcoin to be an legal investment, and Bitcoin to be a currency. We are winning the first but haven't started the second.
