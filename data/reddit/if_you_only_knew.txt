oh good another idiot. Jesus how are you this fucking gullible?


let me guess, Infowars?

Ease up on the coffee yo! youre shaking like a leaf.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:37:57
Oh look a college libertarian. They always have the best comments. I bet he loves Atlas Shrugged and thinks its a perfect model.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:39:09
good lord, you should stop now. You really dont want people actually knowing youre a dumbass.

I had this same problem months ago. If i remember correctly i was able to go through the coinbase site to upload the id photos and get the confirmation rolling. Something about the gdax site was just NOT working for me. It was sort of hard to find, i think i had to go through the help section to find the link. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:26:01
I don't think so, but as far as I'm aware, they are connected. Gdax is coinbases exchange, so they share authorizations if I'm not mistaken.

how does bitcoin keep hyperinflation from happening?
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:26:25
But wouldnt that open the system to manipulation?
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:30:39
Explain how btc is impervious to hyperinflation. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:16:29
Why would you want to rub it in the faces of people that missed the boat? thats kind of a dick thing to say. Its not like they scoffed at you, most of them didn't know anything about it, you egotistical shit head.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:20:31
These are terrible answers that are not helping your case for btc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:59
next time say "sorry its all invested and i cant touch it for 10 years."
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:38:52
Yes asking for an explanation is a joke. You fucking dickhead.  Want more people to accept btc as mainstream, try answering the question with out being a condesending fuck stick, jack ass.

"its not real money"
correct! it's "digitally scare currency" [sic]
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:24:05
What time is it? oh...this aged well.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:45:00
Yeah? Is that why its been at ~6,400 for how long now?
@_date: 2018-10-01 12:12:27
LOL, this sub. Good grief guys.
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:45:21
This question has been asked every frigging week for the last 8 months.
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:59:16
yeah but with ZERO protection from pump and dump by the big players and no repercussions if you even catch them at it. Sounds like a fantastic alternative, you know, because lacking any and all regulations never caused any issues.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:13:53
get over yourselves.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:52:47
lol jesus. every damn day now huh?
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:14:00
oddly enough there is a link in the side bar that says [Getting Started](
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:15:35
i believe this is the unfortunate truth.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:25:56
yes, actually.

Why would LE arrest buyers? They would much rather get the seller.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:31:45
Yes we are.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:39:21
First off, a buyer would never get life in prison for buying for personal use. Second they want the sellers, not the buyers. Think about how this all works and what the goal is. Would you think they are going to invest resources to catch some asshole buying a gram of coke off the internet, or the person selling it? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:36:11
Cops dont usually arrest buyers if they dont have too. And buying off the DM makes that even less useful to them.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:41:38
Cops care more about sellers than buyers, and buyers from on the DM have no real knowledge of who the seller is or where they are.

19 year olds that basically got lucky betting on a very risky investment.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:16:28
it went over 6000 today for a brief amount of time, I think OP is asking why its not showing that on coinbase, Geniuses.
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:18:35
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:22:50
I saw it go over on gdax, but now even there it looks adjusted. not sure what thats about.
