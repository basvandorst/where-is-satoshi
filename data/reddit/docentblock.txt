It is common for new technologies to be adopted by lawbreakers and people living in the fringe of a society. For instance, internet which we all use today was widely used to distrubute porn. It also started off with a bad reputation and then got adopted by the common world. Or, it was edgy to read the news from the internet, whereas one could read it from a newspaper like "normal" people. Or, how Nascar is so famous now. People used to upgrade their cars to run away from the cops while carrying prohibited alcohol. Then it became Nascar-
From Ether Review Episode  - can't remember the name of the person who presented this argument
I disagree with Taaki, bitcoin should not go back to its roots. Bitcoin should try its best to be widely adopted (and scale at the same time lol)

People will soon understand that in near future USD, EUR or any other traditional currency will have no value-
Edit: Replaced "10 years time" with "near future"
Alright, 10 years is a little too ambitious, but I truly believe this will eventually happen.
