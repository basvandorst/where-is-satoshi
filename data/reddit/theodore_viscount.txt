I'd be interested in knowing what the problem is. Again, all I got was a vague email about verifying ID, I've been using it for over a year and haven't had any other issues. There are some other posts on their community board indicating there were cancelled orders in the past few days.

Well, I've been meaning to look into alternatives, so this has been a good kick in the ass to start looking around.

This is similar to my problems with them this past week. They started cancelling my orders left and right (7 BTC worth so far, 5 BTC more outstanding). The generic email they sent said to upload ID. I've used them since 2014 and already have my ID's on file with them. Uploaded again. Still can't buy and they haven't followed up on my emails to them. I started another thread about this yesterday.

Me too.

I haven't been given a case number yet.

I've heard good stuff about them. Like phone card things right? Will give it a shot. Thanks!

Low priced, meaning last week when it was around 380. Now that it's around 420 they're cancelling and going to refund me in about 3-4 days. They're doing well on this I suppose...

Still waiting on a response from the emails I've sent to that address.

I've used them for a year and a half and only started having problems this week.
Not saying you aren't right and I am seeking alternatives. Thankfully the market is robust. Any personal favorites of yours you'd like to recommend?

And just got another cancellation for 2 BTC with the same generic Cancellation email. Up to 7 BTC that they've cancelled on me with no followup from their Support email.

Admittedly, I am a bit of a noob. Not trying to pretend like I'm an expert or a high volume trader. I did get lured in because of ease of use. Thought it was an okay place to purchase as I haven't had any issues until now. Buyers remorse...

Yeah, my account has been fine for about a year. No issues, no cancelled transactions. I use instant buy as well and the value no longer appears when I hit Instant Max, though the column on the right has a value in there.
