I bought 3 bitcoin a few years ago... sold/gambled 1 BTC when 1 was around $150 and cashed out enough to cover my initial investment (&lt;$100). I put the remaining two into 2 BTC into 2 paper wallets and forgot about them in a safe box with my personal papers.
Recently, I freaked out when I heard my 2 BTC were worth almost 40k and panic-bought a TREZOR for $150. I bought $100 worth of bitcoin to test out my TREZOR and cover transfer fees... but that's not even enough to cover transfer fees of moving my 2 BTC to TREZOR ($30 worth of bitcoin transfer fee x 4). &gt;.&gt;  And then Bitcoin corrects. I feel bad spending USD my magic internet money because everyone is telling me to cash out and I can't say "I've already cashed out" if I'm investing in bitcoin hobby stuff. 
I got some stainless steel nameplates ($9) and a letter press punch set ($20) to copy down my TREZOR BIP24 passphrases as a poor-man's cryptosteel (~$200). I was going to put those in a safe deposit box at a bank (~$10-15/mo) once Bitcoin hit $25K since I don't trust my parents. But now it's correcting so I still have time to take care of that. If someone gets a hold of my recovery password for TREZOR, they get all my money, right? Or do the password-protected wallets guard against that?
I guess part of me is like, "Why is this costing so much? In my day a BTC was only $40, hurr." I don't want to waste my money--even buying a hardware wallet seemed like a splurge.

Hah, I was thinking about doing the same thing, but got cold feet at the thought of alt-right 4channers ruining it. I'm sure the dev is making bank, but at least I still have my sooooul.

That's actually humorously good/accurate up until they said a person could buy bitcoin from "bitcoin."

Yeah, I do realize.

My moon is 1.5 million per btc in 10 years, only because I really want to just retire on bitcoin.

They double billed me, refunded the double billing, then my bank put $15 worth of charges on each refund.

They need strong crypto currencies because once Trump is out of the White House they are going to be hit hard with sanctions. It's pretty short sighted to think this is a good event because it will probably mean stronger US crypto regulations in the long run.

I think there's going to be at least one bull run to ~50k, then a correction to ~15-20k. Or it could just stay where it is at 10k (~what it is now).

You sound like a salesman trying to get a "yes," so I'm skeptical. Is your next post going to be a link to your blog/book/podcast?

2013. Bought 2 for \~$100 each after realizing that would be easier than mining.  It's still 70x my investment. I gambled .5 bitcoin away before that. Made a paper wallet and Hodled.
