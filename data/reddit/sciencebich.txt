Bitcoin has only been around a decade and 85% of it has been mined already. So early adopters got to accumulate much more quickly which further increases the wealth gap if bitcoin were to become a reserve currency. Does anyone else think that Bitcoin should have had a longer period in the stages where most of it hadn’t been mined yet? If bitcoin was only 30-50% mined now when most people have heard of it and it’s being discussed on the political stage, there would be more equal distribution of the asset later on right?

He probably has heavy bags that started accumulating years ago

Keep in mind this space has also evolved significantly since 2017. Over the past week Mnuchin Powell and Trump has commented on bitcoin and crypto. First step of adoption is awareness. Second step is interest. I believe we’re transitioning to step 2 this year.

Mnuchin didn’t say it was a threat but rather it should conform to regulations imposed on legacy financial systems such as AML and KYC. It is interesting that powell trump and mnuchin commented on crypto in the span of a week though. any press is good press at this stage

I canceled my cable, downgraded my internet, and switched to t-mobile (from att). I’m using the extra disposable income to DCA monthly. I’ve also been wanting to get a galaxy s10 which was on sale for prime day. Decided to forgo it and buy bitcoin instead. I’ll upgrade my phone next year
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:51:33
I think a few months of consolidation around 10-12k will be better in the long run than a quick jump to 15k soon

It’s because bitcoin threatens the status quo which allows the rich to retain their power. They have no need or desire to understand bitcoin. 
This is beginning to change as bitcoin gains momentum. Now the narrative is that it becomes riskier to miss out on potential gains from this asset class than it is to stay on the sidelines - which is why we see many financial institutions filling their bags.

to add to this. there are quadrillion usd worth of derivatives - a significant amount held by deutsche bank which will most likely go under (they laid off 18k employees recently)

I bet he has a sizable bag. He has no reason to admit this because it would hurt his large stake in precious. it would be smarter for him to diversify a bit into bitcoin and keep hush about it and wait

@_date: 2019-06-29 03:33:06
i purchased more at 6k but didn’t have the stomach to increase my stack when it decreased to 3k. i’m just glad to have recovered the past few months
