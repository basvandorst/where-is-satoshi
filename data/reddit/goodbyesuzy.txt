Nah, no crash. Moving averages are about to cross and the market is at an ATH. In fact Bitcoin is taking off as I type this. The hull is back baby! 
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:54:37
Where is the volume? Nobody trades Bitcoin anymore? On GDAX it just feels like it's just me swapping Bitcoin with my buddy down the street.

Typically when the long term moving average (the average price over a 26 day period) crosses over the short term moving average (the average price over a 12 day period) then that's a very bearish signal. When the opposite happens and the short term crosses the long term that's a very bullish signal. (That's what happened yesterday). The time period doesn't have to be 12 and 26 but I use that because those are the stock numbers on GDAX.

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:07
The market is going down because everything is over valued, the exchanges are overloaded, and insider trading/suspicious behaviour is happening across the board.

Makes no sense. If you're shorting Bitcoin you'll go broke. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:03:10
Yeah it's a tough one.... The new coin is created. We decide it has value (value is created when we decide something is useful). 
So, we've created value but value is different than money. 
Now it's only when we decide to exchange it that money comes into the equation. A buyer and a seller agree on a price and wether you're apart of this transaction or not the price that they agree on is the price that your coin (in this scenario) is worth. 
So we've created new value (not money) but the money comes from somewhere else (someone's piggy bank, someone's stock portfolio) when time comes to buy or sell the coin. (And as a result the coin they buy devalues their piggy bank/stock portfolio by the same amount). New value, no new money. The money just is moving from one place to another.

You're right. So look at the the facts. B2X is dead. Many are calling for an apocalypse but with all the money everyone has made this year on Bitcoin no one (least of all the miners) is going to let that happen.

@_date: 2017-11-08 15:14:56
Haha Bitcoin has value because it is a system of rules without rulers. If you think that the big money doesn't know this you're daft. It was never meant as a hostile takeover. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:55:01
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:38:03
Plus I re-invested it in BTC and made about 100% profit on it by now so it pretty much works out. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:11:17
I don't know if we get there again. I would wish you good luck but since I'm HODL-ing my interests are the opposite of yours at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:02:05

@_date: 2017-11-08 15:19:04
Just want to address the point you are making. I'm not telling everyone in this post let's go make tea and forget about supporting what we believe in. I'm saying that if we hold strong now as we have been there is nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:38:24
Haha well at least we agree on the skyward trajectory of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:24:55
They thought they had majority. They thought they had consensus. The exchanges thought they could speak for their users. They were mistaken. 
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:34:11
Looks more like a sandal...
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:53:47
All the businesses who were involved in the NYA depend on the longevity and profitability of Bitcoin. Their intention was never a hostile takeover. They assumed that they represented a majority however the exchanges made the mistake of thinking they could speak on behalf of their clients, but that isn't the case.  What's bad for Bitcoin is bad for them and B2X is bad for Bitcoin. As proof of this you can watch Segwit2x futures crashing day by day.

@_date: 2017-11-06 15:16:53
No, I think they realize what's bad for Bitcoin is bad for them. And B2X is bad for Bitcoin. (It wasn't a hostile takeover to them they thought they had majority but the belief that the companies could speak on behalf of the users was wrong). I think all this nonsense is going to start to fade away and be much less exciting than we originally thought.

@_date: 2017-11-08 15:04:45
For the reasons stated above. This was never meant to be a hostile takeover. It was never meant to be malicious. It was suppose to have wide community support which clearly isn't the case. It's already failed.

It has come from exactly nowhere! Value is in the eye of the beholder. If the new coin is created and people decide it has value then we've created new "money" (FYI no new money was actually created) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:27:01
It is overwhelmingly clear that to takeover Bitcoin is to render it worthless. Why would they do that? This wasn't meant to be a hostile takeover. It was meant to be a consensus by the community.

Let's imagine you are an investor and you believe markets are overvalued and you want to realize some profit. What would you sell first? Your shares in Amazon and Apple? Or your speculative Bitcoin investment that could drop 50% overnight? 
Now fast forward to during/after a market correction. What would you buy back first. Your favorite stock that will recover over the next year? Or a few Bitcoins that could recover 50% overnight?

The chinese will use the coming days as their last chance to buy Bitcoin, pushing up the prices as a result. They'll have to withdraw them from exchanges and transfer them to come storage. This will remove speculative trading and further limit the Bitcoin supply, pushing up prices again. Get ready we're headed for a new all time high.

I live in Germany and it's non existent here. The German people love cash. They don't even use credit cards. I can't speak for the rest of Europe but Germans are safe minded and they would rather spend their money on bread than digital assets. (Sidenote: I don't know anyone who invests in the German stock market either) 
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:12:04
It's all speculation but if I was banned from using exchanges I'd become a heavy duty HODL'er and I'd sell my first born to do it!

Hello! To tell you a little more about the belts, I buy a full hide of leather, cut, dye, burnish, and finish it all by hand. You are able to see, feel, and smell the difference between these belts and ones produced in a factory. The best part is, real quality leather looks better with age so the more you wear it the more of a store it tells!

If I'm not mistaken, Jack Dorsey and square payments first rolled out Bitcoin support in 2014 and were unsuccessful at the time due to lack of interest. It wasn't some luck filled epiphany he had last year.

I think Bitcoin is going to have a mad bull run in November leading up to the S2X fork. If that run starts at $6400 (Because this is a minor correction as you say and we're making new ATH's next week) we'll be around $9000 at the time of the fork and although I'm bullish I think it's more likely to enter November at around $5700 and finish up around $8300. Just my uneducated thoughts and yes I did sell for reasons stated above.

I was sitting at my computer with not much to do, reading about Bitcoin when my first order came through
Immediately I started to begin the production
but Bitcoin's price spiked and I felt sweet seduction
From Coinmarketcap to Reddit, what was the news?!? The Moon boys were pondering which color Lambo to choose
Now let's not forget it's not all about price,
but to make sure the politicians and bankers play nice 
But back to business with hard work and care
I made this for you to always cherish and wear
As I send off your belt Bitcoin's broken 8K,
buy what you can before it goes up, up and away!
