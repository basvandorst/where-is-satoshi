We are real early adopters. I am holding all my money in crypto and I live by it. When i need stuff i convert small amounts at the time. And even now i feel safer with my money in BTC then in fiat. I no longer belive in current money system.

I am reading this now, so I thought I would give you my input since that guy above is mad :) 
Bitcoin Core has SegWit but no GUI options. 
Bitcoin Core Team is open source meaning people work on things that they want to work on. There are meetings but in the end, you can force anyone to work on anything they dont want to :) SegWit is important feature but GUI option in BTC Core is not really important. 
Most people are using Core as node, like me, and using it as regular wallet is not very secure (since you need to use PC where you store keys - paper wallet, HW wallet or even clear phone are better imho) and its a hussle since every time you need to download rest of blockchain. 
For me personaly, I would love to have Core as node and dont need wallet in there anyway. 
People must get that Core is open source and that group of volunteers are coding the software. They dont have any real leadership which can enforce the work they do so only way to influence things is to go and code them. Otherwise there is not much point to criticize Core. The will do what they think its important and so far they have done the right things. Sometimes it may not be popular.

Hey so I havent seen anyone answering this so I might give it a go :) 
1) 12,5 BTC per block. At this point in time the blocks rewards are bigger. You can see 14,5 or even 17 btc per block now. As price increases, fees will increase too. Yes the fees will be much much more expensive. And thats ok. Because as reward diminishes you need incentives to keep the miners interested. at some point in future, block rewards will consist only from fees. 
2) Second layer solutions. Well these scale the number of transactions that is possible at single point in time. What you can expect are Proof of Stake systems ( like Lightning network is) to be pegged to BTC chain only because of secure proof of work system. That means you will make hundreds or thousands txs on another layer and then validate all of these txs on btc blockchain and then these txs will be securely validated. 
How will it work? Well thats really the milion dollar question, or more :D but let me give it a go. 
I think that BTC killer app is really the PoW system which will be in the end many years from now, only one PoW we will have. And we will use other currencies and systems to transact and then peg the transactions to BTC to be 100% sure of its safety. 
In LN there will be LN nodes - payment gates like VISA - that normal people can open. And these nodes will open payment channels to each other. They will open them with stake - some amout of BTC. And they will validate transactions and take fees based on number of btc transacted, just like it is now. Maybe 0,5%, maybe some other number. 
And after people fill this node up to its stake - when number of btcs that flow thru this node is the number of stake - then the node will make one big transaction from this and send it to base layer - btc blockchain. Where the fees are based on size of data, not number of BTCs. And that node will pay some big fee but that fee will be lower then the node got from validating the second layer transactions. 
And thats my vision. Lets see how will this play out :)

Never wait for dip. Cost-average is your friend
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:18:23
What he meant is that the Bitcoin as a system is more secure then banks. 
So the example is economic attack. To attack bitcoin you would need to pay billions of dolar at first and tens of millions every 10 minutes to keep the attack up - keep the coins. And at the moment you stopped attack, the coins you stole would lose value due to emergancy fix most likely.
You would need far less money to attack bank succesfully. 
I think its safe to say this is what he meant. 
Keep in mind that this is new tech and its not very usable in current form for some people and its not usable for most, since most people are not tech savvy. Bitcoin as a system is more secure - i have the same sentiment. Bitcoin is not very usable at the moment and its easier to lose money then in bank. This will change as more usable apps come to the network. Banks are too big and are not able to implement upgrades quickly and succesfully. In the end they will simply not be able to compete with the inovation. Well, they already are not able to compete. Give it 2-4 years and we will have easy to use app where you wont lose money. Thats the start of the true adoption.

I am looking for the comment one day. "Bitcoin died. And this is good for Bitcoin." ;D
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:02:53
Thats what I was thinking hoping someone could provide reasoning behind this :) it looks like burning money on fees to me.
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:24:16
Sorry, I was writing it on the toilet - as one does :D
So first of all there is reason why it is Bitcoin and not blockchain. To understand this I have to explain further.
"Blockchain" is a database on same level as SQL, MongoDB and other databases are. It has some strenghts and some weakneses. 
Blockchain is strong in keeping the "truth" in decentralized enviroment. In other words it keeps ledger in enviroment where the participants dont trust each other but they trust the blockchain because they contribute to it and can verify it. 
Blockchain is incredibly slow. So imagine that you can only write 7 new pieces of information to your database every second. Thats blockchain right now and even atfter years of optimization the number will not be in thousands. It will probably be in hundreds. Maybe. 
It is this slow because it needs to verify every single piece of information we write in it. And the verification is done by "miners" who are not really miners but they are "transaction managers" in a sense. They download new transactions from "Bitcoin servers" - decentralized nodes run by users - verify the transaction and send it back to "Bitcoin servers" which then verify the transaction with each other.
Point is - more miners there are - meaning more hashrate - more secure blockchain. Bitcoin blockchain has so much hasrate at this point that its probably not possible to attack it. Because you would need more computing power aka more hashrate then there is in the network. That means buying at least as much miners as are in the network and running them againts Bitcoin. This way you would choose which transactions would go through and which would not. You could make your own transactions and push them throught. This would cost billions of dolars for machines and tens to hundreds of milions every hour for eletricity. And at the second you would cease the mining, network would likely reverse to point before you started. Or it would be fixed other way, I dont really know. But the coins you mined/stole would have no value. That I am certain.
Point is - Bitcoin is more secure because it has huge mining power, it has estabilished network of nodes and most people are actively contributing code to it. 
Its completely decentralized - there is no single player that controls anything.
Its open - meaning open source -&gt; you can read every single line of code.
Concencus based - everyone has to agree with changes in the network. 
Proof of Work based - thats the mining which gives Bitcoin the last but very important layer of security. 
So remember. More miners - more security.
Now try this at bank. So bank makes private blockchain.
1) Only bank uses it. Its shit. Its slow and they actually dont need it. So the bank just shot itself in the foot so to speak. And help them god if someone hacks into the bank and finds which algo they are using and connects their miners to bank private blockchain. 
2) Only this bank and every other bank uses it. Since you need to verify transactions, you need miners. So every bank buys some miners and connects to the blockchain. How much miners should every bank buy? What if some bank buys more? What if one bank buys more then 50% of the network miners. Then it controls the blockchain. So there comes weapon race for most miners in the blockchain. And after that comes the hacker with halls of GPUs used for ethereum and he disrupts this for fun. 
Private blockchain will never work because Satoshi didnt invent it with this usage in mind. It was invented for specific purpose. Open, decentralized, concenzus based, proof of work (pow is up to debate even tho I debate strongly for pow).
Best piece of blockchain is Bitcoin because of its size and this will very likely continue. There is almost a 1000 developers contributing to BTC. There are tens of developers contributing to second largest blockchain - Ethereum. Bitcoin has most hashrate, most users, most developers, most security. 
This first layer of Bitcoin is all about security. And second layer Lightning Network is all about speed. And third layer will probably be all about routing so we will have our own TCP/IP in third layer. And then on fourth layer we will maybe have usable apps :D 
Its just long way away.
But all of it is Bitcoin. Not blockchain. Bitcoin will not go away. Good thing for banks is that they will be able to connect to Bitcoin and use it as security layer for their transactions in the end. After they try private blockchains and fail because they just dont see it now.

@_date: 2017-11-08 11:20:17
Thats true. All points. But as business owner mysleft, I am glad others try too. You make infrastructure now to accept Bitcoin and you can accept LTC and others too. Maybe some people will pay now but more will come in future and it will get easier as network grows stronger - faster. I think this is a lot about looking to the future and being prepared :) also its support to the technology.

Well 1,5 billion people live in first world country. 5,5 billion have limited access to internet, technology or banking services. They are the people bitcoin is made for. So it should be made accesible for them the best way possible. That is my subjective point of view at least.

In Czech Republic you can buy anything in our biggest retailer with BTC. From smallest things like batteries to Tesla car. And you can buy games on Steam with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:59:09
So im not sure if i will be able to do eli5 but lets try. 
Every block is a bucket. And transactions are sand. So in every bucket you can put only set amount of sand. And when it gets full, people pay higher fee so they can get their sand into the bucket. Also those who didnt get their sand in this bucket will try next one that is not so full.
With bigger bucket 2mb you can fit more sand in and the place is not so full so more pople get their sand into the bucket. Hence lower fees and lower transaction time.
But with that comes different price. You have to store the buckets, all of them! All history. That is called node. You store it on your pc. And everyone who wants can store it and help the network. But if buckets are too big, people can run out of space are would be forced buy new storage for it or just stop storing it at all. But you want more people to store history so its more decentralized - safe. 
Hope it helped.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:54:59
Well they kinda do because more bitcoin means more bytes which means more fee. We need second layer scaling tho because on chain scaling 100x or 1000x is not possible. Or maybe with some real advanced technology. Second layer proof of stake is way to go. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:51:20
I have never traded. Came to BTC with hodler mind set. But i do buy stuff with BTC when it is possible. And I buy BTC after. Its important to remeber that adpotion comes from use. And of course I hodl but if noone buys nothing with BTC then why would vendors ever want to enable BTC as payment method :) BTC is more then just currency, just remeber that. Everything you buy with bitcoin is investment in adoption. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:23:29
Hey, I will answer your question! It definetly is too complex for people at this stage. But keep in mind, we are maybe in 1/3 of the development of the technology. Things will get easier over time. But it will take years. We need to develop strong backend and then we can focus on front end side of things. As of now, its still experimental technology. People who do their research understand this. Those who just look for gains are the ones screaming about stuff that doesnt matter. Give it a few years or start coding yourself! If you make an app that makes it easier it will make you a lot of money! Thats how it works around here :)
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:33:17
I would give it some time. Thanks to ether blocktime it has a lot of problems with orphan blocks. And what do we know. Maybe rootstock running on top LN will give us instant resolutions without blocktime. Next 5 to 10 years will tell. Until then I am learning solidity so I will be ready :) 
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:06:00

As much as i like segwit and all. I dont think its segwits doing. If you check mempool for last 2 weeks you can see that number of transactions went down like 90%. In my opinion its much more likely that it was attack on network by someone who was burning a lot of money to press his propaganda *hint* *hint*. Segwit has capibility to help scale network up to 2.8x but only about 3% are using it atm. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:51:28
You cant cancel the transaction in the current system. It must be reseted out of mempool which can take a long time. Then it returns to your wallet. Best way is to check mempool webpage and decide from there. Core developers and preparing update that changes fee algorithm so it better reflects current situation. 
Biggest problem was there was tx spam last 3 weeks so all fees got higher. The scaling will always be the debate. Lightening Network is second layer scaling which will help to scale 1000x up to 1Bx. And even after that we will have scaling issues because we will use the network to full. If not by tx of bitcoin then by smart contracts, uploading cars, houses, ownerships, marriages or stuff noone has even invented yet. Its a wild ride. But we are sitting on it so we might aswell enjoy it. 99% people dont even know they are in queue yet :D
@_date: 2017-09-03 07:18:19
Exactly. These prections miss major point that we are not even at starting line of this technology. We are still preparing to run. Cleaning bugs, adding features. Every week someone comes up with awesome idea that if implemented is mind blowing. The possibility of 2nd layer scalibilities, adding sidechains, decentralized crypto exhanges and so much more. Im looking forward to what the network will look like in a year :)
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:11:29
The market depth wont take one large order. When you sell, you accept peoples orders in low quantites, each one lower and lower. Same as the price go up. Its risky to try manipulate market like this and the bigger market will be, the less people will be able to manipulate it.

Thats not what is bitcoin all about at all. Its protocol. Regulations are set within the protocol. If protocol allows it than its allowed. Whatever happens next will be teaching moment and bitcoin biggest strenght is that it will adapt and next time it wont be possible. Who you want to sue? People who use open source protocol in a way that it has been designed? Even if the design is not intentional? We will see what happens and people will likely lose money and we will all learn something new. This kind of bitcoin can hold safely 65B dollars. After this shitstorm and potentional update, meaning protection these attacks, next kind will be able to hold more. Maybe 200B dollars. Until next crisis and update. Neccesity is mother of invention. That is bases for this protocol. Dont give it help from outside. Let it fall over and over again until it learns to walk. Then run. And fly. It will be painfull. But its necessery for strong future system of money.

Hey i have a little farm. 30TH/s and i will keep mining core chain because i approve. And i run two core nodes too. That is my vote. And i belive a lot others will do the same. And there maybe a lot hashrate coming from china but there are a lot of farms all over the world with intention to stay. And if hashrate falls then more people with old rigs will step in because diff will fall too. I am not worried about hashrate. On the opposite. If jihan leaves the network we will have much more decentralized mining :)

If you think about it, EDA is really good for miners. When you have 2 chains you can freely change and force one chain to lower diff to almost zero and then mine it for 200 percent or more profit. As miner that mines only original I felt how the income went up and down. If you timed it right you would get more money. Most people like me just keep on old chain and dont bother. BCH is just playground for miners. Thats how it looks like when miners control the network. We just need people to be smarter. Or lose money and get smarter. Dont suport shitcoins. Do your research. Thats the lesson. Class has started.

You will have one btc on both chains. So when you send them on one chain, you will still have the other on other chain.
