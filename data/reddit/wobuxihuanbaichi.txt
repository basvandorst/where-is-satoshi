This is funny. In Asia you can sometimes buy a meal for 50 cents. And it looks like those fees a growing. Is this the low fees that r/btc is talking about? Bitcoin fees are ridiculous, but there won't be any mass adoption if fees are already at 50 cents.

He's not leading by being Satoshi, but whoever he is, he's certainly still working as a developer in the crypto world.

Read the AMA from the creator. Raiblocks could scale by updating the hardware.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:17:32
Raiblocks was developed by a dude working part-time. Visa is a multi billion dollar company. I don't see why there won't be a solution to scaling very soon. The race is on, because there are already cryptocurrencies that can do a number of tps 3 orders of magnitude higher than BTC.

A small loan in 1970s dollars please.

A private key.

Apparently we're both reading stuff about bitcoin's creation. Here is what he is refering to:

Can someone ELI5 what is going on here? I'm new to bitcoin and I don't understand much about this S2X drama. Thank you!

Reading this 5 months later :(

Same here. I sold around 7200, bought again around 6500. I'm sure some people managed to call the ATH, but I'm happy with what I did.

Maybe this guy has other addresses with thousands of bitcoins and he's using another one to buy his lambos? He seems to have made a couple of transactions of several thousand bitcoins in 2010.

Thank you, that makes sense. I like your concrete analogy. I would tip you with crypto if I had any idea how to do that.

That's also what I was thinking. Apart from his tweets, this guy doesn't exist. There is no information about him. We don't know where he lives (in the US, probably), we don't know anything about his job history. His name could be a pseudonym. He could very well be a die-hard Trump supporter, or he's just playing with us. Apart from retweeting right-wing tweets, has he written anything in support of the Republican party?
Edit: I take that back. I guess this thread answers my question:

GET protocol. They're already selling thousands of tickets in the Netherlands.
MOD is mass-producing sensors and marketing them to the pharma industry.

Lol you have no idea what a market cap is.

T'as ptêt pas de bitcoins, mais t'as une belle tirelire.

Deepl is even better as the other poster said. Try it, it's amazing. It was released a month ago. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:53:42
Especially if this guy is right. Even just 1 BTC would be amazing to have.

Finally something I can be a part of!

It doesn't really roll off the tongue unfortunately.

With Xi trying to push the anticorruption narrative, I wouldn't raise my hopes too high. Bitcoin still has a bad reputation among the public.
Anything that the communist party doesn't control tightly isn't something that they want.
