Maybe but trying to explain that to this subreddit is like getting blood from a stone. Stability doesn't mean you can't profit from a move in price, it simply means you have to use margin to compensate for the lack of volatility. Just look at fx, people can make a lot of money if they know what their doing but I suppose that's the problem here, most people in crypto don't know what they're doing and because of this they erode any half-decent fundamentals Bitcoin may have had for the sake of making a quick buck. Anyway c'est la vie!

A currency by definition is a medium of exchange that must remain reasonably stable in order to function as a trading foundation of goods and services in a financially progressive economy. Explain to me how Bitcoin fits this description. 
Short answer 'it doesn't'.

Definitely do not buy a Trezor or a Ledger nano used. In fact the best thing to do would be to buy it directly from their websites and avoid third-party sellers entirely even if you have to pay a premium. The whole point of a hardware wallet is to provide additional security to the user, so cheaping out from the get-go may cost you in the long run.

Just to be clear when I say today I mean 02/02/2018. I'm not American so my time zone is different.

As far as I know unless the hardware encased within the trezor has been compromised a simple firmware flash and a reset of the previous seed for a new one should suffice. However if you are considering buying a hardware wallet then you most likely have at least 0.1 btc in which case a few extra dollars to buy it new won't matter. Better to have peace of mind now than to always be worrying about whether somebody else has access to your wallet.

I highly doubt that will happen but who knows.

I said 'IF' we hit 10K implying we most likely wouldn't then we would drop. I don't know about you but I would say a $1500 drop is fairly hard wouldn't you. You criticize peoples predictions but haven't actually said anything yourself. In the end I made money and you sat there twiddling your fingers so stfu.

Ok. Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:25:40
The higher we go the harder we'll fall. Saw it with BTC and TRX's ridiculous rises so if we hit 10k we'll drop like a stone before we eventually recover.

If today's candlestick closes beneath $8700 then it would break the falling wedges real body to body candlestick support. This doesn't necessarily mean we will see 6-5.5k as it could be a bear trap (so don't panic), however, this would mark the first time since December a candlestick would have closed beneath the support. StochRSI is looking to bottom out soon with RSI also soon to enter oversold conditions on the daily timeframe hence why I think bearish momentum may stall for the time being. I stack my buys at supports, should they break I would then look for confirmation at the next support and buy again. 8500 and then 8000 (50/50 split) would be a good place to buy if your not willing to take the risk of anything lower. At the same time the market could change so take what I say with a huuuugeee grain of salt. If you can't read charts then I would simply buy anything below 8.5k and wait for bitcoin to breakout of the falling wedge.

Oh hold up. Your salty because you've been holding bitcoin during it's dip from 20k to here. Now it all makes sense.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:06:12
wtf are you talking about lol. I disagree with the the above analysis as well and think that we've hit rock bottom for now and should move up for the time being, however his argument is still perfectly valid if the charts back up what he says. Don't be so self-righteous and put other people down because you don't believe in what they're saying as that is pretty unhelpful too.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:57:28
Still being a cunt are we. Just accept people have opinions and move on smh.

I don't think the correction phase is over just yet. I believe it will settle nicely somewhere around the 8k support today with the possibility (at a stretch) of it hitting the mid 7000's before correcting back to somewhere between 9500 and 10100 in the next few days. If it closes beneath 8700 today then 6-5.5k would not be off the cards. As long as we never close beneath 8k (or at least recover the next day) during the falling wedge pattern we should see a bull run fairly soon. Note that i'm trading with USDT on Binance so you might want to account for the current difference between that and USD. Just my opinion though I could be completely wrong. Don't take my advice without doing your own research. SERIOUSLY!

And you were saying? ;)
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:54:23
I'm not saying we'll drop to 5k mate, i'm just saying that 10k is such a strong resistance we will most probably correct again. I'd wager 7k will be as far as we fall however if you want to believe bitcoin will rise from here on out good luck to you. IMO we are not done yet ;)

Maybe they were simply highlighting a weakness in the current rally. A balanced opinion is better than a biased one which is clearly something this sub is yet to fully understand. In fact the persistent optimism feels a lot more like desperation which to be honest doesn't really help your case for widespread adoption very much. Might be better to just shut up and let people think for themselves without forcing the words 'moon', 'hodl' and 'lambo' down their throats every five seconds.

If short sellers were really 'trying to get out of the game' they would be buying (longing) to close out their positions and pay back the margin they borrowed, not selling. Judging by the volume it's more likely hesitation from the bulls since this is the third time they have been rejected from the 8200 mark. It seems everyone is counting on some big whale to come to their rescue and push prices up without really looking at the charts to form a second opinion.

This is what Bitcoin needs. Stability. Without it, it fails at everything. If only it could stay this way then we may have something to work with. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:54:50
If this turns out to be a PnD then it will further solidify the fact that Bitcoin is incapable of becoming a currency.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:36:57
It depends. Since most alts are traded on a crypto to crypto basis, with btc pairings accounting for the most volume, a sudden rise in btc would cause a sudden rise in the dollar value of an alt coin/token regardless of its satoshi value. Market sentiment may either agree or disagree with this new valuation and will react accordingly. For example, the market may feel that a certain alt coin/token is now overpriced and will correct its satoshi value to a point by which its dollar value seems more reasonable. Generally speaking though, the better/more unique/more useful the project is the more encouraging its reaction will be to a bullish move in bitcoin, although frankly it's pretty hard to know this until after the fact has occurred hence the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

Your bitcoin wallet address is not expended upon first use. You may continuously transact bitcoin, either through sending or receiving, without needing to generate a new wallet address. Hopefully this helps clear up any confusion.
