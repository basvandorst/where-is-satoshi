Good analogy!  To add a little detail about how real estate transactions are recorded, they are actually really easy to find if the system is used properly.  Every page of every transaction document is recorded with a Book and Page number, i.e. when you prepare a deed from Bob to Charlie, you take it down to the Registry where they officially enter it into the system in the order in which it is received, giving it a Book and Page number as it goes in.  
The question of course is how to prove that Bob really owned the property - and how that's done in real estate is that when you prepare a new deed, you reference the Book and Page of the previous deed from when Bob bought the property from Fred or whoever owned it before him.  
When Charlie buys the property he'll take out a mortgage, which is also recorded with its own book and page number, and will reference the book and page of the deed where Charlie bought it from Bob.  When he pays off the loan they'll record a release or discharge of the mortgage, referencing the book and page from when the mortgage was recorded.
It's a pretty cool system that works pretty well, even as old as it is.  There's a whole industry of Title Agents who search through the registry for any straggling or incomplete transactions and provide Title Insurance in case someone out there has either a claim or lien on a property before you buy it.
(note:  different states use terms other than Deed, Mortgage, Release, etc but the concepts are all similar.  
Note 2: properties are not given a number to identify them, but instead will have a surveyor's description attached saying it's X feet from road Y, 100' on the east side, 120' on the north, etc.  These can be pretty fun to read through in older parts of the country, they get pretty creative and are a cool slice of history.)
