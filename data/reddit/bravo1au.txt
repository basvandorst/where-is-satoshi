What fascinates me is that the most important and least talked about part of the chart is the top right corner. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:51:46
1.  They can’t spell. 
2.  We are likely somewhere near the point of maximum opportunity. 
3.  In any case, importantly the second peak is higher than the first. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:20:55
You mean consensus:)
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:52:14
Not sure wether to laugh or cry. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:55:35
It sounds like you are interested enough so I would say yes. Start small and don’t risk too much, get a feel for things like the risks of difficulty adjustment, algo forks. You can always scale later.   Consider your other mining options, ASICS, shit coins, FPGA’s. I’d say don’t even look at GPUs - unless you already are in that game and are considering accelerating them. There is a new generation of btc ASICS coming soon.  
The market is obviously very low right now, you need to put the work in to get a return that justifies the high risk. 
Good luck!

Now that’s more like it.  
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:00:41
Know where I’d rather be :)
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:52:23
Hey thanks for sharing your story. I’m also sorry to hear about your friend. Life happens and it’s only money. It’s great that you are true to what you believe in.  Good luck with your future.

It’s lots of retailers at the airport and all through fortitude valley in Brisbane. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:43:14
Really?  That’s what you got out of that?
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:57:19
Here it’s 1.5% transaction fee, $0.10 per swipe plus the terminal lease cost of $90 per month. Then there is the delay to receive the funds. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:29:32
Definitely start populating the locations. If you have addresses we can geocode the missing ones. What’s the best communication channel for you?
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:18:42
Ok. Since you asked.  
TCPIP. UDP. SMTP. POP etc. 
All first mover protocols. 
Are there better, faster, cheaper, more efficient alternatives?  Yep. Guess what ... they’re still  at what they do (power the internet). 
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:16:47
I’ll check it out too, might be able to help with the map. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:27:24
Welcome to the club. HODL. :)
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:18:33
Awesome. Love your work. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:29:29
Those comments are priceless 
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:18:46
Batting above your average buddy. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:21:51
I love how you roll 
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:44:32
Agreed. To be honest I’m enjoying the break from the hype. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:09:05
Hi mate. Post your wallet address. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:11:33
And for a double spend only. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 08:56:41
The comments in this post are refreshingly soothing. Nice.!
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:23:05
Patience. The first 50% is the worst. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:40:25
Agreed and nicely explained. Why don’t more people get this?
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:08:39
Nice timing. Wish you the best of luck. Stay away from shitcoins :)
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:46:47
Why optimal?  TCPIP routing isn’t always optimal and seems to be doing just fine. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:33:32
Take comfort in that you are not alone. At this point in the market cycle your feelings are normal.  Accept that nobody knows what is actually going to happen, well no one posting here anyway.  But I would suggest that those that are really successful don’t follow the herd, and back themselves. That can be because you believe in market cycles, crypto, the failure of fiat, institutional manipulation, or the revolution. What do you actually believe?  Set a plan. Act on it. If it goes south we’ll then at least you followed your beliefs rather than what everybody else did. Is this the bottom?  Don’t know - but the herd sentiment is clear right now. Is that a buy or sell signal for you?
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:58:38
You’d think so. But wechat is absolutely huge!  Facebook know they will be too.
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:46:55
Nice work. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:19:01
Great article, fun read.
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:20:24
Nice thoughts and ideas there.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:55:52
Nice one thanks for the story. Best of luck. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:27:55
It’s actually a pretty good piece. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:31:05
I feel like the quality on YouTube is higher though. Except for the comments. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:49:35
It seems a bit strange patenting something that sits on top of open source. They’ve heard of lightning right?
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:07:26
That’s awesome.  I’m already wearing my snorkel. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:06:33
I’m definitely not getting an iwatch. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:45:40
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:03:57
You lost me at ‘put it in a savings account for interest’. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:36:56
That’s awesome 
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:43:30
Awesome thanks will do. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:39:23
And the argument usually ignores the renewables/green % like in Iceland and the cases where the mining heat I used to heat peoples homes in cold climates. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:58:51
Haha yes but there’s some great stuff there too. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:27:09
We clearly both  have different investment timeframes. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:46:56
I’m cold storage - would love to know how you are timelocked?
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:01:37
I agree. I’ve got lots of friends that since crypto have learnt a lot about markets, returns and a general interest in money. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:10:02
Well done, keep using and thanks for helping the network. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:02:42
That’s misleading. It’s not centralised when you can open another channel with any node in the network directly. Try it for yourself, add a  node and capacity. Do something positive for the community. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:50:31
That’s awesome love your work. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:56:21
Agreed, but it’s not just ‘some guy’. It’s one of the biggest bookmakers here (au) with resources and reputation. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:07:21
Whatever you choose, make sure you have control of your keys. BRD allows this, but no segwit :(.   I use both actually, Blockchain web wallet version is sometimes handy when I need to copy and paste an address into a website.  For your HODL by yourself a ledger or similar and his keep spending money on web/mobile wallets. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:03:08
More reading less shilling 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:40:20
Where do you live?  Btc acceptance in cafes and restaurants is huge where I live. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:12:55
Mastering bitcoin   has all the answers you need. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 23:31:05
Why open and close a channel for a beer?  You understand that you don’t need a direct channel right?  I’m using lightning have 3 channels left open and finding I have plenty of connectivity with the network so far. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:55:02
I recall something in the LND docs about node clusters, might be useful for you. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:19:10
Well you could start here. 
Read the white paper
And then spin up a wallet / node and start using it to really understand/learn.  Mind you, I’ll be first to admit it’s pretty tricky at first and not exactly release grade software:).  But get your head around it and it will blow your mind. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 20:59:58
Sorry missed the /s!
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:20:10
What noose?  Formalising KYC that the exchanges were already doing anyway?  
It great for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:34:22
Hmm. You know that LN channels can stay open and that the channels are routable right?  And what’s with 3?  Have you been watching BCash YouTube’s....?

Hashpower. The most secure distributed data store in the history of humanity. Immutable. Decentralised.  Valuable. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:36:46
Nice pic 
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:57:52
MySpace wasn’t a protocol. Heard of tcpip or smtp.  They were first.   Are there better internet or email protocols?  Of course. Does it matter? Nope.  
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:25:30
Yep I’ll contribute to that. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:54:10
Agree. Hashpower and it’s role in immutability seem to be forgotten when comparing with alts.
