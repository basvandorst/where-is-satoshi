I'm really having a hard time trying to think of a place where it would be totally confusing whether ฿ meant bitcoin or a Thai currency that nobody's ever heard of or knows the symbol for. If anything, the Baht is in danger of completely losing its symbol mindshare, not the other way around.

Hey, a Gibson fan! Have you been listening to his life story on Triangulation that they've been putting out recently? Really awesome stuff.
Also, I'm just waiting for one of the Gibson haters to show up, start screaming "charlatan!" and post a link to that stupid, vitriolic website that just lists people some guy doesn't like, one of whom is Steve.

The more I learn, the more Mt Gox's announcements sound like this:

I think he has it exactly backwards, actually. It's the introduction of digital currency that will push software further out into the realm of autonomy than anything that's come before.

The words "intrinsic value" have no intrinsic value.
It kinda boggles my mind that people bandy that phrase around when it comes to money. By being accepted as a representation of value by a network of people, *anything* instantly transcends whatever "intrinsic value" it has. Investment firms don't buy gold in order to use it for its interesting physical and chemical properties.
People seem to believe that, somehow, it's the tiny percentage of people making gold leaf and gold-plated cable connectors that prop up the entire value of gold. This is false. It's the network of people who value gold. Value is a belief. When people believe something has value, it does.
Gold, fiat, bitcoin, words – all of these things have intrinsic properties, but we derive the majority of their value *extrinsically.* You'd think people whose lives revolve around money would have figured this out by now.

I'm with you. The initial adoption phase is certainly being dominated by a certain set of political tendencies. A lot of people seem to think that the "point" of bitcoin is to essentially prop up a few anarcho-libertarian ideals ("down with the man!" and the like). I couldn't disagree more with that.
For me, bitcoin's about not having any single viewpoint dominating the ecosystem. We're working to make it into something *anybody* can use, regardless of class, creed, culture or worldview. The current anarcho phase is just that: a phase. In its stead, we'll see the blossoming of true diversity and playing field leveling.
That's the bitcoin I see.

Yeah, here's a conversation that will never happen:

[Here's the video]( for anyone who'd rather watch Lawsky make these remarks.
I would encourage people to actually watch or read the speech before forming an opinion.

That's pretty cheap for a 2 br in Manhattan. Which is why I don't live in Manhattan.

The security design of the trezor is actually quite similar to the iPhone's Touch ID system. Namely, everything is locked away in a specialized piece of hardware that takes care of all fingerprint processing in its own little world. The only thing the rest of the phone (and the outside world) can do is query it for a few basic functions.
So, yeah, I think we could see something like this in a smartphone someday. However, that would require an incredible amount of work to do well in a completely integrated manner in a smartphone. 
My prediction: we'll see pluggable bitcoin devices for smartphones before we see it integrated into smartphones. Imagine just buying a little band that you plug into the bottom of your phone and then holding it in place with a specialized, somewhat enlarged case. You set up the transaction on your phone, then you confirm it on the strip.

The Gibson episodes are the only Triangulations I've seen. Steve has a million insane stories to tell, so it's a must listen.
I kinda liked the new host for TNT until the whole Dorian Nakamoto debacle happened. It really soured me on his reliability when he kept claiming that Newsweek had "really done their homework" or some such. Made me think that if that's this guy's idea of good journalism, I sure as hell can't take any of his other reports seriously.
I'm always glad when Steve touches on the subject of bitcoin, though. He's really unbiased and only in it for the love of the technology. It helps balance out the somewhat infuriating perspective that Leo tends to take towards the subject.

It was an out of context quote from a flustered, post-stroke, aging man whose native language is not English in response to some hurried questions spat at him by a heartless journalist who smelled blood.
Do you really need more?

To add to that, one of the most important resources in the bitcoin space right now is something that you have to earn by proving your value and reliability over time: reputation. By really taking the time to develop a userbase and, more importantly, earn the trust of the community, Blockchain.info will easily be able to transition into more directly lucrative ventures in the future. Any new business without such a glowing reputation would be burdened by the initial suspicion and uncertainty that this wild environment merits while fighting to draw its first profits.

Someone's a Leo Laporte listener. It's a great mantra.

Yeah, mostly the tech guy. It's like he's on a loop sometimes when he gets a run of people who didn't backup their data properly.
