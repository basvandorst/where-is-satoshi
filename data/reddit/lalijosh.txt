I agree with the name. However, I disagree with using it to represent a satoshi. BTC, mBTC, uBTC, satoshi, etc. are all good for representing the absolute amount of bitcoin you own. What we need is something that represents how much bitcoin you own adjusted for deflation. 
I propose we use *bit* to represent whatever the minimum low-priority transaction fee is. Right now, that would be 0.0001 BTC so 1 bitcoin would equal 10,000 bits. As the price of bitcoin rises, we multiply the value of bits/bitcoin by ten. So it would eventually represent a satoshi before moving on to even smaller values. 
*Bit* would kill two birds with one stone by always being a practical way of representing prices and by keeping the minimum transaction fee from being too high. 
*Bit* has been used as a name for currency of little value for hundreds of years before computers. I don't think there will be any confusion. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:58:24
The satoshi is just another arbitrary fraction. What we should do is create a name that represents whatever the minimum transaction size is at the time and use that to communicate how much we own.
I propose using the name "bit". Centuries before computers the name "bit" was used in different parts of the world for currency of little value. I say we resurrect it.
As the value of bitcoin increases, programmers would only need to keep up with the value of bits per bitcoin which should only be increased by factors of ten. 
We would solve this problem and the minimum transaction size problem in one step.

Some payment processors are pickier than others. When I worked in customer service (not for Coinbase), I would always recommend people call the bank that issued their credit card.

I just launched a Bitcoin Christmas giving game, [An Elf Has Your Wealth](
It uses address signing to prove that you own the Bitcoin but you keep the funds. The game is played for any number of years beginning and ending on Christmas day. You are one of Santa's elves who is going to look after your friend or family member's gift from Santa until it is ready. 
My website watches the block chain and updates the gift recipient with the current value of the gift by email every year on Christmas day. Over the years, they'll see your modest gift grow into a fortune and will eagerly anticipate the Christmas when they get their hands on it.
If, at any time, you spend the gift, you get a week to replace it before the gift recipient gets an email from Santa Claus telling them that the elf went rogue and absconded with it. They will then shame you into restoring their gift. 
But, if you hold onto their gift until the end of the game, you then transfer the funds to them, and they thank you profusely for their new fortune. 
I hope you find it useful but, either way, I would appreciate hearing any feedback you might have.
Merry Christmas!

I've got a couple of ideas that I'm working on. Hopefully I won't go broke before I complete them. Without giving too much away: the threat of credit card chargebacks prevents some business models from working because they would be too risky. With bitcoin, it's still an immediate digital transaction but you can treat it like cash and skip some of the fraud prevention measures like capturing and verifying customers' addresses. This opens up possibilities that weren't there before.

Contact the bank that issued your card. Have the representative spell your name and address exactly as they have it in their system. For example, is it "st." or "street"? Sometimes they have the wrong address or have misspelled it. Different payment processors are pickier than others.

Inspired by all the questions about giving Bitcoin as a Christmas gift, I have worked hard this past week to code a Bitcoin gifting game. Today, I am launching it and I am asking for your feedback.
The game is called An Elf Has Your Wealth and it differs from other ways to gift Bitcoin. Rather than give your friends, family, or coworkers the Bitcoin right away, you hold onto it for them for a set number of years. My website tracks the address in the block chain to keep you from spending it. It also sends the recipient of your gift an email every Christmas letting them know how much it is worth.
As the years pass by, they will notice how much it is increasing in value eagerly anticipating the Christmas when the game will end and they will get to spend their fortune.
I hope finds the game a useful way to increase awareness of Bitcoin and I look forward to reading your comments.
Merry Christmas!

The United States owes more than the GDP. The government doesn't pay for anything from taxes. It finances spending and pays off less than spends every year. This is called the deficit. 
Each year the deficit gets added to the debt. But each year we spend more and pay off less. This increases the deficit and *accelerates* the growth of the debt. 
The government uses something called "baseline budgeting." What this means is every program or department's budget has built-in increases every year whether they need more money or not. When you ever hear a politician talking about "cuts", "drastic cuts", or "draconian cuts", they're talking about cuts in the *rate* of increase year to year. But the amount of money spent on something never goes down.
I'll repeat that again: THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON SOMETHING, EVEN WHEN "CUT", NEVER GOES DOWN.
So we're like a family that owes more than it makes in a year. We put everything on the credit card. Every item in our budget increases every year. And we cannot even stomach the thought of decreasing the *rate* that each item increases each year. 
In other words, we are fucked. 
The United States has no intention of *ever* paying off the debt.

There is no good reason to "recover" lost coins. Bitcoin could work if only 1 BTC were left. It's infinitely divisible.

I'm actually working on this now. And you nailed it. Amazon wishlists let you mail gifts to people without them having to disclose their address. The Bitcoin tip bot can withdraw to any address so it could be used to purchase the gifts.

When 1 BTC is worth $10,000, I don't think we'll need to convert to fiat any more for most things.

1. Set aside how much you are going to gamble with *before* you start. 
2. Don't set aside more money than you can afford to lose. 
3. If you lose all your money, stop. Don't get more money out.
4. Losses are immediate and permanent. Winnings are only winnings if you have left the casino with them. 
5. Don't gamble too much too quickly. Lose as slowly as possible creating more opportunities to win big once or twice. 
6. If, at any point, you find yourself with more money than you started with, stop.  
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:37:17
If you receive bitcoin from someone through ebay, what is there to keep you from reversing the transaction and keeping both your money and the bitcoin? The delays and limited transaction options help the exchanges prevent theft and fraud.

I'm not sure what space colonists have to do with NASA, an organization who's stated primary mission is "to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science ... and math and engineering."

I just launched a Bitcoin Christmas giving game, [An Elf Has Your Wealth](
It uses address signing to prove that you own the Bitcoin but you keep the funds. The game is played for any number of years beginning and ending on Christmas day. You are one of Santa's elves who is going to look after your family member's gift from Santa until it is ready. 
My website watches the block chain and updates the gift recipient with the current value of the gift by email every year on Christmas day. Over the years, they'll see your modest gift grow into a fortune and will eagerly anticipate the Christmas when they get their hands on it.
If, at any time, you spend the gift, you get a week to replace it before the gift recipient gets an email from Santa Claus telling them that the elf went rogue and absconded with it. They will then shame you into restoring their gift. 
But, if you hold onto their gift until the end of the game, you then transfer the funds to them, and they thank you profusely for their new fortune. 
I hope you find it useful but, either way, I would appreciate hearing any feedback you might have.
Merry Christmas!

I had the same problem with Wells Fargo years ago and closed my account. If you want to reliably receive your paychecks, open a checking account with the same bank your employer uses. I do this and the funds are available in my account Thursday night, a day quicker than employees that use other banks. You can then transfer funds to whatever bank you prefer to use.
