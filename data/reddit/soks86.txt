He owned the company. He paid himself with, allegedly, customer funds. You could give yourself all your companies money to pay yourself a 'good salary,' doesn't mean you're not stealing and committing fraud in the process. 
I would say such a claim is akin to saying "that car thief has some nice cars" because he "pays himself well", by simply walking outside and taking people stuff. It's not legal what Karpeles did and I'm shocked they can't figure it out well enough to do anything about it. I hope this is justice moving slowly rather than justice not served.

It should absolutely be illegal to knowingly facilitate criminal activities.

I NEVER realized that these were bait/switch situations and not simply ineptitude on the part of GOX. 
If they never had the coin to make everyone whole of course they'd do everything they can to get their hands on other people's coins. I'm sure there will be more to the GOX story after bankruptcy, unless Mark destroyed all the forensic evidence already there should be trail. 
Then again... MF Global went down and clients were only made 80% whole by exchange rules, not actual money being returned (afaik). That was a regulated company that's been around for &gt;100 years...
edit: changed "made whole" to "made ~80% whole", also though clarify that my point is no legal action was taken, though the situation was a bit different (MF Global wasn't an exchange but a broker and clearing firm).

I always transfer my coins to Coinbase and then to my bank account from there. They claim to have a 50k daily sell limit. I personally have only done ~2k per day, that's both buying and selling. I don't see why they would have an issue with 10k, the daily limit being 50k you should be able to move 100k in 2 days. 
They calculate "days" in seconds or minutes from when you did your purchase , that is, exactly 24 hours after selling 50k you should be able to sell exactly 50k more.

Ah, true, finance was the wrong word. Facilitating is the word I was looking for. He's in trouble for knowingly facilitating the laundering of money seems like a reasonable paraphrasing. 
It's as if visa helped explain to you how you can avoid their security measures to purchase an illegal amount of check cards to give to people who go to a black market to buy their goods.

I concur with TacoT. This was the first time I saw Brock Pierce, saw this video weeks ago and Jon Matonis is nowhere in it, and didn't realize he was the Bitcoin Association guy so I watched without bias. I felt he is a little chatty maybe but clearly he's excited and knowledgeable. Knowing he's a gil seller makes me question his qualifications but overall he seems alright. Better than Charlie and Krepeles as far as I can tell.
He wasn't convicted and while we should keep in mind what happened we can't burn him at the stake for it. We publicize such matters in America, and I like that over the alternative, but I think we should take seriously the fact he was not convicted and, as far as I'm aware, the outcome of the case isn't considered suspicious. 
Edit; Mike Milken, hahah, yeah I stopped watching any more videos from this place after I looked him up on Google.
Edit, edit; Maybe I'm being too hard on Milken, people change, I think this is the same place Akon was talking about Bitcoin. Overall it seemed good for Bitcoin publicity.

Merriam Webster also defines specie as "money in coin" so I wouldn't go trusting them to define economic terms. 
In response to the spirit of your comment in general Bitcoin is itself the specie, thus it is not fiat. Bitcoin is a commodity, the CFTC is accurate in suggesting it falls under their jurisdiction, which is fully fungible and thus works well as a form of exchange though the fluctuating value, so far, makes it a bit more difficult to use as a currency.

I disagree that he was a nice kid. I used BitInstant on a regular basis and after about a dozen transactions I only received part of my money from one. 
I inquired with their support staff, something I was familiar with doing and had not had an issue with. The staff was very slow to respond this time around and after several days Charlie replied and accused me of stealing money from them and demanded I send back their money. I offered to have Mt. GOX and BTC-e (the two exchanges between which I was exchanging money) send him what they see on their ledger, proof that I didn't have his money. 
He insisted I was a thief and that I wasn't offering any solutions to the problem. I promptly stopped doing business with or communicating with BitInstant. 
I am offended that Charlie is part of the Bitcoin Foundation and I have viewed the foundation with skepticism because he's there. I'm happy about this news, one less Pirateat40 type in the community. No, I'm not suggesting Charlie ran a ponzi, just that he's the type of fool who lies and possibly worse.

Ah, yes, agreed. I thought the implication was employees taking opportunity from traders. Good point on no evidence.
That said, tether is the antithesis of BTC so I can't wait for it to be over.
We cannot imagine up liquidity by trusting a single centralized party.
If anything this is what derivatives are for and in that case the good exchanges regulate themselves more than the feds in an attempt to keep markets healthy. Not to mention that you don't directly mess with the asset when you use derivatives since any "pretend money" is stuck away from the real spot markets.
Edit; "pretend money" was a lousy term to randomly invent, I mean to say that the leverage granted by derivative market exchanges  isn't applied directly to spot (cash/currency based) markets. God I hope there aren't fools on localbitcoins trading coin for tether.

True, and equally as illegal if your intent in placing those orders is to affect the price.

Actually an old trick that has always been illegal but which has, rather recently, begun being prosecuted.
@_date: 2018-11-08 04:29:00
The charges this guy was facing were specifically for order spoofing and order spoofing is how the markets were manipulated.
Order spoofing is possible in any market represented by an open limit order book, possibly more so when you show lots of depth (like BTC markets and unlike CME). Spoofing rules have only been on federal books for a very short time and this is some of the early fallout from the feds going after these folks.
This has nothing to do with BTC aside from maybe raising awareness that order spoofing is a crime that folks do get prosecuted for in the US.
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:41:45
I feel ya there, and in many ways it is an unsolvable issue. Thankfully the cases that actually damage markets are more easily provable than benign ones.
When these charges originally came out (there were at least 7 other entities charged) I thought the entire thing was nonsense. If you look at the actual order flow that was found during investigations it becomes very apparent these people were manipulating the markets (over the very short term) and it's not the sort of behavior anyone can get away with. Yes, in one of the cases the evidence included a trader admitting to such behavior and bragging about it.
Exchanges protect from this (without investigating intent) by just setting a limit on how many orders you can place without getting filled. So, for example, if you place 100 orders and less than 10 are filled then you are in violation and get a fine. I'm not sure on the details of why but these sort of check weren't enough so federal laws were expanded to allow prosecutors to pursue such cases. In fact one of the defendants sat on a panel that advised the government on this expansion (reality stranger than fiction).
If you look at the actual investigations that are done the order flow they uncover has glaring issues and doesn't require any evidence of intent beyond what is already apparent. Flashing 10x the volume of the entire book is NOT a trading strategy, placing large orders and cancelling shortly after filling small orders on the opposite side is NOT a legal trading strategy, writing code that avoids ever getting filled is NOT a legit trading strategy, and so on.
I know the taste is bad with "intent" in there but, unless we want to pursue thought crimes, proving intent by available evidence, sometimes statements, is pretty common in law enforcement. At least so I've gleaned from crime shows and limited real life exposure.
Yes, there are many traders who place orders for not-the-most-legit reasons but there are only so many that intrinsically tie their trading strategy to such a tactic and then follow through methodically placing orders that they never want to fill.

I meant that I have no further information to speculate why Apple is suddenly refusing this request. Their given reasons don't really make sense, I agree with the DoJ, and I'd love to know more but I simply don't. 
My theorizing isn't as to why the government wants to bust Mr. Jun Feng, who is allegedly a methamphetamine producer/distributor, but why Apple has decided to not unlock his phone. It might have something to do with the case, the warrant, or perhaps who Mr. Feng is. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:30:14
Odd. The article makes statements that don't agree with the legal document they link to. 
Per the document Apple claims "two reasons not to compel its assistance now: it invokes the costs associated with devoting
employee time to bypassing passcode-locked iPhones involved in criminal activity and
potentially to testifying in federal court"
The document goes on to explain that Apple has helped the government do this before. It also goes on to state that the government is willing to compensate Apple for employee time spent on this work and that in no prior case has an Apple employee had to testify.
I feel like almost all journalism out there is a big pile of fail. Maybe it would be better to say that from what I've seen a majority of journalism is terrible, just awful.
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:22:26
The specific situation they're referring to cannot apply to open source repositories because the purpose of the licensing is exactly the opposite. As a distributor of open source software you provide no warranty and while you do hold the user to your license it is not for your interests in the same way that Apple holds license for their interests. 
Apple wants control over how you use the software while an open source license is the opposite in most ways.
It should be pointed out that the DoJ cites many cases in the document that seem to suggest this standard applies regardless of licensing and the licensing argument is only used to prove that Apple has an interest in all of their customers phones. Since they have an interest and are thus actively involved in these phones then they should be part of figuring out how to access the phones when a warrant is issued to search one. Similar to how a phone company that provides telecommunications connectivity can be compelled into helping when their lines are being used for criminal activities. 
Now if you release some software with an open source license and somewhere down the line someone uses it to commit a crime I think they would have a hard time arguing that you have anything to do with the situation. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:06:32
Lol.

@_date: 2015-10-24 01:32:53
This was a small part of their arguments. In their examples of similar cases they bring up several situations where telephone companies were compelled to assist in various situations and none of them talked about whether or not hardware/software was licensed.
The reference to licensing software was to make the point that Apple does this to retain legal and physical (electrons) control of devices and thus shows they have an "interest" in the device. Since they have an interest in the device they are not "far removed" from it and thus it should be reasonable for them to be compelled to assist in recovering data from the device. 
Apple CAN access the software and is simply saying "no" after stringing the government along. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:10:32
Yes they can, sure they can, remember horsebonerfart or whatever it was with Bitcoin. If you password is a 4 digit code you can brute force it. People aren't typing in 256bit keys to unlock their devices, more like &lt;32bit keys. 
edit: you said reasonable, perhaps a 4 digit key is not 'reasonable,' but I don't think most phones are protected all that well from brute force attacks. My laptop is fully encrypted but my password is 8 characters. If the NSA got it I imagine it would only take them so long to loop through all combinations and hack it even through the underlying encryption uses a 2048bit key. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:37:49
Because boingboing is making inaccurate statements.
The government is simply saying that since Apple goes so far as to not allow people to own their software they have a clear interest in the devices their customers own. Due to this interest they should be compelled into assisting with criminal investigations, as they and others have done in the past. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:44:00

Apple seems to keep keys, yes. They do this regularly and only require a properly (per their terms) worded request to a court when investigators are obtaining a warrant.
Not for iOS8 on newer hardware (which uses hardware encryption, I'm guessing) but on all other iOS versions and on 10% of iOS8 devices (per Apples own claims).
The whole thing seems sensationalist. I'm curious as to why Apple is suddenly refusing...

The law has to apply to people, if it doesn't I would simply kill those I don't like and so on and the last people alive would be the biggest, cleverest, or most dangerous. It sounds like you're suggesting lawlessness and that just doesn't work. (EDIT) Okay, maybe not lawlessness if you do a decentralized force thing, but again I strongly believe this would not work due to corruption being easier in a free market. 
I do a lot of work in financial markets and my favorite (CME) self regulates for the most part and in most (all?) cases their regulations are more strict than their regulator (CFTC). But the bad guys still try to cheat or, worse, they simply avoid the CME so they can do what they want. AIG for example, taking the buy side of ALL insurance contracts on ALL insured securitized mortgages created a huge huge huge market of what should have been fraud. Guess what, the CFTC chairperson in 1999 argued to Congress that this has to stop by allowing the CFTC to regulate it but Congress was convinced (by some bad apples who were actually part of Obama's and Bush's administrations) to let it happen. This market is now regulated and part of the CME where it always should have been and where a player like AIG would never be allowed to do what they did which would have prevented banks from doing what they did. 


Regarding how they transact; I don't believe I said anything about that and I agree with you that such a thing should not be government controlled. Not sure what 'how' means exactly. If how means 'by what means' I can see there being an issue with using a person as currency, though that would likely be covered by not applying sovereignty to all people. I'm not sure what else how means, I think it is an issue that we're expected to use USD when transacting with each other, though I believe barter is legal so the whole thing is silly as shit because barter is (economically) equivalent to another currency, so I believe I agree with you. There might be something bad about allowing us to transact with another nations currency that I have never considered, or read about, but I would argue that if that's the case BTC belongs to no nation so :P
Note; the US government requiring tax payments in USD seems reasonable to me and allows the float value between USD/BTC to actually represent the worthiness of our country, etc, etc. 




Umm, I dunno about you but I mostly do whatever I want. I have local issues, CPD isn't perfect but that's due to Chicago being a mess, Illinois state legislature is a mess... but overall I do mostly what I want and conduct business freely. If I want change I can work on that but it's not so bad that I have to. 
Also, my success doesn't seem to be ruining anyone else's life so I'm not forcing slavery on anyone nor is it being forced on me. Though I am starting to feel a bit funny around minimum wage folks knowing their life is a bit too tough right now given market prices vs their wage. 
Edit: One thing that helped me come to terms with our judicial system was reading Yale's law journal. It's not really that hard to understand as they usually explain the importance of cases they reference. There is a large focus in legislation and adjudication in preventing fraud, malice, and finding reasonable solutions to social problems. It's just that this is really really hard to do when lots of people are involved and the bad apples tend to gain power (psychopaths being good at manipulation). Yes, there are legislators who are being paid off to stop things like Bitcoin, but more likely they're being convinced by other powerful people (particularly in business where a psychopath has an easier time than in say law where they have to learn shit) that Bitcoin is the enemy. I think it's best to find small things to change or prevent about society than to try anything drastic. It is much easier to convince powerful people that Bitcoin will provide stability through honest to goodness price discovery and access to high-yield savings vehicles for the masses than to talk about anarchism with them.

@_date: 2015-10-24 04:00:15
I don't agree. These terms, centralization, decentralization, monopoly, and competitiveness are not related to each other in such simple ways. They can be applied to totally different topics (centralization of monetary control, centralization of force) and can manifest in different ways as well (competition between businesses, competition between land owners, competitions between lovers). None are simply equal or lead to the others. 
We have a market economy, competitive, which has many different regulators, centralized, operating to ensure various things from quality of goods, safety, open competition, etc. Regulators, which are centralized entities, can be mechanisms for ensuring competitiveness and fairness. 
I am against the argument that a decentralized mechanism of force is a good idea. If police or judicial enforcement is decentralized then market forces will control it and market forces are fallible, especially given that they are governed, in part, by the masses. In this case, the boingboing referenced case against Jun Feng, centralization is in the power of our justice system to apply rules of law to a person. This case is not about the centralization of control of capital as we have with our fiat money system. The claims made by boingboing that we're on some slippery slope of licensing being used to force encryption open are bogus though these may be real life issues elsewhere in our society (attempts by the government to make companies build in backdoors or weaken encryption technologies). 
I can see why you would say what you did since we're on r/Bitcoin but I simply don't believe this article, or the case it discusses, has anything to do with Bitcoin. Control of money should be decentralized specifically because it should have nothing to do with our application of force and laws. Money is used in exchange and exchange is used in many decisions in our everyday life to express our needs and wants in the free market. It should be the choice of the masses as to how money should be distributed and not a central entity. This has more to do with our choices in how, with whom, and for what we do exchange being a form of freedom than anything to do with monopolies or competition. 
Again there is tie in to monopolies and competition when you consider the fallout and consequences of our current system of fiat and fiat controls. Banks have monopolies to access funds which can be seen as anti-competitive from the point of view of people who do not have this access and so on. The same for the fact that there are only dozens of people making some decisions, then hundreds or thousands effecting these, and then a trickle of these benefits out to everyone else. Horrible stuff. 
Also, a monopoly doesn't necessarily require a centralized entity and may, in rare cases, occur naturally. Although I would argue that many monopolies are due to government action this is not always the case. If say, I take control of the only source of water then I can make a nice profit selling access. You can argue that the people will go against me but what if my profits have reached the point where I have bought the police, the decentralized kind that works for private moneys. Well now it would be nice to have a central government where words, elections, and votes can force me into giving up my monopoly which I gained "naturally" over these water resources. Decentralization and competition are great until it comes to force where being bigger/faster/smarter suddenly means everyone else loses their rights to be anything but a slave.

Clearly not true for pre-iOS8.

So the feeling I got was that they don't want to do this because then the DoJ will go around unlocking all the phones. 
Instead they send out a tech who unlocks the phone and apparently, in some cases, this takes them minutes. Since they send a tech out I believe they really want to hide what it is they do, or what information they have, that allows them to unlock the phone. The DoJ also said they're willing to compensate said employees so I'm curious as to why Apple is suddenly not okay with this. I would love to speculate but I don't want to practice conspiracy theorizing. 
edit: in other cases it seems they mail the phone over, either way it seems Apple wants to make the final decision to unlock the device and only after their rules (particular phrasing in the warrant) are followed
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:54:52
edit: iOS8 devices on ALL hardware are immune to this, apparently
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:39:09
They cannot brute force it or they wouldn't need Apple. C'mon? NSA/FBI can brute force a device. Apple products have a safety feature that wipes them if you attempt brute force. 
Since they cannot be sure whether this feature is enabled or not they cannot attempt a brute force. 
The device also has a pending remote wipe request so turning it on will wipe it out unless Apple does their magic first. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:42:28
They can decrypt it and normally comply with these requests as the legal entities that make them comply with Apple's rules for making such requests. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:32:37
Umm, anyone can brute force a device with special equipment that can be built by any competent person. Brute forcing is the act of doing through all possible combinations.
In this particular case, as I stated, there may be brute forcing protections in place that iPhones come with can be enabled/disabled. However this protection does not prevent brute forcing it simply makes it ineffective by destroying the information the brute forcing is attempting to expose. 
If I'm wrong please clarify what you mean by 'cannot.'
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:08:53
Yes but that only solves that one problem and also comes at a cost to the people (whom, I myself find hard to believe sometimes, are represented by the DoJ). The brute force wiping the device is still an issue. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:36:09
Well this article, and I would think these comments, is about breaking into a cellphone owned by Jen Fung, some dude allegedly doing stuff with meth, so that's why we're discussing brute forcing a common cellphone and not hacking a knowledgeable person's crypto setup. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:06:51
Can you clarify what your statement means or is referring to?
I've been out of touch with Bitcoin news and this sounds important.
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:23:32
I don't know, Apple said it. 
My GUESS is that out of all the devices that can be upgraded to iOS8 some of them lack hardware encryption capability and are thus still hackable (by Apple) even after upgrade.
edit: I was wrong, 10% is non-iOS8
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:28:09
Oops, I tried to update all my posts as several other users pointed out my error. I found it hard to believe 90% of users were on iOS8 (Android user here) and misread the documents due to my expectations. 
iOS8 is fully immune as far as I know and that statement is supported by several other Redditors as well as the court document. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:12:46
This is a county judge, there is no judge lower than this unless non-criminal judges are somehow considered lower. Their ruling has little impact or meaning outside of their sphere of influence (exactly one county which contains the city of Miami and its surrounding area). Especially given that other (higher? maybe...) courts have ruled otherwise and legislators in other states have bothered to write laws suggesting otherwise. IANAL
Basically someone who has possible never heard of Bitcoin was given a case in which a professor presented an argument that was believed and thus the ruling. To reinforce that money laundering via Bitcoin is illegal in Miami the state attorney handling the case will no doubt appeal to a higher court which will likely find, as so many courts have found, that Bitcoin does represent "tangible wealth."
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:05:19
I cannot envision how such a force would operate without corruption simply due to it being bought out by the highest bidder (corporations). 
Do you have any ideas, research, thoughts?
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:43:26
Yet it manages to be very misleading with so few words. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:04:06
They should definitely appeal. The state of New York wrote financial legislation for Bitcoin. 
Rather arrogant of this judge, or perhaps she is ignorant of this, to not take that as a sign that Bitcoin represents "tangible wealth." I would be shocked if a higher court finds the same.
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:02:28
Just like this guy should have. He paid $3k to have a professor convince the judge it's not money. 
It paid off.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:29:30
I cannot determine whether this is a funny joke or a depressing reality.
@_date: 2015-10-24 01:39:58
iOS8 devices on newer hardware is immune to this. 
Apple has already solved the problem, but I'm sure they'd appreciate your suggestion. 
edit: woops, all iOS8 devices are immune to this, as other Redditors informed me I misread the documents
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:05:02
She said it's not "tangible wealth" which is a bit worse than not being money. She said it's worthless enough that you can't commit crime with it (money laundering).
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:21:32
He didn't hit anything on the head. He didn't describe a cryptocurrency in any implementation that Bitcoin users would deem acceptable. As a sattire it's a bit funny I guess, but technically he didn't even describe a system similar to Bitcoin so either he doesn't know how it functions or perhaps he is just trying to be funny.
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:25:07
There are out-of-court complaint handlers. I got this from 
I'm not sure if these are strictly regarding the transition to SEPA or the handling of SEPA... might be worth a shot. 
Servicio de reclamaciones del

La Comisión Nacional del

La Dirección General de Seguros

I don't know if any of those will be helpful but you may be able to get assistance from one of those organizations or else they might inform you that it's a banks discretion to allow transfers or not. Otherwise take note of the link Otohs posted, it shows Bankister as a bank in Spain that allows transfers to Bitstamp.

So I was going through your terms and found this: 
This site and the services we provide do not constitute a trading of, or an exchange in, securities, investment contracts or any document, instrument or writing commonly known as a "security", at law or otherwise; 
I'm shocked that this is your legal argument for the services you provide. In Texas the act of buying bitcoins and giving them to BS&amp;T (Trendon Shavers, Pirateat40) was considered an "investment contract." Granted, this is U.S. law versus Canadian so let's look into Canadian law.
I researched Canadian securities law, seems you guys have no federal regulator. Wow, I want to move to Canada suddenly, regional regulators seem like a great way to keep regulation at a productive level. Perhaps your argument that you are not trading securities can stand, I assume you've consulted lawyers regarding this. 
Something concerning, here's words straight from Ontario's Securities Commission:
“security” includes,
(b) any document constituting evidence of title to or interest in the capital, assets, property, profits, earnings or royalties of any person or company,
(g) any agreement providing that money received will be repaid or treated as a subscription to shares, stock, units or interests at the option of the recipient or of any person or company,
So umm... I'm curious as to who legally represents you guys because if you're not dealing in 'securities' then I'm not sure who is... honestly I would think the legal argument that the Bitcoin blockchain itself is a document showing title or interest in an asset is probably a strong one.
For a broad definition of document see: 
I think a digital record qualifies as a 'document' in a legal sense.
Again, I'm not a lawyer, have never studied law, and have never been in a Canadian courthouse... but to argue that you're not dealing in 'securities' when you're playing with money... I dunno... sounds like Mt. GOX's weak play on not being a 'money transmitter.'
Any way you guys can clarify what legal grounds your exchange is based on?
Sorry. 
EDIT: Fixed a typo, and I should add that I've considered moving to Canada before, have relatives there. Great place, nice education, good jobs, clean cities, at least from what I've seen. 
EDIT EDIT: Added an apology, seems appropriate.

Came here to link this, it was the third result on Google for the query 
"do spanish sepa banks have the right to refuse transfer"
I'd expect Bitstamp to make this information more readily available to their users.

You have no idea how a CD works.
Second Google result for "how do compact discs work." 
There is no way EMP will affect it. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:24:24
You know, I looked into other exchanges and this is a common argument (CampBX makes a similar claim). Bitcoin is "unregulated" in the sense that no one has declared it an asset that can be regulated as a security, which to me makes the BS&amp;T ruling a bit scary since they considered Bitcoin an asset... glad it wasn't a Federal ruling.
So, thanks for the gold! I might be trading with you guys soon =)

I'd be careful. This happened to me and Mt. GOX last year, months later they debited my account for the missing moneys and told me to immediately sell bitcoin to make up for what became a negative dollar balance. They were being stern but polite, I got the feeling they were concerned I had purposely stolen and such. 
The extra money was nice for a time... free loan.
