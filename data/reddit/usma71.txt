The tax consequences dictate about 33% markup, depending upon your tax bracket.  If you take money out of the IRA to buy BTC on an exchange, the taxes and penalties reduce the amount of BTC you can buy.  Furthermore, you are forgoing the tax deferral advantages of the IRA.  
By the way, Vanguard make the purchase of GBTC rather easy.  Don't be intimidated by the fact you have to call in for the first purchase. As I understand it, they require a verbal OK if it has been more than a year since any OTC purchase.  Not just for GBTC

Can buy on USAA brokerage.
Used to be able to buy on Vanguard but now they say no because it is a "foreign domiciled ETN."

Thought so, but still an interesting read.

Very well done.  Will bookmark it for newbies.

Seriously, we should encourage the tourists to transmit a bitcoin transaction from beyond the moons orbit.  That would truly be a milestone.

This is not news, but seems like a pretty significant development to me.

Sure, you can do that.  It seems there is little support here for your choice, probably because the alternatives offered are cheaper.  I have used an old ASUS just this way for cold storage and have felt it is quite secure.  I guess if you can get one for $100 or so it would be reasonable for you.  Just be sure it has a USB port so you can transfer signed transactions to your on-line computer.  I guess you could use floppy disks, but I haven't tried that myself.

There is something else going on.  I ran across this statement from BIT dated 4 October which correlates with the decline in premium. There are so many items included that I can't tell what is bringing the premium down.  Distribution of BCH to Gbtc holders is possible in this plan, but I don't see why that would bring down the premium.

bitcoin core version v0.12.1 (64 bit) works for me
Have you checkmarked that you are the wallet owner?

This is a very interesting idea and may prove to be important.
