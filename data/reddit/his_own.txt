Your first sentence doesn't apply to bitcoins it applies to everything. I'm faced with the possibility of communicating with someone who doesn't know who Bernie Madoff was. 
The second is just stunningly naive and hilarious. I am awe struck by the combination of petulant self-pitying and pride with which they were written. Yet even so, they pale in comparison to your reply which seems to equate social skills with intelligence and wealth and that in some way constitute a witty reply.
I think you need to stop blaming others for your losses, it's clear just from reading your replies you were simply never well-informed or adequately rational in the first place and should consider the entire experience an object lesson.

IMO this is not an interview you should have done. Trish does not seem to be a friend if the way she introduces you is as that guy "who got arrested for money laundering" as that immediately removes any credibility. Also the fact they had on file and immediately started posting shots of silk road was cheap and if it wasn't part of an effort to portray you negatively then I'd be surprised.
You tend to get very tense and high pitched when you get emotional and you kept using the phrase "brilliant technical thinker of our time". Combined with your general lack of structure in which you attacked Leah's points and the pace of your speaking voice the total package very much contributes to the idea of a bitcoin zealot.
Keep in mind I do not like Leah, I think she has done some very shoddy tabloid journalism and is essentially milking this for all the fame and publicity she can, however one thing you can say about the way she presents herself is that she is personable. She speaks clearly and calmly and all the passive aggressive "meanness" that seems to be a part of her personality is very well managed and unlikely to grate or even register to a casual observer. You on the other hand speak fast with poor pacing and tend to continue on with points that ramble on and ignores prompts and questions posed by the interviewer. These are all traits that will subconsciously put the average viewer against you and your message.
As stated before your tenancy to ramble also puts you at risk of saying exaggerated or inaccurate statements. The part where you claim Dorian can barely speak English is clearly false and borderline insensitive/racist to anyone who has ever seen a clip of the man further damaging your credibility. 
Judging from your other forum posts I hesitated to give you this critique at all as you seem to have poor abilities to handle criticism and seem somewhat aggressive and argumentative (although on the internet, maybe not so unexpected and did not see much of that in the interview itself), but seeing as how everyone else seemed to be giving you sycophantic answers and as you are at least notable enough to make public appearances and am essentially a part of "the face" of bitcoin, i felt it important that someone should give you a more constructive criticism than "you did great".
bitcointip pls.

I can't actually read what you're saying because RES blanks out your replies so I'm assuming its an apology on being pig headed and a new found appreciation for life.

Yeah the lack of preparation shows, quality of interview understandable in context.
I think you need to understand why the "barely speaks English" is important.
Dorian Satoshi is currently in the media spotlight. For the last 24 hours he is *the* story and what the masses know is that he is a possibly rich but otherwise grumpy old man who is apparently unemployed and has significant health and financial issues. He is being harangued by the media and has his life turned upside down. He loves trains.
He is a very sympathetic character at the moment. 
The first video anyone has ever seen of that man is him trying to leave his house surrounded by a throng of reporters. He seems very exasperated by all this. He makes a joke about "a free lunch" that makes not only himself but all the reporters around him laugh. This is not possible with someone who "barely knows English". Your comment, although in passing, is callous and off putting. It makes you seem like an indifferent person who doesn't really respect Dorian as a person which additionally contradicts the concern you express for his personal well being as a consequence of Leah's report. It makes you seem disingenuous on top of being a jerk.
Your first reaction to being told this by someone (albeit in an unnecessarily dogmatic fashion) is to have an argument with him which includes such debate choices as moving goal post and snide remarks about anti-semitism. This sort of falls outside of the critique of the actual interview, but I think is illustrative of how easy it is to lose credibility by making unnecessary offhand remarks.

the sidebar literally has links to anarcho-capitalism and libertarian subreddits. As for criminals, they aren't explicit members of any community but they're always around when new technologies offer ways to get around old regulations and no one can argue that silk road wasn't huge. criminal theory itself is rather "libertine"
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:18:47
I think you're giving Leah too much credit but yeah, it was a lose lose situation for her. The winning move was for her not to play. 
I'm actually shocked at how well she's manipulated the media frenzy for what I had assumed would have been a career ending move on her part.

These are perhaps two of the dumbest sentences I have ever seen uttered. Top ten at least.

don't you have anything better to do?
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:35:03
people keep misusing Occam's razor,
first of all, the idea is not meant to mean that the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is the **answer**,  but that it should be the one that's tested first. It's a principle of **economy**.
Second of all, this is **not** the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions nor are hypothesis with the fewest assumptions the ones that require the smallest leap. For instance a fundamentalist christian worldview only requires two assumptions "god did it" and "all contradictory evidence are a test of your faith". There are entire books written about the endless axioms on which all of math and science are based on.
Third of all, for some people it is *less* of a leap that an antagonistic and irresponsible journalist would skew information to sell papers by hounding an innocent man for months until she got the sound bites she needed from a person who is by all accounts anti-social and strange to say something that made it seem like he is the creator of bitcoin than it is for people to believe that the creator of bitcoin would go through painstaking lengths to hide his identity, then use his actual name as part of the project, all the while sitting on millions of dollars while he and his family suffers from financial difficulties.

I'm not disagreeing, but you're presenting two different ideas. I agree with the basic media training. I disagree with the idea of Leah setting Shrem up which was what I inferred from your original post.


I'd prefer not to engage in exaggerated statements while I'm in "non-troll mode", however, I have to admit the interview seemed ill-advised from my perspective.


Was more a commentary on my initial emotions and naivety. 


Hilarious. This is my guess too. 


Every word of that is true and I disagree with every word of it.
When I originally read the article I was filled with a sort of shock at how invasive and irresponsible the piece was. Leah essentially doxxed an individual and implied he had millions of dollars lying around. It's callous and irresponsible not to think that someone with the means but without the intelligence would consider that ample reason to put Dorian's life at risk, and all for the sake of literally moving some paper. Someone made the idiotic parallel to lottery winners. Hell, even lottery winners have the opportunity to prepare themselves before accepting their windfall. Depending on your state you can even retain your right to anonymity. 
For all we know Dorian doesn't even have that windfall, all the disadvantages with none of the advantages and all without consent or choice. I have no objective basis for the following indictment, but the entire media frenzy seems like a perverse interest in illicit cash, sort of like people digging around old people's property with the notion that gold is hidden somewhere on the land and I can't imagine someone would have spent as much time and effort into a piece without recognizing that fact.
The disconnect between my initial assessment and the reality is that everything Leah has done is actually perfectly legal and accepted standard practice. The fact that this is "nothing wrong" is what's I feel is actually wrong and is what should matter. This has nothing to do with BTC or its community, I actually don't have a significant stake in BTC and stay mostly for the fascinating social drama, it's just a personal realization I've come to about the media and journalism that I find disgusting and morally reprehensible. 
As a community, not a bitcoin community, I don't think a right and proper society should accept that as the way things ought to be.

Who compares bitcoins to the greatest inventions in history, puts birth control on that list, then tells people they have large sums of untraceable money with an account that I presume, contains their full legal name? 
This is the bitcoin community in a nutshell.

what's the 1%? Can you provide an example of something similar to bitcoin that remained stable and viable long after it's creation?

so essentially the same bad shit can happen but no big bad bank can rob you of it, unless 51% of the ~~bankers~~ miners agree on it.
So basically same world but a much more democratic form of tyranny.

ah yes, rational intelligent conversations always start with vitriolic condemnations.
You're an example of why the "sort of world [you think i] believe in" may actually exist.
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:23:37
if by hundreds, you mean like... a dozen (half of which are bitcoin derivatives) and by "only one that works" you mean "is popular" then yes.
but that's not what you said, you said that in the majority of the cases the recipe of a fixed supply currency without a real world asset to back it up fails, I'm looking for one counter example that isn't bitcoin because the jury is still out on bitcoin and it's pretty damning of a paradigm when it uses itself as it's own validation.
I'm asking because i'd really like to know, but it seems like you're providing conjecture not any evidence.

this author is basically saying, "bitcoin will either go bust or last a hundred years" and doing it in the most uneducated way possible.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:03:58
that's not really analogous. Paypal is essentially a financial services provider and has always been so, sort of like a visa and is essentially it's own bank. You can see it as an extension of the already existing infrastructure fitted for online financial transactions. 
If you think of bitcoin in the same way, there's no existing infrastructure that bitcoin is graphed into, unless you're thinking of the USD value it's pegged at, but then that negates the value of bitcoin as it's own currency. It's more of a speculative investment at this point.
