smooth and sexy! 
maybe BIP38 import/export support as a feature request?

heh heh, bang cock...

Ok his freaking name is Dr. Nefario!! You know they were just looking for an excuse to turn him away. If there's ever a problem down the line, no one wants to be the one to have to later stand up and say, "Yeah, that was me, I let in a guy named Dr. Nefario..."

I'm a bigger and bigger fan of the Kraken every day! Keep up the good work!

So, what we'd call, "3 nines?"
Not bad for an experimental decentralized system, but at the same time, room for improvement.

I believe the original definition of a Beta is that it is the first release intended for an audience outside of the team that developed it. This qualifies as a Beta release. 
Hell, I've seen what was alleged to be "Production-Ready Enterprise Grade" software that needed to be installed via git.

it may very well be true, and not be a good thing, simply because it might be the dollar that would be de-valued so much.

All market predictions based on past performance are complete bunk by definition. Past performance is not an indicator of future price.

You, too, can write your congressman. For free. 
One letter is often taken to represent thousands of people who feel the same as you, but didn't bother writing. 
Furthermore, the people actually reading your letters are often younger interns who are more likely to 'get' technology and Bitcoin, and then make a good recommendation to the actual Congressmen.
So five actual letters from actual constituents may have more of an impact that five hired lobbyists.
Write your Congressman right now:

So there are still ads, but now it costs me bitcoin to surf the web?

Don't forget the 15% for the IRS...

No, it means the miners are holding out for a better price! Which is not at all the same as non-miner investors actively purchasing...

Not that I know of. You'd have to use different software for that.

Me? None, thankfully. 
But Stripe is an MSB, they have legal requirements, if they collect money on my behalf, they have to "know  your customer", in the US, at least. I am wondering how their API meets that requirement...

Just curious, how hard is it to stamp titanium this way? Do you need power tools? I tried stamping steel once, and it's much harder to work than, say, brass...
Also, would you consider a smaller form factor? Credit-card sized?

What about LUKS? It's built into Ubuntu for much convenience, and it has already been audited.

I don't know why they exist, but there is a web browser automation tool called Selenium, you can get it as a Firefox plugin. You can script it to hit these sites all day long and make some coin. 
Edit: more verbose

The site has nothing! It's an email list to sign up for Beta, whatever that means. If it ain't up, it don't count! Sorry!

Those are quite serious accusations of the Fed stealing gold and all. Source?

Their basic premise seems to be that NSA would not run a non-US exit node. Why would anyone assume that?

since 1997. Not corporate-sponsored as such, but very different from the no-rules, no streets and no police presence days, I am sure!
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:23:55
yes they do, actually

I want to get paid in Bitcoin. 
I want everywhere I spend money to accept Bitcoin: rent/mortgage, grocery store, car maintenance, child care, medical care, ISP, utilities, gas stations, restaurants, computer hardware vendors, eBay, Amazon...
Bonus points for actually enumerating prices in Bitcoins, not just accepting them via an exchange rate!

Link to the official note? RT didn't cite a single source, and made a lot of accusations. Is there *any* info on this other than RT?

Public defenders for federal cases are actually usually top-notch lawyers, hard to beat at any price.

In reverse order: 
 Here's what I tell people: Bitcoin is just cash for the 21st century. We've taken everything computing technology had to offer at the time, and we re-designed money. That's all. No more having to trust a website to safeguard your credit card number when you buy something, no more wondering if your $100 bill is fake, no more Western Union to send money abroad, no more confusion with multiple foreign currencies. Just modernized money. 
 Just buy a little bit (0.05 BTC), and start using the software. You'll get it really fast. Remember the first time you used a web browser? I don't, either. It's just like that, it becomes second nature.
 Someone said that you can't out law Bitcoin anymore than you can outlaw algebra. It is a fact of math. I have faith that common sense will triumph, and it will be plain to see that you can't blame Bitcoin, any more than you can blame cash for all its illegal uses.
 Valid concern. You are gonna have to figure that one out. Learn about backups. Learn about encrypted backups. Plenty of free software exists to assist you. Also: online wallet services are an option.
 I use Coinbase. Now that I am verified, it is easy and instant. Couldn't be easier, in fact.
Hope that helps.  
EDIT: Added the mention of online wallets.

If you are discarding addresses you don't like, the remainder are not "completely random" anymore. But it turns out, that's not important: the address is a hash of your public key, your *private* key is in fact still completely random.
This is not the case for a brain wallet, the private key is constructed from a non-random value.

I am confused. I have always heard that the reporting requirement begins at $10,000, and your paper says so, as well. 
But IRS Form 8938 seems to say it's $50,000. Where does the $10,000 come from?
