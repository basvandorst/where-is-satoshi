@_date: 2014-04-06 10:56:00
This is how I've always looked at it. An example:
A friend of mine is a very picky eater, and usually prefers his food to be prepared in a very specific way. I don't mean he returns toast that's slightly too brown, but he is very clear when he places an order what he wants it to include or not include; it will never have pickles or onions anywhere near it, no lettuce or anything green, extra mayo or cheese on the side. When the food comes, he will usually return it if it's blatantly prepared in a way that he didn't request. If the server gets it right the first time, he often pays over 20% for a tip, requests that server in the future, and is inclined to return to that restaurant much more frequently.
Tips are an incentive for good service. For many people like myself who rarely have complicated orders or return food, it doesn't have as much utility, but I see why it exists. Many restaurants just do not have the management capability to carefully preen applicants for attentiveness and service ability, so in this way tipping also acts as a good filter for poor work.

@_date: 2014-04-06 15:27:27
I've never seen him not tip, it is just usually more if they get it right. And it makes sense to me, even if the server didn't arrange the plate, why would they serve him with an order they knew was incorrect?

Scammers who sell fake SEO services are an order of magnitude worse than anything Ross Ulbricht ever did. He was told a person was going to have him and tons of people using his site thrown in prison (or killed) and he fake hired a fake hitman to protect himself and others. Completely justified, unlike fraud.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:33:42
Oh, so because they don't market themselves that way they're not culpable. Glad you clarified.
Cool story, dude. Hopefully somebody doesn't kidnap or kill you for using the drugs you think people should be kidnapped or killed for selling to you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:11:18


They are, they just don't market it that way. Good observation.


They don't do shit to prevent it, the TSA does that. This is like claiming ISPs work to prevent the Silk Road from operating.


It's not a perfect analogy, but it's pretty silly to claim that Ross Ulbricht deserves to be in jail for life (twice) because some of the people who used his website are bad criminals. It's especially ridiculous when you consider the fact that they are operating on a black market created by an illegitimate government which profits from prohibition, and that prohibition itself is what attracts the violent criminals you're referencing to the drug trade.


Sorry, were you not financially supporting them when you huffed all those hard drugs into your system that you bragged about earlier? Or I guess those drugs were just given to you for free, and clearly you got them from friendly criminals who definitely didn't get them from cartels.


I know drug cartels exist. I never denied that. The violence of cartels, and others operating black markets, is an inherent economic problem caused by prohibition. Ulbricht profited from drug trade on his website, which is itself not violent. That there were some violent, cartel-connected criminals who used his website really has nothing to do with it, and definitely doesn't make Ulbricht ethically culpable. In fact, his website served as a relatively safe way to trade drugs, compared to buying from dealers in person. This is in contrast from how you brag about acquiring the drugs you use.
You've done an awful lot of projecting about the kind of person you believe I am and what my opinions are about the kind of people who trade drugs. Maybe consider for a moment that you're railing against a position that doesn't even really exist.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:26:42
You're being purposefully dishonest. Why? You know full well this is not "mean words said over the Internet." This entirely contrived scenario was one where a person was attempting to blackmail Ulbricht and send him and other users on his site to prison for life. Had it been real, it *absolutely* would have been self-defense.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:55:49
No, there isn't, that's the point.

@_date: 2017-05-23 16:54:30


Hahaha. You fucking moron. I know it wouldn't legally be treated as self defense. You don't need a law degree to know that. It doesn't change the fact that it would ethically be self defense, though.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:12:09




I don't use, buy, or sell drugs. I know you don't like that I disagreed with you on the Internet, but it's pretty funny to have someone claim I've ever in my life been mistaken for a cop, regardless of how "abrasive" you think I am.






Wrong. When you commit aggressive violence against people for otherwise peaceful activity (hint: even if it's activity engaged in by people who may or may not be criminals for other reasons) you are the one who deserves defensive violence.
I am not delusional, I'm consistent in my ethics. You are the one advocating violence be used against people for violating political edicts. Perhaps your brain has been fried from all of those hard drugs you claim to have done, which you'd prefer to see others kidnapped or killed for having sold them to you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:47:02
You believe people should have violence (being arrested and put in a rape cage against their will) used against them for trading in substances the government believes are too dangerous. Or facilitating that trade.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:17:39


In this fake scheme, which it is not disputed was concocted by the FBI, Ulbricht was convinced a person was attempting to blackmail him and others using his service. They were threatening to destroy his life, and have him indefinitely imprisoned, along with many others. Had this scenario been real, it would have been an act of self-defense.
There's a source. This isn't disputed. People claiming he hired a "hitman" are either misinformed, lying, or purposefully omitting factual details in order to make it appear to be something it's not.

@_date: 2017-05-23 03:41:19
Okay, if we're being pedantic and pretending "busted" doesn't imply caught and convicted, he didn't actually hire a hitman, he was told lies by investigators in a completely contrived scenario in which he and tons of the people who use his site were threatened with life imprisonment (or death) for nothing other than trading in black market goods. Even if any of that had really happened he would have been justified.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:56:59
You're (poorly) attempting to make a utilitarian argument to justify violence against peaceful people.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:32:00
Those fake people he supposedly contracted a hit on were undercover agents, and had it even happened it would have been justified, as they threatened to throw him and others in prison for life because they operated a website. Fuck you, and fuck anyone who condemns him for that.

@_date: 2017-05-23 04:35:57
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:53:42
You're right, he didn't know he was being set up. He honestly believed a person was going to destroy his life, and the lives of tons of otherwise innocent people.
The fake scenario was that he was being blackmailed and threatened by a person who could allegdly turn him in. Rather than risking that, he made the decision to hire someone to take care of the problem. Obviously he couldn't go to the police, that would cause the same thing he was trying to prevent.
Edit: for clarity's sake, his non-crimes were tantamount to running a black market website. Certainly a crime the US government would throw someone in prison for TWO fucking lifetimes for, but not a real crime with a victim.

By the way, the people Ulbricht allegedly hired to kill were not "rivals," they were threatening to blackmail him and other users on his site. Essentially they were going to destroy their lives for engaging in victimless "criminal" activity. Keep simplifying it, though. Clearly you're the expert.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:29:42
He would have been justified even if it happened, which is far from conclusive, and not even something he was charged with.

In the 100% contrived scenario, which nobody conclusively proved was Ulbricht to begin with, they were attempting to blackmail him (and others) for committing a victimless crime. Yeah, if you threaten to destroy me for engaging in otherwise peaceful activity, you better believe I would end you immediately and regret nothing.

Entrapment or not, the fake scenario was one where his life and tons of others were being threatened by someone attempting to blackmail him. If you were in that position, and it were actually true, you'd be fucking over countless other people using the website if you ran to Mexico.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:47:13
What argument? You just implied that Ulbricht should have gone to the police, who were setting him up, to defend himself from a person threatening to turn him into the police for a non crime. That is fucking retarded, and clearly so are you. ������
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:01:55
The answer is pretty clear to me, you kill the person who is threatening your life.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:23:47
Clearly you think it's okay to throw people in a rape cage for trading substances you don't approve of. I hope someone does the same to you for a victimless "crime."
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:14:36


A) Ulbricht was neither charged nor convicted of this
B) It wasn't conclusive that the person who approved of these murders was in fact Ulbricht (source: 
C) Even if he was that person, he did it because they were threatening to have him and his website users thrown in prison, probably for life. That's an act of aggression, and responding to it with violence is an act of defense.


I didn't say they were comparable, and how much money you did or didn't make from your involvement in the drug trade is pretty irrelevant.


Selling drugs is not unethical. In this context, only acts of aggressive violence are. Being "accountable for your actions" doesn't mean you have no right to defend yourself if someone is threatening to destroy your life because you chose to do something a group of politicians (themselves criminals) have forbidden.


Just because cartels exist does not mean Ulbricht was a party to their violence. This is why the airport analogy is relevant -- not because airlines are literally the same thing as Silk Road, but because any individual anonymously using a service may or may not be a violent criminal (or themselves connected to one) in the same way that a passenger aboard an airplane might be.
Your logic: Cartels are violent, therefor all drug dealers are violent, therefor Ulbricht is guilty and deserves life imprisonment.
Alternatively: Cartels are violent, therefor Ulbricht is not ethically entitled to defend himself if his life is threatened with permanent imprionment.
Just lol


I've constantly replied to what you've said. I think you really have fried your brain. Or maybe you are just so dense that you aren't capable of following your own positions to their logical conclusions? I'm not sure. It seems pretty clear you're cool with imprisoning people (an act of violence) for SELLING drugs, which is what I pointed out.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:42:27
If I'm engaging in peaceful activity and you threatened to have me and everyone I was trading with killed or thrown in a rape cage I would be more than justified in killing you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:57:55
Sorry, you're right. He was committing a "crime" in the same way people in the underground railroad committed crimes. I meant not a real crime, like one with a victim.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:38:20
I take it you believe people should be thrown in a rape cage (or killed if they resist) for smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol, too?
Oh, just ones politicians deem too dangerous?
Also, those two things are ethically similar in that neither of them (the trade of contraband and the illegal facilitation of escaping slaves) has an actual victim. Which was the basis I compared them. Great reading comprehension.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:06:46
Cool, better steal my money to give to pigs so they can throw them in the rape cage, cause that's clearly been helping the problem for decades.

I'm a US citizen. I created an account, but the only options to deposit to my account were through Visa, Mastercard, or bank transfer. Seeing no option to deposit with Bitcoin, I called their tech support, and they confirmed that US residents are not allowed to make payments with Bitcoin. I asked which countries were, and she said literally every other country. I told her that I had a house in Canada, so I would like to move my account to there. The rep said it was based on government ID number, or if you are in the US, social security number, so even US citizens with residences in other countries would not be able to transfer currency with Bitcoin. So, if you want to use this service and you are in the US, make sure to create an account that is based in another country.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:51:04
Not that he was convicted, but you're right: not only do we both know it, I would have done the same thing. And it would have been a completely justified act of self defense, not murder, as the person who he fake "put a hit on" was also a (fake) person threatening to throw him and tons of other people in a rape cage for engaging in free trade.
The entire thing was literally a contrived scenario, and even in the hypothetical he was in the right.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:30:20
Wrong. He was neither charged or convicted for this.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:11:05
I know it's hard for you to imagine, but not everyone bases their ethical stances on what a bunch of fairies in black dresses decree is the law of the land. I am not, nor have I ever been, under the impression that Ulbricht could have defended his alleged contracting of killers as legal self defense. I'm actually amazed that you think that, it really does imply that you're retarded.
"Ethical self defense" is a thing, it means an act of self defense that is ethically justified, regardless of how the state might view it. I believe Ulbricht would have been justified. Sorry you can't separate that view from the political edicts that constitute "the law."
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:24:36
Running an airport is unethical because the majority of the world's drug traffic is controlled by some of the most fucked up people that have ever existed in human history. You don't get to facilitate millions of dollars in international business for them and then claim innocence because you're 'just' providing the marketplace and not directly dealing with product, especially if you're raking in tens of millions in profit from it for yourself.

This guy said something I don't agree with, he should kill himself.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:29:59
Running a major drug market is not unethical. Being aware that it is illegal does not justify a person threatening to destroy your life in an attempted blackmail, which is what the contrived scenario was.
Ulbricht ran a website where others sold massive quantities of drugs. Regardless, even if he were selling drugs himself, it wouldn't justify violence being used against him. I absolutely would claim self-defense if someone attempted to have me kidnapped and thrown in a prison (or killed if I resist) for running a website where people committed victimless "crimes."
Just because some scumbag in a black dress said it's okay for police to enforce unethical laws does not make it okay for others to attempt to blackmail me. Both the police, and the fake blackmailer (who was in reality also an FBI agent) were in the wrong, and Ulbricht was in the right.

It's not very funny, rape is extremely common in prison, and a likely outcome for people you believe should be "punished" for trading in substances a group of fairies in black dresses have outlawed.
I believe people ruin lives by having them kidnapped or killed for engaging in otherwise peaceful activity should also be punished, preferably by public hanging. Governments are illegitimate, and so is the aggressive violence you advocate. Hopefully that level of violence isn't also used against you for the things you support.

On the contrary, everything I said was factual. You're the one living in a fantasy by trying to condemn a person for attempted "murder" when Ross Ulbricht not only did nothing wrong, but gave considerable thought to taking a person's life in self-defense: something which didn't even happen.
It would be one thing if you're trying to argue this from a pacifist angle, but you're not. You're just sitting there repeating that he's "just as bad" as some cartel lord. He's not, and you're full of shit.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:25:58
Even according to the FBI's version of events, which is both disputed and something Ulbricht wasn't even charged with, Ulbricht attempted to hire a "hitman," who was recommended to him, after an undercover agent told him another undercover agent was going to rat him and everyone else on the site out and get them all throw in prison for life or killed. This was an entirely contrived scenario made to get Ulbricht to incriminate himself, and it involved no less than his complete and utter ruin at the hands of an aggressor.
Even the fantasy version of events involves a person trying to destroy another and getting their comeuppance. He would have been totally justified. He is a martyr.
