What? The entire white paper describes two things - block chain technology, and bitcoin. Bitcoin is currency. Maybe you're talking about the usefulness of block chain in other places, but that's not the same thing. Bitcoin is a specific implementation and use case of the technology.
I don't see how you could argue that Bitcoin is not currency. It was specifically designed to be exactly that.

The nonstop attacks from both sides has shattered any confidence in either of these coins I ever had. It reeks of desperation and fear.

Regulation is performed by regulators, who are granted authority to do something when someone violates regulation. That's not what Coinbase is doing. They're trying to corner and manipulate the market, which is exactly what regulation is designed to prevent. Coinbase is doing exactly what we should expect with an unregulated product.

It seems like this goes hand in hand with a totally anonymous, unregulated currency.

It says in the title "electronic cash". What is cash if it isn't currency?

If it's reputation survives the fluctuation.

Bitcoin seems like a pretty good investment but a terrible currency. Its value fluctuates far too much and there's a limit to how much of it can ever exist. Combined with how easy it is to lose and how losing it would cause inflation like you've described, it seems like the smartest move is to never spend it, only sell it.

Right, I misspoke. Bitcoins may be infinitely divisible, but anything that rapidly increases in value makes for a bad currency since it disincentivizes actually spending it. Stability is incredibly important for a currency to be spent, otherwise it's an investment vehicle.

So is this. Tread carefully, this is leading to an equally dramatic crash soon.

Being a card carrying member of the kkk is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to racism. There are **far** more racists who express their racism through "states rights" and "law and order".
