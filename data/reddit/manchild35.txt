I was hooked on the internet for 3 years before giving up on it.  I came to the conclusion that it would never be anything but porn, ads and scams.

government using a mixing service would be pretty obvious.
I kind of believe the opposite.  I don't think the government deserves any financial privacy and in fact most of the world's problems come from the governments' excessive financial privacy. 
Mixing service not needed till you get to paychecks.

your post led me to 
What's going on here does the owner have ocd or something?

Hopefully it gets integrated with Siri to make for a truly useless payments solution.  But in all seriousness, 20% market share.  Has been just trying anything hoping something will work.

You should compare it to writing a check.  A few years ago my employer got a check for $20K from one of the largest businesses in the province.  He wrote my paycheck out of that and paid a bunch of other suppliers.
2 weeks later the company goes bankrupt so that check bounces.  That makes my check bounce (along with a bunch of others).  Not only did my paycheck bounce but then payments I had made bounced as well and were reversed (I even had the money to cover it in my saving account, but bankers don't care about that - each reversed payment made them $50 in penalties for me.)
The real beauty of all this is our bankruptcy laws.  A year later when it came time to split up what was left, votes were based on the amount of debt owed.  So a lot of the supplies that had been delivered could have been returned to substantially reduce the losses to small business, but the banks liquidated it and spread it out among themselves instead.
Sorry for the slightly off topic rant.  Confirmations don't matter for most POS transactions.  If you're ordering something online then the wait doesn't matter.

That's it I'm done with bitcoin. Apple pay allows me to pay for stuff electronically without breaking up transactions!
That's what plants crave!

You are using the wrong analogy.
The music industry killed Napster because there were people to go after.  The music industry hasn't had any success whatsoever killing bittorrent because nobody is in charge.
The transportation industry will probably kill Uber, but then a decentralized version will show up.

I was unaware that a member of a senate committee was actually the Parliament of Canada.  Thanks for clearing that up for me.

Yes. 2.9% fee.

That is a stretch.  Apple has 20% of the market, of that like 1% will care about apple's wallet, just like their last one.
Lawyers are in charge of apple now, innovation done.
Has apple done anything exciting since Jobs died?

You know, you could have made a fortune shorting bitcoin if you had felt like this last November.
Making money off bitcoin in 2014 is just as easy as in 2013 - if anything it's more of a sure thing.  Just bet on down instead of up.
Hopefully it is as easy to spot the reversal when it starts going up again.

Perhaps you never used siri? Apple maps?

Where is Dan Ariely through all this?  Am I the only one who has been waiting for him to mention bitcoin for years?
Not only would bitcoin be a perfect subject for  one of his experiments, but it would also make one hell of a tool for them as well.

Napster had a center to attack.
This comparison does not fit.
Decentralized uber will beat uber.

Do you own curtains? Blinds perhaps?  I wonder what you're trying to hide behind those curtains. 
All people with curtains are criminals. 
If you aren't a criminal then remove all curtains and blinds from your home.
