In the united states, you have three branches, each relying on checks and balances which have worked relatively well throughout the years. Both the legislative branch and executive branch are voted in by the people who will later be "controlled" by them via what is known as a representative democracy.
Therefore, the people who voted are both the master by extension and the ones controlled by legal reigns they themselves created.

I am mortified there are so many people out there like yourself who stick with the idea that just because a website has "done well" for years means it should not be updated. It's understandable if you are a company that doesn't touch technology and has no need for a website, like [BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY] ( but an ISP's page for customers?
An updated website would cost you maybe five grand at most, look much better than this, and make your company in general look much more professional.

For those unaware of P2P pool, here is quick rundown: 
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:02:23
Heck no, while the times when bitcoin is used correctly it is a godsend, you have to deal with people who have no clue how to use it.
~~For example, you always get this one fellow who manually typed in the address, made a typo, and sent the BTC to some other address. The person who paid is angry and now leaves you a 1 star rating or makes an angry post on a forum somewhere, along with you not getting any of the btc. Sure, it was clearly that person's fault, but now that BTC is for the most part lost forever.~~ 
Edit: Nevermind about then. Here is an issue I had personally that I know exists. Humble bundle processes payments using coinbase. They request a specific amount to be sent, for example 0.008048 BTC. I accidentally wrote it off by one digit, like 0.008049 instead. BTC was sent, but it was stuck at waiting for payment. I emailed humble bundle but they told me to email coinbase. While I did get it resolved, it took two emails and some time to fix, as well as time from the non customer side. For a few new customers, this would probably result in putting their arms in the air out of desperation and give up. Nowadays you can just click the link and have your bitcoin client pop up a payment request with all the information filled in for you, but those who don't have that set up this can be a real point of frustration.

That is already solved though, P2P pool is the solution to pool centralization. Why others don't use it, I haven't a clue. In the beginning it was a massive pain in the ass, true, but today? There are so many guides out there, just get a linux VM up and install it in there.
The [pro's]( far outweigh the cons, considering the only con seems to be roughly an hour of your time spent setting it up, most of which is just waiting for the blockchain to be synced. Hell, you can always just use someone elses p2p pool.

The reason why I and others happily use credit cards now, in the USA at least, is because the rewards are still worth it. Most stores do not lower the cost of the product you want to buy if you do not use a credit card and instead go with cash, so I would be paying the same amount regardless.
Then throw in that very few people take advantage of their credit cards, do the rewards I use are "subsidized" by the rest who don't just those rewards.
And lastly, I get to build credit history using the credit card, which will come in helpful when I am applying for any sort of loan or rent anything expensive.
Yeah, you can argue that I am paying higher initial prices because most stores use credit cards and build the merchant fee into their prices, but that makes a chicken and egg problem. I am not going to give up something which gives me cash back and rewards in favor for something which to me pretty much costs the same minus those rewards and cash back.

I also feel a big component is heavily leans towards more extreme ideals and very quickly dismisses, and if I may say so, arrogantly, less extreme ideas. For example, the times I hear terms like STATIST being thrown around is mind boggling, not to mention the often times ideas floating around here I would find on Users don't want to hear this, regardless if it is true or not, users are looking for a product which offers better services than what is currently available. They are not here for political ideals, hopes to over throw governments, destroy "banksters", or get rid of "theft via tax". They are here simply because it is better than another option.
I feel the extreme political ideologies floating around in here is extremely detrimental. I mean, look at [this] ( video of Amir on Russia Today. For petes sake, that was nothing short of embarrassing, regardless of your political leanings.

Check out the temperature drops and rises as you go through the day and night cycle.
20 F drop in temperature in just nine or so hours. These temperature drops are somewhat smoothed due to the ocean acting as a massive heat "sponge" on our planet, as well as landmass also retaining some heat. Plus we have an atmosphere that blocks/reflect a good portion of energy from the sun. Throw in cold/warm air moving around trying to keep equilibrium temperature wise.
The moon has none of those except land mass, so the temperature can easily rise and fall a ton more than here on Earth. Goes to show how hot the sun is and how much it impacts us day to day even though it is so far away.

And as always, I ask why the hell are the same people who praise bitcoin and other crypto's being decentralized using such pools? P2P pool exists, and it can't be used against a 51% attack, as well as being decentralized. There is NO reason to be using normal pools when you have p2p pool available.

I still don't get where is the "holy shit" reaction to decentralized securities like counter party and whatnot. For the first time in history, any entity, be it a mutual fund, index fund, some dudes business in his basement, a massive multi billion dollary company, anything, can request capital and then sell stocks and handle dividends for (mostly) free.
The craziest though is the black market applications for this. Let's use an extreme example. You are a company of hitmen/assasins, and you've got twenty such employees. You need a few million dollars for more training, weapons, and bribes. To put it simply, you want to expand, and you want to do it now. Previously, you would have to go through tons of mob bosses and crap to get capital at really unfair terms.
Now, they can list themselves on an exchange and request capital from anyone in the world. It is nearly impossible, if not fully impossible, to connect them to their listing, and people investing to their activity on the exchange. They can pass out dividends, do buyouts of other companies, whatever, fully anonymously with no legal issues.
**For the first time in history, any company, no matter how shady or massive, can put a listing on an global exchange and sell stock and handle dividends and whatnot. Imagine the non reversible implications of terrorist groups using this to their advantage.** This is in my opinion the most revolutionary aspect of efforts with bitcoin and decentralization, and I am flat out amazed this isn't being talked about or jumped on far more than it is now. Hell, this is actually scary!

Are you kidding me? We are talking about a USA FDIC insured bank. That's pretty much one of **the** safest placed to put money in the world. And in this day and age, really?
I am not saying banks are without their faults, they have issues. If you get yourself on a list somehow it's a huge pain to get yourself off it, but why would you end up on a list? Even felons who got caught dealing cocaine still have access to banks no problem. Yes, they are watched closer, but they can still use the banks.

That's a lot of zeros! The inverse of this is %10^-91, lets see the scale of this.
Assume that a year is %100, then the %10^-91 of that is 3.154×10^(-84) seconds, or way less than a plank time (really friggen small). 
What about this percentage of how long the universe existed so far? That would be 4.3×10^-74 seconds, so still pretty friggen small.
Ok, so what about the number of atoms in the universe? Surely it has to be at least 1! Turns out wolfram says it's 1×10^-11 atoms, damn.
Needless to say, this will probably be way less than a single human. So, what about 1 human on earth, how much is that in percentage of the world population? So we have 7.13 billion people out there right now roughly, 0.000000015% of that would be one person, or 99.999999985% of humanity.

One recommendation I have is that the cost per single wallet, in terms of distribution, is extremely high. For someone to take that wallet, he or she needs to take the entire page.
If I may recommend, print out paper wallets, fold them up into long but thin papers, and then tape them to the page. So if someone wants to take a wallet, they just take one wallet, leaving five behind for others and the paper staying up longer, resulting in a much higher impression count.

Well, that is what Kickstarter specifically says when you back a project. It is also in the FAQ I believe.
You are investing in an idea on Kickstarter with 0% return other than the object that the people will send you based on how much you spent. It is not a pre order service. Also, kickstarter says that the people doing the kickstarter are not legally required to deliver their product, but they must do all that they can to succeed. If they do not succeed, then I am extremely doubtful there is any legal basis for taking kickstarter to court.

I don't understand why people bother blurring such information. Why not just put a black box over the information in question? There is no way in hell you can "un box" your intended information in a picture because there is not enough data to do so.
Boxing something is also quicker and possible in much more software. Want to blur something? Open up gimp/photoshop/something.net, wait for it to load, put in the picture, blur, save. Want to box something? Open up paint, wait less than half a second, put in the picture, box, save. And as I said, boxing something is far safer than just blurring.

Well, the password cracker would have to assume a character limit on the password. The length would probably make it take a good while for the password to be guessed.
For anyone who wants to make a secure password that is not a massive jumble of characters, you have a few options. Think of a sentence, use the first and last character of each word, with a number between each word representing what word you are at, and a special character or two thrown in somewhere. The longer the better.
So, for example, here is a sentance. I friggen love Bitcoin and I want to be a millionaire!
That monstrosity will take according to that calculator at least 4 duovigintillion years!
Though, you can just do what I do and keep everything in a keepass directory using a keyfile hidden on a flash drive and a kick ass master password. The effort of getting through such a setup would probably cost more than could be stolen from me, so it wouldn't really be even worth a consideration, especially since there are so many others who you can get more out of for far less effort.

I honestly feel that the DDOS did have a part in the bitcoin crash. From what I understand, at first it was someone selling on mtgox a large sum, then bots came in causing slight lag. People noticed, and sold their bitcoins too, creating more lag. Bots react, more lag. This snowballed into the 60 minute lag, causing extreme panic and terror. Afterwards, DDOS's came in to attack other exchanges as well as Gox, not to mention most statistic sites also went down, resulting in a lack of information and awareness of what is going on.

Yep, and when you want/need a loan for whatever reason, such as a mortgage for your home you will get a horrific interest rate or no loan at all. Not to mention, using a credit card gives you the perks of a company, such as a virtually free with no questions asked loan for the duration of a month, and cash back bonuses which can reach over 2% for everything. 
Not to mention, you have the ability to do a charge back on anything you paid with your credit card, and most of the time the credit card company will go after the company in question using their team of lawyers. Such a perk would come in rather handy when dealing with assholes like ButterFlyLabs.

Well, you can sell bitcoins at the market rate or at a price you specify. Selling at the market rate can be known as selling right away, versus specifying your price is selling when someone is buying at or below your price.
So, lets say you want to sell some coins on Mt Gox at a price you want. You select "sell coins" and then make sure the "market order" is unchecked. You type in the quantity of bitcoins you want to sell and at what price you are selling them. Click sell bitcoins, and your order goes into a very large orderbook that mtgox maintains. Now your order sits in the order book until someone offers to buy bitcoins at a price that is equal to or a smidgen lower than your offering price.
The sell is final, you cannot reverse it. Once the bitcoins get transferred then you cannot do anything short of finding the guy you transacted with and beating him up until he sends your cash/bitcoins back manually.
This question is also relevant to how the stock market works. The only difference between Mtgox and a company like NASDAQ is that what you are exchanging is bitcoins instead of stocks, and MTgox sucks really hard and cannot handle even a few simple bots.

Credit/debit transaction fees are there to both support their very expensive networks as well as to make money. Visa for example is not a bank, it deals solely with the infrastructure to facilitate the transaction. The entity that issued you the card is a bank, but that bank does not set the % cut for each transaction, visa does that, the bank is there only for the line of credit portion.
But, I absolutely agree with your middle part. If you do not support them then simply do not use their service. Voting with your wallet is an extraordinarily powerful capability many do not realize. These companies are here to make money, if they begin to loose money, then my god they will move off their asses and do something about it.

Oh how so very much this.
The post implies that banks shut down the accounts specifically because it is for bitcoins. Most likely, they shut it down because they are not sure of the legality behind bitcoin, fears of money laundering, or think that the operation is a scam. Banks right now probably don't even care about bitcoin, its market cap is only 1 billion USD right now for petes sake. Banks handle trillions on a day by day basis.
Furthermore, this is extremism. Extremism is NEVER a good thing, ever. Religious extremism makes the religion look bad or evil. Scientific extremism causes the scientific community to look like cold evil brainiacs hell bent on progressing science with no moral qualms, making some people dislike science. Bitcoin extremism makes us all look like tinfoil people saying that the evil goverment is here to steal all our money through taxes, that banks are the worst things ever, and that we are all somehow utter slaves.
While some of the points being made may actually be interesting, though proviking, and merit of discussion, extremism such as this does not merit any conversation. This is just like some crazy guy on the train saying how you must repent because the end of the world is nigh and that your family will go to hell if otherwise. It turns so many people off, makes the person look like a fool, and causes anything else to come out of his mouth to be ignored, even if valid points may be presented later.
We do not need this with bitcoin. It would be such a shame if something as amazing as bitcoin turns into what the media often portray it as, some nerd tinfoil hat thing on the internet used just for drugs and money laundering. Please don't let this happen.

The price of the USB miners does not make them scammers. They do not say that you will even make a profit with them.

Though I do agree that you should not be buying a USB miner if you intend to make a profit.
You can buy a blade from many places, one of which is wtcr.ca
Though, they are not related to asicminer, any crap CS they have is due to wtcr, not asicminer, as the CS is being provided by wtcr.
AsicMiner is not a company who sells their product to individuals, they are meant to sell large orders to large customers, such as re sellers. Their customer service is designed according to that.

House pricing is dependent on many variables, for example crime rates might have dropped in the area, the house was repainted, a better real estate broker popped up, it is being sold in a different season, the people selling the house could have realized they had many takers so they rationally rose the price.
In the short term, it is in many countries best interest to keep USD stable, and these countries still believe it is stable, hell look at how cheaply american bonds are flying!

This is a perfect example of why something in its infancy does not represent the "finished" product, or the phrase "what doesn't kill you just makes you stronger". These possibly attacks are something like stress tests. The latest bitcoin bubble? It dropped to damn 58 dollars from 260 in a matter of hours! That could have easily killed the entire idea of bitcoin then and there, yet it survived. Not only did it survive, it is still gaining traction, and we are today back at 120!
These attacks can be a blessing in disguise for bitcoin. It causes these companies to improve their architecture further and further.

My god, do you know what I discovered today? There is a group in Mexico known as the Mexico drug cartel. They sometimes move over to the USA side during their operations and are known to be absolutely brutal with their very visible killings. The thing is though, that when they do get busted, they get busted with many kilo's of drugs stashed away in various places along with massive amounts of USD! 
USD is a currency currently backed only by the full faith of the US government, originally made by terrorists who attacked Britain and France. In a cash form it is for the most part untraceable unless you use "stained" bills. It is used for bombs, drugs, weapons, prostitution rings, and even as a cylinder to snort various drugs! I believe this currency should be made illegal due to its use for all these illicit currencies, this is a menace on society, a very dangerous thing, and a danger to our children, my god, think of the children!

That does create a very entertaining and fascinating mining world! If you think about it, we have something like that now even!
AsicMiner is currently not utilizing all of their production capabilities and instead selling their surplus. This is an effort to prevent hashing more than 30% of the network, so we already have a kind of unwritten agreement. It is also said that they have a good bit of miners ready to go so they can keep up with new hashing competitors very quickly to remain at around a 1/3rd of the network hashing power.

Can someone say how this being higher value would influence the value of BTC on other exchanges?
From what I see, this is for the most part an ETF with assets being held in the form of Bitcoins. If the ETF value rises to say $200 per BTC that is held in the asset, why would the remaining BTC increase in value? The bitcoins cannot leave that asset from what I understand. Is it just "they are valued higher there, so mine must also be valued higher!"?
Also, it only cost them $2,470.28 to do this filing! Holy hell that is cheap, I thought it would cost many hundreds of thousands of dollars!

Well, when I plug in my numbers for a 7950, which is 500 Mhash/s for SHA256 and 580 Khash/s for Scrypt, while still pulling 250 Watts and me paying for 10 cents per KwH, I get $2.09 for bitcoin mining and $2.39 for Litecoin mining.
But yes, it is not much more porfitable, only a little more, especially once you take into account the fees on an exchange to switch LTC to BTC.
Also, when you are talking about BTC+NMC+IXC+DVC, are you referring to merge mining? If so, I do not really understand merged mining, does this mean that while you are mining for BTC on your card, you are simultaneously mining all those alt-coins based on sha-256 at the same time? Is this done on the pool side, and if so, what pools exist that support merged mining? I sadly cannot find any merged pools.

I thought it would be best to have it optional. For example, a chrome plugin checks what your article viewing habits are for the past few months and predicts how much you will view for the next week. You set a maximum of a dollar for each week, so the plugin automatically allocates $1.00/num_articles per particle with a BTC address within a special div on the page. You can also set it to prefer articles from arstechnica and genesis block, giving them more.
Sure, you individually would give maybe 0.001 USD to that author for the week, but if you have a million people doing that? That is a full grand, and each person is paying you essentially nothing!

I do wonder though, if there is any way possible for a single human to make a country all by himself or herself. Under what grounds can a country colonize other land and proclaim it as their territory, while a single person cannot. Even better, how can one country split another country into more than one separate and new countries.
It appears that a country can only work if other countries accept it, but at what point does a piece of land change from being just a patch of land to the territory of a new country? How many other countries would need to recognize it for it to be "officially" a country? 1? 5? The UN? 50%? And even further, if another country wants to go to war with this "country", would it be called an official act of war, or something else?
Fascinating stuff.

You also have to take into account risk. The higher the risk results in requiring a higher return to make the risk worth it. I would consider these Shares very risky not because of ASICminer's behavior but because they are based on bitcoin, which can still implode for various reasons.

I am not so sure that the entire world is looking for an alternative to the USD or current forms of currency. I personally think bitcoin is an amazing thing, and I have high hopes in it for the future, but within reason. Will it replace our current currencies within the next ten or twenty years? No way. Thirty years? Doubt it. Fifty years? Ehhhh, maybe, but it will most likely be an updated, new, built from the ground up, crypto currency.
This is like those people that say 9/11 was an inside job. They may or may not have a point, but the second they go extreme, like Max or you, all interest in having an actual discussion go out the window because the level of discussion has descended into an immature back and forth drivel of words without much thinking or reason, and constant appeals to emotions or false arguments, such as a straw man argument. Another example are the republicans in the USA. A good percentage of them are very, very far on the right, and constant resort to very lame forms of argument. The actual republican ideology is a fascinating viewpoint, full of though provoking discussion, but the second they start to go extreme and use things such as straw man arguments, no one wants to seriously discuss their viewpoints with them. 
That is what I am going for regarding this article. Extremism, even if you are indeed fully right, will do no good. Instead, it will destroy the already fragile currency still in its infancy. If you want to see bitcoin succeed, you have to get as much people on board as possible, and using extremism is not the way, and will instead just push people away.
Also, I myself have not done anything great for bitcoin, neither have you, nor 99% of the people reading this post I am making. I had invested around $110 in it a few weeks ago, and talked about it with others, but that is all. What does that have to do with me discussion bitcoin "extremism" on a website designed solely for discussing topics?
I just realized that I probably responded to a troll, but ah well. This is a good wall of text, and maybe it will be of interest to others reading this in the future.

What is interesting is that this can actually happen in any sort of message technology.
For example, lets say that you use gtalk between two accounts. Instead of sending normal words and whatnot, you simply open an illegal file, such as CP, trade secrets, some FBI secrets or what ever, using a hex editor. Copy paste the hexadecimal into gtalk and send it to the other person. The other person gets the file contents without transmitting an actual file, just a separated stream of data. Here is the good part, your client keeps a log on your computer, the target keeps a log, and google keeps a log. How does google get out of this situation? From what I understand, they use a similar system to what sites like TPB use, the idea that since there is such a large volume of data, it would be financially impossible for them to look through it all. If requested, they have to remove it though, but if this is in the blockchain, you can't really remove it I guess.
So, what other communication gets logged automatically but can't really remove the logged files without serious problems? I can't think of anything really. Maybe if you do stock trading, and trade using the first letter of each company as a base 26 character. Trade companies stocks using the first letters at a certain time or something, this gets sent to the exchange, in this case, NASDAQ. There is no way in hell NASDAQ will modify their transaction information without some serious problems, at least I don't think so.

All major banks do NOT have such terms. Chase for example does not have such terms, Amex does not have such terms, Schwab does not have such terms, and Ally does not have such terms.
You knew fully well that you will be charged a fee for not using your debit card at least ten times a month. It is clearly displayed when you signed up as per the law requires them too. So it is either you were not aware, or you knowingly did not use the card expecting the fees.
This is similar to people who get balloon mortgages and cry their eyes out when the payments rise as outlined in the agreement. That huge paper they give you is something you are agreeing to, and there are some important stuff in there, such as minimum use fees. Not to mention, a very quick google would have given you this information.
If you do not like this bank, you can freely move to plenty of other banks, some of which I listed above. This is where market competition actually works, if you wish, you can very easily move to another bank with lower fees. The best part? Based on fractional reserve banking, your (guess) 5,000 deposit is responsible for 50,000 worth of credit the bank just lost, so you lost them nearly 50,000 worth of potential profitable credit.

I feel that in todays world, "Protect the children" is being less and instead Terrorism is taking its place. The only way you can push bitcoin towards a protect the children idea would be to say that it somehow encourages sex trafficking. Not to mention, most people can clearly understand how something may or may not protect the children, but terrorism gets a bit more iffy.
For example, the obvious terrorism side would be buying and selling weapons or explosives. But that is not really happening much on bitcoin. But there are more hidden methods of financing terrorism, such as drug trafficking, loans to questionable groups, laundering money, moving money, or even renting out military services, all of which is not as visible due to it being better hidden and less obvious to the viewer. 
Terrorist attacks impact everyone, not just children, and are extremely publicized, while a unfortunate situation with children is less publicized, or the public just leaves it as a talking point for a few days. A terrorist attack stays in the minds of millions for years. So, the public would be more accepting of a "this is bad!" for terrorism instead of protect the children these days.
I am not saying that bitcoin does or doesn't do this, just wanted to present my feelings towards the choice of wrapping paper. Also, I extremely rarely see any actual discussion going on in this subreddit, only one or two sentence responses. Where's the discussion guys?

SSD's are now approaching the maximum speeds of sata6, and you can find most SSD's at 500 MB/s for read and a smidgen lower for write. Latency is far lower than on harddrives as well, so random reads, which the blockchain appears to be full of, is going to be much faster on an SSD than a HDD.

While yes, this is new, keep in mind that a different fund, called ultimafund, happened a few months ago, which has been preforming abysmally. (Based on the USD to JPY)
Now, in regards to this, here is the key thing:


This is meant for people with plenty of spare cash willing to take an extremely, in relative terms, risky investment decision. And even better, where the heck do they have their prospectus, they have no past performance, hell, they even don't say specifically what they assets/holdings are.

No, depending on your country, the money in your bank account under a certain sum is insured by someone. In the USA's case, it is the FDIC insuring all deposits under I believe 100,000 USD. Not to mention the very act of insuring the money decreases the likely hood of a bank run due to people feeling their money is safe, in turn making it even more safe.
Treasuries have negative interest rates because investors are not willing to have more than 100,000 USD in one bank, so they either split it among other banks, which takes time and the weak link is still the FDIC, or just put it in treasuries which are backed by the USA instead of just the FDIC.
Also, it makes no sense for a bank to exist that is not fractional reserve banking, unless you are willing to pay the bank to hold your money. How else would the bank make any money what so ever?
@_date: 2013-07-09 07:56:55
Yes, but they will never make a full ROI in terms of BTC. You are guaranteed to loose money this way versus just buying BTC and holding.
If you pay 2 BTC for this, then you will never make 2 BTC back, ever, assuming bitcoin diff does not fall. It would be much better to simply buy 2 BTC and hold them.

They are actually working with opencores.org who I trust and actually use every now and then. Opencores is a website that you can kind of think of as github but for chip components. As you are probably faimilar, there are programming languages for different tasks, such as HTML and CSS for visual web design and C++ for actual programs. Chips use a different type of language known as an HDL, or a Hardware Description Language. There are two main HDL's, Verilog and VHDL, both of which in short describe the chip's hardware from a gate level all the way up to logic shifters.
OpenCores contains different chip components on their site in the form of Verilog or VHDL. The reason why I trust OpenCores is because they have been designing a processor from scratch known as the OpenRISC, which has been tried and tested over the past few years in FPGA's and academic settings. FPGA's are for these purposes much slower and more expensive version of ASIC's but they are reconfigurable. And we are not talking about some little 8 bit core like on the two dollar PIC12's from microchip, we are talking a full fledged 32 bit core capable of running the Linux kernel. KNCMiner said that they will be using the OpenRISC for their chips.
OpenCores is well known in the EE and chip design as well as FPGA world and have been for many years. When you add in their work towards the OpenRISC processor I can safely say that anything they vet can be considered to be true and lacking any FUD. What I mean by vet is that opencores have put on their newsletter a few weeks ago about KNCMiner using their "partner" ASIC design company known as ORSoC to assist in the design of the ASIC Miner, and how they even have an FPGA prototype already running. [Here is the newsletter]( 
Based on how OpenCores itself is very trust worthy, their partner ASIC design company also being very trust worthy, and how OpenCores said that an FPGA prototype is already running, I would say that it is very believe that KNCMiner have indeed plans to get their ASIC Miner up and running within the next few months. So the question is not really if KNCMiner can make a chip according to their specs, but if KNCMiner itself is just a scam (take BTC, make miners, keep miners), and if they have enough capital for designing it. In all honesty, based on how their interactions with the previous entities I mentioned are publicized, I would believe KNCMiner is genuinely working on producing this miner and not a scam, but what my personal reason for possible concern would be like I mentioned above, do they have enough money to design a chip using such a feature size (28nm is very damn expensive). Since we do not know much if anything about the company itself, I cannot really say if they do have enough money, but based on how much venture capital is going around I wouldn't be that surprised if they really did have the few million for doing this.
So yeah, based on how entities such as OpenCores and ORSoC are communicating with KNCMiner, I can safely say that KNCMiner does intend to make due on their promise. My one worry is do they really have enough money to design and produce these miner chips using a 28nm feature size. If they were selling a cheaper slower unit ( $500 or $750) I would buy one without much stress, but for 3 and a half grand that for my financial capabilities seems somewhat too risky.

If you want bitcoin to thrive, you need those average joes. Bitcoin needs capital, so where are you going to get it from? Either from rich people, in which case you will have a majority of bitcoins in only a few hands, or from the masses. There are so little people who are familiar with technology yet never heard of bitcoins that we now need to move towards the remainder of people.

Avalon is giving a proper update, future development information, allowing for refunds before the start shipping, actual pictures, and we have reason to trust them regarding this due to their performance with Batch 1.

In this situation, it is for the design size, or unique wafer area, so number 1, or  9 mm² * €18k.
In situations where you are mass producing them, I believe the pricing is done based on the NRE first, like the cost of the masks as well as equipment setup costs, and then a truly minuscule cost per ic assuming the yield is good. So you tell them the feature size, type of process (mems, Intels fin, exotic materials), the design size, and them amount of die's you need. The die size is still taken into account, but it does not play as much of a role in how much mass producing them costs compared to this group buy service.
So, number one, which means your design would only cost 9 * €18k, or €162,000, or $215,000 USD. Pretty cheap considering you are using a very close feature size as the big guns like AMD and Intel.

To all the people here who are acting like ten year olds telling him or her to send BTC to your wallet, what the hell is wrong with you? You people are early adopters of possibly the newest and biggest thing since the internet, and this is how you behave? I see better behavior from ten year olds trying to help each other.
Now, 40,000 is not that much believe it or not. That is just one years worth of salary in a meh job. People loose their entire homes but they get back up and learn from their mistakes. One of the most important investment information is never, EVER, invest with money you cannot afford to loose. Also, it is never a good idea to go all in on a very speculative, volatile, and new investment. While yes, if you win you can have enough to retire, loosing is also quite possible and loosing means loosing that money.
Do not hurt yourself over such a measly sum of money. You can take a loan out from the bank for 40,000 somewhat easily, especially if you were able to have 40k sitting around able to invest. That should be enough to get your on your feet in the meantime while you work things out. You can repay that loan over the duration of even ten years if not more. You can ask your family for financial assistance. 
Also, if you are looking closely, it appears that bitcoin is starting to go back up little by little right now. This DDOS stuff happens every now and then while the exchanges are still so little and young. For all you know, it will rebound to $300 over night. Do not do anything in a panic, this goes both for trading and for normal actions. Think about what is going on and try to consider the alternatives. Do something now with a guaranteed loss (your life), hold and see how it goes (possible improvement if not actually earning more), or sell some you have now to recoup your losses and leave some in for possible future growth. A guaranteed loss is much worse than a possible rise or possible further loss. Do not give up, and talk to us here. There are people here who do actually care, not all of us are like the 16 year olds you see who are playing with their parents money.

Absolutely. I proclaim that June 14th is hak8or day! On June 14th it is hak8or day, so I will celebrate it. In my frame of reference, it is a holiday, but the issue is that it is celebrated only by myself and no one else, so it is a very unpopular holiday. 
Going further, the USA has July 4th as independance day. Of course, not everyone celebrates the 4th of July (the rest of the world), so is it any less independance day just because only the USA celebrates it? In the USA's frame of reference, it is Independance day, but from the frame of reference of everyone else, it is just a normal day.
And then you have something like Pi day, which is celebrated all over the planet from all possible references, unless you live in an alternate reality where Pi is actually 3.13 or something. It is a holiday that exists from all frames of reference. So, should we only accept holidays that exist in all places on the planet, like Pi day, or should we allow maneuverability so that individual entities can make up whatever holidays they wish? But, the key thing is that for a holiday to be "successful", you need a good group of people to partake in it, or else, it is just another hak8or day.

Sounds like it could work, and loosing ten percent is not catastrophic or anything like that, so that could be a good way to handle a portfolio. For me, I am treating bitcoin itself to be very risky, with companies being even more risky due to the lack of any regulation (AMC's IPO share price manipulation for example). Me being on the extremely risky side, I have roughly 75% of my crypto in AsicMiner, maybe 10% in AMC, 10% in my wallet, and the remaining 5% thrown at alt's like LTC.
Anyways, you can spot options which are available on asicminer by going to the asset and clicking on options, which displays all available options.

[I study a theory called N=4 super Yang-Mills...](
 I don't see any mainstream news covering material like this with anything even close to the details ars gives. Though, it is wrong to even compare them like you are, both are for very difference audiences, with ars being for people who love anything STEM and want details often resulting in a wiki spree, while NY Times is for the average joe who has to be able and get as much information as possible while drinking coffee in the morning.

And an even shorter TLDR!
Making your components run faster, known as overclocking, makes lots of heat. At extreme levels of overclocking, you need Liquid Nitrogen to keep things cool and stable. Overclocking does not have that much of an effect on mining. Bitcoin mines with SHA-256, which ASIC's have been designed for, taking away their profit, resulting in GPU miners possibly moving to Litecoin which uses Scrypt. Don't but a dedicated mining machine right now because to break even it will take a very long time.

Heh. I can only remember how often I have read about students doing their ASIC project when in university only to realize that it does not work. At least students are using their own universities fabs!
I was using such small amounts of chips since I was using the cheapest pricing for the group ASIC orders. If you were to do this ASIC business for real, you would probably be in contact with a company like TSMC or ST or someone like that and would indeed be getting at least a wafer worth of them. Any less and the people working at those companies would look at you with a tilted head going "What?" when you tell them you want less. Though, like I said, I am not familiar with pricing for full blown fabs and instead only with small group orders.
Though, I assume like you said, you already paid for the masks and everything, might as well just get a wafer worth at least.
For anyone reading this and not keeping up, here is a super quick rundown of IC fabrication. You have your base material, known as a wafer. Wafers are just disks of silicon with some other stuff on it, and you "put" your transistors on it. The way that transistors are put on it is done using what is known as masks, which are just plates of quartz and other materials that create a "window", so that parts of the mask are see through while others aren't. These masks are very very expensive, and I believe to be the most expensive part of the manufacturing of ASIC's. A mask for a 28nm ASIC costs a few million at least. And you have many layers on an IC, from six all the way to I believe 28, depending on the IC complexity, and each each layer has its own mask. So the costs run up very quickly. 
When you mass produce ASIC's, you reuse those masks. Those wafers are very cheap compared to the masks. So the difference financially between making one wafer and two wafers is much much smaller than making no chips and 1 wafer of chips. Each wafer can hold a few hundred if not thousand of the die's, which are the main component of an ASIC or chip, depending on how large each die is.
The reason that I earlier used runs of 25 die's is since I was using pricing information that is avalible to the public. That service works based on buying space in an order, and spreads out the NRE among all the orders in the group you are ordering with. It is very similar to OSHpark or BatchPCB.

I am not sure if you intended to respond to me or to someone else. It seems to not be relevant to what I said, hence my confusion.
Regardless, you can still do transactions without paying a fee. Some clients require some sort of transaction fee, some allow you to change the fee. Some exchanges take a fee for themselves. If you do not pay a fee, then in the future it might be possible, I think, that miners will simply refuse to handle your transaction, meaning a miner will have to exist that accepts handling transactions for free. Right now, this is not a problem, but might be in the future. Again, I am not sure if I am understanding how transaction fees work correctly.

Yes, if bitcoin becomes a major currency there will still be mutual funds and stocks and whatnot, but what concerns me is that during the transition phase the people who don't immediately sell their USD denominated assets and replace them with BTC denominated assets will likely loose everything.

The difficulty change shouldn't be just 30% per month, especially since Avalon will send out their asic's soon at which point it will sky rocket.
Also, you really shouldn't count your profit in terms of USD. You are buying mining rigs in BTC generating BTC. The reason for doing it in BTC is so you can see what is more profitable, either just buying BTC and holding, or buying BTC and exchanging it for a mining rig and then mining the BTC in return.
The calculator you used is in USD instead of BTC, hence you not spotting this. 
I use a difference calculator, conish.
Here is my setup using 38% increase per month, which is based on the dif increases over the past (I think) week.
Looking at the reduction, look at "considering reduction" and see how it says never. That means that if you get the miner today and pay 1 BTC for it, you will never get back your BTC cost.
Now, this is assuming you are buying the miners to mine. The miners deprecate in value over time, though right now they have high resell value on ebay for USD, so if you are buying them for resale then by all means.

Exactly, the main part is that you had your best intentions in mind. You were not doing this as an addiction, you were not doing this to pay coke or weed. You were doing this in an effort to help your family. Currently, it is not working out in your favor, but at least you still have your home, car, and family. There are people who took out loans to buy into bitcoin, and they are in an extremely rough patch right now. You luckily did not do that.
Also, like others have said, once you sell you realize your losses. Since it fell so far so fast, it is safe to assume that you lost an extremely large portion of your savings, so if you loose the rest it won't be as catastrophic. Instead, if you keep holding on, you might break even in a few days, weeks, or months. 
Keep strong, tell her that it was not too bright to use all your life savings, make her some breakfast in bread with some nice tea, vacuum your home before she gets home, do some cleaning for her.

We couldn't have hoped for a better person to represent bitcoin on the large news networks. He clearly understands bitcoin, he is able to do very well with the limited amount of time he is given, and he is very rational. Imagine if we got some nut that we see often on or the BTC-E troll box yelling that it is to get rid of evil banks and end of government currency and all the other extreme sides of bitcoin.
We should put his face on a bitcoin "bill" or something just for the hell of it. Or a paper wallet for bitcoin.

Just wanted to say thank you for making such an awesome chart! It is really awesome that I even get to have the guy or gal who made this read my post and even be a redditor!
I shall be very excitingly waiting for it to get onto github! I originally wanted to do this as an educational experience (studying CS right now), but seeing as how you will put this on github I will just see what I could do with it afterwards, like adding in litecoin. I won't be presenting it as my own work or anything of the sort though, and it would still have full accreditation to you.
Luckily I am somewhat familiar with everything you mentioned, and I am always up for a challenge! It would be pretty cool to run this locally and have it update in near real time on a large 1080p tv. Maybe even some background fading or something to make it look more "animated" while not remaining distracting.
Again, thank you for such a kick ass chart and possibly putting it on github! I hope that working on this gives you great satisfaction and joy!

To be more specific, Bitcoin and most other coins are based on SHA-256, which is used for bank encryption and whatnot. The "unusual" coins like Litecoin use Scrypt which is a relatively new algorithm. The difference is that there are currently no ASIC's for Scrypt, so Scrypt based coins are currently being mined for the most part only on GPU's, with botnets using CPU's, and very few using FPGA's.
One of the main differences with Scrypt is that it is much more intensive than SHA-256. For example, a 7950 gives you ~500 Mhash/s for SHA-256 while only ~600 Khash/s for Scrypt. Also, Scrypt requires a good bit more memory than SHA-256, which means that ASIC's wouldn't be really limited on pure speed, but also the amount of memory they can hold. For SHA-256 you only need trivial amounts of memory compared to Scrypt, and for chips (ASIC's) the cost is mostly based on feature size and the amount of space each die (the actual chip itself) is.
A very meh assumption which I would consider alright to use in this case is that for performance, logic based components of the chip (AND and XOR gates for example, as well as shifters) give you much more performance per every square millimeter than memory per square millimeter. And since you need a good portion of the chip area for memory, you're performance won't be that stellar based on how large the die is.
This creates a situation where making an ASIC for mining Scrypt based coins requires a large die if you want it to be better than using current GPU's. A large die means expensive, much more expensive. Since the actual prices are under NDA and we cannot access them, to get a very general idea for chips in very small quantities (less than 25), lets say that we have a design that is 15 square mm using a 130 nm feature size (AsicMiner is 130nm and Avalon is 110 nm). Lets use the cheapest 130 nm CMOS process from ST, which is the "130nm CMOS HCMOS9GP" and costs 2,200 Euro per square mm. 15 * 2,200 Euro = 33,000 euro, or ~45,000 USD
Now, this is for a very small run of 25 of ic's. If we want more, the price DRASTICALLY falls per ic. This is due to what is known as a very high NRE, or Non-recurring engineering costs, which simply means that it costs a huge amount of money for the company to set up their machines and assembly line to start producing your chips.
Of course, this does not include costs for actually designing the thing, and it is very likely that the first chips will have a mistake somewhere and won't actually work like you want them to, especially if this is one of your first forays into ASIC's. Expect hiring someone to design the chip to cost at least 75,000 USD, and the design software itself to also cost 50,000 USD. And this is not including the costs for prototype PCB's, costs for simulating and verifying your design on a very fast compute or cluster (Amazon EC2 for example), and paying someone to handle the logistics behind all of this. The costs really fly high when you start to look into it, but you have to keep in mind that the payoff is also quite good if you do succeed. All in all, I would throw a wild number out of my ass to satisfy the "so around how much would it cost?" and say that the costs for designing the first working ASIC to be at least $225,000 USD, and ramping up production to start mass producing them would have an NRE of $25,000 USD. This also does not include legal fees, but I haven't got the faintest clue regarding prices for that so I left it out, for all I know it could be just an extra 2 grand or 30 grand, I haven't got a clue.
Here is a good run down of ASIC costs:
Edit: Feature size for Avalon fixed.
Edit: Feature size for AsicMiner fixed

Here is my email for the people who are too tired/lazy or unable to think of something cool to write:
Hello Western Union,
I have  read on foxbusiness.com an article that you are considering using Bitcoin in your future business ventures. I am very glad that you are pushing yourselves into the future by possibly embracing such a revolutionary form of currency. While I am probably one of the very few of your customers who have heard of Bitcoin, much less even use it on a day to day basis, I can safely say that by you possibly utilizing Bitcoins speedy and extremely cheap transactions, you will enter a market that is currently extremely lacking very easy and efficient means of entry in the form of changing fiat currency such as a USD into BTC.
If Western Union adopted this, you guys would be the only point of exchange that is secure, well trusted, and extremely easy. The current forms of obtaining Bitcoin are by either physically going to a very small amount of Banks and depositing into a bank account, doing a costly bank transfer, doing a in person exchange, and a banking account transfer. None of these are both timely, easy, and safe, which Western Union could solve.
Bitcoin has just surpassed a $1,000,000,000 USD market cap, with more business offering to do their payments in Bitcoin every day. Bitcoin is a technology in its infancy which is growing all the time and constantly finding more eager customers interested in utilizing it for their financial needs, and I hope that Western Union may be a part of this new, extremely fast growing, and revolutionary idea.
After all, I am sure that Western Union wouldn't want to pull another patent goof like it did many years ago when Bell offered to sell Western Union the patent for a measly $100,000 but Western Union refused, saying
"Technically, we do not see that this device will be ever capable of sending recognizable speech over a distance of several miles."
and later
"In view of these facts, we feel that Mr. G.G. Hubbard’s request for $100,000 of the sale of this patent is utterly unreasonable, since this device is inherently of no use to us. We do not recommend its purchase". 
From an enthusiastic Bitcoin user wishing you a pleasent day,

@_date: 2013-07-05 03:45:22
I won't comment on what the idea behind mining actually was or anything like that, but instead comment on the more immediate concerns.
The hash rate has increased drastically due to ASIC's, and is reaching a point that if a government wanted to take it down via 51% attack it would cost them a very large amount of money in the form of fabricating ASIC's themselves under the assumption that mining companies won't sell to the goverment.
Secondly, the money flowing through the bitcoin economy due to these ASIC companies is staggering. A company like AsicMiner is exchanging those BTC into USD to pay fabs and for equipment, and the people buying those ASIC miners are buying BTC with their own currencies (USD, CHN, etc). We are getting more move moving in the economy, which is a very good thing.
These companies also generate interest in the form of investors, and they almost single-handidly created the idea of asset exchanges that operate using only BTC. Due to this, you can now list your company on bitfunder or BTCT or havlock or picostocks, most of which are very sturdy in the form of protected from DDOS using cloudflare, can seemingly handle large and quick orders without horrific lag, and are continued to be developed like bitfunder starting to use 2 factor authentication. Investors have a good place for where to buy and sell these assets with relatively good liquidity, and such gains for such a large company are bringing in other investors who did not wish to invest solely in BTC.
Lastly, if you wish the algo, you would wipe out all the previous miners. Companies like AsicMiner, Nastymining, AMC(?), Avalon, and BFL would probably crash and never recover. Why would anyone else want to invest tens of millions of dollars or more to develop ASIC's with the risk that the algo would be swapped in the near future rendering all their R&amp;D useless? We would be stuck with just GPU's, CPU's, and FPGA's, decreasing network hash rate and therefore deceasing the security of the network from a 51% attack. Those companies that are providing a large component of the BTC economy would be gone, and with likely no other companies on such a scale appearing for a long time the economy would have less money flowing, which would be a bad thing.
Also, how about just generating a new coin instead of changing the BTC algo with everything else being the same? If the majority agree with your idea for replacing the algo, they will move to the other coin and use it, if not then BTC would continue to be used. Such a change forces the bitcoin population to change against their will, which is against many of BTC's democratic(?) ideas.
All in all, I feel changing the algo is a terrible idea, go start your own BTC clone with a different algo if you want instead. It would wipe out massive investments and companies driving the BTC economy, which would likely cause BTC to drop like a rock in value, something I am sure most if not all of us do not want to see.

I second a few comments on companies who are on exchanges like havelock which release "shares" of the company. Asicminer is the main one, they design and release mining chips. ActiveMining is another one but has yet to release hardware. Both have dividends. Due to the recent shutdown of the bitfunder exchange, they are both working on colored chain exchanges, meaning instead of shares of a company being managed by a central authority, they are distributed similar to bitcoin.
Both are relatively tight lipped about it, but activemining said we are a few weeks away. It raises an interesting situation since if this goes well it means people will be able to hold shares in any company in the world, though it also results in the risk of illegal companies for some really shady things also being able to get in on going public and whatnot.
Keep in mind that due to the bitfunder shutdown, both companies have a massive majority of their shares direct, meaning they are not on these exchanges so the order book is minuscule.

Alrighty, good good.
I think it is also good to say for people who are actually at least somewhat curious, that you can always buy part of a BTC without any problems, just like how you can exchange a tiny sum of 35 cents into 26.89 euro cents.
The best visualiztion of this I can come up with is:
single BTC -&gt; single American Dollar
1,000,000 Satoshi -&gt; 100 American cent
But that might confuse people into thinking that a BTC is worth a dollar, so possibly "Just as an American dollar has 100 cents, a Bitcoin has 1,000,000 Satoshi, so just as you can exchange cents to foreign currency in their cent form, you can exchange your USD cents into Bitcoin Satoshi."

A lot from also applies here for people who find themselves on large sums of money. Do you have any other debts, and if so pay them off (you can treat it as an investment with a guaranteed return of your interest rate, something which does not exist in other investment vehicles). Do you have an emergency fund? If not, put these funds in it and leave it alone. 
If you already have a emergency fund, no debt or debt with a very low interest rate remaining, and you are perfectly fine with loosing all of it, then I suggest buying and holding BTC and throwing a little at alt currencies and see what sticks. If you are feeling more risky, buy some asicminer shares (I personally advise against this fearing that there is too much hype pushing share prices up), and if you are feeling extremely risky buy some shares in AMC as they are very cheap right now, but expect to loose your money regarding AMC.
The best possible investment I feel would be to buy some good books with your new found money and broaden your knowledge. Get some on economics, maybe start up a new hobby, or even better, take a class in something you would have not considered before, like welding. Hell, get a monthly subscription to wired and sign up to code academy or codeschool and start coding!
Don't bother building a mining rig using GPU's as you will likely never get your money back at this point. Buying an ASIC miner is risky since you do not know how quickly you will get yours before everyone else. You could always buy yourself a hefty gaming rig that you can use to teach yourself 3d animation and rendering while mining scrypt based coins on the side.
If I were in your position and had to invest in crypto's, I would put 20 bucks each of 5 alt coins you believe are risky but have possible futures. Buy half an asicminer share using something like TAT.ASICMINER, but maybe 200 shares of AMC just in case, buy two seats on nastymining, and hold the rest in the form of BTC in cold storage. And donate maybe 30 bucks to Nasa, some money to the LiteCoin dev's, and various BTC projects you see propping up, like bitcoinwisdom and listentobitcoin.

Here is what I feel, using uneducated deductions and whatnot. Bitcoin is rising quickly, very quickly. Now one could say why is it "quick"? I am going based on what the rise was last time we approached these numbers being similar to what we have now.
Usually when something goes up at this fast, as I understand it, there are corrections, which means dips on the way up as the market "tests" itself. As I understand it, the longer you go without such a correction then the higher the chances are that the market will overshoot the "real" value, causing a much more horrific and catastrophic dip later on.
Also, from what I understand, slow rises are favorable to sharp rises, since sharp rises are less likely to get a correction due to there being less time for a correction to happen. A slow rise allows people time to rethink their goals, rethink their thinking regarding how much the asset is worth, and more discussion.

I was wondering what on earth this is.


How could someone even predict something like this? If it were true, they wouldn't need to sell shares for capital. They would just wait a month or two and get what ever capital they would make from selling these shares.


Huh? There are no real staff on reddit from what I understand. Not to mention, Reddit is extremely self sufficient, subreddit mods handle their associated subreddits very well.


The heck? How would they choose who to send this to? Wouldn't the mods be first? Why specifically you when there are surely other users who have much more comment/link karma?
This is ridiculous guys, don't believe the message. As always, be mindful of scams, especially if something seems too good to be true (guaranteed income of $200 per month for a $400 investment?) Not to mention, reddit is doing fine on its own, if what they say is true, they don't need such capital. Since reddit in actuality makes very little money from what I understand, they would probably just ask people to buy more reddit gold.

You can right now just consider the filled in bar where most of the transactions occurred, and just a line as one weirdo selling or buying bitcoins at a price that is very far from the "normal" prices seen in the filled in bar.

Well, in the case of the guy in Cyprus, he had all his money in just one bank account. He put that large sum of money in the bank knowing full well that it is not insured above a certain amount. He could have either split up the money in various other bank accounts, which he can legally do so while remaining insured on all of them, or move them to any other investment vehicle. I am not familiar with how large companies handle their money, but I am quite sure that they have handle their money quite differently than we normal folk do.
Of course, gov't insurance on deposits only works as well as the gov't can handle a possible bank failure. It works very well and is quite reliable for countries which have very large economies, such as the USA and Russia, but does not work quite well for smaller countries where the government cannot handle much bank collapses at once.
As I said earlier, the insurance is per bank account, not per person. One person can legally have multiple bank accounts in multiple banks while still being insured at 100k per account. Once you have enough money that juggling with multiple bank accounts becomes problematic, chances are you have your own financial people who know more than us about handling large sums of money safely and effectively. But agreed, full reserve banks are a hell of a lot safer than fractional reserve banking, disregarding insuring the deposits. And agreed that how the non reserve money is handled based on models can be problematic if they models are using too many assumptions. Though, this is where the extensive regulation comes in, in this case, USA's. If the bank wishes to be FDIC insured, it has to agree to quite a bit of regulation.
I am doubtful that banks would be able to operate based just on fee's, but I am not sure. I am quite sure that you do not know either. But, I do agree that there should be some banks out there which you pay for in return for having it be a full reserve bank. Fractional reserve banking shouldn't be the only form of banking available, or at least have the option for banks which have variable percentages in reserve, for example 10% or 75% or which ever.

* They are using goddamn off the shelf power supplies?! What the flying hell! Not to mention they are goddamn EVGA, which while being extremely awesome for their warranty and whatnot, that awesomeness is irrelevant to business' products. At such scale, it is far cheaper to get a power supply specifically for your application without the warranty part of it. Replacing it is cheaper than paying for the possibility of replacing it. 
* I do not believe the power supply was causing havoc to the lines, EVGA PSU's are very good and not garbage, so instead I believe the wiring in the home might have been faulty. There is also a risk that the PSU itself was faulty.
* &gt;Also, if you didn’t notice, the LCD/Phone thingy in the front has been replaced by … a piece of cardboard spray painted black. Wonderful.
~~That lack of LCD on the front is blatant false advertising on BFL's part, the person should sue their ass for that to kingdom come. But,~~ When I look at the pictures I see both the back of the LCD (PCB) and the front of the LCD. Confused is me.
* &gt;The unit had to hit its huge power draw increase by putting dual EVGA consumer grade power supplies in the unit. We’re talking almost a 75 amp load (6*1500/120), disregarding power factor. He could very well overload the circuit panel and trip the main breaker for the house.
We do not know if both those PSU's are running at 100% load constantly, they might be there to handle peak load with the unit running at only 2kW on average, best way to test this is to get a current meter. Also, where did the six come from? I see two 1.5 kW PSU's that are meant for 120v, which assuming 100% load would result in 3,000 Watt / 120v = 25 Amps, which is enough to trip most home breakers of one circuit. An breaker for an entire USA based home is I think in the 200 Amps range though, but I could be completely wrong and should run to my basement and check. Also, I see thermaltake on the PSU in the picture, not EVGA.
* What the flying hell is going on with that USB hub? No way in hell for the premium they are charging and time they had they couldn't design an extremely simple USB hub specifically for this. It would have been far more cost efficient. Such a massive waste of USB cables and space. Not to mention that hot glue is a huge failure point and might possibly fail, resulting in the user needing to open the unit and plug it back in again later.
* What the shit is electrical tape like that doing there!? What is wrong with friggen heat shrink? Hell, what about using a proper connector and wiring harness in this thing? Again, based on how much time they had and the premium, this is unacceptable.
* What is going on with the ribbon cable to an LCD? Why was it cut that way instead of using the correct ribbon cable and connectors in the first place?
* Why are they mis mashing which screws they use? That is extra cost in assembly as well as having to handle another supply for no good reason.
I was hoping to see the PCBs inside or something more, but ah well. All in all, it looks like a very amateurish construction, with the use of many off the shelf components when the price and amount of time this has taken to ship makes that completly unacceptable, and there was probably little to no EMI testing and whatnot done with this resulting in a lack a UL or CE certification. Hopefully the website owner reads this and checks if there is any UL or CE logo (UL is meant for the USA and I think the world, CE is for the EU). I would be extremely surprised if they did. For anyone not familiar with what these logo's mean, they are for the most part logo's indicated that the product was tested to see how it behaves when failing or in general use to protect the public from dangerously designed products. The pictures are fantastic and hopefully there will be more in the future!
Edit: I do not think it fare to compare how much BTC was when purchased as means of breaking even. Anyways, using the coinish.com calculator, I get (assuming 20 cents kwH, product cost of 22,480 USD) a break even of 27.8 days when assuming a dif increase of 1.2788% per day. Though, the first estimate used on the site is a good example of what would have happened if you just kept your BTC. Anyways, using conish again and assuming the cost was actually 156,000 USD, I get a break-even of never.
Edit 2: I really like this guys second half of the post and it is very valid. If this thing does cause damage to your property and the insurance company finds out it started because of this un-certified product, they will most likely not give you any insurance money.

These are not chip making machines. On a circuit board you have components and the PCB, with the PCB holding the components, furthermore the components can be IC's(chips) or passive components like resistors and capacitors. The machines you saw handle putting the components onto the PCB are used in the assembly stage of a product, with some of these machines being called pick and place machines.
 
Getting a career specifically as working with these assembly machines I do not know, but the field in general is known as EE, or electrical engineering. EE's deal with designing the products, from what components to use, how to use the components, and often times the people who are working in these types of lines are EE's. If you want to know about how to design chips themselves, you need a good bit of schooling just like an EE would.
Designing chips is known as what the other user said, micro/nano fabrication or IC design. You need to not only know EE (if you want to be able to design analog based IC's), you also need to get brushed up on basic chemistry, a good bit of high level math (calc 3, linear equations, differential algebra, etc), and of course some physics, all of which would be pointed out to you in schooling. 
If you are interested, I recommend first learning some basic electronics (what is a capacitor, resistor, transistor) and then start getting familiar with micro-controllers, like an Arduino setup. Here is an example: 
Once you are comfortable with dabbling in projects using microcontrollers and some analog stuff, you can look at FPGA's, which you can consider for now as a simulator of a chip. You write code using an HDL that describes a chip, and then that code gets compiled and sent to an FPGA which runs the code. Using an HDL like Verilog you can write your own processor without spending any significant money, and if you want you can actually get it fabricated at a company for a grand or two.
For an FPGA setup, here is a cheap yet capable for your purposes kit.
You can find tons of really good books on amazon which may be outdated but still very valid for very cheap, here is an example:

They would need to use something like bitpay, but since this is amazon we are talking about, it would probably make more sense for them to roll out such a service themselves. They might even make an exchange of sorts meant only for amazon &lt;-&gt;bitcoin users to get around relying on MTgox's recent horror shows. This would be a very expensive investment in a currency that so far has been very unstable.

This. Being able to take out a "loan" over the duration of a week, no questions asked, instantly, at 0% is in my opinion a FANTASTIC feature of credit cards. And if you have good credit, you can even stack the cards to get above a 20,000 line of credit! There is no other method I can think of which has such a perk. Not to mention, if it gets stolen you get a new one and don't loose your money, some offer things such as extending warranties. Hell, some cards even offer 0% interest over the course of a FEW MONTHS! They even offer you protection in the form of a charge back!
But, if you use a card wrong, like thinking that your line of credit is essentially free money, or having an outstanding balance month after month, then you will put yourself in a horrific ditch which is very hard to crawl out of later. But, like I said, this is if you use it improperly. Credit card companies only effect you negatively if you use them improperly, and by making companies charge a smidgen higher due to the CC company charging the store for CC usage.
I feel this is like someone being enraged against C++. You have great power and flexability with C++, but you can easily screw yourself over.
Also, do not forget, a **credit** card is a card which allows you to buy stuff on **credit**. Bitcoin does not exist to buy things on credit, it is not here to replace credit cards. You may argue it is meant to replace debit cards though!

The pay most certainly is not good unless you are with a full blown professional escort service, in which case you would be earning some big serious money.

A good bit of the porn that you see online has to be payed for somehow. Getting payed via just advertising is a somewhat risky endevour, so instead it is sometimes considered "safer" to have the porn be under a brand name of sorts, such as Brazzers.
Not to mention, do you know how much money Brazzers makes? CDgirls also makes a good bit of money from what I remember. 
Subscribers to sites like Brazzars get a good bit more stuff than us "normal" folk, for example they get interactive webcam shows where the pornstars do their thing while getting feedback from a TV somewhere and sometimes doing shoutouts. It was one of the funniest things I have ever seen, but also for some people it gives great satisfaction to hear and see their favorite pornstar give a shoutout to their name. I am talking high quality stuff here by the way, not some crappy $25 dollar webcam in some random room, but instead some full blown HD cameras, a 1080p stream, multiple camera angles, some of the top stars like Askaira (I think thats her name), and the guys are not all chubby loud breathing "Yeah Yeah Yeah" people.
There is also another company, I forgot their name, who has a castle or dungeon thing in the beginning of each of their videos. They too make a huge amount of money based just on subscribers. They are also pushing for lots of new ideas, such as actual meetups with stars on the roof of their building every few weeks. There was an AMA about the guy that runs the company with lots of very interesting and cool stuff. I can't find the AMA after a solid ten minutes of looking. :(
Anyways, the porn industry financially rivals the film industry actually! There are tons of subscribers for tons of porn websites. Not to mention that the days of that really weird 80's porn are long behind us, with the recent movement towards having much higher quality porn. Pretty fascinating field!

They would have to convert from BTC to USD or what ever currency they normally use as soon as possible after the sale is done, and vice versa for returns. The extremely volatile nature of BTC currently is what, I feel, is preventing mass adoption of BTC by stores and the public. Converting from USD to BTC can take more than a few days if using coinbase, or an hour or so if physically going to a bank. This needs to be simpler and require as little effort as possible for mass adoption.
For stores, that means relying on a third party, like gox, to handle all their USD and BTC transactions, which for them is most likely extremely risky.

I am somewhat doubtful, but can't really say for sure. They could be using it for prototypes, but since they are planning on rolling out at least a few thousand of the chips it is safe to assume that they will be using full blown fab for the actual production, in which case they are probably getting some form of discount from the fab for the prototype chips.
Also, it is very important to use the same fab for prototyping and production due to process variations between each fab. From what I understand, ST does not lend out time at their fabs for production of non ST die's. These types of programs are mostly for universities from what I see. When companies do their real ASIC design, they do the prototyping using discounts from the fab they wish to use for mass production, though I could be wrong.

Therefore, the representatives are backed by the people, which means that the policies which these representatives make are backed by the people indirectly, and going even further, it means that the policies in effect are also backed indrectly by the people.

"Just kids playing around on the internet" Yes, just passed 2 billion dollar market cap playing around?

~~I also want to point out that the more competitors there are, the more asicminer can actually mine. They said that they do not want to go over 30% of the network hash rate, so excess equipment is sold to other miners for them to still make money. They would make more money mining themselves though. When there is more competition, the less the have to sell and the more that they could mine themselves.~~ 
Not to mention, the more competitiors there are, the more drive there is to push more capital into bitcoin mining companies, increasing their legitimacy somewhat, not to mention the PR regarding (AsicMiner now valued over $200 million from 0 million in less than a year) is really good, especially to outside investors who are willing to hold a very risky asset in return for crazy returns (%300 in less than a year? Holy balls).
Also, more competition is good because there will be competition to get higher hash rate per dollar, resulting in an even higher hash rate for BTC. Earlier, if you wanted a high hash rate a GPU at 300 Mhash/s would suffice, but these days you can get a full blown 10 Ghash/s miner for only 5 grand that pulls a measly 90 watts. If bitcoin were to fail in the form of falling to less than 10 bucks per BTC or even less, these machines cannot be used for anything else, only mining, resulting in the network probably retaining a resonable hash rate, preventing bitcoin from actually dying.

Unfortunately, the speed that the blockchain is downloaded is horrifically slow compared to well seeded torrents. If the entire blockchain is indeed 10GB, then on a 15 MegaBit/s connection it would take me only 5333 seconds, or about 1.5 hours, but instead it takes almost two days.

Well, I will keep the Raw files on hand just in case. If you do not know, or others who do not know, camera's take images and usually compress them into a JPEG file, which causes you to loose detail not really visible to your eyes (features in shadows, color). You can have the camera output RAW files, which are uncompressed versions of the image with tons of detail intact, allowing you to have much more flexibility when editing, for example you can up the exposure in lightroom on a raw file to bring out the floor from under a chair in a somewhat dark room and under exposed image.

The idea is that you are not paying for set hardware when purchasing asicminer shares, but instead a percentage of all network hashing power. Asicminer seems to show that they can easily and quickly ramp up their hash power significantly but do not wish to do so for fear of bitcoin hashing becoming too centralized, so they sell their excess supply of hashing power in the form auctions for Erupter Blades and Erupter USB sticks, which shareholders recieve profits from in the form of higher dividends.
In short, you are purchasing shares in a company that sells mining hardware as well as seemingly being able to ramp up their hash rate very quickly and cheaply, meaning you are purchasing a percentage of all possible hashing power instead of a set amount of hashing power.
Of course, this is my interpretation of AsicMiner, and you are fully free to research them on your own and reach your own conclusions.

The people with liquid nitrogen and whatnot are most likely extreme overclockers and not miners. 
For example, you can buy a processor from Intel which runs at 3.2 Ghz (Giga Hertz) at stock, meaning Intel guarantees the processor to run correctly and without any problems at 3.2 Ghz. This means that, for the sake of extreme simplification, the processor is executing around 3.2 billion instructions per second. If you want the processor to run faster, you can make increase its clock frequency, which is the Ghz number, but this also makes the processor run a lot warmer because it is doing more executions per second. This results in it needing more cooling, such as more fans or a larger heatsink, which helps transfer heat from the processor to the surrounding air.
Most people overclock to make their processor go faster when gaming, causing their game to be more responsive. You can often times make a processor be as fast as a more expensive processor by just over clocking it. This also happens with graphic cards, which you can consider as a processor meant just for graphical stuff, like shadows and displaying more detailed characters.
At a point, your processor becomes unstable because you are making it go too fast while keeping everything else constant. One way to rectify this problem is by increasing the voltage that it runs at. For example, a jump from 0.955 volts to 1.050 volts can allow you to make your processor get an extra 0.2 Ghz faster, but producing a much larger amount of heat. So now, you have a problem of even more heat. After a while, a simple heat sink and fan is not enough to move enough heat from the processor, so you start using water cooling, meaning you cool the processor by passing water through a block of copper attached to the processor.
Now, lets say you want to make your procesor go EVEN faster. You now have even more heat, and you can't give it much more voltage without destroying the processor. The next step is phase change, meaning you attach a system that operates just like in air conditioners and refrigerators. This allows your processor to run at sub zero temperatures and pump out massive amounts of heat.
And here is the limit, you want to push as much performance out of your processor as possible. You don't care if it will be destroyed in a few hours, minutes, or even seconds, you want it the fastest you can get it to go. Why? Not for actual performance reasons, since it wouldn't last too long to probably even load up the game in time. Instead, usually long enough to run a few benchmarks lasting a few minutes and get the speed rating of the computer through programs like FutureMark. This is done for contests, funded by companies who made the bench marking programs, the companies who designed the processors, and associated components. People who are known for their ability to overclock well can get flown in from across the country for this even! And such funding is required for these events and contests due to the components costing well in the thousands, not to mention the cost to have a truck to drive there full of Liquid Nitrogen or Liquid Helium. 
What the people do is attach a pot to the processor and other critical components, such as the graphic card and important chips on the main circuit board, known as the motherboard. This pot is usually made of copper, and is just a cylinder that you pour your LN2 into. This causes the processor to reach very, very low temperatures, Easily -100c. At this point, due to the mechanics of semiconductors and some nifty physics, the processor becomes more stable at even extreme clock frequency even if you are using the same voltage. Also, because the LN2 takes heat away extremely quickly, you are no longer limited by how much heat the processor gives of, so your only remaining limits to making the processor run faster are stability and clock frequency. So, now you can bump the voltage even more, allowing you to reach higher clock speeds. Liquid Helium is the best you can go, since it is even colder than Liquid Nitrogen, but it is also MUCH more expensive.
From what I have seen, over clocking your components does not give much better mining performance that much. Mining these days is done on the GPU since GPU's are designed to do lots of stuff in parallel, while CPU's are designed to do more stuff in series. Mining benefits from it being as parallel as possible, hence now working on GPU's instead of CPU's like it was originally a few years ago. We are beginning to shift to ASIC's, (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), or simply chips designed specifically for mining. These chips can easily cost millions to design and start production, but since they are made specifically for mining, they are MUCH faster at mining while using much less power. Simply put, they take only the parts of a processor needed to mine, and copy those parts hundreds of times on the chip. Since 100% of the parts on the chip are designed specifically for mining, it uses less power and can do it faster. 
Right now, there are a few companies that made these chips. One is Avalon, who has already made a few thousand and sold them, but if you want to buy them now it costs a few grand and you have to wait a few months. Another company is ButterFly Labs, who are now a days considered for the most part to be a scam. They are over 150 days late on shipping their product, they have shown a video of their chip but people are doubting that the chip within the video was real, and they have been quite unresponsive to their customers. They shipped a product many months ago which worked as intended, but all their later products have yet to see the light of day. There is also a third company who is known to be real and whatnot, but I forgot their name and I can't seem to find it via a quick google right now. These ASIC's are the next step after mining with graphic cards. When they finally start getting shipped out, the difficulty in mining will sky rocket, resulting in GPU miners becoming just barely profitable, if profitable at all, because the people mining with ASIC's are competing with the GPU miners. Since the ASIC miners are much much faster, they take a much larger ratio of the profit from mining.
Instead, some miners are beginning to shift to alternate crypto coins, which are based on Bitcoin. One of them is called LiteCoin, which is mined using an algorithm known as Scrypt, instead of Bitcoins Algorithm known as SHA-256. Scrypt requires a massive amount of memory, which is very expensive to put in ASIC's, so the idea is that there won't be a Scrypt ASIC miner for a very very long time, allowing GPU miners to mine on it without the risk of ASIC miners coming in and taking their profit. Litecoin is still a very small currency, with a market cap of around 35 million USD, a far cry from Bitcoins recent 1 billion USD market cap, but it is gaining momentum slowly, and has remained surprisingly stable with the recent bubbles bitcoin encountered.
Here are some charts for Litecoin and Litecoin on an exchange alternative from MtGox.
And here is a small table thing to say how profitable it is to mine different currencies.
 For example, my current mining GPU, a 7950 which costs $300 off newegg.com gives me 580 Khash/s for Scrypt and 500 Mhash/s on SHA-256, all while pulling 200 Watts, with a cost of 10 cents per KiloWatt Hour. If I were to mine Bitcoin, I would make $2.10 per day, including power costs. If I mine Litecoin, I make $3.58 per day. Since I make more mining Litecoin, I am now mining litecoin instead of bitcoin. Just a week ago, the difficulty for litecoin was almost 50% lower than what it is now while costing 2 USD per litecoin. This resulted in me making $15 per day instead of the current $4.00 per day I am making now. The difficulty rose because more miners switched to the currency, giving me a smaller percentage of the total profits. Bitcoin mining operates under the same idea. Hence, once ASIC miners come in with their MUCH faster mining capabilities, the difficulty will rise so high that chances are GPU miners won't be able to make a profit when mining Bitcoin using SHA-256. The idea behind Litecoin is that the miners will go to Litecoin to remain profitable. Will this shift actually happen? Who knows. Anyways, this is why it is now not recommended to buy a new mining rig for Bitcoin if it is not an ASIC, because you won't be able to get a positive return on your investment in a reasonable amount of time, if ever, due to ASIC's coming in so soon.
Difficulty information:
TLDR; So yeah, the rigs cooler with Liquid nitrogen and Liquid Helium are used for overclocking contests. They are not stable enough for mining, you would have to replace components after they are destroyed probably every few days, and the cost of cooling with with LN2 or Phase change would probably be more than can be made by mining them. Bitcoin is mined with SHA-256, and ASIC's are already being designed for SHA-256, causing the difficulty to possibly sky rocket, resulting in GPU miners no longer being profitable. ASIC miners are MUCH faster than GPU miners while pulling much less power. Hence Litecoin, GPU miners might shift to Litecoin, but this is very unkown. It is not recommended to buy a new mining rig for Bitcoin due to ASIC's coming out very soon (within the next month or two).
Disclaimer: I own some bitcoins, Litecoins, a tiny bit of NameCoins and PP coins, and I am a miner who has recently switched to Litecoins. I do not know absalutly everything, and what I have said above is simplified in places. Please feel free to ask any more questions, we are all glad to answere and provide more information!

Absolutely, there are no regulations going on regarding these assets, hence why BTCT shut down and Bitfunder was so stressed out leading to that shutdown too. Another sign of no regulation is they are using a form of accounting which they shouldn't be using. Some guy on bitcointalk explained specifically what is up, but it went over my head as I am not into accounting. There are no legal measures in place that would require freidcat to not run away with all of our BTC and just mine all by himself, but as has said, he has been reliable in the past and somewhat transparant.

Day trading is for the most part buy low and sell high more than once a day. Some people day trade by initiating trades every minute or even few seconds, while others day trade by trading every few hours. Since bitcoin is extremely volatile, if you are a good day trader then you can make some very good money very quickly.
The thing is though, that with day trading you can end up loosing money quicly as well as being extremely stressed out, leading to mistakes. It is not for everyone.

I do not feel that the comment so far explain well enough what an ETF is.
The reasoning behind an ETF is somewhat similar to a mutual fund, meaning lets say you want to invest in the Brazilian Technology sector with less than 5 grand USD. One way is to buy stocks in one technology company in Brazil, but you introduce more risk in the form that if that one company fails, you loose everything. So now you will buy stocks in many seperate technology companies in Brazil, but what happens if you have a company that has a share worth 5 grand USD? Well, you can't buy part of one share, so you can't buy that share. In short, you are limited to companies who have a low cost per share.
In comes an ETF or a mutual fund, which can buy many assets, or shares in a company that costs more than 10 grand each, but many other shares at the same time. Each share in an ETF or mutual fund represents the total shares of the company, with each share having the ability to represent less than one share of the other company. You can buy a $100 share of a fund which contains hundreds of shares in other companies, with your share representing a percentage of other shares.
An ETF has the idea that it represents an index, so you can buy a Brazilian developing market ETF which is meant to symbolize the Brazilian economy as well as possible. When Brazils economy rises, your ETF rises because it contains a small share of their economy in the form of holding stocks of companies within brazil.
A real world example. Lets say you want to invest in the American technologya sector since you think it will rise. You can buy shares of each company but you only have five grand, which is just enough for one share of apple and a few other companies, not what you want since you want as broad exposure to technology as possible. After some googling around and looking at various ETF's, you find iShares North American Tech ETF.
That ETF contains many of the largest tech companies in the USA, and looking at its "Top Ten Holdings" shows that each share in that ETF contains 8.6% Microsoft, 7.88% Apple, 7.84% Google, 6.6% IBM, and so on. Each share of this ETF costs only about 75 bucks, which gives you exposure to many of the large companies, some of which you probably never heard of.
This Bitcoin ETF works somewhat on the same principle, meaning that it holds Bitcoins as an asset, and people can buy and sell a share representing 0.20 BTC. They should have thrown in some companies like AsicMiner as well to make it a better index, but this is now over my head somewhat. Anyways, this ETF allows investors to buy and sell BTC without having to actually touch BTC or an exchange.
Also, check out the wiki, it does a good job explaining what it is in much detail: 
And investopedia for a shorter explanation: 
It even has a video!

I completely agree with your feelings towards the somewhat extreme ideologies which are starting to gravitate towards bitcoin. I feel it is appropriate to cp something I wrote a few days ago regarding bitcoin and some of the more extreme viewpoints within it.

I think we actually did freak out a little, but lets not forget that at that point bitcoin survived two catastrophic bubbles. The first one, many months ago, when it rose to $35 and then collapsed, and later when it rose to $266 and then "reset" to around $150. There was less panic because bitcoin survived two horrific bubbles, so we have the assumption that it will survive the further bubbles.

The issues is that the current BTC crowdfunding sites have a very small audience. You need to be familiar of BTC, have BTC, be familiar with this site, and be willing to spend BTC on specific project on the site, all of which results in a drastically smaller audience than kickstarter, going further, resulting in an even smaller amount of possible money floating around there.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:50:33
It is very real, Avalon is the only company (I think) that has actually shipped out their ASIC's which all work exactly as spec. The problem is that they have a massive backlog currently of orders, each handled in batches. If you order now, expect to wait a good few months to get your unit, which by the time you get it will probably be too slow to get a return in a meaningful amount of time. 
It is also quite risky because if bitcoin does crash and burn, along with other cryptocurrencies, then you have a very expensive paperweight, since you cannot re purpose it to do anything else. No bruteforce password cracking, no running for Seti or Folding at home, and you can't render or play games on it. I personally consider much riskier than a graphic card.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:50:56
Thank god I am not the only one. I often times see people saying they put a good portion of their savings in bitcoin. Yes, bitcoin is pretty cool and may indeed rise to a few grand in the future, but it is damn volatile as hell. What happens if they need money now, while the value has dropped like a rock?
What if the price crashes for whatever reason? It is still an insanely risky asset.
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:31:54
Huh, a response!


There are two ways that it is possible to reconfigure this unit to do these very different things, such as mining scrypt coins and 3d rendering and even file compression. One is either have an ASIC like I described and change the functionality on a software level, which is very doubtful, or the second option, have the user physically open the unit, de-attach the liquid nitrogen cooling system, take out the PCB (assuming asic's are soldered) or take the asic out of its socket, and put in the new asic which is capable of 3d rendering and whatnot. I stand by what I said earlier regarding that it is prohibitively expensive to have asic implementations of mining litecoins and 3d rendering and file compression all on the same die, so that would mean different asic's for different functionality, which further results in the unit being able to do only one thing at once (mining vs 3d rendering vs file compression). Unless of course they are using some sort of architecture similar to what GPU's have today, which is many small "cores" working in parallel.
Even if they were using the many small cores technique, you will still have a massive die, which is very expensive (die's are priced for the most part based on feature size and die size). Keep in mind that the current GPU implementations for rendering are from Nvidia and Ati, and those cards cost a good bit of money due to die size and engineering costs, which Crypteks has not shown any sign of getting around. Lets not forget that they are still using their superconducting asic material, which is a massive cost in of itself, and they are somehow using this new material at a 32nm feature size?! 


This seems very infeasible from everything I know about EE, and even though I am still just a student, I still firmly believe that based on my knowledge what you are saying is utter bull-honky. If you are honestly telling the truth, then you **need** to give more information to the general public, or this will be all just dismissed as a scam, since you have to admit, in all honesty, it shares so many features with a scam. It has the very well done and flashy presentation, the promise of a beautiful product capable of nearly everything you can imagine, little to no information on how your claims are actually true, as of now no 3rd party verifying you, as well as the albeit limited association of your previous kickstarter failure. Though, I do have to hand it to you, that box is very damn sexy, I would kill to have that as a square coffee table.


Please point out other assumptions you feel are inappropriate or wrong, as it would present more information about this product to further prove or disprove your claims so anyone who might purchase it in the future will be better able to make a more informed decision. The removal of the liquid nitrogen by allowing it to evaporate is most certainly not common sense based on how little information was provided. If this was a closed loop, then the same laws of physics apply as moving a normal windows AC. You can move a windows AC while it is running, though admittingly putting it upside down is not a good idea due to the oil from the compressor no longer preforming its function that well (AC people feel free to chime in, I only know basic AC things from when I was considering a phase change system for cooling my old Q6600 when overclocking), as the nitrogen gas is stored within the loop at all times at a high pressure state. It makes no difference to the gaseous nitrogen what orientation it is. Now, if this is an open loop, with the cooling done by having the liquid nitrogen drip from a cooled tube as is done in laboratory environments to generate liquid nitrogen, then moving it while it is running will possibly cause the LN2 to spill and indeed damaging components not designed for low temperatures, and that makes total sense. 
But then you reach a good bit of other issues. If this is an open loop, that means that the entire inside of the unit would need to be required to be filled with only nitrogen gas, which therefore means it is airtight, which means further that the only method heat will escape the unit is via conduction (the components inside are in contact with the metal case, which would then via radiation and convection release heat to the surrounding air), or via the condensers which would be outside the unit. This still does not solve the issue of throwing out over 2 Kw of heat to surrounding air, but lets leave that be. The open loop is done by cooling the surrounding nitrogen gas to such a low temperature that it liquefies and drips down into the pot which is above the ASIC. You are cooling 2 Kilowatts, a far cry from a processor which throws out at most 250 watts under extreme overclocking, and you claim to be doing that all with just around a few square feet of nitrogen gas, assuming that the nitrogen is stored at normal pressures. If not, you better be using some proper engineering for those walls of the unit, because then that is a seriously dangerous thing to do, keeping a high pressure vessel in your living space. After all, there is good reason why those cylindrical tanks used to store gases for welding are actually chained down.
Anyways, to get an idea of the volume of LN2 needed to cool a 250 Watt processor, here is a video of an old AMD overclocking record. Look at the two tanks they have sitting next to them to get a feel for the amount of liquid helium they are using.
There is no way on earth you can have so much volume of gaseous nitrogen to cool 2 thousand watts of heat in such a small unit, especially when you consider that nitrogen's expansion ratio is 700 times. This is assuming the nitrogen is kept inside the unit at low pressures. Higher pressures would, as I said earlier, be extremely dangerous to keep in your living area.
There is some more I would like to add to this but I already wrote a good bit to satisfy any questions regarding your two rebuttles, and I am still hoping someone who is more familiar with phase change, EE, semiconductor fabrication, or just simple physics would chime in and point some other things out which I surely missed.
One last thing which is very interesting is this:


How are users supposed to upgrade their units later, especially if requires detaching the LN2 cooling system and physically swapping the asics, which I think we agree, is the heart of this machine. Also, lets say that you do send a unit to btcbible and it gets at least 1 Thash/s, indicating that you made due on your claims regarding performance. How will BTCbible verify your claims about the liquid nitrogen cooling, which you are advertising as a feature on your product? One way would be to measure any differences in the amount of nitrogen in the surrounding area, yes, but it still does not proove that you are actually cooling your asic's using LN2.
Also, lastly, what on earth is this suppoused to mean, and why is it hidden in fine print?


So it appears that the only limitation for higher hash rates is on the software end? Why does this limitation exist? Why not jump it to full performance considering that the user cannot modify the cooling later him/herself, showing that the original designs were intended to reach their advertised 100% performance? Unless of course this is some very shady advertising you have going on right there.

I want to point out that you should make yourself look as rational/professional as possible. I noticed for example that you sometimes start of sentences with lower case, use lower case I, and extend the o's in so. That would make you appear to be very young or immature, and with bitcoin by itself behind hard enough already, additional negative qualities would make it even harder.
In these types of situations I usually do not try to portray BTC as something new or revolutionary, which causes it to seem established already. Instead I go for things like BTC has over a billion and half market cap, select merchants already accept it for payment, you can either handle exchanging BTC to fiat yourself or use a third party like bitpay which is for very simple purposes analogous to paypal, and using that third party service to exchange automatically very quickly makes the wild fluctuations irreverent to the buisness. Mainly though, these services have much lower fee's (just conversion fee which is about 1% I think), do not allow charge backs which results in less fee's, and allows a rapidly expanding market to directly use your services.
Also, naming some of these merchants is a good idea, so they know it is not just some random one person basement buisness. Namecheap.com for example.

Production costs for those are absalutly minimal. The PCB in quantaty costs maybe two bucks at most. The single ASIC is probably something like also two dollars, ignoring the R&amp;D costs. The FT2232 or MCU they are using is around four dollars depending on the source. The case (I think it is plastic) costs maybe five bucks if it is plastic molded. The USB connector is maybe three dollars. Keep in mind I am mostly pulling numbers out of my ass, there are somewhat educated guesses.
They are selling them at such high prices because there is still massive demand for some reason, and they want to recoup their R&amp;D costs as quickly as possible, while also giving shareholders and themselves a good bit of profit. They are probably right at an idea point on the demand curve where they make more on the smaller quantities yet higher prices than larger quantities and lower prices.

They are there for good reason, and we are talking about proper engineers here. These are people with a good bit of full blown schooling behind them, and they themselves are very involved in designing these regulations and codes.

Does not work like that sadly. The major cost for making ic's is the NRE, or costs which remain the same regardless of how many you produce. Designing an IC like that would still cost them swaths of money, and then they have to develop the masks for it and whatnot which can easily reach a few million USD. You need different mask's for different ic's, you can't just stick a seperate ic design onto a mask.
Not to mention they do not have their own fab anymore, so they have to pay the fab for each ic produced.

My line of reasoning was that if has already had his relationship pushed so far to the edge, and lost so much money, then at such a point what would be the trade off of finalizing the losses versus allowing himself more room to either fail or recoup the losses. 
What would you suggest he should do? I agree that leaving the savings in bitcoin is risky, and instead of loosing just 80% he could loose 100%, but at the very least there is a chance that the money could return. Though, this is money that he and his family are likely to be very dependent on and hold huge amounts of sentimental value to them as it took so much work and time to get, so this situation for him is likely creating feelings which I can't imagine. It also greatly depends on the situation. If the rest of the family is treating their savings as lost, then he might as well not make the loss permanent but instead a possibility. 
But yes, what would you suggest he do? Also, I realize that this may be read in an angry or aggressive tone, I did not intend for it to do that. I am interested in your opinion though.

No, not out of nothing. They are using your money in order to give out loans to other people, such as yourself. Those loans carry an interest rate which the bank gets as profit. The money is created by lending others money.
If you are worried about them making a profit and not giving anything back, go to a credit union which is required, by law, to give a significant percentage of their profits back either in the form of community projects or share holders (you count as one since you are their customer) as dividends every month on your available cash balance.

If it was 900 Khash/s for Bitcoin, I would assume it would be 900 hash/s for Litecoin. This is using the idea that I get around 500 Mhash/s for SHA-256 and 580 Khash/s for Scrypt using a 7950.

Absolutely agreed. For reference, hairdryers/blowers that some girls use to dry their hair after washing it can easily pull 2,000 Watts. That hairdryer thing can actually burn their hair if they are not careful, and just putting your hand in front of it shows just how much heat we are dealing with.
And as you said, a machine that consumes 2.8 Kw will give off 2.8 Kw. It does not magically absorb heat and release it in some other way, and therefore, according to the laws of conservation of energy, that energy will be given off somehow, which in this case will be heat.
To play devils advocate though, such high heat output would probably be used for the compressor to convert the Nitrogen gas into liquid nitrogen. But still, that means that most of the heat will be given off as air, so you will have, somewhat similarly, a hair blower/dryer blasting in your room 24/7.
Lastly, lets not forget, that a machine pulling 2.8 Kw 24/7 results in a monthly usage of 2.8 * 24 hours * 30 days = 2016 KwH, or 2.016 Megawatt hours! Assuming you pay ten cents per KwH, that is 2016 * 0.10 = $201.6 monthly in electricity costs. 
Going off on the deep end, such a high and quick jump in electricity usage might signal to the FDA that you are suddenly growing weed or something. Unlikely, but still somewhat humorous.

Gyft pretty much satisfies nearly everything regarding wanting to spend bitcoins, but I feel that we should aim for maximum awareness of BTC. Something like amazon accepting bitcoin payments would be flat out amazing and probably throw the "monopoly money" phrase out the window. Google accepting payments via BTC for adsense would also be pretty cool.
More feasible targets would probably be companies which are primarily young people so we can "latch on" their minds. I am under the assumption that older people are less open about the idea of bitcoin than younger people, hence this idea. For example, places like hautelook, American Eagle, American Apperal, Victorias secret, Vending machines would be a big plus.
Netflix would be fantastic. Redbox would be interesting. Fandango would be pretty cool too. Star bucks, hulu.

Well, we are referring to universities who don't need the amount of dies where NRE costs are no longer a large percentage of total costs, hence using grouping sales.
I was under the impression that some universities had their own equipment for large feature size IC's, but I could be wrong. If they need a small feature size, assuming they are a well funded uni, they can always do e-beam lithography which can go down to single digit nm from what I have seen. Cheaper but godly slow.

Now this is interesting, I have heard of asic miner and looked at their thread on bitcointalk but never fully understood. Their shares are no longer being released, so you have to instead buy the shares from older investors like on any stock market, 
Once you buy the shares you get paid in dividends instead of the share price going up?
They pay dividends every seven or seventeen days?
Currently, the dividend rate is between 46 and 28 percent.

What the hell? Are you referring to Western Union, or the people who use Western Union? WU makes a living transporting money from one location to the other by charging fees, why else would they be in business?
Poor people as in they they do not have money, or poor people as if "Aww, those poor people! I feel so sorry for them!"? Regardless, again, they are a business, they are in it to make money. If you do not like then, there are other options, but seeing as to how they are still in business, it appears that people are still using them.
Also, if WU picked up bitcoin, it would give a massive boom to bitcoin in the form of lowering the barrier to entry significantly, which is extremely good for both Bitcoin and us early adopters. We currently need adoption for bitcoin to thrive, it is critical. Not to mention this would offer Western Union a spot in the future if Bitcoin does actually grow to what we hope it will, keeping them in buisness.

You need to take into consideration when the box will arrive. If you order it today and it gets to you in a few months, you will likely never get back the BTC you payed for it. It would be more economical for you to just buy BTC and hold BTC.

Is there any way you can have a Bit-Card with a very small amount on it, say $1 or even just a few cents? It can be used by people aware of bitcoin to spread the word to their friends and whatnot.
"Hey, have you heard about Bitcoin?"
"Nope, what it is?"
"Some meh explanation of Bitcoin." *Hands them a very cool looking Bit-Card with a few cents on it* "I just handed you money in Bitcoin! Just go on your computer, either take a picture or view the digital looking squares with a webcam and the program will create a wallet for you and the funds will be immediately transferred to your wallet from the card!"
This way, the individual is incentivised to actually check bitcoin out by wanting to get the money on the card. It also gives the indivudal a small amount of bitcoin to play with, shows the person what the process is to get bitcoins via Bit-Card for more bitcoins as future reference, and you can also tell the person that a year ago, that sum was worth just 1/10th of a penny.
Of course, the card will probably cost more than the few cents, but it is still a cheap way to get possibly thousands of people involved and interested in Bitcoin.

~~SHA256 is 256 bit encryption. Based on my limited understanding, that means that each hash is 256 bit's long. Each ASCII character is 1 byte, or 8 bits.~~
~~256 / 8 = 32 characters ... huh, I am doing this wrong.~~
~~Ok, here is an example SHA256 hash off wiki: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855~~
~~64 chararcters. Each character seems to be limited to lower case letters and numbers 0-9, or 26 letters + 10 ~~digits, or 36 characters.~~
~~64 spots ^ 36 = 105312291668557186697918027683670432318895095400549111254310977536 or roughly 105 vigintillion possible combinations, or roughly 1.0531 * 10^65.~~
~~A peta is 1 * 10 ^15~~
~~10^65 / 10^15 = 10^50 seconds, or 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 seconds, or 100 quindecillion seconds. That is 3.171×10^42 years, or 2.3*10^23 times older than the universe.~~

It is being paranoid regarding keeping a computer offline, using a live boot linux distro, printer offline too, and other such nonsense. 
If you do go the USB route, make sure you have a backup if that flash drive gets lost, wet, your cat eats it, someone steps on it, lighting strikes it, it magically grows feet and becomes sentiant and runs away, or anything else. You essentially make a backup. Heck, put that backup in a box at a bank or something if you so desire, encrypted with some phrase only you know.
Here is what I would do if I had a large sum of BTC. Keep 90% in cold storage, meaning a key on a flash drive hidden away with a paper backup. Or just keep a paper backup at two separate banks even. Every month, go to the bank and send some BTC from your main account into a "temporary" account, where you keep small amounts (less than $500 USD worth) that you use for shopping.
My option is somewhat paranoid too, but I feel it has less unknowns. If you are going the rabserry pi route, just go get a beaglebone instead so you get more bang for your buck (faster, smaller, better form factor, etc).

Down the trip of very recent memory lane, this song thing is very cool to look back on.
I still remember the price going up and up, promising myself to sell my initial investment once it reaches $250. Sadly I was sleeping and did not expect it to rise to a bit above $250 so quickly, so I never put in an order. Then watching the value plummet hour after hour once I woke up was a fun ride. Oh the horror! Though, I never sold, and have still yet to sell anything, hip hip hooray!

The differences for when you look at LTC and something such as BTC and most other coins are indeed not breathtaking. There are differences though.


Nope to your nope? Memory is very expensive in terms of die size, much more expensive than an SHA-256 or Scrypt block. Heck, memory is one of the most if not the most expensive cost for an IC, disregarding engineering/design costs. I am assuming we agree that Scrypt uses a order of magnitude more memory than SHA-256? How much more exactly I am not sure, but I feel comfortable saying at least ten times. This will result in the IC needing to either have more memory on the die or a DDR2/DDR3 interface which results in increased costs due to the PCB needing to be impedance matched, more expensive design software capable of handling trace lengths and good simulation, a DIMM slot which means much more expensive PCB assembly costs, larger PCB to accommodate the DIMM slot, not to mention someone capable of designing a design which can handle DDR3/DDR2 speeds and whatnot. Furthermore, there is no Scrypt design out yet meant for an ASIC, which means the cost to design one are much higher than just using a plug and play SHA-256 block which most designers have been using (from what I understand).


I absolutely agree with you! I think that the price might go up because it will become more popular due to GPU miners gaining interest in it. I am not sure if arbitrage drives the cost up of the item which would replace currently used FIAT as a thing to transmit value between exchanges, maybe yes maybe no. Though, currently what we see is that the value is going up due to the probable influx of GPU miners. Once it is closer to the date MTGOX will implement litecoin, and the closer we get to when GPU miners will either shut down or move, the price will continue to rise due to only the market thinking that the increased attention it will receive will drive the price up. I personally am very unsure if the future possible increased interest will drive its price up because, well, this idea seems to be full of holes. But just in case, I have a few Litecoins saved up.

These are dividends on a stock. You are not in the world of normal behavior regarding stocks. The companies success can be displayed in three ways I know of. One is via dividends on the stock to shareholders, another is via allowing the stock to appreciate in value, and the third is the company investing in itself.

A true democracy would not be a massive improvement. There is good reason why we are based on a democratic-republic instead of pure democracy. First, consider how much of a PITA and logistical nightmare it would be to have over 200 million people vote nearly every week on laws which most are completely unfamiliar too. 
Also, consider that the majority of voters are utter idiots. They are not interested in really thinking about the implications of voting a specific individual in, hell, most are unaware of the history behind Afghanistan and how it turned into what it is today. They are lazy as well, and won't bother to consider the relationship of new laws compared to old laws.
Lastly, tyranny of the majority. The majority is not always right, even if the majority contains a few hundred million people. A small closed example would be the mechanics behind peer pressure. The majority are pushing you to do something you do not feel is right, but in the end you do it to go with the flow and avoid not fitting in. Similar mechanics exist even when talking about, like I said, hundreds of millions of people.

This is my line of reasoning in favor of this, someone please correct me where you feel I am wrong.
We want Bitcoin to rise in popularity and therefore have a larger market capitalization.
We want the Bitcoin value to rise, so that one Bitcoin may be worth $150, $200, $266, $500, and onwards.
Explaining bitcoin to many people is not a very easy task as it goes against a good bit of assumptions we have, and often times sparks a scam alert.
When someone does want to invest in Bitcoin, rarely do they know that you can buy very small amounts of Bitcoin. They do not know that you can buy 0.000001 BTC. This results in an idea that BTC is too expensive for them to buy "$156 for a Bitcoin!? That is too much!"
We agree that the reasoning for the above is due to a irrational psychological connection between 1 BTC and the value of 1 BTC, which is currently about $130. 
If we were to change to Millibitcoin or MicroBitcoin or whatever the idea is, it would make the BTC appear to be smaller, decreasing the amount of "$XX for 1 BTC is too much!" statements, resulting in more people adopting Bitcoin at a faster pace.

The main difference between Scrypt and SHA-256 is that it will take a while for ASIC's to adopt Scrypt, and due to Scrypt requiring much more memory than SHA-256, ASIC's will be much more expensive to accommodate more memory.
This will cause GPU miners who wish to still profit after difficulty skyrockets due to ASIC's to shift to LiteCoin, possibly driving Litecoins value up. Emphasis on possibly though.
The 2.5 minute blocks do help with transactions that are time sensitive. It is not an end all be all solution, but it is better than what we have now with Bitcoin.

The people who buy the mining equipment first are the ones who make a profit. The remainder either resell on ebay and make a profit or use them to "support the network". When AsicMiner ramps up their hash rate, the previous equipment becomes out dated. If I buy the 1 BTC USB Miner today, I can resell it on ebay for 100$+.
My Point was responding to your question of if AsicMiner mines using their USB sticks. I answer it and you shift away.
Anyways, yes they are over priced now, but they can price them that high since there is no competition yet. There is currently no other Asic mining device which you can get your hands on. BFL is, well, I don't think I need to explain, Avalon seems to be moving at a snails pace with their Avalon boxes, and other companies are at least a few months away. You want a miner that actually works and exists soon? AsicMiner is your only option.
If you buy it and in the end realize it is unprofitable, sell it on ebay to get back your initial investment plus some money on the side. There is a large demand for these devices, as shown by BTCGuild running out of 4000(?) USB miners within minutes, and that demand does not seem to be running down any time soon.

But the government can be changed by changing your representatives. If you wish, you can be a candidate yourself. If you do not get enough votes, then the majority clearly either does not agree with your views or does not consider your views important enough. If you wish, you can run for president under the idea of abolishing the federal reserve and going back to the gold standard, and if you get enough votes then you have to work with other elected officials (congress) to make those changes. Nothing is stopping you. Ron Paul had some of these ideas from what I remember, but he did not get elected because the majority disagreed with his ideas or considered his ideas not worth it.

What do you think Kickstarter does? You make your pledge and wait. If the minimum amount of money is pledged and the project gets enough to get started, your money gets taken and sent to the project.
If you mean that your money gets returned only if the project is successfully, I want in on what you are smoking, because that is crazy. The funds can't be held in escrow since those funds are necessary to get the project started. If the project fails then the crowd funding platform would have to take them to court for the money, which won't be possible since the people who took the money are likely bankrupt at that point. Not to mention the site would have to take a much larger fee for the possible legal fee's in terms of lawyers.
Instead, you take those people to court yourself. For example, in the USA you would be able to take them easily to small claims court or do a class action lawsuit with the other backers and assuming the people who took your money aren't bankrupt get your money back.

I am thinking that your goal shouldn't be to get clients to switch to bitcoin payments, but instead have current bitcoin useres use bitcoin. That way you can at first have a very small amount of bitcoin customers which allows for cheaper testing, and because they are current bitcoin users, chances are they are somewhat tech savy and will try to find things out by themselves first via google or forums before asking you, resulting in smaller support costs.
During that time, you can fumble around and try new ideas for implementing bitcoin into your buisness. During this time you can also work out on a very easy way for people to pay using bitcoin subscriptions while working with your current bitcoin customers. You would also likely get some brand loyalty due to the bitcoin customers being eager to get more people into bitcoin by helping you.

This is most likely referring specifically to Edward Snowden and the recent bitcoin fund for him. Aiding and Abetting a fugitive according to USA law is very illegal, which most likely everyone who donated to the fund might be able to be marked as doing so.
Still, I would love to see how they would try and prevent illicit transactions from going through with bitcoin. They might trace transactions from specific addresses, assuming no mixing services being used (blockchain.info wallet does this for you if you pay ten cents), or use a colored coin (I admit I know next to nothing about colored coins other they can be used for tracing where coins go).

This, the .com domain is for all purposes currently a US domain, and therefore operates based on American law. If the business not operating as a money transmitter then quite obviously it will be shut down by the servers seized, which means funds seized, as well as the domain being seized by the American government.
There is no way to get around this other than either registering as a money transmitter (not that hard to do honestly, no need for a lawyer army), or use a domain name which is not under US law, such as .net.

If anyone is interested, here is a bitcoin mining calculator which takes into account difficulty increases. Click novice.
Based on the calc, the ROI will be never, assuming bitcoins value remains the same. The only way that these miners will actually make any profit what so ever is to have the value of BTC to rise, they will never reach a full ROI otherwise.
If you have the option of either buying a USB miner or just buying BTC itself, buy BTC itself as you have a more liquid asset as well as less failure points (miners burning out, power out, lightning destroying everything). Also, I do not understand why these people don't just get the blades instead if they are talking about tens of thousands of dollars. It is easier to set up, more efficient, cheaper per Ghash/s, and far less space.
@_date: 2013-08-18 16:41:01
Absolutely, it is very dependent on the diff increases being at or above a certain percentage, but I feel it is extremely safe to say that the Asic floodgates have opened. The asic's themselves are easly able to be mass produced, adding terahash's per month without a sweat, and so far we only have AsicMiner and Avalon pumping out chips. Lets not forget that companies like KNCminer and a few others have their own asics, which would drive diff even higher even quicker.
So, I feel it is safe to say that for the next three or four months, the difficulty will continue to rise as it has for now (50% a month) if not be even higher, and afterwards it might begin to plateau. But, even if it does or does not plateau later, the "damage" done to miners for the first few months is enough to cause their units to barely break even in terms of effort/time and electriity.

From what I have seen, most universities offering IC design are capable of doing 130 nm, though I could be wrong.
Anyways, for doing smaller stuff, they often times use services like  who are asses for refusing to put their pricing online in a sane manner (no, I don't want to give you my address for a ballpark quote), or  which has their prices online here 
So if you want to use 28 nm similar to what Intel uses for their processors right now (Haswell, IvyBridge) it costs roughly 12,000 euro's per square mm if under 3 square mm, which I find crazy for how cheap it is.

There is bigger reason to keep the poor out because first of all, poor are usually less educated regarding investments and therefore open to more risky behavior. They likely wouldn't diversify and whatnot, resulting in a 50% crash for them being far worse than a 50% crash for someone rich. At that point you have tons of poor people now fully bankrupt, which will result in more welfare costs and whatnot, bringing the government and the economy down with it.

I originally wanted to say that thinking out of the box is different than what I was talking out, but I came to the realization that, well, extremism may be very closely tied with thinking outside of the box, but I do not feel comfortable saying that they are the same.
From what I have seen, arguments regarding bitcoin seem to often shift towards saying that banks are evil, banksters are horrific and extremely greedy people, governments will fall, credit card companies will fall, and other things which are regard as "extreme". When or if a discussion is started with them, very often times the information that is used as fuel for their arguments are either flat out wrong or severely biased, often times due to a lack of understanding on their part of the current economic systems which exist today.
Very fantastic and revolutionary ideas in areas such as computers are often times discussed by people on both sides who are very well informed, heck, full blown computer scientists. Here, they are often times discussed by people who can't even say what Kaynes is famous for. Instead of a rational and possibly a fascinating discussion, often times you get this weird mismash of wrong information bouncing around, tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, and a want for goverments to topple, all of which, I brand as "extreme" positions.
@_date: 2013-05-24 05:38:42
For people who want more proof this is a scam, lets throw some layman science at this and see just how much bounces back.
Lets look at the box of this Frostbit thing.
Now, we all have seen how large the heatsinks are for the 10 Ghash/s cards from asicminer, right? They are quite large, and even have fans to cool them. This machine apperntally does 100x the hash rate, so we can safely assume it gives off at least ten times the heat. To give off that heat fast enough so that the temperature does not rise to burning temperatures, you need to shift it to another medium, be it air, water, or even liquid nitrogen, faster than it is generated. On this box, we do not see any sort of radiators, heatinks, air holes, fans, or even seems for air to flow through. How on earth will they radiate heat quick enough?!
They are for some reason using liquid nitrogen somehow to cool the chips, but then you have to think, hm, well, the heat does not just dissapear, as that would defy a good bit of laws regarding physics, and more specifically, violate conservation of energy, unless of course they are using a patent pending process of turning energy into raw matter as per E=MC^2! Don't forget, that the very act of circulating liquid nitrogen is an energy intensive process, so you are injecting more energy into the loop, causing even more heat. Not to mention, it takes a very sexy compressor to change Nitrogen from gas at 1 ATM to a high enough pressure to make it turn into liquid. Such a compressor is very large, very expensive, very heavy, and uses massive amounts of energy.


This does exist actually and is not that crazy. It is used in things like (very rarely) gas masks for example. Such technology is also used in specifically situations exactly like this, when you want to pump a gas out of another mixture of gasses so you can compress that gas for either storage or to liquefy it, often in academic settings. Howe ever, it is not called a "Nano-isolating Membrane", but I sadly forgot the name and a quick google does not give me anything. Hopefully someone else can chime in and say it.


Not sure why you want to make everything thermally insulated in there, especially such a compressor. Isn't the point of this LN2 magic to help get heat out of the unit anyways? Can't do that when everything is thermally insulated.


How big is this thing?! You don't need "support loads" engineering for something the size of three cubic feet at most while weighing less than a hundred pounds, unless you are making this out of paper mache, toothpicks, straws, and tissue paper.


Again, thermally insulating a compressor at such work loads is a very sad face no no. That heat will be injected into the cooling loop and therefore increasing the temperature of your chips. There is good reason why fridges and AC's have air holes or vent seems right where the compressor is, to cool it.


And how much do you figure it costs to set up a chip fab to use exoitc materials? A normal fab capable of 110 nm costs millions upon millions of dollars, using standard materials. And these people quietly built such a fab, all by themselves, out of nowhere? If it was indeed this easy, Intel and TSMC would have been using such technology for years by now. Not to mention needing the know-how of a good bit of PHD's in material sciences and physics. We are talking stuff that if were true, would be very ground breaking and have many applications for customers who are willing to pay a pretty penny, such as the DOD and space programs, yet we do not see anything like this yet, so it probably has yet to happen.


What has Helium have to do with this? And how are they using it to rapidly cool and condense nitrogen? But here is a very key thing that shows just how little they understand what this mining business is, their use of the word processors. Never, not once, have the mining chips been called processors, anywhere, instead they are called asics, and for good reason. They are just brute forcing hashes, nothing more, nothing less. There is little to no processing involved. I personally feel that this is the dead giveaway.


I am quite sure that you need to meet a no mercury or very low mercury regulation regardless, if you want to sell it in the USA. Also, what do minerals have to do with anything? There are no minerals involves in this, anywhere.


If the nitrogen being sucked out of the air quickly part was true, then they are actually right here. Less nitrogen in the air, which currently takes up about 3/4 of all air ( which result in much more oxygen being in the area, which would result in a very dangerous situation. After all, this is how a few of the Apollo astronouts died during a test, they had an oxygen rich enviorment during testing, which resulted in a massive fire, burning them all to death or asphyxiating them. And too much oxygen as well as too little nitrogen can kill you, hence why divers always keep an eye on how much O2 and Nitrogen they have left. Too much of either one results in death.


Liquid nitrogen evaporates very quickly, but if we were to play devils advocate, they could be doing this to prevent nitrogen building in an area, therefore keeping the air breathable by someone nearby. But still, why do you have to get rid of the LN2 when moving it? What difference does it make if you are moving it or not for a closed LN2 cooling loop? Nothing. 




So they have either made a godly chip which is very reconfigurable, allowing for using both massively different Scrypt and SHA-256 algorithms, without any physical changes, or they included ASIC implimentations of both algo's seperatly on the same asic, or lastly but most likely, they are just scamming you! 
Well, this turned out much longer than expected. Ah well, hopefully I did my part in discouraging any possible purchasers from loosing their money on garbage like this, and keeping one scam less in the Bitcoin world, therefore helping keeping Bitcoins image as non scammy as possible.

For all we know, handles a good amount of money via CC and gets all those airline miles and cash back and other stuff, which would cause the CC company to actually loose money due to him, but they keep him since he is one of those who encourages others to accept his payments via CC.
Just like the argument that CC's are bad, if you know how to use them to their full potential they are by far superior to cash.

I also want to point out that his behavior during the IPO was very ass like. The contract states that he would sell a certain number of shares at 0.0005 BTC but as the price began to rise he decided to sell the remaining IPO shares at friggen 0.0008599 BTC, leading many to believe that the IPO shares were bought and the price per share was rising far more quickly than it actually was.
He tried to explain himself on bitcointalk but failed and refused to correct the violation. After a while, bitfunder forced him to recoup shareholders who bought at the higher IPO if the BTC per share goes under 0.0008 BTC but it went a smidgen above that, resulting in the end no compensation.
And that is why I put only a very little amount of money into this company which I consider to be very risky. Based on previous behavior, I feel there is great risk that he will pull another stunt in the future and won't recoup for his damages.

If you have more than 100k to invest, head on over to and for suggestions on finding a good advisor. Don't get one that is paid per trade or on a commission basis, use one that you pay the same sum regardless of what activities he or she is doing.
And for less money, indeed for an ETF. You can buy an S&amp;P500 ETF for example, which captures how the american economy changes over time. You can buy certain emerging market ETF's which capture economies in South Africa, Brazil, China (not sure why they are included), Poland, and other countries which are booming. Booming, NSA ya hear me!? There are even sector ETF's, for example technology and financial. ETF's are a way to invest into a category so to speak, and allows you to spread your risk to many companies on that category instead of just one, making it inherently less risky.
If interested, check out a broker like TD-Ameritrade and Schwab. You can set up an account there for free online, and there are no month to month fee's or anything like that. Plus, you get access to investment information you don't get normally, like Jaywalk Consensus, MarketEdge , Ford Equity Research, S&amp;P Capital IQ, TheStreet, Credit Suisse, and ResearchTeamT.

The idea that an investment only takes new funds and gives them to previous investors, with the funds not being actually used for anything, and the new investors getting more than they put in, is known as a ponzi scheme.
If someone like China had an old SS program like the USA, they would be in deep shit due to their one child policy creating a population drop of.

While it may begin to taper off, I think that it will first skyrocket when the impending "super miners" come in, like the KNC and Bitfury machines, causing the same effect in the long urn.

Hell, even if blockchain solves it coincidentally right now after it hits the front page, op should see about taking them to court somehow. Right now they will solve this specific issue and not change anything for others, but if they get fined or anything else then maybe they will be "encouraged" enough to actually handle these types of issues properly.
After all, that is FIVE HUNDRED FRIGGEN DOLLARS lost for a month due to nothing short of either incompetence behavior by blockchain.info or a software issue which was ignored. OP should take them to court for the original BTC plus some ridiculous interest for the money being gone for a month.
Edit: What is up with the downvotes?

For people who do not know. Back when DIGG was a massive website with millions of people going to it, reddit was a very small little site. Digg operated somewhat like reddit, meaning you submit a story, and someone diggs it up or down. The well digged stories would reach the front page. Digg had an issue with "power users" or people who knew each other and manipulated what stores would be put up by using their army of followers to digg their shit up. Later on Digg went under a few revisions, each worse than the before. In the end, the power users issue was never solved, they made the site biased heavly in favour of stories from companies and advertisers, and they made it look rather worse. This caused a massive digg exodus, a migration of users from digg flocking to reddit, and ever since then, digg has fallen to less than a million dollars in worth and is, well, quiet.
Also, the HD-DVD code thing happened on digg if I recall correctly. Someone put up the code in a story, it got dugg up, at the time spreading the code was somewhat illegal, so digg staff took it down. This pissed off the livid hell of the user base, so they simply spammed stories and comments with the code inside, some in clever ways. Digg staff gave up and let it be, resulting in the code spreading to other sites who had done the same.
ASCII art was very popular on there too, which was rather entertaining sometimes.
Also, here is a cool music video that was made in the prime time of digg. Brings back many memories, hah.

This is such a false and extreme statement. Nowhere does it say that he wants bitcoin! He just says that he is interested in integrating it into paypal.






The entire article is only like five mini paragraphs, how could you mangle it like this? Not to mention the headline of the article itself does not even say what your headline says, it says "eBay CEO weighs PayPal bitcoin option".
Hopefully it does get included into paypal, which would mean a vast amount of new and potential bitcoin users, which is only a good thing right now.

I made a somewhat long winded series of posts about KNCminer and if I think they are legit or not.
And for a more general idea on ASIC's and an explanation on what they do regarding mining can be found here:

Theoretically, you can have the bitcoin network operating with less than ten computers mining away, which would use less than 1 kW of power.

If you do want to actually block yourself from the website, there are a few ways to do so. One way is to edit your host file if you are on windows. That way, you can redirect any request for the dice site to specifically this reddit post. 
Another way is, if you are using a capable router, block it in the router. You can install DD-WRT or Tomato on the router allowing you to easily block sites and redirect them. It takes a bit of work but you will remember how much work it took to block yourself from it.
You can install addons to your browser, such as chrome and firefox, to block certain sites. There are even some plugins designed to help you focus when studying, which you can use to block dice.
You might be able to contact your ISP to block the specific site for you. Really depends on who gets your call and your ISP though. I do think that if you explain your situation they will do their best to help you out.
And even lastly, you can switch your DNS to opendns which has a option to block or redirect websites for you.
Also, as others have said, two grand, while it may seem a lot to you, is not really that much in the grand scheme of things. For some people who own a car, their engine may go bad, resulting in needing their entire engine block repaired, which costs a good few grand if not more. And the only reason their engine was ruined was because they hit a rock in such a specific way that it tumbled under the hood and hit some parts perfectly. Or maybe you were crossing the street and some drunk ass hit you with their car breaking your lag, resulting in large medical expenses and a few months of walking with crutches. People out there loose more than two grand over a stupid reason plenty of times throughout their life time. The difference is that they only loose a few grand, and not their entire home, family, or lives. So, my main point is that while yes, two grand may seem like a lot to you, two grand is really small. You can make two grand by working minimum wage somewhere for a few months. The best part is that you still have the financial backing of your parents.
Check out gambers anonymous for help though.

May I reccomend we use bitcoin average instead, as that takes into account the volume on other exchanges as well?

This. Changing from a fiat currency to a currency like bitcoin may or may not be better in the long run, but regardless the transation phase would be utterly catastrophic, likely plunging the rest of the planet in economic turmoil. People who had savings in 401k's and whatnot would loose everything they saved, pensions out the window, bond holders, share holders, banks, credit unions, it would be a dark time. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see some horrific shit going on like wars or civil wars during such a transition.
In the end, I would wonder, was it worth it? Was me participating in bitcoin an actually good thing, or was it a mistake?
Only time will tell. Hell, there is a chance bitcoin flops, or that there is a slow yet successful transition to bitcoin. No one knows, but it will sure as hell be fascinating to watch.

Out of curiosity, how will you handle the BTC to USD conversion? Coinbase? Bitpay? MTGOX? If you are using an exchange, then I am sure that the community would be extremely grateful if you used a less popular exchange to do the conversion, such as campbx or even bitstamp, as they would really appreciate the possible volume.

Are you guys planning on expanding to allow plugins and whatnot for various e-commerce websites? For example, possibly a Ruby on Rails gem, Magneto, Prestoshop? I would actually make a gem myself for you guys but I am still starting out a bit with RoR, and you guys can probably have it done faster and better than I can.
Heck, even an official simple little PHP thing for people selling trinkets would be pretty cool.
Edit: Wohhh!! I just saw your shopping cart plugin page! You guys are goddamn awesome!

While I do agree that the startup costs are indeed quite crazy (we are talking easily in the lower millions), I do have to say that both on the KNCMiner page, the OpenCores newsletter page, and the ORSoC page all say that the chips are on 28nm, and I firmly trust OpenCores and ORSoC.
Though, I forgot to mention this in my above post, there are some other things which make me somewhat unsure about KNCMiner. For example,
 &gt;An additional gain of 30% more hashing when the advanced algorithms provided by ORSoC are applied.
That is unusual, how would they increase the preformance, especially since we are using actual ASIC's here, not FPGA's. Though, it is possible that they are using the OPENRISC processor to handle a good portion of the organization load (I admit, I am not familiar with how the hashing is actually going on for bitcoin), and that could be where there bottleneck is currently.
They do not have a proper diagram for the design, and instead seem to be using a google sketchup model.
The website itself is not too ... nice? It seems to not be too polished, for example the one lone tab for products having one lone option for miners.
But I still stand by what I said that they do seem to be telling the truth
~~, especially once you look at their (just found this) video of the actual asic miner device running.~~
~~Though, in the video he says that the chips are being "programmed", which is unusual, but I am thinking that they are just using a really awesome and new design that I would LOVE to actually look at.~~
Edit: Mars is an FPGA unit, which explains the programming chips as well as the JTAG related situation on the monitor.

Oh dear,
While I am sure the bitcoin community thanks you for your site and efforts, I do not think that you should take such an aggressive stance. I am very doubtful that the bitcoin community has any official bitcoin business list, not to mention you are somewhat putting words into the mouths of bitcoiners, which many like myself do not like in the least bit.
I do think it is a good idea to have a central list we can look at to see who accepts bitcoin, for usabilities sake, but this list is not too transparent. We can't see if you are denying someone access to this list due to you disagreeing with their business practices, or requiring people to charge money to be in the "featured" section. If such a list was done as a wiki page, then at least we can see all the changes that happened over time, allowing the community to keep the list owners in check.

That is true, fiat and any other investment vehicle is not risk free, but it is important to note the differences.
What prevents bitcoins value from going down? Not much, just how much people are willing to buy it for.
What prevents fiat value from going down? I am going to use a USD for this example. For the USD value to drop unexpectadly, that means that the federal reserve was unable to keep its value steady. If the USD value were to suddenly drop, then that means there are bigger problems at play than the dip in value of your USD, it means that possibly the American economy is going down the toilet, which presents much more intense problems. So, the American federal reserve keeps the value from plunging, but even if it were to plunge, there would be larger problems at play.
So, you should consider transferring your wealth into USD.
Though, if I were in your position, I would put a majority of my wealth in something that is extremely stable and predictable, which I believe a USD is. Then a 1/3rd in something like Gold if you specifically want to use Gold, and then at most 1/10th in Bitcoin, with the assumption that you may loose thatn 10th of your wealth for what ever reason.
