I don't have an accurate answer to your question, unfortunately, but you do make an excellent point and I'm having trouble researching an answer convincing enough to settle the government regulation worries. I don't think anyone fully understands bitcoin as a currency right now. It thrives on collective use and like you mentioned, when governments are able to shut down exchanges and banks possibly ban cryptocurrency related transactions then it would drive down the ability to use cryptocurrency, including the price, and make it very difficult to use in the real world. Widespread adoption of cryptocurrency as a payment system in both the real world and online is essential to it thriving. It absolutely seems feasible to me that governments could make things very difficult and impossible to use like it's intended to. One point I keep thinking of is that everyone has the possiblity to make a lot of money from the growth of cryptocurrency, and governments are just as greedy, so they have an incentive to allow it to grow and make huge profits it.

If you're listening to Brian Kelly for crypto advice, you're doing it wrong.

Good. Idk why people have been so obsessed with an ETF other than to fuel their greed. Believe it or not, BTC isn't about making people rich.

That doesn't relate to the question at all. Nice try. Go practice your shilling technique some more.

Solid point. I'm trying to install a lightning node as we speak.

Most of the world still doesn't know about Bitcoin. They sure as shit don't own any. Within the past year people have started to finally talk about it openly, but comparing Bitcoin to Visa right now is hysterical. I think it's great that Lightning develops along as it scales and the world adopts it along the way. This way, we meet the need as it grows, instead of stretching its butthole as wide as it will go for a tic tac size dildo to penetrate unnoticed (adoption\-wise). It's funny to think these other cryptos are here like "we can do thousands of txs/second right now and bitcoin can't" \-\&gt; yeah and with the adoption level right now it's useless for millions of transactions per second. Governments are still trying to wrap their heads around what's going on. Bitcoin is in the best position possible at the moment imo.
