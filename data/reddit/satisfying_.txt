Yeah, I'm sure that's exactly what the FDA thinks as well. That's why they referred to it as "breakthrough therapy" and has already passed Phase 2, which is known to have the highest failure rates..

New guys? OP's account is 3 months old... Is he retarded?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:39:38
I know the feeling man.. At the time it was a smart move to sell, despite today's price. It honestly depresses the hell out of me thinking about the money I would now have if I had kept it all over the years. :/
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:43
Exactly. Everyday I have to explain to people how the price magically begins to multiply by the hundreds as soon as wealthy investors/the media start paying attention to it. We are all just riding the hype train, hoping to sell before the bubble bursts, which should be any day now.

Excuse me but do you know who you are talking to? Please apologize right now or I report you for harassment.

To the moon!
(for those who weren't around back then, dogecoin was where that phrase started from. The community was even able to crowdfund physical doge coins to be sent to the moon in 2019!

Enjoy the ban lol!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:32:53
I highly doubt anyone has been around crypto as long as me. So unless you have, please don't talk to me.

Well looks like Bitcoin has finally gone mainstream.
^^^^jk that was a year ago 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:46:39
Lol enjoy the ban
edit: holy shit im trolling, you people are too uptight lmao
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:31:18
Man, I'm really starting to regret buying stuff with the 3 Bitcoins I had last year when it was at $400...
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:39:43
I'm fucking doneee
Really should have kept that 5btc I had two years ago :/
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:50:02
They'll go down with bitcoin when it bursts, just wait :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:05:20
"Wish I didn't spend 10 BTC on the deep web in 2015"... mine
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:16:39
At this rate millennials are going to be buying bitcoin just because it's "hype".
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:31:10
I've bought some more at $1500 and $3200 during those big dips, so yeah I've atleast doubled all of it already. Still regret certain decisions that could have been 70x profit though for sure!
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:24:34
Back then no one had any idea if bitcoin would ever be accepted, most people didn't even think it would reach $1,000. There wasn't much evidence to backup whether it would be stable then either, unlike now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:53:32
Yeah the deep web marketplaces were actually what convinced me to buy my first bitcoin. One time I bought some digital item, forgot about it, then got refunded a month and a half later for the same amount of bitcoin. That bitcoin was worth $150 more though hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:08:16
I spend my time investing in other cryptos and mainly stocks lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:47:27
That sucks man, I'm always super careful when it comes to that stuff. Double check, triple check, backup whole wallet folder just in case I did fuck up, then wipe. I never move my stuff off of my USB with Tails on it, hidden in my closet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:56:03
Your husband is most likely like me, and not a big risk taker. Great for financial stability, but bad for investing in stocks and what not. No one likes the risk of possibly losing money, some a lot more than others though haha.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:14:19
ah yes back in the days of "100 bitcoin for a lb of weed" front page ads 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:20:51
What do u mean by crippling USD withdrawals?
I'm honestly considering exchanging half of my savings to Bitcoin next time it dips. If only I decided to do this when I was buying it at $90 a coin :/
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:41
People who bought at $10/btc and didn't sell everything at $100...
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:45:39
Haha yeah I know what you mean. The site isn't what it used to be though, there is barely any real hacking done on there now. I've been a member since 2011 and I only go on there for the marketplace because of the good prices.
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:46:59
$ to btc, btc to $ (with exchange fee), amazon cards (15-30% off), starbucks cards (sometimes 50% off), cheap xbox live memberships, social media services, and blackhat stuff of course (botnet slaves/spots, cracking programs, ddos, etc). 
I'm pretty sure that you can buy from the marketplace as long as you have 25 posts, which allows you to PM the vendor.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:41:13
Who ever said they were giving away free money? The fuck are you even saying at this point???
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:51:32
Not all of them. People who sell carded items usually get sales trashed on their thread or negatively repped. All the big exchange threads are legit.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:09:41
The cheapest place is probably hackforums.net, make sure you only trade with people with lots of positive trading feedback though.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:54:20
Not 30%, 10-20%. The extra 10% is accounting for the exchange cost you can charge from btc to usd. Just because you don't know how they get the cards does not mean they are obtained illegally. I know how they get them. I know multiple large shop owners and have bought from them. I know that they aren't carded because I run the number through Amazon customer support before ever attaching it to an account with my real name on it. 
Please man, just stop being a dumbass and stop replying. It's annoying as fuck having to constantly repeat myself.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:56:56
Both parties send their BTC and other currency to a trusted middleman, then middleman checks everything and completes the exchange. Usually you can charge at least 10% for someone to exchange their Paypal $ to your BTC, as an exchange fee and because of the extra privacy.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:34:51
empty claims*
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:41:48
Keep in mind that you can easily trade bitcoins on some markets for $ plus a 10-15% bonus. You can also buy Amazon gift cards for about 35% off with bitcoins as well.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:39:28
Much better purchase protection and customer support, less product though. Some vendors make their product cheaper on Hansa than Alpha because I believe Hansa charges vendors less or something.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:44:20
Show me a way to get face value for an amazon gift card please. Any gift card exchange site will take at least 15%. You need to understand that a $100 gift card does not = $100 cash. At this point I'm honestly not sure if you have a mental handicap or not so I'll try to be nice and explain what you are having trouble comprehend.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:25:45
Yeah I sometimes forget how ignorant people can be when they try to claim something but can't back it up with any facts. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:23:30
Read my other posts, never ignored it. I know how they get them and they are obtained legally. You on the other hand, don't. Right? Unless you can tell me how right now? And also tell me how they cover their tracks? Because you keep saying that, but can't tell me what they are doing because you don't know.
Come on man, tell me how they get the cards and how you know they are covering their tracks!
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:47:26
I'm willing to bet that you couldn't even tell me one other way they acquire their cards illegally, and that you are just saying this because the website has the word "hack" in it lmao.
