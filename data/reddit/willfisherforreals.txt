I get it. People are frustrated that politics seem to leave a lot to be desired. But that brush you got there is wide enough to paint a house in one stroke. 
You should check out my platform.

No. I recently did an AMA on r/politics. A great resource for in-depth answers on a lot of topics. 
Website also has a bunch of policy positions.

Oh hey! I’m the candidate the op is talking about. The world of bitcoin is a new one for me but always willing to learn new technology and incorporate it. 
Someone above mentioned transparency in how our funds are spent. Funny enough this is something I’m critically focused on.

Hey there - I’m the Congressional candidate. Thanks for these tips. FEC compliance is kind of a beast in and of itself. I was pleased there was a site that was readily “out of the box” FEC compliant as this is one of the hundreds of things I’m focused on at any given moment. Not a lot of time to set something up fully customized.
