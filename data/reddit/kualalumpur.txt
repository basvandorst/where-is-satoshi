If you do something that you don't want other to see does not mean its always bad or illegal btw, and  google will record and store what I'm searching for so they will watch me one way or the other.

That's great! do you know which Wallet should I use? I have not used bitcoin in a while so i'm kind of a noob now

Troll got owned!!

Well that's true but I mean when I was back in Malaysia I used to contact strangers and we would go to a cybercafe and they would send me the bitcoins then almost no one will be able to know that I had bought them so that's not the case when your bank knows that you have payed to get those coins so its not as private but of course its still private since Bitcoins are almost impossible to trace after you have them in your wallet.

Hahaha because I am only using Bitcoins for their privacy benefits If I'm gonna use my ID and my bank account then I might as well just use a credit card for my purchases :P

LOL I said I have not used it in a while not new. things have changed now, I have used it when it was less than 50$ I think we didn't even have wallet mobile apps at that time and Trusted sites back then were not the same sites that are trusted now that's why I felt like a noob when trying to Purchase and use it now, Child porn is not my thing tho but I had other uses for it.

Then what do you suggest as a good site and a good wallet?

I would also like to know. Thinking of setting up one here in Europe

Thank you mr.obvious. I mentioned Europe to specify that i wanted advice on setting one up here in Europe and not the somewhere else. eckwr002 did not specify his location.
