And, that was not some random member of the public, it was Ben, founder of the Dogecoin Foundation, and as I remember, there was also Jackson as well, co-creator of dogecoin. Both left after this issue. Also, this link seems to be censored there.

You are welcome. (As long as the other party accept them, which is not always the case, especially in the case of larger merchants.)

Ok, I see. Now the question is, was the submission to removed by the mods? Are the mods affiliated with moolah, and which ones?

brainwallet.org is a very irresponsible site, they were even contacted by a bitcoin dev to stop the service, but wouldn't listen.
They allows a totally unexperienced bitcoin newbie to generate address, from which their money will be instantly stolen by bots, and there is zero warning and zero documentation on the site about this danger.
