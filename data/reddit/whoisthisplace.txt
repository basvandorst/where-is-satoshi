There are literally one thousand posts about this. Search and read for an hour, post a thesis from both sides of the coin as well as what you think the fundamental value is right now - then, go over to bitcoinity.com/markets and see if it is over/under priced.
I have a hard time believing you're in an "investments class" or have anywhere near the level of sophistication to be investing anything beyond a few bucks if you're asking questions like this. I'm not trying to be a prick, but that's like going over to the seekingalpha forums (or worse, wallstreetoasis) and saying, "Hey, guys... do you think there is still value in AAPL?? Just wanting to hear some of your theses!!!"

Pretty sure that's not right - the money is definitely still yours, think of it like a consignment agreement. The entire idea behind modern banking regulation is that shareholders, i.e. Holders of equity, should be the first to be wiped out as they retain the greatest potential reward/risk.

was more cordial about it than I was, take his advice. 
I would, however, advise against doing anything until your emotions are in check. Again, I don't mean that offensively - but if you respond like that, I shudder to think about the knot in your stomach when you've bought in at $108 and it drops to $75.

"Business degree class mates" means very, VERY little regarding the quality of an investment.

Have you seen a single one of the posts put up in the last 3 hours?
They closed down trading for the day to allow the market to cool off.
