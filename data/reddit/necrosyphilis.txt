Econ student here, the issuance of debt to produce a supply of money isn't neccesarilly a bad thing, infact it's a very clever way to control the supply of money in an economy. Which is itself important, a money supply that can contract and expand in conjunction with a floating currency is a powerful tool to get out of an economic crisis. Consider Greece, they basically have a fixed currency via ECB policy imposed on them and an exchange rate they can't do anything about. The only way they can adjust is through deflation (austerity) to improve competitiveness or inflation to inflate away obligations to a competitve level. They can't do this because they can't monetize their debt away. If they had their own currency they could do this, devalue and become competitve. If you look at cases of deflation vs inflation to improve competitiveness, it's easy to see that inflation is a winner. 
Now this really leads to why bitcoin is a bad idea for your core money supply, underpinning your economy. Consider the scenario where depositors get nervous and take all their BTC out of the banks and stuff it under their mattresses. A central bank has less power to do anything because their reserves may not be enough to tackle the crisis through emergency lending. One could argue that they should have a sizeable amount of reserves of hard currency, but really the requirement of size of this means that we are taking away productive capacity out of the economy and setting it aside for a rainy day when it could be used productively. This is why a bitcoin/gold standard is undesirable. Bitcoins real value is that it's anonymous and transfers can't be stopped between parties (bar some extreme scenarios)

i literally put $195 into my account a few hours before this notice came up. pretty pissed off about this, what do you think my chances of getting my money back are?
@_date: 2012-05-24 22:38:51
There is a reason from the stand point of efficient allocation of resources. ideally we want people leaving money in the bank as that capital can then be lent out to businesses. otherwise we all loose, our economy isn't utilised to it's potential and savers don't get rewarded for investing (interest income on bank deposits, bonds etc)
@_date: 2012-03-28 02:31:03
ill probably sign up for that, do you know how close to the exchange rate they offer for transfers of AUD to USD based bank accounts?
@_date: 2011-06-12 13:26:56
No, this would never work. Even if the govt bought 99.9% of all bitcoins, you could simply subdivide the remaing coins, and the economy could live off of that.
Even say the above scenario did happen, the government would probably bankrupt itself buying up 80% of those coins.
The US govt is keeping a close eye on bitcoin and considering it's options, but this won't ever be one of the methods to take it down.

situation with bitcoin is different, when there was a gold standard you could only spend gold, not alternative currencies. Deflation was less of a problem since people had to eventually spend their gold on food, shelter etc. bitcoin doesnt have the same problem since everyone has an alternative currency to spend, that is always depreciating.

@_date: 2011-06-07 23:24:34
there are people who are doing exactly that by buying up bitcoins. How much you are willing to put into bitcoin depends on your predictions of it being deflationary. e.g. if i had a crystal ball that said bitcoins were going to be 40USD in a week and only keep going up, then would put all my money into bitcoins.

buying bullion would be your best bet rather then jewelry to reduce the spread that is lost when buying and selling. nut buying bullion is not a realistic option in her case since it would be regulated by the govt if they want to restrict the conversion of USD.

Both don't make sense. Youre saying you cant have different rates of deflation/inflation in different currencies simultaniously; and what you are saying it sounds like you can't avoid it by switching in and out of currencies which just isn't true.

way i see it, bitcoins are great for money laundering and dealing drugs. as soon as the black market adopts it more and more, you are going to see the value going up. The otherday, someone made a transfer for a few million (430,000 BTC if i recall). Thats millions, the person transferring this is doing it to evade the legal system in some way, there is no way somone is moving that kind of cash because of libertarian/anti government beliefs 
@_date: 2011-06-22 10:35:37

how so? when there was a gold standard all you could spend was gold or gold redemable notes. with bitcoin, it is a unique situation because you can enter into a deflationary currency easily from an inflationary one. 
This isnt compareable to buying other forex currencies because they are all inflationary and the closest comparison is using gold, which isnt the same since gold doesnt have the properties that bitcoin has as a currency i.e. easier to enter and exit the market, easy to transfer and gold isn't really a currency 
@_date: 2011-06-08 01:32:06
this would only make sense if both currencies had the same rate of deflation/inflation, all other things being equal. This is not the case with BTC/USD since the money supply of USD increases over time are much greater then BTC hence USD will inflate relative to BTC over time.
take for example buying $100USD of zimbabwe dollars. do you think you will have the same purchasing power if you convert back into USD in a few months time?
@_date: 2011-09-10 06:54:13
no, it is a deflationary currency, inflation is trending down given that 50btc per 10 min is constant, but the supply only ever grows i.e. by 50btc each 10 minute block; so relatively speaking, inflation is always trending down. eventually inflation will be 0. Not to mention, the supply of bitcoins will always be fixed against an economy that grows in value. for BTC to accomodate this, each BTC must be worth more given an increase in the amount of goods and services available, all things being equal unless we had an unusual set of circumstances either:
a) growth is paired equally with productivity gains
b) the economy doenst grow or shrinks
It's also worth mentioning that the only reason inflation was introduced like this was as a way to seed wealth in the economy for the work that the miners perform.

the computing power of bitcoin mining is being devoted to very dumb processing. It is not in any way contributing towards a pooled AI or some other improved AI technology. Pooled computing isn't anything new either, Folding and seti have come before bitcoin.

In your case, each key is based on someones DNA, so they are rewarded for nothing other then existing, why does someone deserve to have something for nothing? At least with bitcoin mining you are rewarded for work. Early adopters are rewarded more so then late adopters, but they are rewarded for having faith in the system earlier then others. And in fact i would say this is how many other technological booms came about. Early adopters took the gamble and were rewarded.

foolish has nothing to do with it, heres how an attack could play out
you visit a popular site that an attacker has compromised via an xxs attack, injecting his own 0 day browser exploit. you run this without knowing it, which inserts a trogan on your pc. This attack is quite common and it's how google was hacked last year.
you could run noscript to mitigate the chance of this attack. But my point is, security holes come from everywhere and security measures need to be thought of in a defense in depth manner. there is no true security, just relative levels of security.

im not sold on mining namecoin to make money. Ultimately the value of namecoin is what you would pay for a domain plus the hard to value aspect that authorities can't take down your site. Lets not forget that you can always access a site via it's IP you don't need a DNS service for a site to be up.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:21:05
It's always possible that this was a hack, but the simple explanation here is probably the right one. Someone was most likely just trying to sell all their BTC in one go.
For someone to drive the price down to create instability you would need to use naked shorts, not sure if those instruments are available for bitcoin trading
@_date: 2011-07-19 20:23:28
it would fall in value, when you have a systemic crisis where liquidity gets sucked out of the system most assets go down and the money that is left goes to where it's safe (think gfc). 
BTC just doesnt have enough liquidity or market size and is too new for people to consider a safe haven yet.
@_date: 2011-05-10 21:44:07
I dont agree with his points on gold 
but my main concern with bitcoin is in point 3. if one single aspect of the cryptosystem is compromised, then the entire bitcoin economy could be destroyed over night.
@_date: 2011-05-22 09:09:12


This can't be done, the value of the coin is determined by supply and demand
I think a better idea is controlled inflation which would be easy to implement in the economy, say by 3% every year.
The deflationary impacts are very speculative, we can't be sure it won't cause hording because there hasnt been a situation like bit coin where the supply is truely finite. Even with gold, you could just mine it and find more.
@_date: 2011-06-10 23:08:00
the way i see it, if bitcoin overcomes its hurdles, mainly the government and wider adoption, then we will see $1000 bit coins in the next few years. selling out of the bull market and buying back in when it dips is a great way to lose money on the way up. 
if you believe bitcoin will stand up to its hurdles, then use the dips to buy more.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:25:07
it's not the same thing since most people would use their dollars to buy the computer and keep their bitcoins. The dollar is inflationary and losing value while bit coin is deflationary. It makes sense to horde your bitcoins for this reason.
@_date: 2011-06-23 09:23:36
the currency and the way it works are sound, it's the stuff around it that sucks. It will get better.
I think designing/implementing an exchange that trades bitcoins securely is probably one of the most difficult things you can do on the web. These things will keep happening, but less and less over time as the bitcoin infrastructure matures.
that being said, bitcoin can't exist unless it does something other currencies can't do, and it can. It's going to get bigger.

ok my order has just gone through, it took over 24 hours to go through, not sure what went wrong. i confirmed my reference numbers were ok. So it looks like they failed ot meet the SLA on their end.
The rates with them are excellent, though they failed to deliver on their SLA as my references were all correct. So ill probably use them again, but be more cautious on how mcuh i put in at a time. I was burned when cryptoxchange basically shut up and stole my money so im cautious with these new places

same here, the BTC has gone up a lot today as well, even if the money comes through now im already out on btc :(
i was scammed back when cryptoxchange went down, they took $400 and shut down and never responded to emails. so im always very careful with new exchanges. I hope i dont get burned this time.
looks like ill have to stick with spendbitcoins, which is anoying since they have a 10% commision which is too high.
know of any other reputable btc vendors for AUS that are more reasonable in price?

debasement would of enabled them to become more competitive, if they had a floating exchange rate based on their own economic performance the currency would devalue relative to others which would enable them to become more competitive

that sucks man, i hope it works out for you 
having a look now at localbitcoins, looks like most are fixed exchanges, but the prices seem reasonable, cheaper than spendbitcoins at least for some of the people on there 
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:53:43
i think i made a bit of a fuss with this social media post, so perhaps i got special treatment. it seems a bit unlikely also that NAB is the problem since they would be serving customers who have much higher transaction volumes. Either way, their helpdesk and service SLAs all failed. so i would be careful using them in the future. 
As you said, there should be a disclaimer, though i suspect that the real issue here is that their are problems on their end meeting their SLA.
