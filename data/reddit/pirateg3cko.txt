Nah man. I hope for his sake he profited. Then he's as guilty as any of us but we don't know what he reports in taxes and it's utterly useless to appreciate. But he made a platform. He didn't make anybody use it as currency and he certainly make us exchange or deal it.

Plenty of startups launch either without a monetization strategy or with one in mind for a later stage. Venture capitalists often invest on a product's potential with a focus on growth and user acquisition, then monetize after those users are there.
Free services get users for new products. Theoretically, the late stage investors may even know more about how to monetize the concept.
Facebook and Google are both examples of this. Focused on growth then on monetization. Sometimes ads are enough if you have the users.

Dear God, I hope that wasn't actually literal.

The prosection largely came down on his *attempted* assassinations and basically mass drug dealing.
I agree this dude was punished way excessively, but crypto fans really like to sugar coat this dude when he's still a criminal. One we have to thank in large part for the current value of Bitcoin, though. 
But yeah he was definitely made an example of for creating an anonymous crypto drug market in SF startup form.

Honestly, I can't imagine she gives a shit if she's not actively paid to. Conspiracies often end where involved capitalist motivations do. 
Still totally wouldn't use coinbase if I were in Ulbricht's camp, however.
