Cool! Do you offer any discount for paying with BTC?

As others have said, it doesn't take much to add it as an option. By adding it to the store you help promote bitcoin. You may have better luck with motorcyle and aircraft parts.  I'm still waiting for our first bitcoin sale; I don't think that the BTC economy includes our targeted customers yet. However any current customers that read our store blog will learn about it and may be interested.

Thanks. Coinmap is so much prettier though! Gotta open a storefront in my garage :p

Your customers probably don't hang out on r/bitcoin so you won't get too many excited people upvoting you
I'm a huge proponent of bitcoin. We integrated bitcoin payyment processing into our store a while ago. I tell everyone I can that we take bitcoin. We're a part of Bitcoin Black Friday this year. But the truth is we haven't had a single sale via bitcoin. It just isn't mainstream enough to include our customer's demographic unfortunately.
 I'm still opptimistic and I await the day when a btc holding wine lover needs a new pair of hand blown crystal wine glasses.

"6 days to air" was amazing, but makes me feel exhausted every time I think about it. Cranking out an animated show in 6 days, with most of the time spent brainstorming with the writers was nerve wracking. All the animators sleeping at their desks just waiting to get the green light. It allows them to do commentary on current events, but man you'd think they'd start the season with a few already in the can so they could work at a more leisurely pace

You can buy wonderful home decor or beautiful hand blown crystal wine glasses from some merchants too! ;)

I really like this map, but I feel like it only works for brick and mortar companies. As an eComm merchant putting the location of my home office or servers seems a little odd since anyone going to these locations would not find a store. Should I just skip adding my business to this map or is there a place I could add it that would make sense?

That's one way to spend your paper wallet.

Congratulations on your first bitcoin sale (and your engagement)
The [Milano red wine glasses]( are our biggest seller - and my wife loves her set ;)

Those are some nice fedoras! I had no idea Reddit didn't like them. How could anyone not like fedoras?
