Yep. You can sell them and it won't affect your bitcoin holdings at all. Personally, first chance coinbase let me I sold all the BCH and put the money straight into BTC.

Fantastic. I remember when you first posted this.
Have you pulled the BCH out or just letting that sit just like the BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:30:35
I will pay all fees involved

Totally worth framing!

As a man, I accept that diamond engagement rings are a scam and in general, a waste of money. I'll still want to buy my future wife one.

He doesn't just want to sell you a product. He wants to build a relationship with you.

With all the computational power put into mining bitcoins and altcoins, if the entire network switched to cracking the encryption of a wallet theoretically how long would it take?

I have that tidbit of code saved as a bookmark. It can show revised (and deleted) posts occasionally. Wasn't working for a while, glad its working now.

He reminds me of pretty much anyone I've ever met involved in multilevel marketing.
He doesn't want to sell you a product, he wants to be your friend. He wants to build a relationship with you. Then take you for all the money you have, seamlessly telling you that you'll be happier as he fucks you in the ass. Roughly. And dry.

Once you get the hardware, just pass it along to the next sucker. When I sold my USB block eruptors I was surprised at the price people paid for them. At the difficulty bitcoins were at I was making pennies a day, but I still was able to get $90 for them.

Uh uh uh. You didn't say the magic word.

God damn that is a lot of corporate buzzwords that meant jack shit.

Who or what would be the instigator? The initial investment to build such a vehicle? Wouldn't they have claim over it?

Asics came out for other cryptocurrency now. Not just bitcoin.

There is a difference in the way retail CDs and home burned CDs work. One being a physical process to create the data and the other a chemical process.
But, all that being said, WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM!

As far as I'm aware, coin base held the private keys and collected identifying information one opening an account. They made it easy to buy using a bank account or credit card.
The US Gov't can order a company to provide any data it has access to. As the company had transaction data, identifying information, and private (and public) keys related to each and every account, they were required to consent and provide it.
Bitcoin CAN be completely anonymous, as cash can be, but requires you to use it in a particular way to achieve that effect. Every transaction is logged and publicly available. The individual wallets however are not tied to any person with personal info if you create them yourself. No IP address is stored, just a private/public key combo. However if you create one with a company they might require info so when you login to their services they know which of the wallets under their care you are allowed to use.
Now, one of the best things about Bitcoin is the more they are used, the more anonymous they become. Incoming and outgoing transactions obfuscate the data. If it goes through several accounts as the same amount, or through many accounts and then back to a single account it's easily followed. But if you buy some here, buy that service, have someone buy something from you, buy some more. Sell some. Buy/sell goods for Bitcoin and use different wallets for each now you'll have more than whatever amount you need in any of your wallets. Payments for hosting or other issues are no longer all related to any one account. They don't know if the person that received half a coin from address x is the person that bought 2 coins on address y. It's all a means of money laundering, and sadly there is overhead in it. You'll end up spending more bitcoins this way, but you'll have better security. Especially if you start having transactions with other accounts that have large numbers of transactions.
It isn't as easy as people make it out to be. Sure, meet up to buy some coins for cash. Don't share any personal information. Don't use a traceable IP to arrange it and you'll have some pretty good anonymity, but eventually unless you launder that money they'll at least have a locality that you can be traced to.

Fair enough, but as far as I'm aware very few registrars verify info. It could all be falsified.

Does Amazon take gift cards for registering on AWS? Does ICANN have any regulations on payment? If there is a means to purchase gift codes on godaddy or any other registrar then it would be reasonable enough to be able to purchase those with Bitcoin.

If you still have your coins, you haven't made a dime until you sell.
But still, fuck the IRS.

If you're still around, I wouldn't mind giving this a go.

heh. I have a few block eruptors I got free to play with. I'm jelly.
