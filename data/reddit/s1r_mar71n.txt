Why do we have until MAY to get the new GUI-Wallet, thats like 5 years in crypto :|

I used bread wallet (IOS APP), and there is no option to rebroadcast (its buggy somehow I think). Thats why I am asking this, because I am lazy to fix the bug :D
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:21:30
oh thats very kind of you! May I ask how much that was? Because I looked at that a while ago, and the service told me to pay 50$
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:41:16
The bot is just set up to filter all the altcoin symbols, but yeah, in my case here rather ridic 
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:59:39
okay. thanks again
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:39:52
Your response doesn't really answer my question.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:36:28
Wow thanks a lot &lt;3
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:43:08
and just out of curiosity of how this works: You paid this to some miningpool, and this one prioritizes it when it finds the next block?
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:13:41
Last year i read from somebody who bought in at the ath of 3k, when it crashed down to 2k the next day (around july / august). 
In half a year from now, i‘ll tell the next ah buyer about your story and how it turned out to be fine :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:08:10
what is this link behind this post? I'm getting redirected to some untrusted httpscertificate using site
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:29:57
and just out of curiosity: how much does that cost? because when I checked, the site wanted like 50$, and it could also be a scam afterall
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:40:24
okay, good to know :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:28:31
thats also a historical thing, the first meme became actually president!

THats a goldfind right there, thanks for confirming.
This guy is the most pathetic fuck that I've had to read / hear about in a while. How pathetic is it to brag with who you are and what you own, I'm sure he got bullied a lot in school
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:55
you can put NEO into the ledger aswell
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:21:34
oh thank you a lot :)
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:46:14
About keypairs: can‘t a quantum computer just brute force through all keypairs (there is a finite number), and compare them with wallets that contain lets say &gt;1 btc? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:34:33
If you really believe what you believe, you should not be bothered by what he / anybody says. 
Just relax and let it play out. 
Do you think that it had any influence to the current state of the internet what people were saying about it 20 years ago? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:09:35
that means that 0,0001฿ is 1$ now. I hope that we gonna squeeze in a few more zeros :)

I am aware of that because I am a creditor. It is just interesting (imo), because this was the biggest crysis in crypto so far, and now finally it looks like something will come to an end. 
Also everybody who likes to speculate should understand that this had some influence on the price.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:47:05
There is some hope for you. If we get into civil rehabilitation we might see another period where ppl can file claims
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:08:30
This is the relevant part: 
Type of cryptocurrencies Quantity sold Amount paid in the bankrupt
trustee’s account
BTC 35,841.00701BTC for JPY 38,231,389,537.
That is an average of about 10k$ / btc 
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:39:51
I don‘t know too much about that. There is a lot of conspiracy and speculation around that topic
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:54:10
Its gonna be used to cover ridiculous legal fees and lawsuits and stuff aswell. 
The only fair solution is to distribute btc imo
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:32:35
Mtgox was the biggest exchange back in 2014. Back then there was pretty much all the trading on this exchange (I am speaking about 80% of all the volume). 
The exchange had an issue in their code. That allowed it that somebody was able to steal over a long time. This hacker was able to steal 3/4 of the btc (600k / 800k). At some point the exchange was shut down (still in 2014, when the big crash happened), and eversince there is a lawsuit going on about the remaining 200k btc (for over 4 years now).

to pay out creditors and other outstanding fees I assume

Scroll down a bit in the link, there is the english translation
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:22:25
15 mil volume is mostly from bots and from ppl trading. That 35k were just taken out. 
Not sure how big the impact was, but it had some impact for sure
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:55:07
Scroll down a little, there is an english version aswell. 
The trustee sold them, and those are just out of the 200k btc that were in a coldwallet
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:59:18
they sold 35k bch aswell, i just don't mention bch because they don't deserve any attention.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:52:57
People were forced into getting their btc claim converted to fiat, thats the problem
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:10:53
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:41:35
I really hope that this won‘t be the final result. There must be some sort of justice afterall...
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:29:13
Didn‘t you see the pronto-pattern in the most recent TA? No reason to worry...
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:48:52
if you want to program, it surely is a good choice. But after beeing almost done with uni, I'd say the best thing to do is to just learn it on your own. sure, it requires strong motivation and an even stronger mindset, but uni teaches so much useless stuff aswell, and is very slow.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:04:28
computer science. I'm building it in ethereum, but I fucked myself by picking that shit. Is like 10x more work than the other projects. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:06:30
are you 50+ aswell? I doubt that 69 from your name is the year of birth :D
however I was rather talking about the older ones, but yeah. looks like i was wrong anyways, sorry for that. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:48:40
Two friends got into crypto a few months ago and both slipped over bch in the beginning because of not doing too much research and because of the well placed traps. 
I had to spend quite some time to tell them the difference.
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:34:27
if your claim got accepted, you are good to go. If not, you need to follow news over @ because people there should tell you if there is another chance to file claims.

We are higher than 8 weeks ago

Way worse. It put the entire cryptospace in such a bad light. So many people gave up and we have seen the longest bear market of all the times. I ended up selling some btc at 200€ / coin after that because it crushed me aswell 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:37:17
No idea
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:08:24
no idea. I assume that btc would be much easier. However the 35k btc sold are pretty much enough to cover all fiat claims, so that means 165k would remain (+ potentailly found BTC) in the hands of shareholders
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:05:41
bitconnect. I can't name altcoins in the topic, otherwise the post would get removed
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:20:38
I did not because I don't know yet if that is even how it works
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:23:02
I would rather say that it would have crashed more.

Thank you a lot kind sir, thats another puzzle piece filled out :)
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:20:10
My idea has nothing to do with mempool. Rather with the idea that every single address with any balance &gt; 0 has to be stored in some way in the ram of all nodes (atleast that is how I think it works), so pretty much every single newly created account takes up some additional space in every nodes ram.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:58:42
Op is asking once per store. If many people did that, it would make people more aware of the potential demand. 
There is no way that the store and whoever is in contact with you is annoyed by that. He also can‘t possibly know if OP knows the answer to the question or not. 
This is just feedback to the store afterall, and feedback is always appreciated by reasonable people. 
Would you prefer to get no feedback and not satisfy your customers needs over getting feedback? I would take feedback all the time, it helps a lot actually 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:40:03
Are you aware that there is smaller businesses aswell? Very often cashiers are close or somewhat close to the manager. Good managers ask for feedback aswell. 
But it is pointless to try to convince you anyways, and if your mind doesn‘t allow you the slightest reconsideration, then you are an idiot anyways.

I still struggle to see how LN solves anything. Afterall you still have to open&amp;close a channel. And if btc gets adopted like we want, every user could open/ close a channel once every few days / weeks.
