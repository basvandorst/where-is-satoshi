What's your native language, may i help

It's only a website, and you have to connect to pro.coinbase with your same coinbase email. You have to add a second ID document

You have this option, and if you are new (in crypto or/and trading) and already using coinbase it's the easier for you. But you have other exchanges like bitstamp, kraken, bitfinex, bitmex who accept fiat too. And sorry for my level in english ;)

Excat, just one more document. Free transfert betwin your coinbase account (FIAT and crypto) and your coinbase pro account, but it's 2 different wallets. So if your funds are on coinbase pro you can't see them on your coinbase app. But you can create an API and use portfolio application to follow your money ( like BitUniverse, Delta etc etc)

FIAT is money like USD, EUR, GBP. It's money you can send directly from your bank account. In the crypto world an edchange who want to have a pair BTC/USD for exemple need to have a contract with a bank.
That's why a lot of exchange use only crypto (like binance) like stable coin : USDT, USDC, TUSD who normaly cost 1 for 1 usd.
For exemple you can't send back your usdc to your bank account

You can use bituniverse with coinbase pro api, it's a portfolio where you can check your account and make trade (but can't make stop limit orders)

Yes, its 2 different wallets and no app for coinbase pro so you have to use your browser to make a trade
