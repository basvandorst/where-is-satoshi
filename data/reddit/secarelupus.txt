In response to your E: example, your suggestion doesn't hold up. If you outright ask if they've raped a young child, they refuse to answer, and you assume guilt, _then_ you would be making a good comparison to what they're suggesting.
By implying that not answering a question that hasn't been asked implies guilt, you're taking it a step further, into straw man territory.
I'm not saying that your point is wrong, only that this particular example is fallacious. As a side note, as pointed out above, the reason a refusal to respond was being considered at all is because NSLs have gag orders in them, preventing a reference to any received NSL.

If I had a guess, it's not for lauding charity, but for implying that the thing people on this sub are interested in isn't as worthwhile as charity. Regardless of worth to the individual owner or society, it's sort of an irrelevant argument, similar to if I said that Reddit is a waste of time we could be donating to soup kitchens, or the like. It might be true, but you're not going to make any friends telling people that on Reddit.

Better way of looking at it: By creating a currency that is mined by doing complex mathematical computations, we're incentivizing people to build computers that are particularly good at this sort of thing, and once the utility of miners has started to wane, all those extra computers could potentially be pointed at the protein-folding and whatnot.

I don't know one way or the other. Don't know a damn thing about these fancy new miners. I was just giving a justifiable layman's excuse to the person making the obviously fallacious argument.
