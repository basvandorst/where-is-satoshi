My lifelong dream is that one day PayPal will accept Bitcoin as a currency.

I can't make an account on the TransCash website, everything on that site seems pretty broken. Whenever I click a link to login, it just redirects me back to the homepage.
Note: When I said none of the "Get card" links worked, I was talking about the TransCash site, not the Bitcoin Card site.

Well I'm going to be taking the plunge too, and we'll never know until October hits which is when they start mining. I hope you didn't get a refund yet because I'm genuinely curious how this is all going to work out.

Congratulations on your first comment, Mr. Redditor For 28 Minutes.

Sounds a little complex, but not complex enough to stop me! Thanks for all the help. ~~I'll get back to you in a few months' time!~~
EDIT: It seems like none of the "Get card" links on that website work. :(

This looks great! Thanks for showing me this, I hope this turns out to be what I'm looking for. I promise you that if this fits my needs, I'll buy you Reddit Gold (using Bitcoins of course)!
Only one question though, is this USD? Because that's what I really need here, I should've mentioned that in the OP. I've edited it to reflect that.

I've never heard of Moneypak before you mentioned it, I'll go look into it. Thanks!

I'm disappointed that ArchaiosFiniks never responded.

Well that would be lovely if I could figure out how to get a TransCash card. The website seems really broken. :(
@_date: 2013-09-09 07:11:51
Hmm, I can't seem to find anything on that page that says anything about Bitcoins. :(
Oh and I need one in USD and this is EUR, I forgot to mention that. I'll go edit the OP so it says that. Sorry. \^_\^;

Haven't bought it yet, I'm having credit card verification issues.
@_date: 2013-09-10 05:12:21
Yeah I did some preliminary searching and found that post. I think I'm going to be taking the plunge, and pay with a credit card. Worst comes to worst, I can call up my credit card company and report it as a scam.

I just called up TransCash Customer Service and it turns out they're not accepting applications for cards at the time and will be in two months (the end of October).
Well then, if I can't get a Bitcoin Card OR a TransCash card I guess I'm out of luck at the moment. I will wait the two months out and I will get a TransCash card, then buy some coupons for it from Bitcoin Card. I'll get back to you in about 2-3 months and let you know how it goes, and if everything goes smoothly I'll give you that Reddit Gold I promised. :D
