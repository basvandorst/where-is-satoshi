James Altucher has some good points:
Here are his 10 predictions for cryptocurrencies:
At least one country's currency is likely to fail soon — likely Argentina or Venezuela. This will lead to mass adoption of bitcoin among that populace. That will in turn lead to bitcoin rising by more than $50,000 when it happens.
Mainstream banks will accept bitcoin, and will start offering storage and software access. They will also create cryptocurrency derivatives — as the CME is about to start doing.
Despite the optimism, there will be a massive wipeout, and 95 percent of the alt-coins out there will go away — just like the dot-com bust. The surviving coins will go up a ton. This will happen within next four-six months.
The U.S. government will secretly start accumulating one of the smaller cryptocurrencies to make it easier for gray-area transactions with other countries. This has already started happening but will really start to ramp up in 2018.
China will invest heavily in another cryptocurrency, but probably not bitcoin. China will want to have a cryptocurrency that is competitive with bitcoin, but under its centralized control. This will, in general, provide legitimacy to all cryptocurrencies.
One big problem with cryptocurrencies now is their volatility. At least one — basecoin — will likely dramatically reduce that in 2018.
More companies will pay freelancers with crypto, which will lead to calls for tax reform. There will need to be greater regressive sales taxes, which will ultimately require government cuts and eventually less power for national governments. This is a long-term prediction.
In the same way the internet changed the monopolistic phone industry, crypto will change the monopolization of government-backed money.
A new government organization will be created to analyze regulation on cryptocurrencies. This will, ironically, lead to a huge upswing in bitcoin and coins that provide actual utility.
Thousands of crypto companies will be created and go public, but only a few will be massive successes.

Experts don't exist. As we exist on reddit so does he in a chair.  There are no experts. no one knows! However it is interesting to see how the tariffs with china play out.  And if china tries to devalue its yuan.

How Coinbase goes all out on security
Coinbase is so secure it can’t even hack itself.
By Ben MunsterCryptocurrencies
Knock on wood: Coinbase is the only exchange yet to suffer a breach.
CEO Brian Armstrong revealed a secret to its success to Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna at Consensus this morning: it hires spies, unbeknownst to most of the staff, who attempt to infiltrate the exchange’s offices and compromise the network.
“We hire third-party firms to try and break into it,” he explained. “They pose as candidates applying to work at Coinbase. Typically, only the head of security and me know that it’s a drill.
But the person will come in, and apply for a job, and try and get into the office, and try to break into our systems.”

Any luck? “They might breach one or two” layers of security, Armstrong said. But better them than, say, the hacker that stole $40 million from Binance. Or the hacker that stole $450 million from Mt. Gox. Or the hacker that stole $16 million from Cryptopia.
Armstrong said that customers’ funds are stored in a geographically distributed database and that the exchange is building the “generation four” of its cold-storage system—wallets that holds customers keys offline—which is rebooted every 18 months.
That’s a far cry from $190 million in a dead man’s wallet.
