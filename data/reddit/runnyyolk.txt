To anyone else reading this thread - CEX.io replied to me on another thread saying that they're processing my issue, but that they're basically swamped with issues so it'll take a while. Since I've been so vocal in complaining about cex.io, it's only fair that I relay the good bits as well. I'll update this thread when my issue has been resolved.

Lucky for you! I'm still waiting for support to get back to me. They keep saying on my Reddit posts 'we're on it!', but nothing actually happens.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:32:03
25 days later and there's still no movement on my support ticket. Please can you look into it? It's all well and good saying things in public, but you actually have to address people's issues if you want to maintain your reputations.

25 days and still nothing... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:07:28
Yup!  - check the build folder. It's a super early version though! Right now it works with BTC/LTC/ETH to GBP/USD/AUD. It's more of a proof of concept / MVP but I'm hoping some other OSX devs might want to get involved. I think there's scope for some cool features.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:42
And yet another two days, with not a sing action or comment or message on the issue I raised on CEX.io. They keep asking for my username and ticket number on social media, saying that's they'll 'prioritise my issue' but that's obviously just to make it seem to the rest of the world that they're on top of it. They're not. Any chance of some actual progress on my issue CEX.io?

I've just signed up to localbitcoins.com after hearing many good things about it. Not sure you can use CC or not, as I haven't made any purchases yet (I guess it depends on the seller, so most likely not). Otherwise, depending on your country, Revolut bank has just rolled out Cryptocurrency support, which should be a good way to trade. They say they'll have the lowest fees. At the moment the feature is in locked beta, so you have to either pay like £7 / month for premium or get three 'friends' to sign up in order to unlock the crypto features. Check it out, 'friends': 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:12:54
Ah ok. Yeah, if they hold the private keys to the BTC address then they're the only ones who can get into the corresponding LTC address and reverse the transaction. It's definitely possible, but you'll have to hope they'll do it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:54:06
Who does the BTC address belong to?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:21:13
I've had some really bad experiences with CEX.io - and so have many many other people. If things work, then great, but if you need to contact customer support, expect to wait a looooong time, to then be told, 'oh sorry we're busy, brb'. Then wail anther looooong time to be told, 'oh sorry cnt hlp bye.' I guess in a few days they'll reply to this comment saying "Please give us your username and ticket number and we'll prioritise your issue" - happens every time I talk about them on here, but nothing ever actually gets done.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:41:57
I haven't tried it - I'm waiting for two more friends :) But I'll be sure to report back my findings once I can trade!
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:01:23
That's a good question! It should be possible to add a button to the control strip (the right hand side section of the touch bar which has brightness and volume controls) which should allow the data to be displayed even when the app is in the background. I'm now an OSX developer, so I'm not 100% sure about this. But if you think the app had potential then spread the word, and hopefully we can get some skilled OSX devs on the case. There are certainly other features I want to implement as well.

That's cool man! Awesome way to extend Diix's functionality! Nice UI too.

Also, devbitcoin is a person, not just a sub. He or she has helped out tonnes of people in the same boat. If the info on the sub helps you, or if you contact devbitcoin directly, you can find some addresses to send tips to. He / she has never asked for tips - seems to be just happy to help, but I'm sure going to show my appreciation if / when cex.io get back to me.

Revolut bank has just rolled out Cryptocurrency support, which should be a good way to change BTC to GBP (although we're all HODLING 4 lyfe, amiryte?). ATM you have to either pay for premium or get three 'friends' to sign up in order to unlock the crypto features. Check it out, 'friends':

Why can't you make an account on Coinbase? I'm UK based, and have an account with them. I've also just opened one with cex.io. I haven't used it yet, but it seems to have more features than coinbase.

No, not gone necessarily. Check out  Basically, if you have access the private keys of the BTC address then you can get them back. If the BTC address is held by a service such as an exchange, you'll have to contact them to ask for help. To make you feel better, I did the same thing with 8.3 LTC to a BTC address a few weeks back. Still waiting for CEX.IO to reverse the mistake, and they said they're on to it.

Another three days has gone by, and still not a peep about my issue. You guys spend too much time trying to save face on public forums, and not enough time actually working on peoples issues. This is a quick way to lose your customers' trust.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:56
There are definitely two sides to the coin. The problem is that people don't know what your side is because you are so incredibly slow at responding to people's issues. If people just get a wall of silence then of course they're going to think the worst and vent their frustration on social media. Do yourselves a favour; hire a bunch of people on freelancer.com, peopleperhour.com, or wherever, and get them to respond in person to people's issues. Automated messages are counter-productive; it makes users lose trust in you. But if you have a team of people who are actually responsive points of contact with your user base, then at least your users won't feel like they've been ditched. Or maybe set up a queue system for people's tickets, like 'We've got to deal with these 1000 requests first, then we'll get to yours.' And send emails out after every 100 progressions in the queue.

You can send LTC to a BTC address without errors. If the BTC wallet is on an exchange then you're at the mercy of the exchange to reverse the transaction, otherwise your LTC are in limbo. Source: me right now.

User name up111527673 / request 460934. You're going to say that nothing can be done (I sent LTC to my BTC address on CEX.io) but that's not true. You control the multisig BTC address so you can sign a refund tx. Lots of other exchanges have done this for their customers, and some have even developed recovery tools to solve this problem. That's good customer service, and helps build trust in their products.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:25:18
I also have an unresolved issue with CEX.io. It's a different problem to yours, but I'm facing the same wall of silence. It's super frustrating - I feel your pain.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:14:57
+1 So, apart from on here / Twitter, where is an effective place to make a complaint against an exchange? Like OP, I've had an issue open for too long without hearing anything back.

If I WhatsApp him, will Mr fellow Gibson tell me how long 2 months-days is / are?

It's nice to see a perfectly balanced rebuke.
