It adds value in the supply and demand way, if you want bitcoins there are now less available for people to sell you, so theoretically at least the price is higher than if there were no lost bitcoins.  You can't really accurately put a dollar amount on just much lost bitcoins have added to the value though.

Maybe its because most people don't want to post about how they lost money, so you only hear about those mostly who made money.  I'm not trying to claim I am a market genius who picked the perfect time to cash out and every move I make is right.  I've made lots of bad moves, but this one I came out on top

If I remember correctly (maybe I don't) the last halving didn't have as much of an impact as you might think.  The common argument is people know its coming so by the time it comes around its already been accounted for.  I'm not saying don't expect any change, just what I think i remember from last time.
Very vaguely like how you don't invest in pumpkins the day before Halloween, you do it weeks or months before knowing there will be an increased demand coming.

I wonder this too.  I haven't actually spent the time to hash this theory out to see if it makes sense but these are my current thoughts.  Its like an investment firm, they take your money, make you more money, and keep a percentage.  Why do investment firms do this?  Well they could just invest their own money and slowly make money, but by getting a big influx of money they can make more faster.  For mining operations this influx of cash allows them to buy equipment, equipment which helps them while you are a customer and will continue to help them even if you stop paying them money

Sometimes people do things that they think will help others without giving any economic benefit to themselves.  Not everyone, but no has said everyone has to.
For example I donate a small amount of money each month to a charity.  Not an impressive amount but its something.  I don't think I will ever benefit economically from this

In my opinion this will never work.  Do you really think John will show up on time?  Or maybe he gets there early and has to circle to block for 15 min.  And sarah will wont always be ready to leave when John gets there, and because he showed up 10 min early because you cant predict traffic perfectly now he has to circle to block for 20 min.
And John still has to put money in the parking meter anyways, which i feel the video was very disingenuous for not mentioning when it compared the 20 dollars for a garage to the 3 john is giving sarah

I opened an account at my bank under my own free will.  I can go in there any time when they are open (which i noticed what those times are because they very clearly post them when i walked in there to open my account) and take out all my money.
They limit my daily debt card withdrawal funds because if my card is stolen and the thief somehow knows my pin they will eat the loss, it only costs them a small amount, and it costs me nothing.  In the end they loss very little and im happy that they saved my money

No personal experience with brunt out fans, but from what I read it seems fairly common for fans to burn out.  So running your fans 100% will keep the card cooler and therefor probably last longer (but 65C is a good temperature anyways, you don't need to go cooler) but burn out the fan sooner.

I don't know much about Bitcoinica, but I can offer a simplistic reason how they offer money. 
If someone holds your money, much like a bank does, and can offer interest it means that somehow they are using your money to make them money, the interest in a sense is your cut of the profits (usually a small cut, but as long as they pay up its essentially free money so cant complain too much right?)
Conventional ways that they are making money off your money are 1) they are giving out loans which they collect interest on (personally I feel this is a small if any part of their strategy, but who knows) and 2) they are using deposited money to play the "bitcoin market" buying and selling bitcoins and profiting from market fluctuations. I think this is much more likely personally, but i could be very wrong.

In my opinion if they dont know what bitcoin is / have no interest in it this is a terrible idea.
Getting married takes a lot of effort in general before the marriage, during the marriage, and in the time shortly after the marriage.  
Personally If someone gave me 100 dollars worth of bitcoins (i dont know how much you want to give, if it was significantly more maybe my thoughts would be different) my thoughts would be screw this, i have too much to do to try to figure out what a bitcoin is and what i can do with it.  
So summed up my personal opinion is a marriage gift is not a good way to introduce someone to bitcoin

A slight improvement is have several subnetworks and just as many final addresses.  This will give reasonable doubt that the coins now belong to lets jsut say 5 people instead of one.
Also think about how you bounce the coins from address to address.  Lets say you start with 10BTC, and each subnetwork takes care of 2.  If these 2 start getting thrown all over the place between lets just say 100 addresses (however you choose to do it), but then all end up together again at a single address this still seems possibly fishy to anyone trying to tie you to an address.
I guess it all comes down to, when do you feel that you have created enough plausable doubt that no one can confidently say these coins belong to you.

Here's the first step.  And if bitcoin continues to grow there will be others.  Make it so you have to declare income from bitcoin separate from your governments currency.  If a business that accepts bitcoin yet does not declare any income from it that's a red flag.  The government then buys something from them (because hey maybe they didnt actually do any business in bitcoin last year) and if it isnt declared next year then they have proof.
Thats the simplest in my mind, but governments have large teams of people paid (which will be necessary because people won't pay the taxes they legally owe) to figure out how to make things more difficult for those trying to avoid taxes.  And unfortunately the bitcoin users who do pay their taxes will be caught in the crossfire

I don't know if this will help you, but ever since Kraken changed their policy to needing a picture with your face and passport and whatever to transfer to a bank I have been slowly moving funds to quadrigacx which allows me to withdraw funds by paying off my credit cards with I think a 1% fee.  So basically I just get my money out by using it to pay off my credit cards every month
quadrigacx is a Canadian company, but VISA and MasterCard  are obviously international, I'm not sure if this will help you out.
They have there own verification process, I think one is the picture and passport thing, but theres also the option where they ask you questions like what was your last address, what is the year of the car you are currently financing, not sure if this is available to international people

I don`t use coinbase so I don`t know for sure whats going on, but I assume you are using the I want BTC right now button which would mean:
The last trade that was made was for 2523.97 and if you want to buy right now the lowest person selling is selling for 2541.07 
There should also be a different way to buy where you put in what price you want to pay, but of course you may not get that price if no one else is selling at that price
It is also possible that they build they fees into the price in some way

Maybe a big company will prove me wrong, but I suspect that first small, but established businesses have to adopt it, and prove that they are using it right first.  By at least in part I mean proving they are paying the appropriate taxes.
In general people are upset about how companies are able to jump through hoops to pay very little taxes, I feel that at this point in time if say Walmart were to accept Bitcoin people would just assume they are using it to avoid taxes.  We have to remember that the majority of people do not use Bitcoins, and even less understand it, including some percentage of politicians.  I feel the best approach is gradual acceptance, not trying to get the big guys as soon as possible.

Proof of postage is not enough. As a buyer I can truthfully, or not say the item was broken on arrival, or the item i received wasn't what i bought.

this is part of the reason why we can't expect Bitcoin to be accepted by the masses just yet.  Your Bitcoins were stolen? you should of used something that 99% of the general population has never heard of before

The general answer you will get on here is you should keep them.  That is because the average person here believes that over time the price of bitcoin will continue to increase, and you shouldn't let temporary decreases in price scare you into selling.
It really comes down to what you can risk.  If the price drops more, and stays down for a month or more are you ok with that?  If you can handle that, and believe the price over time will continue to increase, then don't sell. 
Look at the price history over the last year, past trends don't guarantee future performance,  but they at least will give you an idea of how the price has moved before, and might in the future

No system is perfect.  I'm all for Bitcoin, but I also understand the importance of being fair when we go making these kinds of statements.  So here's two counter points "drunk driver takes out the power in your area? People carrying cash unaffected.  Bad weather causes a 24 hour+ power outage? people carrying cash unaffected"

to me that would be detrimental in seeing Bitcoin as a legitimate currency.  In this stage of the game for Bitcoin if people are saying "ok today ill sell you candy.....wait its not profitable now....wait its profitable again buy my candy"
I don't see this as a legitimate strategy if someone is trying to promote BItcoin.  I

This is a problem i feel.  The entry to a bitcoin accepting website is pretty high.  Most people dont know how to make a website.  Much less know how to make a website that can accept bitcoins.  Even more much less know how to accept bitcoin automatically and send automatically.  Even much less more how to do all of the above plus do it securely.
I would like to learn all of those, but I honestly don't know where to start

Many businesses operate on small profit margins.  Bitcoin often fluctuates in price more than 5% in a day.  This alone will put off a lot of businesses 
@_date: 2013-09-03 05:13:30
Will this cause tax problems?  If bitcoins are going to be accepted by government they have to believe they are getting the appropriate amount of income taxes.  And more importantly not think that are being used as a way to avoid taxes

Probably, but as long as it stays small no one really cares.  Just like how you rarely see the IRS going after 13 year olds for tax evasion for their lawn cutting "business"

I don't agree that a burial method is the best, but when your alternative is something that 99% of the population doesnt understand we can't expect 99% of the population to think BTC is a safe way to store their wealth

I was thinking the same thing, for a brief second I thought hey I could write a book a sell it here, then I remembered I hate writing.  But others could.  But I assume they want to retain some level of quality, not have one million crap books available making it impossible to find good stuff.  And to retain a level of quality they would have to review everything personally, and depending on its popularity they might end up reading reading 100 crap books for every 1 acceptable book.

i stopped mining gpu awhile ago (actually i kind of just forgot about bitcoin for awhile... i was pleasantly surprised the coins i bought and mined while it was at $20 are now worth over 100)
Anyways, i now live in an apartment that has electric heat... this winter i might as well be mining even if it is with gpu

People want it both ways, bitcoin should not be taxable but it should be seen as a legitimate form of currency.
Until the vast majority of businesses that aren't paying taxes while accepting bitcoin are willfully donating an appropriate amount of money for things such as road repair and police patrol (just to name two) I feel it should be taxed.
The current tax laws/ procedures probably aren't set up to deal with bitcoin.  But if bitcoin continues to grow they will be developed.  This will require money, and therefore taxes.  The more people try to hide income from bitcoin the more money will be spent on trying to uncover those people.  
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:09:46
Maybe one day your vision will true or at least closer.  But i think its pretty delusional right now to tell people its the same price.
Like more the vast majority of people my job pays me in government money.  And now I have to work twice as many hours to buy the same thing. 
So for the time being the vast majority of people, bitcoin enthusiasts included are going to expect prices to lower as the price of BTC increases
