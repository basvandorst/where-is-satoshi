Or alternatively, can anyone recommend for me some other non-bitcoin way to send money? Essentially, I want to do this transfer as cheaply as possible. If bitcoin isn't my best bet, what other methods of sending money might be?

Good thinking. I'll mull this over.

So to be clear,  you think that there is going to be a downward trend, rather than an upward one based on this news?

Thanks for your input. What should I pay attention to specifically? More news confirming PayPal adopting bitcoin? An upward trend in price? Just kind of trying to feel out when to know it is a good time, if ever to pull the trigger.

If PayPal full on started taking Bitcoin, hypothetically, do you think that would have a similar effect on price that the bubble you spoke of did?

Basically I would have wait for the market to fluctuate back to what it was like when I made the trade for mine to ever fill, correct? (I should note that the market has changed substantially since making this order)

Thanks for the explanation! You are much more helpful than btc-e support and the trollbox (lol). The price has really changed substantially in the past 3 days. Thus it doesn't seem like it is worth waiting for my order to fill at this point. Would you recommend that I just cancel the order and get on with things? (sadly waiting this long has caused me to miss out on a trading opportunity of about 100 dollars, but I'm willing to move on if I know there is really no hope for my order filling in a timely at all manner)
