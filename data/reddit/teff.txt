It has worked now having made careful that I changed the amount before scanning it. It may or may not be a issue with the client on my phone, though Bitcoin Wallet is a pretty solid wallet but I would have expected that Coinbase should be generating a new sig when the amount of the transaction changes.

Why would coinbase or any other processor allow a recurring debit to go out if the cost was not covered? Why wouldn't they just signal back to the company to freeze the account/service?

you might want to change the donation link. If someone is browsing with 3rd party cookies disabled or set to visited only, then the Coinbase popup closes when you try to adjust the donation amount.
Edit: Also, this is the first time I have seen anything about the book!
Edit2: I was going to donate, but I changed my mind about the amount, now the Coinbase signature been returned by the server is reported as invalid by bitcoin wallet on my phone!
Edit3: Let the Coinbase timer run out so I could scan a fresh transaction, didn't realize that it had reset the amount  to default when I scanned it, set the correct amount, rescanned, invalid sig again. You probably want to speak to Coinbase about the oddities there interface is creating.

My understanding of network fees is that they are primarily to reward those running network nodes. They don't prevent spam transactions, just deter people from making lots and lots and lots of micro micro micro transactions :p

Hi there, having a good day? Maybe a shoulder rub is in order to help wash all that tension away? Maybe a cold beer or a whiskey? A good nights rest might help you feel better?
Feeling calmer? Less confrontational?
Ok, good... 
Bitcoin is money as far as I am concerned, I wanted to make a distinction between tipping a reasonable amount including bitcoin and with bitcoin in addition to the normal reasonable tip. I also didn't want to refer only to USD since this is not something that only affects the US. Fiat is understood by most people who have been browsing for more than a few days so seemed to fit nicely and make most sense.
I am so terribly sorry my wording offended you so greatly, I will take great care to consider your feelings about the matter in the future.

tastycat is right. Honestly, in their position I wouldn't even bother entertaining you with a reply, most of their partners look to be already established businesses whereas you are asking them to support your business based on a somewhat shady looking site that is related to a volatile emerging market.
You experience in no way indicates "that bitcoin related business seems like no go nowadays." All it shows is that ukash is somewhat risk averse.
Start smaller, start local, flesh out the website, get a good reputation. Also remember that trying to use a site like ukash that is UK based and governed by UK laws is going to be difficult anyway, you will probably find you will need to set a higher standard and provide better documentation than a UK based company might have to.

If you are working enough hours, then yes minimum wage is enough, if not then you fall into a discussion about how well the benefits system is working, I only have the experience of others to tell me that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
That aside, I tip when I feel it is necessary. If someone goes beyond what I think is reasonable and I can afford too I am happy to tip and contribute not only to them having an en suite shower, but also to their happiness.

How is this in anyway anonymous? You are tying people to a postal address and asking them to send you bitcoins. This makes linking a person to a transaction trivial simply by looking at the time of the orders and comparing it with the amount of bitcoin received from a bitcoin address to yours.

What about self checkouts? (I don't know how common they are outside of uk/europe) Including a bitcoin button producing a qr code or a sending a uri via contactless terminal would be all that is needed (assuming the customer has a bitcoin wallet that works with NFC)

I have tried asking if anyone was aware of any projects specifically related to that video in  and  but didn't get a response, though in IRC been ignored is not entirely unheard of :p 
It would be nice to see available from clients, but I suspect anyone looking at it at the moment is probably trying to include it with a monetized service, so will probably not be shouting about it until it is ready.
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:10:23
If it grows popular enough, then yes. A bitcoin will be worth a significant amount more than most people will ever need. Even if only 1% of the population of europe, america, and asia combined owned an equal share of all 21 million bitcoins, it would be about 36 microbits each (approx 0.000 036 25 i think based on wikipedia pop count per continent in 2011) or 362.5 satoshi's. 
There are already plenty of bitcoins known to be lost due to wallets been destroyed and more will probably go that way in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:00:41
There is also a question of how many of their customers are not known to them? Joe blogs or Jane Doe swipes their store card with a purchase then there is a good chance they know more detail about them than the customer knows about themselves, or Jimmy Door orders online with his 6 year old account that has never had a bad or reversed payment from, why would any of them be suspect of trying a double spend?
It's less about risk avoidance, more about risk mitigation, and I can't for one minute imagine that there is a higher risk of double-spend over credit card fraud or cash forgeries for normal day to day "mart" shopping. And I can't remember ever having bought an appliance or vehicle in person over a couple of hundred pounds that has not resulted in 10 minutes or more of waiting for paper work to be filled in or their "extended warranty" spiel to be given
The only thing I see been of serious risk is if bitcoin fails at a more technical level and/or is replaced by something better, if it is replaced then the chances are the majority of changes made already for bitcoin will be similar enough not to require significant PoS changes. Things like the URI scheme used are likely to stick around for its replacements, it is just going to be back end tweaking that needs to happen.

This is all it is about, and it isn't really much different to the way other countries have acted over the last 18 months in telling exchanges to enact precautions against money laundering etc. It's just China's laws regarding RMB are more draconian than most countries laws regarding their own currencies. 
Once they have made sure they can reliably track who is paying what into and out of the chinese exchanges I would expect trading to resume proper, just with less volume initially now they can't sneak more than 3500rmb out with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-29 08:29:27
leaving it in addition to a reasonable tip though would be a good way to introduce the service industry to bitcoin, worst thing that can happen is they throw it in the bin.
Living in the UK where the service industry is less dependant on tips because of more reasonable minimum wages (not necessarily perfect though), it has never occurred to me that this could make a huge difference to servers.

already pointed out above that someone could try a doublespend,  but there are ways to mitigate this as I replied, and as pointed out here  you can monitor for double spend, or do you mean something else?
@_date: 2013-04-29 14:31:17
As I pointed out in the other [thread]( it should only be in addition to a reasonable tip in fiat at the moment. 
If you are using bctip.org and they throw it away you get your bitcoins back, but if they do use it then it means you have at least sparked some interest.

Living in the area I do, I am not used to thinking about tips as entirely necessary, but I am also aware that there are plenty of servers who will be dependant on tips, there is a stark difference between been paid an hourly minimum wage and receiving a salary equivalent to been paid minimum wage.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:36:17
I'm pretty certain an invalid signature should be detected and rejected without ever letting the transaction on the network. An empty wallet should be the same, the exception is a double spend attack, you had 1 btc, spent 1 btc, and you try to spend it again before it's confirmed as discussed before this can be mitigated.
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:19:41

this is how coinbase and bitpay do it already, if you have ever paid for humble indie bundle with bitcoin you rarely have to wait more than a few seconds for the payment to register from a third party wallet. As long as there are enough nodes active on the network it should always be almost instant.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:35:26
The point of sale or merchant processor looks for the transaction hitting the network when the user's wallet transmits it, at this point it is unconfirmed but it has been sent, at that point the only way to reverse it is with a 51% attack

It seems pretty stable to me, the only real issue is the time it takes to sync, at least on my laptop it thrashes the disk so hard that I can't do anything else and it is a huge memory hog, but the author appears to be working on this.
As far as offline of the wallet goes it seems pretty well documented and straightforward once you have an online copy of armory in sync. It also has a nice paper copy feature so you can keep a backup of an online or offline wallet.

Coloured coins could be worth more. If a satoshi gets coloured with the attribute that makes it a single share of some company, then the value of that share might increase faster than the value of the satoshi.
People are thinking of Bitcoins explicitly as a currency, but I think treating them as multipurpose tokens is more appropriate.
@_date: 2013-04-29 11:46:26
If you are not concermed about getting the bitcoins back when they expire then  is as good of a choice, you can carry them round preloaded or load them before you hand them over if you have a wallet on your mobile device.
edit: just to point out before it is mentioned, the holo security strips are not required they just make it harder for someone to get the private key without untaping it, normal tape works just as well in this situation.

but you don't have to because you are familiar with it already. We are used to handling physical goods, 1 litre bottles, 500ml bottles, 330ml cans etc. I don't know precisely how big a 25ml bottle needs to be to hold 25ml of fluid, but my experience with other bottled items means I can make a pretty good guess at it.
Physical currency is similar. Denominations make a certain amount of sense, and if you are using a foreign currency you have never used before you will struggle at first, but once you have learnt the physical size and weight of them and the association with their value, they become easier to handle and deal in.
Bitcoin is not going to have this physicality to it that help people manage size, value and cumulative amounts. Using SI isn't rocket science, but it's still a big shift in thinking for the vast majority of everyday people.
