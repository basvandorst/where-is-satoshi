It's official. This shit is no longer getting old. It's just old.

This is false and ill advised.

Yes, please temporarily crash the price

Well, this is just one data point and anecdotal, but I’ve been paying the full amount on all cards for 20 years and my credit score is 840.

There’s a difference between the interest rate a bank will pay you for saving money and the interest they will charge you for taking a loan.

Maybe you can share your crystal ball with us.

No control is false. First of all, you get an immediate “return” of whatever is your tax rate, so probably 20%+.  Then, an immediate 100% return on whatever your employer matches. Then you get to let the investment plus immediate returns compound tax free. Then you get to control exactly what it’s invested in if you roll over to something like E*TRADE. On top of that, you can loan yourself this money and pay yourself back with interest or you can just take it out at any time and pay taxes on it, which may actually be more money than if you’d just taken the money in your paycheck and put it in the bank. So calling it no control is clearly false.

Well, that does sound annoying TBH.  Also will seem lame when its not.

Yep, this is where everyone learns that no, it can't keep spiking up forever. Why everyone wants to get in at the top will always baffle me. Buy low, sell high people, not the opposite!
