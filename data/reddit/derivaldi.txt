Most likely - both.

Actually, that's a good point. In Satoshi's paper this condition is portrayed very well. As far as i understand what he was trying to achieve is to any party that gathered 51% it should be more profitable to continue mining that to attack the system. Still, having any party that _can_ attack bitcoin is really, REALLY bad.

Came here to write exactly this.

Still can't get over the fact that you're not an early adopter? That's sad...

It will be pretty funny if this story gets posted on and everyone there starts shouting "Bitcoin is a scam! don't support it!"...

Oh, someone MUST do this sooner or later... Count me in. I'm going to read the paper, then send an email asap.

Yeah, but network becomes centralized. So if NSA wants to shut down bitcoin - they can do it just by visiting GHash.io...

AFAIK, BTCguild stopped it themselves, so... This is kinda different.

Why do you need an umbrella against the snow in Japan? Or is it like rainy-snowy wheather there?
Also, TIL that Japan is absolutely clean. Look at that hydrant!

I don't think he understands what BTC is.

That looks more like Dogecoin headquarters. Hehe...

Bad idea. We have litecoin for those who prefer scrypt. No need to fork the blockchain and start a war...
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:27:01
No it did not. Neither Bitcoin nor Dogecoin were hacked. Online wallets were. Such kind of news makes general population think cryptocurrency itself is not secure.

I'm hoping there are much more people who go ahead and read the docs, without asking stupid questions... We just don't hear from them often. Eventually, it seems like everyone just ignores docs.

I prefer to think about this as revolution. Or riot. Depending on the outcome.

This proves reporters are pretty bad at math.

Sensational journalism at it's lowest.

I actually want to open cafe where i live, just for the sake of accepting bitcoin. One can create a nice community this way.

Just link FAQ. It's almost as easy as to downvote.
