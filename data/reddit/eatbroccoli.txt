Blockchain technology will be adopted by governments and financial institutions; Bitcoin isn't going to crumble any system, it will co-exist. The crypto blackswan is approaching. If we knew what it was, it wouldn't be a black swan. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:56:54
I don't think it's a scam. I think there are a lot of problems that need to be worked out; it's not even close to replacing fiat currency and its growth rate over the past 1 year is not sustainable.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:05:07
There won't be any big government bailing out bitcoin holders when the black swan arrives. Nassim's thoughts are exactly why I haven't leveraged myself into bitcoin, and will be the same reason I don't lose all my money.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:37:17
People who are buying Bitcoin are looking to get-rich-quick. You don't trust Governments and Banks... People you can talk to, see and meet?
But you'll trust some unknown developer and decentralized nodes in locations you'll never visit? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:50:45
Those are just a couple of current problems; expect a lot more bubbling up to the surface over the next few years. I think it's naive to think Bitcoin is going to "fix" the entire monetary system.

Universal truth: the human race is a ponzi

You realize that the majority of bitcoins are in the hands of the most corrupt people in the world, right? This is a medium of exchange that was—AND STILL IS—used rampantly in the black market online.
So essentially, by investing, you're propping up the millions of coins owned by people you may think are scummier than the "first world corrupt".
Other technologies that use the blockchain will solve those problems you have listed. Bitcoin isn't even close to what the 'final' solution will look like for any of those issues.

I'm not saying this particular pullback is a result of any company such as Goldman Sachs, but you may need a lesson on the history of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc.. and what they are capable of when billions of dollars are involved. 
I support the coin; however, I think it's a dark day for all commoners when these companies start "analyzing" coins. They will influence the market with their comments, regardless of what you believe.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:16:51
Pretty sure Goldman Sachs said this would drop to 1850ish (which it did), then go to 3300 (which it did, plus more). Unfortunately, since it is now becoming a rigged game, I think we'll see it back at 3000 USD.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:31:26
I believe the blockchain relies on the computing power, owned by humans, with human agendas, who can decide to team-up... just like banks, governments, and lawyers. Your "trust" is invested in people whether you invest in the stock of a company or the owner of a GPU farm. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:30:09
People still invest in the stock market despite the massive amount of market manipulation that occurs, so who knows. When enough money gets involved in coins, like it is now, the big boys will step in and rake all the Regular Joe's over the coals, just like they do in the stock market.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:18:48
edit response: Yup. Looking grim. These guys rig the market, they'll probably start rigging the coin. Short it on the way down and make money, then pump it up again. The cycle of life continues.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:45:33
All I'm really saying is that when this much money gets involved, the people who know how to rig things and profit big, will.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:51:58
Indeed, that is the nature of a Black Swan.
I'm expecting an unfavorable press release from the Chinese Gov. But it could be anything.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:57:15
Market manipulation isn't a conspiracy theory, here are two quick examples:
There are many more where that came from. But you can deny my statement all you want, scream conspiracy theory (lol), and say bitcoin/altcoin markets have happy, helping people all being friends if that makes you feel better.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:48:54
Take power away from banks, governments, and lawyers.
Hmmm.. 
Take power away from large bodies that help and protect you when in need. ---This may not be true in all countries but if you're in a 'first-world' country that doesn't seem like a good idea.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:46:21
Your comment is suggesting that you won't be keeping your money in bank or government 'care'? Good luck paying your taxes—by the way, you'll need to pay that in your government's taxable currency. Or are you planning on living on the moon with all the HODLERS by next calendar year?
We'll all be using banks for the rest of our lives. Anyone who thinks banks and governments are going to roll over for bitcoin are drinking too much kool-aid.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:36:52
Don't get me wrong, I love this bitcoin trend; however, I feel 'investors' are significantly underestimating a large drop in the near future. 
Until then, woop woop!
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:09:35
Well, the point is you seem to be confused: If you start buying things you can't afford on paper, one day, someone from the government will start asking questions. Feel free to fudge your tax forms and lie to your government ("I don't own any ICOs or Bitcoin."); see how that works out.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:23:14
Yeah, I don't have much Bitcoin either. At the end of the day, the government will always find a way to win; and that's not necessarily a bad thing—governments are supposed to be for the people and are supposed to protect their people.
Governments are broken, and despite what most people believe on this sub, investing in Bitcoin is not an even remotely close to a solution to fixing 'the system'. There will be a human revolution, shift in consciousness, when climate change truly hits home. Give it 10 - 15 years.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:14:37
Seems like when it's going down no one hopes that's right. Regardless, when the black swan arrives, I bet the tune you will be singing will be a lot different. Don't say 'no one warned me'.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:36:47
I don't watch the media. Just using my own critical thinking skills on this phenomenon. Putting my money in land instead of a string of letters and numbers. I prefer Earth to the moon. Enjoy the ride wherever it goes.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:00:07
Citizens have the power to stop their government from doing many things. So, I'm not sure how you can argue "nothing stopping any government from doing this." Here in Canada, we don't have any taxes on principal residences; sucks to be in brainwashed, Trump America, I guess.
Actually, you said Bitcoin *ownership*.  And again, if you think your government won't start cracking down on Bitcoin ownership over the next few years due to money laundering, etc... *sigh* I won't be getting any satisfaction from 'I told you so'. It'll just be what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:15:19
Oh, what's that sir, show me the receipt for that new car you bought there? Oh, can't produce? Let's conduct an audit on your 2017 - 2020 income. Ah, looks like you'll be owing us $100,000 in back taxes. Oh, can't afford that? We'll be garnishing your wages. Oh, what's that, now you do have the money? You must have a source of this money, are you money laundering? Continue... Continue... Good luck lying :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:12:03
Ah, I guess I was confused at your accusation that I said "bitcoin is stupid"—as I did no such thing. If that's what you inferred from my comment, then I'm correct in thinking you have a bias and lack the skills required to evaluate my comments correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:43:13
Well, for starters, my land is my principal residence hence my comment of paying down my mortgage. Where I come from there are no *capital gains* taxes on anyone's principal residence. Not sure how it works wherever you're from.
Secondly, you seem to be ignoring the fact that you said a tax on Bitcoin wouldn't work, and now you're trying to educate me about how it will be taxed? Do you understand how it is absurd to have a conversation with someone who denies something exists and then tries to educate you on how it works?
*Edit: added *capital gains*
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:17:06
Seems like they do a good job promoting what they want regardless of it's authenticity. I believe articles saying "Russia is going all in on bitcoin" was posted here awhile ago. If you don't think powerful organizations are manipulating the minds of young, ignorant investors, well, time for some critical thinking skills.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:20:24
Sorry you were mislead by a click-bait title and the comment I replied to is actually what happened. Lamborghini donated that car, it was not through a Vatican investment Bitcoin. Maybe you'll learn some critical thinking skills fast enough before you get scammed multiple times in your life, maybe not. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:44:25
Sound awfully defensive there. You're not worried about governments hammering this in a year or two due to money laundering? Welcome to the real world; a wake-up call for the HODL pumpers will be happening soon.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:15:45
Listen, my friend, are you still missing the point here? You say in one breath that "a tax on bitcoin ownership wouldn't work" and in the next breath now you understand you'll be taxed? I don't get your logic. Anyway, big wake-up call coming for those that think they are escaping a corrupt system.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:59:24
Yeah, there's a lot of scary pumping going on around here. Wonder how many Russian bots are actually pumping this up. Considering Russia and North Korea love this 'Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin' craze.
I think people are under the false impression that being your own bank removes your money from society's problems. Wake up guys. (Pour on the down votes and bashing, because we can't discuss the absurdity of this. Oh yeah, and Russia wouldn't be using any of their troll bots to inflate the prices of Bitcoin at all, right? lol)
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:11:31
Common sense? Willingness to look at a situation from multiple angles? Sheep don't get these concepts usually.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:12:54
IRS is treating the income or gains from the sale of a virtual currency, such as bitcoin, as a capital asset, subject to either short-term (ordinary income tax rates) or long term capital gains tax rates, if the asset is held greater than twelve months (15% or 20% tax rates based on income).
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:51:55
Lumping your money into a pool with money launderers isn't a good idea for 'saving'. I'm watching my small amount of BTC grow and love it, but am actually 'saving' through payments down on my mortgage. Not putting a dime into Bitcoin. Pending doom approaches for a lot of CryptoCurrencies in the next year or two...
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:59:34
I am not familiar with p2p prediction markets. And I think a global defense system would be amazing. If people don't start working together we are done for. I'm a big advocate for global unity, just can't get anyone to take it seriously enough.

If Bitcoin ever got mainstream enough to buy your groceries, land, or your day-to-day transactions, the government will be looking at your Bitcoin as a 'piggy bank' as well. If you think you can not pay your taxes or not pay capital gains on Bitcoin, reality is going to hit you (and all HODLers) really hard one day.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:21:45
I am doing great, thank you :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:48:54
Sounds like someone hasn't done his/her own taxes before?
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:55:54
This whole sub has degraded into bitcoin pumpers. Dangerous game kids.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:25:20
Pure delusion exists around here. A price like that would require main-stream adoption. With the current complexity of all crypto and most people just looking to make a quick buck we wont see a price like that for years (or never?).
Our current decline should be people waking up to reality.
As I have mentioned before, goldman sacs, jp morgan, GOVERNMENTS can and will retain control. If they need to they'll buy up tons of coins, slap regulations on exchanges/miners (even buy out miners/exchanges), or whatever they can do to keep control. This "war" over money everyone is preaching is missing the point of true change. If you think you're fighting an economic war by buying BTC you need to wake up. If you think you'll be rich by buying BTC, wake up - that ship has sailed. How about hard work, education, mastering a craft to succeed in life instead of buying 1 BTC and sitting on your ass thinking you're changing the world.
Further to this, mods should be censoring these meaningless opinionated PUMP posts. As stated in the Community Guidelines on the right:
Please avoid repetition — is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem.    ----- maybe they should add, "and all the pumper posts you can handle."
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:05:41
That moment when you realize it's a rigged game. And BTC starts falling.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:19:25
These posts should be banned. Pumpers telling people what to do with their money.
This information can be found in the right hand column.

when these type of guys start pumping the market, it spells disaster for the regular joe. beware the black swan

I have bitcoin, and this sub makes me sick. Main part of the reason I stopped following it and unsubscribed. I do check in from time to time to witness the delusion/greed of the sheep. Blockchain technology will win globally but that does not necessarily mean 'Bitcoin'; I am not putting any fresh money into this as well caution others about the insanity of the HODLers mentality.
