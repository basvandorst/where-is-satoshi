That's a great library. I'll add it to the blog post - thanks!

I'm the author of that first blog post (just saw a few people coming into my blog from this Reddit post). That post is based on some work I did creating a Bitcoin invoicing system. I'm not an expert but I'm happy to attempt to answer any questions about it.

The three main exchanges are CAVirtEx, Vault of Satoshi and QuadrigaCX. They all have some kind of merchant services API. 
I believe you can use BitPay in Canada. You might also consider rolling your own merchant service with pybitcointools. Here's how you could do that:

It might but it seemed pretty buggy when I tried it a couple days ago. And I don't think they have an API so it's more for people who are manually invoicing rather than e-commerce (at least for now).

Generally the creator of a work owns the copyright:  (Smart &amp; Biggar is a major Cdn IP firm). Although there are special rules for employees in Canada and the US (and many other details about how copyright law works).  
Here's a short paper from 2006 that discusses copyright, contracts and lawyers from a US perspective:  (The author of that paper is a well-known author who writes about contract drafting: 
There are also interesting issues around the ownership of documents filed with courts that have been digitized by legal publishing companies:  The same issue in the US:  
Obviously you'd want advice from a lawyer about how copyright applies to your specific circumstances in your jurisdiction.

Very little of the work that "Bitcoin lawyers" do is criminal law. Almost all of it is what's called "corporate/commercial" work (e.g. writing a contract for a client to hire another company to develop an interface for bitcoind).

It's around 60gb now and growing at a nearly linear rate. Two years ago it was around 15gb ( so expect it to be over 100gb in two years time. 
A server with enough room for today's blockchain would be $80/mo today with Digital Ocean:  On Google Cloud you could build a system to handle a node for around $10/mo:  
If you mean the cost of building your own box, assuming you get Internet for free, then you're looking at under $100 for a small computer and hard drive. A regular desktop from ten years ago can handle running a full node.

The TD agreement that's linked to in the post:
"You may use your account for personal banking needs only. If you use your account for the purpose of carrying on a business or an enterprise, we reserve the right to charge you business banking service charges and close your account."
The Canadian Bankers Association (a trade association) has some information on cheque fraud that might be helpful:  
You may also find the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (a federal agency) a useful source of information: 
On the off chance that you might think this post is legal advice: it is not. You'll need to hire a lawyer for that.

Since inception you're certainly right. Over the last couple years it's been a lot flatter. We'll have to wait and see.

There are quite a few forex businesses that also buy/sell bitcoin (through BTMs).
