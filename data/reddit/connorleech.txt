The thing with this is that banks are FDIC insured, while bitcoin exchanges are not.  Though these organization technically have a legal obligation to the people, it is in the gov't's financial best interest to do everything in their power to track down those funds, or they will be looking at a huge financial hit paying back all of the stolen funds.

For something that requires a high demand like a car rental service, you will need to be able to hit all parts of the market.  If you limit your customer base to btc users, you will not reach the demand needed to succeed in that type of environment.  Now a discount on btc users, thats a good idea.

The article was pretty weak.  A bit better in print than the digital article (why they are different I don't know), but she basically says the currency is cool, interesting in theory, but a huge PITA to actually shop with.

I am getting really tired of these articles of bitcoin's viability as a currency.
BTC is:Portable, Durable, Exists in common size, Is impossible to counterfeit 
It is therefore a currency.

Look, I enjoy being a dick just as much as the next guy, but after thorough searching, I struggled to find a site that offered custom designs for free, and was hoping someone would offer some help.
