Starting to think about the day that I kick the bucket and no one knows I own bitcoin...
My friend's life was recently taken who was in his 20s. He went to work one day and never made it home. It has made me think about all the things I need to have in place to ensure that my family and friends don't have to worry, including what happens to my bitcoin.
What have you done?
I would also be interested in what other information I leave with my BIP39 mnemonic seed / passphrase (other than instructions for a likely no-coiner). Wallet I used? Derivation path?

Can I use my 24 seed words from my ledger hardware wallet to set up another hardware wallet (not ledger) or software wallet, allowing me to still access the same private key and funds?

Agreed! I think there is more of a case that ATMs are better suited to individuals that struggle to on-ramp into bicoin due to not having a bank account. People who just want to dollar cost average, then hodl, aren't likely to use them.
I want to give a friend (no-coiner) some satoshis with the private key stored on an Opendime for xmas. I thought it would be pretty cool to buy them from an ATM that doesn't require verification (for low amounts of FIAT), sending the BTC straight to the address on the opendime. It would make for a better story, and hopefully intrigue them more about the bitcoin space. Only downside to this is that if they lose it, no back up.

Can you provide an explanation as to why?

Rumour has it that he began by showing his chart analysis to the crowd

1. Best way to generate / make  a BIP39 passphrase?
2. How long should it be?
3. What characters should it contain / not contain?
4. Any other considerations?

Why are exchanges flagging accounts that have been detected for using coinjoins? And how are exchanges able to tell if you have used a coin join service?

Couple of cons for me:
-I dont want to ever give someone my finger print. Who knows how this information is stored or how it may be abused in the future.
-I dont like that alot of the ATMs don't advertise their verification process on the internet. So until you rock up to the ATM you don't know whether you'll have to give your finger print, mobile number, ID.
Note 1:
Some ATMs do however provide their verification process via coinatmradar.com. For example I know an ATM that states-
FIAT 1 - 500 no verification.
FIAT 500 - 2000 SMS verification.
FIAT 2000 - 10000 SMS + ID verification.

I've put my best copy of the bible down my pants and will continue to take sucker punches. For I have the will that was bestowed to me by the Lord.

That's a good use case! Never thought about the bureau de exchange scinareo. However I personally cant see it getting past the store of value use case, and becoming a method of payment. Maybe one day ey?!

Thanks for the information. I'm toying with the idea of using coin joins, however I have heard that some people have had their accounts flagged by exchanges (when sending bitcoin to their account that has been run through a coin join service).
Why are exchanges flagging accouns because of coin joins? Should this be something we should worry about? Is there a way to get around this? What is a reasonable justification to provide to an exchange if they ask why you are using a coin join service?

Supposedly your fingerprint on your phone is stored locally (and it's optional if you want to use it or not).
I'm sceptical as to why any service would require biometric identification if it's currently not mandated. A single company may be using the information to track your buying and selling history on crypto ATMs, and therefore be able to justify to the authorities that their users cannot evade the authentication process (for example using multiple phone numbers). Or maybe they want to enforce fingerprinting so to deter crime, and only suck people in who are less concerned about their privacy.
Again, I'm a sceptic.
