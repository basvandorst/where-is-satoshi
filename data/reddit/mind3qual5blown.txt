If the total unknown miners exceeds a large majority of known pools, isnt it possible that a single miner could control 51% without the community knowing? Does anyone know a way to view subsets of the unknown 'slice' of the pie.

I literally like like 2 minutes from you guys! Here's some more:
- How did you initially find out about bitcoin
- Do you have plans to accept any other cryptocurrencies
- Will you be offering a discount for people using bitcoin as a payment method
- What potential do you see in bitcoin that led you to accept it in your store

Banks don't want to touch bitcoin and will not be giving out "bitcoin loans" in the foreseeable future if ever. If anything they wouldn't even consider it until the price has stabilized in which cause the large fluctuations we currently are seeing would basically be nonexistent. Pointless article because IF a "bitcoin loan" were ever given out by a bank, the price would be roughly the same when it came time to pay it back
