Extremely undervalued coin

You can check [ to get an estimate.

Check out [TabTrader]( You can connect to many exchanges via the exchange's API. Works well.
P.S - You can ignore the ICO stuff on their site. This is not needed to use the app.
Edit: formatting.

Just wondering what would happen in the case of receiving "tainted" coins after a trade? Presently in centralised exchanges, one can be relatively assured of not receiving tainted coins? Not sure how one would deal with that possibility here.

As others have pointed out, focus on looking forward. Accumulate and hodl as per your financial situation. The first time I heard about Bitcoin would have been in 2012 probably and I was living in a country in which it was impossible to buy Bitcoin then. I never ventured into mining as I didn't know enough about it. And who knows, even if I had bought/mined it then, I am not sure if I would have been able to hodl through the swings or even would have been able to store it safely through computer and HDD crashes. 
Bottom line - look forward and keep on accumulating + hodling.

Sorry for the noob question but if I run a full node, is it better to hold my bitcoins on my full node wallet as opposed to a hardware wallet like nano s?
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:27:17
Are you literally shaking? ;)

I use Kraken and if you are ok with doing a wire transfer (SEPA - free in EU), then it is quite easy to buy. I think their maker/taker fees are 0.16%/0.26%. Of course, they require KYC and verification. Overall, I would say they are quite good if you are ok with KYC and waiting upto 2 days to get your fiat in.

The trollbox has probably been the greatest side effect of crypto trading! ��

Ledger Nano S can be used with Electrum wallet. So you'll need -
*  Your full node. 
*  An Electrum/Electrumx server running with your full node. 
*  An Electrum wallet on your laptop connecting to your Electrum server. 
*  Your ledger Nano S connected to the Electrum wallet on your laptop. 
I'm using this setup where I run my full node and electrumx server on an RPi and have my Ledger Nano S connect to the Electrum wallet on my laptop that in turn connects to electrumx. So I use my own full node and electrumx server to send and receive and validate transactions.

You can use Bitstamp for buying Bitcoin. They accept SEPA deposits and have no withdrawal fees for BTC. Their trading fees are a bit high ~ 0.25% iirc. Kraken was a good option up to the point their service was extremely degraded.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:30:04
Bitstamp. Kraken was good but lately isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:06:49
One of the better mobile wallets out there for sure. And big thumbs up to their support for helping me with an issue too! Highly recommended.

Get your own fully validating or pruned node with relatively cheap, low power consuming hardware.

Lots of comments about gains being tax free in Germany if one were to "hodl" for over a year. However, this may not be true as since 2009, there exists 'Abgeltungssteuer' (withholding tax) which is flat 25% plus solidarity surcharge on the gains of your investments - even if you hodl for a year or more. So all those who are selling may want to check this once.
@_date: 2019-04-28 11:49:08
Sure, I'm happy to be proven wrong ;) 
I'm just not sure if this Abgeltungssteuer is applicable only if one were to sell within one year or even after as most of the information that I could find suggested that it was applicable even after selling after one year.

Thanks for this. I'm presently running both Bitcoin full node and an Electrumx server on my RPi without any hiccups. I guess EPS will have smaller reside resource usage than Electrumx. Will try this out soon. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:18:55
Good stuff! Bluewallet looks neat, I will try setting up my own instance of LNDHub in order to control my own keys - assuming it isn't too much of an overhead on the LND.

In the screenshot, the external peer ports connecting to you should be specified as a range - Port must be between 1024 and 65535. Your forwarded port should only be 8333.
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:05:28
So I am thinking of adding lnd to my existing Bitcoin full node on an ODroid. One question I have is regarding channel behavior during reboots or loss of internet - at times, I have to power cycle my modem to resolve some internet issues (thanks ISP!). What happens to open channels then? Are they force closed upon loss of internet to my node? Also, if my node happens to reboot, are the channels force closed? 
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:13:15
Probably this - [
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:27:28
Will probably try this out in time. So far I've got a fully validating node and an Electrumx server running smoothly on an RPi3.

Don't beat yourself up over not getting in early during 2010. What are the chances that you would have held on to your coins through Gox, the bear market or even followed best practices for storage like hardware wallets, paper wallets etc. The temptation to sell when it hit 1k for the first time and then dropped down all the way would have been compelling to many to minimize losses. Or you would have tossed out your hard drive after it crashed without having a backup. My point is that there are so many possibilities that you would not have held on to your coins even if you got in early. It is only after having lived through all this does one realize the real meaning of HODLing. So don't worry about the past, keep buying and hodling!

Just out of curiosity (as LBC is banned in my region), do you wait till the tx confirms before heading back from the meetup?

Even if I want to open port 8333, my ISP provides me IPv6 &amp;  IPv4 over DS Lite. And my modem firewall settings don't allow me to selectively open the firewall for port 8333 on IPv6 - need to recheck this though.

I run a fully validating Bitcoin core node and an Electrumx server on a Raspberry Pi 3. I then use my NanoS with Electrum wallet on my laptop that only connects to my Electrumx server.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:59:45
Well when I update Raspbian to stretch, install dependencie and electrumx, and try to launch bitcoind, I get missing libboost errors. Doesn't go away even if I install Bitcoin coffee dependencies again. Am not sure if this guide is dummy friendly which is what I probably need I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:40:19
Am following this guide to get my non-pruned RPi full node set up with an external 1TB HDD to store the blockchain. The only issue I encountered was that bitcoin-cli always tried looking for bitcoin.conf under the default .bitcoin directory and not under my mounted bitcoinData directory in spite of my following all the points in the tutorial. I finally had to use bind mount bitcoinData to .bitcoin and it seems to be working as of now. 
EDIT: Unfortunately, for some reason, bitcoind is always looking at the default data directory on the SD card inspite of providing the correct argument and having the correct entry in the config file. No idea why!

Any good sources on getting electrumx up on a Rpi full node? I tried following [this]( but still faced many issues. I want to use my hardware wallet to connect to my local electrumx on my RPi full node.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:55:40
Neat. Thanks &amp; happy holidays.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:17:51
I think providing an option to the user to set the fee makes sense. Or at least providing a range like low/med/high fees. Even Bitmex fees seem to be very high for withdrawal - their recommended minimum fee is 0.004!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:30:55
Nice and thanks. I'll try adding a lightning node alongside my BTC full node.
