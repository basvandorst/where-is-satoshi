Since all txn IDs are arranged in a binary leaf structure, the server has to provide not just the merkle root, but also the corresponding TXN IDs in the path of your TXN ID leading up to the root. Look at this article about halfway down: 
The advantage here is that as a server, you only need to send O-log(n) TXID hashes for someone to verify that their TXN is included in that block. For example 16 TXIDs 4 hashes, 64 TXIDs 6 hashes

Tough lesson to learn and I'm sorry for your loss. Manually claiming forked coins is a very dangerous and high risk process, and I would recommend everyone that isn't tech savvy enough to just trust an exchange to award you the forked coins. 
The 2nd safest thing to do is to wait for your wallet to officially support it (like the ledger nano). They will release a coin splitting app sometime later. Your forked coins will be there, you just have to be patient.
For those of you that are impatient, and if you know what you are doing, you would first transfer your coins to a new wallet just for the fork snapshot. Why? So you don't compromise your recovery seed (12/24 words) when trying to claim your forked coins. Once the snapshot is done, transfer it back to your original wallet (and to a NEW address). This way you only put at risk your forked coins and not your original. Even if you download malicious wallet software, the worst that could happen is you lose all of your BTCP.
