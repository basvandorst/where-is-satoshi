Googled "bitcoin qr code generator" today and was surprised to discover that the top linked to site is a scam:
[ is a scam site.  Their SEO is very good though, so hopefully Bitcoiners can link to [gobitcoin.io]( and other tools which seem legitimate. 
If you're looking for a legit QR code generator, [ worked just fine for me.

Thanks for creating the puzzle with the neat reward. I like a lot of the puzzle, but the second half doesn't really seem realistic to me. The anagram with the hex coordinates, I can buy that, but taking JUST the x coordinates, and then doing a base 36 conversation on them, and then doing it again in another conversation all over again to get the next message!? There are too many jumps with meaningless numbers with no clue that one is on the right track.
Also, the red, orange, and yellow dots signified nothing!?

You got it!  Now we just got to solve the rest!

You're correct that most wallets already provide this feature. However, there are many situations where people work with Bitcoin addresses where a direct Bitcoin wallet -&gt; QR-code conversion is not easily available or straightforward.
For instance, any text-based environment, where a Bitcoin address is being transferred as text. For instance, a Bitcoin address received or sent in an email, text message, or copied from paper. Also, there are many text-based tools online and command line (and even gui) applications that deal with Bitcoin addresses as text, but not QR-codes. Any of these would be potential use cases.
I don't expect (or want) this site to replace the already adequate wallet-based QR-code generators that you've alluded to. However, the internet seemed in need of a one-off tool that would accomplish this task, because I tracked the static Bitcoin addresses that were being used by the scam QR generator sites using a block explorer, and they were receiving Bitcoin (sometimes in large amounts) every day.

Thank you for the compliment! ��

Gobitcoin.io does indeed provide a valid QR Code. However, as noted, they do not properly validate Bech32 Bitcoin addresses, the site is littered with ads, stores cookies, obscures the code preventing security review, and is not up to developer spec on generating Bitcoin URIs.
As a result, the site is not well trusted on the internet, and over the last few months, the scam sites (which look more legitimate in appearance) periodically outrank gobitcoin.io on Google.
However, if for some reason you prefer the site to the one my team has created, by all means, link to it. My goal in creating this site was to displace the scam sites, and even though I don't particularly think gobitcoin.io is a great site, it's better than the scam sites.

Good question!  A simple test is to use the barcode generator app on your phone to verify that the address you entered is the one that is encoded in the QR-code. If those two match, then you know that the QR-code is valid. Scam sites take advantage of the many random looking characters in a Bitcoin address, and assume that you won't be paying close enough attention to the QR code they generate, substituting their own scam address in the QR code in place of yours. Hence, the address you enter is not the one they encode, and this can be easily checked using a barcode scanning app.
I'm not going to link or reference these sites specifically, because that will only help their page ranking, but there are several of them on the 1st page of results when you do a Google search for a Bitcoin QR code generator, if you want some examples of the scam sites I'm talking about. Just be careful!
Beyond checking with an app, those who understand code can look at the source code of the web page (which is laid out to be easy to read and is only a few hundred lines) and check that the code is functional and honest. Since all functionality occurs using JavaScript in the client's browser (for maximum security), there are no hidden server side tricks to be worried about. This means that you can save the webpage to your hard drive, disconnect from the internet entirely, and the code will still work!
Thank you for your compliment and your question.

You are correct that a regular QR-code generator probably won't scam you. However, there are a couple benefits to using a Bitcoin QR-code generator:
  1. If you want the "B" Bitcoin logo in the center of your QR-code, which has become a standard for commercial Bitcoin QR-codes (e.g. BitPay) and helps to remind anyone using the QR-code that it's intended for Bitcoin.
  2. If you want to use a Bitcoin URI (a commonly used standard for conducting Bitcoin transactions), looking up the developer BIP and creating a Bitcoin URI by hand is tedious and unsafe, especially where the encoding of non-ASCII characters is concerned. Using an algorithm that does all the heavy lifting for you is a better approach.
Lastly, a stronger Bitcoin depends on minimizing the number of scams for everybody, not just the technically savvy. It's not just about being smart enough to avoid the scam sites for yourself, but to extend that intelligence to help others who may not have your same technical understanding of QR-codes. The reality is that every day, people are searching for "Bitcoin QR code generators", and getting scammed. These scammers rely on the laziness of technically savvy people in the Bitcoin community to not take a stand against the scamming of less technically savvy users. Hence my friends and I built this site to serve and protect the Bitcoin newb, but without the SEO efforts of the technically savvy in the Bitcoin community, our effort will not succeed.

My friends and I built a scam-free clearly-coded javascript QR-Code Generator because of this post and this problem.  The site is [
We're looking for help promoting it to knock off the many scam bitcoin qr-code generator websites.  Here's our reddit post on the topic:

Wow, surprised to see that as well.

Thank you, I'll check it out.

Thanks for the feedback on the Craigslist ad, I updated it.
As for peeling it, it may come to that, but even if there are only a few collectors, as far as I'm aware, this is the only Casascius coin with the CASACIUS typo that is available for sale in the world right now. For such a rare item, a ~$2,500 premium on the current price doesn't seem out of reach.
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:19:06
Good to know, thanks for the info. I know the Casascius brand was the original and to my knowledge has never been compromised, so I would personally be inclined to trust an old Casascius coin over one of the newer coins (even if their security tech is more advanced) simply because I put a greater trust in Mike Caldwell then I do in those who came along afterward, but perhaps I'm in the minority.
@_date: 2019-12-30 01:56:50
Thanks, this was purchased directly from Mike Caldwell.

Yes, I received a quick refund, thank you!

Based on the condition of the coin, its rarity, and available knowledge of similar physical Bitcoin sales: $1250.
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:32:38
"Current MS65 graded 2011 'error' Casascius coins are about $975-$995 market value right now."
I'm not aware of any for sale at this price.  Where are you getting this price?  On ebay, there is only one Casascius series one coin for sale right now, and it goes for $1799: 
Do you have an offer?
@_date: 2015-09-21 05:21:34
My friend has an intact fully loaded original series Casascius bitcoin with the CASACIUS error in the hologram.  The coin is number 4098 on the official list:  with Bitcoin address 1AojUuTUgLU3gKniBgBo4YXmiq77UoznM3.
Here's a pic of the coin:

I donated, but I wish you wouldn't constrain Bitcoin donations to be used in such a confined manner. Just because I'm donating in Bitcoin, doesn't mean that I only want to read articles about Bitcoin.
