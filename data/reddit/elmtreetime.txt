Yes it's extremely complex. There are multiple contested areas. By claiming this one, the claiming country would be giving up all the others. So neither want to claim it.

I honestly can't think of many reasons to require zero conf. Most bitcoin transactions take place over the internet, so it shouldn't matter if it takes a minute or a day to confirm as long as it doesn't end up delaying shipping.

The lab isn't being accurate. What they probably mean is that the fix costs more than the phone. But if you have enough bitcoin on it, the fix could suddenly be worth it.

That article even admits that they're unbanked because they don't *want* a bank. It's not because they can't. It then goes on to find the worst bank in probably the entire country and pretend those fees are even close to standard. I opened my account with $1 and I've never paid even $0.01 of fees for absolutely anything. And this bank is available to all Americans along with 3 other fee-free ones I know of so don't pretend those ones aren't accessible.
Basically, I'm wondering what your point is. Is it that all those poor people will *suddenly* not be poor if they go from "I don't need a bank" to "I don't want a bank."? That they'll find some value in turning their last $20 for the month into a currency they can only spend on the computer that they can't afford to own?
