Well, it can be controlled. An EMP bomb that crippled every electronic device on Earth would kill the entire blockchain. Makes me wonder, does anyone print paper copies of the entire blockchain and keep it in safe deposit boxes for such eventualities?
Also,a big enough asteriod or nukes could wipe the blockchain forever. We gotta get it o a flight to mars or better yet, another galaxy.

Shouldn't. Big investors have already considered the LN. Bitcoin still has 37% of the market. That's a massive vote of confidence from investors. We would need a lot more than just a return to lower fees to see it get over 40% again. There are lots of other options bringing a lot to the table these days. No single coin merits 40% of the market.
Edit: dont forget that bitcoin is one of many that will be implementing lightning. We need to think about whay bitcoin's unique value proposition is and to what extent it merits a greater market dominance.

It could take that long to confirm but it should show up as pending almost immediately. Ask for the TxId or search the blockchain explorer using the address that he sent the coins to (the address you gave him) to see if there's a pending transaction from him.

Easy. Get a ledger nano or trezor wallet and put it in a condom. Train yourself to have complete control of your intestinal muscles. Swallow the condom. Let it get to your large intestine. Keep it trapped there for a while, don't poop it out. Soon your body will begin to absorb it, and it will become enmeshed in your abdomen. You will need surgery to remove it. That should do the trick.

Oh interesting. I had considered zebra briefly but I'm using Kowalski's alpha analysis software and the command line interface doesn't let me do robust trellis or pergola notation.

Bitcoin stuck at 9k for a while. Not sure if up or down from there.

Price when you sold it. For the second question, it depends, and im not as certain. If it was a gift, then i believe you don't have to. But if you used it to buy something that counts as a sale.

First of all, the doge app doesn't permit trading in doge. It's just a glorified price ticker.
Second, Apple's banning of other bitcoin apps that allow transactions is evidence of the fact that they would've disallowed blockchain.info's app even if it had been open / up-front about everything.

There is no "zero confirmation issue." The cost of executing a 51% attack would so massively outweigh the value of the tank of gas or snickers bar that no one would even try one. All they need is propagation of the transaction and they are practically guaranteed it is legit.
