"Bitcoin is a fraud!"
*price drops*
*Jamie buys bitcoin*
"Bitcoin is really cool"
*waits in anticipation for price to rise*
Yea, he'll probably be cashing out over the next month. Smooth move, Jamie boy

I socond the the Rogan-Antonopoulos recommendation. You can google "Ferriss Szabo" for another fantastic intro

Spoiler alert: If he's telling the truth then he definitely doesn't give a shit about people doubting him

Are candlestick charts the same as box &amp; whisker plots?

I can walk into any store today with some BTC and zero USD and walk out with groceries/goods/services.
If my bill is $100, I can convert 20 mBTC to USD on the spot with bitpay and pay like a normal customer.

But we have decentralized 3rd parties now. A smart contract can be the escrow.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:04:54
Smart contracts are computer programs that can hold money. The biggest problem is getting real-world info onto the blockchain so we can execute something like
if (partyA.didPay OR timeout) {
  releaseFunds.to(partyA)
} else {
  releaseFunds.to(partyB)
The above isn't real code but it demonstrates how simple the core escrow service is. All we need is a reliable Oracle to provide info like partyA.didPay. Oracles are mostly centralized now but decentralized ones are possible. Auger &amp; others might have already created some for common use cases like exchange rates &amp; outcomes of sports games.
Might get tricky if the info required is relatively private (ie did a wire trasfer go through?) because a decentralized Oracle would need to provide public info that anyone in the network can confirm/refute.
Yea now that I think about it, a completely decentralized exchange might not work. The bank security model is so dependent on centralization that there'll probably always be friction moving back and forth. Either banks would need to cooperate &amp; make APIs available (becoming a centralized oracle which still isn't a great solution) or the USD could adopt a more bitcoiny model ie tether which is probably the direction we're moving (depending on how the current tether drama plays out).

The BitBabbler site has a staggering amount of information on it. Kudos to the site creators, each page is like it's own little whitepaper. No price though..? Looks like they ship from Australia, idk if I'm paranoid enough to pull the trigger on that one haha

I didn't realize you could manually feed entropy into `/dev/urandom`, that's a fantastic tip! Thank you
