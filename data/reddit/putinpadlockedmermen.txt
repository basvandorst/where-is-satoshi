[I send you]( 5 cents worth of Bitcoin.

Proof? I thought because Jihan could not control BTC, he invented BCH? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:01:36
Divisible into a 100 000 000 smaller units but not infinite. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:01:45
So why do people say the bcahs is 100% Jihan? 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:02:51
That's why I don't understand why people support bcash, btc can already be slow sometimes when the network is being attacked and then bcash is 10 times slower ... how do people wait that long? 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:03:27
How come? I heard here many times that Jihan controls the BCH network, but you believe he also controls the BTC network? 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:06:40
So you are saying that bitmain controls both btc and bch? That would mean we are all hooped.

Brother come in to my arms, let's have crypto communion! 
What an awesome credo of the hodl faith. I love you! People like you will make the lambo dream come true, eventually. All it takes is faith and posting about it on reddit. The rest will be done by THE SYSTEM itself.

What if my phone has no connection the same moment somebody is trying to pay or send me money? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 03:44:05
Did they fix the bug where you have to be online to receive a payment? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:33:10
Exactly! I am okay with like newbies that don't know better use Bitcoin to buy LN network coins and then make payments because it's cool and nerdy thing to use crypto "currency" but I know that Bitcoin will be  something that the banks will use to settle settlements with each other. Very high value transactions. So if you hold just one coin it might end up being worth like maybe even a million dollars. If you know this you HODL, just like you don't take your gold with you to buy stuff with. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:34:45
Exactly.  I usually use paypal. It's way cheaper then Bitcoin and a lot easier and way more supported. At least online. For buying coffee I use coins. (Because of my work I get a lot of coins) 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:31:19
So LN has been released to early? Why did they release it to main net if they don't want people to use it? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:30:42
That's crazy! So you are not buying thing because you need them bust just so Bitcoin can flow like it's money? But Bitcoin is a store of value, LN is what is going to be used for payments, which will make Bitcoin more usable (because then more then 10 000 people can use it per day) and if Bitcoin becomes more usable the price should go up and you could make a lot of money or hold Bitcoin for like long time and  end up having a lot of buying power in 10 (15 years?) years or something. Right? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:35:07
How did you get Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:15:29
I think it's very cool that Bitcoin is progressing so much but personally I am just going to continue hodling.  
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:49:55
But paypal is way more supported on the internet. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:35:48
So going to a store and buying something with american dollars makes all the american dollars worth more? Why? How does that work? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:20:40
That is a very anti Bitcoin statement you just made. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:28:20
No I misread. I thought he was saying that people are to stupid for LN. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:05:12
If you HOLD how are you going to use the LN network?

Why is America so hostile towards technology? In Japan and Russia you  find a way better climate for this kind of technology and inovation.

The guy that created that meme has been banned from for his opinion that Bitcoin Cash is the Bitcoin that he wants.
and Bitcoin Core peeps make sure to get rid of every single creative person until only a hollow shell is left.
And they take about permissionless? And censorship resistant money? What a joke! Now THAT is hypocrisy.  But as you can see their censorship is failing cause I am still posting and you are still getting the message until the mods delete it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:28:11
The major wallet is the wallet from bitcoin.org right?

Making Bitcoin better or talking about making Bitcoin better is not allowed here unless it's about Lightning Network. The leaders here have decided that Bitcoin will forever be Bitcoin with a 1 MB limit. Anything else is not bitcoin by their definition. That splintered the entire community because most people did not agree and left, some of those that left are now returning and made their own bitcoin but with a higher blocksize limit. 
Those people are traitors right? They most be sued and banned and ridiculed and we must insult them at any given time. All because they have  a different opinion.
