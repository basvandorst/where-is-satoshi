I noticed they are using pictures of known pornstar Angel Dark and portraying her as an escort named Angelina on their website.This looks like a bait and switch guys so be careful.

I believe bits would be great for mainstream adoption for newcomers. Today I set  my mom up with her first bitcoin wallet. She is totally new to bitcoin but wanted to learn. So I installed Breadwallet on her Iphone which defaults to using bits. I sent her $20 dollars worth which showed up as 20,000 bits automatically. She was was super happy when she saw the 20,000 amount pop up. After explaining to her the different ways of denominating bitcoins I asked her if she preferred bits over BTC or mBTC to which she replied"  I like bits because the bigger amount makes me feel like I have a lot of money in bitcoins and the name is catchy too."  I was sold on bits from that moment on.

The bitcoins I had bought a couple of years ago had dropped more than 1/2 their value at one point but I continued to believe and HODLED on, even though some of my friends and family thought I was insane for doing so. Now some of the same friends and family are calling me up to learn more about bitcoin. It truly is a great feeling not losing hope, and seeing how this amazing technology has grown over the years, and how it is making a positive impact on so many people's lives.

I personally know a former newcomer to bitcoin who put all his bitcoins in a paper wallet, only to lose them all after partially spending the wallet because he didn't understand change addresses. Paper wallets can be a risky thing for newcomers if not used properly.

And lots of bitcoin have already been lost as well, combine that with a lower supply rate and you've got yourself an imminent moon landing for us HODLERS in the near future.
