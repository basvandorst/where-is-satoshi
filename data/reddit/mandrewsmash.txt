Having lost a bunch on a platform and also over half my portfolio value, all I thought to myself was "I'm not up 400% anymore, but I am still up 50% in less than 4 months... How can I get it back?" Also only putting in a medium initial amount has made this a wild ride of trades and learning. The value of what I know now is worth more than the money I put into this space. Cheers!

I know there are very few Bitcoin and precious metals investors, but Jamie Dimon is stringing us both together. JP Morgan has an ungodly huge short position in silver, suppressing the price while loading the boat for the past 7 years. I have a feeling his bashing of Bitcoin, filing patents, and possibly buying bitcoin is a similar tactic to keep prices down while he loads up. All the while he and his top advisor are saying flash crashes and social unrest in the US next year, bitcoin and silver hedging much?

I'm guessing you didn't watch the video, because the information is factual and well represented

I like [this explanation]( the best.

Bong and a Bitcoin? Smoke and a Satoshi? Marijuana and mining?
@_date: 2019-01-03 00:03:48
Wait. So you went through all the trouble to learn about Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin, buy a hardware wallet, and then put your anti-fiat anti-tax anti-gov value.... in a bank?

I've been making small ($5-$10) USD deposits and BTC withdrawals everyday and I can say for sure at least Coinbase has slowed down making those deposits available. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:49:45
I feel like Coinbase is slowing down deposits to gain higher fees for tomorrow. Anyone else feel this?
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:03:06
Still costly at $1.5k, but not $15k [Sigma]( Will verify up to 3mm deep, which is enough for 90% of gold coins/currency/bullion. I wouldn't knock precious metals due to their history and tangibility, personally hodling both :)
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:57:28
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:04:24
Ah, sorry the $0.07 was for $25 lol so that'd be 0.28%

[Here you go!](
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:33:13
No. On coinbasepro.com fees are much smaller than their app. I usually pay about 0.07$ per $10, not enough for me to care.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:02:46
I actually have done just this! A few months ago my gf and I quit smoking, and I have been putting that extra $ into crypto! Ha! I'm ahead if the curve here lol

Anyone want to buy 3 acres in the mountains of Colorado for 1 BTC? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:55:47
Yea. Lots of trees, close-ish to a lake. If you're interested I could send you the listing?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:33:57
I love crypto and crypto stocks and weed stocks, they’re all doing really well this year!
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:32:55
I used Coinbase to purchase my bitcoin and have now transferred them to the app Blockchain. It doesn't look like I can purchase more coin through Blockchain, how will I be able to purchase more coin in the future? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:42:27
Oh, I see how it is.... making exclusive clubs now? Oh, ok.. I'll just take my partial coin over here and make my own club! :)
Looks great BTW!!
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:45:02
Just wondering... I have some land I want to sell, what's the best way to go about selling it for Bitcoin? I've put it on Zillow with a comment saying I'll accept Bitcoin, same for Craigslist, but is there an exchange like those for people wanting to buy and sell online with Bitcoin? Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:12:18
[This]( is what I see happening. Been charting for a few years, still not the best but I think we need a bigger correction or a long time to trend sideways until the new year.
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:49:48
Friend of mine just tried to buy some coin through Coinbase and it showed as "pending" for a moment then both transactions disappeared but still charged his bank account. Could be related

Is there any comparable product to the 7nm technology that is available to the start up miner? I plan to start mining in 2018 and I want to start with good hardware 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:41:54
SO if you transfer your bitcoin to Gemini then you should be able get to access to your S2X coins? I should be able to do that and sell for more bitcoin? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:44:19
There's a wallet called Blockchain that I use, any thoughts on it?
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:47:30
How will this work if Coinbase goes the SX2 route? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:10:26
Awesome!! Hope we can all at least get 1!
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:39:21
Yes it does. The money with cobwebs on it in a regular savings account or in cash under your bed will lose its value to inflation. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:46:41
Since BTC can't do a "stock split", I think valuing Bitcoin will go down the line. Right now everyone cares about the price of 1 BTC but in 10 years if that number becomes too unfathomable then they'll look at the price of 1 mBTC and so on. Imagine 1 mBTC getting to $5000! 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:50:42
Speaking of bitcoin payments, if someone who knows how to set that up at a retail store could PM me I would greatly appreciate it! 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:44:05
Same. But I did switch to pick up some silver though.
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:45:34
Yes! Denver area? PM me please!
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:01:39
I agree, with Blockchain app for bitcoin I have my own keys and it works pretty well. What I guess my question is what other exchanges exist that won't support S2X where I can buy more bitcoin? So far I know of Gemini which seems pretty good
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:04:43
Anyone want to be the first to buy a couple acres of land in Colorado for Bitcoin? lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:57:11
Getting closer everyday

"Painting" the tape I see?
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:53:11
I laugh because getting a buyer in Bitcoin may be harder than I thought. I can pm you the listing if you're interested still
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:52:08
Except in the case that they lose all of their available loan money because everyone has realized Bitcoin's ability to store value and increase in value has vastly eclipsed the paltry 0.001% interest they get from a regular savings account.

This time, however, the recession will be due to the huge amount of debt the US has racked up and the failure of the USD. Since every world currency is pinned to the USD, every currency is going to fail. China and Russia are stacking tons of gold to get away from the USD and help give their own currencies independent stability. I'm buying silver and BTC. Silver has been used as money for thousands of years, limited supply, has many uses and is a financial safe haven. BTC has limited supply, blockchain has many uses, and used as digital gold. In a crisis, I believe for physical money, silver and gold will be used, and for digital money crypto will be used. just my 2 satoshis

Said some kid trapped on the sinking Titanic. 
**Woo Hoo! First Silver! Thanks stranger!
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:59:29
Yep, when you look at what is increasing value in BTC, BCH is  on that list - the likely culprit. IDK what MONA, WAVES, or STRAT do, but they'd be good for a ride as well it seems.
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:51:31
This one is pure copper. Worth about $0.35 usually sold for $1.50-$2.00. You can get a pure silver one for $16-$25. A pure gold one will set you back $1300-$1400.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:25:44
I'm really liking the cheap crypto right now! Have been out of the space for almost a year cause it got so expensive, but now I'm shopping around like it's black Friday, Christmas, and my birthday all in one! I might actually be able to get a whole bitcoin if it stays down here long enough. I'm excited for the future of this space and thankful for the sales!

The FED absolutely had its hands in the 2008 sub-prime mortgage crisis. People were able to pay for their variable interest rate mortgages when the interest rates were low, but then the FED pumps up the rate and now those people who over-extended themselves with their home can no longer afford to keep it. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:02:29
Their world did.

Once the next financial crisis is in full swing and everything has plummeted, I'm personally going to swoop up some pot stocks, index funds, and real estate. What do millennials want? Weed, Money, and a house lol Buying BTC and precious metals till then. Screw USD.
@_date: 2018-12-30 05:57:39
I was thinking January may see the low point and slow climb from there. I agree with your statements and hope we see it to fruition!
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:10:18
Always, buy and transfer immediately. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:36:54
I would be ok with that :)

@_date: 2018-12-23 03:29:20
Oh I believe they will. This is an 'everything' bubble this time, along with the US total debt (not just debt clock, but also derivatives and such) are/have sky rocketed. We are close to defaulting on the interest payment alone. The USD is in trouble and then that happens, it wont matter if you're getting paid cause the underlying currency is worthless. JP Morgan has been stacking silver and gold since 2011 and many other banks in China and Russia as well are moving away from the USD into other assets as well. This is a chance for the banks to get everything on sale, just watch. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:26:09
Not quite yet, looks like $3,600 is next resistance and selling is back in play. I'd say mid January then take off
