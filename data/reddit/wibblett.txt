You have to report any income you gain. In your example I don't think they would care if you don't report it. Let's say you sell some gun skins in CS:GO and make $300 or whatever. You have to report that. Do people report everything? Nope. Should they report everything? Yup.

[Hey where you at man?]( You should have bought during the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:55:14
Way more than that. Also you gotta factor in electricity costs because mining rigs eat up electricity.

@_date: 2017-12-23 02:26:40
I wouldn't look into mining unless you have some serious capital you're willing to invest. I would start buying from Gemini if you are in the US. I personally use Electrum for my wallet but people prefer using the nano ledger S wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:48:28
FIAT is universal right now. It's easy to use and easily accessible. It will take a long time for crypto to take over that. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:45:57
Why? Are you giving some away? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:13:10
Please don't take this troll's bait. Look at his post history. Someone clearly sold this guy an account. His post history is all from NSFW subs and all of sudden he became a Bitcoin "expert." Mods should ban this asshole before noobies start believing this crap.

It's when people start to panic sell so the price goes down but it usually goes back up and stabilizes. Which is why you should HODL!!

It was all a setup. An admin that worked on the site was an undercover DEA agent. He told Ross that another admin was stealing from the site and told Ross that they should take care of him. The agent also told him he knew a biker gang that could do it and so Ross said okay take care of it. If the douchebag agent would never have told Ross this would he have done it? I doubt it and the worst part was that the agent was also actually stealing from Ross.

He didn't have anyone killed, it was all fake which is why the charges were dropped.

Yes he did. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:25:01
You're confused because reddit comments should never be taken for face value. Ross created a website where people can buy and sell drugs. He strictly banned anything related to guns and child pornography. The only drugs he ever sold were at the start of the website and he only sold a couple of pounds of mushrooms. Once the money started coming he stopped selling. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:07:30
Child pornography was strictly banned from the website. What are you going on about?

The undercover agent told him that another admin was stealing from him. That's the fake part because he was the one that was actually stealing from Ross. All of the other charges are accurate but the murders were never real which is why they didn't charge him with anything with murder. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:03:29
Nope. That was against the rules. You couldn't sell any weapons or child pornography or hitman services.

The DEA agent pushed for the "hit" to be carried out. That's why the charges were dropped because any prosecutor knows they have no case and it will make the DEA look terrible so they dropped it.

I used to do local bitcoin but you can't find good deals anymore in my opinion. People are too greedy so you see a much higher asking price. That's the price you have to pay for anonymity.
