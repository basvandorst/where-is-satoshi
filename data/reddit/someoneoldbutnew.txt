Alright, thanks for the enlightened response. I was beginning to worry all the idealists had cashed out and were living as expats or on farms. 
I believe the critical tipping point is near, that people generally realize their mind is full of programmed thoughts and behaviors, they're unwilling to change their media addictions which perpetuate this mindset.
I've traded video game addiction for crypto addiction. ;) Maybe this is just the money worship waking up, but I haven't felt this engaged and alive with a job, ever. That is my internal struggle, I'm spending all this time and energy (and missed sleep!) on money, which I know has no intrinsic meaning beyond what I put on it.
In my mind, my time would be better spent on things which build meaning with other people, connecting in person, building art, reading books. I guess my post is really just a projection of my own conflict between my inner values and my actions, and trying to bring those back in line.

Coinbase is clearly compromised in favor of bcash, idk why this is a surprise.

I've been on the ride for a while, I like talk of changing the way things are structured, the wealth-displays are just so old world it's kind of disenchanting. I guess it's foolish to expect humans to behave differently then how they were trained, just because there's a new mechanism for enrichment and exploitation.
Ur right though, it does put us closer to mass adoption. I just don't want to give up the ideology of spreading out the wealth, why can't we have lambos for all? 
( I know why, because then it's not fucking special to have one )

Such an innovator. That's why Cuban is rich and everyone else is too stupid and lazy to be rich.

I think at that point we'll be saying that $100k gets you one bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:53:46
That is true.

Fuck Kraken. They're shady as fuck. They run market makers against your stop losses. I tried to get 70k out of their system and was unable to. Ultimately, I had to go the path you are being forced down, buy BTC and cash out elsewhere.

I've already paid my bank more fees for holding my money then I will ever spend in btc transactions

Thank you sir for attempting to elevate our discussion with smart humor.

Because nobody wants to say anything against the bull market. It's good to see some activity upward, there has been some small upward movement. My bearish TA:
Average Volume has been falling since 3/20, volume is not confirming this rise
Hourly range is &lt; $100, it was higher when we were ~$6700. 33% higher price should equate to a larger range.
3 Day Stoch RSI has been oversold since 4/12. Stoch is really fast, but we haven't seen a dip. Last time my Stoch was &gt; 80 for this long was the move from 10-20k.
However, at a certain point, you have to realize that it's out of our hands, and you just have to ride the whales, try not to get shook off by swishing of the tail.

I agree, the big price jump happened in early am hours for US, and was very quick. It could be that the whales are trying to jump start the market, or they're setting it up for another fall. Who knows?
All I know is I sold some at 8500 and 5 minutes later it's at 8900. FU bitcoin.
