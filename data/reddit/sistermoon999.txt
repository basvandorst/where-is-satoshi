@_date: 2018-01-28 08:58:26
paper wallet is when u wrote ur private key on paper. Its nothing odd or alien. It works with any coin
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:53:43
Because u can send btc from GDAX for free
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:09:33

How are you still alive losing 7 btc? i lost 0.02 and i jumped a bridge
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:28:27
Dont rush. BTC wont be at this speed. Otherewise it should be 100k in few months. so dont worry theres heaps of ups and downs
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:25:44
You need to link the screenshot and anything you have as proof in your post so it will be traken seriously. dont expect mods to pm you and ask for  proof
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:14
lol just hold u fucker
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:01:23
well do you have proof that this really happend to you? people make up alot of stories here. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:09
With this rise. i think it will crash bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:00:28
U dont even know asia's timezone,  Dip been here since 16 hours ago. u think asians sleep 23 hours a day and just wake up for 1 hour just to sell their coins and then go back to sleep?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:32:06
im also here to admit all other coins are shitcoins. I liked Neo, XVG and such and still have em but i consider them all loss.  Only and only bitcoin. 
But just to add there's another shitcoil which i always hated ( etherium ) so i never got any
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:11:24
He's retarded. 
I searched for "bitcoin" and same page came up. Im pissed. roger ver should be behind this.
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:55:43
Im comparing this time with 2017. This time price increase is steady and slow. Unlike 2017 which was insane.  I like it this way better.  and feel safer. 
Lets go to 18k soon.
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:34:07
Dont be this guy ^^^
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:47:17
If bitcoin gets banned. It drops to zero
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:41:17
My point was u never know what is it. i myself lost alot in shitcoins and even semi shitcoins. question is, was that money what i could afford to lose? Ofcourse not, I could have used it elsewhere  or bought bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:10:21
Buy some more then so we break 11k faster
@_date: 2019-06-06 11:40:30
Sorry im not a guy. So no need man up
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:25:28
WHy not use your own voice? 
Im downvoting this so u will learn to use your voice next time
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:32:25
It won't so far we had very steady and nice increase with corrections and all. so i think we are safe to sit at 10k. lets see what happens after this
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:14:28
Its not algorithm. You dont even know whats algorithm is.  
The guy searched for Bitcoin only.  look at image again. 
i also searched for bitcoin and same page came up
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:15:56

Problem with people like you is that you think usd is just a piece of paper and government can print out any amount it wants... NO! Economy is a science. Its like comparing gold with usd. Gold resources are limited, so is btc,  satoshi made the total suply and it will never increase. But usd resource never ends and can be replaced. Is why you cant compare btc vs usd and they compare it with gold.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:13:04
Read the first few lines only.  cuz the rest is bullshit

Can u plz explain how hard is to join a pool? Whats the requirments? Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:12:46
just look at latest sanctions that US put on Iran that if any other country deals with Iran will also get under US sanction and can not trade with US anymore. There was no force or ban. But they all listened and no country is trading anything with iran anymore. Being First Economic power in the world with the massive distance with second shows itself here.  Now you keep saying BTC is global which is True. But if USA detects it as a threat, its over. Let alone that Bitcoin is so sensitive that it can drop like $1000 with a useless hack news. so i hope you get my point.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:02:59
thats most stupid saying. because one can never know how much they can afford to lose. If u ask me, i cant even afford 1 buck to lose. Greed factor is very important
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:58:09
Advice in every investing is. take out your profit from time to time. i think you had enough profits by now. Sell some now and buy yourself something. and keep the rest. You're not gonna live forever and no one knows if bitcoin goes back to 3k again tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:32:52
Yep same... sadly..
Id wish it would go up more steady and slower. this FOMO is bad, we've seen what happens when it goes up liek this
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:25:06
U wish
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:12:43
It looks online. and i keep synchorozing  but still old price. Is this a flaw? how do u sync it

@_date: 2019-06-29 21:54:55
Decent means fast? Or with good ping/latency ?
and how much data will it use?
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:34:05
This device was about to give me a heart attack 2 days ago.. I logged in Ledger live and i saw my balance was 0!  I panicked and thought i was hacked, my hands were shaking. i kept clicke syncing. but balance still zero.. i looked at latest transactions and nothing there. After 10 mins of hard time i found out it didnt connect to bitfinex and had to change it to bitstamp
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:36:31
Coinbase and Wire transfer if you're in US.

@_date: 2019-06-01 19:46:57
You cant even compare. If BTC is goign to be a danger for USD thats A LOOOT different. Bittorrent could only hurt private companies. not the USA currency
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:02:56
I was thinking the same. But in reviews i didnt find it in first place. Keep in mind im talking about ANdroid wallet. not desktop.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:26:41
Exactly. 
TBH im more happy to see it went down 1000. cuz i remember 2017 and i dont want that speed again. It wasnt healthy. 
We should go up with correction and tight base
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:25:31
Stay tuned!
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:19:31
Always will/ 
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:12:37
Explain then
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:39:28
I hope you didnt sell.  
I remember in 2017 some people said the same and that it was nice, and they are out and sold at 10k. But then few weeks later they regreted big time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:41:29
Dumbest comment of Reddit. COngrats
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:27:09
You write the private key on paper and hide it in a book
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:29:46
It should go bck to 7k or at worst 8k.  dont panick buy
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:17:29
What does this "IF" Depend on?   Can you make your miner to go solo? If so whats the odds that it can win that 12.5 btc?
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:36:49
nope. my twitter is mostly politics. i only follow john mccoffe on twitter thats it about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:27:18
It will either go to your wallet or returns to his again. It wont b e lost.
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:14:23
Again there are parameters that make one strong, Its technology mainly. and like i said US is ahead of other first world countries by 20 years in technology. Otherwise you can see GBP value or even Kuwaiti currency worth more than the USD. But does any country Trade with these currencies? No. why? go learn and come back here
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:09:28
On coinbase you can withdraw to Paypal too after selling
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:02:06

You paid about $40 for transaction over 2fa lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:16:50
Ive forgot the name. But i can find it if i want. However . the bots needs to be configured daily which requires market information.  
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:22:41
big nose?
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:16:18
fixed lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:55:06
One thing is never rush. If you miss a dip dont worry. There will be more dips. Im sure if u could go to teh future you could see bitcoin dips down to 1000 even.  There are not written rules about bitcoin. A smart person is the one who buys and sell with profit. Holding is not bad but it's foggy. Bitcoin can be just a set of numbers tomorrow.  World Economy is not that good, it wouldn't mind to sacrifice bitcoin for it.  In fact bitcoin is the money that doesnt exist
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:25:32
Recover? lol It needs to fall atleast 3k more to be stable. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:54:35
Ive said this many times. Try not to pick a fight between USD and BTC.  USD is world's Strongest currency and a tool to dominate the world. Btc is another thing they can both work together. because i am sure world is not goign to be one country anytime. so do not think anything can defeat USD.  we can do our thing and USD is on its place too. Why compete?
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:25:24
How much did you lose total
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:29:41
Why did u become unemployed
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:00
Yes. do u have the public key?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:47:27
This way i see. It will go to 12k with no correction
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:03:46
you're saying this wallet was a gift. Now u say u bought it from Ledger?! which one is it
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:21:38
Coinbase is high? Its BTC price. + Fees.   Not sure where u can buy cheaper?
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:56:06
Damn $400 for only 0.04?!
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:23:12
@_date: 2019-06-01 13:16:01
is token sell bad?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:39:51
Sorry to hear that, And how old are you?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:41
Because one learns from mistakes.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:58:54
In fact i predict that in a day or max 2 we start goign up again. im willing to bet
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:53:33
2018 maybe. Not 2017
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:55:19
What alt coin do u recommend
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:18
Well banks usually do that. Not only on bitcoin. even on Amazon, You should  call them everyday. dont be shy
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:53:28
I know what bot they are using
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:15:14
Let us know how many bitcoins do you have now
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:09:39
Well see... Here is the paradox. Someone who is lagging for food or cloths or shelter, doesnt even know whats bitcoin, let alone investing in it. so someone who starts searching about bitcoin is the one who passed the first base and has atleast the basics of life.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:39:06
It wont go again. Experience talks. We will go up to 10k atleast
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:40:27
Follow the transaction address in  blockchain get the address.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:11:22
i want to see corrections. Its not healthy goign up so fast like 2017. Trust me been there seen that. Its not good. we need slow and steady increase in price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:11
There was another post here like this awhiel ago. The guy at the end  gave up his bitcoins. Looks like there's noway
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:07:03
How about coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:41:59
I thought when bitcoin wants to close an accoutn they let u send to another wallet first?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:44
I once tried sepa to verify my account. It took 15 quid fees just to send 6 euro . Banks rip u before it gets to gdax
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:07:17
What i say is coming out of public information. USA is 20 years ahead of other first world countries, Liek Germany, Uk or even Japan. that means what USA has now Germany will have in 20 years! America will never let anything damage it's being superpower in economywhat ever it will be it gets destroyed, no matter what, even if BTC gets somewhere one day that US sees it as danger they will shut it down for good
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:37:10
No. never,  USD value been the same for decades. That's what makes it powerful. Bitcoin is seen as investment for now, Like any other thing
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:45:26
Im glad.  I lost 200 as well
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:50:17
Really. How many BTC do you have
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:19:37
In Technology. Simple. By technology its not what you see in daily life. It's what you don't see in daily life. Technology built for Government use only Like Aircrafts, shuttles, Mega computers and devices Used to protect the country against a war even if its economical war.  
Btw also In daily life just take CPUs out of computers and they are nothing. Intel and AMD are both American.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:34:39
Thank you so much for the good info. 
SO ur saying  joining a pool is not always garanteed?  I guess it needs fast internet and such too huh?  
Also any chance the asics get broke down or needs to be serviced?  
Lets say if electricity is free. how much would up to 3 asics make a day in BTC/USD .
Thank you so much

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:34:41
You will get 2 address.  Public and private.  Private address ( key )  Is the one u should write somewhere offline.  Public address u can check the balance on blockchain or any balance checker
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:32:46
Ive sold myself at 10k. I wont be buying back, i have experience. It will go down again it shold correct the instant crazy growth from 7k to 10k, let alone from 10 to 11600

@_date: 2019-06-23 19:09:02
Yes but remember, dont give them BTC address while they want to send you another coin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:19:31
Is this real?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:21:44
For a few hundereds its just safe on coinbase. no need for a offline wallet.  i have few thousands in coinbase. its safe
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:07:41

I had the same question last week. I ended up with Electrum. Best wallet hands down
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:19:12
My experience says now. Because from now, to 18k is garanteed bullish market
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:05:09
well it's always good to ask for advice. Im new so im not sure what to do, I dont want my investment goes to zero and i regret not selling at 10
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:19:14
How did you predict this?
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:29:00
Thank you for the info. But with teh way ur describing id say no its not porofitable. since its cost to buy a miner or asic.  
One other question since ur doing it yourself...
WHats teh chance of not being able to be connected to a pool? 
How difficult is it to join a pool, Does it need any requirmentS? 
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:36:18
Are you  a day trader now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:08:24

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:08:43
whats wrong with that. They are just empoyees like u. buying botcoin is not a crime. You can proudly say you were buying bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:04:41
But i see many peopel are gettign out of Bitcoin.  they say 10k is end of bitcoin for a while. gets me worried
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:41:54
Ive had these thoughts before. Never works. Chance was 2 years ago. Nowdays its saturated
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:08:58

@_date: 2019-06-27 11:38:46
how much did it go down? i was sleeping, i woke up and saw it at 12500, its 12400 now. 
whats this negative posts here?! 
TBH im happy to see it went down liek this. cuz im from 2017 i remember all this. it wasnt healthy to go up so fast.  i want steady and slow with correction increase in price. i still think we need to go up and back down to 11500 atleast 2 more times. then we can continue goign up
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:51:00
Thank you
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:41:00
Get atleast 100. 
15 is a joke
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:39:37
You dont get it. We dont want such terrorist regimes Use bitcoin. Because then the US might put a ban or some regulation for bitcoin and thats not what we want.

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:19:43
what you read was fake news.  Bitcoin buying or selling is no bad. My bank called first time and asked what i was tryign to do. i said i was goign to buy bitcoin. she had no idea what was bitcoin so she said ok thanks
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:18:46
solution is only upate after a day or 2 to make sure if there was  a bug they cught it
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:23:55
For this moment $7000 or max 7500 is reasonable

You changed your phone without sorting out your accoutns  first? Also you changed your number too?   That's fishy. I wouldnt let u login either.  Maybe someone had died and you took them computer. I hope CB will never let u in
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:12:40
Online exchange like coinbase is safer than ur offlien wallet, Offlien u can get hacked or do a mistake that all ur coins go missing. Look at exchange like a bank. unless u have a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:55:31
Bitcoin will never die. this reason alone that all other coins are bing traded with bitcoin means. if bitcoin dies whole crypto dies

Litecoin is expensive. You could look into. raiden, neo, blocks, shift. verges.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:45:54
Well TBH it wont be profitable for you to get in now. Even people who invest with 10k+ thousand dollars are still afraid. I suggest you to look at other cheap Altcoins. You know bitcoin is not the only one. 
Where are you from origianlly btw that you say ur a foreigner
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:48:00
Your post is very one sided. you're looking at the half full of the glass. There's a risk to all bitcoin holdering every minute.  In one day USA sees USD in danger because of Bitcoin they will make it illegal and when US does it the whole world should... Because US is the biggest economy in the world. And that day is bitcoin holder's nightmare. we may end up waking up with nothing but a set of numbers in our Computers
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:22:56
You buy Bitcoin. it automatically goes to your public address on the site i buy from. When you want to move it from the exchange to your paper wallet, you will send it to your paper waller public address
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:09:48
It should go back to 8k or 9 atleast, so people who sold at 10 can buy back.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:57:58
Depends, how much... If its under 500 yes go ahead and buy. if its more than that then yes go ahead and buy. But hODL

Regulation is not possible and not good either. Otherwise it will be just like stocks
@_date: 2019-01-04 04:29:46
In fact its one of new business that can make heaps of money since its new. if people find out about it they will all rush into opening a bitcoin store. Where sell bitcoin from a place they can see and feel and trust, and learn about bitcoin as well. as well as buying other merchants like Hardware wallets 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:14:52
what does it mean? good or bad?
@_date: 2019-01-04 04:27:17
Its simply a exchange store. Like where you go exchange your Dollar for EU . But here you get Bitcoin.

Why would u leave ur phone at repair shop for 5 weeks?!!!! the repair guy prolly have ur code and transferrered ur coins by now. when u have such critical information in ur phoneu should stand there in repair shop and they fix it front of ur eyes. not leave it there for 5 weeks!!!!!

I sold ETH ( the most shit coin ever ) to buy btc. But btc went so fast  i was left out
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:57:29
Yes i sold my ETH at $660.  held abit to get more btc. But it fired up fast. Its ok thou i bought btc with 70% of the money on a loss and kept 30% in case it goes back down so i get more.  But im happy i never sold any bitcoin. Ive learned that lession before. Whenever i sold bitcoin to buy back more, i ended up buying back less 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:58:17
If we go to 12k in 24 hours. I will give you 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:24:45
The alts go down with BTC but they cant keep up when BTC goes up.  so recovering for alts is always really hard. And when i say alts. ETH is anoother Alt as well
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:51:13
Yeh. And why coinbase mods dont remove it? wtf? its been 17 hours and thats still there
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:38:49

what are the chance of Electrum's Seed ( private key) be cracked?  Lets say there are 100,000  electrum wallets. it means 100k seeds, right?  So if someone cracks a random  seed it will be one of those 100k  seeds?  so does it not make chance of successful crack x 100k?   or for cracking a wallet's seed you would need to know the public address too?   That's what im curious to know
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:47:33
That's good then. I guess other alts including ether and all other alts are nto like that right? 
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:50:35

ive said this 2 weeks ago.. This exactly feels like 2017.  this time we should learn from experience we have. ( the ones who remember 2017)  experience is
1: do not trade! Just buy and hodl. 
2.. Do not wait for 200 300 bux dip to buy. Just buy Now
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:06:51
I buy there ans then move to my personal wallet. i have hard ware wallet. But you can use Electrum. Its a software wallet. I used to use Electrum before i bought a ledger Nano
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:03:52
Let me tell you... Even if bitcoin price was same as 3k now, u wouldnt have bought with your first job's money. Its human nature. You will only buy when u see its goign up.  Same example for me. I had money sitting for a while. Never bought any butcoin at 3k. ( i had some  before and still hodling ) but when i saw it's goign up i jumped in buying. soo yeah
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:20:51

I had a dream last week. that i saw bitcoin dipped and i was real sad. It was around $600 and i remember ive recently bought all my money on coinbase pro to buy bitcoin at 6700. then i rushed to get to my laptop to see how i can buy the dip at 600. i was so nervous to buy at 600. i couldnt believe i had no money. i was trying to turn laptop on to buy with debit card. but it was soo slow.  just like all dreams it was lagging so bad. took like forever for laptop to turn on. then suddenly i woke up and realized it was a dream and took a comfort breath. hahaha
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:11:32
Electrum wallet has 3 parts  1: the software  2: the wallet file. 3: Private Key 
Yes you can store the wallet file and private key in a USB flash disk. then whenever you need to send or recieve BTC, connect the USB. Load up your wallet file in electrum enter password and do your thing. Thats what i always did.  ( Keep in mine your private key aka seed should be always offline )
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:36:10

Nowadays any retard is a analysis with his chart. not anything that u can make charts with upon price can be analyzed   the same way.  with bitcoin you cant predict anything. ATM you can see usage is going up and higher than always, a normal person liek me can understand Bitcoin will go up
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:52:27
Nope and nope. Nano ledger s. only makes sure u dont send or recieve your coins without phisically pushing the confirm button on the device.  It has a app too called ledger live where you can see your coins and portfollio on it without even needing to connect your device. But your bitcoins are like any other cold or hot or software or any other wallet will be on the blockchain. :)
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:10:41
2900. Thats exactly when i started buying. However at the begining i was noob. i started buying some alts like NEO.  Then bought other ALts. Now i consider all my alts gone.... 
Lesson is : HODL ONLY BITCOIN ,  ALL OTHER ALTS ARE USELESS. FROM  ETHER TO TETHER .   ONLY BTC IS WHAT WE WANT AND NEED.

Trust me, we dont want Iran's Terrorist regime starts using bitcoin as a government.  Because then US will have to stop this and probably put a ban or regulation on Bitcoin and whole crypto

NY post is filled with bunch of globalists and democrats and shady people working for them and getting paid for shitty articles. I thought it only sucked in politics. Now i see it sucks in all aspects haha

Yes otherwise your money is stuck. also BTC. so make sure you have docs before purchasing any

In fact. if u look at the email you got from coinbase where it says you recieved x btc. It says when it will be available. :)

How about in UK?
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:53:23
Thank you. Ive heard Kraken is good but looks like it needs to be SEPA. Im looking for something that i can buy with normal bank transfer. Coinbase has this for UK.bank transfers are always free and takes about 1 or 2 hours for me. But i want to move to another exchange because of recent 5 days hold up.

Sad to read this. But in other hand i think the attacker did a very pro and good job for this. Everythign was planned. I think he kinda deserved the money too.  its same story of rabbit and fox. Dont be a rabbit. 
However no need to bitch at you. This could happen to all of us. I myself had good amount on CB for more than a year. its not that i didnt think or care about moving it. It was id say  i do it later. Human nature.  Well sorry again for your loss.  Hope it wont happen again
