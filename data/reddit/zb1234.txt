In your experience, do verifications of transactions take long? This one only took about a minute to confirm which is great. Is one confirmation usually enough?

Is it relatively instant to see the fund in the account?

Have you done this before, I've never actually heard this from anyone. Won't there be logs of the funds and where they went that localbitcoins has?
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:38:42
I'd ask you why you think that.
@_date: 2014-07-17 23:46:26
I will do this. I have my paper wallet ready and I will wait for 1 confirmation before handing over the cash.

Well bitcoin Fog supposedly only keeps them for a week or so, which is much better. Any word on Darkwallet?

Well I only use these services because they're all I have at the moment. There's no trust really, but no option either, that's why I'm doing as much research as possible before choosing which one I'm going to use.

Thanks for the tip to test :) I tried to send the amount to a test paper wallet but it's too small of an amount to withdraw apparently.

Cool, I downloaded the app, but I also have a paper QR code cutout.

Thanks so much, I've got to get involved in bitcoin tipping. I'm testing the app and the time it takes to verify (I'm sure it varies).
edit: awesome. It just updated, confirmation didn't take long at all. Thanks for all the help, seriously!

Yeah but say I put tainted bitcoins in then withdrew from the shared wallet, the deposit and withdrawal are still linked because of the account so if I ever linked the newly withdrawn coins to my ID they know they were at one point tainted BTC.

If there is no such thing as a hot bitcoin then why do people get arrested when the bitcoins are used for illegal activities? 
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:56:30
I am trading in person, not through the service. Also, if it was no big deal then wouldn't authorities just not bother to follow the transaction chain to link an identity?

I downloaded mycelium but I don't see how to use my cold storage wallet. I do not want to enter the private key anywhere. Edit: Nevermind I see it. Thanks.

Thanks! I actually created my paper wallets through bitaddress.org and everything seems to be working great!
