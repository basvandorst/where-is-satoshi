I'm curious what you think about this presentation:
I'm not super educated but the argument seems convincing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:23:12
I'm not convinced BCH has more potential to be centralized than BTC does. (Especially given BTC's proposed scaling solutions like lightning, which could arguably result in a detrimentally centralized hub-and-spoke layer 2, along with the majority of transactors being priced out of layer 1.)
And neither of them has a CEO, that's for sure. Businesses have CEOs, not coins, and anyone who proclaimed himself "CEO of Bitcoin" or "CEO of Bitcoin Cash" is full of it.

What do you mean "All Alt-coins based off of bitcoin"? Being "based off of" Bitcoin and being a **hard fork** of Bitcoin are two very different things, right?

Thanks for taking the time to respond.


Why do you assume that the "maintainers" are the commiters? Googling who has commit access to the bitcoin github returns this result: 
According to that link, Pieter Wuille, employed by Blockstream, is one of only four people with current commit access.


I am familiar with most of those channels, thanks. The original point of the question was to determine if those with commit access are the ones who have the power control the bitcoin protocol. It seems like that is the case, right? It's those with commit access that approve pull requests, right? It's those with commit access that eventually implement an improvement plan or not, right?


Did you mean to link to a specific message or thread? That's just the home page for the mailing list. Also, I'm not sure what you're asking me to prove. I've only been arguing that there is a conflict of interest, and that those with the conflict of interest have the power to affect the bitcoin code, haven't I?


Right but, if there haven't been any other implementations of their patent, then the fact that they haven't used them offensively thus far is meaningless right? I'm not saying they're definitely going to go back on their word, I'm just saying that that's a lot of trust to accept that they will. Why require that much trust instead of releasing it under a general public license with no patent it at all? Once it's released, no one else can patent it, right?


Sure. Segwit removes the witness data from the block and places it another data structure. That makes it possible to mine on top of a block before it's accompanying witness data has been released.
(That is impossible without segwit because the next block needs the previous block's hash, and the previous block's hash would change from not having the witness data to having it. But with segwit, only the merkle root of the witness data is included in the block itself, and so having the associated witness data or not makes no difference as to whether you could start mining on top of that block.)
That fact opens up an attack vector where an attacker could regularly release blocks without the accompanying segwit data (which would, by default, be ignored by nodes following segwit protocol), only to release the accompanying witness data right as a different block was found so that that block would be orphaned and the attacker's block would be next valid block. After doing this consistently, the other miners could be "trained" to start mining on top of his block even without the witness data at first, since to not do so would be wasting electricity (that is, they would be trying to find the current block when they know another miner has already found it).
If any significant number of miners end up mining on top of that block (which is likely considering the fact that it would be more profitable for them to do so), it would be possible for the malicious miner to eventually not release the witness data at all, leaving any other miners to either 1. Go backwards and enforce segwit protocol, forgoing the huge amount of wasted electricity used mining on top of the block whose witness data was never released, or 2. Keep their profits and just keep going, letting the malicious miner do whatever it is he did to funds in segwit addresses. Segwit would be effectively broken at that point and, if some miners decided to go back to fully enforcing segwit protocol and some didn't, you could even see a chain split occur
The fact that miners could easily be incentivized to ignore segwit data is what's so bad about segwit. We want miners to be incentivized to do the "right" thing not because it is right, but because it is profitable for them, in the short and long term. It's the only way you can trust the system.

I'm not talking about the grounds on which we call something Bitcoin. I'm talking about the grounds to use the word bitcoin in the name. Bitcoin Cash uses the word bitcoin, and for good reason.


It should also be de-legitimized (or not) based on its own merits, not by people who insist on calling it by a name that obfuscates what it actually is, which is a fork of Bitcoin.

And on top of that, by that logic then Satoshi holds the Bitcoin brand, in which case all changes since he stopped developing aren't Bitcoin.
You suggested that the "Bitcoin project" has the right to the name Bitcoin, but who's to say that a fork of Bitcoin isn't a continuation of the "Bitcoin project?" It seems like you mean specifically "those with commit access to the Bitcoin github repo", but that sounds like a pretty narrow definition of the "bitcoin project" to me, with one single point of failure, the developers. That's not so great for a decentralized permissionless uncensorable currency.

I'm not arguing that they should switch the names in any situation. What I'm arguing is that a specific point made in this video sounds like nonsense.
He argues that an exchange wouldn't list bch as btc specifically **because** then the "new btc" would crash to the price of the "old bch", among other things. But what makes him think that they'd list Bitcoin Cash at the price of btc before the ticker change, just because it was taking over the ticker symbol? Isn't it obvious that, if they renamed btc to something else (BitcoinCore, or whatever), then they'd just list it at its price before the ticker change, and Bitcoin Cash's price would be whatever its price was before the ticker change too?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:05
It sounds like he's arguing that, if they were to switch the names, they wouldn't switch the current prices. But, in the hypothetical situation where an exchange wants to called "bitcoin cash" "bitcoin", of course they would switch the prices too, right??
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:51:11
People in this sub do, yes, mostly because of its support of bitcoin ca$h. They argue that by promoting bch, bitcoin.com is trying to pass it off "as" Bitcoin. You'll have to go look for yourself to decide whether you think that that's the case.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:15:05
The name having the word Bitcoin in it conveys the information that it is a fork of bitcoin, right? You could argue that neither "bcash" nor "Bitcoin Cash" is perfect (causing 0 misinformation or 0 confusion), but "Bitcoin Cash" is, objectively, more accurate isn't it?

The segwit soft fork allows for an "effective block size increase", and the 1.6mb block to which you're referring contained transactions that, without segwit, would take up 1.6mb in a block. The witness data is removed from the transactions to put elsewhere, however, which allows the structure I'm referring to as a block to be &lt;1mb (else it would be rejected by old nodes, which would make it not a soft fork). The transactions are made smaller by moving part of them elsewhere.
People will argue that the segregated witness data is still "part of the block", but that comes down to your definition of "part of the block". If by "part of the block" you mean it's part of the "data that's sent on the bitcoin network", then sure, it's "part of the block".
But, since segwit was a soft fork, that data is ignored by nodes that haven't upgraded to segwit. So are those nodes only processing part of the block? I'd argue that that's a silly way to define what the block is. The block is better defined as what needs to be hashed to allow you to mine transactions into the next block. You don't need the segregated witness data to do that (because of the way segwit addresses were designed to default to effectively being the scary sounding "anyone-can-spend" addresses), which is why segwit blocks are accepted by non-upgraded nodes. And so, at least by that definition, the witness data is not "part of the block", and blocks are still limited to 1mb. You just have the option to use a feature that decreases the size of your transaction within the block by moving part of it elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:45:00


No, because newbies hardly know what bitcoin is, let alone what a fork is. But it's very clear that it's a different thing from what is currently considered "the" Bitcoin, the thing valued at just under 10K.


1. Could you link me to them?  I've never heard of them.
2. The fact that they exist doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin Cash's name makes sense because it **is** a fork of Bitcoin... I'm not sure what point you're making by saying that there are a bunch of "Bitcoin [Blahs]" that are not forks of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:29:16


I mean, it's not my word, it's the word of the guy who made the post. And the responses in that thread seemed to support the list the OP made.




That's kind of the point here. Sure, they try to reach consensus with as many developers as possible. But if they can't, who has the power to, or not to, implement code? Those with commit access.


To convince you of what, exactly? So far, I've argued that Blockstream employees have a conflict of interest, and that those with commit access have influence over the direction of development. I don't think that, so far, I've argued that it happened specifically with the blocksize. I think that they've managed to find "consensus" in that regard by including people who agree with them, and shunning those who don't. Take a look again at the list of those with commit access: 
Jeff Garzik and Gavin Andresen both supported bit blocks, and lost commit access in 2016 after not contributing to the code for some time. They left arguably because of the discrediting and smear campaign run against them, to the point where many in this sub consider them "enemies of bitcoin" for supporting big blocks. It's easy to achieve "consensus" if you've got control over who has a say, and can ridicule anyone who disagrees with you out of the development space completely. So now we've got the Core development team supporting small blocks, and anyone who doesn't is working on Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin ABC, or Bitcoin Classic. That's not consensus, that's a split. It just so happens that Core is the "incumbent" implementation, and so has kept the name, while the others have to "catch up", as far as support/adoption goes. (Or release a competing implementation without replay protection, as is happening with S2X.)


Adam Back (2015) (before he was Blockstream CEO): "My suggestion 2MB now, then 4MB in 2 years and 8MB in 4years then re-asses."
Pieter Wuille (2013) (before he was Blockstream co-founder): "I'm in favor of increasing the block size limit in a hard fork, but very much against removing the limit entirely... My suggestion would be a one-time increase to perhaps 10 MiB or 100 MiB blocks (to be debated), and after that an at-most slow exponential further growth."


The existence of sidechain applications that don't require full blocks **doesn't imply** that they **aren't** deliberately restricting blocksize to make other sidechain applications that **do** require full blocks viable. It only means that they are *also* developing side chains that don't require full blocks to be viable.


Please do watch the video. The malicious miner could have nodes all over the networking listening for new blocks and, once another was found, he could release his block's witness data, making his block valid (as far as segwit protocol is concerned) and orphaning the other valid block. Doing this consistently would lead to a situation where miners would know that the witness data was going to be released eventually, and where miners would know that they're losing money for ever second they mine for the current block instead of the next one on top of the block released without witness data. Sure, it seems like a bad idea to mine on top of it specifically because **eventually** that malicious miner could not release the witness data at all, and then the other miners who mined on top of it would have wasted electricity mining on top of it... but miners are trying to make money, and I wouldn't blindly trust them to not make *more* money in the short term, even if it means ignoring segwit protocol. That's the real issue. Segwit changes the short term incentives for miners **away** from validating transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:31
Blocksize is currently limited to 1mb, so only 7 transactions per second can get through. The decision to not increase that limit is the biggest point of contention in the scaling debate, and is arguably the main reason for the chain split on August first.
edit: segwit does increase transaction throughput to more than 7 tps. In normal conditions with 100% segwit usage (in that block), at least according to [this]( "since real-world transactions use about 40% of their space for signatures, you end up with closer to 2 MB", or "up to around 3 MB" if there are more complicated transactions.", so a doubling or, sometimes, tripling of capacity.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:31
Thanks for your detailed response!


[The link you provided]( seems to be very specifically talking about how he wants "transaction types" to be flexible, and so he coded in the possibility for scripts to be created that could be evaluated by the network. Does segwit take advantage of those scripts?
My understanding is that segwit puts the merkle root of the witness data in the coinbase transaction, and uses addresses that are treated by default as anyone-can-spend address until you reference the witness data broadcast separate from the block itself. Does any of that have to do with these transaction scripts he's referencing?


He's almost definitely not discouraging hard forks in that link... he's discouraging "a second, **compatible** implementation" (emphasis mine). By which it looks like he means a second client software that is **compatible with the Bitcoin network**, which is the opposite of a hard fork (which becomes incompatible by default and results in its own network). He's discouraging the attempt at a second compatible implementation because of the possibility that if "the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly on both". That isn't the case with BCH, which made a clean break.


Yes, he put it there as an anti-spam/anti-DoS measure, right? Do you have a reference to what he considered the sort of situation that would constitute "if the network truly needed it"?
The most relevant quote I can find is this one:


Where he seems to treat it as a non-issue. What could possibly more constitute the the network "truly needing" a blocksize increase than the blocks being full?


Right, that makes sense, and at the end you mention that it would be being kept lightweight so that it would be "available (and affordable) for as many users as possible to join in and participate on the network".
Doesn't that last sentence apply to transactions at least as much as, if not more than running nodes? As in, the majority of block space should to go to transactions so that the transaction capacity could be maximized? And isn't transaction capacity now being limited by the blocksize?


It seems like you're arguing here that because we don't have enough full nodes running, we should reduce transaction capacity. But isn't transaction capacity necessary for adoption? In which case we should go the opposite direction?
I guess what it really comes down to is: Do you think that the number of nodes would not increase as adoption increases? Sure, a smaller **percentage** of users might run full nodes as blocks got bigger (if blocksize outpaced moore's law), but bigger blocks would imply higher adoption rate, and as long as adoption rate increase (percentage-wise) outpaced the decrease in those who run nodes, then we would end up with a net increase in nodes.


Sure, anyone who argues that hashrate defines Bitcoin (or probably more accurately, total accumulated proof of work defines Bitcoin), and then defines Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin is contradicting themselves. But how would its lack of lacking the most accumulated proof of work invoke the wrath of Satoshi? It seems like he would just says "Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin until, if ever, it overtakes the current Bitcoin in accumulated proof of work."


Do you have a source for this? Specifically about most mining pools that mine bch being subsidiaries of Bitmain?
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:11:58
Thank you for the reference. You ignored my second point though.
What point did you intend to make by pointing out that there already exist many "Bitcoin [Blahs]"? This conversation was about whether Bitcoin Cash should have the word "bitcoin" in it. My point was that, because it is a fork of bitcoin, it has good reason to. Pointing out that there are alt-coins that also have the word "bitcoin" in them doesn't nothing to refute that point.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:48
It's a hard fork of bitcoin, caused by a lack of consensus in the scaling debate. A hard fork is different from an "alt-coin" (or is a subset there-of, depending on your definition of alt-coin) in that it share's btc's history up until August first (when the split occurred). Everyone who had btc before the split had bch by default.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:20:23


The idea was not to restrict. You can call a coin whatever you want. The point was that Bitcoin Cash has objectively **better grounds** for using the word "Bitcoin" in its name.


No, that's not what follows. What follows is that there are thousands of alts of varying success, and then there are forks of bitcoin of varying success. And there is no reason to lump a fork of Bitcoin that is  market cap in with altcoins just to legitimize calling it "bcash".
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:56:40
Thanks very much for taking the time to put this together. I have a couple questions.


Do you have any numbers to back this up? I see the logic and potential for a problem, but wouldn't rejecting invalid TXs and invalid blocks be an insignificant amount of work compared to the work they do mining valid transactions, and require an insignificant amount of bandwidth compared to the bandwidth that they would need to have available anyway?


Similar question here: Do you have any data supporting the idea that the nodes run by miners would not be more than enough full nodes to keep the network clean from invalid blocks and TXs? If going from only miners running full nodes to most every user running a full node increases the effectiveness/robustness of the filtering process by 10% then that sounds totally worth prioritizing everyone user being able to run a full node, but not if it only increases it by 0.00001%.


I don't follow you here. Could you explain (or provide a link) what you mean by "monitor the traffic", and what a malicious actor would do with this monitoring?


One could argue that the market is an enough powerful mean to have a vote on how Bitcoin should evolve, meaning the market can express the feeling about a decision on the Bitcoin protocol by making the price drop or making the price rise a lot when they announce a new feature in the Bitcoin protocol.
But, besides being a drastic measure (would you really like to express a vote by reducing Bitcoin value?), that's a faulty assumption because the market doesn't give a damn about the Bitcoin technology. Most of the big investors and traders, that actually move the market, care more about making money than allowing for the common people to have a revolutionary new kind of money.
They don't care about common people. Common people don't move the market price. You could never coordinate so many people at once in order to sell or buy enough to move the price. If you would be able to coordinate many people and sell/buy 1000 BTC that would be like a sneeze.
How could common people have a voice in deciding how Bitcoin should evolve? If you don't have literally millions you can't move the price. What people could do is to run full nodes that enforce consensus rules. If the vast majority of people decide that the rules miners (or the developers want) are not fair, people should have the ability to vote on that.
Wouldn't mass adoption flip that situation? With enough people using bitcoin, even the biggest players' attempts at influencing the price would become a sneeze, and the reaction of millions upon millions of people to changes in the protocol most certainly *would* move the market price, without needing to coordinate/collude at all. It would happen naturally, as long as the average person can move their bitcoin relatively freely.


If they wouldn't put their pool name in the blocks they mine we wouldn't even know who mined them.
Most of the miners run customized versions of the regular software. This doesn't mean they are cheating, they do this for technical purposes, it's perfectly legit. They can run whatever they want.
So if you can't be sure they run a "certified" node software how can you check which consensus rules they are running? How would you know if the consensus rules at some point changed because of a closed port meeting they had, let's say, in NY or in HK?
The Bitcoin network is described as trustless because you don't have to assume that the other nodes are correct nodes, on the contrary, every node assumes that the other nodes it is connected to, could be malicious nodes and therefore every node validate in autonomy every blocks and every TXs. Everyone checks one everyone else no one trusts anyone.
Miners behave correctly only because the can't form a cartel. And that's only because if they would do that, they would be cut off the network by the other nodes who enforce consensus rules. Which consensus rules? The ones that the vast majority of the nodes run. Not the ones that only miners run.
Let's say enough miners went behind everyone's back to perform a 51% attack on the network and succeeded because they also were in control of the majority of the nodes. Wouldn't it take only 1 single honest node to notice? And when the word got out that the miners had performed a 51% attack on the network, wouldn't that destroy trust in bitcoin and, in turn, destroy its price? Sure, the miners who attacked the network would have more bitcoin, but that bitcoin wouldn't be worth diddly squat if the word got out. Which it would, unless there were literally 0 honest nodes, right?
So isn't it not in miners' best interests to form a cartel, even if they could "get away with it"? Because the bitcoin that they "got away with" would be worth nothing when the word got out, and the word most definitely would get out unless it was literally a 100% attack?

Also, just so you know, when you say "lol. you big blockers crack me up", it makes you seem like a troll instead of someone who's trying actually trying to clarify/help/debunk/debate/whatever.
I'm not a "big blocker", as if it's a religion or a club. I'm someone who's currently convinced that big blocks are the way to go, but could be convinced otherwise if it turns out I didn't have a good enough understanding, or that my understanding was wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:32:33


It's not what I based it off of, it's the conclusion I came to =P I based the argument on the premise that non-mining nodes aren't an important part of the equation and, *therefore*, one needn't worry about the average user being able to run one. (Non-mining nodes don't even exist in the White Paper, which, if they are this important, would be a pretty big oversight for the inventor of the currency, right?)


It's not that they shouldn't run them because they don't have the resources, it's that running a non-mining node is not an important part of the bitcoin ecosystem, and so smaller businesses, countries, organizations, groups, or municipalities would have no reason to.
And even at **visa level** adoption, running a node would not be so expensive that a small business couldn't, if it really wanted to, run a node. 
My understanding is that the only people that have a reason to run a full node are miners, and (except in the event of a 51% attack where one mining entity has more hashpower than the entire rest of the world combined) the longest chain being broadcast by those mining-nodes is by definition trustworthy, because of the *way bitcoin and the proof of work algorithm work*. Any miner trying to screw people out of their coins without majority hashpower will generate a shorter chain because its transactions will be rejected by the other miners, and that chain will simply be ignored by SPV wallets. Meanwhile, that selfish miner will have wasted costly electricity and gotten nothing out of it.


Could you explain how nodes verify blocks and verify transactions? They propagate them sure but, as I understand it, they don't do any verification work. As for C, as long as the hashpower is not dangerously centralized (Which it is not, and can be tracked transparently  that means there are plenty of copies of the ledger for redundancy purposes because each mining node is, of course, a node.

They don't "just" work for a company developing products for Bitcoin. They work for a company that develops products for Bitcoin **and** they work on the *Core development team*. This clearly leads to a conflict of interest where they could, at least *potentially*, take bitcoin in a direction that benefits their company and not the users. (They don't even have to have a money making model. All they have to do is somehow make their investors happy so that they bring in more money in their next round of funding.)
I'm not even suggesting necessarily that any of that is happening. I'm only arguing that there is a potential conflict of interest. Do you disagree with that?


I didn't say anything about those guys. They could be bitcoin messiahs or they could be scammers, that's not relevant to our conversation. (Bringing them up also makes you look like you need a scapegoat.)


There is no way to know what the price "would" be in certain situations, so you can't come to conclusions like that based on the price. (Maybe people don't trust core, and if they did the price would be $40k.) Unless you can objectively link the 4k price to some metric of how much people trust the core devs, there's no substance to that argument.


At the moment, they make money from investors. Those investors have special interests, and want to see specific things come from their investment. The question to ask is, what do they want, and how do they think Blockstream is going to deliver? (This is an especially relevant question if Blockstream *isn't* going to be making money from their open source developments directly. If that's the case, what's in it for the investors?)
This is essentially like campaign finance in politics. How can you trust a politician that accepts hundreds of thousands of dollars from special interests to get elected when, once elected, they have the power to give those same special interests special treatment? You can't.


You *should* be more skeptical of the scientists who gain to benefit from their findings, even if you agree with their findings. It doesn't mean they are wrong. It means you should be skeptical and, only once you get it independently verified by other scientists who do not have a conflict of interested should you take it seriously. (Which has already happened for climate change, where there is overwhelming consensus in the scientific community.)
There is not overwhelming consensus, however, on whether the goals of Blockstream are better for Bitcoin. You've just got the core devs who are telling you it's what's best, and giving their argument for why they think it's the case. (Whether or not you think their argument holds up is up to you.) That's a relatively small group of people to trust, especially given a potential conflict of interest, right?

I didn't think this was the case, because both chains are following the same rules. Do you have a source that explains how all transaction outputs created after the fork are safe?










As I understand it, he would send himself his pre-fork corns, the transaction would be replayed on the other chain, but then, if he were to spend his coins **again** on either chain, that transaction could be broadcast to the other network, moving the correlating opposite fork's coins to the correlating other fork's recipient, w/o the owner's consent.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:50:03
My impression is that you would still have the option to run a full node if you wanted to invest the time, effort, and money. It just wouldn't be *necessary* because the trustlessness of the system is based on Proof of Work algorithm, aka mining, not on the prevalence of nodes.
Any mining entity that tries to screw the system will have his "work" rejected by the rest of the network unless that mining entity has more than 51% of all the hashpower in the world. If my understanding is correct, nodes don't come into play at all and, as long as the **hashpower** isn't *extremely* centralized, then SPV wallets are fully trustless. Anyone who really really wants to run a node can try, but there's no reason to worry about regular users not being able to run one.

Given their qualification in the post, when they say "We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin" they aren't really contradicting the first two are they?
The first two are talking about following the fork, as in, right as it happens. The third is talking about a "determination ... once we believe the forks are in a stable state." Also, they may "consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability".

Thanks for your reply. How would Core 0.15.0 "ban" other nodes?
 Do all nodes broadcast their software? Or is it something else in the way they actually interact with the network? (Aside from propogating larger blocks of course. I'm guessing that, once that happens, it would be easy to know to ignore that specific node.)
Also, what do you mean by btc1 "spoofing their nodes"?

There's more to it than liking the "original" vs the "new" one. You could argue that someone who values the original Ethereum would actually be more likely to value the "new" bitcoin, or at least one that scales on-chain. You could also argue, instead, that the "new" bitcoin is actually more-so the "original Bitcoin" than what we're calling the original, and get the same result.

They don't really have a purpose if you're not mining. The idea of a "non-mining node" being good for the health of the network is, as I understand it, at best: an interesting myth that persists because it feels good to feel like you're helping the network without doing actual mining or, at worst (and I don't necessarily think that this is the case): a clever way to convince people that bitcoin shouldn't scale on chain.
It's important to stress that the idea of a "non-mining node" is never mentioned in the White Paper. "Nodes" and "miners" are used interchangeably. The white paper is not the end all be all on what's best for bitcoin of course, but if "full nodes" were such an important part of the equation, it's interesting that in the defining proposition of bitcoin they aren't even mentioned.

Do you think that the current devs aren't paid?
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:13:10


I was only pointing out that to warn against the incentives of other developers would be hypocritical if you didn't know whether there were potential conflicts of interest with the current dev team. (Especially when your original wording made it sound like they work *only* for ideals, and not money.)


Do you know which of those several dozen core contributors have commit access, and whether that group overlaps with the group employed by Blockstream?


Some googling returned this result:
It explains that they only get paid partially in Bitcoin, which weakens the argument that it is in their best interest to "look after" the coin.
That argument is also based on the assumption that they think that the things that they're doing are in the coins best interest **for good reasons**. They could be honestly convinced of it, but still have been led to that conclusion by a conflict of interest. If you want something to be true, it's easy to convince yourself of it.


That doesn't mean that [one hundred and twenty six million dollars]( in funding couldn't introduce a conflict of interest where there wasn't one before.


How do you feel about Blockstream's business model? My understanding is that Blockstream has patents on sidechain technologies. Sidechain technologies are most useful when the main chain is slow and expensive, which is the case when the blocks are full. Is that not a conflict of interest right there? They argue that they want to keep blocks full for a fee market and keep them small for decentralization, but can we **trust** that they actually believe that themselves when they also stand to gain from full blocks?
Sidechain technologies are also only useful if malleability is fixed, which segwit does. It's argued that segwit was implemented because it was an "effective block size increase" that was also only a soft fork. But can we trust that their intent was to increase transaction throughput when it also enabled the technology on which they have patents and are receiving funding to develop?

Definitely **not** how it works. One could do more work than anybody anywhere has ever done politically, and still not get the leader they wanted, let alone one they deserve.

He did say


So even if he didn't consider specifically the possibility of application specific integrated circuits, he did consider the possibility for needing "specialized hardware", which he does seem to recognize would "raise barriers to entry for mining".
You could argue that being able to CPU mine opens up Bitcoin to a whole different kind of attack where a virus could infect thousands of computers and easily perform a 51% attack against the rest of the network. At least with ASiC's one needs to invest in the future price of bitcoin to mine it.
Around two years ago I invested in an Antminer S3, which was/is hardly "profitable" electricity-wise now but, since I HODL, I'm confident that it will pay off 100 fold by the end. I would recommend an older, less expensive (less hash/dollar) mining rig to anyone who doesn't have $3000 dollars but wants to invest in the decentralization of Bitcoin and plans holding for the long term (so that the worse hash/watt doesn't matter as long as the price keeps going up).

How would nodes do that?


You don't have to trust an institution as long as you trust the system that governs them which, in the case of bitcoin, is the proof of work algorithm and blockchain. The system creates an environment where, unless you have more than 50% of the hashpower in the whole world, it is *not to your benefit* to try to screw everyone else out of their coins. The claim gets rejected, no money is awarded for the "work" done mining false transactions, and electricity is completely wasted.


The verification of transactions is the **job** of the miners in the system and, as long as your wallet follows the longest chain (which is how SPV wallets operate, as I understand them), then it is following the chain that has had the most work done *veryfying* its transactions already, which is the reason you *can* trust the chain, outside of a 51% attack. Could you explain to me how a node helps a user "verify" transactions?

If 2X isn't going to, and it would allow users to dump more safely and protect bitcoin, is there a reason Core doesn't add its own replay protection? Seems worth the benefit to the users.

Several Core devs are founding members of [blockstream]( which has raised [$126 Million]( in funding from investors.
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:53:42


This kind of does sound like an attack. Why go out of your way to make any node planning on forking have a hard time connecting to the network **before** they fork? Until the fork happens, they are both valid nodes on the same network, right?
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:02:26


So you're arguing that, since 2X developers are forcing Core nodes to be a part of their network, they would copy it's replay protection, right? But wouldn't that fork them away from other developers' 2X compatible wallets? Like unlimited, classic, etc? Wouldn't all the other implementations that are compatible with 2X have to also follow core's replay protection at the same time, else there will be even *more* forks?
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:11:18


You might be interested in these quotes, which are from Satoshi:






(Note that when he says "node", he means mining node specifically. Apparently the idea of a non-mining node is not included in the whitepaper, and I'm not sure when it became a thing.)
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:55:48
As I understand it, you don't need the private key of a receiving address or sending address to broadcast that *exact same transaction* on a compatible (non-relay protected) forked network because both chains of a fork work with the same starting data and, if neither changed too much (or added relay protection), signatures that prove a valid transaction was initiated on one chain would prove it in the other, as far as the cryptography is concerned.
Seems like it can **only get sent to the *same address* on the other chain** though, which is less scary. I don't know how exactly a real-life example of an attack would look but I guess you could intend to sell someone your 2x Bitcoin, and then they could steal your NO2X Bitcoin. (But as long as, if you don't want to "use" it, you just ignore the existence of the other fork, I guess you should be safe. I'm no expert though, for the record.)
I think there might be some confusion about the idea of a fork being a **totally separate thing that gives you an equal amount of that fork's coin**. Without relay protection, the network (which in at least some ways defines Bitcoin) should include all wallets and nodes of both forks, since each's transactions are valid on the other's network. From that perspective, it would be silly to expect to be able to sell off one "fork's coin", because it would be doing the *exact same thing* as selling "your fork's" coin.

I'd look into which of the **current** developers with commit access are paid, and by which companies, and who funds those companies, before making any claims contrasting those developers' incentives with the incentives of other development teams.

Just because it's normal to restrict commits to a few members doesn't mean that having that commit access doesn't give you more power/influence.


Could you elaborate on the process you're describing? Are you suggesting that it's somehow democratic? That those with commiter access commit whatever is agreed upon by people in online forums? If so, how do they decide when something has been "agreed upon"? It seems like it would still come down to whether those with **commit access** could agree.


Obviously. But they could easily prevent code from getting implemented by preventing consensus, right? And play a big part in deciding what solutions to what problems **do** make it into the code?




I was only arguing the very specific point that, even if someone honestly believes something is good for Bitcoin, it should still be questioned especially critically if they stand to gain from that same thing. Blocksize is a good example though.


Do you have a source for that? Which of them are on record, and which of that group are Core devs/contributors with commit access?
Even still, not having yet received funding to do something yet doesn't mean that they didn't plan to profit off of the idea long term, in which case of course they are going to hold the same views. I'm not necessarily implying that that's the case, only that having the same views before doesn't mean much in their defense.


I haven't argued that. I've only argued that the current developers who are employed by blockstream have a conflict of interest, and that they have the potential to affect which code does and doesn't make it into Bitcoin.


What does that mean, use for defensive purposes? Sounds like a lot of trust to put in such a small group, especially when it comes to developing a system that's supposed to be trustless.


There wouldn't be an evidence until there was an opportunity for them to go back on their word, would there? So the fact that there's been no evidence to the contrary means nothing.


I believe that you believe it, but do you have any links or sources that you think might convince me? Hearing that "there are many", followed by you listing one, isn't convincing. As far as rootstock goes, doesn't Bitcoin itself have the potential for smart contracts? In which case sidechain smart contracts would only be necessary if it were cheaper to do it off chain than on?




I didn't ask if it was relevant to you. I asked if you thought that we could trust that the employees of Blockstream to rationally come to the conclusion when they stand to gain personally. Seems like the answer is no. And of course, that doesn't imply directly that they're wrong. Just that it's a potential conflict of interest in developers funded by Blockstream, which is what this conversation started with.


Same as above, I wasn't directly challenging segwit. (I do think that it was a bad idea and, if you're curious as to why, I'd be happy to get into it, but that's not what I was talking about.) What I was talking about was whether we could trust that Blockstream employees to rationally come to the conclusion that segwit was the best solution when they stood to gain from implementing it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:22:15
I read it that way too but, now that I'm going back, it's really only the fact that they *don't* talk about their accumulated difficulty decision that makes it seem like the names they were suggesting wouldn't be temporary.
Not that I don't think that these two posts were bad form on their part. I just find it plausible that they're not flip flopping and, instead, should have just included the info from the second post in the first one.


I think that the bigger issue is that, even though they apparently consider it at least remotely likely enough that 2x will be the dominant chain, they still decided to refer to the incumbent chain as simply "bitcoin". If they think that the split could go either way, and that either one could end up being called "bitcoin", then they should have not given either side of the fork the name "bitcoin" by default.
If there's that much uncertainty, then "Bitcoin1x" and "Bitcoin2x" would have sufficed, and then it would be easy to say "Ok, we couldn't be sure before but, now that the Xx chain has clearly won out, we are going to refer to it just as bitcoin." Instead, they opened themselves up for some serious confusion if 2x wins out, without saving much effort if the incumbent chain wins out.
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:40:36
Miners will mine transactions that follow the rules of their software and, if there are miners running two different rulesets, then the chain will split into two versions when one of them breaks the other's rules.
Without replay protection, though, transactions occurring on one chain will still be valid on the other, so it's in 2X's favor (and makes sense, given that they'd argue that 2X is the *real bitcoin*) to have their nodes continue to accept transactions made by *everyone*, whether or not that person intended for that transaction to be (or not to be) included on a specific fork's chain. If the 2X chain wins out, more people who were sending and receiving bitcoin on the 1X chain will have sent and received it on the 2X chain.
It's in their interest to stay hooked up to everyone because they aren't trying to fork **away** from Bitcoin, they are trying to fork and **become** (remain, whatever) Bitcoin, and the more people's transactions 2X clients keep up with, the more they can argue that that's the case.

If you're willing to take the time to summarize: what would I learn from looking at the commits and developer discussion?

Unless you know specifically of a few threads I should check out?
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:32:11
Thanks for taking the time! 


I thought that the cash fork had relay protection, so that their nodes wouldn't constantly be hitting core nodes. Was that not the case?


I'm afraid I don't follow. What resources would be wasted if the two chains' nodes accepted the same transactions? If you're arguing that it's disk space, the blocksize will still be 1MB for the No2X chain, right? So as long as that limit is in place, we shouldn't have to worry about disk space, should we? Don't we need full blocks for a fee market anyway?
Maybe this is crazy talk, but moving coins on both chains by default actually sounds like a desirable outcome, since people who followed the other chain but had to abandon it when it crashed and burned could come flocking back to the other implementation that had been following their transactions all along, and **survived**.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:45:34
Without replay protection, how does  work? How do you create a transaction intended for one network and not the other if the transaction formats are the same? (Maybe more technically correct: How does each network manage not to talk to the another if they are using the same protocol?)
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:58:58
Don't they only diverge completely if there is replay protection? Otherwise, even with two different chains, a transaction could be valid on both, right?
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:33:07
And the coins which were in the pre-fork chain are almost all of them, right? Coins which are mined after the fork are safe, but all others, once spent on one network, can be spent on the other network?
