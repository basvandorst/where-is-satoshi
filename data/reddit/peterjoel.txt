@_date: 2014-03-05 22:54:01


Not really. Someone may correct me here, but my understanding is that the hijacker would still have to mine blocks at the same difficulty as the rest of the network, or else the merchant's wallet wouldn't accept them. Which would mean mining *extremely* slowly or having similar hashing power as the rest of the network. This would be a form of 51% attack. But, if he had that much power, he would be probably better off earning his mining reward rather than trying to defraud anyone.


Part of the point of having miners is that there are *lots* of them, who can't possibly know what the transactions are that they are confirming, having negligible chance of being able to mine a specific block that contains a particular transaction. This protects us. If you could choose which blocks you mined, you could commit fraud.


Only if your fees are already so low that miners are ignoring the transactions. Increasing the fee past the point where miners will accept them is just giving them free money.

Converting back to BTC will probably make you a decent profit right now. Whatever you do, you're essentially betting on whether it will be easier to get USD or BTC out in the future.

Normally you don't have to wait for a block to be mined. You would have to be damn fast - and be in control of most of the peers that are connected to the merchant's wallet - to be able to pull off a double-spend. Of course, it's *a lot* harder to get a double-spend to be included in a mined block - which would involve mining a block - and incomprehensibly harder to get it included in 6 consecutive blocks - which would involve mining 6 consecutive blocks. Still, locally propagating a double-spend is *definitely* harder than using a stolen credit card.
Using a direct transaction, skipping the p2p network, it is *trivial* to double-spend, but the network will reject it very quickly. For tiny amounts; a coffee or a beer; the retailer doesn't lose much in the cases where a double-spend works and, you'll mostly have confirmation from the network before the customer has left the building. It isn't worth the risk for the customer to try it. For slightly larger amounts - a restaurant bill - wait for the network to propagate the payment before accepting the transaction. For even larger amounts, or where fraud is a real risk, allow one actual confirmation. For life-changing amounts, require 6.

True enough, but... 10x 1min confirmations will have a lot less variance in actual time taken than 1x 10 min. The example of waiting 50 minutes for a single 10 minute confirmation is WAAAAAY more likely than waiting 50 minutes for ten 1 minute confirmations.

Also, consider a scenario where the internet connection is disrupted. This actually happens all the time in bars and restaurants, where their card-readers can't connect. With a credit card transaction, the merchant has to say, sorry, I can't take your payment. And he loses a potential sale. In a restaurant, the customer has to wait around for it to be fixed, or go get cash.
With NFC/bluetooth, in the same scenario, the merchant can just *decide to trust you*. When the network comes back, it will be confirmed. If you defraud him, he had the choice to take that chance.

But let's say I'm in China, where the trainers are 120mbtc. But the trader does a lot of business in the USA so these coins are inconvenient. Even if he only trades locally, maybe his supplier or someone else down the line won't accept them, so they are worth less to him. He's going to charge me a premium for the inconvenience of potentially not being able to spend them.

This is not a standard situation. Standard would be if Bitcoin was owned by a corporation that hired people into these roles.

Can you provide links to any of the horror stories? It's news to me.

Dominatrix Joy and Masochists Knots.
Don't let me down now. If I enjoy either one of them, I'll be suing.

I just bought some. This had better be truly fucking awful.

I guess you transfer any balances out of there and then stop using it?

The Bitcoin Foundation does not help improve its image problem by giving people titles like "Executive Director".

Go for the Pure Italian. It's just licorice and nothing else. Nice and bitter. A small pellet lasts about 10 minutes, goes great with (or before) an espresso.

I agree. I have no idea who Garza is, but I consider myself relatively well informed on Bitcoin and general cryptocurrency/blockchain developments. 
I never used paybase, and I would like to think I would do some research before putting money on the line, but it's a name I've seen around. When you see a name in the background, in the same context as things you trust, your trust in it grows. This is how advertising works.

It isn't about the year exactly. It's about having your 15 year old kid/nephew/friend's kid make your website. 
1997 was probably the last time a company used a 15 year old to create a professional online presence.

Ok, so if I was planning to build a blockchain application, I could buy some Veritas and use it to pay you for consultancy services?
Why wouldn't I just pay you in cash, bitcoin or whatever else?

Um. I guess I'll wait then?

When people buy hashing power on cex.io it adds *nothing* to ghash.io - you can buy because someone else sold. 
When ghash.io adds new hashing power, it may or may not sell that on cex.io to its customers.

Actually it says "bitcoins and euros are safe", but I also have a lot of GBP in there.

Right now, I think it's completely comfortable for governments if we pay taxes on any increase in value, at the point of conversion into fiat.
It will get uncomfortable, when we find we don't need to convert back into fiat because we can buy what we need in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:16:31
Because the actual number if pools doesn't matter - ghash.io can just manage 1000 small pools but still have the power because they are controlling all of them. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:46:05
It's complicated when your customer demands to be reimbursed in Bitcoin because they paid in Bitcoin, but you've already converted it to USD and Bitcoin has doubled in value in the meantime.

Have you thought about how you'll handle returns for unwanted goods?
I guess this is completely different depending on whether you are immediately converting the BTC to USD or keeping the BTC.
If you are immediately converting BTC into USD via coinbase, you risk the BTC price being much higher. Would you just refund the equivalent USD instead?
But if you keep them as Bitcoin, and if the price goes up significantly, then your customer has added incentive to ask for a refund, because he can get back the value that he "would have had".
However you have decided, you should make the policy very clear, to avoid unpleasantness further down the line.

I was verified next day. Deposit (EUR from UK bank) was in there the day after. All good. But... Volume is so low, it's painful.

Ok. So in the scenario where they take down the server, I still have all the necessary keys on my machine?

Maybe fix it, maybe just move the same problem somewhere else.

Yes. I'm an idiot. Had the chart in GBP.

It was pretty quick (2 hours) to transfer GBP from my bank to bitcoin-central. However, I was charged £15 by my bank and a further £17 by bcCentral's bank. I think that's because I transfered GBP instead of EUR. I'm transferring EUR next time, so hopefully will only get hit with one charge.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:29:54
I've worked for a few banks. No bank enforces that its employees or contractors cannot buy or sell a currency. That would be stupid: "erm, I know you're going to Germany next week, but you're fired if you try to change GBP into EUR."

No. Do it or it didn't happen

yeah I'm not really too worried. But I thought someone might have more info than is published on the site.

You're doing it wrong! Use Electrum or any other *modern* client. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:50:43
Yeah I've seen the splash page. Wondering if there is anyone here who might have more specific information on what actually happened.
@_date: 2013-03-03 04:58:46
Any data available on that?
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:37:50
Ok thanks. The FAQ suggests otherwise. But I couldn't believe it would work like that. 




So this is vastly misleading. If you put a buy order for $50 instead of $5, then you'll end up buying at $5.50 or something, depending on market depth and spread.

I'm curious. If I was to open a EUR bank account and then convert and transfer £200k from my GBP account into it. Then later, EUR/GBP has increased 10% in value, I move it back with a £20k profit, would I have to pay tax on that?
And if I did the same thing but made a £20k loss, would I be able to claim tax back?
