Good news, the quicker we have a scaling solution &amp; peace for our time, the better.

"pay only with BTC to live free"
It sounds like you sell BTC for essential commodities...

Supply is fixed so the only determinant of price is demand. Somebody for whatever reason demanded more bitcoin.

The only mention of malware on that page is a duplicate issue. Supporting one side or other in a proposed hard fork does not make a wallet malware.
This is needless scaremongering. The BCH fork proved the resilience of the blockchain to minority forks - when the 8% not backing segwit2x become a minority chain, everything will be fine.

Peace for our time. May the best scaling coin hodl forever moar.

The accusations of being a pre-mined s***coin would have been deafening. It was a conscious choice.

Why would we need a HF fix? The 20% emergency difficulty reduction is there as a failsafe on the BCH chain. If the BTC chain has a problem with the hashrate volatility then they can HF their own chain.

Unless they sacrifice some principles to force it through. It will be interesting to see how it unfolds.

Your timing was impeccable :)

I lurk in the_donald, having a basic knowledge of bitcoin - have only just started actively following. I think you're right that there's a huge segment of potential bitcoin advocates just waiting to be converted.
I think passing segwit and ending the (clearly bitter) conflict over Bitcoin Unlimited and the argued 'price control' will make it more welcoming for them though.

Mexicans must feel pretty hard done too. Suddenly their currency is being devalued and they nor their politicians are to blame.
It would certainly push me over the edge at least.

I agree but I'm thinking of the hypothetical were the fiat currencies go into terminal decline and governments have to learn to adapt to a cryptocurrency.
Or are we...

More people having an interest in it being a success seems like a good thing to me.

There won't be a non-contentious emergency hardfork. 
So it's far too risky, just like the 2x hardfork.

Do any taxes remain viable? VAT maybe?
I can see income tax and payroll being worked around (provided with some method to make non-anonymous transactions possibly), although wealth taxes becomes intractable.

Coinbase goes down when the price goes down.
