Could you clarify what you mean by the bad banks?  I see people talking about their accounts being suspended, suspended for what?  Purchasing crypto?  Transferring their crypto assets back to fiat?  ELI5 if you could, please.

Not referring to the gox coins, blacklisting the gox coins is not the right thing to do.  I'm speaking on the general statement of "blacklisting coins is dumb".


Allowing stolen coins to freely flow is a shit idea.  If you want more adoption, we as a community, need to self-regulate.  Letting it be the "wild-west" only draws more and more negative attention until the inevitable ham-fisted government "intervention".

You're welcome.  Stay safe, bookmark the page of the exchange you choose and never navigate to it through a google search.  That's an easy way to get phished.  Enable 2 factor authentication wherever possible, write down the recovery seeds on a piece of paper and put them somewhere safe(but no so safe that you'll forget where you put them).  Do not take pictures of your recovery seeds on your phone, WRITE IT DOWN.  Yes that 50 character string, write it down with nice writing.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:24:46
Sure.  I suggested the crypto community come together and find a way to recover/flag stolen coins rather than hoping the government will help you in that situation.

In a civilized society we pay for things we sometimes do not use.  I do not use public transport, yet I pay for it.  What if I don't have a car, why the fuck should I pay for your roads if I don't use them?  If you don't want the bill for that, build yourself an island in the the middle of the ocean and I can guarantee you you'll pay for no abortions.
Do you take public transport?  Or do you own a car?  Or both?  Unless you live on the fucking moon, someone is paying for something they don't use and you do.

He doesn't like that the peasants are getting restless and the opportunity to give banks the middle finger is getting closer and closer.  
Their business model is built around exploiting people through cheap labor and every person that goes their own way through crypto weakens their hold.  An independent individual is their biggest fucking nightmare.  A person that doesn't need their shitty job they offer for pennies on the hour, or doesn't need their banks is someone you can't control.  That's *scary*.
Charlie boy, I'm gonna continue trading my *baby brains* and you can go merrily fuck yourself because there's NOTHING you can do about it.

@_date: 2018-05-20 19:13:02


Me saying I don't give a fuck if someone gets an abortion does not equate to me deciding that someone WILL have an abortion.  It means I leave it up to the individual making that decision, and not decide for them.  You are trying to make  a decision for them.  Mental gymnastics failed.
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:00:04
Of course it's a slippery slope, but if you think doing absolutely nothing is the right answer, then there's not much else to discuss.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:53:19


Good thing bitcoin made getting those even easier.  Until you realize it's not up to you to dictate who and how someone gets an abortion, you'll receive less and less support from a large number of people who have NO love for the left, but can't stand the ridiculous idiocy of opposing abortions.  
Your kind wants small government(as do I), but they want that small government to mandate against what YOU don't like with impunity, but as soon as that same tactic is used against you it's "big gubmint interfering with citizens".

Tether doesn't have you the least bit worried? I don't mean " the world is going to implode and we're all going to die" sort of worried, but a bit of skepticism is healthy.  Just sayin'.
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:42:14


Not quite. I certainly found the story uplifting.  If you read between the lines, BTC helped this person move away from suicide and into a headspace that would allow them to live the life they want.  To you, it means fuck all, to them it means more than you could ever imagine.

localbitcoins.com or a reputable exchange.  Coinbase is the easiest.  Make sure you read everything you hit "I agree" on.  Be prepared to authenticate yourself when using an exchange.  This is known as "know your customer(kyc for short)".
If you're going to be hodling for a  long time, look at a hardware wallet(Trezor/Ledger Nano), pending the value of your investment.
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:33:37
No one knows what BTC will do.  Anyone claiming otherwise, is bullshitting.  
The only thing that can be said with *certainty* is that BTC will go up, down or trade sideways.

Look I appreciate the write-up and the effort you put in the post.  As someone who's invested in bitcoin, I have learnt to glance at TAs and gather information, but in the end, no matter how many triangles you draw, you can't take into account the human factor and herd mentality.  In the end, it's a bet.  I've come to terms with it a long time ago.  
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:09:05
A really good bet is not to take financial advice from a stranger on Reddit ;).  Make your own decisions and try to at least explain(to yourself) why you made those decisions.

You "borrow" a bitcoin which you sell to the market.  The market goes down and you "buy back" the btc you sold at a lower price, thusly making profit.  One huge issue with shorting is that there's no ceiling.  The price could, theoretically, rise forever costing you more and more to buy back what you sold in the first place. That's why you hear the term "margin call".  That happens when you're exhausting the equity in your account to be able to cover what you need to pay back.  Thinking reversely, during a long(hoping price increases) the price could only fall to 0.

It's inevitable.  Every day you've got nocoiners showing up with "great" advice, weak hands proclaiming they want to see "slow steady growth"(try stocks?) because they physically can't handle it, and my favorite, ones who can't afford it and take every opportunity to revel in anyone's misfortune. 
I love crypto though.  There's nothing else I'd rather be doing.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:17:40
So you're saying bitcoin could go up, down or stay at the same price?  Brb, I need to analyze this new piece of information.  This is groundbreaking.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:05:14
Exchanges that offer margin trading have their own coin stocks to facilitate this.  Obviously you understand you pay a fee to use this feature over and above regular trading fees.  Secondly, there are programs in place for holders to lend their coins to interested parties(see blockonomi.com/bitcoin-lending).
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:20:37
Maybe it will go in the negative too.  When you buy BTC it will automatically credit your account AND give you the coin.  
These are great days we're living bros.  We're jolly green giants, walking the Earth, with guns.

Maybe it's those same ones that called for 20k when it was 6k back in November.  Truth is, you'll either bet on BTC and ride, or you'll become an "expert" on the sidelines squawking "I told you so" on every dip.  It's been a hilarious ride.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:56:45


There's also knowing when to "stop buying the dip" and not become overinvested.  To each their own, and it's not my place to tell you what to do with your dollarydoos, and as such you may ignore that piece of advice.
