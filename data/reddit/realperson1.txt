I can't find the link now. I found it from here:
A month ago or so the Canadian Minister of Defense confirmed 4 different species of aliens inhabiting the planet and also confirms the major players of the New World Order. Pretty fucking amazing

I've transferred USD from Dwolla into my checking account plenty of times.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:22:04
I sent them an email.... I'll see what they say. They are usually pretty good at responding fairly quickly. Thanks!

That's awesome! So it will always be 21,000,000.00000000 max, but the decimal places could increase. 
This is so sick! So glad I know about these. 
Hopefully the Fed and government doesn't figure out a way to shut it down... because it would be in there best interest to shut it down, but F em'

OKay, pretend I never mentioned SR..
Are you talking about Funding Method on mtgox?
I just need one of those long address codes and then I can transfer to mtgox.
All I see is Dwolla etc

I'm still kind of a noob at Bitcoins.... so 100% there is a cap on Bitcoins? Any idea what that number is?  Can it ever split or more added?
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:55:58
All I hear is good news about Bitcoins... in the mainstream media... good luck to you sir

I know what limit orders are. I day trade with Ameritrade. I'm just new to Bitcoins and how that's done, dick.

Been trying to learn about the source of the Bitcoin... there is none. No one knows.
I've read from a few different hackers and watched a few videos about the source of this Bitcoin code. They all say the same thing... no one knows who wrote it or where it came from... and it's encryption is like something they've never seen before. It's impossible to break they say. It's encryption is 1000x or more what a normal bank's encryption is. They all say it's otherworldly.
Just sounds interesting to me and I want to learn more...
Reason being... what if it's true. What if this is from another planet?
I mean seriously, with the Fed, Cyprus, everything going on with all the monetary problems out there with inflation and corruption.... The Bitcoin could replace EVERYTHING. Maybe it's like a gift from another planet to save our own planet.
Just thinking...

Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-14 23:03:06
Oh... that's why I have this pending deposit from my bank account into Dwolla that I can't view or delete
So, any recommendations for a new Dwolla to use?
My bank account -&gt; New Dwolla - &gt; Mtgox

Having sex with my dead grandma who was cremated would be impossible.
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:50:49
Ok, so that makes sense... 
But what if they start shutting down sites like  and others.
What if they start shutting down the sites that provide the wallets and addresses?
Then what? 
The way Bitcoins work seems to good to be true... and it would totally cut out banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, the Federal reserve etc etc etc... and those are some of the most powerful institutions in the world. So whose to say they can't do what I just suggested?
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:58:54
My theory on this is people buying on the Silk Road all late
Then the actual investors take over starting at 7am... and lowest usually is around 9am
So, you could just do this everyday. Obviously there is those weird days like just recently, but I think that could be over. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:56:26
I have a description?
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:31:42
That's it!
No I have no problem doing that with Dwolla, thanks though.
My intent is to keep the Bitcoins at Mtgox
I forgot I had BTC at SR ha
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:53:10
Oooh, good one. But while she was alive she only had sex with one person her entire life, my awesome grandpa RIP
She would NEVER have sex with anyone else, ever.
So, then you're implying that someone could travel back in time and fuck my grandma. I don't think so. That would be impossible.

The lesson I'm learning is that I want to learn how to do DDOS attacks

I like my claim better

You're the one saying penis and calling people pigs.
I was just talking about smoking a cigarette. 
People from Great Britain are weird.
@_date: 2013-07-30 10:43:28
Interesting. Yeah, my current thing is just collecting as many as possible no matter at what price. It's all money I can lose so I'm not selling at any price. 
If you take the total money USD out there in the world (10.5 trillion according to the FED - probably bullshit, but that is their numbers) then divide 21 million (number of bitcoins that will ever be available)... that puts the price at $500k per
I know that is a crazy number. But that would be the price if the NWO or anyone controls all the US currency and gets rid of all our paper money.

Transaction fees with mtgox are like $0.50 USD... it's like nothing. I'm playing with under $1000 and all my buy and sell orders go through the second I put them in
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:01:59
How do you put in limit orders with mtgox?
@_date: 2013-07-30 00:10:38
So then the answer is no... but more than one entity could rule all?
What if that one 12 million dollar buy by the the Winklevoss twins is one of a few small "large" buys.... the last etitny could drive the price up high enough for everyone to sell and then they control the market. Just an idea...
I guess if a "New World Order" did occur, they would probably create their own currency.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:05:17
If you're just buying for the Silk Road, it doesn't matter what the price is. Buy the Bitcoins, transfer to SR, buy your ish.... you have the same USD to spend. It just gets fucked when you hold onto your Bitcoins buying at a high point.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:05:12
I yeah, I wrote vagina. That's a funny word.
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:07:53
Thanks for the response.
As for bitcoin-qt... Which is what I have currently actually as my wallet
Wouldn't they be able to shut that down to or make that source code stop working?
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:04:09
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:22:18
Let me know... thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:46:52
Thanks for being a dick since I'm new at this
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:32:55
Really concerned about the Fed though... how would they do it if they were to? Any thoughts? 
I'm a big Ron Paul fan and the Fed needs to go and that's why I love the idea of Bitcoins... but there is no way those bastards wouldn't figure out a way to shut it down.
So, just saying, maybe there is a way to already start to prepare for it or prevent it
just talking out loud...
@_date: 2013-04-30 08:30:47
Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-10 11:59:17
I want 730 Bitcoins  :(
@_date: 2013-07-30 10:46:14
Did you see that amazing shit that got announced by Canada?
I hope you have seen this and it's posted somewhere...
Canadian Minister of Defense confirms 4 different species of aliens inhabiting the planet and also confirms the major players of the New World Order. Pretty fucking amazing
