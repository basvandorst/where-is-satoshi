Eth Price rise ? It's been falling since about a month now or a bit more. Still in a big rise over past year though.

Is coinbase really secure/ safe? Is the wallet stored on my iPhone?

I've got a question not related to bitcoins but related to the chrome://extensions tab
I have some sort of adware on my laptop right now and I can't find it when I try and go and uninstall a program (under control panel). I never got the ads when I was in firefox or edge, and still didn't get them when I set firefox as my main browser (making me jump to the conclusion that the adware is not installed as some sort of exe somewhere). 
So it must be a hidden extension in Google Chrome. Do you know if there is a way to hide or rather unhide extensions? 
EDIT: I just updated google chrome, and now there isn't an about part anymore on the sidebar of chrome://extensions

So that means my bitcoins can't be stolen ? But I can cash it out at any time ?

The screenshot looks out of CoinBase.

Oh right okay, that makes sense. Thanks! I have a work colleague who had a bitcoin on  and he had ~0.4BTC stolen from him in Mt. Gox. It's what got me interested in this whole Bitcoin stuff. 
okay, so if I buy/sell bitcoins in the coinbase app, am I doing the tx with other coinbase users? It is only once I purchase something using btc does the tx fee happen. Is that correct?
