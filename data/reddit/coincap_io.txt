It'll be interesting to see how Circle deals with it as they allow more beta testers in. Can't believe they didn't consider the backlash this might cause
@_date: 2014-07-05 05:25:51
Pretty standard for youtube comments. Really does go to show the ignorance of people about bitcoin right now. Really odd the amount of vitriol and hate.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:26:35
look out for the barter system too 
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:25:21
actually, automobile needs horse-ebooks

TIL imgur has a premium account

Hollywood timeline vs tech timelines...there is nothing in this world that is further apart. Trying to make them meet is a terrible idea. Had they released it independently, at least it could have had a bit of a groundswell from the people who actually support its release (the internet). Play to your audience, let them make noise, people will hear the noise and wonder what's going on. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:37:43
If nothing else, its a good opportunity for those who really believe in its longterm effects to stock up. There's way more to this than just the price.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:48:40
Might be an underrated move. Quick Books is an industry staple and isn't exactly going away, this bodes well for wider Bitcoin acceptance.
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:32:40
A bargain at twice the price!
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:12:44
This will really be the only way to know if this is legit or not. If he turns up on news outlets, with a name and a face, then maybe there's something here, but outside of that there's way too many holes for me.
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:05:01
So...when's the talk going to stop and movement start to happen?
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:00:41
Isn't this the definition of "disruptive technology"?
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:25:30
Did the same. This would be a nice feather in the ole bitcoin cap.
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:21:23
Agreed, bitcoin will always be a harder sell in places where fiat has a seemingly stronger hold and there is a semblance of hierarchy and organization. Appearances are always deceiving.
@_date: 2014-09-03 02:05:26
This is a shameful rate, particularly when you consider who they are taking these fees from. Insane.
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:37:34
Its true, if you have the interest/capital to dive into crypto at all, now is the time to play with the idea. But looking at the daily ups and downs (as with any long-term investment) isn't a great idea.
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:28:26
Don't have a great feeling about this for this exact reason.
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:56:11
Huge fan of it for the same reasons, well put
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:08:15
Absolutely love this. Love the functionality and especially the onename integration. Awesome! Well done guys!
@_date: 2014-09-03 02:10:03
Very cool stuff! Will absolutely be giving this a try :) 
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:56:25
Couldn't agree more. Its the natural next step in connecting current payment system and crypto/btc. Its a process of linking it all together. ApplePay is very much a concept that can help.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:33:30
This is a word that needs to be spread.
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:22:33
Too many people have been at this point.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:44:55
Financial independence from government insanity. Transfer fees may be lower, but the bigger fact of having a competitive alternative and shifting the financial power structure away from government, even a little, can make a huge difference in the long run.
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:46:58
Obviously very early stages, but looks good and often keeping things simple and basic can be the best way. In terms of improvement, add a section such as 'about us' or 'contact us' . Any newcomers to the site need to know they can trust you and being able to contact you or know more about you or the business always helps. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:39:37
Its not about the price. It will always be about the tech and the untethered reach that it can have. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:19:35
definitely a step in the right direction. anyone know where to get a '95 laserjet to go with it?
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:03:34
Most definitely. Especially once you see the potential outside of the financial world for the technology side of it, its pretty exciting
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:55:11
two thumbs up
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:50:51
Exactly. If you're expecting a secure wallet, get off of Xapo. Check into a wallet like Hive where you know for certain you hold private keys. Don't mess with "wallets" that offer anything less. As bitcoin grows, this is going to be a bigger issue for people and companies that don't have their security measures in proper order will be weeded out.
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:24:56
Subway franchises have the potential to be a big catalyst in the bitcoin world, maybe the dominoes will start to fall
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:53:47
This is pretty great. Simple, concise, and delivers exactly what it claims. Well done!
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:50:31
Really nice, accessible entry way into btc. Kind of novel as well.
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:35:03
Really great article. thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:15:28
Agreed, there is no way they would do this without being able to prop up their own brand (PayPal) and use it as a long term play.
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:35:04
Absolutely insane! The USPS can't be trusted with a postcard, let alone thousands of dollars in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:17:34
Totally agree. People see "U.S Mint" and don't separate it from the generally ignorant swath of banks/feds
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:09:19
They really do. Especially with the surge of interest in crypto over the past few months, you'd think that would be motivation enough for them to do something. Hopefully soon...
@_date: 2014-07-05 06:05:03
Thanks for posting this! Great reference piece.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:15:29
Wow, this is interesting...will definitely be checking this out.
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:48:25
This will backfire in an large way for them.
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:37:14
Exactly. And its moving that direction very very quickly. Well past the point of no return.
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:16:55
Agreed, from this point on with exchanges, branding will be a major factor in what sets you apart.
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:28:47
Oh man, Mensa?? There's no way you ever want to mess with those guys. They know everything and you definitely aren't as smart. Just submit to their natural born genius. Its the only way really.
@_date: 2014-07-05 05:43:33
Ah the EBA...they really have their finger on the pulse.
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:35:03
Although the site looks legit, this is definitely a scam. Testimonials alone are not even made so 100% stay clear! : 
Would be great if it was actually true though
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:36:17
So this is how an illustrious and iconic publication covers new and disruptive technology. Awesome. Not dinosauric at all.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:22:06
I would tend to agree, if its gotten this far, they've been working with full intent on playing nice with the SEC in hopes they can walk this all the way to the finish line
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:44:30
Nearly all of these raffle apps are sketchy as is. These are the last people we need in news related to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:51:29
Excellent video, well done!
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:18:47
I mean I would love for this to be true, but seriously how can anyone buy what you're saying when you just throw bullish numbers around. Also...its not about the price! 
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:09:21
Definitely picking one up. Absolutely love the design. Well done!
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:54:51
Come on Capital One..I want my cash back in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:06:15
A must watch for anyone just starting off in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:46:25
They have a very-responsive html5 template website with some beautiful photos. Just gorgeous work.
Seriously though, would be really nice if they would actually do something to capitalize on their seemingly undeserved amount of buzz.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:49:14
Dallas is a perfect place for it and HPB is spot on. Maybe check out The Common Desk (co-working space for startups) in Deep Ellum?
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:41:44
Good news for sure. Rare find under the government umbrella.
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:18:57
The second that decentralization is separated from Bitcoin, they jump right back into the game with the banks, gov, etc. Cowardly is absolutely the word.
@_date: 2014-09-03 02:08:10
Definitely agree with you here. You cannot judge a conference by its price tag and without attending. You have to factor in the moving parts that actually work full time to put this on, not just the speaker fees involved.
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:18:26
"It makes it much harder to govern, makes it much harder to organize people, much harder to find the common interest," &lt;&lt; That right there is the most telling line of all. "Organizing people" and "finding the common interest"...obviously we always need government to help us with both those things. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to think for ourselves and "organize" ourselves.
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:24:27
People will gradually learn more and more about Bitcoin in your area, and until they do, it is always good publicity for you to be the worlds first brewery to accept Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:31:47
Garnish with every meal is essential to the creative process. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:27:51
This definitely doesn't bode well...
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:22:28
Well put, and completely true. The whole point of it is to keep the human greed and error and unnecessary manmade regulation out of it. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:34:13
Companies will throw as much cash as possible to get under the table access to a network of millions. It doesn't matter what medium it is.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:48:21
Will have to check this out. Good for them for adding.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:41:41
A delicious and worthy receiver of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:31:27
You know, you just read your "bitcoin number" over the phone. Its THAT easy! 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:33:46
I think we have the general coverage in the media to blame for that though. Hopefully this changes over time, but right now it is very much an echo chamber in a lot of ways.
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:23:02
This will be a gigantic waste of time and money for them. So good. Let them chase shadows for awhile.
@_date: 2014-08-22 17:59:14
We're clearly right in the middle of entrepreneurial Darwinism
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:29:07
Overthrow is the word. Bitcoin facilitates a new paradigm.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:26:55
So how many people so far have come up and tried to swipe their Bank of America cards and been very confused
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:34:31
There is no doubt that is how they'll attempt to spin this, but the winds are changing on them rapidly. People will see through it. The blowback from this will be enormous...I hope at least.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:12:16
Speculating is an endless catch-22. That isn't changing. I personally feel good about the price going up, this just seems like grandstanding.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:52:06
Definitely an early play by them in trying to garner interest and wait out regulations but looks seemingly legit. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:06:25
At this point this can't be a surprise to anyone. If it is, you're being too naive. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:26:38
Always have to be on the lookout for those damn "shoulder surfers"...close cousin to the Silver Surfer. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 05:13:44
They've probably already spent it all on paying people to "pull it out of the bitcoin atm" for them. They're always a few steps ahead of everyone.
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:43:08
Agreed. He's selling what masses are buying (gold), so he's not going to adjust his stance until he sees a mass shift start to happen and feels the need to sell something new (Bitcoin). Why should he? But that being said, everyone should take his opinions with that in mind.
@_date: 2014-09-09 02:12:36
Now this is something special. Great news for bitcoin today
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:18:04
I wonder if his friends as listed as "Friend 1" and "Friend 2" also
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:04:04
Awesome! Will have to make my way over from Clearwater
@_date: 2014-07-05 05:54:52
Obviously you won't be doing this at 2am again so lesson learned, but seriously this guy is a jackal. I hope he comes to his senses and takes your offer.
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:02:00
Seriously astonishing considering what they could do given their user base. Amazing
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:25:17
Its a game of mercenaries who (along with government officials) have been making a fortune off of making a mockery of democratic process for years. Shady characters at the minimum.
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:40:58
You can see the ether price on CoinCap as well
