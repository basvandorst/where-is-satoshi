It wasn't that Bitmex moved the market, it's that SOMEONE took advantage of Bitmex downtime to manipulate spot markets, so that it would cause mass liquidations on Bitmex, where they likely had a long bet in place.

nice handle!
Interesting that Adam back was suggesting PoW in Hashcash was a "minting" process even though there wasn't a ledger to keep track of it.   Did he assume that hashes of email content had value on their own?  The blockchain accounting system was essential in keeping track of token ownership and making distinct fungible units.
