Way too much! I know it appears to be popular to take investing advice from a meme, but that is a bad idea. The higher the price goes, the smaller should be the proportion of Bitcoin in your net worth. That is because it is perhaps a truism that an investment that has gone up in price is always riskier than it was before the price increase.
Ask yourself: if today all of your net worth was allocated to cash, would you consider it prudent to put 87% of it in Bitcoin? I think the answer is: obviously not. There is something akin to the sunk cost fallacy going on. (A quick search reveals that this has a name: house money effect, which says that people take more and greater risks when investing with profits).

I think this is the most important question anyone in the OP's situation should ask themselves.

Your link goes to an article on window managers. Did you mean to link here?:

When I made my comment, I had in mind the legend of the shoe shine boy giving stock tips before the crash in 1929: 
But more seriously, I've seen some articles that show a connection between consumer confidence and upcoming stock market performance. In short, consumer confidence goes up along with stock market bubbles, and people are most confident about the future right at the peak of hysteria.
But do note (as the article does) that this correlation is far from perfect.
Many people talk about Bitcoin being in a bubble, and I agree to some extent, since the change in value of it isn't really connected to its usage, nor in my opinion to its likelihood of continued success. However, I believe we could see a much more dramatic bubble if Bitcoin can capture the imagination of the masses as it does the fairly small community of current speculators.

I like this strategy, but I think it is incomplete. The other half is, once all the random new people you meet start investing in Bitcoin, it's time to think about selling.
