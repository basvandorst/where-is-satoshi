The basic fact is  even if bitcoin only gets a market cap of gold then bitcoin will be worth $325,000 per coin.
Market cap of gold is a fringe small number. It could go much higher.
We are just in a margin call panic type sell here initialled causedby thetax guidaince given by the irs which had its firstreal impact in april that caused a lot of selling pressure.

They banned positive talk like moon for a year  and left only those who are negative and look what has happened.
People come here to learn and see nothing but negative.
Why would anyone buy?
 Back when people could talk about moon it was fun and gathered many people. Now all the fun ones have left because they cant have fun here and they were the knowledgable enthusiasts and the only ones left are negative smack talkers.

So the first real tax discussions and decparations by irs etc in the us last year forced many big whales to sell to pay taxes. One study shows there are about 30% of coins now in play that had  been locked up by whales.
So of course price fell as april deadline approached.
That started a lot of margin call forced sales and panic selling.
And of course it is harder to get on exchanges at all because of all the verification now. Even bitcoin atms require verification.
So can individual buying be big enough to make big price moves like in the past with those restrictions now?
So the other big question is when will institutional money come in strong. Some already happened.
Of course the big institutional nay sayers like Jamie Dimon have now started saying everyone should have some bitcoin. I dont know if that means they were secretly buying before when they were being negative and are now selling their secret positions to the retail customer or if they are now going to be buying more. Thoughts?

When absolutely everyone thinks its time to sell and its all over, that is the indictor that the bottom has been reached and all fingernail hangerson have been flushed out and its time to buy.
Anyone know of a good sentiment graph or survey for bitcoin?

Gold is a fringe investment that is primarily fueled by people who think the world will end tomorrow and they will need gold bars in their bunkers. Yet it is several trillion in marketcap.

Nothing wrong with it.
I might put it on some of my sites.
