I don’t think Switzerland has social healthcare. However, your argument is still valid.

Ah, makes sense when you break it down like that. Thanks.

 As part of its reallocation away from the  dollar, Russia also bought a  substantial amount of other non-USD  currencies, and according to a [recent report](   the money pulled from the dollar reserves was redistributed to  increase  the share of the euro to 32%, the yuan to 14.7%, and another  14.7% of  the portfolio was invested in other currencies, including the  British  pound (6.3%), Japanese yen (4.5%), as well as Canadian (2.3%)  and  Australian (1%) dollars.
And now, the final missing piece of Russia's massive capital reallocation out of the petrodollars has emerged, after the [Telegraph]( reported that **Moscow is preparing an investment in Bitcoin in a bid to tackle US sanctions,** according to a Russian economist with close ties to the Kremlin.
According  to Vladislav Ginko, an economist at the state-funded  Russian  Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public  Administration, **the  government is taking steps to minimize the  impact of US sanctions that  have hit the Russian rouble by replacing  some of its US dollar  reserves with the world’s most popular  cryptocurrency.**
Quoted by [The Telegraph]( Ginko said he believes Russia’s de-dollarization decision is fundamentally **a   move to "protect its national interests" due to a possible  interruption  of “US nominated payments flows for Russian oil and gas”**  and  claims that the investment in bitcoin could be as much as $10bn   (£7.8bn); a material enough amount to send the price of bitcoin sharply   higher.
When would Russia's next  capital reallocation take place? According  to the Russian economist,  the purchases could start as soon as next  month. Cryptocurrencies have  seen a surge of interest in Russia, where  President Putin has expressed  an interest in the digital assets in  recent months. Ginko believes  Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency  industry now account for 8% of  Russia’s GDP, **and investment to bolster the country’s reserves with Bitcoin could start as soon as February.**
**“\[The\]  Russian government is about to make a step to start  diversifying  financial reserves into Bitcoin since Russia \[is\] forced by  US  sanctions to dump US Treasury bonds and \[take\] back US dollars,”** Ginko said.
