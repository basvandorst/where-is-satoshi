It means you are a thief just like the kid was. You stole from the kids mom. She tried to make it right and you took advantage.
You lost your coins. You only deserve to get your coins back. Not a penny more. The fact you bought them for half price means they were only worth half of what you took from her.
This is why insurance (often) makes you replace the item before they reimburse the receipt/proof of payment. So a little shit thief like you doesn't steal from them.
Do you understand? Or do you still think you did no wrong? You are no better than that rotten kid. You both stole. Worse is you didn't steal from him, you stole from his honest mom.
Redeem yourself and pay her back the excess money.

1) This isn't auto insurance and auto insurance has no relevance to this situation. 
2) If it was insured it would be home insurance. Which doesn't work how you described. 
3) Auto is the exception, not the rule. Not all auto insurance works that way, although I concede that this may have been your experience. And if you didn't notice auto insurance is in a bit of a pickle right now. 
4) There are different ways to insure things that will change how the payout works. Benifiting from an insurance claim goes against the fundamentals of insurance and the principles of indemnity.
5) This isn't insurance. The fact is the kid charges one price and replaced his item for half so he ripped off that guys mom who clearly did nothing but try to right a wrong.

Takes a thief to know a thief.

1) The other posts are right, little late to use regular desktop hardware. Joining a pool will net you nothing. And mining on your own is like playing a hard lottery.
2) It's still good practice. See if you enjoy trying to extract every last ounce of performance from your hardware. 
3) If the power is cheap or free, then maybe it's a cheaper alternative to actually playing the lottery... you never know and might unlock 25 coins or whatever the payout is now. It is random... Million monkeys with a million typewriters random.

The value of gold has never changed in modern times and I wouldn't expect it to start now. Gold is not an investment.

Yes, they are effectively lost forever. It's not impossible for it to be recovered, but that is little more than a theory at this point. 
To answer your other question, it shouldn't matter. Bitcoin was designed to be scarce and was expected to only get more scarce over time.

Done.
