How do you determine btc value without an exchange?
@_date: 2012-11-27 01:09:27
Step 1 - Learn about the technical indicators
Start with MACD as it's the most popular indicator. It's simply the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMA); One long window and the other a short window EMA.
Step 2 - Go find some historic data
Step 3 - Program a trading system 
Implement your technical analysis algos. 
Define parameters such as trigger thresholds, indicator parameters &amp; target markups
Take the historic data as input and push it through your system (backtesting)
Define a fitness function (scoring algo) to rank the result of your simulated trades
Either manually or programmatically vary the parameters and repeat backtesting.
Once your happy with the results, it's ready to enter active trading.
Step 4 - Active trading
Create a live market data capture script (see: mtgox websockets, bitcoincharts.com api, other sources)
Create a trading bot - the part of your system that actually initiates buy/sell orders
Feed the live input to your trade system, once it generates an order at the last input (current price), tell your trade bot to initiate the order. 
Alternatively, implement inverse functions to your indicators to calculate the next price which will trigger a buy order -- this will allow you to get your trade in early and result in less missed opportunities. I've used wolfram alpha in the past to get the inverse function (here's a silly example:  )
Good luck!

Not unless they all had the same idea at once. NO, this was a quick high volume spike selling into a really weak bid market depth.

I just wanted to capture and highlight the behaviour of one bot attempting to manipulate the market. I don't believe this capture shows actual evidence of price manipulation -- just the attempt, however poor it may have been.
I disagree that this isn't layering. The SEC defines layering as “..the use of non-bona fide orders, or orders that the trader does not intend to have executed, to induce others to buy or sell the security at a price not representative of actual supply and demand.” 
We can argue the effectiveness of the captured attempt but this clearly falls under layering. 
Lets be honest here, the order book for bitcoin is overrun with bots. So much so that I would expand your accusation that 'many' of the orders are layered to state that almost all orders are layered with the probability increasing as the price converges towards the spread. I only captured a few minutes of data, if I captured a days worth of data I am confident I could easily show rampant layer ordering. 
To be fair, there is one legitimate justification for setting &amp; resetting bid/ask orders around the spread and that is when one is acting as a market maker/ liquidity provider. The difference is that you must be willing to take the full order..no diving out of the way.  
Bid stuffing, as I'm sure you already know, is the rapid placement and cancelling of orders in an attempt to flood or interfere with competing bots. MtGox at least has a rate limit on the number of orders one account can generate. This bot was bid stuffing near the rate limit.
What I am showing is absolutely intentional. This isn't new, it's been going on for some time. I only got around to recording it today. Even a poor bid stuffing/layering implementation such as this would be effective in manipulating the price, given the right conditions.

Wow, that's ambitious. 
I would've contracted out production to a board house. Now they get to deal with production process and quality issues as they dial in their mini manufacturing line.
@_date: 2012-01-17 22:51:59
Someone dumped a large amount of coins on the market which knocked down the market price quite a bit. This probably had a cascading effect as bots with stop loss functionality triggered sell orders on any open positions dumping even more coins on the market. AKA Flash Crash.
At least that's what my bot tried to do -- Luckily I was at my computer so I intervened and shut the bot down.

To clarify the challenge with using a six foot reflow oven:
SMT reflow ovens have four stages: preheat, soak, reflow, cooling. The temp settings for these stages along with conveyor speed define the temperature profile the PCB will see. 
IC's require a certain temperature profile (including peak temp and temp ramp rates). If you go outside this profile on the low side you can end up with cold solder joints on the high side you can end up with IC delamination &amp; damaged components. These issues, if they occur, may not be immediately apparent (may pass in circuit test / end of line test). 
Ideally, and especially during parameter optimization of the oven, you'll want to test your end product over the entire operating range (voltage &amp; temp) to detect if these types of defects are occurring.
With only a six foot oven, production cycle time will be pretty high. If this reflow oven is the bottleneck, there will be pressure to decrease cycle time by cranking up the conveyor and increasing temps. Their lack of experience in managing manufacturing processes &amp; utilizing quality methods may find them producing product at a low first pass yield and with field reliability issues.
And as product complexity goes up (smaller pitch, non-wetable QFN, BGA) so does the risk.
It's never as simple as buying a bunch of equipment and hiring operators. That's either ignorance or arrogance -- In this case I'm not sure which.

He borrowed 17,000 bitcoins to sell them into the buy spread. Now that he crashed the market he can buy back the 17,000 coins at a lower price. He gets to keep the profit minus any credit fees owed for borrowing the coins.
The risk in short selling is that the price may go up. If this happens you are forced to buy back the coins on credit. 
It's like using your credit card at the casino. You can win more gambling money you really don't have or you can land yourself deep in debt. 
He saw the opportunity with the weak bid spread and went all in.
*edit* The 10:1 means for every $1 in his account he could trade $10. This was his credit. He only needed to afford 1,745 BTC to sell the 17,450 BTC.

Bots can absolutely cancel orders:
@_date: 2012-12-29 00:49:42
On the buy side I believe the strategy is to increase the price. 
If you want to buy BTC you'll need to submit your order above this fake order. The reason I call it a fake order is that it is never intended to be filled. As the market price approaches the fake buy order pulls back.
The reason this is illegal for traditional markets is that the order was never meant to be filled. see: 
@_date: 2012-09-19 18:12:37
@_date: 2012-12-29 00:42:03
I've seen the same behaviour on the sell side too. I'm not sure if this should be called stuffing or layering but in any case it's meant to manipulate the market.
Watching this made me wonder if people realize how much some bots are involved in driving market prices for BTC. And because of the lack of regulation, every dirty trick known is actively being employed.
Full disclosure: I am an author of an automated trade system myself but mine only places 'real' orders. I would like to think my system provides a service as a market maker / liquidity provider to dampen volatility whereas some other bots seem to be focused on manipulation of price.

I'm not sure I understand the question. 
The net worth indicator is a snapshot in time of the then current account balance + (BTC holdings  * the then current market price - commissions).
The reason you see net worth fall is that the system is buying into a dip. I could add a projected net worth indicator based on the projected profit of the trades and adjust it down if targets are not met. Thanks, now I something else to add to the todo list ;)
This is yet another reason to not use final net worth as an indicator of performance in the fitness function. The simulation will almost always end with open positions; Especially if the market is currently in a dip. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:50:46
If price returns to pre-pop trends, the speculators would immediately return.
This isn't all or nothing proposition. The market will continue to determine the value and people will continue to speculate.
When the price does drop, other speculators will pick up BTC at a discount.

While it looks like your getting downvoted, I have to partially agree with you. 
Of course, QE1 &amp; 2 helped gold; That's what gets to happen when you inflate the money supply.
But why does everything have to be black or white? What I mean is why in your opinion would gold &amp; silver have crashed without QE? The market is driven by emotion and, whether they are right or wrong, people are fearful for the future value of the dollar, regardless of QE actions.
Personally, I was in gold at $700-800 and out @ %1500.
A gold/bitcoin exchange only makes sense if your trying to evade the 'collectable' tax.

I just recently finished a naive bayes classifier side project for work. I basically wrote my own version of a $40K software package other divisions within the company I work for bought (along with all our competitors). There was some webpage interface, db, olap reporting and IE automation involved with the project too. I basically, in my own spare time, created a system that smoked the industry standard commercial offering.
My boss told me he couldn't pay me for it and I should figure out a way to sell it on the side. I responded by telling him I never asked him to pay for anything and I was already bored with it anyway. I already figured it out and made a working system, it was dead to me even though I still use it every day at work.
I should also say I am not a programmer; At least not by training or trade. I've never been employed as one and have no desire to be. Just because I'm good at something doesn't mean I care to be exploited for it... I write software for me and me alone.

It's all custom.
1) Data feed script collecting/calculating 1min volume weighted price data using bitcoincharts telnet interface.
2) Technical analysis trade simulator for backtesting and scoring trade strategies
3) Genetic algos for generating the trade strategies
4) GA clients for testing independent genetic populations (I run four instances in parallel.)
5) Gene server to support multiple GA clients
6) Reporting script for generating pretty charts and finding the next buy trigger price
7) Bookie script for placing the GA buy/sell orders, complete with stop loss and stop age capabilities. (1min monitoring for stop loss).
What caught me out on this is that I don't have enough historic data to backtest to. I have a buy_wait variable in the GA code which will throttle the rate at which buy orders are generated. I don't need to change any of my code, because now I have the data -- the system will automatically adapt :)

@_date: 2011-07-08 05:35:53
The gotcha with a simple win/loss ratio is that the GA would probably find the series of trades on the largest historic dip to guarantee a 100% win ratio.
If you change it to profit * win/loss you would find the biggest dip and peak... which may be days apart historically and may not repeat for months in live trading.
My question about the fitness function was really a loaded question. The truth is 99%  of people will get it horribly wrong and completely fail to consider small scale inputs to the fitness function such as (score += markup / 1000000) which will fine tune your 'local optimum'.

Besides the normal process of seed, fitness, selection, &amp; reproduction (crossover, crossover/mutation and self mutating), the tool supports multiple independent populations, best of the best populations &amp; variable mutation rates.
The gene server implements support for many independent populations.
The reporting script generates the simulation charts and calculates the next buy order.
The trade bot is the MTGox automated trade platform. It supports stop loss, stop age, target price and buy order protection (forces any overpriced order to below the current market rate). It outputs a html trade book which tracks the round trip for each order. 
The ga1..5 scripts are the genetic algo trade simulators.
It's still not ready for prime time as the Mt.Gox API is a bit of a bitch. Instantly completed orders never report an order id, partially completed trades are a PITA and MTGox will randomly fault when responding to requests. I've addressed most of the problems but I still need to code up the fix for partially completed orders by splitting the orders within the trade system.
 
This has all been a lot of work. To anyone not familiar with GA, the single most critical part of the system is the fitness (or scoring) function. I've rewritten it at least a dozen times. The issue isn't one of complexity, rather the problem is that what you think it should be is probably not what you really want.
I would be curious to hear how you would score a given trade strategy. Total profit? Sum the profit from each trade divided by age? Win/Loss ratio?

While your point is obvious, it's also wildly unpopular. 
As a currency, bitcoin doesn't make sense...right now. Will it ever? I doubt it. 
For now speculation seems to be driving the price up. Or is it? If you look at price / difficulty, bitcoin valuation begins to make some sense.
Regardless, for bitcoin to operate as a currency will require some level of price stability. Otherwise, pricing in bitcoins will have to be spot adjusted to dollars, euros, etc. Legitimate currencies need to demonstrate stability... I'm not sure bitcoin can do this.
In the meantime there is money to be made...just don't get caught thinking you can retire with an attic full of beanie babies.

@_date: 2011-07-09 07:44:01
Another great idea, thanks!
It wouldn't be too complicated to capture the parent(s) score to calculate the delta. I'll just need to store the delta bias separate from the score. This is a distributed system so I don't want the delta bias included in the scores sent to the server. I would only use it during the selection process within each process (population). I would also have to implement a delta bias decay rate to slowly reduce the bias for each gene over time.

Mt.Gox has demonstrated trade volume and instability. It's the perfect storm to create volatility which creates an opportunity to make money.
It's now about risk mitigation. Keep enough $ &amp; BTC in your account to make short trades, that you can shrug off if you lose, and remove the rest.

Current simulation results are at 5%.
The GA constantly runs and readjusts to new price data. I just flipped the switch today and went live. I am now actively trading with it to see how she runs in the real world.
[EDIT] I should be really clear about this, had I started trading from the beginning the results would not be 5%. What this percentage would be I can't answer as I'm still tweaking the fitness function. Anyway, the point of this system is to make it adaptive to new conditions. For this reason more recent simulated trades should be weighted more heavily than simulated 10 day old trades. See my root comment regarding the difficulty in finalizing the fitness function.
[EDIT2]: Sorry no, I'm not looking for investors. I worry enough about my own.

I came here to post the same thing. This is the best way to utilize the computers to generate bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-06-11 19:44:35
It's still under heavy development and there is no user interface yet.
I added some simple reporting here (dynamically updated):  
It's very dependent on the scoring formula which is really just writing your strategy in code. If you just focus on total profit the GA will just curve fit to the historic data..which isn't useful at all. I'm trying to set it up to focus on the intraday noise floor so it can reliably turn a profit in both positive and negative price cycles.
I won't have a problem eventually sharing this. There is no magic strategy to be found so it's use would be different for everyone.

I had a professor back in college tell a story about some students programming a  robot with GA. The goal was to have the robot pick up a ball and drop it in a bucket. What ended up happening was that the robot  learned to pick up the ball and bounce it off the wall into the bucket. I guess you would call that a 'local optimum'.
Anyway, the point was that while a solution was found it obviously wasn't the intention of the programmers. They failed to account for the surrounding environment in their fitness function.
In my case, I spent a good week watching it settle on surprising results while trying different fitness functions and waiting for enough historic data to cover all market conditions (rising,falling &amp; flat).
The very first time I went live with the tool was 10min before the MtGox crash. I went to the bathroom, thinking it would be at least a few minutes before an order would get triggered. When I came back my bot spent all my money buying into the crash. I freaked out for a minute until I realized what was going on.  Unfortunately my $3 BTC orders got rolled back :( 
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:11:17
I didn't misunderstand, you just don't get it.
Mt Gox had nothing to do with setting the price. You could have one market or a billion markets. The price will always be set by the buyers and sellers of BTC. People looked to MtGox solely because it was an active exchange with significant trade volume.
Fracturing the market will result in two things. Exchange competition and arbitrage traders.

Just because some people don't know how to use a tool doesn't mean the tool is worthless.
Technical analysis isn't sold as some formula for the purpose of guaranteeing a profit. Your summary would be quite correct if you only consider the individuals who treat it as such.
Technical analysis is a way to transform time series data into alternate 'indicator' views. The purpose is to isolate and provide a clear view of individual components of that signal.
A simple example of this would be a volatility index. Its purpose is to indicate trends of increased price volatility. Doesn't sound like bullshit to me, it's simple math.
Another example would be EMA (exponential moving averages). Its purpose is to show a weighted average over time. Doesn't sound like bullshit to me, it's simple math.
MACD (Moving average convergence divergence). Its purpose is to show the difference between two moving averages. Doesn't sound like bullshit to me, it's simple math.
There is NO technical analysis that magically tells you to buy or sell. They are just alternate views of data used as clarifying indicators for your consideration. 
There is a simple reason this is so: The market is not rational. If you treat it as such, you will lose your ass. The market is very heavily driven by emotion. 
Want proof? Visit any trading forum and see what the ratio is between rational and emotional discussion.  
The secret to success is to constantly research your potential/active investments. Read any news, blogs, forums and keep an eye on google trends to understand the emotional trends.
In the case of bitcoin, I would keep an eye open for market access to use bitcoins (viability), government clamp down (regulation), mainstream acceptance (don't waste your time reading the libertarian circle jerk news&amp; blogs.. look for mentions in news &amp; blogs where you least expect it).

I opened up a text editor and just started typing. The code is all 100% python and my own....except for:
The Mt. Gox Python API v0.01 by Jonas Rudloff
I'm sure it's been updated by now, but the version I have was problematic so I hacked and slashed it into something I could use. I'm using a wrapper around it now. If it bothers me enough I could just write a drop in replacement. 
There's nothing too wrong besides the lack of exception handling (and no retry strategy) in the API code. Normally this isn't an issue. However, the way the order id's are retrieved after a buy call can (and has) caused problems. The issue is really with the reliability of MTGox but the API could stand to be more robust.
Oh yeah, and I'm using jquery and flot for the html pages.

I verified three ways...didn't send the letter though. No response to date.
At this point I think Mt.Gox has lost all credibility. The fact that the fellow running the joint seems OK communicating status information through IRC is enough to make me run for the hills.

Good point. It doesn't make sense that they wanted to activate everyones account 1 hr before opening the market.
I assumed the 24hr notice for the market opening would happen AFTER the approval emails went out. This would give people the chance to come collect their belongings or prime the market with buy/sell orders.

Except no one is making $10M trades for BTC. The reality is that alot of the trades are for a single BTC.
Who is going to pay $7 (using the Scott Trade commission as an example) to buy 1BTC worth $16?
I'll gladly pay 0.65% over 44%
Regardless, the real problem is lack of competition to drive commissions down.
With tradehill you have to spam people to get a better rate.

They system acts wonky occasionally.
Wrap every call to mt.gox in a while 1: clause with exception handling (try/except) inside. Put a sleep state within the exception and a break statement after the mtgox call in the try clause.

You're allowing your passion for the project cloud your judgement.
She provided excelent and valuable feedback that was summarily dismissed. This exposed the idea guy as overly protective of the projects direction and incapable of setting his pride aside to objectively consider feedback from others. This is a hallmark description of poor leadership, which has made Scott Adams very rich with his depiction of the PHB.

Once it got going and the right people were on the phone it got much better. They had an issue with their chat client only supporting 250 connections, which worked out in my favor because they asked about a half dozen of my questions :)
@_date: 2011-06-26 15:45:50
It's a streaming data feed. The idea is that you keep the connection open and they push the data to you. You don't make any queries, just maintain an open connection and the data will come.
My script accumulates the data feed on 1 min intervals. It then calculates a volume weighted average price for each exchange if there was any data.

The population is constantly retested to the latest market data and just like an EMA weighs recent prices more heavily, the GA fitness function can score trades the same way.

Is it an intentional ddos, or maybe because they offer a json api they've grown to a point where they can't handle the load from the trading bots?
I would like to hear from Mt.Gox what the acceptable rate of json calls per client would be, or is it throttled? It would be nice to know that my bot is playing nice.

"It seems to me that the hard limit on Bitcoins is problematic ... Is there anything in the design of Bitcoins to mitigate or counteract these pressures"
Yes, it's called a decimal point.

I'll try to answer the best I can. I honestly just learned GA on my own. And by that I mean the only knowledge I started with was define what the gene is, seed a population, score them and mate/mutate the winners.
Through the process of writing this I did a lot of things, all by intuition, that I am just now learning have actual comp-sci names ;)
On to your answers:
The problem space is continuous (so no termination)
The genes are aligned
multi objective
Non-interactive (worth investigating though)
no inversion (I don't get this one,why?)
yes variable mutation
yes two parent offspring with random self replication/mutation
yes multiple parent offspring (will add) **done.**
yes colonization-extinction (currently disabled)
yes multiple independent populations
yes dynamically adjusted population sizes (maintain 1min full population test interval)
yes elitist selection
yes niche penalty (awesome idea..I will be using this one) **done**
yes randomly generated individuals / random immigrants  (immaculate conception.. Jesus genes. Yup got those: )
no comma strategy (worth trying)
no grey encoding (I don't get why this would help - mutations are random so shifting bits around should have no effect. Am I missing 
yes adaptive parameters (yes, so I guess I should call this an AGA system?)
no hill climbing (sounds like a PITA, I'll think about this one)
no memetic algorithms (isn't this a fancy way of saying GA + hill climbing ?)
no gene pool recombination (downloaded the paper will investigate later)
no NSGA-2 (downloaded the paper will investigate later...looks computationally expensive but if it can locate the global optimum it may be worth it) 
**[EDIT]NSGA-2 seems like a good idea for single process GAs to maintain sub-populations within different local optima in an effort to find the global optima. I kind of already have that by having 5 separate processes with independent populations. I'm going to try something different. I am going to add a monitor to the simulator code to flag when a local optima has been reached (no further increases in max_score after n cycles) the winner will be added to a special BOB (best of the best population) maintained by the gene server. The simulator will then trigger a colonization-extinction event to locate the next local optima. I'll dedicate one GA simulator to periodically pull the BOB population from the server for additional testing. I have to do it this way because the server is round-robin; I'll lose the BOBs otherwise -- plus I need to constantly update the scores.**
I explained the gene structure elsewhere in this thread.

This is very relevant. 
Bitcoin has been steadily falling for a week now. If you've been watching closely there have been many periods where there has been a sharp decline followed by the dead cat bounce. It usually lands just below the middle of the drop off afterwhich the slow decline continues.
This has happened multiple times in the last week. If you catch the drop you can make a quick buck or two on the bounce. But whatever you do don't hold after the dip because within twelve hours you'll be upside down on the position.

It's not nefarious. It's called profit taking.
After the massive share dump the people who bought in will be taking their profits too.
Anyway, it should be interesting to watch the volatility generated from the impulse response of the market.

It's not my bot doing this, I swear :)
The bot has been off line the last couple of days for upgrades and debugging. I've already made the trade system more robust and will be adding some market detection code today so the system can automatically switch between radically different GA strategies on the fly. 
That being said, it has already completed about 600 trades and is profitable ;)

The genetic code is all custom.
I wanted the genes to be as compact as possible with the ability to naturally constrain the range of each number. The result is that I don't have normal data types such as int and float. 
I define the numbers as 2^n (arbitrary bit length). For example, I can have three bit numbers (range 0-4). 
Floats are specified by 10^n . Which basically just shifts the decimal point around. For example a three bit number with a float spec of 10^1 would give me a range of 0.0 to 0.4 in 0,1 increments.
The code for the three bit float described would look like this:
g.add_numvar("some variable name",3,1)
It takes some playing around with a calculator to set up my data types with the desired range and resolution. The benefit is that I am reducing my search space which makes the system more efficient.

"MtGox controlled the price" - This is simply an incorrect statement. 
If you want to argue that they had too large a share of the exchange market then I'm inclined to agree.
Also, Bitcoin is to each person whatever they see it as being. Some want a currency revolution while others want to make a quick buck.

lol amateurs ;)
Also written in python... I have:
1) Data collection from Mt. Gox
2) Trading system (MACD + some other custom indicators)
and my favorite part
3) Genetics
Basically the way it works is that:
1) One program downloads the data at a set interval. 
2) The trading system is just a class that has configurable inputs (long moving window, short moving window, stop loss, MACD trip point, target mark ups, buy delays, etc..). It takes streaming data from step one as the input and spits out a "score".
3) Custom genetics class to feed the configuration of the trading system which loops forever (with the data set constantly updated from step 1)
The result is a constantly updated automated trade system. 
The part that takes the most thought is the scoring formula -- it's not just total profit. Right now I think I have about 7-8 variables used to calculate the score.
The rest: placing and canceling orders, is the easy stuff.

My only involvement in bitcoins so far is on the speculation side.
I'm currently sitting on a 20% return after my first week out. And if dwolla wasn't so ass slow in completing bank deposits I would have bought more on this dip.
The moral of this story is that just because you suck at managing your investments doesn't mean it's not possible to make money.
HINT: It's exactly this type of price volatility which creates an opportunity for massive profits.

Regarding TraderTimm's comment about the reported 'net worth': 
The periods in time where it appears that the reported net worth is tracking the price of BTC simply means that the bot is holding inventory, waiting for the target price to be reached. Net worth isn't used anywhere in the GA algo, it's only reported as a visual sanity check. And as i mentioned in the original thread, as the GA constantly updates to adapt to new data, the reported 'net worth' will constantly change. The system is internally weighted (within the fitness function) to favor more recent trades. Therfore, the reported net worth should not be taken as an indicator of performance of the system over time. It's was simply a snapshot in time. Also, at no time was the complete account balance in play which further diminishes it value in calculating ROI.
Regarding HideousBeastManGuy comment: 
"You cannot run HFTs unless you have Fill-Or-Kill (FOK) orders."
I do have that functionality! While not officially supported in the MtGox API, it took almost no effort to implement in software. I have automatic order cancellation (buy wait), stop loss, stop age, commit to sell target and sell target prices built into my trade platform.
I am limited in two ways to meet the true definition of HFT - Latency in the MtGox API &amp; volume/volatility. Notice that neither one of them have anything to do with my system. While it can be argued that I am not currently meeting the true definition of HFT, my system IS HFT ready. Once user keys are re enabled through the websocket, that only leaves volume/volatility as the limiting factor.
That being said, the bot currently averages 100 trades a day in a throttled state (used for debugging) with about 600 total trades.
 
He also said: "Also, I'm not sure I subscribe to the whole genetic algorithm being something that can be applied to markets, as it seems to me you'd have a massive hurdle in that the algorithm would want to choose the best winners on a curve-fitting basis.  Perhaps he's taken measures to avoid this"
 
Simpleton fitness functions will always curve fit. It's funny how computers do exactly what you tell them. This is why, in my original post, I talked about the difficulty in coming up with a suitable fitness function. 
This is probably why 90% of people who will / or ever have tried to tackle GAs for market trading have or will give up. If you ever hear of anyone trash GAs as being limited or worthless, I'd bet money it's because they couldn't develop a suitable fitness function.
At this point I could probably write a book called 'Fitness Functions: I bet your doing it wrong' with everything I've learned. 
Anyway, yeah I have taken multiple measures to avoid curve fitting. I have a power function for non linear age weighting, an exponential function for non linear trade period weighting and the latest hack is market variance detection (True Range) run through a histogram to split the GA system into variance quartiles. Simulated buy orders are now gated to the quartile linked gene being tested. Now I can optimize for multiple market conditions in parallel and switch active strategies on the fly dependent on current market conditions. There are a couple of other key optimizations I made to avoid curve fitting, but this post is getting too long.  
I do however agree with this:
"Writing a long-run winning bot (that is 1000+ trades at a minimum) is nearly impossible with no prior knowledge of trading, with only a few exceptions."
I'm not the exception, I did have 'prior knowledge'.

Here is an example gene:
It's a binary representation of the inputs to my bicoin trade strategy simulator. It contains such things as EMA window long, EMA window short, MACD trigger, stop loss %, mark up%...etc.
The data is decoded and used to configure the simulator for testing. The simulator generates a score to determine the 'fitness' of a given gene.
The gene is returned to the population (a list of genes) and once all the genes have been tested I play god and kill off the weak and breed the strong. 
Over many generations you will converge on a 'local optimum' but you wont necessarily find the 'global optimum'. This is why I run multiple independent populations; I'm trying to find the global optimum.

Please re-read my comment... I said to put a sleep state in the exception. To be more clear, what this means is to wait a period of time  before retrying. In my code I wait 1min before retrying on failure.
You do make a good point though. I put in a support request a few days ago into mt.gox asking about the acceptable rate of submitting queries. I am still waiting for a response, but in the mean time I'm throttling my connections to what I would consider reasonable.

I was lucky though as I was sitting at the computer working on the code when the crash happened. I shut down the bot, and manually entered my orders when I saw the bottom coming.
@_date: 2011-07-08 04:24:01
I understand what you mean. I don't have the whole thing wrapped up in an easy to digest user interface.
What your looking at is 5 genetic algo trade simulators running in parallel to find the best trade strategy which is then picked up by the automated trading bot used for live trading. The chart you see shows the simulation results for the currently winning trade strategy.
What I am not showing are the real results from live trading using these tools. A book is kept but I haven't prettied up the html yet.
