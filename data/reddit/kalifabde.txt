Then think harder and more rationally. There is not really a difference between pure altruism and pure egoism and you could explain anything in both ways.
Both ways will make you come to the same conclusion:
You are happy with yourself if you own your selfisher urges (like e.g. greed, hypocricy, hate, fear...) and that you increasingly dislike yourself if you give in to them. Working on disliking youself out of egoism is just stupid.
On the other hand what others (like development countries) need are self-sufficient, independent, healthy and proud people to be entrepreneurs, scientists, politicians or educators. If you don't take care of yourself, treat yourself and work on your own needs, you can't be any of that and you can't make anyone be like that. You'll always be in need AND make others dependent of you which is not really helping them. Working on others becoming/staying dependent of you out of altruism is just stupid. Making yourself dependent out of altruism, too.
So in the end you need to act rationally and reflect your feelings and decisions. Be kind to yourself and work on your own development and progression. Be critical of others and yourself, don't let yourself lie to you and don't let others exploit you. (Exploiting you wouldn't be any good to them as exploiting others wouldn't be any good to you. Every cognitive dissonance is a crossroad with one way leading to personal development and the other to self-deception and advancing misery.)
What's best for you and what's best for society is the same. Similarly on the long term what's best for society is the same as what's best for humanity and the global environment.
I can't see any benefit for individuals or collectives by egoism or altruism, if they're not thought to the end.
No need for religion if you're rational enough.
