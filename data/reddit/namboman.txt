Oh if you thinks it's low just read their comments in the replies. Lol

Is this pedantry or are you unaware of what an AdC is? They’re little more than servants. Assuming this was Haig’s commentary, leaked intentionally by the AdC, is more than a reasonable assumption to make.
At any rate, either he’s espousing Haig’s true opinion when it would have been uncouth for him to do so, or he’s a personal servant criticizing a technological innovation from a position of ignorance. 
my point that using this quote as an analogy for Bitcoin because it appeals to authority, where there is none, is unchanged based on which scenario is true anyways

Being a con artist apologist is a bad look

The analogy is dumb because it insinuates Haig was an expert who was wrong, but that’s so blatantly incorrect that its probably intentionally dishonest. the reality is that Haig was one of worst military leaders of the last 200 years. You would struggle to find a single example of mediocre military thinking in his resume, much less expertise. he was a dunce that leadership above him abjectly failed to restrict the impacts of his stupidity. 
It would be like making an analogy with Kim Jong’s political thinking as expertise simply because he’s a political leader.

The OP shows just as much ignorance as crypto doubters by using this quote and this man as some incorrect “expert” opinion on tanks.
This dude was one of the worst commanders in British history, and earned a nickname for how callously he sent his men to the slaughterhouse with nothing to gain from it

That doesn't fit with his persecution complex now does it?

Why go after charges you have to 'try' to prove when he can do life for lay-up drug charges?
Not everything needs to be a conspiracy.

So is it quite a few, or just two?
