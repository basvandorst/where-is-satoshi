I put more effort into that than they did into their shutdown notice.  I care.

That's a nice comparison.  The upcoming opportunity to buy BTC for cents on the dollar....

I'm simply talking about aggregating multiple feeds into a single consolidated location online, showing an average live price and the ability to check certain source or ignore them on purpose, or if they are lagging to take them out of the aggregate entirely.  I think panic would reduce by distributing the market data so that when Mt. Gox inevitably chokes, others are maintaining what looks like stability so Gox doesn't barf all over the market just because of weak software.

this is a fairly accurate expectation.  My 6970x2 setup with standard clocks/voltages but fans at 70-80% do ~150w according to my UPS wattage monitor. Each does 300-320mh

Well said. Fees must be imposed to create a healthy ecosystem here.  If there is no monetary barrier to entry from market floods, then it costs nothing but time and electricity to wreak havoc on the system. If they were to say each trade costs a fee so we can provide you the absolute best and most stable trading platform, people would happily pay for it. I think OP just needs more time in business to learn these things, TBH.

FWIW, As a tech guy, I'd suggest that if you haven't already, please look into a VoltDB-backed system for the next iteration.  It may apply to your needs (not knowing specifically what those are, but assuming you have a high transactions-per-second rate) - Not only will you save money on hardware, you will see some staggering improvements in the amount of transactions your system can handle per second.  I can point to you this recent [report] ( that demonstrates for example, Node.js achieving 695,000 ACID transactions per second on an EC2 instance running VoltDB.

If you're not in ThereBucks, you're not truly diversified.

I bet so too, because BFL seems to be bridge financing their work with preorder money and not getting the results they expected.

There are some in-memory database solutions that would all but negate this issue and not limit the way people are using Mt. Gox - for example -  Node.js achieving 695,000 ACID transactions per second on an EC2 instance running VoltDB.  The system can be scaled up easily so that that sort of issue would be handled much more effectively.

No fault, we do what we have to, but if you're like me, you have a belief that money becomes a by-product of doing something you love, therefore working for money is the wrong goal entirely.   You could follow other interests and easily become very successful in those areas while also enjoying your work more, and be more fulfilled.  That's what I'm working towards.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:31:57
That made my day, I hope Mt. Gox can laugh at that too

It seems to me that HFT is good, it seems like it provides a backbone to the trading activity that actually helps mitigate the market impact of large trades, and because BTC is volatile as you said, money can be made daily on relatively small moves in price, right? Please correct me or expand on this thought, I'm just a student of all of this :)

I think you've got the right scope of responsibility, but I would definitely agree with others that until you can handle microtransactions, don't allow them for the good of the land. Coding with altruistic goals in mind is great, but a more pragmatic approach is required to make your minimum viable product stable, with or without limitations.  For example,  Instead of people coming here and grilling you guys over the recent downtime, perhaps you would have had more fun in explaining to people that the reason you decided to impose transaction per second throttling or minimum transaction amounts &gt; 0.01 is to protect the market from panic crashes.  I think people would view that as stewardship, instead of viewing Mt. Gox as merely trying to keep up and failing.

With that said, why not an index of major exchanges, and when one goes down, we still have others in a single place, with an averaged index?  Seems like that would minimize the problem when Mt. Gox or whoever lags out...
