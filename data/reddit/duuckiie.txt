They use the interbank rate, currently £1=€1.1350
Check out r/bitcoinuk

Not sure why I’m being downvoted, this is a popular solution in the U.K. and would have saved you those £60 in fees.

Use revolut, there are no fees.

Like I said, the price of bitcoin is different on coinbase and gdax. It’s shows a lower amount because if you sold on coinbase you’d get less money than on gdax. 
Move your bitcoin back to gdax and you’ll see you’ve not lost anything.

Transfer in money with revolut, it should verify no problem.

Use revolut, you can hold accounts in EUR and GBP. This is how I do it.
1. Bank transfer/Apple Pay GBP to revolut
2. Convert GBP to EUR (they have a very good exchange rate with no fees)
3. Send to Coinbase/gdax via SEPA (SEPA transfers are free)
It’s just the other way round to withdraw.

There are no fees. Did you sell your bitcoin again before moving it to Coinbase? If so you might have sold it at a loss. 
Otherwise if you transferred your bitcoin to Coinbase, it will indicate a lower value because the bitcoin price on Coinbase is different than on GDAX. If you move it back to GDAX you should see you still have at least €100 assuming the price hasn’t gone down.
