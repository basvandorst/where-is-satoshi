Huh? The entire world invested in cash. It is now the world reserve currency. The difference? They could print more cash, but there is a finite number of Bitcoins. As more and more Countries begin to buy and sell oil with other currencies the demand for the dollar will decrease. It's simple supply and demand. For your own sake you should keep studying and not just play devil's advocate without educating yourself.  Makes you look foolish.

Just being realistic. I hope there are enough whales on both sides of the trade to counteract, but Bitcoin is unregulated so until that changes whales will continue to get away with price manipulation.

They are right actually. When whales make bets on future price movements in an unregulated market they manipulate said market with massive volume trading. Coinbase? Think for yourself. If you were a whale why wouldn't you manipulate the price with volume to win your bet.

Whales can and do hodl too.

Taxes bro. Taxes. By law, you have to keep records and pay short term capital gains taxes every time you sell. My guess is you don't do this. Eventually the tax man will come knocking. Good luck with that.

I think it's easy to get overwhelmed in a situation like this because there is so much misinformation you want to correct, but you can't do it without jumping all over the place. I have found that explaining what "sound money" is and then explaining how Bitcoin checks all the boxes is a great start. If you are having trouble with questions like "how are they created?" it might mean you need to learn some more about mining. There's no shame in that. A great list of learning resources is here:  To all the people saying they lie and don't explain it to their families I don't agree with this strategy. If you care about them you would want them to have "Wealth Insurance" too.

Yup. Always looking for attention when I'm trading then complains later that we don't have more. So annoying.

You just described cash over the last 50 years.

Well, I'm not sure since it's unregulated as of yet it could be a gray area. If anyone did do that it is obviously shady and (at least imo) highly unethical.

I see no reason either. It would be a genius (albeit immoral, shady, questionably legal) plan if made from the get go. BCH has gone up like 25% in the last few hours. I bought some a little while ago at .101 BTC, because I think there could be some major money creeping in. Software upgrade is in a few days too, which you know Ver will be promoting. I know this might be frowned upon in this forum, but if I can make more bitcoin by hopping on this BCH run I will. Do what you will with the info I'm just riding a hunch. There are a lot of powerful people that would like to see BCH hop into that  market cap spot.

It's not mandatory. You don't have to use BitPay.
