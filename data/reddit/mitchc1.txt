Eh, if you’re keen you can also join a mining pool, just make sure you don’t pick a scammy one. Though I do get half the fun is mining it yourself. I joined a pool with the money I would have used to setup miners just to avoid the hassle of setting up and maintaining them. Also didn’t really have the space at my place..

Good video.

For your health!

I was actually just trusting you with that math, haha. But yes, you're right now. 
Though those numbers don't take into account compound growth which I think would be the largest contributing factor to a faster rise in market cap.
Compound growth at 2% could still be worked out, though in my phone right now and too lazy. It should be considerably less than 290 years. 
That being said, I think we may need more than an average growth of 2% without massive game-changing spikes to see $1mBTC in our lifetimes.

The current BTC market cap is $16,450,082,691. A rise in %1 increases the market value by $164.5m. In the past 24 hours the rise was 2.4%. 
Yes, you'll have to wait 60 years if there is an average rise of $1m per day, but what about if it's $200m per day?
Tell me I'm doing the math wrong?

Haha, oh no!

Is that possible, though?
If it's possible to re-mine coins stored in private wallets to be allocated elsewhere after 20 years, why can't that be done now? I thought coins in private wallets were supposed to be untouchable without the keys.

Don’t mind me, just a simpleton passing through.

Wouldn’t more people buying increase the price of BCC?

Not sure if you're joking. I love Bitcoin, but that is terrible advice. OP, only invest what you can afford to lose.

So you're saying one online casino had more dollars worth of crypto than the entire dollar value of BTC? You mean $150 million?

You can also get the same ones for about $1 each [here]( :) 
I just bought a gold and a silver one a few days ago for some texas hold 'em card protectors!

Great, thanks! I am setting up an account there now, is it easy to move the BTC to your own wallet?

I would like to know this too. I have my bitcoins stored in a wallet on my computer, about $200 worth (may be buying more in the future). Just don't know if it's worth moving them to an offline wallet, also not really sure how and if I need specific hardware, because I've seen a few things advertised for $100-$200 marketed as offline wallets.
