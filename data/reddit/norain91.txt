Wait until next week when they say they can solve the energy crisis by moving all the blockchain owned bitcoin computers to an arctic research station.

I get that there are guys that do this, and they are sexist, condescending assholes. However, there was one time I was out with a group of friends, and one of the girls in our group didn't understand a topic and when I tried to explain it, she accused me of "mansplaining". I didn't feel that I had a condescending tone or anything, I just had experience and knowledge of the topic, and was sharing that. I didn't realize we were at a point in our society where if a man wants to explain his knowledge of a topic to a woman, it is met with hostility and anger.

That was the part that blew my mind. Did he literally think they were talking about gifting people $15k???

Well considering the guys on Mad Money were wondering if you could split a bitcoin last week, I think it's fair to be cautious announcing your involvement. When I talk to anyone, even close friends about bitcoin, they assume I am loaded and I have to clarify I am just a mild hodler.

STILL WAITING TO GO TO THE MOON

That is how I feel about most alt coins to be honest.

Black market of Bill's Hat incoming.

Currently sitting on a treasure trove of TF2 hats. I had better declare those assets.

But if one of the benefits to Bitcoin is the fact that it is cheaper and easier to pay why is it so expensive. There should be an incentive to pay in Bitcoin, not a downside to it.

Assuming no maintenance or anything. In the states if you make more power than you use, you sell the excess back to the grid and can actually make some money.

Well for 6 lbs of food that isn't bad. I was thinking it was just the sandwich and stuff.

The only thing that came out of it for me is a few hundred bucks for free...
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:55:54
Exactly. Not saying I am above that, I definitely side on the side of wanting to keep my money.

Congratulations, you just discovered the motivations and reasons why a good number of millionaires and billionaires don't pay their fair share of taxes.

Well, I mean, you could say the same thing about every new crypto that hits the market. Bitcoin included. It is all money coming out of thin air. But there is a reason for it though. We are still so early in the life of Bitcoin and we need to find new ways to make it more usable and accessible for the average person to use. While that happens, I am alright with a hard fork here or there until it all gets sorted out.

Instead politicians are realizing the American public is growing tired of blowing money in the middle east with no way of ever leaving, so instead of leaving, we are just going to start a new war in a fresh new country.

This is what I have to tell people when they tell me "BITCOIN IS CRASHING". I don't think it will ever crash to zero. A different fork might become mainstream, or an altcoin in the long run, but I have a very very hard time trying to imagine a scenario where cryptocurrency is not the future.

Buy high and sell low! It's the best investment strategy.
