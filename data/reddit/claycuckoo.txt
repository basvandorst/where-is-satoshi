Sent 0.01 now, know it's not much but if everybody gives a little we can make a difference.

This is so true. If this is a fatal flaw in bitcoin then we need to know now.

At least it will some day be recognised that awarding social scientists with Nobel prize is detrimental. Not only is it hard to prove anything in economy; also the winners of the prize will become full of themselves and assured of their own infallibility as is the case with Krugman.

Agree. And human settlement of space is achievable but more a cost issue so I'd say he was right. 
About the IBM quote it's certainly funny but taken out of context. He was talking about the current world market, not making predictions about the future. Krugman on the other hand is very specific about the Internet being a fad, showing extraordinary lack of vision and insight.

True dat.  Maybe we should use him as a compass when trying to find what is just WRONG. I especially cringe when reading this part: "most people have nothing to say to each other". Translation: the unwashed masses are too stupid have anything to say.

This man is a fake. Constantly name dropping and referring to obscure theories and thought experiments but actually having no true understanding.

Does anybody know of any similar shop within the EU? I would love to use Bitcoinstore  but the added customs fee when ordering from US makes it too expensive I'm afraid.

Great article! THANKS.

The Nobel prize is a disgrace and Alfred must be turning in his grave. Actually the economics prize was instituted by the Swedish central bank long after Nobel's death which is indeed very telling. And then we have the Peace prize which has become an even bigger  joke...

The old saying "There's no fool like an educated fool" fits perfectly with Krugman.
