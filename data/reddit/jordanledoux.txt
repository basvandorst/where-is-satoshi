My first 50 BTC were before there was a "price". People would offer, sometimes, to paypal you a dollar for a few hundred.
The hard drive that contained the wallet keys for that pile of BTC was lost long ago.
I am one of the very, very first and also one of the very, very last people to adopt bitcoin. :/

It makes other investors more risk-averse. Whether or not that's more efficient depends on what you think the purpose of the market is.

I'd just like to point out that ANY computation performed in constant time, no matter what the constant is, is O(1).
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:08:54
If bitcoin is about that belief it will fall.
It has to be a fundamentally better solution to exchanging value between parties to succeed. No one gives a fuck about peer to peer ideologies in currency unless that ideology is actually a fact about fundamental efficiency.
But at that point it isn't something anyone cares about, it's just a fact.

Yeah, can't use one way encryption on the key itself.

He's talking about the absolute basics of how programming and tech businesses work.

When did bitcoin become this ballpit of fucking children pissing on each other?
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:06:04
Forgive me, but how is that not the way it was supposed to work? A new client with a new feature was released in the open, it wasn't adopted enough, so neither was the feature. I don't see where the social engineering took place. 
If people in the decentralization camp think that any forked client is offensive... well bitcoin the software is probably not for them since it's open source.
The blockchain will vote, the process will by design always be democratic. And both the ledger and software can be forked completely if somehow the network becomes compromised. 
This honestly sounds like a computer science discussion that a bunch of political science majors stumbled into. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:00:00
So then there is literally nothing that you will accept as proof. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:03:06
Forgive me for being blunt but... so?
It's a fucking mathematical algorithm, and the source is open. If you have an opinion on things, change the code to reflect that opinion. It'll either be adopted by a majority or it won't.
Everything else is bullshit. The bluster from people flaming and the people who have "non-conformist" views are both utterly without purpose. Bitcoin has a function, it is not a cause.
Someone can believe it is a cause, but it is a just a tool. They are factually incorrect.
If you don't like the tool, change the tool. Why in the world are people getting riled up arguing about how *other* people should change the tool?

Perhaps I was unclear, but my comment was in reference to the fact that this is a strictly technical issue that will be solved in some way at some time within the constraints of reality and little else. I was pointing out that to me, having sort of missed this, it seems like a whole bunch of people discussing the politics of the color of the sky or something.

Policing behavior is moderation. Policing ideas is censorship. Do not attempt to say they are the same thing, they aren't.

How exactly could such a situation create an unfixable problem in the blockchain? It could create a temporary problem in the blockchain, or coins that got spent twice, but those are both issues that have technical solutions.
Unless the 'problem' is 100% availability and reliability of the network for everyone always. In which case... you're in the wrong technology. Bitcoin is not designed in a way to guarantee that because you can't control the counter-party. That's in fact it's largest strength.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:38:28
Why exactly would that be something people care enough about to get this... erm, human about it? That's a technical problem that will be solved one way or the other, and everyone's opinions about it are fairly irrelevant. The realities of the math and technologies involved will drive the solution, whatever it is.
It's something where there are objective realities involved, how can it be a contentious debate? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:46:31
Well you clearly care. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:54:39
Thanks, this is what I was asking about.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:55:07
Interesting. So it's impossible using bitcoinqt to take *some* money from a wallet?
@_date: 2013-10-02 14:46:54
Everyone's computers are compromised. Over 70% of all internet connected PCs have some form of Trojan, keylogger, worm or virus on them at this very moment, probably including yours.
The reason your wallet hasn't been stolen yet is more due to the fact that you are more valuable for other purposes to the person that owns the vector. 
If you really want to ensure you computer is clean, wipe the hard drive (DoD 7-write delete), format it, reinstall a configurable and difficult to penetrate OS (BSD, SUSE, Ubuntu), and install windows into a VM.
Load up the VM fresh for every internet session, anything you "catch" will be wiped when the VM shuts down.

Oh really?

bitaddress.com is a non-existent site, first off... second, *how* does an address that I generate belong to *me*?

I had 5 BTC waaaaaaay back when it was a brand new thing. Like before anyone but us programmers really knew about it.
I eventually, subconsciously, decided that it was one of those programmer fads. Things that would be really cool if normal people picked it up, but only programmers would care, and then I forgot about it.
Fastforward and the wallet they were in is gone. I have no clue where it is, how I encrypted it, or anything like that.
And it's really hard for me to get into building a new wallet when I look at the price and realize how much that forever lost wallet is worth.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:46:07
I wish it crashed to $2. :/ I'd be able to pick up a ton of BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:15:51
The reason to avoid the word fiat is not because it casts you in any particular light, but because it has no relevance to the information being presented, and fundamentally Wikipedia is about presenting information.
It likely violates the Neutral Point of View policy, and it is not actually what the sentence is even intended to mean (which is that all currency is used for unauthorized activity, fiat or not).
Money laundering a criminal activity occurred in USD before it was taken off the gold standard. The word fiat conveys no useful information of any kind, and that is why it should not be present.

That would put the ceiling on BTC right now, if the entire economy ran through it, at around $406,000 = 1 BTC.
Notice I said:
- That's the current *ceiling*. 
- That assumes that our entire economy operates in BTC.
On that note, I'm rather sad that I don't have any cash to purchase BTC, and only have... what... 0.0024 BTC to my name right now. :/ Oh well, I grew out of being poor once, I suppose I can do it again.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:14:15
How about this one:
Encrypted wallets that the encryption key is lost for result in all the BTC in that wallet being erased from existence.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:50:01
Yeah, I of course went through all the options and buttons I saw before posting here. Maybe I just missed it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:13:00
It's not silly, it's the function of the service, because it's what helps prevent things like this and address it when it is spotted.
Wikipedia is not a place to advocate, it is a place for simple information. The fact that USD is used for money laundering or criminal activity is not relevant to the USD article because:
- All currency is used this way some of the time.
- The quantity of transactions that are legitimate versus illegitimate is very low.
- The reason criminal transactions are performed in USD has nothing to do with the currency as a feature but as a convenience.
It is relevant to the BTC article at least as a sentence because:
- A non-trivial portion of the early adopters of BTC did so because the anonymity of recipients helped conceal the activities that were occurring.
- The reason criminal activity at all utilizes BTC is specifically tied to a feature of the currency itself.
The current state of the BTC article is fine. There is a section that briefly covers criminal activity and notes that while senders and receivers are anonymized, transactions are not and so some types of activity are not actively supported by the BTC protocol as it was not specifically designed for illegal activities or to launder money.
The notion, however, that someone is playing a game and that you must beat them at it show a misunderstanding of what Wikipedia is and what the actual impact of things like this are and what you should do to help bring clarity to the information presented.
Stop being a fundamentalist. Reality just is.

Wikipedia requires sources, not sources you can link to. Many things on Wikipedia are sourced with publications.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:04:10
Back that thought up with sources and you have yourself something you can put on Wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:36:14
Ah, yes, i didn't connect the points. An address doesn't belong *to* me, it belongs to whoever is using it through the public ledger, meaning that any random address can simply "appear" in the ledger as the recipient of some BTC. And then, yes, the crypto nature of the currency itself and the way the addresses work, makes the address functionally unique.

Making an attack impossible is a losing proposition, but having a false premise at the beginning of your plan is a recipe for disaster.

I didn't click it, because to me "receive coins" is an action. I'm not sure, I guess I thought it was some kind of tied in miner? Or something with the exchanges? Something where I am performing the action of receiving coins.
Once I clicked on it, it was quite clear what it was for and that it was what I was looking for.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:56:26
Yeah, pool mining. It would take me 2-3 months to finish a solo block.
