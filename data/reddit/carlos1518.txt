thank god, everyone is talking about how great she is, but i noticed how she avoided some important questions, there is nothing wrong with that, but a conversation goes both ways, seems like everyone in here was paying attention to Elizabeth instead of the interviewer as well

Please don't get me wrong, there are two sides of having that kind of people...In a regular country if the owner of a store increases the price 100% without reason people will just go to the next store, and if every business decide to increase prices the government will step in, not to enfoce them lower the prices but to actually understand the situation and help as much as possible to fix whatever issue they're having so the economy get back to its route.
Venezuela is a rich country, each person destroyed the country somehow and they're still doing it, what news won't show you is that while there is a long line in a supermarket to buy food, a few blocks from there there is a restaurant full of people having a blast and they are at best "middle class" not rich ones, i sure can't tell them how spend their money (and they are also suffering but they are just trying to relax from the situtation even if it takes all the money they have at the moment), but so far what i have seen from other countries is that when the economy and social situation is bad they tend to show empathy and help as much as possible to fix the situation...this is not the case in Venezuela, everyone will take advantage somehow.
My point is that at the very beginning having someone increasing price for no reason and taking advantage of the needed ones is wrong, but when the economy is completely colapsed the irony comes in and that business rich that sells at 5000% profit is the one that saves the country from starvation because he sells the only food out there, and in doing so he also helps the government to avoid civil war, but at the end there is really no empathy from all participants in the economy to help the situtation they just want to profit somehow, not actually move forward to help the country.
In a regular country if you sell something at a 1000% profit compared to the next store people won't buy from you and you will end up lowering the prices.
I have never lived or traveled to other country where you can get rich as fast as you can in Venezuela, since there is no appretitation for the local currency, most people tend to spend all their income at once in whatever goods they find worth having, meaning that if you own a business you will pretty much sell everything, all you have to worry about is to restock as fast as possible and move your money to a stronger currency. (there are no huge store chains so you don't have to worry about someone taking you out of business)

I'm from Venezuela and even though i don't live in my country anymore i always laugh when i read these articles...because bitcoin is way more underground in Venezuela than it's in other countries...noone uses bitcoins in Venezuela for daily operations, with such an inflation you rather have USD which is easier to trade to local fiat currency (bsf) in case of an emergency to buy food and supplies ..the only people that use bitcoin in Venezuela are the rich ones so they can move their money out of the country, it's far from helping the regular people because it's even more difficult to get your hands on bitcoin than any other country out there...
If someone from Venezuela is buying food with bitcoins i bet you they are rich business people so they can resell everything at a higher price taking advantage of the poor needed people, that's how things are in Venezuela...

It's both actually, even if someone less educated, gets enough knowledge to buy bitcoin, they will need the money to do so, and they don't have extra money to keep safe in other currency...and the few ones motivated enough to buy bitcoins they rather have USD because it is easier to trade when you have an emergency
