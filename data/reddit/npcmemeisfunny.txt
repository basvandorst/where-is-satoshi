You can dabble in altcoin mining that is less competitive so that the hashing power of your laptop gives it a reasonable chance of winning the mathematical lottery of finding the next block.
The current difficulty of Bitcoin is too high for a mere laptop or PC with a single GPU to compete with the world.

Yup. This is a pretty sucking dumb comment.  How is he "government controlled" when he's constantly being harrassed by the authorities and the mainstream media?


Oh, you are one of those "working class people are all stupid racists" types. No wonder all of your statements sound so NPC-like.

The point is that points are mostly pointless.

The developers are the true heroes of this crazy experiment called bitcoin!!

What if it's good at buying fiat? Lightning is already faster than SWIFT or Western Union.

This is simply not true. Tommy was reading verbatim from an article already published on that gang so how can the newspaper be legal to print it but Tommy can't read it aloud?

This was the unboxing.  Next video will be interface.  I too am excited!

That's what they are currently working on.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:00:58
Agreed.  A lot of potential in ease of use with regards to micropayments!

I hope you're right. I need more discount coins!!

What kind of wild swings are you expecting in &gt;10ms settlements?  You can be in and out of crypto in the time it takes to blink an eye.

Where are you getting your info? He was told he was arrested for listing off their crimes, not for filming.
Christ, there were other reporters there filming as well and they didn't get arrested.  Sounds like you're the one struggling there, mate!

Fellow hodler since 2013 as well.  When I imagine Bitcoin's role in the world I often visualize the difference between 1990s internet and 2018 internet.

His cousin was repeatedly raped by an Islamic grooming gang while the authorities stood by and did nothing after hundreds of families reported the same thing happening with their daughters.  Robinson welcomes all races but hates how the government was too politically correct to address the problem.
He was the first to report on the widespread grooming gangs scandals so everyone painted him as a racist from that point forward.

Yes. If wealth is transferred it was of value to at least one party.

Exactly this! Innovation towards segwit was a threat to Bitmain's Antminer backdoor software (Antbleed) that temporarily sabotaged the mining equipment when the hardware phoned home to the company servers to authenticate (yes, you needed to check with Bitmain every 10 minutes or so to get permission to use the hardware you paid for)
The r/bitcoin community was onboard with implementing segwit which would help relieve the congestion in the network that helped miners charge more in terms of fees.  The r/BTC folks thought high mining fees were ok and mysteriously Antbleed was discovered shortly after.
So the people who forked away from the consensus (segwit) named their shitcoin Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash has higher mining fees with the added benefit of never being able to handle a lightning network of their own (because segwit is needed to correct the protocol to allow for layer 2 solutions like lightning)
Edit: now r/bitcoin calls Bitcoin Cash "Bcash" to piss off its main spokesman Roger Ver as he knows he's shilling for a shitcoin that lacks the improved features of the real Bitcoin :)

Bitcoin is already on sale right now...everywhere!

You no longer need a bank for payments at all. If you want to "cash out" to fiat you can send it to anyone willing to give you cash for speedy payment (which could be your bank)

I get paid in dollars so it helps calculate the value to me personally much faster
