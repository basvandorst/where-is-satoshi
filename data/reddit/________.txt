Great friendship and conversation
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:17:38
Colored coins or counterparty probably
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:41:14
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:01:46
Losses should be socialized
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:36:10
Tax dat ass
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:18:03
Never trust ver
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:29:10
Look in the app
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:40:57
Ok thanks but your bosses??
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:30:04
Copay is in the top
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:05:45
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:58:38
I think we'll all agree to something soon
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:11:06
You're a financial liability, it's their money now and you get an iou
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:25:58
Yeah I expect all assets to be liquidated
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:07:11
Yes they are
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:50:35
To tual it
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:39:45
Only private. You may need to switch armory to advanced mode then go to wallet properties
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:32:58
What's that, cso is chief security officer
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:37:45
Circle.com they're on sale today
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:25:16
Eth coward
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:45:32
No we don't need shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:30:24
Oh lol I was scared
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:20:43
That's not true, crimes are prosecuted by the people not victims
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:55:27
Yeah fuck op
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:12:47
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:55:14
Mint condition, bodies removed
@_date: 2016-08-02 09:19:22
Back to increasing 
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:37:18
But why do light wallet users care? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:19:31
Obvious scam
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:34:28
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:34:05
Let's hope
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:06:34
You can't change the fee
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:05:53
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:24:55
But it did happen
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:32:23
I've been scared for nothing
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:08:40
No but we'll skin him
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:11:24
Op also hasn't answered whether he's going to buy etc that he lost to give to their rightful owners. That was the whole point. He says user deposits covered ignoring that on purpose.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:28:26
Idk do you have a backup
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:32:08
It can be a colored coin or counterparty
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:33:10
No you sign up and get an ach number, employer has no clue
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:06:58
They are
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:23:39
That's bullshit, losses needed to be socialized
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:45:22
The first hint is that the coins don't actually exist
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:40:58
Yes restore the seed
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:41:19
Note for others that armory is still amazing and I use it primarily
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:50:21
Apple is definitely doing this on purpose
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:38:05
They're too slow
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:09:48
I think it's $100
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:28:26
Yup dump shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:54:43
It's just a hash
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:14:57
Or steal a further 25%
@_date: 2016-08-02 10:05:31
Bush knows
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:29:20
Viruses can get it but you own the private keys, better than any exchange
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:31:33
Excellent news
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:10:49
Doesn't matter since you shouldn't have coins there anyway
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:19:38
I'm very sure they were phished like idiots "Bitgo account locked! Reply with api key to unlock!"
Post mortem is going to be cringey
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:54:08
In true libertarian fashion we'd have our own trial and hang him so no we don't need govt
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:04:19
Who knows where they really are
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:51:15
Looks down but keys are easily recovered so no worries
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:05:56
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:44:44
Sweep the key into mycelium
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:41:44
We're about to implement the $20 floor! Buy paycoin now! 
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:49:45
My account seems to be grandfathered in some way as it says legacy but that will probably go away. So if you're using a fake name or can't verify get out
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:49:25
Statists need more bullets and guns
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:08:52
Nope it's called deterministic seed
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:06:15
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:59:50
Nothing is yours in a bank
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:16:08
Not really
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:37:20
Hold tight while I enter
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:08:34
A lot of ethtards are crying and would rather see everything vanish in a 6 year bankruptcy
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:11:28
Yes losses should be socialized
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:56:07
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:46:00
Your other coins have the same issue
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:50:15
You didn't switch to the new version? The hd version protects against that now
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:16:10
Last week afaik
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:26:47
Apple is fraud
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:38:44
What about the gold iPhones and private jets??
@_date: 2016-08-02 03:05:21
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:32:12
Pretty much
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:27:13
Coinbase isn't bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:10:49
Yeah the halvening really stopped big shorts
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:15:49
I doubt they had an hsm
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:04:27
Liquidate all assets! 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:43:36
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:15:46
But that's just the tip
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:08:08
@_date: 2016-08-08 02:26:31
The fee can't be changed because it needs to be signed and you don't have the private key. And maybe the warning is right, you could be sending a huge fee losing your money
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:36:51
That's what paper wallets are for
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:18:59
Yes they move bitcoin into the exchange wallet where it's no longer theirs
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:09:30
Instantly unless you don't own the private keys
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:17:24
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:24:57
You haven't lost it all. This isn't a full gox. Just wait a bit, they should give you back 80% hopefully more
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:14:33
Because it's a scam
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:42:39
Because they're all bfx assets
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:18:52
Oh I expect all assets to be liquidated. All executives should have salary suspended indefinitely and all company assets put into the bucket. Including those gold iPhones.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:57:45
Tether seems to work well
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:56:36
It'll tell you the btc needed
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:57:47
They gave you a haircut ��
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:34:13
Win 7, core .12, armory .94.1
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:07:54
Uk isn't that strict right? What will they give him 20 years? Usa would give him life. Extradite his ass for also raping a doge
Oh shit 11 years thats it? Damn
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:54:50
Yup dumping shit eth
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:26:52
Buy the tokens
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:57:40
Eth is a shitcoin and should always be dumped
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:13:01
Inside job
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:53:43
Let him buy yummy fruits! 
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:17:01
No one knows for sure, wait a few hours for China to wake up
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:39:04
So he's done pumping eth? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 05:35:08
Long term
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:38:56
You need the seed that's it
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:21:13
Or he was getting too many alerts and turned everything off
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:03:05
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:31:51
Tip of the iceberg, at the bottom is the reptilian govt
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:33:18
you sign up and get an ach number, employer has no clue
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:28:57
You do
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:15:21
Nope bail in
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:22:39
Ok went fine
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:14:12
Losses should be socialized
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:46:14
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:23:13
Why couldn't bitgo use a brainwallet from bfx password as a fourth key, so offline users can't be affected
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:54:23
You can sell but not buy/trade
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:04:48
Hacker gets hacked, lol
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:10:36
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:23:08
I'm starting to think they do this on purpose especially when it's their multisig
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:27:37
Seaman is a loser
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:56:18
Losses are socialized
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:44:49
No doubt it
@_date: 2016-08-07 09:04:40
get a lawyer and sue apple immediately, also have him reach out to press blaming Apple

@_date: 2016-08-03 12:07:47
He's always been our light
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:48:16
They said they're open to exchanging for stock
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:32:07
Awesome, hopefully less than 20% loss and if they can continue business, pay it back weekly
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:18:12
My armory has never failed
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:05:35
Estimates here 
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:59:13
Why they were complicit in grand theft
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:39:11
Because they aren't yours
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:56:27
Trade bfx
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:02:55
Be careful, it's very old and many new ones are fake viruses
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:03:32
How about you describe yourself!!
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:37:09
Pretty funny, bitfinex will be dumping eth and coinbase had to buy etc
@_date: 2016-04-15 07:55:01

@_date: 2016-08-08 04:40:08

That seed backups everything

Nothing is yours in a bank
@_date: 2016-04-21 12:56:01
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:22:15
I figured still good, they used to block people's own money
@_date: 2016-04-13 09:08:05
@_date: 2016-04-21 14:16:38
Bitcoin was made to avoid banks
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:26:54
That's for plausible deniability
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:07:16
Go blog about it
@_date: 2016-04-19 12:07:38
I believe they can turn mercury into gold using megawatts of power per grain. First year dumps market and pays off reactor. Then they print free gold.

That would be cool, fasttech takes it now though
@_date: 2016-04-14 12:42:19
Even though it was your limit, trying to do under $10k is called structuring

@_date: 2016-04-24 03:11:20
It doesn't seem like you can in the gui. Copay does tho.
How are you seeing the path? 
@_date: 2016-04-27 07:26:04
Milliseconds count
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:40:53
Actually coinbase pays the fee
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:17:08
He's Satoshi so he can reverse transactions and get the private keys! Ecdsa or bullshit! 
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:30:09
Etc is the original chain and still going
@_date: 2016-04-15 04:12:48
Wow looks satisfying

To be clear, trezor is worthless without the paper seed

A broker lost some Bitcoins
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:26:42

Not really. This was no different before. Just before bad guys not only broke the rules, vultr got a chargeback soon after. With bitcoin they at least got their money. 
Secondly, they can simply require an initial $50 bitcoin payment and keep it if the guy spams. They're doing it the stupid way.

Yes Andreas is one
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:19:22
A big struggle with coinbase and exchanges is having small confirmed inputs, they try to keep thousands ready. I'd send .5 at a time but that depends if you want to spend 20 fees. I don't want my addresses sticking out with large balances or when I spend and get change
@_date: 2015-12-27 04:07:06
Sounds fun

I've run one for years and 0 issues
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:14:06
Yes. Say you send .1 now you have to wait for your change of 9.9 to confirm before you have any funds again and the coffee shop can see. Some wallets let you spend unconfirmed funds but some companies may not accept chained transactions until it's confirmed. But you can break it up after you send to trezor. First practice sending small amounts.
Also combining whatever inputs you have on the iPhone could be a privacy risk, but mobile wallets usually don't let you see and send specific inputs, sending smaller transactions can help by doing it blindly
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:52:47

Yes we're lucky 1 click wasn't critical. It might actually be bad for other sites. Bitcoin patents may cover something critical and which company will fight it?

That sucks bro, the fat managers either get jealous of the girls and fire them or make them quit by hitting on them. These chicks wanna meet a rich depositor not a fat banker. I hope some are left when I sell bitcoin to make a large cash deposit then quickly buy back while in bed with her.

Circle but the fees are more than your rewards and rewards don't apply to cash advances

@_date: 2015-12-27 02:09:40

They could be greasy from filthy people of Walmart
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:07:16

Spread your eggs on coinbase, circle and Gemini. Send through at least two intermediate wallets before the final destination. Never admit to anything, you'll get your account closed anyway without admission of guilt to fincen.

@_date: 2015-12-31 10:55:37
This is how they're stealing plus they already stole the Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:33:32
A whole point of bitcoin is being universal. Private chains can't talk to each other and have no point. Imagine if every device had its own internet. 
Aol and compuserve died quickly. Sms succeeded overnight because it was any carrier any country. This is why there's no video calling, everyone is proprietary. Idiot corporations is why we can't have nice things.
@_date: 2015-12-21 18:12:23
Gives me chills just thinking about it tho. How do these sites even make sure those people don't use them the next month? 
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:18:15
I think bitcoin is a security if forex is
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:50:12
You're just seeing different exchange rates
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:42:17
They just paycoined
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:51:00
That's exactly what it is except those guys had to have clean rooms that never saw the source code, we can copy the source code.
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:55:19
Those bastards force me to use them on certain sites when I want the Google keys
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:08:18
You'll find out for sure! 
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:34:15
No you have days maybe to move them
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:50:38
Circle shows one price while mycelium shows another, or he's looking on blockchain, etc
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:00:22
You should be able to find them but changing addresses in an hd wallet is fine
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:20:39

Thing is you'll never know until it's too late.. But they do torrent and if they're fighting all that dmca I give them credit. But any service can keep logs or have their logs stolen. Some are outright honey pots. Use tor if it's critical.
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:48:44
Incredible like hip hop php of Facebook though they're pulling a blockchain and hiding php and using hiphop vm or hhvm. Ooh php sucks, bullshit, php 7.0 just killed hhvm! Long live php!!! Zuckerburg can suck it.
@_date: 2015-12-20 13:39:15
Well gox wasn't a scam from day one, paycoin was and cryptsy was heavily involved with paycoin, so they paycoined. Also many bitcoiners didn't shitcoin on cryptsy so fallout is small

That's what Homero said. This is a mining contract hidden behind a hedge. Other than probably being a security, things can happen where you can't deliver the bitcoin.

True but I do use the $i usually in a loop
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:08:40
And they're getting paid for it through a pump and dump, brilliant
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:04:19
That's why you need 11.2

Of course it's him

If this fails, I have a great idea for you. Sell at no discount with credit cards. Escrow for 6 months with Andreas key company. People want credit cards, hodlers don't care about 6 months and you can charge 5%. It's a very good business. Please pivot to something that is honest and can be a great business for years.

Nah if you don't get caught, it's fine
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:21:42
Core, give us 2mb so we won't be forced to toonim!! Compromise on one thing! (Also remove rbf)

Search paycoin and see the massive fraud from a fake miner named Homero
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:01:08
Mine's in Virginia
@_date: 2016-01-05 02:58:33
Their minimum is $10k per month or something
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:07:17
I got some blockchains
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:41:22
How about some tokens
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:52:55
You know more than toomin
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:02:19
Probably scam

I feel sorry for the idiots falling for the pump and dump and losing their bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:58:49
It's the same coins

We already moved on and chose bits

@_date: 2016-01-20 08:52:37
It's because they don't trust each other, they all try to be intermediate adding fees and just holding it. The blockchain promises to settle trust between them, but it's private so it's just a database
@_date: 2016-01-22 08:51:36
I'll try my 4790/32gb

Maybe the block number, who knows

A stranger? No. But coinbase actively track you

They kinda stopped 
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:32:40

@_date: 2016-01-03 23:19:07
Because they want to get confidence to do it themself

I don't think bitvisitor ever actually sent anything
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:18:05
It should be 15% of 300. Just tell an accountant the capital gains

Do gigs on backpage or fiverr

Their blockchain is only useful internally to them. Saving them money. Passing it to customers? Lol. None of this competes with Bitcoin.
A USD blockchain is still USD and has no impact on bitcoin. Otoh, if they used our blockchain we'd get a little advertising and demand for some Satoshis.

True Bitpay doesn't care if you use their server and you can also use your own which they'd actually prefer. And private keys are yours. That's nothing like coinbase

Kraken would have made sure that was left behind in the sale. You never buy the corporation with debts. They basically bought the domain, code and clients. That's it.

@_date: 2016-06-15 22:35:53
Why? Use a real wallet like copay and there's no worries

Can I invest with you
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:45:52

@_date: 2016-06-04 05:53:31
Random apps are dangerous
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:19:34
They can't steal your coins
@_date: 2016-06-27 06:31:36
So they'd publish and push the network back many blocks at a time? People didn't notice many confirmations disappearing? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:56:11
I paid 25¢ and it still took a while
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:38:34
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:34:32
It's cheap and devalues itself. Basically it causes inflation because with more free loans going around, it's no big deal to over pay for houses, etc driving prices up. Afterwards massive debt causes a crash.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:34:58
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:34:32
I don't think the coins actually moved yet

It's just a click of a button. You have to have it though. You write down a seed to back it up. Watch some YouTubes

@_date: 2016-06-10 19:39:39
They're trying to build the fee a bit so it pays miners when halvening occurs before increasing block size. 5¢ is healthy
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:53:09
What's your goal
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:57:38
Those miners are the pool
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:33:36
I'd like to do it too
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:12:17

@_date: 2016-06-26 20:50:23

Ohhh that's very different

It'd be cool if it supports an lcd.
Also don't use sd cards, they're small and burn out. Get a blue 1tb $50
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:27:07
No they usually work off chain until you send somewhere, store in copay
@_date: 2016-06-23 14:39:42
Someone made out
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:22:24
They should refund it at some point
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:45:57
Professor bitcorn? 
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:41:25

It's not faster. You just need more confirmations in litecoin. Also no one uses litecoin so the blocks are usually empty. Don't drink the koolaid
Also litecoin creator doesn't understand private keys  big red flag

Circle is good but move purchased coins to a real wallet like copay

Copay is best
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:40:08
In fiat that would be called structuring and is a felony
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:14:58
Like Homero
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:43:27
Coinbase uses off chain until you send outside

I don't think they can shut them all down in 2 weeks
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:03:40
It's pretty safe if you're familiar with multimeters. And no need to turn off power because the only cutting is the extension cords. Much safer than changing wall sockets
@_date: 2016-06-06 11:43:38
Sure but it's better than gold

@_date: 2016-06-01 15:30:14
No you need 240v, look for a dryer or oven socket. Or possibly lethal but find two sockets that are separate phases and grab the two lines.
Get extension cords and try around until you see 240. Cut the ends and rewire into a single output. Don't connect the neutrals. Make sure you ground it correctly or the case will kill you. Actually it's pretty safe at that point. Just don't plug anything else in. Most electronics like 240 though.

It does matter, they're not in agreement vs in agreement

Yup ach is free. Don't do a wire if you actually meant that, but I think you meant ach
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:51:23
Why do people use Etherium
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:47:22
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:01:44
Are you sure? Seeds shouldn't have passwords because you may forget
@_date: 2016-06-27 02:06:46
Png ponzi 
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:44:30
Can't change it, just gotta laugh
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:31:18
With closing the wallet, gdax, and shitcoin, they're desperate for something. I've left them for good.
@_date: 2016-01-09 05:51:39
They're private
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:23:16
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:54:42
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:46:12
You think free money is real?

Gbp bear whale
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:51:27
@_date: 2016-06-07 00:38:30
Yes they'll work forever for unlimited transactions
Relax and use away. And it's more private using new addresses each time you grab one for a different purpose but reuse as you wish
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:20:49
I mean how can he help? You have to do it right? Unless you're hiring him
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:45:28
Sure but it's stupid to keep money on it. They can be raided
@_date: 2016-06-01 07:26:03
I read doom
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:10:38
You guess millions of passwords per second, every 10 minutes (usually when someone guesses the password) the password changes and no one knows it
@_date: 2016-06-09 06:02:47
Wait what? ? It's not a second question mark! Use &amp;
You had me  in their php library

@_date: 2016-06-04 20:34:04
You need the dnm Reddit not here
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:29:36
Panic buy! 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:48:42
That's fine, but hardware still needs a paper backup, you just won't have to use it usually
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:31:07
Don't talk to eth! He's a bad man! Btc loves you more! 
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:19:54
Mine's live bro
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:45:10
Yeah I use them with my debit card, free and instant
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:08:28
No and they're closing it. Use copay, with copay you own the Bitcoins. Coinbase bitcoin aren't yours
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:59:28
What time is it now ?!
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:27:39
2 weeks™
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:54:15
Should've said hero
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:48:07
That's a capital gain
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:40:32
@_date: 2016-06-01 13:51:16
Fees are looking good and secondly we'll be dead
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:29:15
They never ever learn from paycoin to eth to lisk to the next shitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:59:42
New buys want id now, I had to scan the back too
@_date: 2016-06-07 03:56:52
Mine shows links
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:08:36
It means the private key is never on a computer with internet
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:33:04
They have full rights to do it
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:47:27
Cloud mining is a scam
@_date: 2016-06-04 05:28:08
Wrong they're fudding
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:52:16
Yes, watch some YouTube videos
@_date: 2016-06-04 20:27:30

He shot us in the back
@_date: 2016-06-27 05:35:16
This guy wanted an even 2000, I think he's hodling 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:12:25
Hopefully you run out with the device or have the seed with someone trusted. That seed gives them full access though
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:27:30
Copay is my favorite
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:13:57
I suggested reusing one extension receptacle by cutting and splicing
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:27:31
These tokens will work like alt coins. Someone will make an exchange and you'll trade against bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:39:03
What a clown
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:48:53
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:19:05
I almost started buying gold then bitcoin came.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:54:29
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:10:41
Oh I hope you were kidding
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:07:26

Damn from $1.50 to $1.40
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:24:30
Coupon EMCEKEK25 and $5 rebate
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:44:37
Of course
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:06:17
The difference is the dao was a scam and pumped hard
Rootstock should only be tested for years to come
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:18:30
Wow these people are just like the paycoiners
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:26:24
So you only almost cheated on me? 
@_date: 2016-06-19 10:32:07
You looking for shrodingers seed? 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:07:15
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:52:15
Lol bitcoin hasn't even started
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:46:04
That's a smart question, buy a ledger
@_date: 2016-06-01 04:11:51
Where'd they park all their private jets? 
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:34:04
No ach fees except 1%. Circle does free debit
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:29:40
What about noders? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:13:58
I buy more
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:39:51
You send to a bitcoin address
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:25:10
Also copay
@_date: 2016-06-07 02:48:33
100 trillion / 21 million = 4.7 million so no still doable
@_date: 2016-06-07 16:52:35
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:03:43
That's why you pop off the Ethernet, Bluetooth, sound and Wi-Fi chips
@_date: 2016-06-21 05:45:53
@_date: 2016-02-29 02:31:36
There's a fee so there's a chance
@_date: 2016-02-04 02:47:24
Sure use escrow
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:53:23
Use high low
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:40:56

There's lots of python
@_date: 2016-02-09 04:37:11
This is the future, not stupid quantum computers
@_date: 2016-02-19 09:26:12
Yes a node rig that doesn't pay you
@_date: 2016-02-28 13:38:10
No one knows
@_date: 2016-02-19 08:31:12
No never think about it again
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:03:23
Oh he wants to force p2pool. That won't do anything. They'll still be the biggest miners on it.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:56:04
Yeah but many have more and I have 32gb wasted
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:05:37
Yup huge scam
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:33:26
Used to save you 3%
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:55:39
Loanbase, they're incompetent, they probably didn't even hash the passwords
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:29:07
 a lot of food is traded
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:46:48
There's other "writers" who did them, ask Homero
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:26:11
So you did a double shift? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 11:40:51
No because they're not his and you're not American. Pay him new coins
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:07:47
I don't know who's rekted
@_date: 2016-02-23 11:37:06

@_date: 2016-02-20 14:15:29
Very nice, I avoid any business with shitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-22 05:33:51
I trust Luke
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:53:00
It was ok when gas was $6, but they just kept it. It's not a problem on credit cards. But debit especially bitcoin is killer. You can pay inside though without an issue
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:22:59
Haha idiots excited about getting their own money back then blow it on a tv
@_date: 2016-02-28 13:39:44

After selling out our first two sales, we are excited to announce that the next batch of Case has arrived and is on sale! Speaking with users who ordered devices last year, we have made quite a few improvements that we would like to highlight. We have thoroughly tested ways to improve signal strength of each device and improvements were made to the antenna configuration from last years model. There have been improvements made to error messages to better identify when you lose connection or if your fingerprint swipe was unaccepted.  We also include a new QI charger that will decrease charging times with less residual heat. The responsiveness of each input on the device has been improved with increased responsiveness. 
 
Through conversations we have had with customers over the last few months, we are also updating our FAQ to better reflect the how to use your Case and provide answers to more common questions. Changes will be applied to our shipping process during this sale. There will be a Value Added Tax applied on arrival to all orders made to international customers. This is not a new cost but we are providing more details about what each customer should expect when placing their order.
The responses we have from our customers is fantastic and we will work hard to provide our community with the most secure and easy to use bitcoin wallet. Our new sale will continue until supplies last. This includes providing assistance or answering questions that anyone may have about our product or services. We look forward to a hearing from each of our customer. Please feel free to reach out to our team any time through our support email at: support

Pretty sick once more phones support it, my stupid Qualcomm 805 doesn't. I thought they were leaders
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:16:55
@_date: 2016-02-18 09:14:35
I'll never use anything touching shitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:29:57
Panty scene is nice though
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:38:53
It's dumping
@_date: 2016-02-28 03:10:38
I recommend a cars vin + pin, use massive scrypt hashing
@_date: 2016-02-23 11:40:12
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:13:53
In usd mode you can send as bitcoin to a wallet
@_date: 2016-02-27 06:52:50

@_date: 2016-02-01 02:40:02
It's the filthy bankers
@_date: 2016-02-25 09:58:55
Yes a random hash like 23785 rounds will work. Use your car vin + birth date. Sha512 street address number * 1000000 rounds. Not much to forget. Verify with multiple tools to ensure there's no bug in your hashing
@_date: 2016-02-22 07:53:55
He does physical personal service, circle can't touch you like he can. Eg. You enjoy a hug after a purchase

A pump and dump is not an answer to censorship
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:35:45
Bs is my feedback!  Wtf is an area??? I used to be your biggest shill on here and whaletrader chat. They even banned me for shilling Gemini!

@_date: 2016-02-20 10:54:02
Check out  it's the only thing similar
@_date: 2016-02-24 13:36:22
It's stupid that it's not automatic
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:50:22
Why they mention a scam next to bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:32:01
It should work
@_date: 2016-02-28 12:35:11
Same as fiat and an atm card
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:48:45
@_date: 2016-02-07 14:39:23
No why would that need forking
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:57:58
That's fine it's just that they think it's free money
@_date: 2016-02-16 05:04:09
Others would add 1% coming out the same
@_date: 2016-02-29 02:48:02
Yes it's automatic now but still only when tor is there, it doesn't come with tor
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:26:15
I think they had problems when gas was $6 and everyone had a hummer. Also thugs would fill up a line of cars then drive off
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:02:43
Some presidents take down walls, others build them

Yeah I'll stick with core zips
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:55:48
The healthcare industry is like politicians, they hire friends and family to move the money. They hire family as highly paid "janitors" the little brother does IT. Like putins cousins olympic billion dollar road.
@_date: 2016-02-27 02:00:45
Yeah weird. A credit card processor bought them
@_date: 2016-02-03 07:31:10

They split new hardware instead of fighting and bidding up
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:39:03
Arbitrage is exactly what makes exchanges have similar prices, get to it

@_date: 2016-02-05 10:06:39
Nice in depth reporting
@_date: 2016-02-29 00:45:07
Are you running tor? If not then it won't use it
@_date: 2016-02-03 04:59:19
It is, the spammers paid for every transaction. The problem was that they were raising fees for everyone else
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:14:13
Justin bieber owns it? 
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:42:13

It's great people get a bitcoin wallet when searching blockchain

Scum bags are like the guilty remnants of scamming
@_date: 2016-02-07 15:04:04
That won't do anything. They'll still be the biggest miners on it.
@_date: 2016-02-03 03:49:47
They fake mine by buying hashing temporarily and until their exit
@_date: 2016-02-14 08:59:59
Damn when did they turn into a massive shitcoin scam, are they trying to beat Homero? 
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:38:32

Mine's with my gun

But banning euros and bitcoin will end terrorism. Not just a ploy to keep usd used and printed ;)
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:32:14
Sending bitcoin and getting nothing isn't a scam? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 11:42:58

@_date: 2016-02-25 00:01:38
It is what it is, they need to settle the full authorization if needed
@_date: 2016-02-29 03:03:30
This calls for the death penalty

Consider your Bitcoin gone anytime you send it anywhere
@_date: 2016-02-20 01:28:03
Yes it's the same gyft was, looks like they'll get a flood of business
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:52:40
They're not yours
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:31:29
More like 3 with gox
@_date: 2016-02-29 03:50:46
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:32:45
They shitcoined
@_date: 2016-02-29 02:49:22
Some privacy no anonymity
@_date: 2016-02-29 03:05:19
They want id verification to get more I think
@_date: 2016-02-24 13:56:03
Maybe if they fix it
@_date: 2016-02-03 05:07:38
It's negative return

Haha stupid Apple

I call him Ubuntu
@_date: 2016-02-18 00:32:18
Mine's the same
@_date: 2016-02-11 02:39:55
Yes but it's not going to hold a research paper
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:29:08
It's not the default though because my phone starts zoomed in
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:35:47
Shame on him
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:33:50
It can be proven digitally. The stock markets still likes to use paper in 2016 to hide shit. Byrne wants a digital ledger
@_date: 2016-02-05 06:26:28
It's making change addresses
@_date: 2016-02-17 02:20:33
Be careful, sending bitcoin and they don't have to send you anything
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:09:15
You must have a virus or on a phishing site because my password is hidden. Also bofa calls you or makes you call in. If it wasn't you, it was someone close to you who probably had to make another itbit account in your name with your dox

Hope he dumped his paycoin

Yes very nice

Site even has heavy ddos protection but no actual site
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:39:21
Circle is probably just behind
@_date: 2016-02-19 08:16:30
Idk but you do own the key so it's safe
@_date: 2016-02-10 06:30:26
Yet they ignore stolen YouTube videos, you didn't get enough views is the lesson here

That's fine if they own them. Hodlers can buy them cheap and hodl. The whale can't get them back.
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:17:37
Yes you still need responsive pages
@_date: 2016-02-20 00:30:19
Scary but that's fake. I bet it's those wallet shield scams marketing it. Cards stopped being wireless
@_date: 2016-05-28 03:41:08
Hodl strong
@_date: 2016-05-30 00:56:59
They no longer focus on bitcoin and are closing their wallet
@_date: 2016-05-09 02:03:57
Ok I'll try thx

No but some bills take debit
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:15:07
No it's like the fappening
@_date: 2016-05-21 07:42:58
That's their change
@_date: 2016-05-31 10:29:06
Damn I guess Trustlet isn't anymore secure than a regular wallet now. Can trezor get extracted? Or is nxp safer because it's more specialized? 
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:30:12

@_date: 2016-05-19 17:42:53

@_date: 2016-05-05 06:35:55

They math doxxed you
@_date: 2016-05-12 22:26:04
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:17:46
It leads to a scam miner ad

It's free money, why wouldn't they

What do they do
@_date: 2016-05-09 03:51:14
Great service

Don't be greedy

That's small and you bought it, keep it
@_date: 2016-05-10 04:17:49
Ugh I love your username
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:45:22
You can still see it
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:13:05
Ok Satoshi
@_date: 2016-05-28 03:42:44
Goat milk soap
@_date: 2016-05-19 03:32:02
Why's he giving them money
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:18:43
Don't vaccinate me bro! 
@_date: 2016-05-19 03:29:09
The dao is a scam
@_date: 2016-05-20 14:19:03
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:20:03
Selective scam, now try a larger amount and there's no reason for them not to keep your Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-20 13:09:46
No bot good¿
@_date: 2016-05-28 09:14:04
Yup fuck them calling Bitcoin not viable, already emptied my account and using circle
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:33:55
Yeah who cares about markup when they'll retire with 100x
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:50:15
Me too. Why only ban for 30 days? 
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:55:02
Take away their power to enslave through inflation
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:26:55
Linux, php. Do you have phpinfo pages? Sendy? Error pages? Have you turned on I'm under attack? Direct-connect? I obviously can't see the site but I can be your sysadmin for free if it's a good charitable site
@_date: 2016-05-10 04:11:04
Accounts don't really exist, they're more like salted brain wallets. Also you should be testing all this before sending anything big
@_date: 2016-05-08 21:50:43
Miners don't care
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:14:40
So many reputations ruined
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:22:19
No. No one would be here if Bitcoin has flaws or authority
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:41:08
Is it British? 
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:57:08
Convict him to life! 
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:08:28
I can't remember but I got clean
@_date: 2016-05-08 14:01:39
Sure until they get "hacked" while they have your house money
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:28:07
He's planted many things on the internet with fake older dates
@_date: 2016-05-14 05:53:29
He should've hodled instead of going to jail
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:43:40
Wow though I feel like they should work on armory instead. Separate the functions
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:21:51
No! He needs to blog first
@_date: 2016-05-12 03:26:13
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:31:59
Don't be greedy because scammers will use it against you
@_date: 2016-05-15 02:02:52
I mean they'll steal the patent. But you're right, no one outside China will use the patent and inside will be stolen so they'll be put out of business quickly
@_date: 2016-05-17 12:33:48
Wow what's that gauge library
@_date: 2016-05-13 02:20:36
Maybe 0 isn't valid? There's also many derivitations. What's the default on your library?

@_date: 2016-05-21 15:22:48
Try it
@_date: 2016-05-07 08:24:00
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:05:36
That's lunch money
@_date: 2016-05-11 04:46:57
So Satoshi will definitely be losing his coins? That's kinda cool because his million are a risk to everything and the only thing I didn't like about Bitcoin.
Sure he deserves it but that's horrible distribution and who knows who has access.

 Copay is a much better wallet and you own your keys
@_date: 2016-05-04 04:02:15
Don't you have any morals? There's bad governments who will take Bitcoins freedom and turn digital money into slavery
@_date: 2016-05-28 09:16:04
Oh op wasn't joking? It's like a shitcoin mind fuck
@_date: 2016-05-29 11:48:01

Yeah they're pretty legit
@_date: 2016-05-28 09:02:07
No we must make up new coins every day! 
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:21:52
They'll refund you but they are getting shady and now they're shitcoining, I think they're in trouble and desperate for cash flow.
 Accidents like these seem intentional lately. They're using customers as free loans. When companies shitcoin you get paycoin and cryptsy fraud.
@_date: 2016-05-31 00:23:00
Hopefully China is nicer but I think they want to mine Africa then leave.
@_date: 2016-05-09 03:47:10
Extremely safe, but never use it directly! Always hash with random cycles. Eg 2,753,643,789,446 trillion billion times of sha512. Remember this number. You want this taking 10 minutes at minimum
@_date: 2016-05-09 03:54:23
And get 1 star

No the first will confirm and is legit. You're done
@_date: 2016-05-31 07:11:42
How will we fiat??
@_date: 2016-05-10 18:59:33
Use copay

What about paycoin, ccn? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:14:42
No those values are your private keys, Satoshi can't do anything at all. And he may have 1 million coins, not 21.

That's pretty small, are you sure it's hitting your ip? CloudFlare may just be forwarding because it's so small and you don't have I'm under attack on. You need to use ssl authentication to protect your ip as a last resort

Well yes if he moves them then that's cool. I just wish we could get it over with. I don't think they'll ever move though and hate the risk always being there.

Agreed, Gavin for some reason or another is siding with a scammer. The Craig supporters sound identical to the delusional paycoin supporters. 
I've never seen people actively scam themselves before these two situations. It's actually scary to see so many people act like that. Homero and Craig have hypnotic powers or something.

@_date: 2016-05-21 12:15:27
Shitcoin can't compete either because they compete against themself. Eg. A litecoiners thinks it's the best then eth pumps, then another pumps and so on. 
Shitcoiners are always chasing pumps and lose everything. They don't deserve bitcoin and I hope they lose it all.
Shitcoin are experiments for future integration into bitcoin. Gullible idiots get caught in the pump and dumps. It's sad but they deserve to lose their bitcoin if they can't hodl.
It's sick to see coinbase and gemini taking advantage of the situation. But these idiots are giving away their money, might as well take it I guess.

Eth is shitcoin being pumped and dumped. It has 0 application in the real world in the near future.
Even if it was useful, run your apps on a clone/integrate into bitcoin with much cheaper "gas". The higher eth is the more reason not to use it. It's incredible how dumb the investors are.
The dao is a circle jerk of apps investing in apps for pumps sake. Paycoiners at least knew it was a scam, eth users/pumpers actually think eth is useful. Eth doesn't actually have users. Participating in a pump isn't using it. Eth has no use right now. The dao isn't a use, it's a pump. It's not even a currency.

Eth is etc
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:17:21
I'm a leader of etc and to be crystal clear this has nothing to do with bitcoin. R/btc was foaming at the mouth with delusions.
This is about being immutable. I'd like for bitcoin to get bigger blocks but I can wait. No one is forking bitcoin unless we agree. And there won't be a fork chain because etc only exists to make ethf immutable.
People are fudding all kinds of delusions about bitcoin forking. Bitcoin will get bigger blocks when it's ready. This is about bitcoin immutable ethos only.
I only joined etc to fight for immutability. See 
And I was triggered when eth thought they'd ever beat bitcoin. Bitcoin is rock solid and it's important to note the great fee market developing which can guide us to bigger blocks in the future just like core devs said.

Pretty much, why building a fee market is critical and going well
@_date: 2016-07-30 03:29:01
Ridiculous. Why are they desperate for fees and to pump eth?

How exactly is their shitcoin going to beat bitcoin? It almost lost $150 million in seconds, being pumped and dumped, hyper inflation, not immutable, premined, and massive supplies. And they want pos so the owners can syphon more value out.
All they're missing is a lock up period like paycoin and onecoin so the owners can dump, oh wait they had the doa which burned to the ground
All the dao are scams which will go bankrupt, they had a roulette game which can be forked out by the govt by holding vitalik in contempt until he forks again since he has no excuses now
They're already ready for doa round 2, they might be dumber than paycoiners
@_date: 2016-07-24 07:57:51

Forking crime out may have its merits. The only dapp I saw on dao is roulette. Say gambling becomes huge.
1. Fbi visits vitalik telling him to stop gambling so he forks to ethfbi.
2. Investors want their money back so they want another fork ethf2.
How many forks will it take? All the proforkers will choose which fork?
Was a precedent set legally? Vitalik can no longer claim decentralized.
