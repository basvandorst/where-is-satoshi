You're not the only one who took a massive dump tonight

Just sold half a btc...seemed like a good idea...might not be though...and ain't that the truth :) A 1000 rise in a few hours seems like a good place to drop some BTC :/ Hodling for hodling's sake seems a bit foolish when you can make an honest profit!

On Tue Feb 6th in the morning, with Bitcoin and the other Cryptos sinking to October levels (Bitcoin at $6000) I posted something of a rallying cry on here to buy and HLOD due to my love for Bitcoin as the 'people's currency' - a decentralised alternative to the totalitarian debt-based central banking slave system - more in hope than expectation bc at that moment I truly believed it was game over...And honestly, even if this is short-lived, I feel like I'm witnessing a miracle and I can't tell you how happy I am to see such a dramatic turnaround this week...RIIIIISE BTC!! BACK FROM THE DEAD HAHAAAAA :D (Queue Crash XD ..Bit drunk don't care :P)

As a (very) left-wing Economist I had v high hopes that Crypto would start an alternative decentralised payment system outside the failed debt-based central banking system, free at the point of use, and would render the current financial system redundant (which it already is for all but those who produce the money). Sadly, the financial establishment has inevitably stamped on the flower that was growing through the cracks in the dystopian concrete. I'm sad - not just bc I lost some $$$$$ - to hell with my money! - I'm sad bc I feel like all the sellers missed the point. We were supposed to hold (or HLOD if you prefer) not bc we wanted to make a quick buck, but bc this innovation represented so much more. It was: Freedom from debt-based slavery. Hope that we could overcome our financial masters. And Belief that we could take back control of our lives.  Feel free to post words of encouragement or irreverent sarcasm...if we don't buy and HLOD, we are truly our Masters Keepers!

Does anyone believe this is an issue which I can fix myself? I have cleared Cache and restarted phone and app. I'm guessing its an issue with them not me but I could be wrong

Cant buy or sell to coinbase from my Bitpay App...so bc of a comm issue between the two my Bitcoin is trapped in my wallet...add to that the fees that Coinbase charge and the weeks it takes to get any kind of tech support from them, I'd say they are pretty crappy. Stick to Revolut or Kraken imho

Bit of a speculative question but wondering if any of you guys have had this before...Trying to sell my Bitcoin on Bitpay. When I click on Coinbase and Sell then put in the amount it says "Connecting to Coinbase" then "Error. Unknown error" and won't connect. Also, when I try to buy Bitcoin it says "Error. The access token is invalid." I have bought and sold many times this way previously. Any ideas what's going on?

My Boss wants to get rid of his Bitcoin bc he believes it is heading for much lower levels...rightly or wrongly...I said pay me in Bitcoin this month and I'll liquidate same as I always do...Now I'm stuck with it and none too happy! I don't want to get caught holding the Bitcoin at the end of the day, regardless of whether it goes up or down, I just want my wages in my Bank asap!
So there is a Server time sync issue between Bitpay and Coinbase and that's stopping transactions at this time?

Not trying to be my own Bank just doing my Boss a favour bc I thought I could sell BTC immediately as has previously been the case...suffice it to say this is the last favour I do for him bc this is pathetic! Just waiting for feedback from Bitpay who don't work weekends and Coinbase who quoted 5 biz days before a reply but could be indefinite due to workload! The tech and support provided by these exchanges are too overwhelmed by the demands placed upon them clearly!
