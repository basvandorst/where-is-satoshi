1) Bitcoin can upgrade for more secure encryption.
2) Name one thing the government successfully banned.
3) More and more people are learning about how fiat money is rigged and turning to bitcoin.

Cuz, u can’t. Keep living in your little wonderland where all the major companies address everyone of it’s millions of users issues publicly.
@_date: 2019-10-08 17:29:58
No company with 30 million users is gonna address one individual’s issue publicly if that’s what you’re seeking.

Exactly what issue are you referring to? Is it an major event or a scandal they haven’t addressed? Or some idiot joe complaining about him losing his coins due to his own stupidity? What haven’t they addressed exactly?

It’s true. Apple is not gonna make no public statement because some Joe is having trouble with his iphone. Microsoft is not gonna make public statement because the same Joe can’t install latest Windows. That’s not how it works.
@_date: 2019-10-03 13:22:05
It will blow everyone’s mind like it has previously. Bitcoin always tends to do the unexpected. People that were calling $5,000-$8,000 last halving were ridiculed but then it went to $20,000.
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:55:28
If it does reach $16,000... OP, u gonna eat your dick or no?
@_date: 2019-10-11 23:12:27
this is the same guy that called $1,000 btc back in 2018?
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:06:58
Pshhhhh... Funny how bitcoin goes down 7% in a day and people think it’s end of the world. Bring back the days of 40% crashes in a day!!!

Coinbase is a solid exchange. I’ve been using it many years since Gdax with ZERO problems. They have 30 million users. The complaints you read about are tiny, micro fraction of that. And majority of them are their own fault or the banks they deal with. It also doesn’t help that there are many haters here in this subreddit.

How does one make a stupid mistake like this? I’m always checking double checking and triple checking the address letter by letter when im sending btc even just a few satoshis.

I’ve noticed when btc was at 20k, the last post on first page of this subreddit had 100-200 upvotes(when sorted by TOP)... during the recent bear market it went down to 10 or less. Now, ever since recovering from 4k, it doubled to around 15-20 upvotes.
@_date: 2019-06-04 04:01:43
I don’t lose because I don’t sell in these short term dips. I sell HIGH. How do i lose? You loose because you sell low and your loss is someone else’s gain. That’s how money works. More you sell low, more money people like me make. Hahaha!

@_date: 2019-09-30 13:31:59
Bitcoin is still at its early stages. Like emails back in the 90’s. And all the events you mentioned don’t seem significant enough to cause any effect on price of bitcoin. They don’t have any effect on stock market so why would they effect bitcoin...? A major market crash or an economic crisis in a major global economy would be a different story.

@_date: 2019-09-28 02:31:08
I had to re-read this post three times and i still don’t get it. The title says “there is no manipulation” which is clearly wrong(bitcoin is a heavily manipulated market), then you go on saying: “They have more BTC, they should have more power”, so you are saying it’s ok for them to manipulate the market because they own more btc? What is the point of this post? Are you saying people should stop complaining about market manipulation because the whales have the right to manipulate it?
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:13:21

First, you did compare bitcoin to lottery which wasn’t very smart... Secondly, putting money into something and “coming out on top” would mean smart to many people.

Why so bearish?
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:24:34
Honest truth is because the price is driven by traders. And the more volatile,the more money can be made. Money can only be made only when there’s a sucker willing to sell for less. Thus the fomo, fud, manipulations, etc. That’s how money works.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:29:13
So what happened? $9k and plunged down to $8,600 in matter of minutes... Doesn't seem normal?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:42:58
If it doesn’t break above $8,300 for the third time, it’s in for a major pull back
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:36:02
There are ways to get away without paying taxes. And getting paid in Bitcoin is MUCH easier to get away. If you have no clue, YOU have no idea how taxes work, just ask Trump.
