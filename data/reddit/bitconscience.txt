You're correct in this case - I'm not banned, just doing my annual alias change. That doesn't mean the cleansing isn't very real though.

You see, they could easily add enough capacity to allow these transactions to confirm after an hour or so, but it's more fun to toy with the network until it's useless and people go somewhere else.

Some people are experiencing confirmation delays as a result of ~~congestion and improperly calculated fees~~ inadequate block sizes.

It's around 62GB now. I think  shows the current number under the blocks tab.

I think we'd have to begin with the Satoshi coins before we even begin to look at the rest of the coins... Does Satoshi plan to spend his coins some day or are they lost forever?

Be warned that many people consider this an abuse of the blockchain, but the ability exists. You can use OP_RETURN to encode a message. Learn more at

There is absolutely no way to calculate the number of coins that are lost to circulation and there will never be a way to calculate that number. The reason is that idle coins are indistinguishable from stored coins. I mined coins in early 2011 that have never moved - no one can look at them and know if I still have the private keys to access the coins.. hell, I don't even know if I have them anymore.

You've got balls, I'll give you that. I'd say the good news is that this hype will likely translate into even more fomo Friday before it cools off for the weekend.
