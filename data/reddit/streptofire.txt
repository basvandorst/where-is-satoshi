I think much closer to fascism than capitalism or communism, actually.
Even though you are saying the FED is "private", it is "private" in a fascist way, not in a capitalistic way.
Socialists want the government directly controlling the institutions, fascists want the government indirectly controlling the institutions (they are "private" but heavily regulated and with a very strong state interference), while capitalists want no government control at all.
An actual capitalistic banking system wouldn't function like the FED, it would be more like this: anyone can open a bank and create their own currencies, each bank could set their own interest rates, any person could lend money to anyone freely, etc. There wouldn't exist a central planner of the economy which forces all banks to adopt certain practices forcefully.

You know, I'm an anarcho-capitalist myself and this is one of the rare occasions where I agree with a communist.
Something I was thinking now is that both ancaps and communists recognize the big problem that is the coalition between state and big corporations. The difference between them is who they blame for that. Ancaps mainly blame the government, while communists mainly blame the big corporations.
Despite that, crypto gives some hope of attacking that system (but not necessarily destroying it completely). Even though we may disagree whether the enemy is the state or the big corporations, we agree that this technology is a great step forward against it.
In my vision, blocking off competition and adopting monopolistic practices is only possible with a state. Without a state, the free market capitalist system I described is possible, since none of the big banks can do anything to stop a common person from opening a micro-bank and freely doing business. Without a state to coercively enforce a monopoly, nothing can stop anyone from lending money to other people with a much lower interest rate than the big banks (and thus, breaking their monopolies). That's why I support the abolition of the state.

No, state enforced capitalism is corporativism, not free market capitalism.
The decentralized and free system you are describing is what capitalism actually is.

Unless you like centralization, this should not be regarded as good news.

I'm not a bcasher and I don't like the people in My point still stands. Do you prefer a single coin monopolizing the market or healthy competition between multiple coins, which helps all of them to improve?

Yeah, I only thought of this a few hours after I made this post.
