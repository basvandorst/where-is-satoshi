@_date: 2019-07-18 16:54:47
Im debating to sell, (But i do like to look at things from the bigger picture, hodl for a few more years)
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:02:04
Are those save?
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:45:27

@_date: 2019-07-21 13:36:13
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:01:29
Nah no Fomod, i bought in at the dip (Yesterday)
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:30:12
Is it hard to settup keepkey after you have bought it?
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:22:37
Ah, thank you for educating me
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:56:58
what would this low be you reckon?
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:00:16
Would bitcoin core be a good one?
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:27:22
Very true, but there is more Fomo right now right? More demand for it? So it could go 10x right?
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:21:27
I think you right
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:53:09
Go make a video about this? Because this all got me confused the big spike.
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:14:24
Thank you, tbh, i always feel like, if i sale right now and lets so make a few profit.... And the price rises crazy etc... i cant ever forgive myself to "sale early and be creedy". I think im just gonna hodl for a few years.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:21:12
But are they hard to configure? etc... Or is it easy to drop your coins on and out?
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:32:36

@_date: 2019-07-20 17:11:33
Would ledger be good too?
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:48:32
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:21:55
Yeah, but will it actually do much about the price?
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:21:13
So it could very much double the 20k?
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:38:07
Much love! Now to the moon!
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:31:53
Are those free?
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:34:11
Yeah true! But if you got btc in 2016 you made a nice profit, for me right now its not worth it :P I dont care about small quick earnings. I will hodl a few years like you too
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:26:19
But there is more "Hype" This time right? More fomo? More demand?
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:34:23
ah oke thank you for educating me, think i do have to buy one then :P
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:12:15
I know it will crash. BUT I WONT SELL! STAY STRONG MY FELLOWS!
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:45:37
Very true, but why would anyone use bakkt tho? Like why buy btc through bakkt?
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:24:19
I'm in ETN, CS, TPAY - do you suggest any other projects?
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:21:34
Yes, i have some alt coins, but im starting to get some fear of missing out on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:22:58
HELL YA!
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:20:37
wait, english is not my first language what do you mean with:  after having on the May 2020
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:24:43
So small steady buys
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:58:25
Chief please... ? :)
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:48:07
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:31:38
Yes! I know some stuff about different alt coins etc, where should i start to expand my knowledge on bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:23:51
Right yeah... Prolly get some extra money next month, will invest that too! So that would be around 300-400bucks. Then slowly invest more over time.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:21:57
The thing is, i'm a student i still live with my parents they dont want me to spend it on bitcoins etc, i do have some alt coins but they say enough is enough.... But i do think differently about it ;P
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:18:15
My personal goal is, to get some money to help my parent out. They always helped me when i was a small baby and i wanna return to them. + I want some money to keep investing with. So i guess 100 aint enough.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:27:17
Yes, i used to do graphic designs when i was younger (5years ago) Got paid, right now i'm an editor (I study film) Just edited my first music video. So deffo some skills but i have never looked in getting paid with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:18:52
Yeah :P dw, i got you ;P Yeah i only have a spare 100laying around rn, would be my first investment in bitcoin, not sure if i need to invest more to see some sort of an alright profit
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:36:05
Thanks man!!! WOW this comunity is really nice!
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:57:00
Yeah i see a massive increase this month, so next month prolly a correction i would say
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:29:38
Do you guys think btc is gonna get a correction or is it gonna bounce between 7-9k?
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:58:07
Yeah true, but i rather buy more now since i'ts a relative cheap price... BUT its a high in a longtime tho... not sure if i should wait for some dips?
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:30:16
Do you guys think its gonna get a price correction? Or should i go buy now?
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:19:25
You think 21 we are having another new high?
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:18:54
HAHA! True!!
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:19:44
Is it still worth to mine bitcoin? i do have a 1080 TI msi
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:25:05
Haha, i felt like... maybe you guys know more stuff then me (yall prolly do)
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:48:38
Right, would you suggest to wait till its correction?
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:18:00
Then it will just stay around 9-10k?
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:23:44
