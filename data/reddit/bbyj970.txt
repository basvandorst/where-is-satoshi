Coinbase is secure, and based in the US (SF, I believe). Been using them for a year or so now
Edit: only issue I've really had isn't necessarily security related, but stability during big swings.

Cheapest way to get into bitcoin would be to just signup for a coinbase.com account. Coinbase is an exchange that allows you to purchase Bitcoin with either a bank transfer or credit card (for a fee of course). I'd honestly just use the wallet they provide with your account.

What I would give to be 16 and have the drive and the hustle to build a machine that would make me passive income.
Unfortunately, the other redditors here are right. You'll never make your money back. Look into other side hustles and use your earnings to buy bitcoin. Cut grass, buy/sell stuff online, whatever. 
At your age, investing into crypto now gives you a huge jump on the rest of your peer group.

I'm having a difficult time understanding your argument

I second that. Coinbase has its issues but has been pretty reliable for me thus far. Good luck!

I feel the same way about it. Forget the nice meals and toys now. We'll get them 10 fold later on.
I had a very bad habit of going out to lunch with coworkers, probably 3 days a week. Now when asked, I decline and instead put that 10-15$ into crypto. Doesn't seem like much, I know, but it adds up to about $100-150 extra a month.

'Decentralized Jesus.' Nice. Now anyone can profit off of Jesus, not just Southern Baptist TV preachers!

Hasn't China "banned" bitcoin multiple times, already? I guess I'm confused why this is any different
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:00:31
Can someone explain why China banned Google and Facebook a few years ago? 
Edit: I guess I'm more interested in how long the bans lasted.

It's because they're in the same sector. Coins of a feather often rise/fall together.

A bitcoin must remain faceless. A bitcoin is no one. If a bitcoin is truly no one, it has nothing to fear.
