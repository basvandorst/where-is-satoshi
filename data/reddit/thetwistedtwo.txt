Tbh, this seems like more trouble than it's worth. I've been harassed for the past few months, and it's going to get a hell of a lot worse. *Cheers*

The coins are from 2013, not the bitfinex hack. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:52:34
I know absolutely nothing about Bitfinex, other than the fact that they were hacked. I know very little about computers, coding, hacking, or anything else. I just recently got into Bitcoin, so I'm not even very knowledgeable on BTC itself XD Which is probably why I just had to change all of my passwords, after I was hacked twice. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:59:32
I honestly have no idea how to do that. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:04:46
Because I received Bitcoin and wanted to see if I could make more?
It was dumb, because exactly zero of the loan recipients repaid the loan. 
Read the thread, and start from the beginning XD I didn't know how to do a Bitcoin signature, and I looked idiotic.

I'm not his alt, and I could do a live stream or something of the sort to prove it, if you'd like.

Bitch. 
Oh look! Now we've both insulted each other and claimed things we couldn't possibly know. :)

Is YouTube alright? Or, I suppose google hangouts would be fine.

I deleted all of my history. I've made a lot of mistakes in the past, but I moved on a long time ago. I'm still being harassed, and with this new influx of people, I don't want to put up with it. Probably seeks pretty sketch, but I have enough to deal with already. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:02:21
The first one. I guess the person that hacked my account edited it.

If everyone could come to a consensus on a site, I will use whatever is chosen, as long as it's secure. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:32:30
I didn't write the comment that was edited. Someone got into my account. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:55:02
Can you link me to that? Someone got into my Reddit, and I had to jump through hoops to get it back. 
No, I'm not the hacker. I'm technologically challenged, and I'm not even really knowledgable about BTC. 
The poor choices I referenced were unrelated to all of this.

Bb, you know you love me ❤��
EDIT 2.0: Stop fucking hacking my fucking account. Mind your own damn business, and thanks for the inconveniences. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:09:01
I was struggling a few months ago. I stopped with that bullshit almost immediately after it happened. I made poor decisions, and a friend helped me out in my time of need. I stopped, and I regret it.  It affected my family, and fucked my life over.

The grammar is similar for a reason nobody seems to understand. Maybe there's something more than being me, how about you ask me instead? Not too hard :)
Love is found in strange places.

I've heard a lot of people say that these coins came from 2013. I can't verify this, because I have no fucking idea how to. But I don't think they're from the hack, just seeks like a ploy for attention. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:33:31
Pm me and we can set something up.
