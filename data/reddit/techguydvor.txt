breaking captchas with OCR is not an issue. Paying indians to solve captchas for $0.001 per captcha with a 100% success rate is the problem.

This is a serious concern. I know that in reddits case they could immediately convert all donations to USD. However, bitcion will not become a real currency with strong adoption until the fiat conversion step is not necessary. In order for that to happen corporate users need to be able to reliable store bitcoin for longer than 5 minutes.

Where is the information on your site?

Agreed. Its bad form to drag intersango into this. You should delete this post.

It costs very little and it depends on the state. In most places it will cost &lt; $75. The loser will pay any cost and the time it takes to file / show up (a couple hours) can be included as part of the damages.

So do you the same with Euros or Yuan or RMB? It seems silly to quote the current USD spot price in relation to bitcoin. Why don't they list the bitcoin price next to USD so that we can tell the value of USD when we look back?

Its a simple case of know your audience. I read spanish and live in a spanish country. If I post on an english site I am not going to use spanish or germany or icelandic. Its pretty stupid and narrow-minded to be so egoistical to expect all the english speakers here to translate this. A global currency does not mean everyone needs to learn everyone elses languages. Until Spanish speakers outnumber english speakers in this subreddit then expect spanish posts to be downvoted into oblivion.

Then the WTO will have to send the WTO police task force to jail every single member country of the WTO that controls the supply of their own currency. Oh yeah, the WTO has no police force, has no power, and does nothing to stop every member country's manipulation of their own currency.

Cool, I want you to give me a sample of your blood.... Its cool if you dont want to. It just means you are a pedophile, are hiding HIV from your wife or a myriad of other things. Any normal sane person would submit themselves to blood tests whenever asked for any reason or no reason... if they have no criminal or unethical dealings that is.

Except a cash register is MUCH easier to secure. 1) only one employee has access to most cash registers at a time. If it is short, you know who stole the money 2) Even if the register is not secure, have you ever noticed stores have cameras on cash registers? This is to hold those employees accountable.
With bitcoin, there is not an easy solution to this problem currently.

Not really, when customer A hands cash to employee B, there is a clear trail. If the cash goes missing prior to depositing in the bank or is not in the register at the end of the shift, etc, then it can be deduced employee B lost / stole the cash.
If customer A hands bitcoins to employee B, and those bitcoins go missing, no one knows who took them. It might be a hacker, an old employee with the private keys, the employee themself, the CFO who also has the wallet keys, etc.

Germany really isn't benefited by the Euro at all. All Germany would have to do to lower their own exchange rate is print more money the same way the US has been to spur its export industries. Problem solved.

Not really. The number of hacks on bitcoin businesses is huge because the handlers are either unethical or do not know proper security. Of course its impossible to say whether it was an inside or outside job, but it does not really from the perspective of a business. Imagine you are a company and you get hacked and lose a months revenue. That is a big issue and it is not something that happens using normal banks.

You are right it is neither random or secure. If you generate your own random seed using something like keepass, then you are good to go. But if you decide to use a 10 word sentence from Pride and Prejudice or your favorite quote spelled in 1337 or some other none sense, then you are just waiting to have your coins stolen.
The shitty part about deterministic wallets is if someone generates the same seed as you then all your addresses are compromised. Even in the bitcoin wallet if someone hits the lottery and generates the same key as you, then they only have access to one address not all 10,000 of your addresses.

Exactly. Why exchanges are not doing this simple thing is insane.

The bitcoin method is cheaper than the current system.
Mining will not always be 10% of market cap. If bitcoin is moving the equivalent of 1 trillion dollars back and forth every year, then only a very small fraction of that needs to be spent to secure the network. There is a fixed cost to secure the network.
Mining by thousands of computers is not required by bitcoin. Technically, if everyone was happy with zero security, one computer could easily handle all the mining. Its all about how much protection people want from a 51% attack. As bitcoin grows, the amount of protection needed compare to the transaction value will decrease substantially.

The primary reason I do not accept bitcoin is because the economy is not big enough. The price of my products are &gt; $60. There just are not a lot of people that have more than $60 worth of bitcoins. Most people have 1-2 bitcoins and there are a few people that have several thousand. Not a very big market.
@_date: 2012-08-29 01:50:19
Not at all. Look up in corporate environments will cash is received and you will see there are cameras. Cash requires a thief to be physicall present (and recorded on camera) while bitcoins do not.
@_date: 2012-12-17 22:52:55
Exactly. I am in sort of recycling coins. Imagine 50 years from now when 50% of coins are lost. Suddenly, in a span of a year, those old wallets are cracked and the money supply of bitcoin has now doubled. Talk about risky!
@_date: 2012-08-28 03:26:14
Yes, I am aware of multi-sig transactions, but that is hardly usable right now. Once it is usable and fully tested it will be an awesome future.

Yeah, the US is really screwing up with this. My friend who has not lived in the US in 4 years, pays over $100k in taxes for no benefits to himself (as he receives no US services), has had enough. He is renouncing his citizenship over this issue. The US has turned into an invasive and oppressive regime not worthy of its citizens

And what happens when the person in charge of the wallet has the wallet "hacked?" Or if multiple peopke control the wallet, what happens when one of them steals all the coins and no one can prove which did it?
Bitcoin is not ready for the corporate environment righ tnow.
@_date: 2012-08-08 01:53:03
Good point. I did not consider that increased difficulty will make botnets switch to more profitable activities.
@_date: 2012-08-07 23:53:34
Not really. I doubt there will be a huge amount of people buying ASICs. Video cards are one thing (they have other uses), but an ASIC has no other use than bitcoin mining and virtually no resale value. I do not think ASICs will make a considerable dent in mining for at least a year.
A much more worrisome trend than ASICs for a profitable rig is mining on zombie computers. These people do not care what hardware costs / electricity costs since they are using resources of other people. This, in time, will make mining so difficult it is not profitable.
@_date: 2012-08-28 03:36:19
Almost any company can do that as long as it never intends to spend bitcoins. However, the ecosystem that most in want is where bitcoin is a real currency equal to the USD. This requires companies to hold it to buy other things with it than yet another currency. In addition, immediate conversion to USD has exchange rate risk and additional fees (or development costs) that normal methods do not.
Brain wallets, cold wallets, [insert other marketing buzz] wallet, etc do not solve the issue from my view. Won't there still be people who have access to these wallets at some point who can get the private keys and spend anonymously? (Maybe just spend the whole wallets contents as a mining fee or to a non-existant address just to get revenge on the company).
Multi-sig transactions will go along ways to stop this, but that is not currently very usable at the moment.

Not really. All he needs to do is go to small claims court and they will forced to pay him. The process is very easy and really it is something that should be taught in public schools so that corporations cannot so easily take advantage of individuals.
If this is not a US corp, then it does make it more difficult. For that he will need to go through his bank.
@_date: 2012-08-28 21:59:32
It is not. That is why the corporate world uses cards and checks. The very rare instances cash is ever used, one person is given the cash, so if it turns up missing then it is easy to know who took it.
Other times a corporation handles cash it is going in a register or is being handled to an authorized user which must issue a receipt to the customer, which creates an easy trail to determine if there is theft.

Actually they are responsible. The overdraft and what follows are his damages to them violating the contract. He agreed for them to take $75. Not $225. So, any damages he suffers is actually their fault.

Local currencies. Specifically, the ability to go to an ATM and get local currency out of the ATM anonymously using bitcoins
@_date: 2013-01-07 05:44:34
Currency does not matter. Whatever the local is. So, in thailand the thai baht and in the US the US dollar.
The thing is, this is THE killer app for bitcoin. Its going to take a LOOOONG time before taxies, restaurants, landlords, etc accept bitcoin. Look how fast real businesses are adopting bitcoin and extrapolate it. You are looking at decades.
Several thousand well placed ATMs in a country can be just as good as convincing a few million businesses to accept bitcoin. Just place the ATMs and it makes bitcoins immediately useful to spend.
