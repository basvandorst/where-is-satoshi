Check out You could buy an Amazon Gift Card and sell it for Bitcoin. You have to go first since you're new and haven't established trust yet on your account, but so long as you trade with reputable traders, you'll have no problem. You can buy Amazon Gift Cards at your local grocery store to sell to them. I've used it numerous times and never had a problem. Just make sure to read the sidebar and be careful for scammers.
Just an FYI, Amazon Gift Cards have some of the best resale value of any gift cards. Except for maybe Apple Gift Cards (different from iTunes Gift Cards). Amazon is always in high demand though and easy to find at a local grocery store. With Amazon GC's, you'll probably get somewhere around 80-90% return on the value of the card. Not a perfect solution, but probably as good as you'll get.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:05:26
Yeah. You would post your trade like this:

If you have free electricity, it's definitely worth it. However, for example, if I had just spent my money on Bitcoin instead of buying a rig, my money would have tripled. As of now, I'm still $1000 from profitability.
Basically, if you already have a gaming computer, you might as well. If not though, just buy Bitcoin instead.

Have an existing Bitcoin wallet with coins in them at the time of the fork. Make sure you're holding the private keys to the wallet and they aren't being held by an exchange or online wallet. You will get both coins after the fork.

Not worth it on just a CPU. Only bother if you have a GPU.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:54:57
You need an ASIC miner and cheap electricity. The only miners worth getting are $1000+ and ship from China and are hard to get a hold of. For the average person in the US without either free or industrial priced power, mining is not worth it.
However, if you are interested in mining still and have a reasonably powerful home computer, you might want to check out [NiceHash]( It's a very simple to use mining program that you can run on a home PC that connects to their online hashing market. You basically sell your computer's hashing power to help others mine altcoins like Etherium, Zcash, and that kind of thing and you get paid out in Bitcoin.
Few things to note. With NiceHash, you aren't actually mining coins yourself. You are selling your computational power to others in exchange for Bitcoin. In addition, you need a computer with a powerful modern GPU (Graphics Card). CPU's are just not good enough at mining to be worthwhile anymore. Also, before you get any wild ideas, mining on a laptop is NOT viable and will just result in vastly diminished battery life.
[Here is an example of my 5 GPU \(GTX 1070s\) mining rig on NiceHash.]( If you end up just testing it out, feel free to mine to my address :D
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:25:14
It was funny
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:02:42
There is a dedicated NiceHash subreddit at that will be more helpful. Also, why mine on a CPU? You wont get a payout from NiceHash for at least half a year anyway. The electricity is way more expensive than the profits and the damage to the CPU is certainly not worth it.
To answer your question, try maxing out your CPU fan and/or undervolting.

I've got a 6 GPU mining rig. If you need processing power, I'd be willing to run your recovery program on it for you if you'd compensate me for my lost mining time. Not sure if there's a way to do that so it would be secure for you though (so there's no chance of me stealing it since I don't trust internet strangers either).
Edit: According to [this]( it's possible for me to help you crack it without leaving your account vulnerable.


@_date: 2019-10-31 07:39:36


Not blockchain, just Bitcoin. One of the biggest stand out features of Bitcoin, at least in my opinion is that there is no known creator to voice opinion and rally around. Having a leader is not very decentralized.


They would be in control of a substantial amount of cryptocurrency giving them strong economic control and political control. Many foreign powers will not like this and having the leader proactively taken care of may seem worth it to them to prevent future problems. Personally, I don't think they'd be "murdered". They'll probably be suicided Epstein style.
This is all conjecture of course and Vitalik Buterin is alive and well, but I think Bitcoin is a different beast.

What dip? WE'RE BACK!!!!
To answer your question though, a bunch of big corporations supporting Bitcoin Cash (competing crypto) bought a bunch of BCH (Bitcoin Cash) to raise the price. This resulted in BTC miners switching to mining BCH because it had bigger profits.
Within the next 24 hours however, BCH will have a mining difficulty adjustment that will make BTC the more valuable coin to mine again. However, in the meantime, a bunch of money that was pumped into BCH is being sold off quickly to take fast profits with the hopes that enough miners will stay on BCH to make it take over as the main BTC.
I personally believe that BCH will decrease in value over time and this "pump and dump" scheme will fail. However, that's just my uneducated opinion. Read up and form your own opinions.
It's very important to keep in mind, that this subreddit and are both extremely biased and regularly spread propaganda. This sub supports BTC and supports BCH. Both argue that theirs will win and the other will disappear. Time will tell.

Colemak took me 3 months to get back to my regular typing speed.

I hadn’t considered that. Are you not required to report the addresses your coins are in though? I’m not familiar with crypto tax laws.
Also, why not accept a more privacy focused coin like Monero? Do you take anything other than Bitcoin?

No my point is, the US Dollar can't be backed by Bitcoin. The last thing the USD was actually backed by was gold. That was because the US treasury had actual gold that your dollar represented.
Now lets consider that with Bitcoin. You'd be suggesting that the US government has a whole bunch of Bitcoin saved up in a wallet and your piece of paper dollar note represents that Bitcoin. What possible advantage does that have over just using the Bitcoin itself to transact?
What you're suggesting basically comes down to, is letting the US government regulate bitcoin and hold access to the private keys to the entire nation's wealth. This is laughably insecure considering the government's past history with digital security and from an economics point of view makes zero sense.

To my understanding, they don’t stay in the mempool indefinitely. I️ believe unconfirmed transactions are dropped after ~~72 hours~~.
Edit: Seems I was somewhat wrong. Unconfirmed transactions are dropped at the miner's digression. Generally when the set mempool size limit is reached. Because there are many miners though with different size mempools, you cannot be certain that your transaction has been dropped.
