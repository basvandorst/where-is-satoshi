Full personal financial responsibility! Don't let those banks nickel and dime you! Be your own bank! And no takes-backsies!
Loving the after-taste of exercising your liberty?
Sorry for your loss!
The price of freedom is diligence!
It isn't theft, it's a stupid tax!
Maybe you can hire a private police force to track down the thief?

I always ask myself who would still buy at this point. I guess there's at least one!

If you are hoping for a future blockchain to have more utility than bitcoin, why buy bitcoin?
Nevermind the fact that Bitcoin itself can be, and has been, forked, which dilutes the value and causes additional confusion and upsets the market

No, they are not. You cannot eliminate counter-party risk, even with a smart contract. Counter party risk is the risk that I lend you money, and you don't repay me. "But the smart contract will ensure repayment, you say." 
Ok, so then either the smart-contract itself has to have sufficient money to repay the loan, or the smart contract has to be authorized to initiate a payment from your wallet to mine. 
In the former case (smart-wallet contains the money for the loan), you cannot access the money from the smart contract, because otherwise my guarantee of being repaid is lost. (You could spend the money which the smart contract transferred to you, and then at a later date not have sufficient funds to repay the smart contract).
In the latter case in which your wallet must be guaranteed to have sufficient funds in it to repay me, you would have no need for a loan (since you already have the funds!).
Conclusion: I cannot be guaranteed repayment of my loan to you, unless the smart-contract doesn't allow you access to the money, OR you place an equivalent sum of money in escrow (in which case you don't need a loan!). 
Smart contracts solve nothing

Talk about a sunken cost fallacy right there. Bitcoin has not proven itself, it's been a series of "moving goalposts" as all of its original goals have been demonstrated to be fantasies. Now everyone is sitting around wailing and waiting from some mysterious "institutional investors" to come and buy the bags they're holding. But they're not going to, because then they would be left clutching the bags, and they're not as stupid as some wide-eyed coiners living in fantasty land hoping to be one of the very few who strike it rich by selling at the right time

Of course you can raise the bar as high as you want to, and claim that people don't "truly know" about Bitcoin until they've read the white paper and made the pilgrimage, but who cares? If they've heard of it and have a curious nature they will have done "their own research" and come to a conclusion. 
Unless you want to go door to door extolling the church of Bitcoin you're not going to get any more market penetration. Ask an average person on the street what Bitcoin is and they'll tell you something like "internet money that goes up and down and is used to buy drugs". And the best thing is this: they're not wrong.
Peak hype has been reached along with peak price. Adoption has not occurred. This whole world of Bitcoin and blockchain boils down to securities speculation dressed up as technological innovation.

Why is it harder? Because the world economy is finite. The same reason that investing 1 million is relatively simple, but investing 10 billion is much more difficult 
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:44:04
You may have been right in your assessment of prices going ever higher, if there were 100 billion people in the world, 95 billion of whom had not heard of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's public exposure has peaked. The world knows about it. It had its moment to shine, and there aren't any people who would be interested in buying Bitcoin who haven't already done so.
It's a failure as a currency and as a store of value, The only thing it has going for it is as an object of speculation and for black market activities (though even here it fails vs. USD cash in terms of anonymity)

I cashed out what I had left in early Dec 2017 and told my friends to do the same, it was obvious the bubble was going to come down very quickly after the huge rise all through 2017 and bitcoin publicity spanning the globe...  
Unfortunately I lost the password to my main offline wallet where my mining proceeds were going. So much for future tech, right? Well I learned my lesson and after selling my mining equipment in a boom market I came out square. 
Mind you I was just mining ethereum, because I thought the idea of a decentralized general computing platform was neat. However time has shown that it's not really practically useful for anything. Now I'm over in buttcoin eating popcorn.

Yet more transactions -&gt; higher transaction costs and longer transaction times. That's the opposite of a traditional network effect.

\[citation needed\]. 
Even if they were abandoning their own currency, bitcoin would make a far worse choice than simply buying USD, EUR, Gold, or whatever. Bitcoin is not a currency, and it's not digital gold either. It's simply an object of speculation
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:13:49
Lol, trotting out that old horse? They would be far better off with cash USD or a digital equivalent (no bitcoin is not a digital equivalent)
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:18:34
Not sure if this is satire or not.
What a cumbersome setup! If this is the best Bitcoin can do after 10 years you'll never make it!
"Bank the unbanked"? Other people are doing finance with an SMS and Bitcoin requires this kind of hardware? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:36:26
Bitcoin mining is centralized in every meaningful way. The hardware used is largely the same (a couple of different models of antminer), there are a handful of companies who control the mining (Bitmain etc.), and the mining pools (also controlled by Chinese groups). 
Buying and exchanging coins is also highly centralized through opaque exchanges which engage in all sorts of fraudulent activity. 
The idea of 1 Vote = 1 person = 1 CPU is admirable but as we can see: unworkable. The forces of centralization dominate all crypto, far more than the traditional banking system.
Now to complete your comparison in good faith you have to mention that the traditional banking system does far more than simply keep balances and enable transactions!

Unless there is some secure and non-wasteful mechanism of ensuring that anonymous participants can be restricted to running a single node which may vote only once (no proof of work, no proof of stake), I don't know how Bitcoin or blockchains can ever resist the gravitational pull of centralization. 
If you get rid of the requirement of  anonymous participants then a a distributed could be fast enough for certain classes of simple financial transactions (it would still be only as fast as an average node, though with increasing computing power this may be enough). The storage issue would also be surmountable.
Bitcoin diehards might take issue with not being anonymous - but they shouldn't - deposits or withdrawals already tie you down unless you go for your Local Bitcoins Dealer (which are totally legit and totally not money laundering)

There are plenty of failed states in this world without effective government. Why not go and see how they're doing? In the best of situations, the biggest warlord on the block effectively takes over and him and his posse form the new "government". Power vacuums get filled. In worse situations, there's basically a civil war situation with power struggles with horrendous loss of civilian life.
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:43:20


You're absolutely right. That's because Bitcoin isn't a corporation with assets or dividends, and therefore it's purely an object of speculation: there's no reason to buy it unless you think other people will buy it off your for more money in the future. 


Hodlers sit at the intersection of greed, stupidity, and complacency.

Adoption is clearly imminent

Are you high?

No, Bitcoin is the legacy tech here. Just because it's a newer application doesn't mean it's automatically better. In terms of features, BTC is in the banking equivalent of the dark ages.

This is why we have regulations and consumer protection laws... 
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:40:50
And we will tell them that we used 3rd parties because of the added services they provided, such as protection against accidentally transferring your funds to the wrong person, buyer and seller protection, protection against theft and fraud, and a whole lot of convenience, such as instant transfers (imagine waiting for 30 mins for a Bitcoin transfer to be incorporated into more than one block!) and neglibible transfer feers. 
We will tell them that coupling funds merely to a piece of data such as a private key is a hare-brained idea, and that many people lost a whole lot of money on silly mistakes and that, all things considered, a few dollars a year in banking fees were well worth the peace of mind.

hodl is a meme for suckers. If the price is going down you sell and rebuy (if you want to stay in bitcoin at all)
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:59:32
Ok, so let's take your two examples which allegedly show an example of an ideal society, and place them against all others where no government is brings about failed states and results in massive death and misery for the population. 
Bitcoin exists to take money from suckers and give it to "early investors". If you didn't sell Bitcoin last year during the massive bubble, you're the former.
