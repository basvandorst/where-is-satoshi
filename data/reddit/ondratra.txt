Just closed my account :P Since I found my VPS provider accepts BTC couple of months ago there is no need - and I will pay for any online services BTC exclusively from now on.

In Czech Republic we got company bitstock.cz which works on credit-of-letter basis -&gt; you are completely safe while trading. But it is not usefull for bot-trading as BTC side of trade is done fully on blockchain and seller(of BTC) has 24 hours to transfer his coins.

I am not sure what do you mean. I used Paypal on cca 3 occasions and then started to pay my VPS regulary each month(my current provider is LunarVPS.com) - every month I had problem with ACK of payment(but that was problem of provider as they revised each paypal payment manually). After couple of months I realized they accept BTC(not sure if they accepted it when I registered or it was new feature). So as crypto enthusiast I immediately start paying by BTC(which is automatized on my provider's side) so all problems are gone :P

on the other hand they could be facing "their own" jail time in the end - after default

I understand regulation as tool of government to bend something to the way state wants it. With posibilities of Blockchain-currencies recently "materialized", both state and it's tools began to obsolete. There is no need to special "regulation" because we create the protocol/the network with our own rules - why would we bend our own rules? :D

I might be overreacting over "Smarter search", etc. - I don't have a solid proof about backdoor in Ubuntu(and of course has no time to study whole code of distribution), but the fact that it sends anything to 3rd party is disturbing to me and made me stop recommend Ubuntu to people.
I hope reasons for Windows and iOS are obvious.

PLEASE READ THIS if you rly care about security. Smartphones have backdoor in their modem firmware -&gt; so there can be no real spy-proof end-to-end encryption. Read more here 
It's surely more secure than regular e-mail because usuall 3rd party can't decrypt it, but with backdoor in smartpone you never know who has access to it.
I hope I don't have to mention that from similar principal you can't ultimately secure your messages from Windows, iOS and some Linux distribution(aka Ubuntu).

Please see my other comment. They probably won't ban it because if they will want they will just force your operator to use their backdoor in smartphone modem !proprietary! software to get what they want.

Thank you, Sir ;)

Can you explain how it will make it much harder to taint? (Or any link on relevant documentation appreciated)

MIT + video with 360p -&gt; really?
