How do you deal with the volatility?
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:08:55
It may be well known, but it exists only within bc and as the blockchain gets bigger exponentially won't this kind of short cut be more and more tempting, won't orphan blocks become more and more numerous?
But I get that it all could have been avoided at this point and Mt Gox is to blame for not doing the proper checking.

But it takes a human to write software that fails so spectacularly (and makes people rich in the process.)
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:50:57
interesting. there are some people holding lots of bc in my neighborhood!
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:51:09
Hey, your right, it is a inflatable dingy! I guess the "saving the world from government" aspect  of bc had me assuming it was a lifeboat.
2^160 !! I'll believe it when I see it. (bitcoin is neat, but scaleable to currency level? still not buying it.)

This! 
Do not see why the OP is complaining, assuming he is the same person that posted the question on SEmeta. The vast majority of the many many questions he has posted on SE have been answered.  
 "You're getting downvoted because you haven't shown any effort in solving this problem yourself." shows up in the questions that were not answered and rejected by SE users. Using "cash" to try to fix bad questions is not going to improve the SE experience.

Yes, it took carelessness or laziness on the part of Mt Gox, but the mechanism of the failure was purely bitcoin based. There was a reason they were not doing proper checking, and that reason has to do with the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 18:54:11
So y'all better **wake up!**
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:18:21
Thanks. Useful info and a grounded response. This is all very interesting. Yes I am skeptical, mostly over scalability issues. It is good to get real info and not rose-colored glasses hype.

ding! ~ Amazon:[83million users a month!]
Bitcoin:10k to 2mil owners. 31 million transactions in its entire lifetime [as of this article](
Would imagine that and the volatility make it not worth the effort to implement and manage.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:19:28
Have asked about this many times. 
How could bit coin work anywhere near the scale of a ~~real~~ fiat currency when the blockchain is already proving unwieldy with less that 38million **total** transaction in its entire history? That is less than half what Amazon does in a month. 
To that one gets only two responses: 
1) It will get fixed at some point in the future, once bitcoin is widely adopted. (Everything wrong with bc is fixed by more people using it, btw.) or 
2) Silence.
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:49:43
edit: still have to take cash from vast majority of buyers and covert to bc somehow. so how are you going to get all that cash into bitcoin without bank involved? are there brick&amp;mortar exchanges available? no really, I am serious...
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:18:37
Everybody cannot be in the 1%, because it would be the 100% at that point! 
@_date: 2014-08-24 18:53:38
Aren't the miners approximate to middle men? They take a percentage and can't use bitcoin without them.

Yes, he is trying to win back the lost coin by playing blackjack.

How can it actually do that when it only exists via the internet which is provided by those same entities bitcoin allegedly undermines? Just because *they* have chosen to let bitcoin exist on *their* networks doesn't mean *they* will continue to do so when it becomes a real threat.
This has already been shown to be the case with other internet applications where tyrannical governments have and continue to: block content they do not approve of ( China w/ great firewall), stopped internet services they do not approve of ( Tunisia, Egypt w/ Twitter), turn the internet services against the revolutionaries ( USA, Canada? busting twitter protest organizers).

As a retailer using bc how do you handle the volatility?

It ain't called the *Wall Street* Journal for nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:55:22
I thought the failure at Mt Gox was sparked by not checking transactions against the blockchain properly which would have a lot to do with bitcoin. Then the holding of bitcoin in limbo while waiting for transactions to clear was used to string victims along which is also an accepted part of using bc. And when it finally all went away, with those hundreds of thousands of bc in an untouchable wallet(s), thus unrecoverable, also bc centric.

Scalability? energy consumption? downgrades by big money bankers previously hot and heavy when "most of us got in well above 10k"? (edit) oh yeah, the regular occurrence of the gutting of exchanges by hackers/insiders?
think positive ... think positive ...   did you know, Scientologists (think they) can move things with the power of their positive thinking?

Who understands bitcoin? The people behind the Sheep, that's who.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:02:21


was going to make a snarky comment on how much things improve when the lawyers and bankers get involved but seriously wasn't bitcoin invented to get away from those types?
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:49:42
It is truly a fascinating thing, the concept and the maths behind it are amazing. But as a full fledged currency I do not see it holding up. 
The blockchain will collapse under its own weight as the number of transactions grows a few orders of magnitude, never mind the 6 orders of magnitude increase required to match major currencies. Look at the charts for the lifetime of BC. The expensive ones (Blockchain size, hash difficulty, transaction cost) are showing exponential growth. 
I have yet to see a solution to this that does not require some sort of centralization.

5 to 20 minutes average transaction time (source blockchain.info) is near instant?

not sure where to ask this so I will try here:
the blockchain, the very heart of BTC, seems like a fatal flaw. Already transactions are taking hours to be hashed and the blockchain file is &gt;10GB.
the daily world wide economy in US$ is at least six (6) orders of magnitude greater than the largest daily average of BTC transactions. (roughly 2.5 trillion/day vs 2.6 million)
All I have read about BTC says that scalability will be addressed in the future, ie there is no solution for it at this point. 
So how can BTC survive at anywhere near the global economic scale?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:42:04
so does that mean no? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:58:44
How do those transactions get recorded into the blockchain and confirmed without internet connection?
