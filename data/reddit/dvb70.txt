So in other words 64% of US investors not ready to buy Bitcoin?

That's the one.

I would love to ask the person who wrote that to explain their understanding of Bitcoin.
This is a classic case of realising the media are full of shit when it comes to them speaking about a subject you are knowledgeable on.  I forget the name of it but there is a term for this where people think the media are full of shit when they see how little they understand a subject they have personal knowledge of but then trust them when they are talking about a subject they don't have personal knowledge about.

The problem with this is successes are more visible than failures.
You succeed and are here to tell people about it.  How many did similar things and failed?  They won't be quite so keen to tell their story.
It's like old story of the guy who arrives in a country with nothing and becomes a massive success in some way over the course of their life.  They are very noticeable.  The 1000 other guys who arrived at the same time and ended up just being normal folk are just back ground noise.

The point was the timing of their release of information.  You can do an awful lot with the right timing of an information release.
You could claim you were completely impartial because you release leaks about everyone but if you release leaks about someone that happen to coincide with a time at which such a leak would be at it's most damaging you are no longer really being impartial.
I am not sure I go along with the idea Wikileaks is completely compromised but I do think their DNC leak showed they are far from impartial.

I am not American and thought Hillary was a terrible candidate.
The wikileaks timing stinks and was clearly politically motivated.  It's tarnished their reputation outside of the partisan stuff you guys are all embroiled in.

It certainly is but it's also incredibly important a candidate has some.  It does not matter what polices someone has if they don't have the charisma to get elected.  In that regard despite anything else HC stood for they were a bad candidate.

Honestly its not at about polices for me but my personal impression of them.  I just felt like I was watching a performance not an actual person.  That's entirely unscientific of course but it does seem for a lot of people they were also uncharismatic.  
They were a terrible candidate because they just did not have the natural ability to get people to like them.  That sounds fairly superficial in the face of actual polices they might have stood for but it's very important that first of all you have a candidate who can actually win.
Not being American their actual polices were not something that impacted me.  Their strongest position was not being the other guy.
