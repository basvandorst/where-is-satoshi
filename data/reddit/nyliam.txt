thaaaaaats not how the stock market works my friend, every single assets worth is exactly 0 if everyone only wants to sell and no one wants to buy, not just BTC
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:34:09
how is 9000 to 13000, then 13000 to 11000 in like 3 days not bull/bear market. or 10000-15000-10000? Or only 500% increase is a bull market? 


what do you mean? In 2013 november bitcoin was like 1100, the same as in 2017 spring. it moved between 400-250 for more than 2 years. What bitcoin history are you talking about exactly?
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:56:20
For 2019 I think it will jump between 9000-13000. For 2020 I think 10000-15000. Why? I have absolutely no idea. Over like a decade I'm almost perfectly sure that bitcoin will gain value. For 1 or even 2 years there is no person on the planet that could accurately tell you the price of bitcoin.
For most buyers who just want to buy bitcoin for short term, its a gamble.

a number can not go zero even if you multiply it by 1/2 to the power of infinity

My post was not against iran, it was a reply to the post that I replied to. I am not familiar with the political situation in Iran, but I think the fact that there is a way to fund terrorism(iran or not) undetected using bitcoin is not positive.

your whole post is delusional as fuck, and basically not a single word is true

It was easy to work with and good for decoration, money use, since it’s chemical properties are ideally suited.  For example, it doesn’t rust or tarnish. 
Next to all of these properties it was visually beautiful, and rare.

People will inevitably lose bitcoin, and since its finite, maybe there will be a point where there is just not enough satoshis remain to be a viable global currency? Dont know.
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:30:43
you are joking right?
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:11:06
choose faster my friend
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:49:21
Thank god it can be used by terrorist states to fund their terrorism undetected and undisturbed. Sure is a good sign for the worldwide adoption of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:45:52
This is all good and clever, but bitcoin will not have any "store of value" value until its price can jump 50% in a day at any moment, and nothing guarantees that it wont drop 80% and stays like that for 3 years. How is it a good storing of value option?
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:09:06
Dude read the post I first replied to. All I've said is that being happy that terrorism can be funded with bitcoin is not right.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:39:50
dont know, probably nothing. There can be unavoidable negative things even with a positive overall outcome. It does not mean we have to celebrate those negative things.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:03:43
what does this question have to do with the topic? I just said I dont consider iran a terrorist state, since im not familiar with the situation. My post:


was about the method, to fund terrorism regardless of it is iran or not.

u better get ready for 4000 boi

"Idgaf I just want to make money lmao"
probably everyone.
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:21:20
Holy shit thats like 1000 bitcoins. How can people give 50 bitcoins like that? I wish that I could get 1 bitcoin in 24 hours. Well not like I could spend 5 bitcoins that fast but whatever..

Your whole point is just not true dude.
Gold is objectively valuable. As an irreplacable component in high tech digital items, and as jewelery.
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:11:04


so its not a  **$25,000** watch is it?
@_date: 2018-11-07 21:09:55
What do you mean by removed it from use? Thats the fucking point, it has use, its used and irreplacible. Thats what gives it value.  Its like saying an apple is not edible if you dont eat it.
@_date: 2018-11-08 05:34:02
Holy shit, your statements are so devoid of logic, it hurts


Yes there is, its chemical and physical properties are its value. You cant remove them.


yes it is, if there was a way to bring it here for less than the amount it worth, ppl would bring it here.


But there is no gold that is not usable. If you have gold you can use it.
I dont even know where you got this "removed from any use" and "if you cant use it", both of these statements are like unicorns, hypothetical, currently in this day and age, gold has value as currency because of its properties and industrial use, bitcoin has value as currency because its being a currency and ppl agree that it has value, you can not use it for anything else other than currency. Its replacable, (like 1 million alt coins) and you can recreate the system in your computer, call it bitcoin 2 and its the same. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:09:37
I will stop answering, when someone starts to insult in every sentence, its a sure sign they knew they are bullshitting. Your statements lack any kind of logic, your main point is "if we remove value", lmao, so have a nice day, I wont reply to you any more.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:31:45
1 bitcoin &gt; 1 gold ?
