I am pretty sure the government is made up of mortals.  I don't have any idea, or interest in who killed Kennedy, but it's fairly obvious it wasn't Oswald.
Yes, it is very possible Mark and company lost / stole the coins.  However it's also very possible that a government could have done it.  A government we know previously confiscated Gox funds, that we know has ongoing investigations concerning Gox, and that we know employed people who stole bitcoins from another operation and moved them though Gox.  It isn't a question of did the US government take money from Gox, it's did they take more money from Gox than we already know about.  I don't think it's a crazy stretch at all to think that's likely.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:33:40
I think it's reasonable to assume that at least a few percent of bitcoins are forever lost.  You also have to account for gold reserves that might be replaced by bitcoin.  I don't think M2 includes any of that.

You have to report your coinbase trades anyway, so unless you never sell coins it's the same amount of work.  I used this site last year:   You just import the raw data from your trading accounts, coinbase is one file to input regardless if (or how much) I use my shift card.

When / if bitcoin is all money what will we measure it's value against?, the dollar?  In this scenario bitcoin is the standard.  Meaning your pay and the prices if everything would be denominated in bitcoin. Well I don't personally see it going that far, I think if it gets anywhere near that it will probably be more stable than almost any national currency.
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:50:52
It doesn't.  (Source: I was a Newegg merchant when they added bitcoin payments.)  They take in all the money then wire transfer the total to the merchant, every two weeks (not 100% sure on the timing).

I can't believe how often I see this absurd argument.  My business accepts, holds and spends bitcoin without issue.
No amount of bitcoin holdings would put any business under.  The only way this could happen is if you were generating less non bitcoin revenue that it takes to keep your business operating and your "large amount" of bitcoins fall to a value so low they can't cover the difference.  How likely do you think that is?
I think it makes a lot of sense for someone who believes in the long term viability of bitcoin to hold the coins they take in.  A small business like mine or say a coffee shop is at best going to take in a few percent of it's profits in revenue.  In most cases dramatically less than we are paying out it credit card or paypal fees.  
I doubt there are many (non-bitocoin) business out there making a large enough percentage of their sales in bitcoin that loosing 100% of that revenue would ruin them or even phase them.  Little to loose a whole lot of potential long term gain.

Stability with growth makes logical sense, and is in fact what we see looking backward at the price movements.  Spreading bitcoin across a larger and larger user base over time might not guarantee more stability, but it's a hell of a lot more probable than causing it be come less stable.  We can't predict the movement of bitcoins price at any given point with any accuracy, but we can look at the trend and think logically about what conditions are causing that trend.  There is a basis for expecting stability with growth.  If there is a reason to think otherwise I have yet to see anyone point it out.

I don't think BTC-E is being shady at all.  If they don't feel they have to do AML/KYC then good for them.  Personally I would rather not give copies of my id and utility bills to every damn place I do business with.  I gave them to Gox and a fat lot of good that did me.  For all I know 'western governments' are the ones who took the Gox coins, at the very least they took a good deal of the fiat contributing to their insolvency, it's only the extent of it that is arguable.
Shrem operated his business in the United States.  Yes I know the US doesn't care about borders and will impose US law anywhere, but does that mean we should expect everyone anywhere else in the world to go out of their way to follow US law?
Targeting BTC-E is dumb.  ANYONE who you trust with your coins, money or anything of value could very well steal or loose it.  If you don't know who they are you probably shouldn't trust them very much.  However, I think it's pretty crappy to assume just because whoever runs this site doesn't want to be a public figure means they are more likely to run with your money, or loose it.

This is why I am holding Dogecoin, Peercoin and Vertcoin.
Not to say that this will undo bitcoin.  I actually think we will quickly recover even if someone does attack the network.  There is a flaw here though, and I don't see it getting fixed unless something bad happens.
Myriad coin also has an interesting solution in using multiple algorithms each with their own difficulty.  I would love to see bitcoin have a second algorithm that allowed people to mine with standard hardware again perhaps borrowing vertcoins method and have that algorithm get say for example 25% of the blocks making a 51% asic attack much harder.

No, he was given some coins that were worth a small fraction of that and they grew in value rapidly afterward.  I think that's a fairly important distinction.  
I once paid a friend 10btc to clean my very small apartment.  Just because bitcoin is worth $400 today doesn't mean I paid him $4000 to clean my apartment.

Well, all of them participated.  I somehow doubt they had a lot of choice in the mater.  Though it would have been nice to see more resistance.  
I have (or had) in total somewhere around 30 Android devices, phone and tablet, from a wide variety of both cheap and highend manufacturers and I have no idea what BSOD like thing you are talking about.  A few of the really cheap pda devices have are a bit pokey at times.  A couple of the phones I have used a long time and loaded check full of every random thing I was slightly interested in from the app store eventually started to have problems with crashing apps or being unresponsive, but that was fixed with a simple restore.  Collectively less issues than I had trying to use Windows 7 long enough to play though the latest Deus Ex.  I have only been involved in making one app, and it works exactly the same on every device I have ever tried to put it on.  Though I have noticed a few newer apps don't seem to work on my old Galaxy S.
Admittedly I have never used a Windows Phone, but I have spent some time on iOS and spend more time using Android than doing pretty much anything else in life (except possibly sleeping).  My only real disapointment was when they decided to make Hangouts the default SMS client and it made my replies to texts go to old numbers I had saved for people rather than the number they sent the text from.  Thanks to the wide variety of SMS apps in their store it was an easy thing to replace.

Well, I don't think the vast majority has to agree.  Just a hand full of big players who are smart enough not to invest in a proprietary system.  Bitcoin is the Linux of the payment world.  It will succeed and grow for the same reasons.  Bitcoin however also has a huge advantage in being first to offer some very significant technical advantages that are not going to be easily replicated by a company trying to compete with it and retain control of their currency.
Imagine if Linux was the accepted standard and M$ or Apple came along and said hey rather than using that freely available universally supported system where you get access to the code and can tailor it to suit your needs you should buy this closed system we just made that only works the way we think it should and only runs software designed the way we want and comes with an absurd EULA, oh and to top it off you have to pay for it.

I don't think it's fair to say it will never be there.  I am always concerned that I will misplace a wallet or screw up the password.

For me the ability to not have to trust others with you money, and perhaps just as importantly being able to make a backup your money that can be retrieved should your wallet be lost or stolen really of sets this issue even as is.  If I misplace a $100 bill it's gone.  If I loose my device with a wallet on it, no problem, just grab the backup from home.

Clearly a single individual cannot exist entirely outside of the government structure while remaining within it's sphere of influence.  My statement was not meant as something that plausibly take place, rather it was a expression my feelings about it's effectiveness.
Why is it that every time someone takes a pro government position the grand justification for government is roads.  I am perfectly happy to pool my resources with others for the sake of building and maintaining infrastructure that we all use.  In fact I wish a lot more of my money could go to that cause rather than being squandered on bombs, drug war, and corporate bailouts.  I would also happily give more than my fair share to support space exploration and probably many of the other projects our government contributes to.  
I think we can not only sustain ourselves without the political overhead, I think we can advance more easily without dragging the political elite kicking and screaming into the future.  My argument is not that all things coming from the government are bad, but that it is taking more from us than we are getting back out of it.  Our national governments are obsolete operation systems, incapable of keeping up with the world they are trying to govern.  This is now a peer to peer world, it's time for an upgrade.

Well it has been forked and people have followed.  
Litecoin made asics less overwhelming, just not enough. 
Peercoin added proof of stake in addition to mining so you get rewarded for holding and has a fair following.
Vertcoin is strongly anti-asic and is gaining some support.  People with more $ can still buy more hardware, but they will not be able to push out small miners.

Well as I understand it the existing bitcoin ATMs generally connect to an exchange somewhere and are not just selling coins owned by some local person who put up an ATM.
Not sure what the legal difference is, if any, but it seems to me like there might be one.

My bet is on forever.  Even in our ideal future where bitcoin is ubiquitous and everyone uses it people will still not understand it.  Most people seem to have basically no idea how money, the internet or their credit cards actually work and those are things I think most of them could grasp if they wanted to.

I am not saying that they were legally required to disclose their method.  Nor am I asking them to ditch due process.  I am simply saying if they want to have any credibility publicly they should have explained at the time how this was done.
This is a very public case with repercussions beyond the trial it's self.  In the current climate I do think it's pretty reasonable for the public to scrutinize how this kind of information is being collected.  Regardless of how legally proper this might be, it's still shady as fuck.

Look at the order book.  
Edit:  If your looking for how to see what is in the order book: 
Green line is made out of buy orders, Red line is made out of sell orders.
If you zoom out and look at the $1000 mark you can see that buying the next 14K bitcoins listed for sale on bitstamp would push the price up to $1000.  Obviously new sell orders will appear quickly if you tried to do that, but 14K is only about .1% of the mined bitcoins, and it would cost less than $10M to push the price that high.  Pushing the price down would not require much more coin that than.  
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:49:46
I don't think a foundation really adds value to bitcoin, however one already exist and if there must be one I would just as soon see more than one voice.
No, pools having the power would be a very bad idea.  I don't suppose there is any way to cut though and let the miners themselves vote without having it a feature of the mining software.  Still seems possible.

A bank account is not comparable to a bitcoin address.
I can't assume they did this legitimacy just because a judge agreed to let them have a warrant.  How do I know the judge even understood what they were going to do?
I know what Silk Road was/is and am not bothered by it.  The drug war is a stain on the reputation of our government.  I will not hold back my opinion on that out of fear for bitcoins reputation, it will have to survive worse.
Bitcoin does not fit within the relevant legal definitions.  You could argue they are doing as the lawmakers would have intended.  I would argue there can not be intentions about something prior to its existing.  
Obviously they will convict him guilty or not and none of us are likely to ever know for sure if it was him or if he was made a scapegoat.  The FEDs got the coins so they get to call it a win, even though they didn't really reduce the drug trade or accomplish anything other than press for bitcoin and to ruin a few people's lives to make themselves look like they did something.  
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:29:06
Well I fit pretty will into the "techno-libertarianism = good" category, but I don't see why anyone should consider bitcoin solely in the interests of people like me.  Most of the people who will end up using bitcoin will never understand or probably even really know about that ideology.

Well I don't have Netflix so I don't know what they accept, but Paypal is commonly used for automatic monthly payments by merchants.  
As for it being "really bitcoin" yes and no.  Say Coinbase allowed people to setup regularly scheduled payments the way PayPal does.  If the transaction is from one Coinbase account to another then it's not using bitcoin the network, but it is still bitcoin ownership changing hands the same as $ change hands between PayPal accounts.  If your Coinbase account was setup to auto pay out to a bitcoin address each month then I would say it is using bitcoin in both senses.  
To many people, myself included one of the greatest things about bitcoin is that you can be your own banker and don't need to use a PayPal/Credit Card like service.  The reality is that for most people services such as those are going to be handling the coins they use for day to day business.  Considering the average persons ability to use a computer and handle money I would say that is probably not a bad thing.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:23:01
The fact that it is regular practice does not make it legal.

Bitcoin can be made anonymous.  That really solves this whole problem.  There some features in the altcoins that I think make them potentially better candidates to be the global standard in crypto currency, but I don't think anything short of a catastrophic technical issue with bitcoin will lead to another coin getting there first.
Ultimately compliance issues will not stop bitcoin.  It is just as possible to comply with BTC as it is with paper USD.  Some people will do it, some will not.  Some will get arrested, bitcoin will go on.

I don't see why it would have to.  There is no credit card companies getting a cut.  They will probably start out that way, but higher volume and competition could drive it to be quite a bit lower over time.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:14:25
Both points are fair.
I actually thing Ghash.io made a pretty reasonable statement.  We can't rely on pools to do the right thing, we need to fix it so they do what we need them to do in a decentralized manner.  Badgering them is going to do about as much good as complaining to banks and governments about how banking is done now.
I am confident that there will be a solution, but demonizing Ghash.io or anyone else isn't it.

"effectively making any compensation next to impossible"
A bit less simple maybe, hardly in the same universe as impossible.
So they can't just put the site back up and let us log in then withdraw.  Just lock withdrawals fiat to previously used bank accounts and let people sign up to get a new login if they want to transfer that way.  For anyone who they don't have banking information on file for (or only wants btc) they can just have you sign up to get a pin number in the mail (they have our physical addresses), that along with a new login delivered by email should do the trick.  Also some of us have an yubi key, not sure if those would still be safe to use for use or not, it's been a few years since I read about how they work.
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:36:45
It's easier than eBay.  It takes me a couple minutes to create and backup a bitcoin wallet, but when I go into my eBay or Paypal account and try to find a transactions it's a fucking needle in a haystack that rearranges its self after every time you visit.
The live cd / paper wallet is an ideal solution.  
For somebody that put $10 in bitcoin just tell them to download the client and put in a decent password and click the backup option in the menu to save to a flash drive.  If you can't do that you have no business being on a computer anyway.  
If you invested thousands of dollars ask someone who knows how to use a computer to sit down and walk you though it.

There are only a few facilities in the world that can make high end chips.  Ordering enough of them to be made to out perform all existing ASICs as well as all other ASICs that will come online before yours do would not be a simple thing.  If you were able to do this you would also have to keep them from being easily identified on the network otherwise your multi billion dollar attack will just get ddosed every time it starts getting too many blocks.
Edit: if they choose to buy them from BFL they mite as well just flush the money down the toilet.

The bitcoin market is way too small to have any real impact on Amazons profit.  If they did it now and then released sales figures I think we would look very weak compared to their overall volume.

You have not suggested a course of action.
I could spend 10x what I lost going after him and he would still likely have far greater things to worry about in life than anything I could do to him without serious risk to myself.
I understand what you are saying and generally I agree.  I am the kind of person who will spend a day in court to fight a $20 traffic ticket even if I can't beat it, or fight with Verizon and the credit bureaus for months rather than pay an over charged bill.
If someone on Ebay rips you off you complain to Ebay and most likely get your money back.  Not really the same kind of situation.
The reality is that I don't have any way to contact this person.  I don't know where he is.  I have no reasonable way to bring legal action against him that I know of.  I am not interested in trying to harm someone out of vengeance.  If you have an idea about how I could handle this better I would love to hear it.
On top of that he is probably already either the target of investigations by government agencies from the US, Japan and god only knows who else, or he's working with them, maybe both.  The only think I know for sure is everyone involved is much bigger than me and couldn't give two shits about my personal bitcoins.
Again, if I am missing some kind of opportunity to take some kind of action please enlighten me.

To me humor and light hardheartedness is an appreciable benefit.  Something our world needs at least as much as bitcoin.
I think hearing about bitcoin over and over again will do more good than harm.  It may annoy some, but most will not take it seriously until they hear about it so often it becomes commonplace and when it is people will use it because of the utility and will not care how some fanboys acted back in 2014.
People will buy and use bitcoins for the same reason everyone buys and uses everything.  Someone told them to, over and over and over.  I would prefer it happen as the result of intellectual curiosity and the desire to collectively improve the world around us, but it's simple repetition that will take it to the masses who will never really understand what it is, how it works, or why they are using it.

I like the idea of a simple digital wallet better.  Something like an Yubikey that generates a new change address after each transaction for the merchant.

That was the plan.  I was a bit turned off when tried to search for Google Play and found it very difficult to type on them for a search.   A quick search on my PC reveled that I may have to update firmware just to get the play store installed, and I can't even find how to get the bitpay app without the play store.
On the bitpay site they have a mobile checkout it says works on Apple/Andorid but it just opens up a browser and makes you do it on a webpage.  While that does work on the Archos it does not work well.

That may be some of it but they are using their collective control of the market against a legitimate competitor.  IMO this the same kind of anti competitive behavior that has resulted in antitrust cases for other big companies.  The regulatory questions are just an excuse for big business to act however they please without any regard for their customers.  I am not saying this is an active effort to squash bitcoin, I think that's pretty unlikely.  I would not be the least bit surprised if the people at banks closing accounts actually thought bitcoin was illigal/ponzi/gambling.
The really great thing about bitcoin is that ultimately this will not mean anything.  Bitcoin technology will provides and economic advantage that will motivate the rapid development of workarounds long before any legal action could come to fruition.
edit: For clarification part of what I am meaning to express is that I don't feel the banks lack of understanding of bitcoin justifies their actions against bitcoin users/business.  If they want to close accounts they should take the time to learn about what it is they are doing and if they close accounts of bitcoin users without having legitimate cause that should not be acceptable behavior.  The rational that because something isn't understood and might cause a problem should not be tolerated as a justification for hostile actions.

Despite the vibe here on reddit, I tend to agree with you that Gox is just doing a terrible job and will eventually fix the problem.  Though it is possible that they have sold off a lot of coins to cover expenses related to the seizures, legal expenses, or who knows maybe they did some other stupid things we don't know about.  It would be failure of epic proportions if they really somehow don't have the funds.
My fun theory is that Gox is faking the troubles and the price drop so they can buy up a shit ton of cheap coins and playing us all for fools.

Why, Newegg.  Because I have done a ridiculous amount of shopping on Newegg, regularly talked about and recommended the site to others.  Also because it's an obvious fit for bitcoin, and I was buying GPU's to mine from them at the time.
It's not really specific at all if you consider that I also predicted that most other retailers that I or the people I was speaking to would someday accept bitcoin.  In fact I think it would have been quite strange for me not to have said this about Newegg.  I also predicted that Amazon, PayPal, eBay, Starbucks and just about ever other big retailer or payment service that I would otherwise talk about.
In fact considering how many other businesses I have said this about it's almost surprising that I didn't just by chance mention any of the other big ones we have acquired as potential adopters. 
I'm really not claiming anything extraordinary here at all.  In fact I imagine there are quite a few other people here who said the same thing if they were into bitcoin at the time.
As far as confidence in Newegg, I actually had a bit too much.  I expected them to be the first big player in their market, and Tiger Direct beat them by a quite some time.  I would have never thought use Overstock, Expedia, Intuit, Dell, or Dish in my examples of what bitcoin would be used for someday.  Why, because those aren't companies I had ever done business with before.  I imagine everyone using bitcoin today is imagining the day when they can spend it at whatever their favorite retailer is, why would I think any differently?
If you think about it a bit, assuming I believe bitcoin will be a success and I clearly do, it's pretty much a given that Newegg and most other retailers would eventually take it.  So the prediction is really just that bitcoin will succeed, and that's really the parallel I was trying to draw with my original comment anyway.
and again, the idea that it was something to use for drugs or a toy for geeks were very typical reactions, so again nothing surprising.

I think inevitable is a slight overstatement, but it does seem to be getting more and more likely.  Preventing this is probably not something most of us have any real ability to do, we can only hedge with some altcoins and see what happens.  The real test for bitcoin I think will be how quickly and effectively bitcoin adapts to fix the problem after it has happened.  I could see it being a repeat of last years hard fork.  If action is taken quickly to fix the problem as it's happening it might actually make bitcoin and it's community look strong despite the fact that it should have been prevented.
This at least we can all see coming.  The more concerning thing to me is what has no one thought of yet?

I have used bitcoin to pay people and it's been basically free for me to do.  For people I pay locally the advantage for them is that they don't have to buy bitcoin, they just get paid in it.  I have one person on another continent though who cashes them out for local currency and it's a whole lot cheaper/faster to send him bitcoin than any other option.
My business brings in some bitcoin so I have never had to buy any to pay people, but if you don't have any on hand or want to hold any you could use a service like coinbase where you can purchase them as you need them.

Well, no it's not a ponzi scheme.  A ponzi scheme takes money from it's investors to pay off earlier investors.  That is't happening here.  The system is designed to put upward pressure on the price, but it is a market price.  It can go down, and when it does the system does not collapse.  There is no end point where the last people in are left holding the bag.  If bitcoin gains wider acceptance its value will rise, if it looses ground it's value may fall, but even if Satoshi cashes out his coins and kills the price bitcoin will move on, because while the bitcoin price is not unimportant it does not change anything about how bitcoin works.
Bitcoin is no more a ponzi scheme than gold, stocks, coffee or anything else that has a market price.

Bitcoins market cap is not that big.
Overstock.com Revenue in 2013: $1,304,217,000
Source: 
USD M1 $2,311,000,000,000
Source: 
Bitcoin Market Cap $7,595,978,301
Source: 
Last Years Overstock Sales as a percentage of USD M1 = .06%
Overstock Bitcoin Sales as a percentage of Bitcoin Market Cap = .16% 
(x12 since we only have one months sales data)
Looks pretty damn good to me.  
You also should consider that a large portion of BTC market cap is probably lost coins and that of the portion that is not much of it is in long term cold storage while with USD the money sitting in banks for the long term is made up for many times over by the fact that banks loan out much more money than they actually have.  Many USD purchases represent the spending of money that has not yet been earned.
Also note that Overstock sales numbers probably include sales from outside the US and make the USD percentage larger than it should be.
edit: Overstock is also not likely to be the biggest in terms of bitocoin sales.  It's pretty likely Tiger Direct is quite a bit larger.

Yes, and at the same time transactions happening off the blockchain (inside exchanges, tipping) are not getting counted at all.
It's really apples and oranges comparing bitcoin transactions to PayPal.  The best we can do in that respect is compare it to BitPay or Coinbase.  Bitcoin it's self is cash and should be compared to fiat cash that also cannot be accurately accounted for.  That obviously makes Bitcoin appear much smaller, but it is.  Still very early for this technology.

I feel fine being 90% bitcoin .  Nosweat if it hits $100 I'll just have to make more $ so I can buy again.  I feel like Bitcoin failing would be an enormous loss to me even if it didn't take any of my personal wealth with it. 
 I suspect most people freaking out either invested more than they were really comfortable with and have just not been around for enough bubble/dip cycles.  Do the extreme ups and downs enough it looses its meaning and you start to realize that nothing in your life really changes when you become worth 100x as much or 80% less.  Unless I suppose you really need that money to get by, but if that's the case you should really not have more than 10% in crypto.

Allegedly committed acts considered crimes in the United States by the United States government.
There is absolutely no reason to take a bitcoin as evidence.  Moving the coins to a new wallet under your control in no way proves a crime only that you were able to take them.  If they wanted to prove that they found that wallet they could simply copy the existing wallet as evidence.  
Personally I think sending coins from another persons address without their permission should be considered identity theft, regardless of your justification.

I am not asking them to do anything, nor would I expect them to if I did ask.  I just happen to think they are full of crap.  I do however think it's reasonable for the public to question the legality of the methods used.
If they know that a service like tor is compromised I think they are responsible for informing the public for the safety of everyone using it regardless of how it effects the case, and if they did in fact compromise it themselves they deserve to loose the case and all credibility.
"What repercussions?"
There is a lot of material on this.  Look up Ulbricht's mothers video.
"The public has a right to know the investigative techniques available to law enforcement?"
Yes, we do know what techniques are legal.  What we don't know is if the ones they used were.
"Here's the thing... that's not wrong, shady, or illegal. It's to me, ingenious."
I don't know what to say, except that I completely disagree.
Breaking into someones computer system to open a security hole is both wrong and illegal.
"Do we as a society care how you are then brought to justice?"
Yes, I should hope so.  Otherwise we have a system that can just assume people guilty and have a justification to set them up in order to get "justice".  That is literally the opposite of how it is supposed to work.

The price is important, we need a high value to allow large trades without moving the price too much.  Rising price also incentives investment.  However I don't think the falling price is an indicator of weak demand, it only seems week compared to the huge supply being generated by the recent successes in merchant acceptance.
Unless we are actually loosing bitcoin users (I don't think anyone can make a case for that), the user base we have will eventually run out of coins they are willing to spend.  This could take a while.  A lot of us have been waiting a long time to be able to spend bitcoin on anything and everything we want to buy and now we basically can.  There are undoubtedly some people out there sitting on small fortunes from the last bubble or two and when most people acquire a lot of money they tend to spend it.
I do think bitcoin is succeeding, but it's time to focus on consumer adoption.  We have made our case to merchants and they are getting it.  Bitcoin needs to be easier for normal people to acquire and use.  We need to get ATMs everywhere, and instruct people in how to use wallet apps.

Given holding your own wallet is likely the safest option assuming you do it well.

Anyone holding bitcoin benefits from their growth anyway.  Approach business and present them with the options.  The fact that bitcoin is an open system that anyone can enter and compete in is a major feature.  There is not VISA/Mastercard controlling the network, ultimately business can process their own transactions if they really want to.

The outrage here is that it's a pathetic bargain.  HSBC committed it's crime on a far greater scale (in all likelihood still is), however they get essentially a slap on the wrist while regular people have their lives destroyed for much less offensive behavior.
If I ran a restaurant that knowingly sold contaminated food that ended up killing people who ate there because I saved $1000 on it and got a $100 fine as a penalty while the kid across the street who selling fresh squeezed lemon-aid gets hauled away because he didn't have a licence from the state to operate that business.

I could just sit on my coins and not bother to spend them, pay people with them, or sell products for them.  I am not convinced that my personal efforts to spur adoption will have any notable effect on the price.
The reason I am pushing bitcoin locally is because I want people and business near me to realize it's potential and I would like to transact in bitcoin locally.  If it was only about the money I could just exchange coins for dollars and not care if no stores in my town took bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:35:50
I don't see being compliant as a real possibility.  Assuming someone can write an altcoin that is somehow compliant while still being a distributed system without central authority what nations laws will it comply to?  Could such a coin comply with the regulations of all nations, could the coin be changed as regulations change without handing control over to a central bank or regulatory body.
The major advantage bitcoin has is that it cannot be controlled in this way.  I have little doubt that governments, major banks, software companies and probably others will attempt to make a compliant system, but I doubt very much it will be met with the enthusiasm bitcoin is seeing.

It is important.  The first movers have to invest a lot for a very small customer base and unclear regulatory issues.  This however makes it easy to introduce new users to bitcoin.  Once we have more users we will get more competition and better rates since anyone can enter the bitcoin market.
Once we have enough users it will be easy enough to do in person transactions that you won't need to use ATM's at all.

Ok, I'll argue this.
You are making the case that they can call someone a criminal because they broke a law.  What if that law is not it's self legal?  In the United States Constitution it states "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
Now if we look at the constitution, the document that defines the United States government and it's powers, where do we find it's power to force people to report who they do business with?  Where in this document does it grant the power to require licenses to transfer money?  If it does not, the law, the highest law in the United States clearly reserves those powers to "the States" or "the people".
If a government can make laws that contradict other laws and enforce whatever one they feel like what is lawful and what isn't?

Sure if you happened to document who all the addresses you sent coins to or received coins from belong to, otherwise it's just a massive pile of meaningless numbers.  There might be a public record for some of them somewhere, perhaps for major services that still exist and kept track.  How many belong to personal wallets that no longer exist anywhere, or online services that went out of business.
I use bitcoins for my business, and for those coins every transaction says where the income came from or payment went to, and they all have a documented exchange rate.  For random coins that were bought for personal use or just messing around back when they were worth a buck or less who would have bothered to do such a thing? 
Even if you did document every transaction, that isn't proof.  Unless you have a copy of correspondence from the owners of all the addresses that ever sent you coins verifying who they are and what the coins are payment for it could just as well be made up.  If you had all that, they would probably still say it was fake and keep all the coins.  There is no presumption of innocence here, anyone who would claim that is completely full of it.

Well, it's better than what we have now.  At least someone can't come along and "print" trillions of new bitcoins after you spend your life saving up a retirement fund.
You have to remember that the inflation going down and eventually ending supports the value long into the future.  Even if the size of the user base were to remain static coins will be lost over time, essentially adding their value to those that remain.

CDs, Bonds, Moneymarket accounts don't earn what they used to, many even loose value after taking inflation into account.  Stocks are pretty risky too and basically amount to gambling on the popularity of a given companies stock.  Mutual funds are mostly stocks and a bet that the market in general is going to do well.  I don't personally have much confidence in that.  If you buy gold and silver your making the opposite bet, except that you know there will still be value there regardless of what happens.  
If you save your money it gets devalued from inflation. 
The traditional options don't look that good, or even that safe.
My 2bits:
For me it obvious from the moment I started understanding what bitcoin was.  It is exactly the same as the first time I learned about Linux and read the GPL.  That was when I was in high school doing pretend stock market trading for economics class.  I put my money on Linux companies just in time to see them explode.  Naturally the bubble eventually popped and everything settled back down.  The companies involved are much bigger now, and Linux is everywhere.  People don't know they are using it, MS and Apple still dominate the desktop, but servers, routers, cell phones and endless other devices that we make use of all day every day run on Linux.  Buying a bitcoin however is not like buying a part of a bitcoin company, it is buying a share of the actual technology.  What happened to Linux is exactly what is going to happen to bitcoin, and for the same reasons. 
There is no such thing as a sure thing. An altcoin could overtake it.  Some kind of government/corporate attack on an unfathomable scale could attack it, or more likely try to subvert it.  Bitcoin however is adaptable, I can't even imagine anything short of a fatal flaw in the technology causing it to fail.  Unless it's a flaw that is inherently unavoidable and can never be fixed we can always fork the chain from anywhere patch the issue and keep going.  I am confident that will happen if there is a serious issue.  That confidence comes from the market value of bitcoin, people motivated to not loose that value will make sure their fork lives.

The federal government does't hate anyone, or any activity.  It is not a person and has no feelings or emotions.  It is a machine the functions to server our corporate overloards with a good deal of lower level corruption on the side.  There is not a drug war because anyone feels a paticular way about drugs or drug users.  There is a drug war because a lot of people very high up (and at lower levels too) in big business and government are getting rich off of it.

The difference is that it literally isn't the same thing.  Yes it's purpose is to move bitcoin, that doesn't mean because they found it they are automatically entitled to move those coins.  The government isn't supposed to act like a bank robber, but they are.
I would have to know how they actually did the search to comment on how reasonable it was.  The truth here is that we don't know how they found the server or got they key.  Frankly I think they should have to prove it was legitimate if they want anyone to believe it was.
I derive value from from the earths air, knowledge of language, and from the collective content of the internet.  It's not hard to imagine how any of these things could be used in a criminal venture.  Deriving value is simply not enough, it does not fit the legal description of either property or currency.  In fact the IRS has stated it's not currency, and I can't think of any more legally relevant source that has contradicted that.

Because we are paying them a fuck of a lot to do their job.  As much as I would rather not pay them or have them do most of what they do with my money, I think its not unreasonable to ask that they provide some kind of beneficial service for all they have taken.

The inflation rate is arguable, it is not a known variable, depends who you ask.  Your confidence in the market is much greater than mine.  There are logical reasons for bitcoin to appreciate in value over time, in fact there are built in incentives designed to drive and balance that growth.

I would say it's got at least as good of a chance as most other altcoins.  Price wise I am expecting it to go up quite a bit in the next month or so.  But it's effectively the same thing as Litecoin so I think it really has to out do LTC to have any staying power.  The thing DOGE has going for it is that LTC doesn't really have all that much of a network effect, DOGE could more than make up for that with their user enthusiasm, generosity and just generally being absurd enough to get noticed.
I'll admit it's a long shot, but I do more DOGE transactions than any other coin and find it brightens my day.

Since they have bitcoin and most of the alts to work off of I would say that technically speaking they should be very capable of making something better.  They never will because they are unwilling to give up control of what they create, and the most important feature of bitcoin is that it's decentralized.
As far as the fascism argument, I think you can say that many companies are or have been fascist.  Hitler didn't come to power on his own dollar, he had major corporate backing.  This is of course true of many other leaders who would not be so universally labeled as fascist.  While corporations do not always promote authoritarian governments they themselves are generally authoritarian in their internal organization.

This part in nonsense: "the location of the property"  If bitcoins have a location it is the location of every computer containing a copy of the blockchain everywhere on earth.
It is not the bitcoins they have seized.  The bitcoins exist on the blockchain and cannot be stolen.  What they had was his private key.  They have used that private key to sign the coins over to their own key.  They did not simply take his key and put it in their evidence room, then sell it.  They took the seized key and used it to alter the blockchain.  
I also think one could argue that the key consists of characters created by the user and is therefor speech and the user should be able to invoke the 5th.
While we all refer to our bitcoins as though we own them I don't see how they can legally be defined as property.  They are database entries.  It would be more comparable to if you had attended an event and put your name on the guest list and then the FBI came in and said hey we have sized this persons pen and schedule and were going to come cross off his name and put the name of the highest bidder on this list in it's place.  Yes I realize bank accounts are like this too, but in a bank they supposedly represent real money.  
Regardless of your or the governments ability to jam this into existing legal definitions, government stealing money is exactly what this is, plain and simple.

You appear to be right, that it's happening for 3rd party merchants.  It just doesn't make any sense.  As a merchant you have no ability to even see how the customer paid, they just do, you ship the item and Newegg deposits to your account once a month for the total.
I can't see any reason why Newegg would choose not to enable bitcoin for 3rd part merchants.  It may be that they wanted to offer the blanket discount as suggests and just leave it so 3rd party items can't be included.

In the mean time people who took the risk and or responsibility buying, storing, trading and spending bitcoin will have been a part of making it possible.  Also possibly rich.  Someone has to take the risk and work out the kinks.  I don't feel too bad about being one of those people.

Well that deals with half of it.  You have to think about how it's spent by the campaign though too.  Let's say a candidate takes $100k in bitcoin.  They now either have to trade that for USD on an exchange, or have it automatically converted by a company like bitpay, either of those choices are going to create a paper trail straight to your campaign.  
So we all want to see bitcoin be spendable directly for basically everything.  Let's imagine were at the point where that's possible.  A campaign buys TV ads, or flyers, or whatever for the campaign with bitcoin.  Most of these expenses are fairly public by nature.  You are exposing your sending address to each vendor you pay, that information could easily become public.  
TLDR: Can you do it? Yes.  Is it easier to get away with than with cash?  No.

Yes, it can be used anonymously.  
Reporting requirements for political donations require personal information, linking that personal information to your transaction is not how you use bitcoin anonymously.  There are also donation limits.  To put a lot of money fraudulently into a political campaign that has to disclose it's contributors using bitcoin would require you to create a large number of maxed out transactions with fake identifying information.  The more of that you do the more likely it is to get noticed.
TLDR: It's not impossible, it's just stupid.  Cash would be a much better choice, or donating to a PAC since that is still a thing.

Well, this: 
A full 4TB would be a lot today, but is not likely to be an issue in 2023.
Also no cap doesn't mean arbitrarily large blocks.  Miners aren't going to want to process absurdly huge blocks because it creates latency, even if they for some reason don't care about how much drive space it wastes.  Yes, doing all non-cash transactions on the bitcoin blockchain would be an absurd amount of data, but that isn't remotely plausible even in the very long term.  We simply can't grow at 65-85% for very long.  Comparing it to Paypal would be more reasonable.
Without a caped block size we could end up with a chain that takes up substantially more $ worth of storage than it does now in say 5 years depending on how fast bitcoin can grow, and how quickly digital storage technologies advance, but in the long term 10+ years out I don't think there is any realistic chance that blockchain growth could out pace storage space.  We may get several years of rapid growth, but there will be a plateau, and the hard limits for digital storage are exponentially larger than what is possible for bitcoin to generate.  In 1995 I could fill a floppy up with word documents pretty easily.  I would have to download whole libraries to fill the cheap little flash drives I use today.  Transaction data can't expand exponentially the way other data has from text-&gt;images-&gt;video-&gt;hd video-&gt;4k video, it will remain simple and it's exponential growth curve will end when the market is saturated.
As for ISP caps, well they are just disgustingly low.  They want to milk it for all it's worth, but I think mostly they are cable companies that don't want to loose the TV audience to streaming, but that's pretty much a lost cause at this point.  Though I have no issue at all running two full nodes and playing online games while my roommate watches Netflix.  I don't measure my usage, but the effect on my bandwidth is not noticeable.

He ran as an independent in both his House and Senate campaigns, but to be a presidential candidate he does not have that option.  You can't get ballot access in enough states to win unless you get the nomination of a party that has that ballot access.*  The only other parties that have enough states to win are the Republicans and the Libertarians.  There is also the issue of getting into debates.  Third parties are effectively blacked out because they need to reach a threshold (12% if memory serves) of support in the polls.  While I think it is probably an obtainable number for him most of the polls only list the donkeys and elephants so he wouldn't be able to rank in them at all.
*It's not literally impossible to get ballot access as an independent it's just completely unrealistic.

The growth is limited because there is a limited pool of potential people / business to switch over, and the vast majority of them are going to be doing their transactions though third parties, some on side chains, but also the way many transactions are now, where if I send btc to someone else on coinbase by using their email address it doesn't hit the blockchain.  We also have to share the market with numerous altcoins.  I have little doubt that marketshare will end up divided among several coins.  There will also be numerous attempts by banks and states to create digital currencies to compete, and while I don't favor such a thing it's likely at lest a few of them will be use if only in specific nations.
Yes, drive capacity has slowed it's advance in the last couple years, but it's outside the trend and future technologies look rather promising for drive capacity.  I'm not really too worried about the node count even if it was to drop for a while what hd capacity catches up.  We have quite a lot of nodes even as small as we are now, and I have done the math on how viable it would be for me to continue running a node with all full 8mb blocks from this point on, and it's just not a significant cost.  I might turn off my node for a bit if I have something high priority I really need my bandwidth for, but Steam and Netflix are much bigger draws, and will be for quite a while.

Sure I would like to change things so that civil liberties were never violated, and those with authority over others did not abuse their power, since I live on Earth, in a society of humans I think bitcoin is the more effective solution.
I am all for lobbing to support what is good and right in the world.  I don't however think it will change any of the fundamental problems with in our social/political hierarchy.  The powers that be, whatever ones you care to influence are not likely to give in to doing what is good for society as a whole, if that were the case they would not have been driven to obtain power for themselves in the first place.  
The solution is to create peer to peer systems that just work around that hierarchy and erode it's power until it is no longer able to oppress the general population.

What I suggested is bitcoin coming in being instantly redirected to pay invoices to another company accepting bitcoin.  That doesn't involve conversion at all.

Well I am a small retailer, and I am sure credit and payments are somewhat easier for big well established retailers, but I constantly have issues with getting payments to manufacturers or distributors quickly because they will not ship until I do, and while I usually have estimates they don't always let me know the total cost until everything is ready to go.  In some cases I have had to pay significant extra charges for them to take a credit card, in order to not wait for a check or wire to be processed.  I imagine processing speed is at least sometimes an issue for big retailers as well.  Just because a company is big doesn't mean their checks will clear.

Thats fine and all, but it clearly needs to have a much higher capacity than it has now even as a "lower layer".  We need to grow.  Waiting around until LN or whatever else is finished before gaining new users is not reasonable.  Like it or not time is a rather important factor.  Users are not going to understand the technical reasons you didn't add enough capacity for them, and someone else will sell them on another system if we can't offer them bitcoin.

I don't really feel threatened anyhow, this is probably the 4th major crash I have been though and don't have an real fear that bitcoin is going to die or somehow become less worthwhile to me than it has been the last few years.  
I do really enjoy having the opportunity to buy back coins I spend at a much higher price, though I think the real joy comes from being surpised.  I really did not believe I would see these numbers again.  The kick I get out of being a part of somthing so ridiculous and unpredictable seems to outweigh my feelings about personal gains or losses.
p.s.  I also enjoy that bitcoin brought me to reddit where people actually respond to my ramblings with interesting responces and links.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:37:31
Agreed, a 21 Trillion USD value (todays value) for bitcoin is absurd.  
Two things to remember though:
1. I say "todays value" because the only way I could see anywhere near that much value is if bitcoin were to become a global reserver currency and replace the dollar, and in that case the value of the dollar would drop substantially as bitcoin made it's way up so while it's possible that bitcoin could = 21 Trillion USD some day, on that day the question will be what is a USD worth?
2. We can't really use the 21M bitcoin number to calculate bitcoins value.  Even once they are all mined, a very large though admittedly unknown number of those coins are lost forever and don't really count anymore.  For example lets say all the coins are mined and 15% of them are burned/lost/gone forever.  That would mean $1M per bitcoin would only add up to $17.8T USD.
I would call it wildly sucessfull if bitcoin is able to match Paypal in usage.  I think it would be a reasonable calculate the potential value of bitcoin in this senario based on the value of all paypal accounts combined.  Sadly I don't have the information available so I'll take a guess.  Paypal processes about $570M a day so lets say 20% of that is from funded paypal accounts (as opposed to credit cards).  That leaves us with $114M per day, and lets say there is at least ten times that much money actually sitting in paypal accounts on any given day (though I expect it's probably more).  So we have a $2.2 Billion ballance at any given moment.  That's smaller than the current bitcoin "market cap", adjusted for last coins todays market cap is probably a reasonable value for bitcoin based solely on it's value as an online payment tool.
Bitcoin of course is not just an online payment tool though.  A very large portion of coins will probably always be held by traders and long term investors and of course bitcoin has many other potential markets asside from what paypal does.  So I do believe bitcoin still has exponential growth potential, but to expect a bitcoin to be worth $1M in todays USD is a bit crazy.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:54:26
While this is looking more likely to me, I still am suspicious that they actually do have the money to cover withdrawals and are doing this out of pure greed, figuring they can probably grab more coins this way than they will make processing fees running the exchange for the next decade.
Edit:  Lets face it, even after this they will probably still retain a fair share of trade volume (assuming they don't go under), or sell it off to someone else at a substantial profit.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:59:32

@_date: 2016-03-08 03:48:20
Yes, I get it.  There are a lot of transactions that are not terribly important.  That doesn't mean we have enough room for a large wave of adoption.  Frankly at this point it doesn't mater how full the blocks are, there is the potential for more new bitcoin use than would fit in 1 or maybe even 2mb blocks with relatively little notice, and if that happens we could fill up very suddenly and then be stuck in a position where the network is congested and expensive for an extended length of time because we were not ready for it.  Andreas Antonopoulos actually cited that as his biggest concern during one of his lectures.

Assuming there is enough room and the fees don't get prohibitively high.  If 3x as many people want to do transactions as the blocks can hold they we will not get them as users, some other coin will.
I'm fine with the fees being more than they are, what I am concerned about is actual capacity.  I think we should be able to accept a million new users should the opportunity arise to acquire them.  
I don't think it would fill up regardless, people aren't going to make millions of transactions just for the hell of it.  We almost never had full blocks in the past, so I think it's fair to say history does not support your argument.

@_date: 2015-01-09 18:43:18
Yes.  To be fair I don't need them to pay my bills since my business brings in USD income, and sadly I can't pay my phone/internet/morgage/electric with BTC.  Though even if I were to quit my business and go work for someone else full time I would still be pretty comfortable converting 100% to BTC then cashing it out as needed to pay bills as needed.
I have been in bitcoin long enough that I remember it crashing to zero on gox after the $30 bubble.  I had no relutance buying or holding coins then, nor did I after the $260 bubble popped, now in the aftermath of the $1000 bubble I am just as willing to work for BTC and hold BTC as I was then.  In fact the market is a quite a bit less dramatic these days.
If you want USD and you spend USD or if your on a thin budget and the USD value of your paycheck can not fluctuate from week to week then you should probably not do this, or at least not with a very large percentage of your check.
If however you use bitcoin on a daily basis you get used to it.  Since long before bitcoin I have kept any money not ear marked for short term bills/spending in metals / stocks / or other investments.  Today with services like coinbase it's actually faster and easier to change between BTC and USD than it was for me to move money in and out of etrade or kitco.
The one thing I notice is that since most of my non essensial spending is in BTC my spending habbits change with the market.  I am more willing to spend when the price is high, and I tend to get more conservative with my purchases when the price is going down.

Is there a site somewhere that has a list or table of banks and their friendiness to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:07:19
Possibly none.  Depending on when you got paid and when you made your major purchases it's entirely possible you could have come out ahead.  Given it's less likely since the price spent more time going down than up, but it's by no means an assured loss.
As I stated in my post above I tend to spend more BTC when they have gone up in value, and save when they have gone down.
Just for fun I did the math on what would happen if you had taken a $1000 paycheck on the last day of each month and spent/cashed out as you received the next check.
The result is that on average your $1000 would have been worth $959 when you spent it.  Just over a 4% loss.
For anyone interested I used this site to get the historical prices: 
edit: I had meant to point out that the probable time frame for spending your paycheck is likely a lot less than a month so the price changes would likley not be as dramatic were you to do the math on shorter timeframes or spread out your spending a little on each day.
edit2: Corrected my math.
@_date: 2016-03-02 20:07:30
Something catastrophic would have to happen to cause that for more than a brief period.  Whatever caused it could be a critical failure, loss of miners would be a symptom.  I think the most plausible way that could happen is a natural disaster taking down a large portion of the internet / power grids.

Stupid me for paying invoices from my supplier in Germany instantly and without the 10% extra cost a wire transfer would add to my inventory, not to mention the 5-7 day delay.  Stupid me for allowing my employees to take their paychecks in bitcoin.  
Your totally right, why should people be able to do those things.
Sure the value of bitcoin will go up either way, that's why I'm still holding most of my coins.  I wouldn't have bought nearly as many if I didn't think it would appreciate.  That isn't why I started a local bitcoin meetup, why I set up local business to accept it, why I explain it to people and coax them to try it out.  I do those things because I see the potential benefits of this technology and I want to see it used.
Who are you to say what it is meant to be used for?  I see no reason it should not be used in the manner I am using it, or that others shouldn't be able to as well.

It is only going to seem like a good idea to two groups of people.

The other group are people who are taking someone else's word for what it is in the hope that they are right.

I think it's pretty obvious they didn't expect doge to exist long enough to make the cap relevant.  I really don't get the impression anyone was trying to pull one over on us.
I really don't see how this is going to have much effect, it will be years before it's coin volume is growing less than bitcoin, and ultimately they will probably not even keep up with lost coins.  Notice doge price is up today, doges largely don't care.

It's not "impossible" it would just take up a lot of space and bandwidth.  I understand the point being made here, and I am fine with off chain solutions to expand capacity, but we don't have them yet.  There is no viable alternative that exits right now.  Why not make sure bitcoin has the capacity for everyone who wants to start using it before LN or whatever else you want us to use is actually available?
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:44:48
I sorta like that he's anonymous.  I think it add something to what bitcoin is.  It says something about the kind of world we now live in.  It says that you can make a grand contribution not only without being famous, without broad support from your government or business, without even being known.  
How many great works thoughout history were done by anonymous?  When we think of great accomplishments, we think of who made them.  When we think about lightbulbs we think Edison, when we think gravity it's Newton.  History is full of great people we must learn about.  What will people look at when bitcoin is part of history?  It will not be the personal history of it's creator.

"Dash or whatever alt happens to be competitive"
This isn't about Dash.  There are hundreds of alt coins, and if none of them work out well people can keep making more new ones.  Many of them are trivially different from bitcoin, some are arguably better.  There is one reason bitcoin maintains it's dominance, network effect.  Making the coin more private, or giving it a different governance system may appeal to some people, but probably will not unseat bitcoin.  What will is cost.  This is a true free market and it if bitcoin costs $1 to send and the next biggest altcoin costs 1 cent, there is an enormous incentive for people to use the cheaper one.  Bitcoin as a store of value will only be better than that competing coin so long as it has a larger market cap and more stability.  If bitcoin maintains a 100x cost gap it will destroy that edge and cause bitcoin to eventually loose it's advantage.
It's easy to sit there and discount one specific coin you don't favor, but you can't discount them all.  If we allow an economic intensive to use a cheaper bitcoin people will.

Because people are actively looking for ways to take BU nodes down.  I can't prove that no one is trying to take down the core nodes or how good they may or may not be at trying to do such a thing, there's simply other factors and even if there wasn't can't look at these one possibly two attacks as proof of the relative quality of code.  It's not a suitable set of data to base such a claim on.
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:15:34
They don't care about bugs, but it's suspicious that they patched the bug in 24 hours?
Ok, no contradiction there.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:40:42
Most people running BU nodes (or the latest core) are probably watching what is going happening on a daily (even hourly) basis.  I wouldn't expect nodes running older software to come back very quick if knocked off.
I knew about this pretty much immediately, as did everyone on a bitcoin sub or following any other kind of Bitcoin news regularly.  I could have easily turned around and fixed my node right away.  I just happened to be occupied and not actually too concerned about it being down for a day.
Honestly, this was pretty hard to miss.
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:19:48
I felt like the 8mb solution was a very reasonable compromise from the 20mb some people wanted.  Now it's been compromised down to 2mb and core still won't accept it.  So giving up 90% of what we wanted isn't good enough?  Shouldn't a compromise involve both sides moving toward the middle?

I did some googling and it looks like that's just a typical price for an internet connection there.  He would probably be paying the same amount if he wasn't running a node, or if he was running a node with 10mb blocks.  Just as the case would be for me, or most anyone else, unless you happen to have a really low data cap.

They are not well reported for the Libertarians, and every state does it different.  The results that I have seen (MN for sure) Johnson won by a decent margin with McAfee second. 
  
My state is just sending the people who wanted to go to national as delegates.  I don't think McAfee was even running yet when we selected ours.  I think it's likely other states are also sending undecided delegates.
In the Libertarian party the presidential candidate does not choose their running mate, so often those who ran for president then run for vice in the next round of voting.  I think McAfee has a decent shot at vice.

I do see that the Core team is larger and likely more technically capable.  I also see them as absurdly hostile to people who disagree with them.  
Implementing BU's solution doesn't mean we all have to run BU.  I strongly support multiple clients.  I think it's a bad idea for the whole network to run the same software by the same team.  Core doesn't have to go rage quite if BU's solution gets adopted.  In fact if it does and they created a BU compatible client with Segwit I would likely run support that.  
I computers as much as I trust people so if not more, the whole bitcoin system is computer-mediated consensus.
I would love for some qualified dev team to come and propose a solution that gives a hard cap increase and the features of Segwit, and for both current teams to build that solution into their clients.  Sadly it doesn't look like that's going to happen.

Anyway Moore's law has been a year away from dead for years now.  It will eventually be true for the standard 2d on silicon transistors we use today, but it's not the end of computational scaling at all.  I expect a continuing accelerating uptrend over the long term.  The issue with bitcoin mining is more about miners getting up to the limits of the current technology, and we are pretty close, so I do expect we will see others jump into the market as bitcoin grows.

BU and SegWit together are hardly more than 50% of the network.  So based on current numbers assuming all BU and Classic miners leave that would put SegWit at 76%.  Still pretty far off from 95.
It could lead to rapid activation, but it's also very possible more than 5% or remaining miners would refuse to activate, or simply don't care.
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:16:55
It will be whatever it becomes and whatever market it doesn't satisfy will use another coin.  I happen to think there is room for several coins to be very successful.
I personally want to be able to use it for everyday transactions, and will likely move much of my holdings if it becomes non viable for me to spend it to shop Newegg and Steam.  Even if my coins are someday worth a billion dollars I'll probably still manage to spend most of them in those two places, somehow.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:52:07
That's assuming none of that 75% comes out of SegWit share of the hashrate.  Considering SegWit has 25.8% now it seems mathematically impossible that BU could hit 75% without the SegWit share shrinking.  
I was mostly trying to point out the fact that so many miners haven't chosen a side.  Basically all miners need to choose for that to play out as your suggesting.  The 75% that fork with BU obviously have to choose to do so, that leaves 25%.  95% of that 25% is 23.75% of current hashrate, so 98.75% must choose a side.  So if 1.5% don't you can't get to 95.  That is of course lower than the current SegWit percentage, but again, BU getting to 75% requires SegWit to loose some of it's share.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:55:20
Well, bitcoin is pretty broken and they are closer to getting consensus on a fix.  
I don't actually give a crap who's solution gets implemented, but someone's better. 
I wouldn't be too cocky here, your just asking for someone to find a way to take down core nodes.  Not that it would hurt anything any more than this did if someone does.. it's just easy to forget you can fall while laughing at someone else's fall.  
I'm all for some healthy competition between dev teams, but when it comes down to it we should all be on the same side here and it seems like there are way too many people more worried about stroking their ego than what is good for bitcoin as a whole.

Ya, not really a bitcon problem.  It's pretty much the same thing if you want to open a Paypal account.  
Most of this is regulatory or banking issues.  Coinbase has to be compliant to stay in business, and they don't want to get screwed over if you buy $100 in bitcoin then do a chargeback against them.  Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed.
Eventually there will be ATM's and other locations all over where people can quickly and easily swap currencies, but money transfer laws stand in the way and it's going to take some time for the few who want to jump though all the hoops to get all the infrastructure into place.
If it wasn't for money transfer laws I would have put bitcoin ATM all over 3 states by now.
If it's not easy enough for you, wait a few years, and it probably will be.  Your going to miss 10 or 100x price increases, but that's the cost of convenience.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:23:01
So your merchant is running a BU node, and therefor knows what BU is (or at least his payment processor does), and opted to install it.  I feel like pretty much everyone actively using BU nodes at the time of the fork should be aware that there are two competing chains, if in fact there are.
Isn't the AD=12 12 blocks ahead of the block size you have set, not just 12 blocks after some random transaction you received?
It seems like for this to happen a lot of things need to fall into place:
1. The receiver needs to be running BU.
2. The fork needs to result in a split with both chains surviving.
3. The sender must sent payment while the chains are still compatible.  (Before the 2MB chain gets longer) and get it to not be included in the a block in the 2MB chain.  What prevents 2MB miners from including it?  The will have more space to than the 1MB network and likely a lower fee threshold.
4. The sender must get their payment sent and received on the 1MB chain before the 2MB chain gets longer.  This seems like it would be very unlikely without majority hashrate.
5. The receiver would need to have their node set to the recommended EB=1MB and a majority of the BU miners would have to be set to a higher size.  (Something the person running the BU node should probably know)
6.  The sender would have to know the 2MB chain would eventually out pace the 1MB chain or at least have a good probability of it to bother.
edit: 1.1 The sender needs to know the receiver is running a BU node and what it settings are to have any confidence that this will work.  Unless this person is just spamming transactions everywhere hoping to come out ahead.

@_date: 2017-03-07 22:45:33
I do feel like the hashrate is leading here.  I don't think one of these solutions is inherently more valuable and will therefor win hashrate, but I do think having majority hashrate will make whatever option gets it more valuable than the one that doesn't.  
If BU gets to 75% it will retain the majority of the value in the event the core chain is able to continue.  If SegWit activates with majority hash rate BU will not likely ever fork, and if it does with a minority it will have far less value than the core chain.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:47:02
The only thing the other exchanges are doing differently what they call it.  What exactly is the difference between BTU and BTC-u?  
How is an exchange going to get "wiped out" by cross trades.  They make their money on people trading between coins.  For that reason every major exchange will offer both and make them tradeable to each other, it's in their best interest.  
Coinbase being marginally more accepting of BU than other exchanges means nothing.

To be fair two chains can survive, and might given the divide here.  It is however rather unlikely that the chain with majority hashrate will end up worth less.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:57:44
Very few have picked a side, and those who have expressed some preference haven't been terribly definitive.  If you have some sources...
There was someone a while back who asked all the major exchanges what they would do in the event of a split and the feed back was pretty neutral.  I suspect all exchanges will show both coins as they do with Ethereum, assuming we do end up with two chains.
edit:  As for actually running a BU node.  I feel like at this point they should at least be running one for testing purposes, regardless of what they support, but I don't really expect any of them to disclose that with all the hostility this is generating.

This is dumb.  I was more less all a couple years ago.  I'm not making an issue of blocksize so my investment will be worth less.  I do it because I use bitcoin daily and I would like to not only continue to use it daily, but have millions of other people also be able to use it daily.  That isn't possible with 1mb blocks.  Frankly it isn't with 2mb ones either, but at least that would show that we are mindful of growing network capacity before we need it.
I'm sure there are people using this to manipulate the price, people are always trying to manipulate prices, but to say that's the cause of all this is just insane, and frankly insulting.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:06:22
Your assuming no core developers continue to work on bitcoin post fork if BU gets support.  If for some reason every core developer just rage quits we are probably better off without them.  I don't think that's likely though.  I will support whatever gets majority support and I suspect that most others will too.  We all have an economic incentive to do so.  Despite various reservations I have about both sides and the fork in general, bitcoin adoption and it's ascending value is not likely to reverse itself based on the outcome.

That's a valid argument for Bitcoin vs Paypal.  It's a totally worthless argument for someone choosing between Bitcoin and Dash or whatever alt happens to be competitive.

I have been glued to r/bitcoin since 2011, pretty sure I'm not the only one.  Even when I'm rather busy keeping track of what is going on with bitcoin is't something that gets neglected for long.  
Pretend everyone who disagrees with your point of view has malicious intent or is paid to if that makes you feel better about it, but all this shows is that BU node operators are paying attention.  That really shouldn't be surprising, because nobody who isn't would likely be running a BU node.  On top people running BU nodes are doing so to make a statement in support of BU, so it makes sense they would care about the nodes uptime and keep track of it.

That means nothing at all until BU, BCU whatever you want to call it actually exists.  As much as everyone likes to pretend to know exactly how this will turn I don't think anyone has any idea.  
edit: To be clear what I mean is what if something happens to prevent a fork, or at least the BU fork as it would be with the current plan.  People buying BU tokens are not just gambling on what coin would be better, they are gambling on if BU will even be a separate coin.

Why don't they just do it now with SegWit?  I don't understand putting it off.  They simply are not going to win support back from BU without doing that.  As is the SegWit activation isn't viable, and attacking BU is just making BU not viable.  So what we sit on our asses and do nothing?  
Just HF the blocksize with SegWit and at least make some progress.

If both chains are not active how does this happen / matter?  You can't spend coins on two chains if there is only one chain.


Ya, I'm not sure what I was thinking with that one...


Yes, but with similar conditions.  The receiver would have to no realize there is a fork happening, and it's not like these things are likely to be a regular occurrence.


Well assuming they get though the 1MB mempool in time who is this person attacking?  When people order from me I generally end up with their address.  This would only seem to be a valid attack if against someone who is selling something that is as liquid and easily movable as bitcoin, basically an altcoin, or perhaps some kind of bitcoin gambling site could be gamed, but I don't see this working on a retail site or most other kinds of business.  The kinds of business selling quickly and anonymously transferable merchandise that can be easily turned back into cash should probably be careful in this situation, or just always.  I don't however see how this could be done against me in any type of transaction I use bitcoin for.


Because other people could find out and try to attack them?  If and when it forks your welcome to place an order from me and we'll see what happens.


Seriously?  I'm not saying no one would do it, I'm sure many people would just for kicks, but if you can't come up with a reason not to, that sounds like a psychological problem.

Ya, I think it's a misconception that BU supporters are against Segwit in general.  Some are, but most just also want big blocks and are prioritizing that.  I think there's a pretty good chance you would see Segwit or something very similar down the road in BU.
edit: I really wish both sides could agree on some kind of solution that allows block sizes to scale and gives us Segwit.  It's time to end this before we loose any more marketshare to altcoins.
@_date: 2016-03-08 07:00:06
They aren't being priced out, it actually burns coins to do it, that makes price the factor in cost, not blocksize or fees.  I think there are methods that don't but as I understand it they are much more limited.  Even with their method it's a bit tricky to store anything very large (multiple mb).  2mb blocks are not going to change the viability of storing data tiny amounts of data on the blockchain, and I'm skeptical that 4TB would be worth adding at any blocksize.  You need more than a use case, you need a viable and affordable method of putting that much data into blocks.  
Even if it was possible that 2mb blocks immediately became completely filled, and stayed that way forever that doesn't really hurt bitcoin.  The drive space, and bandwidth used by that would be trivial.  I have a horrible internet connection, and I have no issue running a node, and my hard drive would take 43 years to fill up with completely full 2mb blocks at the current rate.  I don't know what hard drive capacities will be like in 43 years, but I think it's a safe bet that a couple of extra TB isn't going to be an issue.  I know a few people here in town that run, nodes for something like 10-12 coins on hardware from the thrift store.  Same guys that developed the blockchain archive software actually.  It's here if your interested:

It will only result in two chains if enough people oppose the compromised solution.  If it can't be made to work it can be abandoned.  Perhaps there isn't a solution that enough people will come to a consensus on, but that's no reason not to try.  
Frankly we don't have a lot of options.  If a compromise is not reached we either have a contentious fork possibly resulting in two chains and a defection of many supporters from the loosing side if they both don't or we stagnate.  
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:39:13
I want warp drives, but we can't all have what we want.  Sometimes we need to work with others to accomplish what is practical under the conditions.  There are a lot of other people invested in bitcoin who don't necessarily share their point of view.  We need to work together to make bitcoin grow.
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:35:30
I think it's silly to assume this isn't going to keep happening.  Even if it was intentional we are at a point where the blocks are full enough intentional filling of them is relatively easy.  There are however other factors.  The price dropping.  I don't know about you guys, but I tend to spend my coins when the price is going up and tend to put off purchases when it's going down, I'm pretty sure merchants and payment processors have made remarks about that phenomenon as well.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:25:33
That statement was in direct response to your claim that BU would only fork at 75% my initial statements did not assume that you did.

I send them almost daily and my fees all appear to be about the same despite current full blocks.

I don't understand why people are so hung up on what it gets called.  Assuming we have a fork that results in two viable chains at least one of them has to be called something else.  
I don't feel like two survivors are terribly likely to begin with but if that is the case whatever coin the markets (traders not exchange owners) decide is worth more is going to get the most public attention regardless of what it's called.
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:11:23
Ya, I kind of expect them to give in an fix that, but who knows.
It had just occurred to me that they may think it's just as well to not have exchanges show both right away.  If BU did split with 3x the hashrate of Core and the option of bigger blocks that would make moving BU coins to exchanges much faster and cheaper Core coins, potentially putting BU at a substantial disadvantage in trading.  Giving the network a chance to experience the loss of hashrate may make them look a lot better than trading will.
Just a thought I completely pulled out off my ass, so there is probably something I missed, but there it is for what it's worth.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:50:43
The plan was to fork at 75%.  It sounds like some of the bigger miners are shooting for 80% to be safer.  So unless someone goes off half cocked I would expect it to be planned. 
Of course anybody could potentially mine a &gt; 1mb block at any time, but I don't expect anybody will follow until hashrate is secured.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:43:27
Either the 75% for BU or the 95% for Segwit being reached prior to a fork would be a pretty solid victory IMO.  I think regardless of what solution ultimately gets implemented a minority fork is not going to be a very long term threat to that victory.
You can argue economic majority, but the reality is most holders, and even users don't give a crap who's solution gets implemented and don't have the technical understanding to make that call anyway.  They will simply follow what the majority of miners do.
I could be wrong, perhaps there are enough ideological big holders on one side to destroy the price for the other regardless, but I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:24:30


How it ends up after the transactions is beside the point.


Did not implement what?  Other settings?  Users knowing about forks?


No, they can't.  A miner could mine an irrelevant quickly orphaned block.  A majority of miners can increase block size.  It's not the kind of thing one random person can do and expect the whole network to just follow.


Most exchanges require a good deal of personal information to setup accounts so scamming them is probably not a great plan.  Also any even slightly competent exchange should even right now be ready for a split, quite a few of them just went though it with Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:20:13
He with the most hashpower will win.
I don't want to jump the gun and call it now, but at some point this fight is over and those on the loosing side will need to give it up.  Segwit (or something similar) is very likely to get support in BU.   Most BU supporters are not against Segwit or LN, they just also want a block cap fix. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:31:27
This is all talk until it happens.  
No doubt many people will sell one coin for the other if we split, but I don't know how anyone can claim what side has more coin behind it.  If I had to bet I would say the side with majority hashrate maintains the highest value.
In any case this seems like a silly threat against someone who undoubtedly has a crapload of bitcoin, and a constant flow of more to sell of in whatever direction he likes.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:54:16

Well, anyone who wants to can take part.  I don't see any other way to actually prove support from holders.
It's definitely not perfect.  Most long term holders are not likely to open cold wallets to vote, and funds in use or on exchanges are not going to be accounted for, but it's substantially more valid than wild speculation.

Who knows how much he paid to make the equipment to mine the BTC he sold for the BCH.  It's probably safe to say he's up a thousand percent or more over what was initially spent in terms of fiat, probably a great deal more than that.

In a free market people who don't act rationally are less successful, anyone can get lucky, but in general irrational behavior is not good business.  It doesn't seem like things work this way in the real world because irrational behavior is often subsidized and rational actions are often suppressed or even criminalize.
Crypto might not be a true 100% free market, but it's a lot closer than almost anything else we deal with in real life.
Of course the long term success of BCC depends on a lot of factors we don't have good information on.  Most major players are not open about what exactly they are doing or intend to do.  We also don't know what the effect of another fork that hasn't happened yet will be.  
That said I do think there is good reason to believe that the prices of the two coins will tend to get closer together over time because BCC starting off as the smaller cheaper coin gave a buying power advantage for it's proponents who had to let go of a relatively small amount of their share of BTC to get a much larger share of BCC.  That's not to say BCC will overtake.  The closer the gap the less the advantage, but if they can close the gap enough to position BCC as a solid competitor and start getting companies to support it before BTC can implement a scaling solution the lower BCC transaction fee could push it over.  I think it has a decent shot.

I assume the equipment to print the hologram stickers isn't super cheap.  There are high resolution images of these coins easily available so you would have to design it to look the same.  
It would take time and money to develop a passable counterfeit, and you can't just spend these things at some unsuspecting store.  You need seek out people who are actually interested in them, and that likely means publicly advertising.  You sell a fake off say ebay and somebody notices it's fake at some point it comes right back to you.

I think it's pretty obvious he doesn't care enough to come out and give his 2 cents.
He would risk being identified, but also because it doesn't mater.  The technology is out and that can't be undone.  Hundreds of coins now exist that can work in any way that is both possible and desired by more than a trivial number of people.  
From an ideological point of view it doesn't matter what coin "wins".  They are all incredibly easy to exchange, and that's only going to get easier with things like atomic swaps.  Very soon everyone will be able to use whatever coin they want to do whatever they want.  A variety of coins is a great thing.  We will have a massive free market of currencies and tokens that people can use however they see fit.  The only reason to be a 'my coin is better than the rest' kind of fan boy is to try and convince others to make investments that support yours.  Take your stake out of the picture and the success of all the cryptos is good.

I would be shocked if Chinese officials were not trading it by now.  Any wealthy party would be foolish to try and fight bitcoin for little to no benefit when there is so much potential profit to be made.  Perhaps I give Chinese officials too much credit, but I think they are manipulating it for profit.
Even from the point of view of the state, they have far more to gain by having 70%+ of bitcoin mining and exchange happening in China than to give that up to some other country.  Capital flight though bitcoin is insignificant and could be easily offset by them simply buying some coins as a hedge.
If they believe bitcoin is long term viable the only smart move is to buy in, if not there is no threat and never will be.

Well, I'm sure that's the point for some people, but there are quite a few other reasons to use bitcoin.  I for one report my bitcoin trades, because I know they will eventually come looking for that information if I don't.  I am however still avoiding the inflation tax and retain all the utility advantages, moving money anywhere for relatively low cost, being able to personally secure and back up my savings without having to trust a third party.
The point of bitcoin is whatever you want it to be.  For me trying to avoid capital gains tax would be lot of risk for relatively little gain.  The big upside in terms of making taxes harder to collect is really the decentralization.  It's easy to seize money from large institutions that hold all of it.  It's much harder to seize money from millions of people holding it themselves.  Bitcoin+Gig Economy+Automation is going to make tax collection (and other theft by the state) a heck of a challenge.

You have to have someone to double spend against and for a really large sum if you want it to be worth your effort and expense.  What could you buy that would be worth while?  Is there some easy way of quickly turning bitcoins into something really valuable that can't be undone?  I would imagine if someone buys a $1M in gold or pipes that much into an exchange the double spend is probably going to be noticed before you can make your get away with it, and it's probably going to be really obvious who did it.

At this point we know for a fact that US authorities took at least a couple million of the Gox money.  Their justification by accusing Gox of not having the proper license is irrelevant, because the money belongs to the depositors who had not knowledge or control over that.  We also know that agents of the US government stole coins.
I don't think it would be at all crazy at this point to think that the USG or it's agents might be holding more of the Gox money in one form or another, and be pressuring Karpeles to keep quite about that or other investigations.
A bit tin foil hat, but how can you not be wearing one at this point in the drama?

Mining more coins just means there is more coins that could be dumped on the market.  Why do you think that would make the price go up?  Does anyone check what coin is more profitable to mine before deciding what to buy?

If it meant a million dollars a day was flowing into bitcoin in order to maintain the attack I think that would probably draw in more people than would be put off by the fee, and $3 is still a lot cheaper than many other forms of payment.
For example I am about to send a bitcoin payment to a company in Europe that without bitcoin I would have to pay $40 + 5% to wire money from my bank to pay.  I would take $3 over that any day, and compared to WU or Moneygram $3 is practically free.
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:00:31
Alright the only use case I have actually used or seen used is to send multiple times to the same address.
Since whoever you give an address to can send to it as many times as they like from as many places as they like could this cause a problem for the person receiving funds?
I recently had an issue with an address I have sent to several times where one of the transactions just never showed up, and u/luke-jr criticized me for reusing, but could not give me a reason whey it would cause my payment to not show up.  Is it plausible that reusing could cause this sort of thing?
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:45:43
There are many people holding coins who have never done a transaction other than to acquire the coins, and many acquired them off chain.  Perhaps "users" is not quite the right description.
Edit: About 75% of people I know who hold or have held bitcoin fall into those category's.

That one building doesn't but the bank overall definitely does.
edit: I think it's also fair to consider the resources required for the bank to operate that are not directly controlled by the bank.  Bitcoin miners once produced and installed require little more than the electricity to run.  Think of all the energy that must be required to keep that building operating on even a day to day basis.  How many people have to be transported to and from it each day? how many deliveries made to it? how much waste is hauled away from it?

Why would they "stop development"?  It clearly wouldn't be practical to sustain this kind of attack indefinitely, frankly I don't think it's practical to do it at all.  That said if people insisted on waisting absurd amounts of money to slow down bitcoin (and make us all stupidly rich) the micro transaction stuff could just be done on one of the altcoins or some kind of side chain.

Sure business or projects using bitcoin for something might reduce their buying, but most of the buying is speculation, and why would speculators stop buying when they know that someone is dumping $650k a day into it, and that if they stop it will go back to normal?  It's also rather questionable how much of the newly mined coins are getting dumped on the market.  You have to remember the market only represents a small portion of all bitcoins.  The market depth is rather shallow.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:05:10
I think the price will rise despite this.  Store of value alone is enough to make bitcoin much much bigger.

Well those are apples and oranges.  Creationism is an explanation of why the universe exists, Darwinism is an explanation for how life evolves within that universe.  Those concepts are also not mutually exclusive.
The simulation hypothesis seems like just as valid an explanation for our existence as any other that I am aware of.  The plausibility issues with the religious creator explanations are in the details/dogma not the overall concept that the universe could have been created.
The two factions here in bitcoin land are both acting out in childish and counterproductive ways.  I maintain that my characterization of them as toxic and the negative effect I see that having on bitcoin in the markets holds true regardless of what solution is better or if they would both be good or both bad.  The one thing they do have in common with your example is that they are not mutually exclusive, and in fact it seems like many supporters of both sides are actually fairly open to what the other wants, but are drowned out by trolls and subdued by a mutual unwillingness of each side to accept that their opposition shares any common ground with them.

Hoping for it and predicting it are two different things.
Notice I didn't say those things, and I think your assuming the worst on the part of those higher in this thread.  
Though I'm not sure hoping for something is actually selfish, regardless.  It's not an action, it doesn't cause anything to happen, at least not the kind of things that have effects on this scale.  I think it's more of a desire to witness history in the making.  
Significant historical events usually involve some nastiness.  The most bothersome thing to me about my own mortality is that I will not get to see how civilization develops past my lifetime.  That doesn't mean I want everyone who is going to die to die, in the same way that when I watch a documentary on Alexander the Great or WWII and enjoy watching it doesn't mean I would want to cause those things to happen.
That said I think your being very pessimistic here.  The fallout could possibly be very bad for a lot of people, but that is by no means assured.  Personally I see bitcoin's accent as our best way to prevent at least some of the nasty side effects from a dollar collapse.

No, your house would be worth nothing if it burned down.  These coins are worth over $200 each, more than likely a vast gain over whatever they were worth when they were acquired by their owner.  We can't know for sure unless whoever controls them tells us what they paid for them, however it's much more likely given how thin the markets are that they were acquired at an earlier time and moved some if it around in even 500 coin chunks.

What downtrend?  Sure the price is down, but that's because it went up stupidly fast, it had to fall back.  In every other measurable way bitcoin is growing.
Bitcoin is a technology not a clothing style.

Clearly supplying internet access directly to homes via physical cable isn't something that a large number of business are going to be able to do in most places.
Lines can be shared, a variety of wireless technologies exist.  In a lot of places my fairly ho hum phone data exceeds the speed of hard wired connections.  Despite the barrier to building a national tower network there are many providers to choose from, such as the one I use (Ting), that provides basically the same service I used to get from Verizon for $120 a month, but now I only pay $38 and don't have to deal with Verizon.  In even moderately dense populations like a where I used to live in a ring of 12 apartment buildings it would be very reasonable to offer access via short range wireless.  In fact had I owned one of those buildings I would have seriously considered doing that, because of how shitty the cable and DSL options were there.

You can already donate cash, and it's far easier to track than that.  Either way it's on the party collecting it to document and report where the money is coming from.  If you donate on a website your required to fill out a form with the necessary information.

Sure in theory people could keep running the old client and send non 101 blocks after 75% of the network and all of the exchanges have switched.  Anyone accepting that transaction as valid would be an idiot since it would be worth little or nothing since the vast majority of the network would not consider it valid.
No one sane is going to stay on the short chain, and it's very clear the the exchanges and payment processors want this.

" All great civilizations had a mainstream religion/tradition and God or Gods."
So did all the really crappy ones.
What  libertarian is I think depends on what libertarian you are talking to.  The primary issue I have with people who want a socialist society is that they want to force me to be a part of it.  If people want to get together and create a commune and work as a community for their common good, I can understand the appeal of that, might even want to be a part of it.  I just don't want to see it happen on a national level where you end up with an elite class of people deciding what is best for everyone else, or more realistically deciding what is best for them in the name of benefit to society.  Also I think most libertarians could be accurately described as fiscally conservative.

First of all Steam is really bias since most of the products on Steam are Windows only.  Though that is changing, I use Steam on Linux daily.  That said 1% marketshare is more than enough for very good Linux support.  Basically everything most people would ever need works on Linux.  I can't remember the last time I ran accross hardware that didn't work with it.  1% Bitcoin addoption would be nothing short of spectacular.  I think 1% is underplaying it quite a bit though, even if we take the Steam number at face value at least a few percent of those users don't even use their computers, and many more use them very minimally, often in favor of using their Linux based mobile devices, and while those devices are not litterally desktops they serve basically the same purpose for many and are just as relevant to Linux marketshare if not more so than desktops.
If you think bitcoin is "magic beans" why are you even on this sub?  
1% of global financial transactions "barely worth talking about".  What?  Seriously.  I almost stopped reading your post at this point.
The "year of the Linux desktop" quote as is more a failure to see mobile as the future platfrom than it is a failure of Linux to gain adoption.  You can belittle it all you want but an Android device is just a small PC.
"Linux wasn't going to break through into mass user adoption because people didn't actually want it, or that there were reasons that people might not actually want it and that these needed to be fixed."
This is nonsense.  Linux didn't break though because it isn't sold by retailers.  Most people using PCs don't know what Windows or Linux actually is and couldn't tell the difference much less have a reason for not wanting it.  They just buy what is on the shelf at Best Buy or Wallmart.  The reason it's not on the shelf is not because people don't want it, or any kind of an issue with how Linux works, it's mainly due to M$ abusing their monopoly.
"Nothing much has actually changed to make people want Bitcoin "  
Really?  Nothing has changed?  What did we have for purchasing options a year ago?  I wouldn't call it mainstreem but it's a lot more appealing to people than a year ago.  I used to get a dismissive reaction anytime I mentioned bitcoin, now people are interested.  I wouldn't call it mainstream, but it's a lot closer.  
"What products or services could actually use Bitcoin in an underlying, invisible manner that couldn't be more easily/efficiently done without Bitcoin being involved at all? I struggle to think of any."
You sir have a very limited imagination.  Remittance obviously, but basically any kind of online or long distance transaction could use bitcoin to function without the end user seeing it.  It makes a lot more sense for the general population to use accounts/cards/services priced in their local currency and held by another entity (paypal, bank...).  Just look at what's already happening.

I don't know why this keeps being said.  Linux desktop is here.  I have been using a Linux desktop basically everything, every day (minus a few camping trips) since mid 2008.  I know many others that do as well.  Just because every dumbass who buys a PC at Best Buy doesn't use it doesn't mean it failed.  If bitcoin were to get the kind of addoption Linux has I don't know how it could be seen as anything other than wildly successful.
More importantly "desktop" is far from the end all of adoption.  While Linux desktops are relatively sparse, it dominates in other areas.  Servers, phones, tablets, and all sorts of other devices.  I think you would be hard pressed to find someone in the modern world who doesn't use Linux either directly or indirectly in some way on a regular basis, they just don't know it.  The same thing applies to bitcoin.  Will the general population all wake up someday realize the potential of bitcoin, download it and sync up the blockchain.  No.  They will have probably not even know they are using it, or that they products and services they use are using it to function.

I didn't say anything about throwing them out or destroying them.
You could always hedge your bets and send them as a transaction on each chain so you have both, nothing wrong with that.  
Old wallets would still be valid on both chains, and for the ones your spending all that matters is that people accept them as valid.  
If you have some coins and send them in a BIP101 transaction that transaction would not be considered valid by anyone using the current core client so would you not still have those coins from the perspective of anyone on that chain?

Availability:  Never even heard of Samsung pay, but both that and Apple pay are severely limited unless they become available on all devices.  So right out of the gate I put them behind the other three.
How you use it:  I'll give a slight edge to Samsung/Apple/Google on this one, but it's not widely used yet and by the time it is Paypal/Bitcoin will probaby have it too.
Security:  This one is pretty stupid.  They seem to judge each system by what retailers have access to, except bitcoin (where it would clearly win).  Then they call it tricky because your responsible for your own funds, while not mentioning that with the other 4 you must trust someone else to not only hold your funds, and give you access to them on demand, but also that they will not reverse your transactions without your permission.  This also overlooks the fact that you could use a service like Coinbase to make Bitcoin security essensially the same as the others.  I think you have to be really bias to come to any conclusion here other than a solid win for Bitcoin.
Pros: Yes, all fairly easy.
Cons: They are all rarely accepted at this point.  Paypal has a slight lead, I have seen it accepted at major chains and gas pumps.  Never any of the others.

Agreed.  In my experience a disturbingly large percentage of atheists seem to also be socialists.  To me it seems like such an obvious contradiction.  Both organized religion and government consists of a group of wealthy/powerful people at the top who seek to tell us how to live and control how we behave.  They both claim their ideology is correct and the others are wrong.  The only real difference is that the socialists have dropped the pretense that their ideology is of divine origin.

Sure if they are trying to purchase exactly enough bitcoin to buy something.  It seems pretty obvious to me that, and should to anyone doing it, that there is probably a difference in exchange rate at any given time or that the price could fluctuate between when the user buys and spends.  If I was on vacation in Mexico I would never exchange exactly enough USD to cover what I thought dinner was going to cost me.  Similarly I never put exactly the ammont needed to pay a bill in my checking account before writing a check.  As a general rule for any kind of transaction bitcoin or otherwise you should always have a little bit of room for error.  
In any case this is a really ineffective way to use bitcoin, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Take a nice round number $20 or $100 or something, put it in a wallet and then try it out.  If your wasting the time to reload your wallet for every transaction your just wasting time.
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:14:21
Honestly that's all we need.  I can and do use Linux for almost everything*.  If bitcoin achives 1% of total transaction volume that's enough to make it accessable and usable basicaly everywhere for those who choose to, as well as give me a completely absurd return on investment.   What more could we ask for?  We don't need to convert the whole world to do things the way we think is best, we just need to develop the technology to the point where it's available for those who would prefer to use it.  
*Really, between my phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop I probably spend more time using Linux than I spend doing anything else in life.  I might possibly use my house more, but use Linux a lot outside of the house too so it's close.  If I didn't do most of my work from home Linux would easily have it.

It was good for bitcoin.  It forced exchanges to be more secure.  I got sent a free yubi key for my gox account and it made people think a bit more about who's got their coins.  
The last Gox lag crash was even better because it lead to the diversification of exchanges, we now have four major exchanges, having an exchange available and in working order is pretty important if you want to do business in bitcoin.  Now it's a lot harder for one company to drop the ball.

I really did not get a lot of explanation with this statement, and I asked if he was sure, because it sounded funny to me.  I also asked if that was legitimate and he said it was.  He did say there were exceptions depending on what I bought.
Naturally no one will ever be able to prove how many of my small transactions are purchases/donations/tips/whatever, even if I tried to figure it out, same as cash in my pocket.  But assuming you are buying something of high value, how would you establish 'fair market value'?  
  But the big problem either way is how do I know what I paid for my coins, and how would anyone else?  I trade on Mt. Gox and submit the trade history to my tax guy and pay my capitol gains on it, because if anyone asks I want to be able to show I have been legit from the start.  However I also have coins I bought for cash, traded with people, mined, bought on some exchange that doesn't exist anymore at some quantity or value I could only guess at.  When BTC was around the $200 I found a few thousand $ worth sitting in an account I didn't even know had a balance.  I can't even tell you what has happened to them since much less what I originally bought them for.
I guess the bottom line is if you turn a large value of BTC in to $ in any way, you should probably report it on your tax return and have some way to explain how you got them.  I just have a feeling a lot of people who have never paid capitol gains in their lives before are going to get burned after cashing out bitcoin.

Much less than 800 in them.  My phone wallet is down to 0.3 btc, now, in fact I think they are all under 15 atm, but I have people pay me for things in bitcoin and I do some mining.  The big wallet has remained mostly untouched due to price rise.  My phone wallet for example was originally loaded with about $50 in btc, I have since spent hundreds of dollars with off of it and not run out yet.  I simply don't need the amount of value in my savings wallet, and am happy spending coins in my small wallets while its value grows.

Well I think you would have to trust the house to run the game fairly (like most casino games).  Modding it to be provably fair is probably not realistic.  It could be live streamed with live betting, but since the game is so long it needs to be played out in many parts I don't really see how we could insure that the house isn't cheating.

Sure demand is the other factor, so why not blame demand?
Perhaps to some people personal freedom is important.  Some of us see it as a basic right to be able to make decisions for ones self, to decided what we want to consume, what we want to put into our own bodies to become a part of who we are.
A more practical answer might be that demand is not the solvable factor.  Demand is part of human nature, it cannot be solved by denial on the part of authority figures.  I would argue demand is not at all possible to remove from the equation while on the other hand the vast majority of drug related violence is directly related to their prohibition and can be eliminated by simply ending prohibition.

I used bitcoin to pay for the development of software I use for doing inventory.  My site: 
After trying several solutions closer to my location (and failing to get a usable product) I hired someone off one of the earlier jobs for bitcoin sites who put together the software I use now.
Since my software was created as many small projects and addons that I paid for individually and the developer lives on another continent it would have been very expensive and time consuming (not feasible)to pay him with anything other than bitcoin.

Thanks, though I think speculation has a lot more to do with market movement than actual fear in this case.  Myself and many others sold coins thinking we would be able to buy back as it slid down.

Well, the only way I see it as safer to pick a US exchange is that you might have an easier time going after the company if they take your funds, than from some company on the other side of the planet.

I have received my BFL Single, and it is running at the speed advertised, a friend of mine just got 2 and they seem to run a bit under their stated rating.  These units do use more power than stated.  I have not tested mine to see how much, I saw someone post that theirs used over 300 with computer hardware on the same PSU. 
So I will adjust my estimate 350W X $0.06 per KWH = $0.50 per 24hrs.
 Using this calculator.
It tells me that at a difficulty of 103 (probable average between this one and the next one) that I will loose $13 this month.  I should be able to make up $13 easily even at an absurd difficulty.
Given I live in ND and have rather cheap power, I also have my unit directly in front of my AC, but am running it less than I did last week without the miner so I'm not counting that since most of the coins I will mine are likely to be between now and next summer.
I have chosen to be on a rather small pool  that has only found 2 blocks so far, so my mining has a good deal of luck.  I am giving it about even money we find a block before the next difficulty adjustment.

Well as far as investment is there anything preventing people in the UK from buying via second market or other more traditional investment options that become available?  For use of bitcoin is there anything preventing users from buying on bitstamp or any other exchange not in the UK?  Does any extra tax apply to a UK based company accepting BTC as payment?
This is bad, very bad for anyone wanting to sell BTC in the UK, but it does not prevent penetration of bitcoin it's self into the UK, just keeps exchanges out or limited to under the table transactions.

You have given me an idea though.  While BTC is going up, USD is going down, compare minimum wage buying power of the past to current date, pretty dramatic.
If I was to offer my employees a wage linked to a value other than the USD I think I would pick gold or silver values (payable in USD or BTC).  My business is too small for this to be worth the paperwork at the moment, but I'm guessing my BTC accepting employees would see some value in linking their wage to a more solid resource than either currency.

So hard to get yet look how fast the price rises.  The people putting in the effort to get some while it's still hard are the early investors that make it easy/possible for everyone else to have it later.  
The risk/expense/effort of mining, holding, trading in bitcoin by those of us who are doing it now is creating a value that others will want to get a piece of.  Those people will start accepting bitcoin, selling bitcoin, creating bitcoin infrastructure.  Yes, right now it requires some effort.  If you don't want to put it in just sit back and wait, some day bitcoin will be easy, the same way Linux was hard when I used it in collage, and today my dad uses it without issue.  The only difference is that bitcoin is offering a rather large reward to those who help bring it to that point.

Say I have (or a group of people have) $1M and would like to manipulate the bitcoin price, or say I just feel like buying $1M in BTC for whatever reason, I could move the market 10 may 20 percent.   Now take a look at bitcoinity.org/markets and imagine a couple extra zeros on the price of each bitcoin on the order book.  Now $1M doesn't move the market that much.  
It is likely that as bitcoin grows the amounts moved in and out of it will grow too, but it is limiting.  There are only so many people out there with $1M they to put into bitcoin.  It wasn't long ago that if I wanted to I could put a $1K into Gox and watch the chart move when I did it.  If I buy $1K worth the BTC today I might not even be able to see the live move.  
Someday assuming the price rises it will require millions of dollars more going either in or out of bitcoin to move the price noticeably.

The cart would have been a great idea even before bitcoin, but having an online currency really makes it possible to do this kind of thing more smoothly.  You should develop a feature bitcoin accepting websites can use to show up in your cart as already accepting bitcoin, but still allow the customer to checkout multiple stores at the same time, just forward the coins to the already accepting sites (without the fee if possible :)

If it had just shut down and we lost it's volume perhaps the price would have been hurt a bit more, but what we have now is wide spread publicity not only for bitcoin but for the scale of business that this poorly protected black market was able to develop while only accepting bitcoin.

I accept bitcoin though Bitpay on my website (using Opencart) and list on Coingig as well as Bitmit.

The percentage by dollars processed would probably be the majority by a wider margin.  I'm sure bitcoinstore keeps theirs, so when I buy hardware from them and those I pay use bitcoin, so each coin spent on my store will likely go though at least two more non exchange transactions.  I don't think stores changing to USD is a bad thing at all though.  With our price movements I really can't see it being any other way.  At some point 99% of bitpay will probably be stores cashing out, since none of the big companies are likely to hold BTC.  It will help liquidity and support the exchange business.  At some point they will probably sell it directly to investment funds, or use all that volume to support services that allow bigger companies to use bitcoin for large international transactions without moving the markets all over.
@_date: 2013-08-14 17:53:18
That's great!
I am just saying that I expect customers will have a choice of using sites the trust or escrow services.
Any feature that grows bitcoin by adding customers and merchants is good for you even if you don't use those services.  Because it is decentralized and ultimately no one is required to use the third-party services.  
It is not a bad thing for there to be third parties involved in exchange, what is bad is when they are mandatory.  When they know we need to use them (MC/VISA/Paypal) they can overcharge, sell our personal data and provide poor service, because they know we can't accept payment without them.
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:13:28
My site for example (miwestcord.com) keeps it all in BTC, then we used the BTC to buy supplies (computer hardware from bitcoinstore.com) and to pay employees (both my part timers get paid in BTC).
I don't know how many other sites keep the BTC, but I would guess a fair number of them do.

Seriously?  Steal their customer base.  Mine is the biggest store on Coingig, and I can tell you they sure aren't getting rich off 5% of my sales.  I don't know what their total sales are, but I wager a guess that 5% of their total sales is not very much profit.
I think we should support them.  If other companies see a growing marketplace perhaps they will be more interested in entering the bitcoin market.
ebay takes 2-3x as much and practically forces you to use Paypal
Amazon takes closer to 25% by the time all is said and done (a lot more for some items) and they hold your money for 2 weeks, and sometimes freeze all your funds for 90days or more at will.  
I can't see how anyone who is an active seller on eBay or Amazon could consider Coingig a rip off.  Newegg Marketplace charges 20% and in addition to a far worse interface, and payment lag, I don't even get as many sales there as on Coingig.
Also Bitdazzle and Atomic Mall are now accepting bitcoin.

Similar, but not the same.  Bitcoin is getting much more widely distributed than shares of anything.  The large chunks are probably held by a rather small number of people, but it's very early in this venture and it already has a diverse global base of 'early investors'.

Personally I see it being well into the 4 digits, 5 or 6 is a bit far to say, but it's got a shot.  If I'm wrong, so what?  If it's a bubble?  If it bubbles 5 times?  Not really any crazier than when I thought 2 years ago it would be 3 digits.  Is optimism bad?

I'm pretty sure the bitcoin economy is what was meant.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:42:38
This argument doesn't make any sense.  If you have the option of storing your money in a currency gaining 800% or one loosing 4% (more likely 7-10) and you are confident this trend will continue, why would you choose to loose value?
Suppose all your money is bitcoin.  Would you stop buying food?  For how long?
If I keep my money in bitcoin, and no not all of my money is in bitcoin, that is what I will have to spend.  I don't keep USD$ laying around, if I need to spend from savings it requires me to sell bitcoin, silver or some other asset I feel worthy of investing in.  Now when I cant trade my bitcoins for what I need right now why would I go though the bother of converting them to dollars then spending them?
I can go on, however the simple truth is people do spend bitcoins.  I pay two of my employees with bitcoin, I buy many business and personal items with them.  It is faster, less chance of issues with banks, credit companies, paypal.... and it's often cheaper.  People like myself spent bitcoins at $1, $10, $30 and will still be spending them at $1000.  If we weren't it wouldn't be worth anything. 
We saw a speculative bitcoin bubble, then we saw it pop.  It's still here because people use it.

I think the easiest way is to just add bitpay and coinbase services to an existing POS that displays the barcode the same as many websites, customer scans it w/ smart phone sends coin, something shows on the register when it's visible on the network.  Many if not most POS's are bascialy standard PC's with some POS software installed should be easy to add.
I am considering making one myself.  I run an inventory service and hear a lot about how terrible and expensive POS systems are that my customers use.

@_date: 2013-05-18 04:01:42
1. You setup an account with them, it has a bitcoin address.
2. Customer pays to that address, with bitcoins = to price of item/service.
3. Bitpay deposits $ into your bank account = to price of item/service minus a 0.99% fee.
Super easy.

Ya, would be interested to see what the reviews are like once it is used.  I suspect this is more branding and marketing that anything functionally new.  But we are kind of at that point.  Bitcoin works, it's time to sell it to specific markets, this one is as good as any.

@_date: 2013-04-21 06:19:00
The way I see it those of us who are buying in early are taking the risk so that there is a bitcoin for people to buy into latter. We are rewarded by the system for doing this, more risk more potential gain.  Bitcoin will get better as it grows, it seems banks are getting worse, at some point those trust levels may cross, that will be a happy day for some.
@_date: 2013-03-05 23:26:47
Doesn't matter.  The great thing about the way bitcoin effects business is that you don't have to push people do act.  I is it's own incentive.  Bitcoin will succeed where other projects (liberty dollar) didn't for the same reason BeOS is dead, and virtually every large company now depends on systems running Linux.  BeOS was a lot better system at the time.  Linux provided a cost incentive. 
I am arguing with the same people about the future of Bitcoin now that were arguing against Linux in the 90's and now use it at work.  It's the same concept.

I don't think so, at some point prior to widespread adoption there will have to be trusted/insured places for normal users to keep bitcoins much the way they keep $ in Banks and Paypal and spend it with checks and debit cards.  Hardware wallets are an option as well.

I don't think it's fair to say nobody cares.
I would rather not watch people get ripped off, but lets face it there was a pretty good chance this was going to happen with at least one of those markets.
More to the point, what are we supposed to do about it?  
Will it effect the price?  Maybe, at some point, I would be surprised if whoever did this dumped it in large chunks while people are still watching their address.  It seems to me like the smart thing to do would be to sit on it until bitcoin is much bigger and they easily spend it or convert it without drawing any attention.  But again, what are we going to do about it?

Small amount to them yes, relatively small investment compared to their existing ventures.  However one with much greater potential profit margin.  A large buy in could be worth billions if they can push bitcoin into mainstream, if they take it seriously I don't see them leaving that money on the table.
They could be doing it slowly over time, perhaps they have been for a while.  I don't happen to think that's happening yet, could be wrong though, clearly they are paying attention.

Had someone explained to me the issues they were about to have I would have expected these things to kill the exchange or very nearly kill it.  USD withdrawal seems pretty important to the whole deal.
But as myself and others still have money in it, still trade there, still have the chart open all day every day, they still have the highest volume.  Maybe Mt should be dead, but it is very much alive.
@_date: 2013-08-26 05:09:34
The people who make bitcoin big are not going to do it because they are Libertarian, Statist or any other political ideology.  They will do it for the money.  Fortune 500 companies don't use Linux because they believe in free software or open source ideals, they use it because it's more profitable to use it.  Businesses will adopt bitcoin as it scales to meet their needs for the same reasons they adopted Linux.
I remember trying to explain many years ago now to someone how this was going to happen for Linux.  Now it has.
Linux is to BeOS 
Bitcoin is to e-gold
Only two things limit bitcoin, it's technical capabilities and it's liquidity.  The free software model insures that it's technical development cannot be undone.  Even under extreme government suppression bitcoin would have vast black and grey markets to thrive in.
I think the government suppression is not likely come on fast enough to push bitcoin out of white markets.  It provides far too much profit incentive to be ignored.  Those in power who understand it will want to profit from it.

I am a merchant on the Newegg Marketplace.  It might be worth noting that I make more sales on Coingig.com and Bitmit.net each than I do listing largely the same products on my Newegg.com merchant account.
Newegg really needs to draw some attention to their market, bitcoin would be a great way to do that.  They also really need to work on the interface and layout of it, there are some very serious issues on the usability on the merchant end, even compared to the relatively small and new bitcoin sites.

It mattered mainly because it drew attention and helped get more people merchants on board.  From what I can tell most of that growth in knowledge and use is not in China and is uneffected by this.  It is also unlikely that this will looses us most of what is in China either, I think it's still much smaller there than what it could be even in a truely banned status.
In my eyes the benefit has been realized, nothing China says can take away the golobal press attention or the new users / merchants added globaly.

I don't think "essentially closed" is fair, most of the bitcoins have owned, I had to get without being able to do transfers from my bank.  To date almost none of my bitcoin transactions use the banking system at all.  The loophole is still very much open, it's just being pushed out of the mainstream because China does't want a rush of money leaving though it before they figure out what to do.  I doubt China is short sighted enough to outright ban it.  Bitcoin has huge economic potential and even at this early stage I would be shocked if China didn't want a piece of it.

I would just wait.  I know we all feel like there should be a lawsuit here, but in reality you just don't have anything to gain.
You can see current shipping here:
You will still have to wait a long time.  I just got my BFL Single a few days ago (ordered June 23rd 2012) twice the size stated and even worse on the power usage.  However still profitable.
You spent $30,000 on a machine that at the current hash rate would generate something like $1K a day worth the coin.  Even after another two months you will probably still be able to make money on this mining, not to mention resale being unreasonably high.  Is it what you paid for NO, should you be upset, YES.  However you can't claim any losses, you can only claim that you didn't make as much money as you wanted to, that seems like a very weak argument to me.  I would be shocked if anyone could get back more than the lawyer would cost.
Now I paid in BTC, so I could argue I lost the value BTC would be worth had I kept them.  It's tempting, but I can't imagine getting a court to award me BTC value.

It is but it needs acceptance to drive the value to make it a better store of wealth.  I think the real 'killer app' here is cutting credit cards and banks out of retail/wholesale transactions for customers/retailers/wholesalers/manufacturers.  
I sell to customers where I pay a fee on every Paypal/Credit card transaction.  On the other end the the manufacturers are paying a fee to charge my VISA card and they are likely charging purchases from whoever makes all their products.
Aside from the products them selves how many credit card or wire transfer fees are involved in the whole process of getting an item made distributed and shipped to a customer?  A couple percent at each jump adds up.
Once it is big enough to be an option it's hard for me to imagine why big retailers wouldn't want to accept it.  eBay get's mentioned a lot, but they are actually one of the few who have a legitimate reason not to.  It competes with their own business.  Operations like Walmart or Starbucks on the other hand have nothing to loose by adding bitcoin, and if they can drive a few percent of their credit transactions over to the bitcoin side they stand to save quite a lot of money.

When I had my iPhone I was not allowed to update it or backup my data.  Why, I only had Linux computers, you couldn't run iTunes on Linux (you can, it's just not usable), and you have to use iTunes to do those things.  I know there are workarounds now, then there wasn't.  Their whole business model is to force you into there system.  You have to use iTunes, and on a Mac if you want it to work well and not eat up all your ram.

Limited supply yes, but not that limited.
There are 21 million each divisible into 100 million pieces.
If I can do my maths, that would give us 2,100,000,000,000,000 individual units of exchange.
Compare to existing currency in circulation:
We have a very very long way to go before not having enough coins is an issue, and there are a number of ways to deal with it if it ever is.
We could create a small currency pegged to bitcoin for small transactions, we could potentially extend bitcoin to subdivide further.  We could use multiple digital currencies.
The bottom line is for this to really be an issue at all, bitcoin has to be not only successful, it has to practically take over the other major currencies.

3. Bill pay service, I want somewhere I can go and put in the information to all my accounts (cable, phone, electric) and drop bitcoins there for how much I want to pay.

Bitcoin is growing, China had little to no actual bitcoin use, just speculation.  Given we have lost a lot of that speculation, however since we had it we have made a lot of actual gains in the rest of the world.  
No, the future is not assured to be like the past, however it was apparent to me after the $30 bubble that this was the likely growth patter for bitcoin.  The only thing that surprised me about April was how high it went before dropping.  So in April it fell but gained a lot of attention and built up to another bubble that unsurprisingly came sooner than the last one.  
Nothing about recent news indicates a change in this pattern.  I can dismiss the crash because I have been expecting it and nothing about bitcoin or it's potential market has changed.
The only thing really annoying about this sub is all the people wining about it on here.  I see more wining about how many of this post or that than I do of the things everyone is complaining about.

I personally bet heavy on BTC, but doing that is not for everyone, especially if you want to sleep well.  While I am quite confident my coins will someday be worth $1K each and then some, diversification is good, and I'm not at all regretting that I bought a house last year despite how much more my BTC would be worth now.  Bitcoin is awesome, maybe even the most awesome thing, but there you have to do other things than watch the bitcoin price, and hand I not invested in my business and spent time on that and fixing my new house up I think bitcoin day trading might have driven me mental by now.

Amazon is not a solution they are a problem.
We should be supporting and expanding venues that already accept bitcoin and getting smaller ones to join in.
I personally am really happy selling on Coingig.com I am actually making more than twice the sales there as on my Newegg.com seller account.  There is also Bitmit.net and Atomicmall.com accepts bitcoin from merchants and is working on it for buyers.
Bitcoin is part of the solution to Amazon's dominance of online sales.  We should be help smaller venues to enjoy the advantage that can be had by using bitcoin for as long as possible.
Amazon takes huge percentages of a sellers profit, requires them to sell at a lower price than any other online offering.  They will let merchants grow to the point where their businesses depend on Amazon then suspend or cancel their accounts, often with no warning or reason and hold all of their money for 90+ days.
Source: personal experience
Amazon regularly holds millions of dollars of merchants money so that they can profit from it's use while merchants suffer or go out of business.
A class action has been filed: 
Actual Lawsuit:
Amazons business model is not good for merchants or customers.  Would their acceptance help bitcoin?  Of course, but it is too early they are to big, bitcoin is not stable enough or liquid enough to handle that influx of volume at this time.  
We should use bitcoin to make better marketplaces that reduce economic friction.  I would love to see a marketplace with an amazon catalog style setup more like reddit where you could have categories and subcategories with moderators, user voting and comments.  Most importantly where the sales venue is not competing with it's own sellers and stealing their sales as soon as the items get profitable enough.
Bitcoin removes the need for central processing of payments.  Slapping a bitcoin button on Amazon might be great from an investment point of view but it really falls short of our true potential.

If Bitcoin is a success, you will make money either way.
I just got a notice that my BFL Single shipped today.  I will make much much less bitcoin from it in the whole rest of my life than I paid for it.  However I have not even the slightest concern about it paying out more than the dollar value of the bitcoins I paid for it.
Unless your miner never arrives you will not likely loose value, you just will not make nearly as much as you would have just buying bitcoin.

If bitcoin takes a double digit slice of the pie it is going to exert some downward pressure on the value of currencies being traded for it.  This effect is currently not large enough to be relevant, but that 13% has to come from somewhere.  A large part of that is likely to come out of USD, and since USD is the base value we are measuring BTC against we should probably add a good 10-15% to that number,

Well assuming there are 11 Million coins for sale they would each get one assuming that many were for sale at the price those 11 Million people were willing to pay.
Since the market is just order matching in theory it could go down while people buy in, it just depends on what prices they place orders at and if people are willing to accept orders.
Since there is hardly more coins than that in circulation many (most?) of these new buyers would have to sell their coins the same day to make this possible.  If they didn't there would quickly be no coins left on the market and therefor no price.

I really hope they start loosing market share with this.  If they want to be in this business they have be be reliable.

Sure, but how much damage can you claim and is that number greater than the cost to sue.  This is the kind of thing a class action could accomplish if the offence was on a very large scale or if your example was a local dealer you could file in small claims court.  Small claims is the only place this would be cost effective to do, I could be wrong bit it doesn't seem to me like that would be worth doing from a distance.
I have no doubt what they have done is illegal or that you would be able to win a case, just that it's not worth hiring a lawyer for.  At least not unless you really spent a lot on it.
I notice I have gotten quite a few down votes for this.  It's easy to down vote, if you think I'm wrong, put your money where your mouth is and sue them.  I would be happy to be proven wrong, they did the same thing to me.

Well most things are not cheaper because most merchants accepting bitcoin are very small and cannot compete price wise with places like Wal-Mart or Amazon.
My company  sells it's products cheaper on coingig.com for bitcoin that we do on our own site.
It is a great tool for me and my business.  It allow me to expose my product line to a larger market.  I actually sell less product on my Newegg.com Marketplace account than I do on either Coingig.com or Bitmit.net  As other retailers and service providers realize the benefit there will be more of an advantage to customers.  This will take time.
Bitcoin is great for me because I make use of it in a wide variety of ways and really enjoy exploring it's potential.  For most people it is not there yet.  I think it will be very soon, there is not really any technical limitation at this point to using bitcoin for customers or businesses, it just needs marketshare for businesses to care and acceptance for customers to care.  These two must keep pace with each other and it will take some time.  My feeling is that it will accelerate fairly quickly.
I guess I would tell you to sit on your coins until you see something you want to use them for.  It will come.

Do you keep most of your money in a savings account or your wallet you carry with you.  My largest wallet (and most of those I would guess are peoples largest) has not had a transaction in over a year.  While my personal wallet on my pc, my blockchain wallet I use with my android app, and the wallet I setup for my business (that I use to buy equipment, and pay employees) have few coins at any time but many transactions.

Well using this calculator the ASIC I have on order would cost me $0.12 per day in electric.
At current difficulty this shows a net profit for a month at: 252.61 USD
Given I paid in BTC and will never have a chance at making that back, but in $ it would take an absurdly high difficulty to make me unplug something that cost me less to run than some of the light bulbs in my house.
If I remove my cost of equipment (since it's paid for) and turn up the difficulty to 100M I still make $1K+ a month profit after electric.  Who in their right mind would not plug that in.

I run Ubuntu for my personal use.  I run WinXP in Virtual Box, mainly to log into my Newegg seller account.  Newegg uses Silverlight, aside from being an unbelievable terrible interface to work in it only loads on Windows with silverlight installed and even then it's pretty flakey.
I like Mint for laptops I use for work out in the field, for my other business (inventory service)  Though the software I use should work on most any Linux distro.

I'm thinking it was actually 2011 I was attempting to start my own inventory service, didn't like the equipment/software available and had a terrible time getting anyone local to build me a working system.  I used one of the early bitcoin job sites to hire someone an ocean away who wrote me an amazing inventory program.  I paid him a day at a time for each update and tweak in bitcoin.  The cost and time of any other payment system would have made the whole deal a non starter.
I purchased a fair chunk of my supplies to start the business with bitcoin (some with an amazon for btc service, some direct).  I now have two part time employees who take their entire pay in bitcoin.  
This Febuary I started  where I accept bitcoin for purchases, as well as selling on coingig.com and bitmit.  A small percentage of my sales but even when I give a discount for bitcoin the margin is better than with paypal or credit card.
I have also accepted rent from a tenant in the form of bitcoin once or twice.

Part of Bitcoins design is incentive to use it, invest in it's currency, it's code and it's infrastructure.  
Other distributed currencies, especially forks of bitcoin that can use it's same infrastructure and can piggy back on it's acquired confidence will likely coexist or possibly even overtake bitcoin at some point.  But without the profit incentive to grow bitcoin it might suffer the fate of Esperanto.

So far I am liking Coingig best, I have sold more on Bitmit, but it seems messier.  I recently tried to list on bitdazzle and ran into a lot of issues, with item options and prices showing up properly, hopefully they will fix that.
We really need someone to implement a market that is not exclusively bitcoin, but offers better rates for both merchants and buyers when transactions take place with bitcoin vs Paypal/Google...  This can be done without the market it's self having non bitcoin accounts because a merchants payment service can be passed though to the buyer.  Someone do it!

How many millions of man hours would it take to track and confirm all the bitcoin addresses and transactions of everyone in say the United States?
Millions of bitcoin addresses can be generated on the fly by people anywhere with little effort, coins can be transferred back and forth over basically any internet connection.  Sure once you connect a person to an address you can see their transactions, but tracking down even a hand full of people who don't want their identity tried to an address is a monster of a task.  I don't even know how many bitcoin addresses I have. 
You can use a new address for every transaction if you like, and the location the transaction appears to come from is just what location the computer is at that put that transaction on the network, doesn't mean the person spending or buying live on that side of the planet.

I wouldn't be surprised to find out about organized efforts to control bitcoin marketshare, but this is a pretty long list to be all in on the same scheme.  The decentralized nature of bitcoin and geographical scale make this centralized of control pretty unlikely.  It also seems like theres a few mining pools missing from this cabal, thats a pretty important control for bitcoin after all.  I am also pretty sure exchange lag, downtime and sell offs are a problem for everyone, not just you.

Yes it's a dollar per hr wage, yes because BTC prices are unstable (and tax reasons).  But it's silly to think these market conditions will continue forever, and it does not to me invalidate BTC in any way to measure it in dollars, after all most everything is, including other currencies.

I use it for everything I can, I accept it on my very small website where I do get some btc sales.  I have two very part time employees (and an over seas programmer) who take their entire pay in bitcoin.  I have yet to convince any of my suppliers to accept it directly, but I can say it is getting use.  Between myself and friends we probably trade as much btc as $ for things, silver and computer hardware being our 3rd and 4th currencies.
It is growing, it just isn't growing at the rate the price was going up.  I still think bitcoin will get big, probably very fast, but even in the world of bitcoin things take time.  Proper business have to be setup, software has to be written.  We are going to have to wait several months for those who became interested in April to develop bitcoin tech and business.  Infrastructure takes time.  I would love to see a killer app drive it, but I don't think the lack of one will in any way diminish the potential of bitcoin.
