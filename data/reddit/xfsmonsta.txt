People are hugging and having sex with their monies, because they missed it for a while. Once they're done, everything is going to be normal :D

They promised to return money

Let's say 1 output has 0.0003 BTC in it, and 2nd output has 0.0002 BTC in it. So all I have to do is delete second address in that tutorial and specify as an amount during 1st step (createrawtransaction) 0.00048 right (0.00002 goes as a fee to miner in this case). Is this right logic of thinking?

which private key formats are supported by bitcoin-qt?

Why am I, Russian, keep finding out news not in Russian web-sites?
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:04:18
I think they can borrow money. And once customers will realize that money is not going to disappear, trade will operate in a normal mode
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:05:55
first few weeks people gonna feel insecure, but borrowing money will completely resolve this issue, since the name of company and its domain name is what is the most expensive; not some rumors

Also I find very convenient Blockchain.info API which could be used to accept transactions with Bitcoins if you're a programmer. Hi from python :D
Blockchain.info has convenient iOS mobile wallet because its can be synchronized with your web-wallet, and there is no wallet that is offering such thing in Bitcoin space (multiplatform wallet which synchronizes easily as 1 click on different devices).
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:57:35
also he can bribe a miners if Bitcoins are originated from BitFinex hack :)
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:56:49
Sell some to me nigga
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:30:30
Its because Mycelium supported only on iPhones above 6S
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:25:25
The same like blockchain.info which in spite of million dollars budgets still can't fix translation in Russian (but their product still works!)
I still think that amount of job done is pretty good for a company running on the shoulders of 1 developer even at production levels.
I think bot can be experienced at intuitive level, but yeah I understand that for communication/network-centric/social software its important to be even more intuitive without teaching people, nobody wants to be a pioneer to have pains of teaching anyone in closer circles. But for me personally most important thing is how fast bot works and how reliable and secure it is. Maybe you're right in terms of first steps complexity (like signing up first time somewhere) but its not that hard as it might seem, maybe you haven't got used to Telegram yet?
@_date: 2016-06-01 01:11:13
add  into Telegram contact list after installing  or after finding Telegram in your mobile App Store or Play Market
@_date: 2016-06-02 13:07:40
its just a bot version of localbitcoins to connect people
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:17:32
This message has been written right before he replied. Are you getting paid by LocalBitcoins to shill them?
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:21:56
I am sorry but in Russia you can't exchange Bitcoins by other methods. And since they are the leading company now in my region, and no other options is given for me and many other users, yes I will complain about customer satisfaction.
And when they do harm to reputation of bitcoins in my country, I'm going to become very upset and will blame everyone, including regular Bitcoin people for not acting against this monopoly.
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:28:56
Why I should pay for that?
Since I use LB for 4 years, and brought many customers there, and spent a lots of efforts and money paying their fees, I believe I am personally have some rights to be at least treated with some respect and attention, not only from LB, but from this community.
When I speak up about some common and regular problems here, its currently affecting total reputation of Bitcoins. You might not care, but that doesn't mean that everyone shouldn't.

the buying process is too complicated for average user. I'm need working solution to teach people easy ways of using Bitcoin. LocalBitcoins is the easiest way currently to buy Bitcoins, but they seem to have systemic failures in providing their service in our region correctly. Main issues are lack of mobile interface, they very often close accounts without reasons, they do everything to complicate signing up for new users, and they make a lots of other mistakes.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:25:27
hand to hand
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:19:13
In order to start dealing with someone, LocalBitcoins requires verifying your own phone number specified in your profile.
You can't receive the SMS message to confirm your phone number.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:24:04
you moved the market
@_date: 2016-12-01 11:14:46
Fucking monopolists... And the whole Bitcoin getting ugly.
@_date: 2016-12-10 00:42:47
80% of people here in Russia, use your "abroad" services to conduct illicit activity peer to peer, while remaining 20% (regular people) don't have economic incentive because the whole platform is so damn complicated and such a time waster, that its easier to pay intermediaries in fiat for legal deals who at least do transactions for them simpler.
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:08:33
This is very sad news
@_date: 2016-09-21 03:31:40


No I don't. Because its an address custodially owned by third-party service called BitMixer which I am complaining about here.
@_date: 2016-09-21 03:29:21
I am not laundering anything and my accounts and personality are totally open to publicity.
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:00:19
How can I bake bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:07:12
I'm using it too for a 4 months already!
@_date: 2016-09-21 03:30:24
nice place.
@_date: 2016-09-21 03:33:59
I do use  - very useful tool, but for automation and offline signing on an enterprise level, I would recommend using for signing scripts on a Linux shell.
@_date: 2016-05-26 13:22:22
its not the solution for Russia &amp; CIS countries.
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:24:03
are you serious?
