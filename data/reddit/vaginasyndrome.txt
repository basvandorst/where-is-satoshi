Somehow advertise yourself and bitcoin locally or do it for charity and donate a portion of your deposits. Otherwise why broadcast on the blockchain that you are paying yourself? just my 2c

because everyone is waiting for a free ride on the coattails of big money. no one has any money left to buy, or they are trying to convince themselves that if it goes lower then they will buy. where if you asked anyone 3 months ago if they would buy at sub $400 they would but now that we are here they want it to go lower to buy. this community is a joke.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:49:07
What I am getting at is the whales and the weak hands(both are separate) Both are itching to get back in. Where else is a whale going to put his money? Weak hands will get back in when they realized they let emotions get the best of them. Sux that we are lower than we should be but he who can we complain to?

@_date: 2014-09-20 02:05:42
there havent been many buyers and when we started falling nobody stepped up and bought, so the price was actually gaining momentum. no worries, this is just part of a game the whales play. If wall street type money gets in they are finished.

Tbh I would be happy with $1000 next year ;) I think sooner rather than later there is going to be a scarcity/shortage issue. As the price goes down more are able to be accumulated for less fiat. Demand awareness and adoption are always increasing and the supply of available bitcoin is shrinking whenther we like it or not. So whether the price is at $100 or $1000 I hope  there will come a time where the limited number of coins in existence would reward us(everyone invested in Bitcoin now) for risking our fiat now :)

All those numbers dont mean a thing. WE have been dealing with the mined coins all year and there have been ebbs and flows. Which is caused by whales. They know the writing is on the wall once institution sized money starts getting in. The larger whales have 1000 btc, new institution hedgies or wall street $$ would be 5000 minimum. its going to happen.

why do people always say the market value is 'X' and that is what someone is willing to buy/sell? This isnt cut and dry economics fucking 101!!!!
I will give you a perfect example.  10 millionaire friends all approach an early adopter friend and say" we all want to buy 10000 btc each,the Miner has 10 wallets preloaded with 10k bitcoin on each.  They hand over the money at market price, the adopter hands over the wallets. 100,000 bitcoin just exchanged hands. This doesnt affect the price because it is unknown, if it were known the real true price could be justified.
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:04:12
its all hear say on otc. If I buy $10 million in bitcoin on  a preloaded paper wallet who knows other than me and the seller?

I have come to the conclusion that this is just part of the game. I have bought at higher levels so this is a buying op for me. Talk of $340-$300 is nonsense. We had been making higher lows and overshot this low by about 10% ($440) There is no bad news just pure manipulation. Prior to today there really were not many buyers on the order books and they are way to thin. Until we get more avenues to make Bitcoin easier to buy this is what is going to happen. We have exchanges currently opening in Korea, India and hopefully down the road Africa. So this is going to help. No worries it will go back up soon.
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:55:09
you mean there is a few controlling the price????? from what everyone says its miners dumping coins, or merchants cashing in, or people giving up, or early adopters cashing in, or hedge funds shorting, or the otc trades, or bitlicense, or mt gox, or china, or .__________(fill in the blank) so which is it?

Oh sorry I must be in the forum that only deals with cold hard facts. 
Whales enjoy your last feast. Bitcoin whales didnt move the price today, that was institution type money. I am guessing a $10-15 million buy? Whales who are "traders" are getting weaker. Keep selling your coins now whales for your $40 pop, hope you get caught fiat next move.

The seller has stopped you have been manipulated into selling. But all is not lost you can get back in and ride back up with us. Everyone is saying $350 I am going the other way and saying $450+. I believe in public contrary opinion. Its been wrong but its been correct more. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:41:34
everyone says $ we are going to $350 or lower I am betting the other way.  Contrary public opinion never fails. $450 by Monday. Then when everyones bank wires get to the exchanges on Monday/Tuesday  we go up. Total manipulation.

good call that is the way I look at it. I am thinking only 15-18 million max due to lost coins in the future. The supply is always diminishing and the demand will always be there. So its just a matter of time. g/l
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:37:59
I think we are at the floor right now. Everyone thinks $350 or lower is the floor but look at the accumulation on Bitstamp. Nice size blocks of coin being accumulated. If we were going lower the selloff would have just continued. It stopped with a little bit of elasticity at $400. Up we go from here.
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:27:45
Big money just got in. That was the last call ;)
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:24:41
Btc-e is usually lower because it is difficult to get fiat into and out of that exchange. So if someone wanted to take advantage of this arbitrage, they would need to wire money there which takes a few days. Btc-e is legit. This difference in price will gradually disappear in the next day or so when the banks open monday. There are arbitrage opportunities everywhere localbitcoins.com is another usually a 10% markup. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:56:33
One day the exchanges will say "shortage" and then there most likely will never be excess bitcoins ever again. Just think about it. There are stock IPO's that issue 20 million shares they are all sold and they can be diluted forever. Bitcoin cant. Win-Win.

Gimmie a fucking break your average computer geek has on average one bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:49:27
I just want the price to get back to $500 so i can sell out and be done. I will then wait til we are up around $1000 before I get back in. So I will have half as many coins as I would have but at least I know I will be buying into an uptrend. Watching this shit go down day after day all year is fucking ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:32:11
these are definetly stolen coins being dumped. nobody keeps dumping day after day into the lows. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:48:07
this is past capitulation. this is pure market manipulation by the whales. They are playing games amoungst themselves and everyone else is just riding their coattails. Mass adoption, supply and demand, early adopters or stolen coins etc really has no effect if you have all the chips. This is actually good. All the newcomers to btc will make more because they will get more for their money and secondly, there isnt much meat on the bone if this thing is going to actually work. Way too much upside for people not to buy just one coin and hold onto it.

Why do you want to argue? You have no idea what is going on behind the scene and either do I. All I can say is from the looks of things the price is being manipulated lower. Weak hands are selling and the whales are in fiat. There is no where else for the whales to put their fiat other than back into Bitcoin eventually, same goes for the weak hands who sold. They will buy back in at some point. There really is no quitting bitcoin completely for anyone once you are in imo. This is my last response mr troll.
