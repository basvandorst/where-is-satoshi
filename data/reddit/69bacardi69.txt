Nice looking app, like the slider for the timeframe periods.

Hopefully you took a pic of the QR code or wrote down the alphanumeric sequence. If not you will probably have to contact support for each 2FA you have.

Hopefully it stays over 9k this time
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:50
12 198$ CAN on Coinbase here in Canada.

Probably just testing 9k for now &amp; getting ready to shatter it in the very near future

RemindMe! Of this in 1 year.

I get what your saying, but even .25$ on a 7-8$ purchase is still alot.

1.47$ is pretty expensive
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:26:41
Good point, but my point is that BTC fees are a little expense vs some others.

It is a form of digital currency, so yes!
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:03:23
I agree 100%

Fuck this guy, he's garbage
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:28:13
Fuck that Garbage!
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:43:54
Hopefully the BTC fees will go down a little bit more.

Stupid question. If someone knew that, he'd already be rich. Don't invest if you're afraid to lose it.
