It's both. 
ed. In China the character 元 can be used, which is pronounced the same as "yuan", and in Japan the character 円 can be used which is pronounced (in Japanese) the same as "en" (which although is pronounced as yuan and *could* be used as a character for currency in Mandarin, largely isn't).

It's a different site with the same article, Reddit won't catch that. ;)

When Bitcoin is transacted between two people, a fee is paid to incentivise miners to mine it. There is a typical algorithmic "minimum" determined by the size of the transaction, age of the bitcoin used and priority, but generally the standard is about 10-40 cents.
So as it stands, the current reward for successfully mining a block is 25BTC plus the fees for the transactions in that block. At the moment, the reward still vastly outweighs the transaction fees, but as more transactions occur and the block reward starts to shrink, the fees will become more and more important, and eventually outweigh the block reward.
If you go to the [recent blocks mined on blockchain.info]( and check some of the blocks, you can see the amount of fees paid to miners to process the entire block.

There's plenty of applications already. All you need is someone's secret key to generate their auth key.

Google's Two-Factor authentication can be done in several ways.
The Authenticator application for phones or the HTML5 application give a code that the SMS sent to you from Google would also give you.
The other applications still require the second factor of "owning" the application(s) with your Google-issued secret key beforehand.

As far as I understand it, (which honestly, isn't particularly well) it's just to incentivize people into using their Android App Store.
