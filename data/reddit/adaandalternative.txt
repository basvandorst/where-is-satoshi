Oh, I'm so sorry we are not able to transfer you back in time physically now. Butterfly effect and so on, you know... But we are working over it. Stay tuned with us!

Hi, everyone!
**Mapofcoins was updated today!**
Now there are even MORE coins -  
And not-bitcoin based coins were also included to the history of cryptocurrencies - 
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:06:38
* about Argcoin - it's an error. Thx for remark
* BBQcoin is abbreviated as BQC (look at august 2012 view). Also you can check github .json file to find out other coins now. But we are about to realize search option on the site for your convenience.

Please send me a prooflink. In the next update I'll add a function to show dead coins.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:05:41
Thanks but the last link doesn't work. Are there any links to IndigoCoin?
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:01:06
You're making me blush! :)
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:01:51
I'll be waiting for your email but it seems I've understood what you were trying to say :)
I'm also working on something similar and you will see the map design this week. I wouldn't really like to see it colorful since this could make it hard to comprehend. But there will be filters that could show coins with a similar algorithm etc.
Thanks for your advice! It's important for me that you care.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:47:41
Glad to hear that! Please keep me posted.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:05:42
**We've made New Update!**
 
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:04:39
Unfortunately, most likely the update will be postponed till the beginning of the week.
Map design changes and filters turned out to be more time-consuming than I thought.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:07:05
Thank you for the contribution!
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:49:59

And check if the JewelCoin has a source code. It is the starting point of coin-to-map process!

I'm going to update the repository soon. However you can make changes now.
I would be glad to use your information about coins. Thanks!

@_date: 2015-02-24 14:07:03
I like your idea about creating the unique coin for my project but I don't want to monetize the project the following way. My core idea was to maintain a big collection of cryptocurrencies and see how they will develop within the time! 
If someone has ideas for future development of this project, you're welcome to Contribution Section 
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:59:07
Let me know what you choose ;)
I'm working on the mobile version of the website. Can you describe the problems in more detail please?
@_date: 2015-02-27 11:45:21
It wouldn't be just update of coins' info! Hope, we'll roll out new features like new visualization of Bitcoin map, new search filters. 
The update will be next week as there are too many requests from our users.  
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:06:13
Thanks, this resource was made to attract not only devs but also such kind of audience that are interested in the history of cryptocurrency itself.
