If a temporary 1.5% dip in the market is a crash, Bitcoin crashes multiple times a day.

Bitcoin is volatile and it's possible he wouldn't have been able to afford the financing or lease at somepoint if there was a drop in BTC's value.
I don't think selling to buy a very expensive depreciating asset, but at least selling his Bitcoin to cover the full cost of the car was smart.

Since you are at the end of the year, you should try to structure some in December and some in January to spread your tax liability over 2 years.

Everything in existence only has value because people give it value. Gold is only worth something because people agree that it is. A dollar is only worth something because people agree that it is. Bitcoin is only worth something because people agree it is.

We have CNBC on all day at work and they are constantly talking about Bitcoin and not in a bad way.

But he didn't use his "real" name. He used his birth name. He legally changed his name after college and has been known as Dorian Nakamotos for the last 40 years. Using his birth name is actually a pretty good pseudonym.

This is not a U.S. problem; this is an OP is an idiot problem. There are plenty of solutions in the U.S. that are easier than both Western Union and Bitcoin. Western Union is when you need to send someone *physical cash* because electronic payments aren't possible.

As a financial advisor who meets with people daily, a scary amount of people have way too much money in cash still. An even scarier number if them have cash they are sitting on and have been sitting on it since they sold everything at a 40% loss in 2009.
I have a client who got a new job back in 2010 and rolled her 401k into an IRA with us shortly after. When it came over, it was 100% in cash and when i asked her why, she said her husband had convinced her to move it to cash. He was sitting in on the meeting and he was convinced the market was going to crash again so he had moved 100% of their liquid assets to cash. He said that while they weren't making money, they weren't losing it either. I explained inflation to him and how he was actually losing money in the sense that he was losing purchasing power as if things cost 3% more next year his pot of cash was worth 3% less. He disagreed with me and said her account balance is still $200k and his account balance was still $150k so I was wrong. She had warned me ahead of time about his feelings and how since he was unemployed, he sat around the house all day watching Fox News and they had him scared to death of how Obama was going to ruin the economy  so I just looked at her and she gave me a nod to indicate she understood how inflation works and we could move on without me needing to correct him further. 
Anyways, she became a client and we DCA'd her cash back into the market over a couple of months and she is still a client to this day and her account value is around $600k today. To this day, his $150k is still worth $150k and sitting in cash. He comes to every review with her and we both spend the first 15 minutes if the appointment trying to convince him to invest some of that money even if it is in a bank CD or something to get some interest to try to keep up with inflation. He spends the entire time trying to convince us that we are making a huge mistake and a **huge** market correction is coming any day now. Eventually he'll be right as a market correction will happen but at this point the market correction would need to result in a 67% loss that is so rapid we would be unable to sell to lock in any gains before her account was in a worse place than his. He is still unemployed and still watches Fox News and reads all sorts of economic doomsday bloggers/writers like Harry Dent who just provide more confirmation bias for him.

No no no.
Buy and hold with Bitcoin is not a safe bet, it is a highly speculative bet.
Past performance is not indicative of future gains. Past performance is not indicative of future gains. Past performance is not indicative of future gains. Any investment advertisement in the United States is required, by law, to contain that disclosure despite the fact that we have over 100 years of historical performance on the stock market that has, to date, proven that long term, diversified investments in U.S. equities is a pretty safe bet. Bitcoin has existed for 8 years it's volatility during that time is obviously well documented; the odds that you wakeup tomorrow and find Bitcoin worthless is way more likely than just about everywhere traditional investment.

A decentralized monetary system isn't a new concept; a global centralized monetary system is a new concept. Commodity anchored currencies were the standard for most currencies (certainly the important ones) until Bretton Woods when everyone pegged their currency to the dollar which was in turn pegged to gold. A global fiat currenciy system didn't exist until Nixon removed the USD from the Gold Standard in 1971.
Bitcoin is basically a return to rare commodity anchored currencies and is subject to the same problems that all commodity anchored currencies have. Arguably the biggest problem with them is the Golden Rule: he who has the gold, makes the rules. 
There are arguments for commodity anchored currencies and I'm not trashing Bitcoin, I own it as well, but it's ability to change billions of lives for the better and revolutionize the world is vastly overstated. Bitcoin is basically digital gold and it will definitely make a (relatively) few people much better off but if Bitcoin becomes the new global currency, for a vast majority of people thay make the switch years down the road, it won't be better or worse but instead a lateral move. The California Gold Rush was revolutionary as well but it didn't better the lives of a majority of people in the U.S. A few people got really rich, a few people lost everything, and for most people it was a lateral move economically and more of a geographical change.

Brussels is in Belgium. Brussels is home to many EU institutions like the European Commission, Council of the EU, European Council, and the de facto most important seat of European Parliament (due to proximity to other EU institutions in Brussels but the official seat of EU Parliament is in Strasbourg, France).
Brussels is basically the de facto "capital" of the EU (but it is not officially the capital as the EU doesn't have a capital). Therefore since Brussels is the de facto capital of the EU and Brussels is in Belgium, Belgium could also be considered the "capital" of the EU.

I don't think any one disagrees that a majority of the current debt is from paying off the original debt to French and German banks. Everyone gets that. What you seem to be missing is the fact that the original (now paid off debt) was from loans the Greek government took out for pensions, etc. and never repaid.
Let's try to rephrase this in a different, less government-y way:
1. You borrow money from Joe to buy a TV.
2. You don't pay Joe back so you are going to have to file for bankruptcy.
3. Your friend Jane decides to loan you money to pay Joe back so you don't have to file bankruptcy.
4. You don't pay Jane back either so you are going to have to file bankruptcy.
Now, according to you, the money Jane lent you wasn't to save your ass from your horrible TV purchase, it was to bailout that greedy Joe. While that might be technically true because the second loan was to pay off the first loan, but the fact of the matter is you wouldn't have needed a second loan to pay off the first if you hadn't borrowed money to buy the TV on the first place.

Short term capitals gains (ordinary income) are for investments held &lt;1 year.
Long-term capital gains are for investments held &gt; 1 year.

Absolutely. I wouldn't think twice about texting my wife, "We have to get my mom something for her birthday." In fact, I could probably look through my texts and find one from my wife saying, "What are we getting your dad for his birthday?"

Your are trying to rationalize a prisoners dilemma. You can't guarantee that no one will sell for less than 4200. Add to the fact that even if everyone holds, your coin loses value as new coins are created AND the fact that new coin is created for a fraction of 4200, someone will always be willing to sell for well less than 4200 as a sale price of 1000 is still almost pure profit. 
The stock market works the exact same way (except new shares aren't constantly being created). If all AAPL shareholders agree to not sell for less than 100, the price of AAPL will always be 100+. But people will ALWAYS sell because you can't buy groceries with a share of AAPL, you need to sell it to buy groceries. If no one is willing to buy at 100 and you really need groceries, you will break the "don't sell for less than 100" gentleman's agreement so you don't starve. Once someone sees the price dropped to 90, they will sell too as they don't want to lose money and it compounds exponentially especially with automatic stop losses on people's accounts. It literally only takes one person to sell to create a chain reaction.
With Bitcoin, you may be holding it as an investment whereas someone else is using to to sell goods. They don't care about holding, they care about converting to hard currency and will sell below 4200 if they need the liquidity. If investors in the stock market can't figure it out over the last few hundred years, Bitcoin isn't going to get everyone to agree to it. The only way to prevent this with some amount of success is to do what some companies/large investors do, create a standing buy at 4200 to artificially keep the value at or above 4200 until investor fears subside and the value shoots up again.
