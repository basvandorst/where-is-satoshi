So does this mean my incoming transaction which has been pending for 2 weeks of $500 with a $1.30 transaction fee will eventually confirm?
How about my two outgoing transactions of $100 each with a $1.70 fee and a $10 fee?  They've been stuck for about 10 days with no confirmations too
I mean, what happens if they never confirm?  Are they just going to be stuck forever?

God i hope this comes soon.  My bitcoin is currently unusable because of the insane fees or simply transactions being stuck forever because the fee wasn't high enough

Incoming, unconfirmed for 2.5weeks+:
Outgoing, unconfirmed for 10days+:
So whats going to happen?  Are they going to be stuck unconfirmed forever?  Or do they become higher and higher priority the longer they are on the network?

Can someone explain something for me?
I'm using a bitpay wallet (previously a bitcoin.com wallet) and you're telling me Bitpay is charging me fees to use my bitcoin?
So can u tell me where i can get a wallet that doesn't charge me fees?
Because currently the fees i am experiencing on Bitpay make bitcoin unusable right now (Fees bigger than the transaction themselves, or lower the fee amount and enjoy a transaction that gets stuck confirming for 10+ days)

Sounds like a load of shit to me.  
Bitcoin is unusable for me right now.  I got transactions that are stuck confirming for 2weeks and the fees are currently higher than the transaction themselves.
What a joke.  This is so broken
