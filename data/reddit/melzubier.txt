Yes.. good question.. who is buying.. volume of sales is increasing.. there is as much buying as selling.. the traded volume is 3+ times from last week

You can not hodl it.. it lives for a week or so..

Also one absurd thing that he compares btc with tulips.. tulip lives for one week or so, there it lakes the very function of currency.. one more thing the people back then bought unplanted bulbs.. I.e they bought deserted lands.. so how come NYC=tulips??!!

That's why regulation is good if not a must..

I wonder: Cryptos are product of liberaliterian aspiration.. or at least is inline with it.. liberalism is always pro regulation.. then why people flire up when hear regulation news.. well it's against Satoshi?? Is satoshi view is bubble??..
I'm pro and a believer of cryptos.. but I think responsible regulation will bust blocks in the way of wider spread..
On the contirary, keep rejecting legitimate responsible, and necessary change and e.g. regulation while it looks crucial to avert real threats will kill or at least hinder cryptos.. will be left behind at where at where refused to change.. history is full of such examples.. 
CHANGE.. CHANGE.. CHANGE

Until last bitcoin is mined there will be 21mill Max.. thus they can't be btc billionares.. and bitcoin ain't like stocks.. even if 1BTC=0 fiat it's real value can't be wiped off and it's store of value function also can't thus be disabled.. except for get-rich-instantly people..

Now starlink and blockstream satellites are up in the sky, for so sure no internet down anymore

I wonder is it possible, or foreseeable, to bring GPUs back into mining by making huge optimization to hashing process and/or the current PoW algorithm?? My believe it isn't impossible for the math that made it thus difficult to make it less difficult again. I wonder, too, what will be the response of the crypto market, by then.

Using reddit and bitcoin etc doesn't require bsc,msc etc.. but to decide whether bitcoin bubble,fad or fraud, u 1st got to earn EE math cs degree.. we actually living in the age of paperless newspapers , algorithmic accountants, algorithmic derivatives expert advisors etc.. the rise of math the rise of algos age.. etc thus having only ASc in math, EE, high techs can't qualify u as FINTECH expert now and near future..
..math(network+protocol+block chain+veterans) is more physical and tangible than goodwill that rockets stocks..
.. being deflationary btc price rocketiing can as well be due to increased velocity of circulation, increased adoption+"btc goodwill"
Luckily so far the majority of adopters of btc are who understand the math behind it and who understand the value and potential.. those are the pillars that prevent btc from tulip's melt down and evaporation.. in the mean time non-math people will realize the whole truth of btc.. now we are in the middle of that mean time.. btc jump from high to fresh ATH everytime it's challenged and given a chance to reveal its strengths and endurance on the face of the greed, grudge and panic of vintage FAT CATs.. e.g 2013, 2016 and now 2017.. on the contrary, understanding, trust and adoption is booming.. if in doubt ask digital-age expert Mr. GOOGLE etc
Still.. get your ASc,BSc, .. DSc or whatever, out of the vintage box.. secure your ticket in the FUTURE train����������..

Bitcoin is real and "digitally" physical- by math, and much more, in line and goes hand by hand with what good the tech future holds for people.. you seem stuck inside oldies box.. try think out of that box..  and restudy cryptos in line with the broad tech and humanity future

If all ASIC miners switch off there are millions of crypto enthusiasts are ready to deploy their CUPs to save the network.. actually this would be great opportunity, instead. THE PHOENIX...
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:17:40
My question, is the overt version rolling needs permission? Or is it patent-able to anybody?.. as I know version bits, except certain bits, can freely be changed.. that clear in the literature published way before ASICBoost

You missed the point that this system is dynamic like many other economical systems and sure it will come to an equilibrium point.. the high volatility u r seeing now , yes, the system is in high instability region, one reason I guess is the the number of adopters e.I. market size is still small(=little damping effect).. one other thing is the disturbance from outside the system is huge(=FUD) and the big "banks" cats fight against it..
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:09:03
Yes, this a good lesson to the get rich and speculators who derailed crypts from the very track as a currency and store of value.. this crash would be good for cryptos if those ppl learn the lesson and let the price at these levels.. however, if the price grew with growing adoption and use just then the ecosystem will be healthy and on track..
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:25:25
Yes in control/dynamic system theory the stability point is very close to the highest instability point.. but the adverse effects of FUD, gov. big vantage cats and banks fight is elongating the time to settle.. but so far crypts proved that they can not be killed, at least easily.. but in fact they seem will survive and adoption is accelerating.. cause crypts are good for the ppl, and the war against it is mostly based on greed and fair and ppl know that.. although I'm pro fair and sound regulation of cryptos by gov.

I think mathematics have all answers, but we are yet to find out those answers and solutions to compete with the q.computers... the very answers is to do more math..

If he bought  BTC at ATH  and sold at the today's price by now his remaining worth must have been €26K+ not 6.3K..

It really ingenious idea to cut down this overhead.. The problem has an essence of error correcting codes.. I wonder whether the vast theory of error correcting codes be applicable for solving this problem?? It is really interesting coding theory research problem..
