ok, I created a new wallet and moved them there. What now
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:15:54


Is there a leaked document about this I missed? I'm genuinely curious.

Memes on official p2p foundation blog look really professional.

I still think that FBI, DHS or another US agency has the coins thanks to silk road investigation and has put a gag order on Mark.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:38:56
I think that's only one of his worries. The second one is jail, since it looks like US gov is involved and they take money laundering seriously. (if it's not them doing the laundering...)

Conspiracy theorists are gonna have a field day
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:16:50
In a mall with thousands of other people staring at their phone at the same time. Met him in a local hackerspace on invite only "bitcoin party".
Yup, I feel pretty safe.
At the end of the day, bitcoin is as anonymous as cash, if you know what you're doing.

I came here to say the same. I know some cypriots and they **hate** banks. The whole country completely despises banking system. I think Neo&amp;Bee chose the best country for rollout.

There may be multiple reasons, including gag order, acquisition or pure resignation from his part. It's gotta be hard to have this huge pressure on your shoulders, I'm not surprised by his acting.
I've lost money on gox, but cut that guy some slack please. You'd be shitting your pants too.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:21:06
I agree with everything you said.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:50:30
You can't really spend your money when you're in jail or hiding from the US world police
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:33:12
People here are forgetting that gox is a regular company under Japanese law. If they declare  bankruptcy, their assets will be auctioned/sold and claimants will be repaid their share. 
On the other hand, claiming BTC under  Japanese law will be tricky for us westerners. Also I don't think that history screenshots will cut it...

From what I gathered for the last few years, they don't give a damn

I bought my latest 5BTC from a dude in cash, in a shopping mall. I've got no idea how is it possible to tie those coins to me.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:50:18
One hour old post and not one comment from tothemoon guy?!
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:37:11
Jokes aside, I bet that mafia had at least some money in gox. They won't be happy, maybe someone will have an unfortunate accident... not that I condone that, but it's plausible

Even though I despise him for being one of those PHP fanboys, which in my opinion led to all of these problems... it's easy to say many things in hindsight

I'm not aware of any SC with simple DES currently used for financial services, but admittedly I know only a couple of systems.  
Another thing to ponder is that it's very hard (I'd say almost impossible without great financial trouble) to even get to a point in SC reverse engineering, where you need to think about used crypto.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:27:20
Do they have any valid reasons to do so?
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:17:07
Have you tried it? What about drivers?
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:26:37
What stops me from disassembling the device and playing with clock, fault injection and other glitching? It's much easier to do on your device than on smart card, at least from equipment perspective. Smart cards also tend to have built in protection from clock and voltage glitching, which makes it even harder.

Old, wiped, Android phone with imei set to 0, random ID string and mac addr. Public wifi at said shopping mall.

Read up on smart card reverse engineering. It's not as easy as it sounds.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:40:59
Maybe that's just me, but I'd rather have an implementation on proven platform used for critical secure operations, than on general purpose microcontroller.  
Besides, your trust still lies on only a handful users, who vouch for this code security (and may or may not be right). On the other hand you have huge corporations, which multi billion business depends on smart card security.

huh, I was under impression the documentation for HW.1 cannot be made public due to smartcard technology restrictions.  
Anyway, thanks for the comparison! It seems like HW.1 is sufficient for my long term cold storage needs.
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:02:47
I'd like to ask a similar question - what about HW.1 and Ledger comparison?
As far as I know, it's from the same team.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:59:18
Yes, that is a valid point, but in my opinion it still boils down to who do you believe more; Semi-anonymous people on internet, or a company specialized in this sort of thing.
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:30:59
Is that ga-bitbot?
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:56:08
Yeah, they shot themselves in the foot by going with 60nm process
@_date: 2013-05-09 10:03:20
You just may have a better piece of silicon. Not every piece is flawless - bigger manufacturers get away with it by selling chips with flaws underclocked, but BFL cannot afford that.

Last time I heard about DHS in btc community was a guy getting jailed over drugs and money laundering...
