Totally agree that cashflow is what makes the difference.
The real question is, how do we create wealth in the crypto space? Ie dividends, income, securities that produce "coinflow" ?

Most users, most decentralized network, longest legacy blockchain

Congratulations. HODL to the moon. 
Best advice is to be like Buffet/Graham and assume you can't sell it for 5 years. Check back in when you are ready to cash out for your lambo.

Awesome super insightful video thank you.
The fact that these will be cash settled futures gives me comfort.

Move it to a secure wallet that isn't controlled by a centralized entity such as coinbase.

I agree with the spirit of OP's post. 
More markets will mean more awareness will mean more adoption. The technology is the point. 
The coins are deflationary and they are the legacy firstmover. Lightning is coming. HODL

While certain nodes may have outweighted importance, Bitcoin is definitely NOT centralized.

Thank you for that link!

Yes, that's correct, but it's also not really the point. 
I don't meant to say that we have a floor of $10,000. About a week before the $10,000 threshold, for example, the 1,000,000 JPY barrier was broken. Also not a floor.
The point is, there is a lot of global demand at this point. And a lot of people sitting on the sidelines hoping for a dip so they can buy in and become hodlers.

Qaddafi is just one of many examples.
The good news is, we have the tide of technological innovation on our side. As the world "globalizes" a decentralized structure for storing purchasing power that is agnostic to political borders will only continue to make more sense, especially in the minds of those with private jets.

A lot of them are going to have less profit on their long positions with the small selloff today, so they will have less incentive to dump

"Double dipping".
The thing that's good to remember is, bitcoin is traded GLOBALLY. And in Japan when that price starts to drop, they are going to buy. In Korea, India, Venezuela, etc. They are going to buy. At this point the emotional barrier of $10,000 BTC has been shattered. Any cocky traders on wall street are going to need to think hard about whether they want to try to treat this thing like a penny stock. It isn't one.

Shorting BTC means: 
Borrowing the BTC from the exchange/broker at it's current market price, immediately selling it, then buying more BTC later to return the borrowed amount of BTC to the the exchange/broker. If the price goes down, a short position makes money on the differenced.
 
The reason shorting in and of itself does not necessarily force the price down is because for each BTC being sold at the start of a short, there is a corresponding necessary purchase on the other end of the short, so supply and demand theoretically balance (though there is a time delay and enough short positions do add up). 
HOWEVER, as stated above, if enough traders open short positions and then begin selling BTC (which WOULD actually force the price down by creating excess supply) then shorters could make a lot of money. This would be called a "Bear Raid".
Skylark is right that shorting is highly risking. Typically shorts are leveraged, and they carry uncapped risk -- you can lose more than the amount you invested into the short position if the price goes up and you are stuck short. If you hang onto a bad short position for too long, you could get a margin call and end up bankrupt. And, historically, asset prices have generally gone up over time so you are betting against the trend.
 
That said, one concern is the idea that the price run up we've seen recently has come from institutional investors buying BTC. These same buyer could eventually participate in a bear raid once the options/futures market opens. It also makes me extremely nervous that the US government is one of the largest owners of BTC after silk road was shut down, etc. The US is threatened by BTC. 
If the hodlers just keep hodling, maybe even double down and place some small buy orders -- even tiny buy orders from the masses would make a difference. Some wall street traders will also be buying long futures and will not want to see the price fall out. Hopefully no bear raid.
