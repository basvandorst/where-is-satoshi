You know, for a guy who seems smart, he sounds incredibly dumb. But what do you expect?

I don't know if this is a fake tweet or not. It was posted on litecoinnews

The value rising would lead to more volume and that would in turn lead to reduced volatility because it would take more and more money to move the market in any significant way.

That would mean they would cease their 1 euro=1 dollar policy.
Fat chance at that happening.

I'm 25 and have been around in the bitcoin community since 2012. 
Posts like the one you just made actually gives me little hope something like bitcoin will ever succeed. Too many greedy pigs just looking to make a profit. Am I the only one who wants this to succeed as a currency or at least stable store of value?

Does that actually mean something? I mean, if someone were to cash out on all exchanges simultaneously he would probably only get 50mil. So that 10 billion market cap is bullshit.

more like 16 million if they dumped them all at once
i pulled that number out of my ass

Could also be that the guy donated to himself in order to generate publicity.

Well if everyone stopped selling them, and just held on to their bitcoins, value would rise exponentially. In turn volatility would go down and more merchants would start accepting it as a form of payment.
