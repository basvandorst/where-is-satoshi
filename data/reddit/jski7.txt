Oh yep I see it. I apologize.

Yeah true, but it's not so much for the money as it is to get people started in the cryptocurrency community. As I said this is not the best approach to earning bitcoin, just one of them.

Yes, please read the main text. Look for the big bold letters that read full disclosure.

I can only hope. I will have so many mid size Buicks, I will be drowning in mediocre vehicles.
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:18:39
yeah, sorry man. Just saw that, taking everything down now.

Awesome, I still have a bunch of Mt. Baker Juice in my personal collection. They are getting old though so I guess I'll have to order some more. Thanks for accepting Bitcoin, it really helps give me incentive to purchase your products!

Tipsy Tuesdays? Sounds like my kind of day. Thanks for being awesome.

Coinbase offers users the ability to have a regular wallet, a "BTC Vault" which was created as sort of a savings account, and a USD (possibly other fiat currencies as well) wallet. They could possibly be counting all of these as seperate wallets. That would account for the differences in wallets and users. 
Edit: the fiat wallet is for what they call "instant trading", so you have fiat to trade for BTC on hand rather than waiting for the bank.

Honestly I think it's a little expensive for one random book. I think it would be better as a subscription service, like maybe two books a month for $5 or BTC equivilent. But then again i'm sort of a frugal person, so take that with a grain of salt. I will say that I love the simplicity of the site, it looks very sleek. And also the jokes in between text is a nice touch. I might just have to try one of these books from your basement... I mean library.

I enjoy reading CCN most of the time. I'm not sure how reliable they are but I usually take all news with a grain of salt, especially news surrounding cryptocurrencies. Could there possibly ever be a desktop widget or widget for android in the works? I would thoroughly enjoy that. Looks really good though, I like it.

I am super impressed with how quickly you can implement change upon receiving feedback! It's pretty amazing. Also I just reviewed some of the information on the altquick service and it seems awesome. Great job!

like Keanu Reeves?

Cryptsy required me to submit a scanned copy of my ID along with a picture of my self holding my ID, and a piece of paper with my username, the word cryptsy, and the current date in order to begin trading. I haven't done any coin to coin with bittrex yet, but so far they haven't required me to submit anything similar to what cryptsy made me submit. 
Edit: this is apparently only if you want to trade in USD. My mistake.

Yup, this is what I do. Keep in mind though that deposits into your fiat wallet still take around seven days to post. So either make replenishing the fiat wallet a habit or always know how much BTC you are going to buy at least a week ahead of time.

An android application for the quickbuy/sell features for those of us that don't constantly have access to our desktops. Also I second text message notifications for holds/deposits, especially if the android app is not feasible.

This [chart]( claims to represent internet adoption from 1995-2011 but I'm not sure how accurate it is. Hope this helps, if so I can try to find similar adoption charts for other technologies.
edit: Just realized it says American adults specifically so it's not very representative of full adoption.

That's a good point. I forgot shipping charges can be rather high for sellers. Anyways it's a super cool idea for people who are indecisive about which book to pick up next. I've got a couple of people who read constantly who I'll send to your site, who knows maybe they will like what they see as well. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:08:21
Awesome! I am really excited for the prospect of your mobile apps. The mobile friendly websites are an improvement but all of them run a bit clunky in my opinion, I do really enjoy the sites UI in general though. Oh and thank you!
