Spamming the block chain is like putting graffiti, on one of the wonders of the world
It should be considered by this community a criminal act, even if it is not in the nation that it originates

Solid is all about permissionless development.  The same as the web.  You dont have to ask anyone's permission to create an idea.
So solid itself can never be KYC compliant.  But some businesses may choose to make a solid app of that kind.
Have followed self sovereign for a while and we like it!  But it means a few things now, and I'm not sure I know all of them.  But Chris Allen's ideas and that of the did: specification, we want to work with.  And also content addressable URIs such as IPFS.  But they will be parts of a larger whole.

To explain a bit further, every system should do one thing well.
For btc that is a secure settlement layer without central points of failure.
For the web / solid that is ease of distribution to a wide audience, and the ability to create distributed apps (dapps).  It also has extremely large bandwidth and storage, which can grow without hitting scalability walls.
Each system lacks some of the features of the other, but with tied together give the best of all worlds.
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:13:17
Solid is compatible with ipfs and complementary.  Dont worry, there is work under way to integrate btc! ;)
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:33:50
Solid developer here.  
There are plans to integrate both btc and lightning network into the semantic web layer of solid.
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:59:32
Unsure if I understand the question, but my guess is complementary.  Solid is a layer above, with different costs and benefits.

402 -- Payment Required.  I actually asked Tim about this.  
His reply was, "we obviously thought it was important at the time, otherwise we would not have put it before 404 as an error code" :)

Make sure you try compressed and uncompressed keys.  No need for a reward, if this works.  Give it to a charity of your choice.

It does not matter too much whether or not the fork goes ahead, if no one is going to mine it.

Shouldnt it add up to 100%? :)
BTC is sound.
ETH is good for ICOs but possibly has structural problems.  Id be neutral there.
Ripple I would not hold.  Can you construct the ledger from the blocks?  No, didnt think so.  Investing in a ledger technology where some of the ledger is missing, seems to me a sign of insanity.
I'd look at some smaller innovative alts.  Ask yourself how is the best way to secure a block chain in the long term, then look at alts that are solving this problem.
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:51:51
Exactly.  It's not contentious at all.  As bitcoin grows it has pain points.  And with pain points come politics.  Most communities with politics become polarized.  Being polarized over something with so little contention is really quite a nice problem to have.  It shows that there is a very high bar for change, and that is desirable.
Any of the proposed solutions including keeping things the same would be quite OK.  That's how robust bitcoin is.  Any of the solutions NOT being adopted will have a vocal minority that feels their concerns have not been addressed.  
There is every evidence that Satoshi viewed this as either trivial or a non-issue.

It will trade at about 15% of BTC, other forks have fallen after open, and it may pump at open
This means it will need subsidies to continue.  When the subsidies run out the chain will be orphaned and worthless.
It might limp along for quite a while, but it will be expensive.
