Awesome, thanks again! :-) 
Will definitely do a little more research on them, it's good to know the strengths and weaknesses of the other players out there. Like you, I love the feature of bank transfers with my CBA account. I've been using this feature for a few months now and no issues until this point.
My concern now with iGot is that if I do have a problem, looking to them for support and a prompt response is out of the question.
It's a shame, up until now I would have only said positive things. 
I'm happy to pay extra for premium customer service, which is what you'd expect when dealing with financial institutions you in trust to manage your funds.

Hey mate,
Thanks so much for the feedback! Have just created a CoinJar account. I will let you know how it goes.

Also, CleverEmu how long did it take for them to respond to your inquiries? How did you contact them, was it thru their support page and raising a ticket?
I raised a ticket days ago, sent them an email and PM'd  .. and nothing..

Thanks again for your support and advice, as of this morning I have provided them with the documentation so I hope this is resolved quickly! I don't want to continue to hang them out to dry on Reddit just to get them to pay attention. I hope they're proactive.
Would you recommend CoinJar over iGot for Aussies? 
How is there transaction times for bank deposits and withdrawals? 
Do they offer good support?
Cheers, CleverEmu

Hi mate, thanks again for your response!
You wont believe it, I have literally just received communication from iGot - they're happy to deposit the funds into my account so I can purchase BTC at the current rate, however have blocked me from withdrawing until I provide ID documents of the person that deposited on my behalf.
This is fair, and reasonable and all I wanted from the start!
As I mentioned before, it's unfortunate that you have to make noise in forums and go to great lengths to get in contact with them!
However, the ball is rolling - I'll keep you updated. 
Thanks again for the support.

It's actually nearly been 5 days (which I should have edited) , we're taking about a large sum of money and these people commit to a 24hr response to your inquiry and a max of 3 days to receive a deposit. Both of these commitments have not been honored

Thanks for your comments! I get it, they must have an issue with the way the funds were deposited. I haven't had an issue with them like this before.
I just want to be responded to/contacted so it can be resolved.
If my account's in review or I've been flagged, they should notify me as soon as they've deemed an issue with my account.
There's nothing fraudulent about the transaction and that can be verified.
They just need to pull they're fingers out and be proactive in resolving the matter. 
It appears that 'customer experience' is not at the top of their priory list when it comes to running a business.

All this is understood now Rick, however what you and your team CLEARLY keep FAILING to see is that the LACK OF COMMUNICATION and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE is what's to blame here.. Not your policies and processes!
As I've mentioned time and time again, had I been contacted and the FOUR points outlined by you above (which didn't seem to hard for you to do) been proactively explained to me, this post would not even exist!!!!
Your website is asking for its customers to complete a survey around their customer experience and how YOU can make it better for US..
**Start listening to the feedback and action on it!!!**
If you're still unable to understand what we are asking (I say "we" because if you look thru the forum results for iGot.com everyone thinks your service is shit and most people think you've been uncovered as a scam!).
**How to fix your issues:**
1. Contact customers proactively when there is an issue
2. Let them know what is required from them to resolve the issue proactively (instead of waiting 48+ hours to respond to your customers query) 
3. Address the questions asked in your customers query, so they don't have to ask again, and again, and again - whilst waiting 24+ hours each time to get a response that still avoids certain questions to the initial comment
4. Respond to your customers FASTER (24+ hours is not acceptable when depositing large funds, especially when there is an issue with these types of transactions), raise priority cases for customers so they receive faster responses and are therefore actually made to feel like their situation is important to iGot
5. Stop using compliance as an excuse for poor customer service
**Conclusion: Contact your customers, instead of waiting for them to contact you. Explain the situation thoroughly by providing ETAs and documents required to resolve issue (if these ETA's can't be met, be proactive and contact your customer again explaining this). Respond to your customers that are in these unique situations FASTER by prioritising them.**
**Follow these steps in the future Rick and team iGot and you will have more satisfied customers.**

Too true! Thanks mate

Valid, and in hindsight I agree that it probably wasn't the best way to have funds deposited.
Maybe I was naive, however I'm used to banking/trading funds between bank accounts and different individuals all the time. 
Requesting people to deposit money into my Australian bank account as a method of reimbursement or payment is a normality.
I didn't foresee it being a problem in this situation!?
Having said that, I'm happy to provide evidence to prove the transaction is agreed upon with all parties involved.
However, I'm unable to do that when my attempts to contact the organization through their "support" structure has yet to be successful in terms of receiving a response from them.
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:49:21
They have been flagged consistently (I've just come to understand) for their poor communication, extremely long wait times for deposits and withdrawals and for ignoring their customers until it suits them. 
I have seen that the outcome for most individuals is positive, however creating a stir and being loud about the problem is essential for a "faster" response!! 
Therefore, I'm here! And not going away until this rude and incompetent "business" resolve my issue.
Respond to your customers!!!
