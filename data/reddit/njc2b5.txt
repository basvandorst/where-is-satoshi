They have stated with their policy they will not switch if they believe its contentious.  I for one agree with you and think in the end they'll say "oh well", or else they'll lose a lot of relevance.  However, there current policy is anything but this.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:28:07
I would call what they are doing bullying, seeing as they are threatening all wallet providers if they move there systems over to it.  Claiming something is contentious but not defining what that means because its too hard.
They are apart of the market, but barely.  Their importance is overstated by a lot, and they will become irrelevant if a hard for prevails and they ignore it for too long.

This is true, but the war has already been going on...  What I'm seeing on my end now is alternatives (soft fork) being proposed and BIPed, and a hard fork that was originally 20MB going down to 8MB and making other changes to reach greater consensus.
It may appear like a full front war still, but both sides are trying to find solution, while keeping there foot down as much as possible.  I think this has greater possibility than say 2 weeks ago to end in a higher consensus solution, thats all I'm saying, things are still moving in a war so to speak, but they are beginning to at least move in a better direction.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:06:05
This is a 10 day old interview, and in bitcoin thats a very long time.  We've had a soft fork BIP proposed and 20MB brought down to 8MB in this time.  Gavin has already made his intentions clear it would be a hard fork in this time, and Mikes own language has now focused on the hard fork.
Honestly, I question the motives to bring this back up at this point as it appears at least some progress is being made, although minor.  It feels very divisive and timed.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:41:06
I don't believe he was speaking about Gavin/Mike, but both sides.  He's saying that sides are trying to win by diving people.  Unfortunately, if he's right, the people claiming to be protecting the blockchain (on both sides) will do more harm to it through their tactics.  Luckily the blockchain has survived far worse than this, so I'm not too worried.

Thanks, wasn't aware of this.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:51:58
It can't get ACKed until there is a BIP.  Gavin is working on it, other solutions are being worked on as well... It seems the direction overall is heading in the right path, we may have a high consensus fork (soft or hard) yet.

They may never charge a fee, the 1% may be there just incase they need to do it at some point.  Theoretically, if they are centrally holding large amounts of BTC, most of it will go unused on most days, and they can leverage it to make interest and pay for the service that way.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:15:37
I believe its ASIC resistant.  All it means is ASIC miners are not as effective mining Litecoin as they are at Bitcoin.  Its a small detail in the end if you ask me, not a great feature.
The big Litecoin selling points are... a) first real alt coin on market, b) 2.5 minute block times instead of 10, c) lower transaction fees in long term.
Basically point A and its largest alt coin market cap drive LTC speculation the most.  They are very far behind BTC in both consumer, corporate and developer adoption.  The problems they solve with B which ultimately leads to lower fees is likely not very great either, since consumers expect a very quick transaction time and this can be done through several various solutions using BTC, or done on-chain through other alt coin networks that are not as big today but could grow.
Bottom line, BTC is leading the way, but its possible alt coins may play a large role in the future.  Even more possible though, is speculation on alt coins will play a large role for the next market wave, so while BTC will climb, some alt coins will likely outperform BTC.  Again I'm sticking with BTC at the moment to avoid the added risk to an already risky investment, but thats the reality as I see it. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:07:29
No, Bitcoin could just be hard-forked even if it were 51% attacked successfully, which is incredibly unlikely at this point anyways.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:48:33
You can't split them reliably, only make an estimate, so I doubt they are doing this.  I doubt they were experiencing a 300% growth though recently and this is largely due to Greece/Euro situation..  Hence the reason they dropped fees, they want to get as much sweat from this as possible while its hot.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:46:05

Ha, yep, this user is pretty transparent here. Pumping something right before the dump.  Up 411% in 30 days, that should say all any reasonable investor needs to know.  What goes up, must come down.
FYI, not speaking bad of Bitshares X here, don't know enough about it, but this rise is not related to anything else in crypto, so it is 99.9% likely a bad pump that will end with a lot of people losing a lot of money.

Not only that but couldn't we all come up with a list of shortcomings for Bitcoin right now as well?  If every idea was only successful if it had no shortcomings, no ideas would ever be successful.
I think its smarter to have a wait and see approach.
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:02:05
If we are talking about 30% of the 2% grabbed by the card holding company, that would be about .6%.  I get the joke, but it might not be far off....
Odds are it is lower than that, but its somewhere in that ballpark probably.
Again not a substantial amount of Apple's revenue though, even when its crazy successful, unless they knock out middle men over time and capture the full 2+%.

Its down 2:1 from Bitcoin, but you have to keep in mind they are dealing with the move to ASIC mining at the moment, and because its an alt with little retail adoption it is even more speculative than Bitcoin.
I have a hunch LTC gains will be stronger than BTC as a % investment though on the next rise.  Even with that hunch, I'm sticking with BTC right now because for LTC to rise I believe BTC has to rise, and LTCs rise with BTC is not a guaranteed outcome.

That doesn't make sense though unless they can recur bill you.  Its so difficult to get a customer to pay, even for a month, that they would only be interested in recurring billing to get most of their revenue.
Same with many micro-payments.  Micro payments is a great idea (say to hear a song one, or for the day, or download the song completely)... but unless they can have it extract from your account in one click (similar to Apple App Store) it will be a conversion killer and not generate as much revenue as focusing on a stream that does.
This is all coming....  it's just not here yet.  That is what will make micro-payments really work though.
Closest thing I've seen so far is Coinbase tip button.  This requires you to be a Coinbase customer though.

They wouldn't store the asset on the Bitcoin network, but they could store the key to the lock.  The asset itself though would in most cases be too costly to store.

This was the easiest win.  Now the tough win comes, making sure BitLicense doesn't completely eliminate NY from the map for Bitcoin companies and enthusiasts, and sending a clear message to the rest of the country that this is an overreach.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:58:05
So what they're basically saying is Bitcoin doesn't need more regulation, because they're already able to capture the "bad guys".  So why enforce more crap on the good guys?
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:13:01
From the gut, were do you see things going in a year?
I'm not entirely sure.  There is the great possibility of increased consumer and corporate adoption, deflation of $ reversing, new innovations, ETF, etc...
On the flip side, we have a ton of Bitcoin companies that have received a lot of financing from investors and will be burning a hole through that money and needing more.  We may very well have an Internet 2.0 crash in terms of money drying up and only the strongest companies surviving before investors open the wallets again and a new set of stronger companies arise.  Or the money could keep flowing...  Investment $'s is something I'm planning to watch closely, because the amount coming right now is a bit crazy considering the current value of bitcoin itself.
An example of the second paragraph dilema I'm having is Coinbase.  Originally they were rumored to be raising 100 million, then it dropped significantly with diminished interest, and we still haven't heard if they've closed a new round.  This is one of the strongest Bitcoin related companies, but they may have gone too big too fast.  In other cases companies with weak performance may find it tougher to get funded.
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:05:35
SPAM is not a way to get more companies to accept bitcoin. Best method is to ask everyone while they do business transactions to ask the person they are purchasing from if they accept Bitcoins.  Organic requests will carry more weight.

Yeah if its stored off the blockchain that would be completely different.  At that point, yes, its a speed of light type situation but also centralized.  That will be a scenario I think some assets will have, and the blockchain will be used as an audit-able ledger.

Yes it has, and I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:40:16
This is where my post was headed.  I doubt a year turn-around, Apple is slower than most big tech.  They're not usually first, but they are sometimes the first to get it right.  Another reason it will take longer is that Apple is so big, for them to move the needle in revenue adding Bitcoin, they will need the consumer demand.
Bitcoin is just another payment option.  The difference is, Apple can continue to charge retailers high fees, and collect even more from each payment made.  So in that sense, Bitcoin would be very attractive to them long term so long as the consumer demand is there.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:22:28
Look at it this way, Microsoft is accepting bitcoin, but they are having you put funds in an account to then purchase items very easily.  In other words, yes you could put a small amount in each time, but it would create a lot of hassle.  Its much easier to put in a fraction of a bitcoin and use it over several downloads.
In order to get to true micropayment success, a decentralized method to do what they are doing is needed.  Basically a fund account users are "a-ok" with giving easy access to for trusted retailers (maybe similar to signing in to give your Facebook details to a site).  Once that occurs it should be a simple one click option.

Great move to make the comments all public.  Hopefully regs won't be awful, but I'm not holding my breath.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:58:16
Yep and if I had to guess the cut they get all depends on a host of rules.  In other words Apple doesn't have a specific cut per transaction to easily announce.
When you take a large number of payments this is very common.  Credit card payments are incredibly complicated.
Also, FYI, fees for Apple do not matter.  They are not doing this (upfront, at least) for revenue, but as a feature lock-in to their eco-system.  Payments, except for being the big guys, is not a big money game, and other news outlets have already shown this won't add more than 3-5% to Apple's revenue if most Apple users use it all the time.
Where it could become very profitable though is if Apple were to say, cut out a middleman.  In that case they'd go from making probably somewhere between .25-.5% and make more around 2% on average.  That would jump their revenue to about 12-20%, and would be substantial...
So, what technology could Apple add in the background eventually, that would allow them to cut out a middle man, and be as secure or more secure than the current networks... hmmm... :)

Transactions is looking better, price looks bad, Google Trends... why?  This is not that valuable of a measurement piece, especially considering the bigger Bitcoin companies get the more people will search brands first.
So much missing here is missing when looking at growth in 2014 though, including....
* Wallet adoption and growth (looking good)
* Investment growth, highlighted by Coindesk today. (looking great, maybe worry some that its growing too fast, as investment dollars could dry up for future rounds, like it did for early Internet companies)
* Corporate testing (MSFT) and corporate acceptance (DISH, etc). (looking great)
* Regulation clarity (mixed, positive in some countries, negative in others)
* Improvement on the ease in which it takes to learn and use Bitcoin (looking good)

This and Coinbase is rumored to be raising around $100 million from a company in the financial sector that does not have an investment wing.  Very likely Paypal has made an investment in Coinbase as well, and this has not been announced yet, but will be shortly.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:18:34
Instant commission is interesting, but the problem with it, particularly when you are given 35% of a sale, is what happens when a refund occurs?  If you already have 35%, the employer now has to go back to you to get those funds, or withhold funds in the future.  I don't see "instant pay" becoming a big trend very soon for reasons like this. 
Card fee savings is real for business owner at least in short term if Bitcoin caught on.
Escrow for hair cuts will likely never happen.  If customers can go somewhere else to pay after the service is completed, rather than be distrusted upfront, they'll go somewhere else.  In the end, customer service is more important here than what at first glance may appear to be in the businesses best interest.

Worst logic ever.


The Internet is fractured too.  I guess it won't survive.


Most of the world has no clue what Bitcoin is.  Governments are creating policy around it more often than banning it, so they are giving approval.  UK Finance minister has said he wants the area to be FinTech capital of the world.  Most warning about Bitcoin are similar to same warnings governments gave about early world wide web.


Oh no, disagreement.

Not today, but when they do they will likely be able to view your history pretty well, particularly if you transfer your USD to BTC from your bank account or credit/debit card.
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:27:32
Also keep in mind if a bitcoin became worth $50k, that would mean transferring anything with a 10k satoshi miner fee would cost $5.  That would make it incredibly expensive to transfer certain types of asset keys that wouldn't be worth that value.
I think Bitcoin will have some asset and asset key management, but I would expect either an alt-coin or side-chain to become a standard here, because the costs and time to confirmation need to be lowered significantly, and some assets don't require as much security as moving money itself.

@_date: 2015-01-21 22:41:15
Want to add one additional note here, I know I said Bruce had an agenda.  We all have an agenda.  Even Coinfire and every other news site.  Thats why its so important news site in-particular fight every urge of an agenda to report the news as best and professionally as possible.  Its very difficult to do.
I just wanted to be clear here, as agenda was not meant to be a negative connotation, simply a reference to how an individual will and can have these views, but its very important a news agency fight against this natural urge.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:38:00
I do think needs to chill a little.  Yes they are breaking news, and yes they are getting some wild complaints and even occasional threats on their side... but acting professional will boost their trust and long term standing as well.
A better way for them to have responded was "We are just reporting the facts as we get them and believe them to be news worthy."  Instead they asked a question that implied Bruce may want them to stop reporting messages he doesn't like.  In some ways, Bruce's comments lead this belief, but a professional response was still a better response than the leading question, and as it turned out from Bruce's response, he wanted nothing of the sort anyhow.
There should be a difference here.  At the end of the day, Bruce Fenton clearly has an agenda here as he has outright called GAW a "scam".  Coinfire, to remain a  trusted and legitimate news agency needs to avoid having an agenda as much as possible (a very difficult task to do), and avoid looking defensive when a simpler statement would have sufficed.
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:02:57

With a statement like the one you've just made, its no wonder you have trouble keeping your "talent" professional.  
When you start this biased, and are trying to predict the future... you don't report news, you write gossip.
Thats the Coinfire difference, their writers can't have holdings in any crypto-currency, and all tips have to be converted quickly to fiat.  They don't take a stake, and don't try to predict the future.  They try to report the news, as accurately as possible.  They've built a strong reputation as well over time, hence the reason so many here believe them and their latest article.

@_date: 2015-01-12 21:30:28
Ah makes sense.
Yeah I think the first issue could be solved simply by using the decentralized system for hosting, and a centralized system for the domain.  For most groups this would be fine.  For outlier organizations, companies, people who would be silenced, the cost of their content might mean users would likely have to find them by the specific address and losing the private key would mean their users would have to re-find them.
The second problem I'm still not sure on.  In any decentralized system there is still the possibility of a 50% attack so to speak, correct?  If a system became mainstream over time, its likely the software would be built into browsers controlled by large companies, and so the system could be compromised.  I don't know, predicting the future is impossible, so I'm probably a little crazy here in my thought process.
Way to go though, this is very cool.  I'm planning on checking it out later this evening when I have more free time to try it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:10:01

Anyone can, I don't disagree.  My point is I'm fearful most won't.
Bitpay is huge right now, but I'm a little concerned they are headed in a bad direction.  There were the recent layoffs, and unlike Coinbase, they don't have as clear a business model right now.  Bitpay would be a great competitor though if they can make it work.  Thats exactly my hope, more competition.  Hopefully Circle can gain as well, and others.  Right now though, I'm starting to get concerned.

Great point.  
I think they will offer this, but lets say they offer a "send" button and it makes it incredibly easy for you to send bitcoin through them, but tougher if you use another service.  Similar to their current tip button.  Thats where it could be a huge problem.  
I guess the question is if they become big enough, would a Facebook or other big service for instance be forced to use their send button, versus creating their own.  If they can still create their own, then I think your very right, we are still in good shape.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:46:45
Makes sense, and I agree with the overall thought.  
I was just trying to say with the timing of the comment after the CoinFire just broke the story, its very easy to assume you may have been referring to them as well.
Your thoughts are always welcome Bruce.  I don't always agree with you (wasn't big on your feelings towards NY Regs and how to proceed on them), but you are clearly putting forth a well thought out argument and doing your best to push crypto forward, so for that and all the time you put in, you have my respect.

Best line ever :)  I don't follow everything Bruce says, but from what I have seen I have not seen him defend GAW, and certainly was not here.  If anything, he was asking the focus remain on it being a scam, and not muddy the waters of the message with other items.
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:46:24
I'm not sure how this is honestly good news.  My concern here is that Coinbase is "Everything".   Right now they are to Bitcoin what AOL was to the Internet early on.  Thats fine if it eventually breaks apart, but some of these services aren't easy to break apart.
In AOL's case they were the Internet provider and content provider, but content could be better provided by the entire web, so they failed.
In Coinbase's case they are the bank, the exchange, and the payment processor to name a few.  Someone could move their BTC out of Coinbase fairly easily, but what value will they get for doing so?  If payment processors use them, they can make it super simple for their customers and tough for everyone else (look at their tipping tool).  It becomes more difficult to leave them then, both for the customers of the bank who will say leaving Coinbase means its tougher to make a payment, and those in the payment processor, who knows Coinbase will have millions of customers.  The exchange is similar.  If they get the liquidity, which they probably already have a ton of through buying and selling online, than it become more difficult to use an exchange with less liquidity.
This is all great for Coinbase, but if it can't be separated long term by innovation because the stickiness factor is too great, than this is a real problem for crypto-currency and innovation in the field.  Unlike AOL, right now if Coinbase keeps steamrolling, I'm not sure how this engine is stopped.

I was hoping to see more comments than anonymous downvotes, as I really was wanting to understand this topic a little better and different solid counterpoints.  I think gave some great points.  I hope those down-voting understand I have nothing against Coinbase today, I'm just worried about the future and keeping the pace of innovation.  I like Coinbase, and I've used Coinbase's services, so this is nothing against what they've achieved today, just a concern for what might happen tomorrow.
**update two** Wow, thank you for the reddit gold gift!  I really appreciate it, and appreciate the community supporting the discussion in the end.  Onward :)

They are a worldwide company and growing.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:04:54
Could be, they are probably a bit away from the next round of funding though.  More likely to be BitPay I think, or ETF getting approved and investors coming in this way.

I'm not sure that would work quite yet, unless Coinbase supports subscription payments.  Github is a subscription service.  I could see it working for AirBnb, Uber, etc.

Just to add, the largest problem with censorship may end up not being sites getting banned, but by search engines hiding the sites from public view.
I think another interesting project would be a decentralized search engine.

Thank you for the comment.
I guess I kind of always though of AOL, Compuserve, etc as an Internet "on-ramp" for many as well, thats where I was drawing the comparison.  
I agree their relevance evaporated, and it was largely due to the free version of the content product (World Wide Web) being better than theirs Their software).  It was also honestly because they got increased competition from high-speed services.
I'm hoping this is the same for bitcoin, at least in the way of a lot of healthy competition for years to come.

I think they are the original news source, and maybe only big news source to report it right now.  I think it was a fair association CoinFire made here, I thought you were talking about them, but also generalizing.

I don't mistaken it all all.  What I'm saying is just like the Internet, Bitcoin is known to be both awesome and imperfect.  The imperfect part is where businesses come in, the problem is if one company solves the problems better than anyone else first and gains a large market share, they have the ability to create a stickiness that is tough to leave.
Think about banks for a second and how much everyone hates them.  Theres been a lot of people who've tried to create friendly banks, and they don't succeed at the same level or fail.  The problem is as much of a pain point as it is, its difficult to leave, so a lot of consumers don't.
Same with YouTube.  They own video, they've cut deals with large Internet Providers to make their videos load faster than its possible to without the deals, etc... Video is not owned by YouTube, but its difficult for new incumbents to challenge the space.
What I'm saying is we have a real goliath in the making here, but unlike the early Internet, its less likely to be disrupted downstream as they become less friendly, because the services they provide and link-up will be more sticky.

This should be on the front page for a couple weeks as far as I'm concerned.  Thank you for clarifying the issue.  This is no longer a possible scam, this looks very much like someone that is cheating others and getting away with it.

I love the idea of a decentralized web but it has a couple flaws...
* If the private key is compromised the site is lost forever.
* Bitcoin is not truly decentralized.  Since there are large mining groups, wouldn't it be possible for countries to eventually pact together to reject certain keys and force it upon the mining groups?
The first issue, private keys being compromised is a big deal.  For this to work on a grand scale and be the "next" web, there would have to be a way to reclaim ownership.  Today, thats done through a centralized authority using domains.  I'm wondering, how would this look in a decentralized system long term?  Obviously, not a problem that would have to be solved today, but a problem none the less.
The second issue, could also be a real problem in the future.  Big companies today already facilitate government requests, so whats to stop big mining companies from doing the same long term?  How does this get prevented?
Again love the idea, this is very very cool.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:44:52
So far they haven't disappointed, and they are saying at least 30 countries... which leads me to believe they think they'll hit this goal pretty easily.

I don't think we are in phase 4 definitively yet.  The Coinbase news is great, but we have not seen a big rise in price, or continued wall-street adoption.
Right now, its just one company, and it happens to be the biggest Bitcoin company of them all, which is great news.  Lets hope the trend continues, the price follows, and the phases are correct.

They didn't want Andreas or they would have invited him to be the keynote speaker.  The presentation looks great to me, but I'm not the Money 2020 crowd.  I would think this would not be the best presentation for that group.  I think the lesson here, is its highly likely they'll learn from the presentation and do a better job the next time.  Most people fail at something before they are great at it.  Lets not pretend though that some other group would have been given the keynote slot, there is a reason why they were chosen.
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:13:54
I don't think thats the case at all.
What it shows is how two different leaders in the space think.  Brian's argument was largely that the Core team was too demanding of perfect, and the pursuit of this would drive developers away from Bitcoin, and keep Bitcoin from innovating quickly enough.
He has a large reason to believe this.  His company Coinbase is run literally the opposite way, and it is by and large the most successful crypto-currency bank to-date.  He's done this by moving quickly, and not stressing on perfect.
Stephen's argument was more one of caution.  Lets hear everyone out.  I don't believe he stressed perfect here, but he was arguing less from an innovation standpoint, and more from a technical lets do this right standpoint.  He has clearly been a leader himself in the space.  One could argue Bitpay has been having its problems (largely being in the payment space, when its not growing fast enough), but his company has certainly been technology leaders in many cases, and his response indicates as to why this is the case.
In the end I didn't see more adult or less adult here, I saw two very successful people explaining their rationale in a way that defines why they themselves are successful.
Both concerns are actually somewhat valid, its a problem with a debate like this, it can go on forever because neither side is completely right.  Brian is correct, we need to keep Bitcoin agile enough to grow and innovate.  Stephen is correct, that we need to make sure we are making the right steps forward, and hearing all voices in the process.
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:20:29
this does feel like big news.  I know it won't reflect in the price, but this is the best performing Bitcoin company to date making a major, major expansion.
I expect we'll hear about the new round of funds soon as well, that explains the capital raise.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:23:00
Regardless its a well written post to try and show examples of bitcoin usage in an everyday very common business.
Whether fake or real, comments like "No female hairdresser" to argue merits is irrelevant.  If  anything, it feels sexist.  No need to upvote the poster or tip if you feel its fake, but we don't need to shame females or hairdressers for that matter.

While I get what he's trying to say, his first point "assuming Amazon.com pays a 3% transaction fee" is crazy.  Big companies don't pay a 3% transaction fee.  Most large companies pay more in the 2-2.25% range, and Amazon is so big, they would not be going through a middle man credit card merchant, so there rates would be even lower.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are at or under 1.5%.
Not saying if everyone used Bitcoin it wouldn't be a benefit to Amazon to accept it, just saying there are many considerations to all if this, including lower fees and conversion rates.  The true savings comes after all of this, but right now his first calculation is off by about half or more I'd suspect.
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:27:10
I have quite a bit of respect for you in saying this.  While I don't think anything is conclusive yet, I would like to ask you to please work towards helping to bridge the gap in core developers.  I think there is still room for compromise here, it's just going to require some leaders in the middle to step up for the community.
If the will of so many are ignored from either group a split will likely happen, but if agreement can be reached, only a small vocal minority from both sides will feel jilted.

Would be huge if he did 0 day trading with all current stocks for customer accounts, and used the blockchain to decipher ownership.  If that were the case, he would only need to have liquidity to allow trading like this for customers while other institutions take their 3 day period to settle the trades they already know are getting processed. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:21:53
The problem is you couldn't buy -&gt; sell -&gt; buy -&gt; sell -&gt; buy in a single day.  While stock trades are electronic, because of the nature of settlement, they only let you move money around so much before restricting it.
Basically the problem is solved through more liquidity than anything, but adding the blockchain as a verifiable source of transfer as well could eventually have other adopters over time, and make it require less liquidity to do so.

I bet what happens is when the 75% will be there and the first block is sent, the fork will be set to happen as planned. 
All Bitcoin companies supporting the move will switch over.  All companies on the fence will move to XT as the momentum will be there, and any company on the other side of the argument will see the momentum and most will move over reluctantly as well.
Then there are the neutral companies, those that may have an opinion, but don't want to share it and anger customers.  They'll like move over as well, but do so with some reluctance.
Its difficult for me not to see this fork moving forward and happening, if 75% is reached.  Its not as much about consensus at this point, as I strongly believe a good deal of the community is weary of this going on forever.  The reluctance of developers to truly get together and create a good short term solution has made this draw on for so long, and in some cases get so angry, that most of us just want to move forward with any solution.  
Its also possible when 75% happens, you see Bitcoin propose hard forking a size limit increase without moving to XT.  If that were to happen I could see XT failing and us likely having this issue again down the line, but the short term goal of raising the block size limit being successful.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:58:52
This.  If XT wins, I see this as a necessary step to bringing some civility back.  There may also be calls for a new lead-dev, as its clear consensus on difficult issues won't happen with the current lead.  Not saying its his fault, but this is just normal procedure on things like this.  At the end of the day, XT is as much a vote against confidence in the current Bitcoin core as it is a block size increase.

Most bandwidth concerns have been addressed for 8MB and below.
At this point its more hinged on egos and worry about hard forks.  
One is a legitimate concern, but a solution will have to be found and worked through either way.  Unfortunately, ego may greatly hurt the final solution.  When it does, and if it is clear it does, certain individuals in this community will no longer be respected.
I'm not naming names here, as the problem seems to go a little back and forth between sides.  Adults need to come together and agree upon a solution.
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:04:10
Regardless of if code is merged or not merged, you have two blockchains.  The key is for one to die quickly, and I expect that will happen.  Likely not as fast as the accidental soft-fork we had a month ago, but fairly quickly.
I think the writing will be on the wall in the next month or so for XT or against it.

It might make sense to ban transactions were the mining fee is X times greater than the amount sent.  If the minimum mining fee for a spammer would then need to be 101 bits, they would have to also send 101 bits to make it work, increasing the cost to spam by a fator of 10x from whats currently being done.
@_date: 2015-08-05 12:08:00
Peter Todd is poisonous to the process.  i'm not a big fan of sensational language from Mike Hearn as well, but I really am starting to believe Peter Todds long term goals is to spread division and hurt Bitcoin.  I don't believe that about any other developer pro/anti block size increase.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:59:48
It would need confirmations, otherwise it would be easy to double spend.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:39:31
You are correct they could pay themselves, but if they are paying themselves 101 bits instead of 10 bits, they can still do fewer transactions at a time as they will have to wait for the transaction to clear.
In other words, it creates a situation in both ways that reduces the overall damage they can do at the same cost.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:57:52
Very interesting article, and Mike is correct that every change to Bitcoin has the likelihood of disenfranchising someone.  
The risk to a hard fork in the loss of value, to the risk in doing nothing is also very true, however, this does not mean a hark fork does not pose a great risk to the loss of value of bitcoin.  Ultimately, the community will have to come together when a contentious hard fork gains serious traction to either kill it or make it the new bitcoin.  
Whether it is XT, or something else, I imagine this day will come at least once in the future, and it will be a defining moment is the ability of bitcoin to remain and grow as an asset of value.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:29:53
Thank you for proposing to do something, even if that something is not a perfect solution.  This may end up being something that core developers can at least agree upon for now, and it buys time to a long term solution.
In some ways though I wish you made it 2.1 MB  :)

Main takeaway, Coinbase CEO believes Bitcoin has the potential to be a 1000x investment at current prices.  Thinks every investor should buy at least 1 bitcoin both as an investment and to learn more about it.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:42:28
He could send himself the coin, but while he is sending himself the coin he has to wait for that transaction to be confirmed to send it again.  In other words if he is sending 101 bits instead of 10 bits to himself he now has to spend more bits to do the same amount of damage in the same timespan.
Its not a silver bullet solution, but it would help reduce the amount of SPAM someone could propagate on the network in a given time span at the same cost.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:28:35


This really isn't true.  A Hark fork can be disastrous, but it is not necessarily.  The soft forks that accidentally became hard forks proved this.  The community was not aware or ready for suck a fork, yet things got changed very quickly, and the ecosystem is up and running, growing, and the price has increased in the same time.
A well planned hard fork could actually run far smoother than a soft fork that had unintended consequences.  Sidechains will help quite a bit in the future, but this does not mean they are the only solution.

Seems like it had a lot less to do with ChangeTip, and a lot more to do with their option not getting real traction.
I think they created the tip button because they saw ChangeTip taking off and didn't want to be left in the dust.  The dust settled a bit, ChangeTip continues to grow, but the overall market for tipping this way is still not huge (although growing), and competing with ChangeTip would have wasted resources against their core focus.
So it was strictly a business decision rather than supporting the community and another company, but it was excellent spin on their part to get kudos.  Shows that Coinbase (really we already knew this) is an incredibly competent company.  They are willing to let go of something when it fails, try and keep their focus, and can spin negative news.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:45:54
Your cherry picking.  I am a fan of Coinbase, they are one the biggest Bitcoin companies, but that doesn't mean I don't look at things with a critical lense. 
or you could look literally below the thread were I say they clearly didn't drop the service just to be good to the community and ChangeTip, but they showed pretty wise savy spinning it that way.
Internal to their operations... seriously dude?.. Its pretty easy to know a little about what they are doing though if you follow Charlie Lee online.  When Toshi was released he explained how it would be easier now for Coinbase to move to Litecoin  if they chose now than before when it was strictly set up to Bitcoin only.  Now its set up to Toshi.  Of course, Coinbase has also publicly stated they are not interested in adding LiteCoin because it would confuse users.
Sorry if I try to keep up with things, instead of writing conspiracy theories or saying things are acts of desperation.

This is actually incorrect I believe.  Toshi was also built because they needed it internally.  They were originally strictly tied to Bitcoin, but with the setup of Toshi, its now easier for them to add additional currencies (crypto/fiat) long term.  This allowed them to be more agile moving to new countries, as well as keep the pace with innovation.
Toshi was basically a 2.0 or 3.0, etc.. of their own internal code base that they made public to also try and compete with existing Bitcoin APIs.
