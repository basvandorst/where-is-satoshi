This is fairly amazing

Looks like binance does offer that. I'm not sure if that's what your question was though.  Gdax does not.

You may not even have to exchange to ltc.  I think GDAX may cover your fee, which is what that step tries to avoid.  I always forget this ;)

In short, transfer from coinbase to GDAX.  Exchange the bitcoin for litecoin, and send it to Binance.  Then exchange it for whatever you like.  It won't cost much at all

The mobile app is quite good.  I don't think you'll have trouble if the phone is reasonably recent.  Both the app and the website could be a bit heavy on older hardware, but i'm not sure.

Try GDAX

There's no monthly fee at GDAX.  It's Coinbase's trading platform.

I should also note that you'll still be stuck with coinbase to transfer to and from fiat.

i haven't had any issues transferring between binance and gdax.  Performance has been spotty for a few days due to the spike in trade volume, which is something to consider.  I doubt the lg would have much trouble with the app, but I'd recommend downloading it to find out.  You can make an account with very little verification with a 2 btc per day transfer limit and give it a spin with a small amount of currency to see if it's going to work out for you.

You did it right, but transferring litecoin would have been much faster since btc has been pretty slow for a while.  I'm not sure how long you'll have to wait, but it will get there eventually.  Next time do the same thing, but use litecoin for the transfer.  This unfortunately is a problem until bitcoin scales better.

Of those 3, I'd check out Binance

If you must time it, trade logic runs counter to instinct for most people.  The chances of day trading this market successfully in the long term seem pretty bad to me though.  It's pretty unpredictable and the house usually wins.  Just hodl for the highest win chance.

If you follow emotion, you'll buy when it's peaking and sell when it's crashing every time.
You want to buy when you're pretty sure bitcoin is dying and sell when you're pretty sure it's going to the moon. 
 By my logic we're hitting a sell point before a retrace.
My recommended strat though is hold and win and stop trying to time it...works for me.
