Yes, absolutely it will cause problems. Officially in the US, you have 2 weeks from the time you move, to update your driver’s license to your new address. You’re essentially breaking the law. Granted, if it’s a scenario whereby you moved out of your parent’s and into your own place, it’s likely not that big of a deal. But if it was like 2 years ago, then all that background check is going to turn up, is a red flag. They may or may not choose to overlook it, but you’re asking for a hang-up at that point. Just update it. That’s a very simple thing to do, so you shouldn’t sleep on it.

Hmmmm ... That sucks. I can see it just fine using the OB application, but not with the OB web browser URL, even though I confirmed it was visible earlier. Let me take a look. Thanks for reporting this, I’m going to do some digging.

For whatever it’s worth, Gemini doesn’t take months. There may have been an edge case or two (let’s say more than that, but I honestly never heard of that). But unless you have a shady background to begin with, they won’t take long to verify you, maybe 2-3 days at most. That’s been my experience and everyone that I’ve recommended has had similar experiences.
But you can go the DEX route instead. A DEX is a Decentralized Exchange. Give BISQ a try. Start out with small amounts ($20-$40) at first. Then go higher once you’ve gained confidence.

Thanks again, I updated the URL and it will take you to the shirt directly.

I think at the moment it doesn’t affect it very much. But I’d be willing to bet that once large volumes start to happen on them on a regular basis, more so than on centralized exchanges, then they’ll wake up and leverage the DEX APIs if they have it. For one, Bisq has an API ... so once they start to feel threatened, they’ll have no choice but to get them monitored and make their exchanges follow the liquidity.

By the way, for those who don’t know about OpenBazaar, it is a decentralized exchange. You run a node and you can create a store or browse the ever growing inventory. It’s come a long way, but does have some stuff to clean up. Highly recommended for adoption.

Check out BISQ. It’s a DEX (decentralized exchange) and you can trade even higher amounts without all the verification information. It’s an additional layer of software to set up, but even the most minimum hardware can have it running in no time.

I don’t see how you’re contributing to the conversation by being a snarky pest. Do you? If so, please enlighten us. If you have information that someone doesn’t, why wouldn’t you just offer it and leave out your negativity. OP is clearly just starting out, or simply hasn’t come across something yet, thus why he reaches out to the community for help. You’re not helping OP or anyone else that sees this with your comment.

Dude, that’s fucking hilarious! You should post an address! I’d tip you not just for the art, but for this reply. It’s GOLD!
