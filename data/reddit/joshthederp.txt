Fuck yeah. Spamtec! Go bryce!
@_date: 2014-06-13 04:39:06
Yeah. Let's try doing this. I don't think it is possible as it is upcoming but god damn it, that would be cool.
@_date: 2014-12-27 07:22:19
That is really cool. TIL.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't assets only to be auctioned off if the defendant is found guilty? Ie: If the feds seize my money thinking it's drug money, they couldn't sell it until I'm convicted. Because if I'm found not guilty, I could theoretically sue for that money back.

With the Bitcoin prices dropping over the past few months, they are making a really dumb decision.

Nah. Pyramid schemes are usually more centralized than bitcoin and other currencies. Idk why people compare it to schemes, it's not a scheme, it's a currency. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:42:01
Same. I was at a party and a friend had me ELI5 how bitcoin works to him and his other friend's. I was so fucking drunk and it was so hard. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:35:23
Wait, "bitcoin bowl" is actually a thing? Or are we just circlejerking again?
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:15:47
What? The system is setup to where you can't double send or send "fake"  bitcoins.

 l live in the US. I plan on buying $90-120 once a month or so. Privacy is a bit important. I wouldn't mind cash deposits (bank or ZipZap or other cash wires, even bank deposits are ok if I can get it within an hr or two), or credit card. I don't want to attach or give my bank account info though. The zip zap thing isn't bad, I just don't like paying BitInstant's fee PLUS ZipZap's. When buying $100 worth, I need to do 105 to get $100 in MtGox plus pay the $3.95 ZipZap fee which leads to $8.95 extra just to do BitInstant's. 
That being said, which sites and methods do you recommend? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:35:59
Depends where you live. If you're in the south, than about once a month or less. If you live in a city where there's a lot of techies (such as Silicon valley) than I'd probably say once a week. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:55:38
Yeah, just thought about that. I'll just invest little by little for now so I won't have any regrets either way.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:01:11
True. However, even when it was in the media last year or even the year before that. No one really knew of bitcoin. Now everyone and their grandmother knows of bitcoin. Hell, I just saw 2 hippie guys talk about bitcoin that worked at a pizza joint. It seems kind of like a buzzword. Not saying that it won't be valuable. Not saying it will go back down to pennies. I'm saying it could plateu at around $200 or so. Maybe more, maybe less. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:08:41
Isn't purposefully destroying currency illegal? 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:13:03
That's the thing. I don't know if bitcoin will work out as a currency if it is really expensive. Not a lot of people know you can buy fractions of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:18:03
I might sound like a noob, but how on earth can you buy/sell bitcoins with no internet access? You have to have internet to send bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:16:30
Good point. Albeit a very small one. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:07:01
Most people don't use bitcoin (at least not yet), so it might be a while. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:55:29
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:25:33
I dont really care, I only have .6 of a bitcoin because I'm broke and I was late to the game. No one is going to try and steal .6 of bitcoin, lol. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:19:11
Where do you live? Here in TN there is no debating it until college. Just "Drugs are bad, mmkay." and "Use a condom." - That's it. In my 8th grade english class, the most we ever debated is if school should be year-round or not. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:01:45
Oh man, how I wish I have this problem. I bought into bitcoin a little late, and as a broke college student, I only could afford .60 bitcoin. I bought it at $200 a pop, so I've made double profit. I want to cash out, but am afraid I might kick myself if it hits $1k. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:52:14
It was inspired by this maymay: 
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:32:25
Yeah. I day traded and lost about $20 worth of bitcoin. Now that the bitcoin is fluctuating from $650 - $700, I'm going to give it a shot. I'll buy back in a few hours when it goes below $700
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:12:46
I don't think bitcoins will fail, I think it's already succeeded but it plateaued. Although I might be wrong. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:59:36
Hmm. Yeah I'd still buy. I guess it could only go up. I'm just worried about investing and it going back down to $15 or so a bitcoin and staying. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:32:47
I see where he is coming from. The name "bitcoin" does have a bad ring to it. That's why I didn't invest when it was at pennies per bitcoin. (dumbass me). Because we usually think of the term "coin" as little value. If they called it "bitgold" , I can see it having lots of value. Then "bitcoin" would be the name of a fraction of a "bitgold".
Ea:  John has 5 bitgolds and 25 bitcoins. (5.25 bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:20:19
I thought you were trying to predict that it will be at $100,00 USD by the end of the year. I was thinking "slow down, hombre, it's only at ~$800 and it's already December." 
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:00:07
I know that. But it is similar to a stock in which that the price fluctuates and the price is bases on how the public thinks how valuable is. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:44:20
I see. I assumed that it might be illegal because it's currency made by the government that is never going to have the ability to re-circulate. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 04:22:08
Will this cause bitcoins to inflate?
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:51:24
As a bitcoiner, that's what I'd do if I saw that on your badge. I'm sure a lot will. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:20:23
Ahh. bitcoi = fraction of a bitcoin? I haven't been sure what to say I have. Although I seriously doubt it will ever get that high. $1k max.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:40:10
I'm sorry for being a Negative Nancy, but what if something better comes along? What if it is just a fad, and the only reason it has gone up is because of the recent media coverage. 
That said, I have confidence in the Bitcoin, but I'm just plating devils advocate. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:55:13
Eh. I was trying to treat it like fluctuating stocks. Sell high, reinvest low. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:38:45
I know that feel, bro. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:34:15
Well, I'd have a QR code on the back of your badge. So someone wil be like "Shit, so you accept bitcoins?" You: "Yup. You can scan my QR code if you'd like." - Flip badge over.
