I'm sorry for not clarifying, I was very verrrryy annoyed and literally made this post, shut my laptop, and went to bed. [Here]( is a better image showing which transaction was NOT my authorized transaction. And I'm not asking for any tips. I'm just so fucking pissed off because I had printed the paper wallet, I just never moved my coins, and as a result of not doing anything I now have zero bitcoins. So, this is just another warning of MANY, that these fucking greedy fucking slimeball hackers are out there, and they are taking **A lot** of people's bitcoins. And me being a computer science major, I *never* thought I'd say this about a fellow hacker, but fuck them, they are styfling the progression of this crypto currency, they're supposed to be on **our team**, taking down the banks and the powerful people in the world, not attacking the people who have just enough money to buy in two bitcoins... So moral of the story is don't be an idiot like me and let them sit on a server where everyone has a potential opportunity to try and get into your account because I assure you, they will. I have a very secure password, its not even a word, its random letters and numbers. Which I know is just a matter of a brute force attack. But still, fuck.

I ~~have~~ *had* a very secure password. Infact, its not even a word, its random letters and numbers. Which I know is just a matter of a brute force attack. But still, fuck.

I did not have the google authenticator enabled. I doubt it was a trojan, my thought process is I was registering on a few different websites as I was researching about bitcoin and litecoin mining, I used the **same** password for registering these accounts (because I thought it was my most secure password and I didn't feel comfortable doing my usual password for these sites), I also used **different** usernames.. So my thoughts are, I registered on the wrong site, someone had access to the *IP address's*, usernames, and *passwords* of all registered users. Somehow got a hold of my username, which remains a mystery to me, and took out what was left in my account.

Anyone can start a currency, once its got value there's no stopping it. Think about it like drugs, they are all illegal, but yet they hold a value to legal tenders.

No problem, I would consider moving them onto a paper wallet, that's what I was *going* to do. It  randomly generates a deposit address and private spending address, both made on the client side (your computer), so the code is literally no where out on the internet, ever. (if you really want to be secure you can even unplug the internet cable from your computer when you make one). As opposed to keeping your bitcoins on any website because no matter how secure, they are still vulnerable. Trust me.
