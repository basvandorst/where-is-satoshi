That is why telecommunications antennas survive electric storms.
There are also bunkers and buildings which are resilient to EMPs.

In order for you to buy a foreign property with your local Fiat, the law of the location where that property is located, has to be compatible with such kind of sell. In the event it is, for example, you being a US citizen, wanting to buy a house in France, you will just buying the right of property with USD. 
The USD goes to the seller, and the taxes will be calculated in Euros (I think) and paid to the state. No deflation here.

depends on you definition of "supply decrease".
Will there be lack of currency? no... bitcoin is a deflationary currency where currently, the smallest unit is a 1 satoshi (10^-8).  
Can there be smaller values than 1 satoshi? Yes, if the bitcoin protocol is updated. That means an Hard-Fork.
How much does 1 satoshi currently values? 
At today's market value (1BTC -&gt; $14051.97 USD) 
1 Satoshi is $0.0001405690 USD
If Bitcoin reaches 1.4M USD, 1 satoshi will worth $ 0,01 USD

Japanese society is very very law-abiding. If the law says *they should follow a specific path*, then they will.
I understand that Japanese government has declared Bitcoin to be legal tender, but in my opinion, all those paychecks will end-up being converted to Yen by those who receive it, for conservative reasons over the rapid variation of the bitcoin value.
We have to wait and see how the workers will react when receiving the payment. If they are going to dump it for Fiat, or keeping a *savings account in BTC*

This is just my two cents, but the last bull run was during a massive buy at the exchanges, which means, for bitcoins to be sold, they have to be at the exchanges.
The exchanges require the coins to be transacted on the blockchain, and since the Lightning Network is still in the *test phase* and will be there for several months, if we have another similar bull run, the same problem will occur. 
In order to have a Battle-Tested Lightning Network, it needs to come out from the test phase in the first place, implemented by the exchanges and tested with another bull run.
Its gonna take a while...

Lol... You haven't understood it yet...
The cryptos, they are all interconnected. The professional tradders are milking the crypto currency cows. That is why they are going up and down all together.
Bots automatise and diversify all the fiat investments into cryptos and spread the fiat trough all the cryptos, so when they pull out and collect their profit, all cryptos go down. CNC chars prove that...

@_date: 2018-01-15 23:26:00
I don't think there is a single answer to that question.
My opinion is that there is no new money coming in or, miners are putting new coins into the market at the same time, an equivalent amount of Fiat is being injected into the market.
In order to have another bull-run, alot of new money has to come in. Maybe with a large expansion of the Lightning Network, I don't really know...
What I do know is that if the investors decide that Bitcoin is not going to give them the profit they though they could get in the short-term, then they will pull out from the game.

You are looking at BitCoin from the tech point of view.
**Understand this.** The crypto currency market is currently dominated by bot-trading, where they are capable of manipulating the price in a certain direction.
Traders don't care about the crypto's filosophy. Want proof? Go to [CNC](coinmarketcap.com) and look at the value plots from the top50 cryptos. See that line? See how they share about 99% of similarity?
Traders with their bots, don't care about the specificity of the currency. They only care about how much USDs they can profit from it. From the moment that the value climbed to insane values, all kind of traders were attracted.
Bitcoin is no longer the same currency from 2011. It is now overwhelmed by speculation where common folks can easily loose everything.
I think that 2018 will not bring the same gains that 2017 brought to BTC.

Assuming that you are US American here...
In case of the USA, the citizens of your country cannot stop using Dollars because that would mean the entire collapse of your Country's Government. 
Think about it. Every subsidy, tax, public construction and every single thing that works connected to the Government, uses US Dollars as currency, because that's the only legal tender accepted by the US Government. 
Then, we have the Oil industry, where Oil is priced in US Dollars. So, to stop using US Dollars, you would have to first stop pricing the Oil in US Dollars. 
*Could the Oil be priced in BTC?* -&gt; **NO!** BTC is too much volatile for that. Imagine an Oil refinery buying a entire Oil filled tanker and when the oil reaches its intended destination, the value of the BTC had already doubled or worse, plunged to 50% of its initial value... **It would be insane for both oil producers and buyers because both sides would be risking heavy losses.**
Then, there's the resistance of adoption, distrusts in a coin that could plunge more than 50% at any time without warning, confusion on how it really works (this is very common, for non-technical people), and other reasons...
BTC value is too of a roller-coaster to be used as a common daily currency. The swing prices are too high and currently in the crypto-markets, the transaction volume is very low.
I have seen sessions of one minute where not a single coin was traded (BTC/USD).

Regarding to *people wanting to sell being able to lightning to the exchanges*, yes it would, but we will have to see when will the exchanges will adopt LN. 
Remember that this is about Billions of USD. The exchanges won't take this lightly and regulations are comming down on Bitcoin.

Want proof? Look at Intel. They have added a third release cycle in their CPU development because they know that they can slow down the CPU development... They have all the resources they need. Money, Engineering, Scientific knowledge, pattents... everything. Do you think they are now doing the best CPU they can? No... Just look at the **[latest comment]( from Linus Torvalds to the Intel engineers, in relation to the [Spectre and Meltdown]( Intel doesn't care.

But yeah, after selling for USDs, *they* could then buy BTC, for a major dump afterwards. What could happen after that, is pure speculation.

Market resistance at 11K is weak. It value has being going down for the last days and there will probably be another test at 10K, the third in a week. 
If that resistance goes down, the value will go under 10K, probably into the 8K or 7K.

Ok. I have been hearing about potencial investors with that same issue. 
This kinda means something about the market.
By the time I'm writting this, the BTC/USD market has been dipping at Bitfinex for the last 6 hours. One thing I noticed is the incredible low volume at 1 minute sessions. I saw sessions with **No Volume at all**.
So, either there is a big divergence between sellers and buyers, or there is no new money coming in. My theory checks out with the low daily volume, which has been coming down in the past days.

The Big Christmas Dip killed alot of small investors. Many got burned and that created alot of bad publicity around the cryptos.
Currently, the market is filled with Bot Trading and Professional traders who only objective is to extract value from the market. 
Will BTC go above 20K? Dunno... [Check out the 1 year chart]( and ask yourself - "Will the BTC growth in 2018 be equal to 2017?"
The correction from the Big Dip is still not over... don't expect miracles. If BTC reaches 10K again, expect alot of panic sells from HODLers.

Just like every other pre-mined Crypto. If the market deemed it valuable, then it is, just like Bitcoin.

**Buying bitcoin or any other product does not cause Deflation of a FIAT currency.**
The only way for you to deflate a FIAT currency is to destroy liquidity, which means destroy money.

You are missunderstanding Bitcoin.
Bitcoin **IS NOT** an inflationary currency, like other FIATs, where supply keeps growing without a limit.
Bitcoin **IS** a deflationary currency. 
Because it is also a digital currency, Bitcoin can be divided indefinitely. You can transact 0,001 BTC or 0,0000001 BTC, or even less. That's how Bitcoin works.
With the increase in value, people will just keep dividing the coin to buy what they need, for less and less.
This creates the incentive for people to save money, so that later in life, they can buy their dream-house without having to take a loan.
PS: You don't have to buy a single BTC. You can buy a mBTC (0,001 BTC) or uBTC (0,000001 BTC).

Printing money equals inflation. It stimulates the economy? Tell that to Venezuela and Brazil...
Inflation fucks up the economy. It destroys savings and stimulates people to spend on things they don't need, because there is no incentive to save.
Then, when you really need the money, there is none. 
You want to stimulate the economy? Give people the chance to save so that in the future, they are capable of buying a house without loans. It is loans that have fucked up the entire world economy. Debt does not stimulate the economy, it just kicks the economic problem to the next generation, while making it 10x more difficult to solve it...
You are speaking about price-drops but you are thinking about bitcoin as a commodity. Bitcoin is a currency and should be treated as such. If you want to put a price-tag on it, don't just do it in USD, do it also in other FIAT and see how much it worth's.

This entire scenario around the Sirian war has always been about natural gas.

Thank you for re-formatting your comment.
In order to mine bitcoins, it is necessary to have:
* -&gt; A mining computer (CPU/GPU/specialized ASIC)
* -&gt; A power source
* -&gt; Access to the internet.
From those three things, the access to the internet is the cheapest, so I'm just going to ignore it and talk about the other two.
**"*1- A mining computer (CPU/GPU/specialized ASIC)*"**
Currently, specialized ASICs are being used to mine bitcoins. They are specifically implemented to do one and one thing only. To hash bitcoin blocks in order to validate a block with a specific nounce, resulting in a block with the number of zeros required by the difficulty algorithm.
Since implementing this process in a processing pipeline is easy, the only challenge is to find a way to have the maximum amount of processing pipelines in the smallest amount of space and to make it consume the least amount of energy.
**Currently, Bitmain S9 antminer uses 16nm FinFET  fabric chips, implemented at TSMC and consumes 1340W and is capable of outputting 14TH/s.**
Building such rig, consumes resources. Yes, it also produces jobs, but the amount of those is so low, we can despise them. **The important here is the earth resources (precious metals +  energy)**.
In the last year, the [**Bitcoin network hashrate went from 4EH/s to 30EH/s.**]( That's not doubling the hashrate, that's an increase of over 7 times! 
Current chipset technology is no longer following the *"Moore's Law"*. Intel as stretched the transistor doubling of the CPUs from two years to three years. **The point is, the technology advancement is not keeping up the pace with the hashing demand of the bitcoin network.**
**Why does this matter?**
In order for a miner to keep profiting, it needs to keep adding more hashrate to his mining structure. By design, Bitcoin mining output is (in average) deterministic. A Fixed amount of new blocks (again, in average) is mined every day. That fixed amount of blocks is (in average) distributed through out the miners [according to their hashrate contribution to the network]( **The more hashrate a miner hash, the more blocks he will (in average) mine.** I say in average because, since **the mining process is not deterministic**. But the more hashrate a miner has, the more likely is for it to find a valid block.
**So, if the Fabric process of these specialized ASICs is not capable of accompany the network hashrate demands, by outputting more hashes per second using the same power consumption, then a miner only has one way out to increase its network hashrate, and that is to add more mining rigs.**
Adding more rigs requires more available energy, which comes to my second item on the list. Available Energy.
**"*2 - A power source*"**
Depending on the geographical location, electricity will have different costs. This happens because of the way the energy is produced in that specific location, and depending on the stability of such power sources.
Bitmain for example, became known from creating the first bitcoin mining farms with a large size, in China. This happened because **Coal sourced energy in China is very cheap, but has the inconvenient of producing a large amount of pollution**.
Coal based energy, like the name suggests, requires Coal. Coal is a finite natural resource. 
Bitcoin miners who want to create their own mining farms, are always looking around the world for locations where the energy is cheap. Because of that, mining farms were opened in Iceland, Canada and other places where there's available energy. But this doesn't mean it is a good thing.
For example, [in Plattsburgh, NY,]( bitcoin mining was suspended *"because of bitcoin mining, it has already exceeded the allotted amount of hydro-power in December and January"*, so the locals decided to halt such operations.
You see, because energy was diverted from its regular use, from powering houses and the industry, to powering mining farms, the energy costs were soaring to the locals **(*"Some residents have complained that their electricity bills have increased by as much as $300, noted the report. "*)**.
Because energy was now being diverted to bitcoin mining, it cost increased to the locals. One could argue that **"*Oh! But because the energy cost is increasing, the magical entrepreneurs will come down and build new power plants because is such a profitable environment!*"**
No they won't... It takes years to build a power plant and it is not always possible, specially for renewable energy sources, which have specific geographical demands. And building nuclear power plants is out of the question in most democratic governed countries, due to its bad publicity. 
**Now, going back to my point of the energy being wasted.**
You said well. Bitcoin mining by design consumes lots of energy and that is the way to keep the network secure.
But the problem with this design is that the network hashrate is not being increased to maintain the network secure. It is increased so that a miner can increase their profits, as a consequence of the difficulty increase, which is the answer of the difficulty algorithm to the increase of the network hashrate.
While the network hashrate increases, so does the power demand, due to the technological limits which is incapable of responding to the demand.
**At current pace, the network hashrate is increasing exponentially and with it, the energy consumption**.
The increase in the hashrate is the natural answer to the difficulty increase, because miners will need to process many more hashes in order to find a valid block. **Processing Bitcoin blocks is very power-demanding, because there is no other way than through the Brute-Force way to do it.**
When a mining rig process a block and sees it is invalid, it discards it. **Invalid blocks have no use! They cannot be used to record transactions. They cannot be used for anything**. So in simple terms, from the miner perspective, it was wasted time and energy.
Add the energy and resources costs to build the rigs, along with the increase in energy costs to the local population, and you have an energy crises.
**3 - The Lightning Network is the answer to the energy crises?**
No it is not. The LN will not make a dent to it.
Why? Because the Lightning Network is used only to transfer coins from one client to the other, using an near-to-instant process. **It is not used for mining and the problem is the mining energy consumption!** The LN solves the transaction delay issue, but it does not solve the energy issue.
In my opinion, the only way to help the energy issue, is to find a way to recycle invalid blocks and use them just to record transactions, although I don't see how that is possible.
**4 - To summarize**:
* -&gt; The problem is the energy consumption by Bitcoin mining, which is the primary source of profit for a miner.
* -&gt; The Bitcoin  network hashrate demand is increasing exponentially.
* -&gt; Increasing the network hashrate directly increases the energy and natural resources consumption.
* -&gt; Cheap energy source locations are few in the world, which will create a social problems.
I hope this helps for you to understand my point of view.

Social evolution is profit. The problem with capitalism is the fact that it only understands the concept of monetary profit. 
That fact alone, is the reason why Capitalism fails to successfully manage a Health system. The USA is a perfect example of a capitalist country where a capitalist-driven Health system simply fails to achieve its goal.

Bitcoin model assumes a continued rise in the value of bitcoins. Since the bitcoin inflation is, in average, deterministic, it will take quite some years until all bitcoins are mined. Let us hope that when such date is reached, society has reached a tech-level which no longer requires the need for money.

Think of value of a product, as the capacity of you to be able to exchange it for something else that you need.
You work, to create a product which the market deems it a valuable product. The scarcity and demand of such product, will increase its value. By increasing your product value, you will be able to exchange it for a set of products which you and the market will end up negotiating, until both reach a consensus on the equality of value.
Gold is usually refereed as a "good way to store value" mainly for traditional reasons. For the better part of the last 5 thousand years, gold was and is still used as a currency in most parts of the world.
Gold is considered to be value, because well... there's a market demand for it and it's a scarce metal with good properties. It does not oxidate, it is a soft metal which confines the capability to be easily minted, amongst other good reasons that I cannot remember now.
Because gold is a very scarce metal and of difficult access (needs to be mined in very specific geographic regions), it's inflation in the market is very well controlled. Also, a large portion of it is confined in vaults, jewellery, technology and others, which reduces even further the easy access to it.
Fiat currencies on the other hand, depending on the policy of the Central bank who mints it, may be inflated beyond control, which reduces the trust the market has in keeping it's "*value*". 
A currency is only valuable if the market deems it as so. Gold is seen by the market as a good storage of value because there's a strong trust it existent amount will not be inflated beyond control.
The capability to restrict the inflation of a currency is necessary, otherwise the market will simply demand more and more units of the currency in order to satisfy the balance of value for its available products.
Different currencies have different inflation rates. In 2008, during the US House market collapse, the Swiss Central Bank introduced negative interest rates, because their bank's clients were exchanging their US Dollars for Swiss Francs, which created a shortage of liquidity in the Swiss Market. In order not to inflate the currency (as far as I can recall) they introduced negative interest rates. It was a incentive for the clients to invest their money into the Swiss economy, instead of just having it parked at the Banks.

Ok some observations regarding you comments




Well, for me it is pretty easy to choose which institution should be prioritized to receive energy. Between powering a Hospital or a Bitcoin mining farm, I would choose the Hospital every single time. But that's just me. And yes, powering Christmas lights just because one can buy them at premium value, is a pretty stupid thing to do. If you can't understand that... well, let's leave it there and never to talk about it again. It's not a matter of fairness, capitalism, communism or socialism. It's just a matter of good sense and every fair choice will surely have it. 
Energy is not unlimited and it consumes resources. Bitcoin only has value if there's an underlying economy to use it. If Bitcoin mining farms start to destroy the local economies like a nuclear disaster, the local people will rebel against the miners. **It is unfortunate that capitalists and libertarians seem to be a ignorant or simply choose to ignore the reasons that powered and nourished the communist revolutions in Russia, China and other countries.**








I'm sorry but your statement is simply wrong and [the collected data demonstrates just that.](
See that chart which is plotting the Bitcoin network hashrate? Can you see a collapse of the network hashrate after the bitcoin crash from the ATH to 6k in January? **You cannot... because it did not happen!**
The chart proves that even in the event of a Bitcoin price crash, the hashrate can still maintain and can actually grow. **The hashrate will grow while it is still profitable to mine. That hashrate chart proves my previous statement. [Miners will mine while it is profitable for them to mine.](


It matters and you should already know this... It is pretty obvious, no? The smaller a transistor is, the less energy it needs to function. Smaller chips means more chips per square cm. More chips, means more hashpower per square cm. This means that by reducing the chip size, you can get more hashrate using the same amount of power. That's why we now have laptops capable of being powered during a day using only one battery charge... [But you can't reduce the size of the chip forever due to physical constraints. There's a limit.](


If a miner is loosing money, it can either:
* buy new and improved rigs which will give them more hashrate for the same power
* move their current rigs to a location where the miner can get cheaper electricity
* do a mix of the previous two
* shutdown everything and retire


So it seems!

It's difficult to mistake Bitcoin from Bitcoin Cash, specially when buying from markets. Both symbols and values are different. Don't take me wrong but no, I was never that n00b. Maybe that's because I have been here since the very beginning and the only wallet I have ever used was the Bitcoin core wallet. But that's just me...
I understand your point of view, but honestly, this is not a child's game. Maybe it's a place where child's should in fact, not be present. The fact that the very own crypto ecosystem is embedded into the internet, makes it of easy access to little kids who see it as a game.
To me, that is the problem. Buying and selling crypto should not be that easy. There should be a maturity barrier so that those involved, know what the stakes are.
Don't take me wrong, but honestly... I find it very difficult for me to mistakenly buy Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin. 
If someone commits that mistake, that someone needs to stop, learn a bit more about cryptos and then yeah, invest in them. Committing such mistake reveals lack of maturity in investing into the crypto market. It means the person doesn't really know what is doing...

When Bitcoin price goes down, it becomes more appealing to buy, that is a fact, but only to the investors who believe Bitcoin will regain its previous value. But the thing is, if the new investors aren't enough to go up against the older investors who want to cash out, I don't see how the price will ever go up. And then, when the price goes up, the fears of another crash begin to stack up. 
Also, Bitcoin is no longer the only crypto being used by retailers, since Ethereum and Litecoin are currently being accepted.

I doubt that there's such a study, at least with decent quality. But that has never stop me from trying.
The bitcoin network is currently consuming (in average) around [**183,939,488 KWh**]( according to Digiconomist, placing it right before the Czech Republic. 
**The Czech Republic has their population number around 10M.** So, according to Digiconomist, the Bitcoin network is (almost) consuming the same energy that is required to power a somewhat efficient economy with a population of 10M, in Central Europe.
Now, this energy cost by the bitcoin network has two objectives:
**1** - To create new coins at a deterministic and controlled rate.
**2** - To register new transactions in the network.
This means the Bitcoin network consumes the energy just to maintain these two objectives.
I did not put the security objective in the list, because the competition for the network hashrate to mine new coins, implements the network security as a by-product.
Traditional, banks a set of services beyond the service of managing and keeping your money safe. 
The service of just keeping your money available is pretty inexpensive, so that many banks don't even charge you for keep your money in their banks, to have a debit card and can even provide a small interest rate.
Banks also provide financial investment services, like when you want to buy a house with credit or even when you just want to evaluate how much your house is worth in the market, if you want to take a mortgage.
Now, the Bitcoin network is currently confirming around [**200K transactions per day**]( The global banking economy easily overcomes that value in a single second. But still, the question remains. **How much energy does the global banking system consumes?** There's no way to know exactly, but one thing is sure. **The energy consumption of a bank will be the least as possible to keep things running, because energy is money and Banks are there to profit. Bitcoin, on the other hand, will see it's energy costs increasing as more and more hashrate is added to the network, while the maximum number of processed transactions per day remains the same and, the number of mined bitcoins decreases.**
You will notice that I did not talk about money printing. I did not mention that because banks do not have that capability. If you live in the EU, you would now that banks (public and private) get their liquidity from the ECB. 
*The governments from the EU countries CANNOT borrow money directly from the ECB.* This is established in the EU treaty. So for the banks operating within the EU, they cannot create new currency. Only the ECB is capable of doing that. And the ECB has such autonomy established by law, that not even the European Parliament can order the ECB to create new currency.

To keep those 10%, you need to add the same ratio of hashrate equally to the previous blocks. That becomes harder and harder to do and the charts demonstrate it.
You need to compare the hashrate growth using a 3 month window or 6 month window and you will notice how the hashrate growth rate is decreasing. This is normal since there's a finite number of places to build mining farms.

You are talking about transportation and management. The thing is, with fiat, once you transfer from one place to the other, the costs of securing are minimal. If the money is in the electronic state, it's basically in a record. No energy waste here. If the money is actually minted in coins or notes, then it can be in vaults, which may not even require energy to operate.
With bitcoin, the costs are a constant, whether there is coins being transferred or not. Mining simply cannot stop, otherwise it would jeopardise the network security. 
Also, miners are constantly adding more and more hash to the network, increasing the energy consumption, while the difficulty algorithm increases the difficulty, to keep a deterministic and controlled bitcoin inflation. This means the Bitcoin mining energy costs increases with the increase of the hashrate and also, with the halving of the bitcoin mining reward.

That's because you can't. Both systems are different and the current fiat system is much more complex than the Bitcoin blockchain. 


Please, read my comment again. After referring my points, I spoke regarding the security of Bitcoin. Yes, the power guarantees the integrity of the network. But miners aren't working for the integrity of the network. They work for the mining profit.


Yes it is. Let me tell you why. 
Mining bitcoin blocks requires brute-force solving. **Brute-force solving a valid Bitcoin block is non-deterministic, where every invalid block is wasted energy. Invalid blocks cannot be used for transactions and are useless for the blockchain.** That is why hashing algorithms which focus on security, are developed specifically to cause the maximum amount of energy waste when solved using brute-force techniques. This removes the incentive to try to break the hashing algorithm using brute-force attacks.


Then prove it. 
EDIT: It seems that the Digiconomist article provides the [comparison between 1 Bitcoin transaction and 100K of Visa transactions]( It is not the energy consumption by the entire banking and fiat infrastructures, but it can put things into perspective.

He would become poor and nothing would happen. The people who received their bitcoin share, would want to sell their bitcoins for US Dollars, which would then be transferred from external banks into the Venezuelan Central Bank. Here's the thing. The bitcoin sellers would never receive the US Dollars, but they would received its value in Venezuelan Bolivar. The government would confiscate all those US Dollars and use it to keep the army under their pay.
The problem with Venezuela is not the hyper-inflation of the currency. It is the Venezuela ability to pay its debts to external suppliers, mainly pharmaceutical companies and others. The Venezuelan economy is basically halted. The only thing keeping the government in functions, is the military support, which is kept using the US Dollars coming from Oil sales. In other words, it's the Oil that is keeping Nicolas Maduro in power. Without the military support, Nicolas Maduro would be dead long gone.
So no, Bitcoin by itself will never change the country regime. 
Also, the Venezuelan government has become very efficient in censoring the country internet access. If they saw that Bitcoin was actually making an impact, they would simply cut down the internet access and internal communications or at least, prevent bitcoin transactions from going out.

TCP connections use a client-server model. The client connects to the server and requests something, which the server answers. The end.
The LN model is more of a P2P model. Channels are more like open paths, composed by multiple peers. The TCP model does not use multiple peers to establish communication between a client and a server (not actively, anyway). 
The biggest challenge with the LN is to make sure the model is capable of scalling up to millions of users, when opening a communication channel through multiple peers, while making sure the channel stays up during enough time and has enough funds to process the payment. The availability of a channel will depend upon the availability of the network nodes and their local peer connections.
So, the channels in LN are more like communication paths in wireless mesh-networks.

That's BS. If the energy grid is inneficient (maybe where you live, certainly not where I live), then the energy is already lost and even more is being consumed by bitcoin mining.
That argument is the one used to maintain the idea that powering Bitcoin mining farms is actually a responsible thing, since it is using energy that would otherwise be wasted. 
Maybe in the USA the national energy grid is shit, but in the European Union, it is perfectly normal to balance the energy inputs and outputs between countries, in order to maximize the energy efficiency.

I'm sorry, but your assumptions are hard to bite.


Institutional investors are there to make money. 2K, 6K, 10K... it doesn't matter. For those who have access to billions, those prices are peanuts.
But there's one thing institutional investors like, and it's assurances. They like to make sure they will get their profit, one way or another. This is where Bitcoin still could fail.
I agree with you in the sense that Whalers will control the next crash, but in my opinion, the whalers are the institutional investors. In my opinion, they are already in the market, making money and moving their pieces into key places of this massive crypto-game. 
Why am I certain of this? Ask yourself. If institutional investors likes assurances, wouldn't they want to have control of the game? They will do what they have been doing in every market. Controlling it. 
Bitcoin is a scarce currency right? Control a large piece of the currency, and you will control the direction of the market. 
HODLER's don't control shit. They are out of the market. They have no influence on the bitcoin market value. Yes, some of them will probably get rich, but not that many.


Billions would need to enter the market for that and institutional investors are not there to inject value. They are there to profit. To take value out of the market.


Maybe yes, maybe not. Good for you, if true. 
Edit: At 4,4K, there's a large piece of the network hashrate which will disappear, since it will no longer be profitable to mine for a large portion of miners.

You just need to establish a sliding window for the last 6 months and then go back one month at a time, and calculate the Exponential Moving Average for the previous 6 months. Then, calculate the growth ratios for every six months. 
You will notice the reduction of the hashrate growth ratio along the time, **which is normal!!!**.

To my understanding, a Zero-Sum game is a game where both players actions cancel each-other (Zero Sum). The OP example is not the case since there's actually $300 missing. 
To be a Zero-Sum game, those missing $300 needed to be accounted by the action of another missing player.

They make money by setting Bull traps and taking the money from newbie investors, who get their buttons triggered by FOMO and then, when the market suddenly crash, they panic and immediately sell... because well, they are noobs...
This is one of the things that cryptos brought into this world. Noobs who think they can become professional traders by just watching some YouTube videos... The trading world is immensely complex and there are traders who are pure genius people, with PhDs in statistics and financial trading. 


Not really. That is a fallacy. Professional traders can still profit by doing what they do, which is trading. Professional traders have no intention to hold on for their dear life, because their main concern is risk-management and portfolio valorization. 
HODLING in the long term is for the casual investor, which does not want to be concern about the mundane issues of portfolio management. 


Also, not true. You assume that with scarcity, everyone will want to immediately jump-in. But such thinking only applies if there's actually a need to buy Bitcoins. For example, retailers are already adopting other cryptos, such as Ethereum and Litecoin. So that scarcity which you are referring to, doesn't actually applies unless there's a real demand to use Bitcoins, which currently there's not. 
When the price goes up exponentially, the amount of money which is required enter the market, in order to maintain the pace is also exponential. This increases uncertainty and fear of another crash.
Also, when the price goes up, it becomes more and more difficult to get a profit, equally large to the profit which early-adopters got, the 1000% ratio profit. This is a hype-killer.
That is why when someone brings those 2013 charts and states "Bitcoin will recover like it did before, when going from $100 to $1K... I honestly don't believe it". This kind of behaviour only happens once. If it gets repetitive, professionals get on board and suck the value out.
So no, whalers will always make money, even if the market is crashing.
Bulls make money,
Bears make money,
Pigs get slaughtered.


You don't know that. They can also dine in Hell...

Your math is wrong.
Increasing or decreasing the network hashrate, does not accelerates nor decreases the mining speed of bitcoin blocks. Maintaining 10 min (in average) between blocks is the difficulty algorithm job.

Edit: The average time between mined blocks is around 10 min, and it has been [for a very long time](

It's not the Tether cap that is the problem, it's the other markets where USDT is being used. For example, Bitfinex does not distinguish USD from USDT. It's the same thing for them.

Which is not happening. Whalers continue to reinforce their positions and the best market players will get the most strong positions.


Which creates the incentive to use Bitcoin as an investment and not as a Currency.


I was in well before Bitcoin was worth something. Don't compare me with your petty friends. You don't know me.


Means nothing. The rally from $100 to $1000 was artificial and performed by two bots. The rally from 10K to 20K was performed by an insane FOMO and pumped by loans. Bitcoin has yet to  surpass the 10K with a solid and sustained position an we are in May. Max Keiser promised 25K by the end of March and he was wrong. It went twice to 11K, not without returning to 6K again. Investors see this as a highly volatile asset, knowing it can blow in the faces at any time. Swing trades however love this, but they are there to make money, not to support the project.
If you think the high value is what gives Bitcoin a good credibility, then you are naive. I would prefer a low-value for a long period of time, in order to create the incentive to use bitcoin as a currency, than to have a bitcoin with large deltas of high and lows.
But this is just me. Of course fanatics want to see moons... I, on the other hand, want to see stability and adoption. Fuck me right?...

That is true. I honestly believe that the entire crypto market is compromised and that there is no real market or if it exists, it is much, so much smaller than what it actually can be seen from the chart. I don't believe the Bitcoin price value is a real reflection of the real Bitcoin economy. 
To me, this is a negative side. The price went up way too fast... It should have taken longer...
Bitfinex itself with USDT is mostlikely one of the sources of wash-tradding and market manipulation.

No. You are completely wrong. My stance is of a person who does not want to see users to see their investment disappear, which may still happen if people continue with this HODLER nonsense.


That's pure BS. For Bitcoin to succeed as a currency, it needs to be used as such and for that to happen, it needs people spending it on products, not HODLING it for life! **Bitcoin does not need the help of the same institutions that fucked up the global economy. Asking Wall Street to participate in the Bitcoin Market, is like asking a pedophile to babysit a children's party.**
Hodlers only help in one thing. To make sure scarcity is created in the market, so that whalers control the rallies and dips of the market and take their profit out of the market by safely shorting Bitcoin. Control the supply of the market and you control the market itself.


[Hot-hand fallacy]( - *The sometimes fallacious belief a person who experiences success with a random event has a greater probability of further success in additional attempts.*
Listen to me. I have read several times, naive users of this sub, stating the same thing over and over - *"this has happened before. There was also the crash from 1K to 300. It always recovers..."*
**No! There was never a crash equally damaging like the crash of January - February**. That crash removed billions from the Bitcoin economy. There has **never** been a moment in the Bitcoin history where a crash took that much money out of the system! 
Watch the price value in a two-year chart and you will notice that instability and volatility in the Bitcoin market surged after the crash. This is terrible for Bitcoin. Instability is not good for something that is supposed to be a currency! If you want adoption like I want, then you do definitely do not want instability.

There's no way to know if Tether will honour their word and provide 1USD per USDT. But the most amazing thing is, if you buy 100 USDT in the market, you will have to spend more than $100 USD.

Since Bitfinex is an unregulated market, they may very well be providing inside information to whalers, in order for them to manipulate the price value.

What makes you think those are the ones shorting Bitcoin? It makes no logic when you state that having unlimited access to fiat, provides the capability to short bitcoin and make a profit with it.
 You don't need to have unlimited access to Fiat, in order to short Bitcoin. There are other ways to short bitcoin with profit, Margin funding is one of them.

True, the military budgets of the EU countries is tiny. The USA has the policy of printing money to pay their debts and to finance the weapons industry. 
The EU on the other hand, has imposed austerity measures on several EU countries in order to avoid printing money in an uncontrolled way. The Germans remember what happens when money is printed without control.
Still, I believe a good defence plan can be achieved without the excessive expenditure on the likes of the USA military budget. If the Russians can do it, so can the EU.

That is a vast oversimplification on how a large-scale energy-grid works. It simply does not work like that.
Power-plants are always (or should always be) integrated in a country or continent energy-wide network. This allows the energy to be transferred from one geographical location to another, balancing the energy requirements in the network. The European energy network does exactly this. It allows countries to import or export energy on demand, providing the possibility to manage energy generation in a very agile way.
Intelligent energy management allows the countries to switch on or off their power sources, depending on the needs. This allows to have a more efficient management on how the required energy is generated, balancing the energy generation cost, CO2 emissions, and natural resources management. For example, you cannot expect a Dam to be generating energy 24/7. Dams serve a dual-purpose. They provide energy when the minimum water level for exploration is surpassed, and also provide the water requirements for its consumers. During dry-seasons, Dams are not generating energy, because people need to drink water obviously.
EDIT: Power-plants also have specific requirements. You cannot expect a power-plant to be built on-demand. Dams require specific a geographical location. Wind-turbines require locations with a constant flow of air. Nuclear power plants require a lot of water for refrigeration and the same goes for gas a coal power plants.

I never said that. None of my comments referred that. 


You are too young to know that. Bitcoin may have given you good profits so that you could buy a car without taking a loan. **I understand that. I bough a house!** But I'm also not a US American, so student loans is a thing I simply don't know and is one of the reasons why your country has a big educational problem.

The type of questions Bitcoin actually needs. I'm not going to be here babysitting. I'm simply not that kind of person. You don't like my questions and arguments? You can simply ignore me.


No you didn't. You did the same thing like every early adopter did. You bough a big amount of coins at a very low price. I know I did the same when the coins value were under $5 dollars. 
I didn't bet a lot of money... I bet around 2% of my monthly paycheck... You don't need much time to carefully think about such investment... you just need to not go to a night-party for one month.
**The reason why early adopters were so successful in taking such amount of profit, is because to go from 1$ to $10K requires much less money to enter the market than when going from $10K to $1M. Totally different amounts of money. The difference is huge! This is why so many BTC fanatics want the so called Institutional Investors (WallStreet they think) to enter the market. Because billions are required. But Wallstreet is the same entity that fucked up the global market and there's only one thing they want... profit!**
Yes you made a fortune, but to repeat such profits, the adopters that enter the market will need to see the price value go from $10K to more than $1M, to see the same profits ratios. 
But here's the thing, the more it goes up, the more incentive early investors will have to exit the market. Everyone wants to have their lambo, right? I know you did! You bough your car, right? I bought my house...
And for them to exit, someone will have to buy the coins at those higher values, with an ever bigger belief that someone will re-buy those same coins at an ever higher value... otherwise, where is the profit??
And to end my point of view, the fact that you bough your car, paid your student loans, just demonstrates that Bitcoin is still seen as a financial investment.... **I want Bitcoin to become a real Currency, not a speculative investment!**

The UK has separation of powers. You have the Prime-Minister and then you have the Queen. The Queen has the power to "relinquish" the Prime-Minister of his powers.
Other countries also apply a similar approach. Spain and Portugal are such examples. Portugal has a president and a prime-minister. Separate powers. Separate elections.
Also, the UK is in the process of leaving the EU. They voted out two years ago and they have a large-set of their own regulations, which were negotiated between Bruxels and London. 
I have to be honest. I don't think that having a collection of AR-15's would help you in the case of you wanting to rebel against a possible Tyrannical US Government (if that actually is possible to exist).
IMHO, that kind of scenario is the wet-dream of every redneck, guns-lover nutcase, which is the result of a low-quality education system and constant brainwash by religious supported, right-wing propaganda.
The US society is kept in a constant-fear of a possible communist invasion or government tyranny, so *better buy lots of guns &amp; ammo and support the private weapons industry*, the same industry which sells to the Government and pushes wars abroad...
Again, I have to be honest. As a European citizen, in the current state, I have no intentions of ever setting a foot inside the USA, mainly because I would not feel safe or free, in the sense that I would feel a constant pressure to be on the look-out for something wrong or dangerous situation. The amount of negative propaganda towards other countries that runs in the US news channels is insane... Not to mention the harassment I would suffer at my local airport, just to take a flight into the US...

Yes they use. But banks don't provide just the means to transfer money. They also provide many other investments services.
The bitcoin network is used exclusively to transfer coins from one address to the other. If you want to make investments, let us say, in building a new company or creating your own business, you are going to have to resort to some **investment firm**, to perform a solid investment.

Nope. you are wrong. If that was true, then the price would never go down and yet, here we are, at the $8K doorstep.
Price discovery is established with market action. Just because the supply is low, doesn't mean the value will go up. It can easily go down if a) there are no buyers willing to pay for a higher price; or b) if there's no real urgent demand for bitcoins, which is most likely the case since retailers are already accepting other cryptos (bitcoin dominance continues to fall).

I work in embedded software development for network environments. I've also done some game engine development in the past, but nothing serious. 
Imagine if I developed software using node.js... I even had some recent graduated students hinting me to use docker to manage the applications installed in embedded devices. They didn't even know what a cross-compiler is... Serious problem here. 
I don't advise anyone to develop applications or libraries in C. Leave C to the kernel and use C++ for applications and libraries. C++ when properly used is as fast as C code. In some cases, its even faste since the programmer can hint the compiler to do further code optimizations. Also, it is less messy when the developer learns how to properly use the STL and take advantage on the language standards. 
Currently, I'm also messing around with Rust, maybe to substitute C++ in the near future, when I can harness the same kind of power in Ruse, that I can get from the C++ templates.

Fanatics have been pushing that argument for months now. But every time the price goes up, bitcoin looses even more market share. Top-traders have been dispersing their investment because they tap into several markets at the same time, so its easier to take their profit out. If they threw everything into bitcoin, the price would immediately go up, but the probability of crashing down would be immense, since the real liquidity would be squeezed out with smaller sell orders.

The present monetary system is not one but several systems, whose management rules change, depending on its geographical location. 
[The current crypto-currency market is highly vulnerable to manipulation]( where in the case of Bitcoin, hoarders have the capability to manipulate the direction of the market. The lack of regulation for crypto exchanges, allow and create the incentive for inside-trading, where the use of high-frequency trading to further manipulate the price value, prevents any kind of investment coming from conservative investors.
The fact that crypto-currencies are purely virtual requiring computers to be used, generates some distrust for older investors, opting to invest in Gold which can be see and touched.
For example, Petter Schiff, a long time Libertarian and Gold Bug, states that the crypto currencies are nothing but bubbles since they can be replicated anytime someone wants. In my opinion, he is not wrong with his statement, since merchants are already accepting other cryptos, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc.
Also, Libertarians and Bitcoin fanatics are constantly throwing the justification that Bitcoin will prevent the Government from stealing a person's money, [which is a fallacy.](
So, Am I against Bitcoin or other cryptos? No. In my opinion, crypto-currencies are very interesting and yes, they will change the way how the world handles money, but I'm not betting that it will make the world a better place. We had the Gold standard for centuries and we still had wars and famine.

The shitstorm of coding possibilities that Javascript allows, is the very foundation for most slow-to-the-death apps that have been developed for the so called *"mobile world"*.
Most javascript coders can barely understand how a CPU works, let along structuring procedures using efficient algorithms. They import everything just to *"quickly develop an app"*.
Regarding `bitcoin-ts`, that is good! At least, there's someone out there who knows what he is doing.
Edit: You forgot to mention it was TypeScript, not pure javascript :)

It's not. Every time an Uber transporter is transporting someone, it is providing a service. The service has a cost and the person who requests the service pays for it. When an Uber transporter is not transporting someone, he stops the car and waits for further instructions to arrive. It does not consume energy.


Huge vaults don't consume energy most of the time. They are built and that's it. Physical cash being transported is just a very small amount. Most of the transactions are electronic.


You need sources to support that claim. Renewable energies in most cases, are more expensive than burning coal for example. That's actually the reason why Bitmain installed their mining farms in China where Coal energy is cheaper.
Anyway, the issue with Bitcoin wasting energy is because when an invalid block is mined, that block is useless. Bitcoin mining is non-deterministic. There is no way to know when a Bitcoin block is going to be found. If you have lots of mining rigs, your chances of finding a block increase, but there's no guarantee. In truth, every invalid block that is mined, throws energy away which could be used to power industry or electric cars for Uber.
When an extracting company decides to mine gold, they first do prospecting missions to determine if the area really has enough gold worth to be mined. There's no such thing with Bitcoin. 
So, from my point of view, your analogy does not hold, but you are free to defend it in another way.

What math? Unless you give me sources about those numbers, what in the world are you expecting me to do? Did you just threw numbers into the post for fun?
How much gold was mined in the 90's? How much gold was required by the market during the tech revolution of the 90's? Doesn't that count to increase the value of Gold? Or are you only taking inflation into account as the cause for the rise of the gold value?
Yes, 200.482 was the exchanged rate defined for the Euro in 31 of December of 1998. So? What does that has to do with Gold or inflation? 
But hey, lets go with my *knee math* with **sources**.
In 1989, one ounce of gold would cost around $401 USD. At an exchange rate from USD to Escudos at the end of the year of 1989, which was [$1 USD to 149$80 PTE]( then $401 USD was around 60069$80 Escudos.
In 1999, one ounce of gold would cost around $295 USD, actually less than in 1989,how about that! At an exchange rate from USD to Escudos at the end of the year of 1999, which was [$1 USD to 199$98 PTE]( then $295 USD was around 58994$10 Escudos! 
**Holy Sh*t! It was actually cheaper to buy one ounce of gold in 1999 than in 1989**, even after a little devaluation from an exchange rate of $1 USD : 149$90 PTE in 1989 to $1 USD : 199$98 PTE in 1999! How about that!

In 1999, 200 escudos would be enough to buy around 8 expressos, each costing an average 20 escudos.

But not blindly. Bitcoin mining is done blindly and on purpose. In fact, it is necessary for its security, like you previously stated.
Also, once gold is mined and processed, no further excessive energy is required to transact it. Only the energy for a person to give some gold coins to another person.
On the other hand, Bitcoin requires energy consumption, not only when it the blocks are mined and create new coins, but also every time it is necessary to register a transaction. Remember, to register a transaction, a mined block is required.
To make it even worse, a bitcoin transaction will most likely consume less energy today than in one month from now, if the network hashrate continues to grow exponentially.  


I've lost you there. I'm assuming you are referring to the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, so what do Greece, Turkey and Italy have to do with the previous?


You are assuming you can actually save money. On of the biggest problems with the current millennials, is the fact that they can even get to the end of the month with enough money to save for later days. That's a much more complex subject which goes out of the scope of this topic.


Well... they require an internet connection, which you need to pay. No internet access, no access to the blockchain.
Btw, for banks within the SEPA zone, transfers will be executed in less than 24 hours. Yes, it's  still more than a Bitcoin transaction, but you can easily do it comfortable at home using an online access.


Bitcoin requires the same infrastructure to work.
The Internet is supported by cross-atlantic fiber optic connections, thousands and thousands of optic routers and switches and millions of miles of fiber distribution to the home. Also, frauds will still exist in a bitcoin powered world. The same infrastructure that supports banks around the world, is the same one that supports Bitcoin, with the extra plus all of the Bitcoin mining farms.
Honestly, if you sum all of the energy that banks need to just perform money transactions for their clients during a year and you divide it by the total number of performed transactions, you will most likely get a smaller value than the total energy consumed by bitcoin mining in a year, divided by the number of bitcoin transactions performed by the network in the same time-frame.
But the thing is, banks business is not just transfer money from one account to the other. They also provide investment services, business analysis, they lend money to start new businesses, etc, etc. Long gone are the days where banks would only keep your money in a vault.
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:22:47
Like I previously said, Bitcoins itself aren't stored. Bitcoins don't actually exist. What exists is a transaction record, which in the case of Bitcoin mining, there's an genesis transaction which the miner awards to itself by issuing a transaction to its wallet and recording it on the Bitcoin mined block which was recently mined. After that, it's just transactional records from one wallet to another, recorded in the next mined blocks.
There's nothing to be stored except for the Blockchain records.

Well, that's the problem. Dropping the type safety creates more problems than it solves. I have issues with it all the time in Python, for example, where type evaluation is delayed to the run-time phase (and is actually optional), which is a waste of processing power and consequently, a waste of energy which does not go around with mobile platforms. I had to add countless assertions through out code that I have implemented, so that other programmers where I work, wouldn't fuck up when using it just because they skipped reading the documentation... just to code *faster*.
Then there's the insanity which I've seen over and over with Javascript. The craziness of the so called *"programmers"* which during a programs execution, are constantly morphing the objects type... From strings to ints and ints to strings, over and over without any kind of control, just to make that error disappear quickly without actually understanding what's going on...
In order to make the best code, the programmer needs to understand the problem and the solution. 
Removing the type safety from a language and give it to a programmer who does not understand the problem nor the solution, is like opening the liquor cabinet to teenagers and telling them *"here's the solution for all your life problems. Enjoy!"*.

Well, the problem now is, the cycle has repeated enough times to become predictable, which makes it a problem. If it can be predicted, then it is open to be exploited.


Gold has an advantage. To make it work as a currency, it does not need to be continuously mined. Once it is mined and minted as coins, you can shutdown the mining operations and still use it as a currency. With Bitcoin, you cannot do this. Bitcoin needs mining to be constantly working.

They don't. Depending on the geographical region, different entities will have the means to "*print money*". Money doesn't actually gets printed since most of the time its just an electronic value. But what's important here to retain is which entity is the one authorized to do so. In the case of the USA, it's the Federal Reserve. In the case of the European Union, it's the European Central Bank. For example, countries within the European Union do not have the power to simply ask the ECB to give them money to spend. They are actually forbidden to do so ([Article 123º of the Lisbon Treaty](
This is why Greece and other countries had to undergo through austerity measures and not just print out of debt like the USA did.


No, you are mistaken. A block is not found after exactly 10min. A Block is found every 10 min in average. [To be truth, is actually less than that (again, in average)]( Blocks can be found after 30 seconds or 1 hour, but what is important is that the time average between blocks of 2016 blocks is as close to 10min as possible. For this, the difficulty is adjusted. 
[See also the last Bitcoin mined blocks for today and compare the timestamp between them. You will notice that there's not 10 min between them.](
Also, if the difficulty is higher, then its more likely than a higher number of invalid blocks will be mined. If the difficulty is small, then a smaller number of invalid blocks will be mined.


That is true and false at the same time. The protocol assures you that you can find a valid block, if you provide the network with enough hashrate, in the case you are mining alone. That is why the average miner opts to join efforts with other miners in a mining pool.
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:22:30
Best comment!
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:12:29


Not exactly. The difficulty algorithm kicks in every 2016 mined blocks. It takes into account the time between each of the last 2016 mined blocks. The invalid mined blocks have no effect on the new difficulty value evaluation. 
Valid blocks are useful because these are the ones in which transactions are registered and make part of the blockchain. On the other hand, invalid blocks have no use and are simply discarded. 


That's where different points of view collide. It is seen by many as a waste of energy because instead of using the energy to find a valid block, it could be have been used to power industry. 
If the consumed energy came from a green source, then it is less green-energy to be used in industry, requiring to get the extra energy from other non-green sources.

There's a lot of youtubers out there in the world, probably too many. I think the reason why youtube is demonetizing videos is because a) lots of users are now using ad-blockers and b) users are dispersing through many youtubers, so the videos are actually providing little income.

For some time it is, but that's just the bots doing their thing and selling to willing buyers which are found at the lower regions. To maintain a sustained bottom, the volume needs to keep rising, even if it is at a lower pace. What seems to be happening after these dips, is that the volume rises and then starts to go down slowly, until there are no more buyers... 
Bitcoin is also at a psychological region. Since the price has rocketed twice from this location, newbies will now suffer from the [hot-hand fallacy]( thinking that what has happened in the past, will have a greater probability of happening again.

What? Lol that is a massive oversimplification...
I asked about production, not water resource capture. And no, picking up water with a bucket is not producing water.  It is just taking water with a bucket.
Also, just because it appears to you that there is a lot of water available, does not mean it is not a scarce resource. Fresh non-salted water is actually less than 1% of the total water supply in the world. It is a scarce resource.

The volume has been falling for a very long time. So, those who are willing to sell, do not want to sell at low prices. Those who want to buy, are not willing to risk at this price because they don't know if they will be able to profit, since the market can even dip further.
Looks very bearish to me, without real market demand.

Where I live, the cash-back concept exists but it's not popular. The same goes with credit cards. Unless someone travels a lot to countries outside of the EU, there's not much use for a credit card, specially when you have to pay to have them. The large majority of people uses Debit Cards. For online shopping, banks provide virtual cards which can be used for online shopping and online service payments. These virtual cards can be issued and revoked on-demand with specific a max-spending ceiling, preventing abuses from online sellers. 
Since interest rates are currently very low, there's zero incentive to buy on credit and only pay at the end of the month. Also, due to the austerity measures imposed in some European countries, the idea of paying for stuff with borrowed money is not seen with good eyes.
Also, the money which the bank gives back, has to come from somewhere, right? It will come from those who are abusing their credit cards, without control. This is what kills economies...

The bitcoin blockchain is not a computer network. You can't communicate using the blockchain per se. 
The bitcoin blockchain is in fact, binary information, replicated throughout many computers. If you run a full-node, you can have a copy of the entire bitcoin blockchain on your hard-drive. 
What you can do, is by using cryptographic algorithms, to sign the transaction information, and then use the Internet to communicate the transaction and spread it to many nodes around the world.

Lack of consumer confidence is actually the today's market problem.

It is silly for you to compare Java with Node and I pretty much doubt your statement about Node destroying Java performance. I written my share of searching and analysis algorithms to say this, but anyway, I'm not a Java developer... my drug is modern C++.


Dynamic programming abuses from memory use and its optimization at the CPU architecture level is limited. Even with the V8 engine optimizations, dynamic languages end-up lagging behind. Hence, there's a reason why V8 is implemented in C++ and not in Javascript... 
And less error prone? A language that gives no type evaluation at its procedures interface? Sorry, but I highly doubt it...
But hey! Javascript is easier to learn right? And faster to develop right? I wonder then why is Slack sucking more than 300MB of Ram, just to give me a chat application... 
But hey... who cares right!? After all, now we have 16GB of RAM in our computers and 4GB of RAM in our mobile devices... Its not that battery is important, so it doesn't matter how many CPU cycles a program wastes, when running an application.

EDITED to improve explanation. 
Due to the mining costs. 
The mining network hashrate has increased exponentially, which directly translates into increased mining costs. Because the difficulty algorithm kicks in every 2016 mined blocks, the average amount of bitcoins mined per day is about the same, even if the miner increases the mining rigs in his operations. But with the increase in mining rigs, comes the increase in energy costs, assuming the miner is capable of buying more energy from the local providers, which in many cases, they cannot.
This directly translates into an increased cost to mine one single coin. If the bitcoin value falls bellow the break-even value, some large mining operations could shutdown. This may destabilize the network hashrate, facilitating attacks to the network.
Miners incapable to add more hashrate to their network, will see their energy costs remain the same, but the the mined bitcoins output will begin to reduce, since their share of the network hashrate is reduced, once other miners increase their hashrate share.
In my opinion, mining hardware have done more damage than good to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is going to start to feel that. Bitcoin gold solved this issue by changing the hashing algorithm to one that is ASIC resistant, something that Bitcoin should have had since the beginning.

Incentives and compensations exist in different forms. Trying to make a point by stating that people get things done just for the money, is libertarian BS. 
Why do you think teachers go to school every day with the will to teach and pass knowledge, even though they know that their paycheck at the end of the month will be shit. They do it because they love to teach. That's their incentive. The same goes to musicians, writers, artists...
The effort is best when people have safety and security to do all of the things they love, without thinking if they are going to starve or die at the hospital with no medical care. Eliminate the scarcity of resources and people will no longer fear to do what they love, without thinking if someone will actually buy their product.
Like Capt. Pickard said: "We no longer feel the need to accumulate wealth. Our objective is to improve humanity."


Power generators, which are machines and devices, built by engineers, who love engineering. 
You are using a flawed rationality. You are assuming that a future cashless society is at the same technological level that we are today.
In 1991, there was a CS student in Finland, who was angry at the fact that he couldn't use the new capabilities of his new PC, which had an 80386 processor. 
Unix was a proprietary, closed source OS, which had an immense monetary cost...
Because of all those reasons, for free, the CS student developed a new kernel called Linux. His name was Linus Torvalds. By merging that kernel with the GNU tools from the Free Software Foundation, established by Richard Stallman, they were able to create the first Free Open Source operative system. Their objective was freedom to change and freedom to improve. 
They were not paid to do it. Their incentive was not money. Microsoft on the other hand...

That is true.
That is why there's also the need to look at the [Hashrate chart]( which shows how the hash rate has tripled in the last 6 months.
Since the difficulty algorithm adjusts the mining difficulty every 2016 mines blocks, to keep an average bitcoin mining output, the only thing increasing here is the energy consumption, which translates into higher costs and less profit.
If the bitcoin value does not increase rapidly, miners are going to start to shutdown mining rigs or shutdown entirelly.

I could also count on the fact that the transactions could be kicked off the memory pool by other new transactions with higher fees, and not actually spend any funds.

Because by not using USD and using USDT, they are not obliged to comply with regulations regarding FIAT operations (KYC, for example).
The issue with accounts for US customers, its because the US Government has an aggressive stance regarding making sure their citizens pay their taxes, related to crypto operations. 
This is not exclusive of the crypto exchanges. This happens with banking outside the US. There are many banks, specially in Switzerland, who refuse to work with US Citizens, because they don't want to have the issues with the US Government.
PS: If you are an US Citizen, you should think in getting a foreign passport or marry with a foreign partner so you can get a foreign citizenship.

I think it's tin-foil-hat.
Many bitcoin fanatics have been calling for the comming of financial institutions.
What thse smucks don't realize, is that financial institutions are only interested in one thing. Profit.
So why is the price going down? Is it market manipulation? Well, unregulated markets always have manipulation.
So what is this time?
In my opinion, two things. 1) No real demand; 2) Bear market.
Why buy now when you can by later at a discount? Now, the tricky thing is, when is later the right time?
My guess is that bitcoin is largely overvaluated. We know for a fact that the price was pumped (manipulated) from 150 to 1K, so there's no reason to think there wasn't also manipulation from 1k to 20k.
So, maybe bitcoin is just correcting and this is, maybe, the result of having a market without manipulation. Maybe bitcoin value is droping becaus the real correction isn't over. Maybe the real value is bellow $100, before the real manipulation started.

I agree. That is why we have the Lightning Network, which is yet to prove that is capable of keeping a proper operation independently of the number of peers that it has (capable of scaling).


Not sure what you are saying here. Moving on.


Satoshi is not a God. No need to worship is work. The definition of peer depends upon the subject/theme/context in which it applies. In the context of Bitcoin, a peer is an entity which interacts with other entities in an ad-hoc network of digital payments. I say ad-hoc because the network has no structure.

Change the hashing algorithm to [Quantum proof hashing algorithms](


Solution? -&gt; Hardfork. Done.




Hard to calculate. Also, it is not the amount of hashrate that secures the network. Its how well is the hashrate distributed by a large number of miners. [Hashrate distribution](


The problem is having access to electrical energy. The amount of available energy for mining is finite and where it's available, not every energy supplier is willing to sell it for Bitcoin mining. Different locations will provide energy at different costs, which means, the miners who can get the best deal, will be able to secure more hashrate.
With the increase of the hashrate, the cost of bitcoin mining will increase, due to the mining difficulty adjustment which is done every 2016 mined blocks. The bitcoin inflation is controlled, but the cost to mine is not. The more hashrate is trowed into the network, the more expensive it becomes to mine. The locations with the most expensive energy, are the ones who suffer first.
If a government wanted to kill Bitcoin, there are easier ways. They could just slowly buy bitcoins on the market or, make some OTC deals for large amounts. Then, they could just dump it into the market, creating fear and chaos.

Why do you say that Bitcoin is still in Beta ?
This is not some shitty web application from some unicorn-powered start-up, who thinks that having their products in beta for life is something cool. 
This is the code for a network which transfers value from one side to the other. 
The fact that LN is still in Beta means there are still issues which need to be addressed. It is not a release version. Things can still change and people can still easily loose their money. Use it at your own risk. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:44:40
Not really true. For example, Bitfinex does not have a USDT/BTC pair, but accepts USDT tokens (they are the sister company of Tether after all....) 
For Bitfinex, USDT is the same as USD and so, it is impossible to tell if someone is buying BTC with USD or USDT. 
Since the rest of the markets (ex: GDAX, Bitstamp) follow the path of the Bitfinex price value for BTC, they could be very well pumping the entire market using USDT and using a fractional reserve system for USD. 
No one can know for sure, until everyone tries to transfer their Fiat out of the market or try to reclaim their USD by returning their USDT to Tether. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:33:36
Look... it's pretty simple.
Who is selling at 6K? Those who believe we are in a bear market. They short-sell at 6K and stay on cash until the BTC value drops even further, which is a high possibility at the moment. Then, when it rebounds and confirms the bull breakout, they will re-enter the market with all the cash they have.
90% of the strong BTC traders do it for the money &amp; profit, not some religious belief that it will be the economy of the future.

In order to increase the number of mining rigs, you need access to energy. Some miners could try to build, for example, a Nuclear Power plant. But then, they would require permits for such.


Not really. That is a miss-conception. Remember the difficulty algorithm.
Energy is limited and Bitcoin mining operations require lots of cheap energy. The increase in hashrate has a 2016 block window, before the difficulty algorithm kicks-in and limits the block output. Hashrate increases, operational costs increases, bitcoin mining remains the same.
Smaller mining operations may face pressure here, which might bankrupt them, where bigger mining operations increase their share of the total hashrate. 
This is actually an issue, since it increases the chance of a 51% attack.

Plausible does not mean it would be efficient or even effective. You have to understand the constraints you would have in managing such network. I'm assuming you would want to use the same frequencies of HAM radios, which mean, you would have to share voice communication and at the same time, send and receive thousands of Bitcoin transactions. We have to assume lots of other Bitcoin users would do the same.
This is the case where you would have a massive mesh-network and let me tell you, this is insanely hard to manage do to its indeterministic properties. Been there, done that.

No it's not. Massive unemployment in a small timeframe is bad for the economy because it means less clients buying products and services. Unemployed people tend to cut back everywhere they can, specially in a capitalistic marker with lack of social support. 
Also, you assume every worker in banking does the same thing, which is also not true. You also assume a person working in banking can simply switch to another job instantly, without effort, which is also not true. There's a series of factors which employers do not like. Adaptation time, worker age, CV, experience at a new, different job, etc... All these things don't happen instantly, but unemployment does.


You are being radical. Caterpillar provides machines for workers to do work which would be impossible to do by hand. It helps a constructor to do things faster and more efficiently.
If we use technology to cut-back every job in the world and automatize everything, while maintaining ourselves in a capitalistic system, we will end up in a world where 0.00000001% of the world population owns every single means of production, and the rest of the world population just becomes redundant and starves to death or worse... becomes slaves from the fully automatized new world order, commanded by a few human masters.
[*You are probably wondering now why people kept coming to work in such an environment. The first and main reason was the deep economy crisis France was going through at that time (and still is today, to a certain extent).  Having a job and a salary was considered a privilege, no matter what conditions were attached.
As to how a government can let such things happen: we all know how it works. The guys in charge of budget at the ministery are pals with the top-management in a number of companies. In a country like France, corruption is not uncommon at that level, goes mostly undiscovered and is rarely prosecuted. Apparently this is not reserved to France. I have heard the same stories a little bit everywhere in Europe and the US.*](

Until clear evidence is provided by Tether, I have to assume the worse. At this moment, what you have is a single private company, who mints USDT at its own will. 
Tether fired the company that was performing an audit, citing unclear reasons. CoinMarketCap shows that the top 4 BTC market pairs, are with USDT. Bitfinex does not separate USD from USDT. For them, its the same thing.

They (the trustees, the lawyer, the courts) are in their right to do what has they pleased. For what I can tell, everything is being done by the book. The lawyer even requested authorization from the court to sell more.


Because they didn't knew how up the market could go. Like the lawyer said, he tried to get the highest price. I believe in him and I'm sure he got a big pay.


Because it was when he realised the market could crash to zero and it was time to get the most liquidity out of the market, while it still existed.
This shows us a couple of things.
1) Crypto markets do not have that much of liquidity.
2) Crypto markets are incredible fragile to these dumps, which means there aren't that much bulls with the capacity (or will) to buy these dips.
3) Crypto demand is actually low.
4) Crypto value (in general) is too high. It should be lower, so that dips are easily absorbed. Lower value means more liquidity to absorve dips like these.
5) Cryptos are being treated as investments and not as currencies. That is why investors keep them at exchanges and not in private wallets. This is confirmed by the low number of validated transactions per day, in the last 2 years.
Lessons should be learned from these crashes...

The problem is not on the long run, but on the short.
I repeat. **Last year, PoW energy demand increased from 10 TWh to more than 50TWh. It is humanly impossible to sustain such rate with renewable energy.**
Also, miners always look for the locations with the cheapest energy, in order to boost profits. They don't care if the energy comes from renewable sources or not.


Energy consumption grows because the mining difficulty is increased along with the increase of the hashrate. On the other hand, the reward stays the same.
This increases the mining costs, since the miners reward is reduced. In order to maintain their activity, miners need to sell some coins to pay for the operational costs in FIAT. If Bitcoin price does not maintains a sustainable and constant increase, the less efficient miners will have to shutdown, which may put the network at risk, by tipping the fragile balance of the network hash rate. 
Current bitcoin price value is incredibly unstable and don't blame FUD, because if you do, then Bitcoin has already failed to secure a solid market. It would mean that even the smallest shake would obliterate its foundations. 


That's tin-foil hat behaviour... They don't care. They own the means of production. Bitcoins will come to them in the right time.

This is not a very convincing argument because securing the Bitcoin network is only useful to those who use the Bitcoin network and are still a very small minority in the world.
Even with a small minority of users and miners, the bitcoin network is already consuming enormous amounts of energy, and is already [have encountering resistance by local populations, who saw their energy bill spike]( 
[The hashrate has doubled in the last three months]( and it is expected to continue to grow exponentially. This will demand even more energy to sustain such amount of miners, where these miners are only doing it for the profit, not to really protect the network. The energy that could be allocated to electric cars and industry but instead, it is used to provide short-term profit to miners, which will shutdown when it is no longer profitable. Remember, the bitcoin difficulty algorithm is used to maintain a small, constantly reducing and tending to zero but predictable inflation rate.
So, the argument of "securing the bitcoin network" is not very convincing.


The Visa network processes per day what the bitcoin network processes in more than a year. All those 600K employers are working and receiving a paycheck. Is this bad? I don't think so...

You will always have fraud. Fraud doesn't exist because banks exist. Fraud exist because criminals have an incentive to commit fraud. You stop the fraud by destroying the incentive.
Governments become corrupt because the industry has the incentive to corrupt the government. In the bitcoin ecosystem, whalers have good incentives to corrupt authorities, governments, etc. Bitcoin by itself, does not remove fraud, it just changes a bit the rules of the game.
Remember, the world worked for years in a Gold Standard and fraud existed (so did banks).


I have my serious doubts that Andreas is right in this point, and I support my claim with what I said before regarding the hashrate. It is increasing at an exponential rate. He has never mentioned that. Ever.
Also, Bitcoin by itself, it's just a currency. Banks by themselves, are not responsible for the creation of money, they just provide financial services and that is not going away with cryptos. Also, those services can also be more efficient with time, but there's a limit.


Easier said than done
Current finfet size is around 14nm. There are fabrication procedures for 7nm which are being fined-tuned, but you can only reduced up to a minimum value.
For example, Intel has already increased the tick-tock cycle from 2 cicles to 3. They are delaying the release of newer processors with smaller designs, mainly because they know there's a limit and they have yet to figure out how they are going to proceed beyond the 5nm-4nm designs. 
[Current hashrate is doubling around every 3 months]( Finfet technology is reducing the size of the transistor every 3 years (not 2, Intel changed that.). Do the math. 
[Bitcoin profitability is already at around 60%.]( Once it gets around 10%-20%, miners are going to start to feel the pressure to kill some mining nodes. In my opinion, this is going to be the biggest challenges the Bitcoin Network is going to feel this year. 
Will miners survive with lower incomes? Will miners want to continue to mine, with lower incomes?

Find me a miner that as already committed to deploy or build renewable energy facilities to feed their power-hungry mining facilities. Two reasons why some miners went to Iceland: cheap energy and very cold weather. 


Such innovations are expensive and will not be deployed in the near future. PoW is already consuming energy and energy demand will continue to grow. You are talking about what might happen. I'm talking about what we have today.
EDIT: You are also not taking into account the fact that we are currently transitioning into a world with Electric Cars, which will hugely increase the demand for electrical energy. 


No. Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 mined blocks and it is increased or reduced, depending on the amount of time that it took to mine the last 2016 blocks. If the Hash rate of the global miners is increased, then the faster the next 2016 blocks will be mined. The difficulty algorithm kicks-in and increases the difficulty so that the speed at which the next 2016 blocks are discovered is reduced.


I am. Demand is down. We can see it on the number of confirmed transactions per day, which is at a 2-year low. Kids point to transactions batching, which is stupid since the confirmed transactions would still be up, if bitcoin was being transacted between thousands of peers every day. They aren't... They are being transacted from and to exchanges, meaning that bitcoin is being used primarily as a speculative investment and not as a currency.
The current Bitcoin market value is under 10K, less that 50% of the ATH. Market daily volume is falling where volatility has increased, denouncing weak order books at the markets (books with a low number of orders). This is why every time someone sells a large amount of Bitcoins, the market price becomes very unstable.
Market volatility undermines the existence of Bitcoin as a currency, since it increases the retailers risk of accepting Bitcoin as payment.


No, it shows specific weaknesses in the bitcoin market and crypto markets in general. Mt. Gox lawyer actions in the last two months showed that. It demonstrated how incredibly aggressive bitcoin HODLERs can become if someone tries to sell large amounts of bitcoins they own, even though they it is entitled to do so.

You are Wrong. [This is why]( 
0.5% of the addresses already own over 80% of the coins. We can assume that whallers are already part of those 0,5%. 
Today, market price is established by exclusivly by exchanges.
It doesn't matter how much BTC is available, as long as it's traded. In fact, if you cut the supply, they can manipulate the market to rally and then hit the sell button to create dips, creating FUD about the BTC state. People panic sell and whalers get their cut.
For example, Bitcoin Whales bots are manipulating the market by buying and selling in the order of miliBTC very quickly. I saw them pushing the value down during the crash, to raise panic and force others to sell.
They could do this over and over... and all they need is some help from Tether...

Because the reason why we need money, it's because our society has yet to reach the technological level, where it is capable of creating and moulding matter itself to what every purpose it requires. Think of it like the replication technology from Star Trek, from where people get the food they so desire, along with other things.
Until then, we will have to resort to mining minerals and farming, to maintain our society. Since mineral resources are scarce where many of them are impossible to synthesize, we use money to establish a generic form of value for different resources.
With money, we are able to trade different resources, using a generic form of value. 
If we we had the replication technology, there would be no scarcity of resources, hence, no need for money.

If that happens, bitcoin would be destroyed before anyone could do anything. Those are the kind of things that happen when you are asleep. You wake up to realise that every bitcoin you had, is now gone.
By breaking the hashes, it means that the cracker would have access to every funds in every wallets. 
There would be no solution for this. But then again, the hashing algorithm used for the wallets is also used in many other applications in the civil world and military world. The Bitcoin state would be your least of worries to deal with. 
Redoing the transactions would basically mean, to modify the past transactions. This would be detected if a rogue full node would be trying to propagate a copy of a modified blocked chain.

After that, I could only go to the bank and exchange my national currency with Euro.
How did this came to be?
Because there was a period of preparation for more than 10 years, during which a virtual currency called ECU was used as an intermediary currency, to establish a parity between the different national currencies.

The US is a higly-regulated economy. It has always been, specially during the great-depression and during the WW1 and WW2. 
The Soviet Union no longer exists. Currently, in Russia, you have more freedom than in the USA.


Yes, you are missing Venezuela and Vietnam. I could also pin-point other countries where although their governments are right-wing governments, they are so corrupt that there's actually no difference. Brazil and Angola are examples.


Let me guess. You live in the USA? If so, you should travel beyond the borders of your country. You would be amazed to discover the countries where people really want to live. I'm sorry to say but the USA is not one of those countries.
Btw, you didn't give me an example of a country which has a free-market economy.
I can give you one. It was short-lived, but existed. -&gt; Zimbabwe.
After its monetary collapse, Zimbabwe lived a somewhat free-market, anarcho-capitalist society. This happened mainly because the government was so powerless, becoming incapable of enforcing the law in its entire territory. This allowed warlords to rise and enforce their own systems, through the power of arms. But like I said, it was short-lived. Didn't work, with all the fighting amongst themselves.

Is acting on the behalf of the ones who were affected. I was one of those who received a letter from Japan. Fortunaly for me, my balance at the time at Mt.Gox were a few satoshis. So few, I didn't even bother to reclaim them. 
I chose not to act. Those who chose to reclaim, the trustee is acting on their behalf. 


How do you know that? Source? For what we know, he got the highest price he could get. 


What ever he choses to. It's in his right to do so. In my view, the clients of Mt. Gox knew what they were getting into. I transferred my coins to my wallet as soon as I got them. All of them should had done the same. 


This is how the game is played. Welcome to the free-market, where regulations don't exist and everything can happen. 


Actually, he profits from it because if he does a good job, he gets a better payment. That's how lawyers work. Also, I'm pretty sure he has good advisors on how to unload the Coins, since he's, or someone paid by him, has been doing it for the last 4 months. 
If you think he is responsible for the 6K crash, think again. It was bound to happen. The market was bound for a correction. Every decent analyst knew that.
Tell me, what about Bitfinex and Tether? Doesn't it bother you that Tether spread USDT through the entire crypto market? 
USDT is the atomic bomb that can level the entire market and you are concerned about a miserable 166K BTC?
Have you seen the Bitfinex cold wallet? They themselves could turn the crypto market into ashes because no one knows if Tether really has 1:1 parity with the USDT. To make things worse, when someone transfers USDT to the Bitfinex market, they are automatically converted to USD, which means, the pair USD/BTC is more like USDT/BTC... and guess who minted billions of USDT right before the crash? You got it... Tether... 
Did Tether really sold every USDT they minted? No one knows... they never let their accounts get audited by an independent auditor...
This is what you get with the "free-market"... greed, manipulation and destruction.
EDIT: Honestly, I more than welcome regulations to the crypto-market. It will help to stabilize everything and provide transparency to the market. 


Bitfinex is a suspect on that. Not only the gain fees from every executed order (like every other market), but there's also recordings that provide suspicion regarding inside trading.
These exchanges are run by people who are already rich beyond their dreams. They don't care if all goes south. If the market crashes, they don't care. They will just close the door and move one.


The claimers are pushing for market sell. They want their invested fiat back.

You are asking the wrong questions and it seems that you don't understand how everything works.
Lightning network is intended to provide an off-chain transaction mechanism, with very low fees, to provide the possibility of transacting using very low values (day-to-day operations, like buy a cup of coffee).
What you should be asking is **"What will happen when mining a block provides low or no profit at all"**.
You see, the current Bitcoin mining network consumes around 50TWh per year. The network is still very small and there aren't many places left in the world with available energy to power such mining operations. Also, the social impact cannot be ignored, because if power companies prioritize mining operations and increase the energy cost for powering houses and industry, people will rebel against the mining operations. 
Since mining operations in China will cease this year, due to government imposition, miners will have to look for other places, which will increase the energy cost while the reward is halved... Some of them may not be able to find other locations, and shutdown completely...
This will increase the possibility of having a 51% attack to the network. The number of new blocks per 2 weeks will remain the same, since the mining difficulty is properly adjusted by the difficulty algorithm every two weeks, but remember, the reward will continue to decrease.
In order to have transactions, blocks need to be mined. If mining is not profitable enough, then there will be no incentive to mine new blocks. Less new blocks will increase on-chain transactions fees. Increased number of transactions will increase the transaction fees.
Accordingly to [blockchain.info]( the 7-day average number of confirmed transactions is around 190K per day. This means less fees for the miners.
Currently, the entire Bitcoin ecosystem on the bitcoin price speculation. Retailers business that accepts Bitcoin is still residual and I believe the most of them will most likely sell the Bitcoins afterwards for fiat, due to several other reasons (pay their employers, pay to the suppliers, pay taxes, etc).
The current value swings on the bitcoin price, prevents it's use as a regular, day-to-day usage as a currency. Why would anyone use a currency that could in increase its value by 10%, in one day? It would be stupid to spend the Bitcoins and not spend the Fiat.
So, everything is still tied to the Bitcoin value speculation. If bitcoin value drops bellow 5K, you will probably see several miners stoping their operations. 
[The confirmed transactions 7-day average]( is currently at the lowest values for a 1-year timeframe. This kinda proves that Bitcoin is currently used as an investment and not as a currency, otherwise we would have seen an increase in transactions, due to the massive adoption of segwit by wallets.

Not true. To margin trade at bitfinex, you need to have funds in a separate account, the Margin Wallet. Only funds in the margin wallet are used in the margin trading and, used to cover for the losses. 
I doubt that there are long margin traders out there, from what I saw on the funds markets. Most funding expires after two days. These funds are most likely used for pump-and-dump schemes.
Margin traders borrow from the market just the necessary amount of funds to bump the market value, and them start dripping the coins they bought with margin funds. The profit from these funds will then be used to payback the money borrowed. After that, It's all profit, wether is sold high or low.


That is why asked you for your sources. You are making just assumptions.

It's easy to show a daily chart and say "the daily volume is almost the same", but when you inspect in the 1min chart, you will a small number of sessions with big volume spikes, surrounded by lots of sessions with ultra low volume .

I did not refer floating point but ok. I play your game.
In both cases, Integer and Floating-poing, to increase mathematical precision you need memory. 
With a massive adoption worldwide and people loosing private keys, it is perfectly viable that BTC will be valued well beyond 100M USD per BTC. It will still be required to increase the precision well beyond the value you suggested.

Yes I have. You have to understand it from the user point of view. 
95% of the people in this world, don't understand how bitcoin blockchain works nor how bitcoin itself works.
But those same people understand how a bank account works.
They understand how they can get money out of a bank account, by going to an ATM.
Bitcoin needs this, as a transitional path of initial massive adoption. It provides trust and time for the regular folks, to understand it, adopt it and use it.
If you think the USD, EUR or any of the other fiat currencies are going to evaporate during the night, then you are dilusional.
That's not going to happen, neither will a massive adoption of bitcoin occour during the night.
Bitcoin needs a transition path. It needs to enter the banking world in order to change it.
That is why having a banking account in bitcoins, so that I can use a debit card to pay my accounts anywhere in the world, with a different currency, is something that I truly wish for.
Also, my job does not pay me in Bitcoins and there is no place in my town that accepts bitcoins for my day-to-day operations. I need live cash or a debit card for that.

The cost of a bitcoin to mine is very deterministic.
You just have to measure the amount of electricity consumed by the mining rigs and the human resources to keep it operational.
Then, add the initial investment which is amortised over a period of time (one year probably). Divide it by the average amount of bitcoins mined per day, and you have the cost of mining one bitcoin per day.
Then, it's just a matter of subtract that result to the average value of one bitcoin in the market, in a day.
I pretty much sure that value has been reducing over January...
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:18:56

Even worse then. I was assuming that the distribution of each one of the 0,5% addresses, was in the best case a 1:1 scenario. If a single person owns multiple addreses from the top 0,5% richest addresses pool, then the concentration of bitcoin wealth is even worse, leaving the door open to price control and manipulation.
EDIT: Exchanges have one address per client. It's the only way for a client to transfer bitcoins into their wallet in the exchanges, and out of the exchanges into their private wallet.

That depends. You could simply deny in court that you didn't knew about the existence of such data in the blockchain. It's up to the acusation to prove that you knew.
But, for example, you now know about the existence of such data. If the accusation can prove that you read the article or knew about it and still, you did not delete the information, depending on which country you are, you can be criminally punished for having and disseminating child pornography.
The penalty for such a crime depends on the situation, but before being put in jail, your life would have ended because everyone you know, would then see you as a child-pornography lover... and that would definitely destroy your life.

So that I can sell it later, for a good profit. That's what it happens when the value rises very quickly. Investors see it as a profit-maker, not as a store-of-value. 
A store-of-value means the value remains the same, for a long period of time. It does not rises, it does not fall. It stays the same. 
Clearly, this did not happen with Bitcoin and financial investors took advantage of it.

You can't. The amount of transactions would simply create too much interference for the network to be usable. It would be like trying to talk to someone inside a room, filled with kids pumped on sugar and screaming. No one would hear you.
HAMs work because when someone talks, others listen. Also, you will not have lots of people talking at the same time. Add about 10K of people trying to transact at the same time, flooding messages into the air, and the network will blow up...


If you had a phoneline, you could simple dial-up to an ISP. Today, no internet means no communication whatsoever. That's how things work today. 


You can't. What you are talking about is routing in mesh-networks. The problem with mesh-networks is that they don't have a defined structure and  nodes can pop up and disapear at any time. You have protocols that work in small mesh-networks (AODV, BATMAN Adv, Netsukuku, to name a few), but the real problem is communication delay and network loops. Or you increase the delay to find on-demand a path through the mesh-network from node-to-node and hope the path still exists when you send the transaction, or you keep broadcasting routing tables through the entire mesh-network and hope it doesn't sucks up all the links bandwidth.


Without a centralized internet like the type we have today, the Bitcoin transaction protocol is useless as a currency. Image have to telegram to the world a transaction and wait one day for confirmation, every time you bough a coffee. It would be hilarious!

What I can say is that Bitcoin is just getting more and more entrenched in the world.

I've been working and developing code for linux-enabled distributions for more than 15 years.
The fact that it is open source, does not make it distributed.
Someone who claims that software open source is distributed, is an idiot, an ignorant, demonstrating only that it does not know what the word distributed even means.
Every large, complex software is programmed by very large teams.
The core development team for the Linux kernel is actually very small. Not all of the code is accepted and Linus is notoriously well know for his rants against those who think they know how to code, when trying to submit shit. 
And BTW, for those who think Linux is an Operative System... it is not. It is a Kernel. Learn the differences.

Due to the its nature of having a limit of 21 Million BTC, this means BTC will increase in value, with the increased demand. 
If bitcoin reaches 1 Million USD (perfectly plausible), then 1 satoshi would worth $10 USD.

Yes but, the fees were already low before coinbase and bitfinex implemented segwit support, so... I dont know if it will demonstrate much.
A big majority of the clients from those exchanges, don't even transfer their coins to their private wallets. They are just kept in the exchanges, because they are seen as an investment, rather than a currency. 
It will certainly help with the deployment of the Lightning Network, when it reach a state that it is considered bullet-proof, but I myself am more interested in knowing how their path exploration algorithm will work with the node increase.

But anyway, you want a better crypto? Monero and Digibyte. 
They both have what you want, they just are less adopted, which is normal since they are younger. 
Oh yeah, and Monero is actualy anonymous! It seems that it wasn't complicated to achieve... Go figure...
Digibyte is stronger against 51% attacks, just because instead of just using one hashing algorithm, they actually use 5 different hashing algorithms for mining, preventing centralization...
Oh, what about the transaction confirmation? 1.5 minutes compared to BTC 1 hour? Fast!
Number of transactions on chain per second? 280! Beat that BTC with your lame 2.5 per second...
Go back to your (centralized) Lightning network... just don't expect it to work well with more than 100K of nodes, with a truly mesh structure... because if you knew anything about routing packets in mesh networks, you would know that it's a pretty tough thing to do...

Yes it does. Bitcoin actually has around 3% of inflation per year. This is the amount of bitcoin being injected into the market every year.

It all depends up to its market value. The intention is to deflate infinitely. Since Bitcoin is capable of being divided infinitely, with the proper hard-forks, you could simply continue to subdivide the coin. Currently the smallest unit is considered to be 1 satoshi. 1 BTC is equal to 10000000  Satoshis. 
An hard-fork could provide an upgrade so that even a single satoshi could be subdivided.

That is a misconception. You don't need to block the Bitcoin network. You just need to block the users from connecting to it, in this case, the internet users from Venezuela.
So, unless every retailer/client has access to the TOR network or to an external to Venezuela VPN service, you may be prevented to connect to the Bitcoin Network.
Edit: by just blocking TCP traffic using ports 3333,8332,8333 and 18333, you will be able to block client access to a shitload of nodes.

No, not really.
When you see at bitfinex, lots of 0.5 sell orders, one after another, those are bots issuing lots of orders. Sometimes, we can even see them issuing multiple 20, 50 or even 100 sell limit orders, when their bots see visible buy orders of equal value, at specific levels.
Whales don't issue market sell orders. They issue lots of small limit orders. It's a way of controlling the sell price, in order to draw the most liquidity from the market. 
They also don't sell everything at once. They sell in batches and then wait. Sometimes, they even mislead the market, by issuing buy orders to raise the value, so that pigs think that the dip is reversing and start issuing buy orders at a higher price due to FOMO. I call this fattening the pig before the slaughter.
Then, they sell some more...
Bulls make money

There aren't standard indicators, but generally, it's when something does not actually makes sense, like a rally in the price, with very low volume (weak candles). This is usually done to give the traders, the sensation that the price is rallying, when it's not. 
Usually this is done by bots, and bots are very good at antecipating patterns. They usually short them or manipulate the market price with high frequency tradding, misleadding the tradders to buy, when they should do nothing.

I'm not talking about datacenters nodes.
I'm talking about GPUs. There's a difference between using lots of CPUs and using lots of GPUs. Big big difference in the hashrate.
*But GPUs are much less evenly distributed, so the generated coins only go towards rewarding 20% of the people for joining the network instead of 100%.
I don't mean to sound like a socialist, I don't care if wealth is concentrated, but for now, we get more growth by giving that money to 100% of the people than giving it to 20%. Also, the longer we can delay the GPU arms race, the more mature the OpenCL libraries get, and the more people will have OpenCL compatible video cards.*
He talks about users using GPUs at a later date, but has we see today, GPUs are no longer used, because ASICs have taken the market. Satoshi didn't predict that. Today, in order to mine with profit, ASICs are necessary and the profit must be obtained in less than 6 months, otherwise, it may not be possible to accompany the technological evolution. 
This also creates the issue of mining centralization, since the initial investment is out of reach for the large majority of people.

Well, that's the thing. Most of the BTC fan-boys believe that other cryptos rise, because their value is established by being paired with Bitcoin. In my opinion, that is far from the truth.
By analysing the charts at Bitfinex, when market pumps happen, they usually happen in all the cryptos, sometimes before bitcoin is pumped, sometimes after.
I honestly don't believe that other cryptos value is correlated to the bitcoin value in USD. In my opinion, this is just traders dispersing investment through several cryptos pairs, in order to access the maximum liquidity, so that when it is time to get the profit out, they are able to do so without completely crashing the market and hence, maximizing their short-term profit.
To conclude, in my opinion, professional traders don't have a special relationship with Bitcoin. They only care about the daily high-trading volume in each crypto trading pair, and make their investments accordingly. 


Most-likely yeah.

A dynamic adjustment after every mined block would not work, because you need an average to be effective. Like I previously (tried) to explain, blocks aren't mined after an exact time. They are each mined in average, every 10 minutes. The more blocks in the calculation universe, the smaller the standard deviation error will be, from the average value.
If you reduce the number of blocks used to input the difficulty algorithm, then instead of having a more precise transition from one difficulty level to another, you could end up to have a difficulty value update with a higher standard deviation from the average value, up or down in very short periods of time.
In the end, it is all about equilibrium between the time it takes to adjust the difficulty value and how precise should the next difficulty value be.
As an exercise for you to better understand this, do this. Go grab the time it took to mine each of the last 10 thousand blocks and then calculate the average time and the standard deviation error it took to mine each block with the following samples:
- For the total 10 thousand blocks
- For the last 5000 blocks
- For the last 2016 blocks
- For the last 1000 blocks
- For the last 500 blocks
- For the last 100 blocks
Compare the values and the errors.

That is a good question.
When Bitcoin first appeared, everyone saw it as the only cryptocurrency in the world. Today's reality is very different from 2009. There are a few dozens of cryptos which are now accepted for payments. Bitcoin is no longer the only player in town.
Won't people just hodl? Well... that is a big incentive, but you have to eat and drink, right? Pay the bills, etc. One way or another, you will have to spend money to buy stuff you need. You will have a big incentive to save, but there will also be need to spend some money to fullfill your daily needs.
This is all, of course, assuming that BTC will be the only one, which current facts begin to contradict.
Currently, people hodl, because they have the incentive of value appreciation, and they spend instead their USD/EUR/JPY/GBP, for example.
But I'm now currently very sceptical about all the crypto ecosystem. From the moment that merchants are accepting multiple cryptos, will we trully have a crypto-scarcity? Bitcoin value speculation is based on it's 21M limit. But from the moment there's a large amount of cryptos being accepted, do we truly have that limit? I'm beginning to question that.

The problem with these transactions is that miners will prioritize transactions with higher fees. If there's a surge in transactions, like what the network is having now, chances are the transactions with lower fees will be left behind :/

Depends which school. But most likely yes.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:55:17


no we won't. That's why the difficulty algorithm exists in the first place. It adjusts the difficulty so that the network outputs the same average amount of mined blocks, independently of the total network hashrate. 
**The network hashrate does not affect the amount of mined blocks in the middle or long term. Only in the short term (best case, during the next 2016 mined blocks).**
If the network looses hash power, the difficulty algorithm reduces the mining difficulty, making it easier to discover blocks. If the network hashrate increases, the mining difficulty is increased, making it harder to discover blocks.
So, **the transaction fees will not increase if the network looses hash power**.
What increases is the possibility of a 51% attack by a mining pool, since if a large miner shuts down it's mining operations, the balance of the hash power ratio is affected, and the biggest miner will see it's hash ratio increase.
The current trend is for the network hash power to rise and with it, the power consumption.

The same happens with Bitcoin.
You need to eat and drink to live, so you would still have to spend. If your paycheck is barely enough to pay for your daily needs, then you won't be able to save for difficult times, which will inevitably come.
With the bitcoin deflationary system, the paycheck of a worker will inevitably fall over time. If the worker paycheck deflates quicker than the value of Bitcoin, the worker will be at a loss and the employer will be at a win. 
Bitcoin will be stuck in a deflationary cycle, were the workers will continuously receive less and less for their work, and the employers will be able to keep and save more and more. Rich will be richer, the poorest will become even more poorer.
This is not a problem of having an inflationary or a deflationary system. This is a problem created by the wealth distribution and by the control over the access to knowledge, which has been limited through the privatization of schools and the continuously degradation and destruction of the fabrics of the society, by TV Shows from the likes of Alex Jones and Fox News, who spread mass panic through those who never had access to a quality school system.

The cheapest source of electricity is Coal, not solar. Good solar panels are expensive to manufacture and only work when there's day-light. Their performance is still low, but improvements have been made in the last 10 years.
Hidro-plants cannot be used when some smart-ass wants to, specially during summer and during dry seasons. Most water in dams is used for human consumption and farming.
Wind power plants only work when there's wind in specific conditions and in continued supply. A wind turbine costs energy to be powered up (it sucks energy from the network). To turn them on, the constant wind supply needs to remain for some time, otherwise it will not break-even.
The European Union along with other European countries, buy and sell energy between them, prioritising the most power-efficient sources with lower CO2 production. It's a fine balance.

Depending on what cryptocurrency we look, they could have different values, because not all of them can be used in a generic way.
Still, the majority of the cryptos value is still very speculative.
Bitcoin economy for example, is still a drop in the enormous world economic ocean. There's no way that the current Bitcoin value reflects the real bitcoin economy and so, Bitcoin is currently valued by the belief that the future Bitcoin economy will be enormous, creating a high demand for coins.
Currencies aren't tied to local economies in a direct sense. 
The reason why one British Pound is worth more than one US Dollar, is because of the British pound liquidity. For you to buy goods in the United Kingdom, you need to buy them using British Pounds. That alone, creates the demand to buy British pounds at the market, using other currencies, such as the USD, or the Euro, or the Japanese Yen.
Market demand establishes different values, when pairing different currencies.
What truly makes a currency stable, is the belief that the market has regarding its capability to maintain a stable value, for a very long period of time. High inflation rates destroys a currency trust, because the holders of that currency will loose the appeal to maintain it, developing the incentive to exchange this currency for another one more stable.

It's a competition game.
A miner has the need to increase it's mining hashrate position, mainly because if he doesn't, soon or later, the others will.
By increasing the hashrate, the cost to mine a bitcoin will also increase.
In my opinion, this is a problem because for miners to maintain their mining operations, they will need to sell bitcoins at a higher cost. 
If no demand for bitcoin exists, miners will be forced to sell at a loss or, to shutdown their most unprofitable rigs. 
Btw, the network hashrate is doubling at an incredible speed (every 3 months).

longs and shorts is the kind of strategy you establish when trading. If you open a long position, it means that you have acquired the asset with the intention of maintaining it for a very long time. A short is the same, but for a short period of time. 
Leveraged trading or margin trading, in this context, is when you use a small amount of money to control a big amount of crypto. For example, to open a margin position at Bitfinex, you need to transfer funds from your trading wallet to your margin wallet. The amount of money in your margin wallet, will allow you to get leveraged by borrowing up to a specific amount of money from the market, the other investors who will lend it to your, for an interest over an amount of time. This is your contract. You borrow, to pay back until the expiration date plus interests.
The money in the margin wallet is the collateral.
Now, this is were it gets interesting (dangerous). If you lend a big amount of money from the market to buy crypto and, if your crypto position gets eroded quickly (loses value) and the money in the margin wallet is not enough to cover the losses, you will get margin-called (liquidated) and your crypto positions will be sold at market value to cover the losses. Why? Because Bitfinex gives priority to those who lend you the money. 
Lending money at Bitfinex is a win-win situation, because it will always provide interests. Margin positions, can provide incredible profit, but it can also create great losses. 
See [here (Intro to Margin Trading)]( for more details.

The crash from 20K to 6K is very different from the crashes before. This time, lots of people got heavily burned and lots of early-adopters decided to cash out. This meant a lot of liquidity being taken out of the crypto market.
When you say


in my opinion, you are absolutely right.


Let me add some gasoline to that fire. 
I have been monitoring the Margin funding market at Bitfinex, and one thing I noticed, is that this last bull run from 6,8K to 9,7k, was mostly funded by margin funds. If money was borrowed, money has to be returned... with interests.


Honestly, early adopters with large amount of coins have most likely cashed out long ago, with an awesome profit. Who can blame them...
In order for the market to rise once again above the 20K, an incredible amount of cash needs to flow into the market. Now, will it all go into Bitcoin? That's not what the charts are showing...
In this last bull run, Bitcoin Cash was able to double its value. The same applies to Bitcoin Gold. Insane!
Call it alt-coins. Call it shit-coins. Call it speculation. It doesn't matter. Money is flowing into those cryptos and this is a fact. This is a very dangerous time to blindly invest your hard-earned money in the crypto market.

Yes, they are speculative and so is Bitcoin. Believing in otherwise, is being naive.
Many of the top50 cryptos can be used as currency with efficiency. There's nothing to stop it. Yes, Bitcoin was the first but I would never believe if a merchant would only accept one crypto... Why close his door to the rest of the market? That would make no sense.
For now, cryptos are being pumped just to FOMO people in. Why wouldn't they! Bitcoin Cash, 50% up in one week. Insane!
Bots pumping cryptos at Bitfinex, all at the same time, just to suck liquidity out of the market at a later time.
Yeah, I agree with you. It's all very very speculative.

Bitcoin market is too recent to make such judgements base on a yearly time scale.
My two cents is, this last rally is powered by Margin funds. In the last 48 hours, interest rates have been rising at Bitfinex for margin funds. Also, yesterday when it went above the 9K up to 9.7K, more than 30M USD were borrowed. 
So, to me, this has all been a rally of pure-speculation, which professional traders are very well capable of taking advantage.

You have to put in consideration how people were seeing bitcoin back then.

I was answering to his comment regarding using BitPay card.
My argument regarding using bitcoin as a currency is perfectly valid. 
If I keep my bitcoin and spend my fiat, I will be keeping my best performing asset while spending my worst performing asset. It's a perfectly valid option. At the end of the month, my fiat value will be the same at best, or loose value at worse. On the other hand, bitcoin has a high probability of becoming more valuable. 
Since the only way for me to spend Bitcoin in my daily life, is to exchange it for Fiat, there's no valid reason to do it. I'll just keep my Bitcoin and look at it as an investment asset and not as a currency.

Actually, there's an entity called  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) who could be considered the owner of the internet, since ISP's have to coordinate with this entity, in order to provide access to the Internet to their customers. 
IANA also keeps a record for the registration of network protocols IDs, valid Top-Level Domain Names and also has other responsibilities.
So, without IANA, the internet has we know it would not be possible.

Completely true. consumerism is a major plague. But does not mean that people are poor because of consumerism. It's not true at all.


Completely false. Absolutely and utterly false. I live in an European country, devastated by austerity, where the minimum wage is less than €600 per month. Tell me. Is it possible to live with €600 per month in the USA? I think not. 
I can guarantee to you that a factory manager makes sure that every single worker will work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. There's no thing such as *"I will work less hours because I already earn enough."* Try to do that in a factory, and I can guarantee it to you that you will be fired in the next day. 
It's completely false that innovation and technology helps to curb this issue. It's the other way around. With our level of technology, we should have already be living by only working 5 hours a day, and yet, there's constant pressure by managers, who themselves are pressured by stock-holders, to create profit and to respond to impossible-to-meet growth demands.
These managers will tell you in the face that if you want to go anywhere in your life, family is not an option in the company. The company is your new family. They will incentivise you to live in the company. They will shove *"gamified incentives"* such has *virtual badges* so that you keep a young and naive mind, and don't notice the years passing by. Goodbye family. Goodbye society.
These stock-holders, these so called *"entrepreneurs"* who never gave a single f*ck to create a company from ground, who never worked a single f*cking day in their lives and got everything from their mommies and daddies and were born in a golden craddle, these f*ckers are the ones who want more. 
These are the ones who called themselves libertarians and fight for lower taxes. These are the ones responsible for destroying society, just to get their short-term profit. Do they need the money? NO! Why do they do it? Because these f*ckers are junkies for power. They want the power to control society. Nothing more! 
And my biggest concern is that they have already taken over the crypto currencies world and may well be the biggest whalers out there, pumping and dumping into the market, extracting liquidity and making sure that their useful idiots are out there, convincing others to HODL their coins, while sucking their money and time...

He is not talking about exchanges. He is talking about opening channels between peers.
And yes, paths are incredibly hard to find, since you need a way to avoid loops in networks of which a peer knows little about it.
Also, It only takes one node from the path to go offline, and the entire channel is useless. That will trigger a new search for a newly available and well funded channel. Now multiply this by thousands of nodes, going online and offline... Complex issue.


Because you don't have the knowledge in real time, when a node is online or offline, unless you *"centralize"* the network in a bunch of *"bank"* nodes.


Unless it has been discussed in this context, you won't find any. Still, it is a well-known algorithm problem, studied in every decent and worth-taking CS degree.

If a miner increases his hashrate, he increases the chances of finding a block. This means a bigger share of the discovered blocks in a day. 
More blocks, more coins, more profit. 


That's the market value. At this precise moment, it's at 9250. Tomorrow it could be 10K or 6K. Market value is a different story.
I think you mean, with the increase of the network hashrate, if the market value remains constant, the profitability is reduced.
@_date: 2018-04-12 10:41:09
Good point. Although there's many type of gears (cheaper and expensive) and not all types of bicycles need it to work normally. 
Also, contrary to LN, gears have decades of proved demonstration and efficiency. LN is built on a premiss that it will simply work and scale without centralization, which I honestly doubt since if there's something which Mesh Network Protocols have taught us, is that scaling in unstructured networks is a very complex issue and currently unanswered. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:54:38
No. You misunderstood what the difficulty algorithm is for.
The objective of the difficulty algorithm, is to maintain the average of 1 mined block per 10 minutes. The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 mined blocks, so that it is increased or reduced, to maintain the average time interval of 10 minutes. 
When a miner increases his mining hashrate, he is increasing his share of the total network hashrate. By increasing his share, the miner increases his probability of discovering a valid block, and reduces the chances of the remaining miners to discover a valid block.
The only way for a miner to see his probability being reduced, is by either removing hashrate power from his side, or by having the remaining miners for the network increase their own hashrate.
[That is the reason why BTC.com is capable of discovering more blocks per day, than every other mining pool.]( It has more hashrate than the other miners.

You don't know if they are institutional players. They can be leveraged old-time traders, with deep pockets. 


No you cannot. First of all, just because a bar is green, doesn't mean all orders of that candle are buy orders. It is perfectly possible to have large sell orders, and then a tiny order being executed right after, at a price market above the open session value. That would cause the candle to turn from red to green, creating the idea that someone decided to buy lots of coins, when the it was actually someone who decided first, to sell lots of coins, ending up to be exploited by a bot which saw his sell order.


And that is why millions have been borrowed from the margin market at Bitfinex in the last 48 hours, just to pump up the market and create FOMO along the amateur investors. This is how pigs get slaughtered.
Institutional Investors don't buy blindly (market orders),  and they **never, ever** reveal their position. Don't expect an institutional investor to issue visible orders or market orders, unless when it is to exploit the market and move it in a very specific direction. There are algorithms specifically built just to execute these movements.
PS: I did not meant to be aggressive in any way with my comments. 
PS2: It is my opinion that the crypto-market is being leveraged with borrowed money. I have the feeling that Bitfinex itself is doubling their profits by borrowing the money they get from the transaction fees. They are just cycling the money.

What is worse is that the countries population is now reducing and consequently there are geographical locations which once were filled with populated villages, are now completely empty.
Also, the young generations are being forced to meet impossible daily objectives by their managers, because those managers are also being pressured by the  share-holders to maintain impossible growth ratios.

The only way for transactions to be batched, is to have one transaction to many. Yes, it's true that batching transactions reduced the number of confirmed transactions on-chain. But it also proves that the majority of transactions are outgoing transactions. Maybe people hoarding or bots arbitraging. Take your pick.
If Bitcoin usage as a currency was growing, you would see the number of transactions of chain also growing, because bitcoin users would be making transactions of 1-to-1, not 1-to-many at the same time, like trading platforms do.

I have seen libertarians shouting that they wanted freedom to do what ever they wanted, when freedom itself has explicit boundaries. You call out against big corporations, but those corporations were once small ones who grew to be big. Bitcoin is not going to change that, at all. It will probably make it even worse, due to all the whalers out there, with their massive piles of Bitcoins, giving them the capacity to pay and control.
See, that is the dreamers vision. The idea that with Bitcoin, everything is going to be well and awesome. I prefer the realistic approach and that is why I'm here. To make the aggressive and provocative questions.

If you have some knowledge about HTTP queries, you can use blockchain HTTP API to query their service about a block info. [See here](
The Blockchain API can provide you information, in a JSON structure, about a block. In that information structure, you will also find the signature of the previous block. It's just a matter of implementing a cycle to query the reception time of the last 10K blocks. Then you just need to see the time delay between each block, and you will have the time it took to discover the block.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:38:09

Bears can mine to just sell. Bulls buy to keep and at some point, they may have the incentive to become bulls and sell. Bears may also buy at a lower value, to short the crap out of the bulls at some point.

Honestly, I don't believe in the crypto currencies market.
There are pump &amp; dump schemes, wash trading, inside trading, currency manipulation (USDT), not to mention babies (HODLR's) behind their keyboards, afraid of going outside, who don't known jack shit of how this world works. They see the price going up and think massive adoption has arrived. They see the price going down, they think about FUD and give excuses how Bitcoin is under attack, without ever considering that this is how a crypto market behaves... full of speculation and probably the biggest bubble in the human history.
1 in 3 south Koreans have investments in the crypto market, not because they want to use crypto currencies, but because they saw in it, the way to finally own a house our getting rich quickly...

@_date: 2018-04-19 23:32:34


Yes it is. I will explain it.


You mean, supermarkets, large-sized retailers? They cannot use Bitcoin. It's simple as that. Every payment needs to issue a selling bill for tax reasons. Failing to do so, can get them into big trouble.
To issue a selling bill, they need to receive a payment in Euros, since Bitcoin is not recognized as legal tender.
Maybe small retailers, but I don't shop in those because they have nothing I need or because they are more expensive. But even in those, there's the issue of the age.
Shops which are managed by elder people, are a no-go. Where I live, elder people are very distrustful of new-tech. They prefer live-cash. most of those retailers don't even accept debit/credit cards.
This also takes out small groceries local markets, since most of them are also managed by older folks. 
Then there's the distrust in what Bitcoin is. I have found to be very common, for millennials to distrust Cryptocurrencies. They see it more as gambling.
The only thing I'm remembering is online shopping for computer hardware. When Steam was accepting Bitcoin, I wanted to use Bitcoin to buy some games, but the fees... the fees killed me. Too bad Steam doesn't accept Bitcoin anymore. It would help there.
Hey, not everything is bad! At least, Bitcoin is not taxed here. If I sell every bitcoin I have, no taxes will be applied.

It is impossible for the food industry to be in a free-market, for the simple reason that you need land to produce food. Land is a limited, scarce commodity with specific properties that depend upon its location, which once it is obtained, it is removed from the market.

I'm being realistic. Realistic people achieve realistic objectives. Dreamers in the other hand... keep on dreaming. 


Because little can be learn by just agreeing with others ideas. It is during debate and discussion that realistic plans are born. Aiming for the moon is good yes, but if the rocket is not solid, it will fell apart in mid flight.
When I'm talking about adoption, I'm being realistic, not pessimistic. I see an issue to be resolved. I choose not to ignore it. I choose not to segregate people, just because they are distrustful about a new system. I opt to mold the system to adapt to those who wish to use it and create a path, which people around me will feel comfortable in following.
I'm not a fanatic. I understand that Bitcoin can still fail spectacularly. I see the issues and the problems ahead. That is being realistic and it's a step towards being successful.

There's no indication that 50% of the network hashrate will be lost. Everything points in the oposity direction.
It doesn't matter which manufacturers enter the race. You have to see the physical implications. The antminers platforms use a 14nm gate technology. There's a physical limit around the 7nm-5nm gate size and even CPUs aren't there yet. 
Even if antminers started to use a 7nm gate manufacturing process, it is only a 50% reduction in chip size, which could reflect in a 2x hash power increase per chip at max in the next 2 years!
The bitcoin network hashrate has more than trippled in the last 6 months! The hardware development simply cannot provide with the necessary increase in hashrate using the same ammount of energy, which means energy consumption will increase and with it, the energy bill.

In a bitcoin economy, borrowing Bitcoins would be extremely difficult, specially during high deflationary times. 
Think this. If you borrowed X Bitcoins from someone, and you agreed to pay that someone the X bitcoins back, plus an interest, if the economy suddenly jumped and Bitcoin entered in a steep deflationary moment, you could go easily bankrupted because it would become very difficult for you to pay back the same amount of Bitcoin, plus interests.
The borrowing contracts would have to presume these steep moments, so that the *"value"* and not the amount, would be what you paid back.
A Bitcoin economy assumes once again, a country could go bankrupt, like it happened during several periods in the History of European Governments, when a kingdom could not pay their debts in gold. Sometimes, it meant war and devastation.

Usually, those who do that, are the ones who have already secured enough money and investments to live the rest of their lives without having to worry about how to pay their rent. 
When its those situations, I feel no empathy because there's really no effort. Yeah, they might be trying to create something great, but they don't put their neck on the line, like so many volunteers or low-pay workers.
Just my two cents, but I'm usually very distrustful when it's about money. Greed is a powerful motivator so it is difficult to distinguish those who really want to do something good, from those who are just their to pick a fat paycheck.

Ah yes, I have seen his talks. Big Fan. But I believe that, when he mentions millennial in the workplace", he mentions the issues of bad parenting which created the illusion of being special just because they exist.
He also mentions one thing very important, which is the fact that a big majority of millennials have zero patience and zero persistence. They want quick success and short-term reward, which does not come easy or doesn't come at all in the real world.
Because of that, a big chuck of the millennials end up learning the hard way that real success, takes a life time to achieve. Most millennials don't understand this because they spend their lives receiving the so called, instant gratification, experiencing little to none, the difficulties and challenges of the real life.

@_date: 2018-04-08 18:00:20
No it is not. You are wrong.
Let me teach you.
The bitcoin protocol applies the dificulty algorithm every 2016 mined blocks, increasing the dificulty to maintain a more or less average constant output of mined blocks per time unit.
If the number of mined blocks increases, the dificulty increases. Since adding more hashpower into the network increases the probability of discovering a block, then the number of mined blocks increases, that is, until the dificulty algorithm kicks in.
By addindg more hashrate to the network, the energy consumption increases, which means more money needs to be spent on energy.
So, Bitcoin mining costs increases.
Bitcoin network hashrate has trippled in the last six months. Hardware advancement is not capable of increasing the hashrate using the same energy, with the same ratio of growth of the network hashrate.
It is simple to understand. The more hash power is added to the network, the more energy is consumed, which reflects in increased mining costs.
If miners do not keep adding hashrate into their pools, their profit will decrease over time because other mining pools will increase their hashrate and see their chances of discovering blocks increase.

Right... Because a seller will not increase the price as soon as it sees buyers buying frenetically...
You'r assumption is simply wrong.

The mere existence of Bitcoin will not resolve unemployment. You have to remember that human society lived centuries under a gold-standard economy. Was it a fair society? No. Was it a free society? Absolutely not.


Economy is created by people for people, not by numbers. You have to trust people if you want a trustworthy economy.

Yes, that is perfectly valid. But I wonder how the market will react once Bitcoin start's to become more scarce. Will the market simply turn its attention to other cryptos? It is very plausible in my opinion.
It is also plausible that the crypto market could entirely collapse and we are just in the biggest bubble in the human history.
Either way, it will be awesome to watch it in person.

Darknet sites don't, but transactions need to.
Regarding the Lightning Network, lets wait to see how successful it will be. I don't want to comment a lot about it because honestly, I have yet to read the draft paper (yes, it is still a draft).

Btw, check this -&gt;  "Identifying Proxy Nodes in a Tor Anonymization Circuit"

It doesn't work like that. 
One thing is amateur radio, another is having a network with enough bandwidth to support fast transactions.
Even today's networks can barely support that with centralised regulations (IANA), let along amateur networks with AM radios and stuff like that...
It's fucking complex...

Nuclear proof bunkers -&gt; Expensive cofins...
Those always remember me of US Americans buying nuclear bunkers with big ass TVs inside... lol Like they would be watching anything after a nuclear detonation nearby...

the qrcode is valid. the addresses within are not. :) 
At least, that was what blockchain.info reported.

In a TOR network, the exit nodes can see your information and track you. Rogue exit nodes can spy your information and in this case, track your bitcoin transactions.
The best way would be to "VPN" directly to validation nodes/miners and directly give to them your transaction. But this would be impractical for regular daily life, since it would require a different VPN per validation node/miners. But this is me speculating.
Regarding your offchain transactions question, I quote bitcoin wiki
"The "transaction" happens by the act of agreeing that the debt exists, and the validity of it is based solely on the trust that one friend has in the other. " -&gt;

This is a research project which means the publications will be available for the public.
What you should fear is the private companies associated with this project. Those are the ones who usually hide all relevant information.

So, by selling ethereum, you are also selling bitcoin? 
This is worse than inception!

Libtards will always be tards...

That's the estimated time, based that the hash rate keeps growing as predicted. 
It is not written in stone and if quantum computers or some other tech is capable of mining at higher speeds than the originally estimated, then the end will be earlier.
Still, you answered my question. Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:43:25
What would happen to the transactions starting from that mined block and their respective fees if a miner "dropped dead"? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:50:55
Hmm, that is the same explanation for the HFT which is stalling the Gold value.

LibTards - abreviation to Libertarian Retards
In other words, libertarians who are completely obsessed but not limited to, the "New World Order", the "next Nuclear war" and "how buying a nuclear shelter, guns, ammo and gold is so important for your survival".
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:37:27
I see. Didn't know that!
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:57:09
Btw, if they keep receiving fees, are they capable of increasing those same fees if they want to? What would keep them from doing that?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:55:57
When all the bitcoins are mined, what happens to miners?
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:28:22
TOR is not 100% anonymous... not even close. 
Off-chain transactions may not be fulfilled by one of the parts, which means a greedy person can easily con another one. They are also impractical for the daily use.
On the other hand, Stealth addresses are interesting and may be a good way to introduce true anonymous transactions. Still, you have the communication issue which can be always be spied by a counter-intelligence agency.
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:51:50
Yes, but I'm talking about the transaction fees. 
If a miner gets to receive the fees from a mined block, then what happens if the miner ceases to exist?
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:18:35
You have a voice. It doesn't mean everyone will listen or follow you, just because you want to.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:54:02
No good. In such scenario, there would be no communications available, because they would be destroyed by nuclear magnetic impulses.
No communications, no transactions.

Embracing arts is good and there's nothing wrong about it.
Its just... there no need to take a degree about it. You can learn about everything as an Hobby. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:38:40
So, in order to collect transaction fees, it is necessary to mine at least one block?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:02:49
yes it is

And that is why books costed so much in those times. Only the rich and powerfull had access to education because of that.
