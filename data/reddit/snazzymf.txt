If every piece of money in the world is in bitcoin, then sure, you're at your maximum. The value of bitcoin would only increase at that point as there's no currency to compare to bitcoin and some gets irrecoverably lost here and there. At this theoretical maximum there is no room for alt coins. 
I'm not sure I understand the question.

Yeah bet but we're talking about now. The dude's trying to say that these big transactions today are banks somehow trying to manipulate the market down. That doesn't make any sense. 
On a sidenote, the reason that the price is running up so much is probably because of speculation on the effects of opening derivatives.

To be fair the bearish article was before the launch of futures and the bullish was after. Cramer thought Short sellers were going to crush bitcoin when futures launched. They didn't and he called it a major victory for Bitcoin. I don't think he's being disingenuous.

Because people here think that all the wallstreet short selling boogeymen are going to get them. Much more likely is an influx of institutional money once they are able to hedge their position with shorts and futures. Also, brokerages like TDAmeritrade will probably support futures trading for bitcoin, increasing penetration.People have been predicting these two things and that's why the price has gone up.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:39:19
Short term it could go up too, now that institutional investors have a way to hedge their risk.

Dude's smart, he's more than entitled to his opinion. Just because he happened to be wrong about Bitcoin doesn't mean that you should invalidate everything he says. He was pretty on point in 2007/2008 with the housing crisis.
He's not known for backing high risk or highly speculative investments and from his view that's exactly what Bitcoin is. Can't fault him for not becoming a crypto evangelist.

Nah, the FDIC insures those because they're in actual bank accounts with real banks registered with the FED. They have separate private insurance on all digital currencies.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:45:44
Crypto currency is not fiat, which is why it is covered by Lloyd's of London and not the FDIC. 
Sure they're not going to cover you if the breach is on your end, but 'hackers managing to override Coinbase's intact security protocols' would certainly constitute a breach of Coinbase's cyber security which would be covered. As long as the breach is on their end, you're covered. That was at least my reading of it. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:09:07
What you linked only indicates that they don't insure your individual account against getting hacked, not that they don't insure your coins stored offline. They only have 2% online at a time to minimize risk. They insure all customer funds in the event of a breach or employee theft.

Most loans have collateral, in most cases the non-cash asset that the loan helped to purchase. If you fail to make good on your mortgage, the bank has the right to reclaim your house and take its equity out of it.
I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around capital destruction through the financial system. If a natural disaster comes and wipes out infrastructure, sure, that's capital destruction. But what if the housing market fell and someone cant pay their mortgage? Then the bank can only get a fraction of its loan amount out. Banks employ appraisers to mitigate this risk, but it does happen. The bank lost money on the loan and the borrower lost their house. But that loss is to the gain of the original seller of the house, who puts his money into property, or investments, or some productive asset. Thus that capital only changes hands and finds its way back into the system.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:04:10
Wtf? *The financial system is debt*. The financial system is the system by which borrowers and creditors are linked. You deposit money in a bank, that money gets lended out, and you indirectly lend someone money for their house. This is a much more efficient system than everyone saving up cash for every purchase. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:17:37
Not even at some level. It's in the name. The value of a *derivative* is *derived* from another asset. Everyone in this thread is treating derivatives as some sort of financial boogieman and it's the most asinine bullshit I've ever heard.
Derivatives have a variety of uses but by far the most common is to hedge against risk and uncertainty. Futures contracts are an example of a derivative. The idea is that if you're holding your shares and want to eliminate risk of them going down, you would sell a contract where another party is going to buy X number of shares at Y price on Z date. If the price rises above Y, the party that purchased your shares can buy them from you at a lower price and sell them at market. If the price falls below Y, you get to sell your shares above market. Either way, you've created certainty in the sale price of your shares and are immune to the market's fluctuations. This also applies in a more practical way to commodities contracts. If you're buying soybeans for your tofu plant and want to ensure a steady price regardless of seasonal harvests, you buy soybean futures.

Lmao obviously everyone's aggregated debt is going to be greater than the amount of money in the world. The vast majority of the assets of any given bank are receivables from loans issued. Should they just keep everyone's deposits in big vaults underground? How would they make money? Fees?
That's how the economy works. Money is just a means of exchange and can change hands as much as it needs. You buy a 300k house and take out a mortgage, congratulations, you're 240,000 in debt on your mortgage. Are you supposed to have all the cash on hand to cover the mortgage at any given time? In that case what's the point of the mortgage in the first place? You have a 300,000 asset, but that's not in cash. Debt is used to finance non-cash assets.

Have you heard of Japan's economic crisis? Spending makes the economy go round, holding cash just stagnates it. When you buy a good you are contributing to the demand for it, encouraging the production of that good and literally growing the economy.

And holding physical cash... does? How so? Growth in the economy is a measure of goods produced, money is just a means for measuring it. The Keynesian model may not be perfect but how are you arguing with supply and demand? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:18:25
Science and mathematics should be our basis of thought, I agree. However, you can't pretend that either one has reached a conclusion about precisely what constitutes the self. The only discussion we can have is purely philosophical. 
I would argue that yes, yes the change is different than the change brought on by a good night's sleep, precisely because it is not a change at all. It is a Xerox. It is the difference between writing a novel, let's call it *The Story of Your Life*, going back a page, crossing out some words, writing a new word at the end, all while keeping the book in its original form versus scanning the whole book into a computer, only instead of it being stored in the language it was originally written in, it is translated into Klingon. The newly scanned version has all the contents of the original, minus some lost in translation, but it doesn't have the cover art, it doesn't have the paper. You can read it, but you can't touch it or interact with it in a way more meaningful than simply reading it. What is saved is the information, nothing more. Many people believe that a human being is composed of more than simple information.
But of course the question there is whether, even if it is an absolutely perfect copy, somehow copying the intangible elements as well as the information, easily mistakable for the original, it is still not you. I still feel that the answer is no. A good litmus test l, in my view, is whether you, as you are now, can coexist with the new version of yourself. If you can, then how in the hell is that you?

I like Bitcoin as much as anyone here, but this is stupid. 
For investment purposes, Bitcoin is still highly speculative and could still fall quite significantly with any government measures to curtail its use. Stocks are priced according to fundamental value and expectations of future growth. Stocks, in aggregate, are always going to go up. As long as technology is improving and people are being born, economic output is increasing and there's upside to stocks. Even if you bought into everything just before the 1929 crash, 20 years later you're seeing gainz.
You can't have an economy without businesses, you can have one without crypto.

Hey, it's on the table. Approx. 27 billion USD is in bitcoin right now. Compare that to the $64 trillion in various fiat currencies around the globe. Bitcoin has a couple of orders of magnitude to increase in value if its use becomes commonplace.
But you're right, the biggest threat to it is the volatility driven by all of the speculation and profit-takers, especially now that institutional money is getting involved.
However, imo, that volatility will be hedged quite significantly over the next couple years as Japanese quantitative easing measures continue to devalue the Yen. Confidence in the Yen is already fairly low, and with Bitcoin as legal tender in Japan it's not unreasonable to anticipate a significant move from Yen to Bitcoin, increasing the functional demand for the currency and diluting the impact of institutional movers.
There's an overall move towards regulation too, as evidenced by both Japan and Russia. That trend should legitimize it in the eyes of more people and decrease the risks associated with unscrupulous wallet providers and fiascos like Mt. Gox. 
Once the kinks are ironed out, I think the potential is virtually unlimited.
Or it could go to 0. Idk.

I spent the last 10 minutes typing up a point by point reply but my POS browser crashed, so I'm sorry if this is a bit short.


This is a really good point and a good example of Theseus' Paradox. I would be myself if you replaced every neuron in my brain in precisely the same arrangement with a mechanical equivalent. I think that where we disagree is on what my self would be if we were to take those mechanical neurons and build an exact replica of my mind with them.
If you have two identical computers, with the same specifications, hardware, firmware, software, etc. are they the same computer? Is the second computer the same as the first? If you take the hard drive from the first on, copy it, and put it into the second one, is the second one now the first one or an exact copy of the first one?


Or are transporters in Star Trek inherently murdering people and leaving soulless copies elsewhere?
Outside of the story, why should you accept those characters as "the same person", after "transportation"?
I do believe that the transporter is killing the original person and creating an exact copy of them elsewhere, I'm pretty sure this exact idea was brought up on the show.


The question is whether the original and the copy *can* coexist, not whether they *do* coexist. This is the difference between your example of replacing the biological neurons of a neural network with artificial neurons and recreating that neural network elsewhere.

I put $150 in this morning and it's worth $170 right now. So sure, if you think it's going places, go for it. If it enters general use the limited supply means that there's nowhere to go but up. There's even talk of a $1,000,000 bitcoin 10 years from now. That'll make my $150 worth $90,000.
It's been rallying pretty hard because Japan approved it as legal tender, which I think paves the way for great potential in the future. The problem is that much of the current value is driven by speculation off of that rather than functional demand for the currency, which definitely over-inflates its value relative to the quantity demanded for actual transactional use. 
You just have to bet on whether or not crypto will beat the establishment. If it does, it's going to the moon.
