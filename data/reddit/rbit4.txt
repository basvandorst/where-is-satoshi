In the homeless shelter?

What decentralization? Wtf centralized mining, centralized power with few initial hodlers and miners, centralized wealth! Peck of chumps and retards following their massiah to their doom!
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:17:17
It's more likely regulation will kill Bitcoin and crypto!

Projected price beginning of 2020 is 2449. What are you smoking? Longforecast.com

Actually what happened above showed to the world how fickle and fuped crypto really is. When 2 people can change the way the world values Messiah currency after a fight, it shows how gullible everyone else reading Bitcoin is really. 4.1k now, down to 2k ftw!!

Son, that would be kubernetes. Bitcoin adopters don't actually contribute, only gamble. Its is swarmed by half wit folks trying to get rich quick, a very tiny fraction of Bitcoin supporters actually add value, by coding or have significant wealth.

BTW, why didn't you sell at 18k, and buy at 3.6k? Unrealized gains are still a loss, so you my friend lost 5x from the top. Don't fool yourself.
Take 4x free profit?

Centralized mining, centralized power with few initial hodlers and miners, centralized wealth! Pack of pooor chumps and retards following their massiah to their doom dreaming about being crypto millionaires.. make those burgers fast!
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:57:28
Sure some profits. But if I can't mine it, I don't buy it. majority of hodlers are in loss, while you count on them hodling to make you are profit.. You scheming a$$
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:35:10
&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp; do it, you will cry next week. If prices go down, you can loose a lot of money real fast&lt;/p&gt;
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:11:06
Nobody cares! For that matter the Venezuelan currency with the same logic is still solid even after million percent inflation.. you are very foolish
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:15:42
Yeah, stocks like Nvda which were crypto bulls.. lolz
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:44:18
What bogus crap, even if you think usd does go away to dust, there is no wealth transfer happening to fools like you. People will use property and non crypto assets to hodl their wealth from poor fellows like you.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:43:45
The difference this time around friend is that there are no more fools who will buy in due to fomo. All of them already lost their life savings giving the top 1% crypto holders their lambos. Guess you missed out and still hodled. +90% in value from today..hmm.. that is exactly the same.. it's sad to talk with folks who can't make an argument, and resort to kiddish jibes like learn to read, rofl. 
Again, how much did Charlie Lee sell his litecoin for??
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:16:19
Dollar lost 90% value over 150 years, it took crypto less than 1 year. So awesome huh buttcoiners? Decentralized.. is more centralized in wealth then North Korea you lame goose bag hodlers.. rofl!
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:20:55
Why don't you emmigrate to venenzuela and sell them some of the shitcoins.. the poor can loose some more money ��
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:18:53
Dollar lost 90% value over 150 years, it took crypto less than 1 year. So awesome huh buttcoiners? Decentralized.. is more centralized in wealth then North Korea you lame goose bag hodlers.. rofl! And how centralized is bitmain, much more then any central fing bank. Get back to flipping burgers!
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:26:34
Oh.. +90% from 3600 will be more than 20k? Math does not work like that. It needs it to grow by over 500%. Those days are gone and you sad bag holders now are on the hook. You know that 99% of crypto wealth was owned by 1% in 2017 and all of them cashed out. Charlee Lee sold all his litecoin in Dec 2017 at a above 300 a coin, isn't it now below 30??
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:45:21
Very likely lol
