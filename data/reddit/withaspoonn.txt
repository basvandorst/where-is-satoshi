I think part of his question was, what are the investors receiving in return for their investment, where is the ROI?
VCs and banks aren't known for giving away money in a charitable fashion to projects like this.

What alt, what idol.. I’m all in Btc &amp; Eth apart from what I got for free.

If they allow you to deposit via PayPal, how long are withdrawals held back?

If it’s for such small amounts I would probably use localbitcoins, or even a bitcoin atm.
Don’t meet anyone in person off localbitcoins and only use trusted sellers.

What on earth is SLL?
Steer clear.

Nothing recently it's been this absolute cesspool of shit for quite a long time now which I know you're full aware of.
I'm convinced the absolute least educated and experienced crypto enthusiasts frequent here now, it's pretty much just moon kids who post memes and parrot what ever the most upvoted person is saying.

That's not even remotely true.
They only charge gst on their commission.
