That! 
Before you downvote him, take off the bitcoin hats and think about what he said. Bitcoin alternatives for storing value are very common, every grandma knows some... That's a reality. For most common greeks or italians Bitcoin would be much too risky to invest in (even it might magically turn out as the most profitable investment they could do at that point). If you ask a common greek or italian on the street what he would prefer: Money in Bank, Bitcoins or bars of gold unter the mattress, what would he answer?
Don't get me wrong, I also like to see BTC prices rise, but don't be so naive to think that this is the start of the 100'000$ per Bitcoin era.

1. Save a copy of your wallet.dat
2. Install the original Bitcoin Core client
3. Start it and let the Blockchain data download
4. Stop it and replace wallet.dat with a copy of your old one.
5. Send em to another address you control the private key
6. Repeat for other Bitcoin clones if worth doing it.

And the more people use BTC it could take a while until your zero-fee-transaction will be processed.
I also consider it fair play if you add a fee. If you want a decentralized network, give miners an incentive to mine.

Thank you for your story. I can imagine how much that must hurt. I had similar lessons and learned:
* greed makes me blind
* don't buy into falling knives, just don't
* the higher the possible win, the higher the risk
* only because it worked once or twice, it doesn't mean it will work one more time
* get out fast if it's time to get out
* you can try hard, but you never can anticipate everything
* do not listen what others in the same boat say
* be aware that you overestimate possible chances and underestimate possible risks
I guess there are many more such rules...
Edit: added three more of my personal rules

Not sustainable in the sense that it brought new users or businesses to Bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption in Cyprus is very low and I think the all time high in price was attracting much more users (and speculators) than Cyprus.

@_date: 2015-06-29 12:07:51
Of course it works. But there are questions:
* what's the real price you can buy BTC for (incl. fees for obtaining them)?
* Can you take the risk of trading through localbitcoins?
* Can you take the risk of trading on BTC-E?
* Can you take the risk that prices may fall between buying and selling?
* Are there any buyers in your area?
* Are there any other sellers in your area?
* What value has your time?
* What's the margin you can reach on localbitcoins?

Man, I am sorry for your loss. Smells like foul play by your advisor. 
I am sure there are many parties trying to manipulate crypto prices, and maybe sometimes a few of them are successful, but I doubt there is a single party that fully controls the price the whole time.
One thing that I wonder is the role of Bitcoin futures. The CME futures started trading on December 18, 2017. And December 17 was the peak. If some people can dump and pump enough on the exchanges that are included in the CME price, they could possibly earn a fortune by trading futures or leveraged products .
This won't really, help you, I know.

1. Trustee sold ~36k BTC/BCH from December to February as he said.
2. He said he was selling it in a way that tried to avoid market movements, with the help of an exchange.
3. There is no proof that he sold more since then. He needs the courts permission to do so. There were movements, but no statements about effective sells by the trustee.
4. Some speculate, he might sell a few more to cover possible liabilities, eg the coinlab case.
5. Court soon has to decide about if the company will be taken out of bankruptcy (civil rehabilitation, CR), which would in the best case mean BTC would be distributed as BTC to the creditors.
6. If the court rejects this 'civil rehabilitation', the trustee could (not necessarily has to) sell the remaining coins and pay out the shareholders (Karpeles and Jeb McCaleb). Creditors would in this case get around 450$ per lost BTC, surplus would go to the shareholders.
7. Karpeles said that in case of 6. he would be willing to distribute the surplus to the creditors, but raises concerns that a huge part of it would be directly go to the japanese tax collectors.

If you have an Android phone you could use mycelium to import the private key. I am not sure if currently there are iPhone wallets (due to Apples anti-BTC attitude). 
Else in your blockchain wallet there should be an option to import the private key. Find it and type in the private key which I suppose is noted next to the Spend QR Code. Also in Bitcoin-qt there's an option to import a private key. Go to the console of the QT client and then type importprivkey followed by the private key. This works also with the command shell version (bitcoind).
Once imported successfully, just send the funds to a new address you generated in one of your clients (e.g. Bitcoin-qt.

Karpeles declaration is interesting. Eg:
*On February 7, 2014, all bitcoin withdrawals were halted by MtGox due to the theft or disappearance of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins owned by MtGox customers as well as MtGox itself. The cause of the theft or disappearance is the subject of intensive investigation by me and others -- as of the present time I believe it was caused or related to a defect or "bug" in the bitcoin software algorithm, which was exploited by one or more persons who had "hacked" the bitcoin network. On February 24, 2014, MtGox suspended all trading after internal investigations discovered a loss of 744,408 bitcoins presumably from this method of theft.*
He has no fucking clue. Or acts as con artist...

The title may be misleading. It does not seem that the NDB had the idea or is actually using BTC for anonymous transactions.
The only sidestory were Bitcoin is mentioned in the article is a powerpoint presentation that was found on a private detective's computer. The file named "Bitcoin Feb2014" was a plan showing ways how the Swiss Secret Service NDB could pay his foreign sources anonymously. In the article it says that a NDB agent asked a "hacker" for such a plan. 
Honestly, if you ask a hacker, how to transfer funds anonymously, what will he answer? Is anybody surprised that BTC could be used by secret services?

That's what the foundation always was, from day one. It was clear when it was founded, that it's a group of more or less shady bitcoin industry guys and that the aim was to help their businesses by eventually promoting Bitcoin. The foundation was never THE Foundation, it was just Mark Karpeles and his buddy's in my eyes.
The real foundation of bitcoin are (and had always been) it's github developers (which still seem to be an open community so far) and all it's worldwide users who slowly adopt Bitcoin in their local communities. We, the peers of Bitcoins, are the ones who take the decisions by selecting the client software we use. If someone wants to change bitcoin, he has to convince us - never forget that. We are THE Foundation.

They could limit BTC withdrawals in amount and time and hope that ppl will just forget soon and stay there.
They could also make trades free for a certain time. 
If the price shoots up because ppl want to withdraw BTC and gets higher than bitstamp, ppl might want to keep it in Gox.
I personally think they will surely limit the withdrawal amount, because they can't defrost their cold storage as fast as it would be necessary... (if they really have anything in storage)

Any efforts are welcome, but be aware that you might search for hours without finding something useful.
You could start with looking at the spikes in Days destroyed:  (Spikes in December, February and March). Please read on what Days-Destroyed really means. It's not necessarily the key in the MtGox case. You could also look for days with huge tx volumes.
Then go and find the blocks that were mined that days and look for the blocks with the highest volumes (like this one from December 21, 3013:  Then look through the transactions of this block for any tx chains linked to any known MtGox addresses.
Maybe other people have better ways...
Also be aware that "they" could have moved coins slowly but constantly during months, so you won't find any traces in the Days-Destroyed-Charts. That is very likely...

Did they do any serious lobbying (for Bitcoin itself, not for their companies)? When? Where? Did they really force software development with the donations they got (apart of paying one dev)? 
The only visible outcome of it are the various (former) exponents like Karpeles, who are continuously causing bad press for Bitcoin... 
That's not a foundation, that's a club or an association lobbying for their own businesses, not for Bitcoin. It lacks the unselfishness I'd expect of a foundation.

Fellow Redditors, please correct me if I am wrong: Assuming his Mom is not familiar with computers and the internet he could even set up the process by himself without having his mother to click around coinbase: 
1. DW40 sets up a coinbase account on behalf of his mother including payout to a bank account she owns
2. DW40 goes and buys Bitcoins in Turkey through localbitcoins or a turkish exchange ( ATTN: Find out if you can trust em)
3. DW40 makes a BTC transaction to his mom's coinbase BTC account
4. DW40 converts BTC on his moms coinbase account into $$$.
5. DW40 initializes $$$ payout on coinbase to his moms bank account
6. Mom goes to her bank to cash out into greenbacks
Did I miss a point? Maybe Mom does not have an US bank account? Or DW40 doesn't have a turkish bank account? What are the risks?

Of course could the text be manipulated server side. But if you copy the address , it should be the same when you paste it, unless your clipboard was manipulated. But if you have a Bitcoin link, it might show you one address, but the target of that link might be another address.

Nope. If you mined with a pool you will only get the share you mined, payed out with threshold or not. So those who sent their share directly to Gox would just be found if it was monitored for unspendable BTC (which gox seemingly did not).
@_date: 2015-05-12 12:38:22
A hash might be a small chunk but you could store bigger junks too. Also with a hash you would only create sort id a proof if existance. The data itself would not be stored. 
Anyways it bloats up the blockchain. There are other coins better suited for that, like Namecoin, Emercoind (I think also datacoin).
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:01:57
So same applies to Stellar and maybe others...

There are various things fishy here:
* how did he get access via team viewer? Usually you would need to confirm team viewer access on your side
* how did he get the blockchain.info access? You need credentials to do that
* did you just sit there and watch what was going on? Mouse control? Really?
* if that money is that important to you, why to hell did you keep it on blockchain.info that you accessed from a computer which is either malware infested or wide open or both? 
I am sorry, but some lessons tend to be very expensive.

He already presented his solution...
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:48:00
1. Install latest Bitcoin core. 
2. Dump all private keys into a list using the built-in command line tool (there's a command for dumping the whole list, at least in 0.11.2)
3. Import your private keys wherever you feel at ease, e.g. a sgpv client like multibit or bither.
4. After successful import, destroy the list and if not yet done, secure your wallet with a passphrase in Bitcoin core.
EDIT: just for others looking for the same. The command to dump all private keys of a Bitcoin core wallet is dumpwallet.
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:45:15
Instead of dumping single keys you can also dump the whole wallet by using 'dumpwallet /yourtargetfolder/yourtargetfile.txt. For this you need one of the latest clients.
Then you can import the keys in whatever client or service you feel at ease with.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:37:41

I know all you are saying and you're absolutely right. I just imagine that there are dozens, maybe hundreds of solo miners out there hoping to find a block with a 333mhs BE or similar. And I am curious if someone found a block with his shitty BE lately...
I stopped mining with 200ghs after February 2014 and sold or threw away all my miners. But sometimes I think about setting up a single 333mhs BE on solo just for the fun of it.

Nobody has to use it? Right. But we want to use it. If it doesn't work, why should we stick to it and not hop on to LTC or ETH or whatevershitcoin?
Spam? Probably yes, but it must be able to deal with that as spam won't differentiate from what happens when it's adopted for paying your coffee etc.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:42:34
Not really. What you could do with simple means: You send coin A to an address A you have the private keys to and you send coin B to address B you have the private keys to. And wait a bit until both tx got a few confirmations. 
What could happen, if someone deliberately replays tx, already the second tx b could fail because coin b's transaction was replayed and coin b now sits on address a as well. 
Wait and repeat.

The above comment is not trolling. You can't discuss Bitcoin these days without touching that subject. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:45:15
That's the problem if you send it to somebody else. That 'somebody else's could replay the tx and steal 'the other coin' because he initiated a second transaction on 'the other chain'. But it's not the case that somebody else just randomly can steal it from you. That's as unlikely as somebody could brute force your private keys. A stealer must be at the other end of a tx you started. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:25:17
Some are getting downvoted because their posts do nothing in terms of adding value to the discussion or having a news value. Eg. I just downvoted your post because of that.

@_date: 2015-08-14 06:33:22
You don't need a full node to mine. A mining client, a pool membership and a target address is enough.
Full nodes are computers running a Bitcoin client which have a full copy of the blockchain which is constantly updated and distributed to other nodes.

Yes. If you own the private key, you really own it (and all fork coins).
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:20:00
The bruteforcing is not the expensive thing, but monitoring ton of private keys might be difficult. I think they they just check all new tx against a database of public/private key pairs.

More or less. They lend you real BTC for your GOX to do margin trading or you can sell him the GOX at a rate of 0.11 BTC each.
Also BTCbuilder filled the claims for the distribution of whatever remains of MtGox, so people who hold GOX, will eventually get their share through BTCbuilder.

Everybody recommends not to use PayPal to sell Bitcoins. Especially no OTC trades with private users. PayPal transactions can be reversed. If you find a company you can trust that offers PayPal let us know. But I strongly advise against. It has been discussed 1000 times in this sub.
If you have a bank account, try to cash out on an exchange that offers Swift withdrawals, like Kraken or Lykke (idk of they offer that for Mauritius).

1. The network itself has intrinsic value as it can be used as platform for other applications
2. One of these applications is e.g. Counterparty (XCP). On Counterparty you can register/transfer tokens (among other functions) with simple BTC transactions. Those tokens can as well hold value.

You seem to miss some basic understanding how these things work. Nobody 'gives' you anything. Imagine the fork like the whole chain of transactions and all the adresses are being copied and from then on exists as the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Segwit2x Blockchain (commonly referred to as Bizcoin). As you had a private key for an address on the pre-fork-chain containing an input of 1 BTC, you now have the same private key for the same address on both post-fork-chains without doing anything. Your 1 BTC is already there. On both chains. (BTW if you had your BTC on your ledger nano before the BTC Cash fork, also BTC Cash is already there...)
As your hardware wallet stores the private key and you are able to use it, you have the possibility to spend that 1 BTC on both chains. In contrast, if you had your 1 BTC on coinbase or any other exchange that does not offer control over your private key, you only can spend it on the chain(s) coinbase will support. That's why everyone tells you to move your BTC to an address where you control the private key.
Now if you understand that, move further and investigate what a replay attack is.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:24:06
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:05:13
We call it decentralization.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:20:00
Exactly. The problem is, that after the fork, prices might fluctuate and you might try to sell 'the other coin' as fast as possible. If you now start a transaction on chain Beta, sign it with your private key (usually a wallet does that for you), and broadcast that signed transaction on chain Beta, a malicious actor could broadcast the same transaction onto chain Alpha which would create an identical transaction on chain Alpha. Now imagine you send your Betacoins to betacoin-adress X on an exchange, the malicious replay transaction would cause a transaction of your Alphacoins to an address the exchange would not check for Alphacoins, because they only check it for Betacoins. Coins end up in Limbo, where only in the most optimistic scenario a support person of the exchange can recover it.
So think about what you will do with it, not to end up being pressed to an action you might regret.

Internet access seems more or less crucial of course, but getting access to Internet seems easier than to bank accounts. To be able to trade Bitcoin you don't necessarily need access to ATMs and banks. You could be trading it against goods, from small exchange offices, cornershops or possibly recieve it from relatives from abroad. Of course you need a device to sign transactions if you want to spend. Once you have Bitcoin, you can trade directly in Bitcoin, at least that would make sense because the only fees would be network transaction fees.


Yes. The miner who finds a block selects the transactions of that latest block and includes verification data from the last block.


Genesis block (the first block): 


Empty blocks can also be mined. The difficulty adjustment guarantees that statistically every 10mins (in reality it's a bit less) a block is found. Independent of how many transactions took place.


Not necessarily a need, but there's an incentive, at least as long as there is a bounty (the block reward) that earns you more money than you waste buy buying energy to mine.
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:17:58

With brainwallet you can just create a private/public key pair, it's not a wallet you could use for payments. For doing this you need a client like multibit, bitcoin core, armory, mycelium or an online client like blockchain.info's wallet. 
You said you sent funds to an address you generated on brainwallet. I assume you got the funds from an exchange or so. In order to be able to move the funds, you have to be able to control the address in a client. So this is what you should do:
You import the old private key into multibit, armory or mycelium etc. (or blockchain.info) and swipe the balance of your old address (means send all funds to a newly generated address). Then you can use multibit or blockchain.info as your client. You should swipe the old address because brainwallets are considered not being safe enough, as they can be bruteforced, depending of the used entropy.
Then backup your keys. Depending on the amount, inform yourself about cold storage methods or methods to securely store your Bitcoins (online clients like blockchain.info are not among them).

It comes with a tiny preconfigured webserver where you can put up things for sale and that only makes sense if they tie all those tiny webservers from their "bitcoin computers" together in some kind of a decentralized marketplace. 
But you could achieve all that by selling or handling out the software for the marketplace feature. No need to sell an overpriced Raspi with an overpriced miner.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:22:15
I don't see a reason. The only potential is in the software they provide. And this is exactly what makes me furious: Why do they not just sell software or (if necessary) access to a platform, that brings all the beauty of these ideas with it?

What a bizarre question. 
As you know very well from your own experience, it's great to receive hundreds of 0.20$. But it's a completely different thing to pay 400$ for a 125ghs miner, which pays you 0.20$ a day.
The onboard marketplace server thingy might be the only more or less useful thing, but that's software and can be built very fast, by a rookie programmer.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:24:48
And you won't buy one of these devices or use 21 services without giving them at least your name and email. It's not helping anonymity.

LOL, what a BS. 


Haha! A "quick hit"! Money for free! Quick! Haaaaa!


It will mine less than 0.20$ a day. You will only be able to buy very tiny tiny things, like a chewing gum.


Every computer running a Bitcoin client can do that. Plus, it's a bad idea to hold BTC on the same device as a publicly accessible web server.

That's me point too. If their marketplace idea is as great as they want to make us believe, they shouldn't obfuscate this idea with selling cheap hardware for lots of $$$. They should simply sell/handle out Raspi images or just tr software.

You could also generate these wallets on your own computer instead of hoping that you can trust an online service. You only need the software clients of bitcoin, lotecoin and dogecoin.

I just played it through with 20$ now as I was curious about the effective fees. Here's the transaction chain: 
1. Pay ***20$*** with Paypal (Virwox fees: 0.35€ (or 0.39$) + 3.4%)
2. Balance upon receipt on Virwox: ***19.02 $*** 
3. Sell 19$ for SLL: ***4366 SLL*** (Fees: 50SLL + 2,9%)
4. Sell 4366SLL for BTC: ***0.061 BTC*** (Fees: 50SLL + 2.9%)
5. Withdraw BTC (Fee: 0,005 BTC)
6. Receive ***0.056 BTC*** on my wallet (Coinbase ***15.20$***)
Seen on bitcoin network within 1 Minute after starting the withdrawal on Virwox. Of course this was a small amount so fees are relatively higher than if you converted 200$. But still, they are extremely high.

Honestly, some more criticism regarding all these "crypto news" sites would be great. Every kid that can click a WordPress site together runs a crypto-news outlet nowadays. And even some of the older sites are not free from influence. I remember a time when coindesk was new and published several very uncritical articles about UNOCS, an announced cooperation between Feathercoin, Phoenixcoin and Worldcoin, while everyone on bitcointalk knew that it was most likely a pump and dump scheme. Some weeks later UNOCS imploded.
So yes, people should learn that they can't trust any source. Not only, but especially in the crypto world.

Nope. Because most bitcoin addresses are generated by software clients on individual computers and not by 'providers' of some sort. That's at least how it should be...
BTW. Multibit is not an "offline" wallet. Usually it's host computer is attached to the internet.

Be aware that fees are very high (1x on deposit/1x on $ to SLL/1x on SSL to BTC/1x on BTC withdrawal) and you might be better off using an exchange or localcoins or the Mycelium local marketplace. I used Virwox several times 2 years ago without being a SL player. So I have no connected SL account. Used Paypal and paysafecard to cash in. Always received my coins, sometimes it took some hours, but never more than 12 hours. Always made me a bit uneasy when waiting too long.
There is a maximum you can deposit (like 320$ with paypal/220$ with paysafecard).
If I remind it right it only works from $ to BTC not backwards (not sure but I think you can't buy SLL for BTC on it.
I also think Virwox does not seek too much publicity on it...
Edit: 
Edit: Current price (excluding fees): 
1$ = 239 SLL |
1 BTC = 66876 SLL |
1 BTC = 279$

They are not dumping the coins into an exchange, so the overall BTC price will only be affected by hopes and anticipation of other market participants, not by the real auction of 50k coins.
The auction winner will also not sell them at once, because he's interest will be to get the most out of it or to hoard it. So the influence on the public BTC price will be marginal.

You should maybe get the original bitcoin client or alternatives like armory, multibit or mycelium and generate an address there. Then send BTC to that address and take the necessary measures to protect your new wallet. Same with altcoins.
And you should transfer the funds to a new wallet, if you take em off exchanges. Having your private keys on an online service is always dangerous.
And... maybe you should read a bit more about private keys, online/offline wallets, cold storage and so on...

Depends on the amount. If you consider buying a lot, you should read further on how to securely store bitcoins. 
One way is to use a completely offline device. Then generate one or more private/public key pairs on that device. Write the pairs on paper and make sure they are correct. Then transfer the coins to the new public keys (addresses). This is one way of a cold storage.
If you then want to access the funds, import the private key into a wallet (eg on your smartphone) to spend the coins from there.
There are a lot of tools and wallet software that can help you with this. Read more to be sure how it is done...

No, there were prices on exchanges before Mtgox. You can find some via bitcointalk on the Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive:
Like 1 USD = ~1600BTC

The video is from October last year, so I guess these guys won't be that happy with the current price...

Ok. I work on that I will.

Yep, this witch hunt is retarded bullshit. Will result in some people shutting down their full nodes.

Funny how there are people who think that there could really be some traders who are capable of doubling the investments within such a timeframe and would still seek peanuts as investment money... 
Another "greed makes you blind" scam scheme.

Wow, after ALS, Ebola and ISIS. I don't know if that is good news.

You can send BTC to any address that is possible. And you can claim these BTC if you have the right private key for that public address, that's all. The blockchain is dumb, it only knows about public addresses and only after the network was processing a transaction to an address.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:44:05
You could look for BTC ATMs near you, there are maps and directories if these machines in the net. And you could check if there's a seller near you on localbitcoins.com. 
Depending on the he country there might be other places to buy bitcoins.

At least you could offer us a short story or some links we could read to see your writing skills. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:55:48
guess I'd cash out 10 or 20k$ and keep the rest in BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:34:46
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:20:44
I think that should be possible. But instead of setting THE price and using an average of different prices on exchanges to draw a graph, you could set up a timeline with a graph for every single exchange you find data from. Then add a date selector and show all the different prices of that specific timestamp. You still could then calculate the average price of that moment.
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:42:59
Well, then you found a business niche. You could implement that I-am-alive-server and the means for non skillful BTC users to created said smart contracts. But users should also teach their kids on bitcoin, so they know how to take care of their wallets.
A heart rate monitor is also not necessary. Just a server that sends emails or other messages to you to ask if you are alive. If after 3 questions no confirmation comes back, it would initiate the transfer.
You could also use 2 existing services. 1 to send your kids a cryptographic key and one to send the encrypted private key along with instructions.

Maybe you should just use your brain instead of listening to other people.

I guess that was Laszlo, the pizza guy.

@_date: 2015-02-13 16:14:34
Who knows. If someone tries to manipulate the price he will try to do that upwards and downwards... I stopped looking at charts to register every movement, causes more stress than profit.

If you loose your private key, your Bitcoin are lost. So your title must always be true. You can't loose bitcoin if you don't possess them private keys (anymore).

I think remittance is the biggest potential of BTC. The question is, what is necessary to do to get Bitcoin on top of the list of any migrant worker.
- he needs access to BTC
- relatives need access to BTC
