I'm shocked at how fast it's growing these past few months, I'm not sure when to cash in. now? or at least get my initial investment back now and play with "house" money? hah. 
heck... I thought I bought in at a **bad** time when I purchased £100 worth (well, about £90 worth after unchangeable fees, thanks to coinbase. I didn't need it in my wallet instantly, rather have saved the £5 mining fees and had it in a few days later... the other £5: I get that you gotta make money, so that's okay. just wish there was an option for lower fees...) when it was at 6k/btc, the gamble paid off though and now I'm happy.
footnote: had I not been an opiate addict, fueling my addiction through dnms, I would be a millionaire right now (or at least a hundred thousandaire). I don't dare go back through my transaction history on localbitcoins as it'd make me sad. I still remember my first BTC transaction... about 0.6btc for £40 when I was a little tween. spent it on weed and thought it was daylight robbery that it cost so much, and was a huge hassle. I thought it'd just be used as an underground currency instead of blowing up like it has, and being legitimate.

I'm laughing because I don't hold and pray to trading analysis, I buy low and sell fucking high. bitcoin WILL reach higher highs and higher lows. I bought back in at 6k, and plan to sell at 10k - 11.2k unless we can get past that nasty resistance. 
I mostly perp trade futures for fun

if it weren't for their sacrifice, we'd very likely not have seen BTC hit $10k simply because it's hard to value something without value. they took the first hit, and many of us took lighter hits in the future. 
I know the first 0.4btc I bought, I purchased for &lt;£40 and bought something for &gt;£49 with.
the "100 million dollar pizza" person is simply just somebody who got free pizza. because without their sacrifice, we wouldn't be here today.
besides... very likely, they mined a lot more BTC.
the true loser here is the person who lost their 100+ BTC in a dump because
a. it's no longer in circulation (correct me if I'm wrong)
b. well, the money, mr lebowski

oh my. I'm glad I purchased some at £4700(?) today, maybe it'll increase to £7k with this news before I wake~~~ (jk I know it won't, but a boy can hope! I did have to pay £4.40 in network fees today though on £40 from CB (£2 more on top for their dumb fees, and it was a crap rate)... so I hope I can make back what I see as lost money with this announcement)
I hope there's a solution for the really high mining fees (if you want your transaction to finish within 2 hours, that is. mine took 1 hour 48 mins with &gt; 10% "tip") soon, 'cause it's not sustainable if we want BTC to become a highly traded currency like regular money, legally. because once the tax man starts getting involved and you have to pay VAT for legitimate goods in the UK, paying with BTC over things like visa/mastercard simply doesn't look viable. merchants will take a certain hit in terms of transactions, but not &gt;10%.

o h thx for reminding me to buy more drugs (jk I'm clean 3 weeks now and will be keeping my btc in a wallet until it reaches a 10k peak. I know it'll happen one day)
