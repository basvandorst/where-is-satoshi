What was the amount, and did you add your personal information in your "My Account"? There is a sell limit on unverified users.

Please check your inbox now. Your trade has been approved. Thanks and sorry about that. Your trade was flagged as fraudulent because your personal info is still missing (Please update it when you get a chance). Ideally you wouldn't need it to trade $5, but you would need for trades of $100 or higher.
