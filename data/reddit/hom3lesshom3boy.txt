Does this work the same way when selling on Coinbase?

That's exactly the reason why I suggested it in the first place, but without divulging too much info their transactions may get some US government scrutiny. Nothing illegal, but I want at least something to base my idea on. Do you know of anyone who used bitcoins to transfer money out of China on a long term and repeated basis successfully? Or know where I can find info?

Thanks for the lead. I tried to look up some proof for your statement, and all I can find that Friedcat has ASICMiner operations in China; I couldn't find anything exactly saying he sends "millions" worth of USD in bitcoin on a weekly basis. Do you mind citing your source?

Well for me, I didn't mine any and just bought off of coinbase. So the tax basis should be what I bought them for, correct?

I haven't seen a single apology made yet. Please stop making excuses and apologize for your ineptitude. Your credibility has been ruined so you might as well start salvaging it.

Corporate is going to shut them down faster than the government does to itself

You're absolutely correct. I'll ask her to see if can list the address on her site. Thanks!

Can I ask what you did?

Sorry I didn't mean that I wanted to cheat, just the most "efficient" way - e.g. cashing out all at once, in intervals, directly depositing into a personal account vs. a trust fund. Those sorts of things.

What did you do?
