Kraken has nice options, bit Bitstamp has 100x the market depth.

Why would it cost a lot in fees? As I understand OP, he sent all the faucet outputs to a single address. Making a new payment from that address shouldn't require a lot of data, should it?

Thank you!

Excellent! Thanks!

I also withdrew my BTC from Kapiton a few weeks ago. It took a day or two, but the transaction came through.

Mining is a business very different from retail. Being good at one doesn't make you good at the other.

This looks like a very promising service. Can I use it, when I live in Europe and want to order from EU stores?

That's what I wanted to say as well. Just because she's a woman and a Walmart clerk she is not incapable of making informed decisions.

Genuine Arduino boards are made in Italy. But yeah, it would be great if more Chinese manufactures took BTC.

Nice looking. Where did you find the original?

There is no cap. If you can wait long enough, you will make a nice profit.

If the exchange rate stays low, the mining difficulty will not keep increasing. It takes an increase in mining power (new mining equipment bought and put to use) to increase the difficulty. If the mining power decreases, so will the difficulty.

No, that's just the new interface. It's been in open beta for half a year.

The exchange rate is set on the markets. Supply and demand. Demand is high, supply is low. As you might have noticed, one bitcoin is now worth a thousand dollars.

Yes. If they set their prices in BTC, they'd have to change them every day. Very cumbersome.

Fallacy. You are always risking the current market value of the coins you hold. That goes for all investment, as long as you are invested.

I meant that there is no cap on the value of a BTC (in, say USD). The mining rate is capped to 25 BTC every ten minutes, and it will decrease in a few years. There will never be more than 21 million BTC. Double check my data, I'm on my phone.

When is it not business hours anywhere on the globe, except for weekends?

Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region under China. All the freedom you havet there night go away on a whim from the Communist party.

Today's announcement means you can pay for your Adafruit orders with Bitcoins.

The exchange rate is still too volatile for pricing in BTC to be practical.
