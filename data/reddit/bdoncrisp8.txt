How would I get a QR code for my Hardwallet without the need to plug it into a computer?
Would this risk a compromise my device in any way?
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:15:57
Okay, I will do more research. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out. Time to research!

Was going to purchase for the first time a week ago but was waiting to see if we were going to reach the 8-8.5k price first.
Does 9.5k seem to be the new floor? Would now be the time? (Obv opinion based)
Is the hearing really making any big decisions?
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:48:20
That is awesome to know. Thank you!

Would something such as an ellipal Hardwallet (spelling?) Be ideal for this?
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:08:47
The ellipal is a hardware wallet that looks like a phone, but isn't able to connect to the internet or a computer. It just has a QR code to scan. So I'm thinking that something like that may work.

Hello guys,
About to be a first time buyer. Had complications last year with exchanges. Two exchanges (Coinbase and Abra) denied me being able to apply funds and wouldn't tell me why. Weird situation.
However, it's time. I've been quietly observing this thread for a while and excited to hop on board. 
Also, what is this Satoshi tipping. Is it an actual tip or is it a joke all in good fun? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:59:29
Yeah, technically you could use a BTM and keep the paper I believe, but until you deposit the coin into your wallet, it isn't technically yours. Too scary.

Hodling is never a bad idea. It's either going to be significantly higher than it is now, or it is going to die within 10 years due to no new buyers and whales taking their money elsewhere. It's a risk I'm willing to take.
It got to 20k in 2017 where a majority of the world first heard about it. 10-11k is most certainly sustainable.

Is [Bitcoin.com]( a good place to buy crypto? I reached my limit
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:22:58
If BTC is 10k and a whale has an absolute massive stack and sells it, can he sell the whole boat for 10k or will the price slowly decline as he sells? Same with buying?
I ask because say selling brought the price down to 9.3k and he was able to sell it all at 10k, couldn't whales continuously sell and buy taking profits?

Yes. You have to go to the tab where it shows all your accounts ( USD, Bitcoin), click bitcoin, verify account. It will ask you for information and and picture of the front and back of your DL. It'll take like 4-6 hours to verify, then you're good.

Funny, I browsed your profile and you previously stated you would not buy Bitcoin because "I am not a Bitcoin slave".
Yet, your entire reddit history is on Bitcoin subreddits.  
Why not... idk... spend your time on focusing on things you do believe in, learn a new skill and achieve something.
Because rule  has always been not to focus on what others are doing. Spending your time bashing on this will do nothing whether the price goes up or down for your personal success other than inflate your ego. The ego will hold you back friend. Best of luck.

I had difficulty purchasing last year. When I found my way back to Bitcoin about a month ago, it was floating between. 9.4-10.2, everyone told me to wait until 8.0-8.5. it went up to 10.8 before I bought a few days later and then up over 12.
Now I'm reading threads of new buyers coming into the market excited and people calling them stupid because they should wait for a lower price.
Seriously STFU, your opinions are not facts, just simply opinions. Treat them as such instead of discouraging new hodlers. Very well could shake their confidence and cause them to second guess and sell out. 
Your egos are literally doing nothing but hurting the mission. Yikes. 
Why people decide to spend time being hateful to people they'll never meet is nothing but a waste of energy.

Hope you guys are enjoying your gains. I purchased at $7650 and woke up the next morning to an email that said my transaction was cancelled by my bank. I called my bank and they said they received no request. I emailed and called coinbase and they said they cancelled it for "Security reasons" but fixed the issue so I shouldn't have any future problems. However, I've been blocked from exchanging so I have to wait 5-7 business days to have an account specialist fix it. 
So I'm just watching the price soar while I get effed in the B. Tried opening an account on Abra but have to wait two days to get registered and then an additional week for my funds to clear.
Life is good ��
