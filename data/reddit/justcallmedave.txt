Oh well, thanks for the reply.

From my own experience the advertisements are working. I was walking through the city one day and noticed the ad on a bus and it suddenly clicked that I was starting to see bitcoin everywhere. "I should look into this," I thought. And I've been invested ever since.

Ditto. I was discussing it not long ago with an nontechy friend of mine who asked, "So what exactly is bitcoin?" Before I could answer a dimwit eavesdropper chimed in, "Its that thing from last year that everyone thought they were going to make a million dollars off of and then everyone lost all their money." So yeah, that's what your average jackass thinks of bitcoin....for now.

I agree bitcoin works. But I don't agree the current decline in price is *just* due to psychology. More like a combination of psychology and speculative trading. [This excellent article]( describes the potential causes of the December flash crash. Now, with that crash plus the theft at Bitstamp causing a general panic in the market, combined with short sellers all closing out their positions at once...you get a drop. Not to mention the miners shutting down as the profits fall. 
So the question is...where we all see the price stabilizing?

You, sir, are both a genius and an anus. I congratulate you sir. (I believe both my comment and yours are best enjoyed when read in Peter Griffin's voice)

Bitcoin is [considered property by the IRS]( and not a financial instrument. The proposed law is addressed at "the sale and purchase of a stock, bond, or other financial instrument." So this law would not, at the moment, affect bitcoin transactions.

I believe in theory it could happen but, as one person put it on StackExchange, your computer could, in theory, overheat and melt down into a winning lottery ticket with the proper barcode...but the chances are very slim in both cases.

My stab at the first one


Essentially it's digital money as opposed to the cash in your physical wallet. In order to understand it helps to discuss: what is money? It's a way of exchange value. So when you hand a pound note to a shopkeeper they will give you, say, a chocolate bar in exchange for that piece of paper. They do this because both of you agree that the pound note has the same value as a chocolate bar. It makes like a lot easier then carrying around, say, a bucket of milk or something else the shop keeper needs which is a barter system. Instead we all agree the piece of paper or coin has a certain value in physical goods and the holder of that piece of paper can exchange it for those physical goods. Bitcoin is a digital form of money. You can use it to transfer value from place to place at an agreed upon price. Instead of paper, you're transferring information. And instead that information being stored in a physical wallet in your pocket it's stored in a digital wallet, a little folder, on your desktop. Or the information can be stored on a flash drive or an online service just like you'd store your music or pictures.

Interesting discussion [about that topic on stackexchange here]( Short answer: the chances of that happening are incredibly small.

I'm guessing its not the confirming the blockchain (notarizing) that would apply but the creation of the asset when they are rewarded. But I think what OP implied was that spending a bitcoin would be taxable under the new law.

You forgot: 'finances terrorists.'

Old thread I'm reply to I realize so a bit out of the blue: I was wondering if you were able to buy bitcoin on Trucoin with a visa gift card. Thanks

Agreed, she should have stressed more about how bitcoin doesn't actually solve the Byzantine Generals problem except insofar as it assumes that any attacker would be computationally limited to less than 51% of the hashpower.

Your logo is a little Stellar Lumensesque no? Otherwise i really like the design, good luck with the project and please tell your dog I said 'The *blue* bone is in the garage' He'll know what I mean, yeah he'll know.

So it's Visa with a bitcoin mask on. That sucks

Well which is it?!?

"Bitcoin is that thing that everyone thought they were going to get rich off of and then lost all their money on." This was the description an eavesdropping friend with 2 higher degrees interjected with when someone asked me to explain to him what bitcoin was. Unfortunately this is the general perception of bitcoin: some vague internety thing that people lost lots of money on in 2014. Bitcoin has a real marketing problem.
