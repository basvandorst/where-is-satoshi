Behind a wall, anyone have text?

This is not inflation, you're confusing it with money supply.




 
There's no indication that the purchasing power of bitcoin is decreasing, if anything its the opposite as the exchange rate per bitcoin increases along with purchasing power.

Cant stop playing with the mempool chart
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:15:30
Been ongoing for about 45 minutes now, tons of small transactions for zero fees being added to the mempool
edit: mempool up to 20 MB... don't think i've seen it that high before
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:31:24
Does anyone have a translation of this?
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:57:30
You can see there's a lot of 0 fee transactions in the image
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:19:39
Hyperledger isn't blockchain tech even.
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:24:21
Guessing that to build a relationship they took a round as a convertible note, probably at some discount to their next round.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:26:56
Except when everyone does that, fees continue to spiral upward as people compete for block space
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:40:15
This has been happening for weeks, and is very odd that it's frequently for the minimum trade size
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:17:19
Yea, these are all zero fee transactions, the stress test paid fees. Someone's trying to make it worse.
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:31:28


That's not correct, it's less than 0.1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:03:18
Looks like roughly [$2000 each](
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:38:13
If they were all connected with no propagation issues there wouldn't be a 1.2% orphan rate
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:35:50
Are there any timelines on this release?
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:53:50
Looks like its still going on, this transaction was just published which is what they were describing they would do:
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:44:08
Transactions per sec up over 5, Mempool over 13MB... looks like they're still pushing out transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:17:44
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:05:50
Guessing Tradeblock averages over a longer period of time, not really clear what they use though.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:00:00
What is this a reference to?
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:22:21
What private blockchains are you building?
@_date: 2016-03-03 03:54:18
You're confused, there's a difference between an unconfirmed transaction and a mempool. This is most likely not in their mempool, but they still provide a lookup on the transaction for reference. Most mempool tx's are cleared after 24-72 hours.

If he actually had a lawyer they'd also be telling him not to publicly post information about a pending lawsuit.
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:02:14
City Bank?
@_date: 2016-11-01 14:28:05
Is there a tldr?
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:30:55
By that definition all altcoins should be discussed here since they're competition.
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:28:32
Peer Nova, was in an article a couple days ago.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:10:27
What bitcoin tricks are used? Doesn't seem very clear.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:03:37
I think the rule of thumb is clearing the mempool after a tx is there for 72 hours, some go off 24 though.
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:13:58
This is only transactions broadcast, not transactions confirmed which is what the debate is over.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:20:47
Doesn't really say why it's using bitcoin's blockchain as opposed to another one... or how it works. Is the record actual ownership, or just another copy while the real ownership is stored somewhere else?
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:16:36
Which makes it not a cold wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:58:56
Yea, up to 10MB now 15 min after you posted
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:59:23
Yea, I read that... what are the incentives that are similar to bitcoins? Seems more like bittorrent than bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:58:30
Yes, if you don't care about confirmations you have basically infinite TPS.
@_date: 2016-02-24 04:37:00
None of that speaks to the economics of how a payment system should be managed. Few would doubt they're great devs, but there's a lot of other factors here.
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:36:10
Those graphs are already on the site linked...
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:28:39
You were paying for lunch, which is a reasonable amount to be using paypal. How often are people really happy to receive &lt; 1¢ on changetip.
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:11:26
Yea, he used to be the "CEO" a year ago ([one article]( for example). Now he's just a co-founder. Also Peter wasn't associated until a year ago.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:52:07
Why would he delete those?
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:56:32
His point was simply that there's a governance system in place. How is this question related?
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:44:46
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:43:36
When did Nic Cary step down as CEO? Doesnt look like they made any announcements.
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:54:45
Where are you watching it?
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:16:22
Using changetip to send USD isn't using bitcoin though... and doesn't seem much better than paypal
@_date: 2015-10-22 14:39:27
For those unaware, they spun off their digital currency companies into [DCG]( This includes their VC investments as well as:
* Genesis - their trading arm
* Grayscale - has their GBTC fund
