Ok :(
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:15:58
I love Coinbase, but will certainly celebrate when a competitor emerges
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:56:09
How much did you have?
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:36:23
I just want 1 :(
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:20:41
It's worth 2k more
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:59:01
Oh okay lol

Omg finally somebody that talks about Bitcoin predictions on YouTube! You are a rare bird, indeed!
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:18:26
So pumped boys, after so much work I'm now only 0.2 BTC away from my goal! Still gonna take a ton of work, but it finally feels like it's actually possible!

Once offline, what other factors are you analyzing? Love the idea. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:04:55
Just another reason to love President Trump
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:51:31
That's what I do!
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:50:44
Really appreciate that comment, thanks!

Conceal carry is VERY difficult to get in NY/CA. Depends on where he lives.

Coinbase is the worst great thing in my life
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:57:07
I'm wanting to get a little laptop or something to use for my crypto wallet (USB) and online banking. I think a dedicated device could help me avoid malware and whatnot. Does anybody have a recommended cheapie device that gets the job done??
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:45:52
He's doing a great job. Economy still might shit the bed, though. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:03:36
I scrap and fight for a portion of ONE...and this cat has 8k!? Gawd damn!
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:45:41
Everything Roger Ver says is widely accepted as expert in the community. Just don't listen to his old videos, he used to have it all wrong. Also this is very good and reliable advice.

But, but...you're here? Comment invalidates itself.

Am middle.class and can only afford a fraction of one. I feel like I'm running out of time, so I'm actually getting a third job this weekend so that paycheck can go entirely into BTC. I really would love to get up to 1.0. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:08:08
Appreciate the reply, but moron might be over the top.  Very sensational. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:14:28
You had to sell bitcoins (plural) because of taxes!? Damn boy,how much taxes you got over there!
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:05:39
No, they done now. Mine TurtleCoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:16:35
That's my plan entirely. Just wish I had more current earning power to stockpile. Doing the best I can though!
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:34:36
Crypto tho?? Could be good for us..
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:05:38
This is great!
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:55:39
In fact!
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:08:06
Lol that's just marketing garbage 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:40:03
Obviously. Jesus, is the slash S thing really mandatory now? This wasn't even a subtle joke...
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:12:05
We want million dollar bitcoins by then! 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:59:55
Ha, the certainty on this site is always something to behold. Cheers buddy. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:27:55
I'm a HODLer. Long term belief is unchanged. This bums me out though. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:02:28
We are waiting for Pew's Bitcoin video on April 6th. Then they market will have 9M new heavy investors. It's all coordinated, obviously. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:01:33
This all the way.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:49:07
Fuck you.
