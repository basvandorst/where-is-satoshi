The main reason people have problems is that they have some random PC and try to put Linux on it.
If you really want to use Linux you need to research what hardware is compatible and *buy that*. I'm not saying you can't use Linux on semi-supported hardware and I am not saying that it'll be perfect even if you buy a computer specifically with Linux in mind, **but** you *will* save yourself a lot of unnecessary hassle if you do. For example almost any ThinkPad will work great with Linux if it's a couple of years old. Newer ones could too but check the ThinkPad wiki.
The only computer in my house that is running Windows is the one that is property of my employer. Other than that I am all FreeBSD and Linux and have been for years and I haven't looked back once ��
My phone runs iOS so can't help you/parent commenters there unfortunately. I think the iPhone works great and personally I have my software freedom covered by my laptops and servers so I don't care so much about my phone as long as it works and Apple continues to show that they are serious about customer privacy.

I bought Bitcoins for $5 a couple of years back, then sold them this summer at $25 because I needed the money. Today they would have been worth about $60.
Yesterday I bought Bitcoins for $100. I can afford to lose these $100. Every month where I have $100 that I can afford to lose I will keep buying Bitcoins with them. This has the additional advantage that by spreading the buying over time I somewhat lessen the probability that I buy all my BTC at peak.
And it goes without saying that I buy these with long term hodling in mind.
Also, also, I immeditaly transfer my BTC to cold storage. Ain't no dishonest market operator gonna take MY bitcoins from me.

So then if the only person that was mining bitcoin in the world was a single person with a single computer mining on a single CPU core, would it still be exactly the same with respect to transaction speed?

How long till the Nigerian prince letters promise bitcoins in return if you just send them some of it first? Imagine how much more easy that must be for the scammers. And soon crypto currency will be sufficiently mainstream that the scammers could have a huge crowd of naive people they can fool with something as obvious as a Nigeria letter.

They have error correction but they don't *fill* the disc with *super many* copies.
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:12:43
The problem is that you can't know which CDs will last and which won't. I too have many old CDs which are just as readable as they used to but I've also got some that error, and that's not just CD-R discs even; some of my failed discs are factory written.

I've seen it too, can confirm.

Sorry that you lost your money but why did you move them from Coinbase to BTC-E? You were supposed to move them from where you bought them to your private wallet, not to another exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:07:53
CD-R means recordable. CD-RW is what rewritable discs are called. CD-R is what OP has, not rewritable. However you can *add* data to CD-R at a later point if you select the right kind of lead out when you burn it.
