Exactly, now they can buy their apparel at their  shop of choice with BTC!

Finally our time has come.  Now all the middle-aged professional business women will be flocking to us.

I'm dead serious when I say that I texted my mom this and she immediately wrote back, "wow, soon all places will start taking it!"

I definitely see the transaction on Mt.Gox (says it went through at 13:29:28 today).  I'm not looking to use the BTC in my coinbase account this second, I just want some re-assurance that it'll eventually end up there and isn't lost.

As someone that sold at $285/BTC for a colossal 50% ROI, can everyone jump off the cliff already before I jump out a window? Kudos to those that stayed in, I was certain the correction was happening when the coinbase price went from $350 down to my sell price.  (I am being sarcastic fyi, just anxious to re-invest!)

Annnnddddd here is actually a pretty quick response!
"Thank you for your email. We are sorry to inform you that we sense an issue in blockchain and looks like BTC withdrawals are appearing on block chain with a delay. We will have this checked and we will keep you updated on the status and we apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused."

Update: It has now been 9+ hours and I still don't have a transaction ID.  I have e-mailed Mt.Gox for a time frame as to when one will be provided.  I'm hopeful it will EVENTUALLY show up in my Coinbase account, I'm glad I got out of that hellhole now though.

I appreciate the time and effort you have put into writing this, but I am admittedly not a finance guy so a lot of the lingo is going over my head.  If I am average Joe Bitcoin and have made a profit, at the end of the year do I just put whatever value I made into the "capital gains" section of TurboTax?

Hmmm, there is no tid like there is on my previous transactions yet.  Should I be concerned or is Mt.Gox just being slow?

Woke up this morning, STILL NOTHING.  No transaction ID or anything!  I have no idea what to do at this point.

So I transfered my entire wallet to my mtgox wallet and bitfloor is saying the transfer went through, while mtgox is giving me a grand total of 0 btc.  What gives?  How long does a transfer like this usually take?
