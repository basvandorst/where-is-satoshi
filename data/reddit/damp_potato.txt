and how many of those got in at the peak of the run lost 50% of the investment and will never touch it again?

i know it is, a lot of people jumped in on hype and bought.  Bitcoins daily shows confirmation of a move into a bear market. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:07:52
No you're right, you invest as a trend changes. Which happened on the daily Bitcoin looked bullish and the start of another bull run .... 2 days in a row, however the volume was too low, and now its confirmed the begging of a bear market.  Not enough interest for it to fire off another bull run

this is good as it will replace tether as the stable coin

the cme futures close on the 25th... it will dive bomb until those are closed.

Yeahhh, I'd probably get a job too.... Even if things stay merry you could obtain more and if they don't you won't be royally fucked.

been trading on bitmex since feburary, made more money in thia bear barket than the bull run.  you dont need 100x to trade, you can do it with 1.001x leverage if you want (tax free gains in UK). you can also slide locked in profit positions to 100x and utilize that capitol elsewhere.

wow sounds it. pain in the arse. ill have to have a chat with him over it 
@_date: 2018-09-16 10:33:20
bitmex isnt trading btc-fiat. its a  btc to btc contract locked at the value of btc in $ at the time of the trade. e.g. a 2x leverage 60,000$ long is 30,000 worth of btc at the entry price. closing at 10%  move would return 6,000 worth of btc at the close price

ahhh fair i'll hire someone then, a bigger guy i know have cashed out consoderably more than me without tax issues due to the 'loophole'.... hmmm
@_date: 2018-09-16 10:33:39

hmm I dunno but it's pretty similar to having a 1 million $ boxing match against an imaginary friend.

LOL hope you got that job lol

3 reasons this bear market is here to stay.
1 -  Mainstream investors just got burnt at jumping into the market at ATH and wont be back any time soon. 
2 -  Banks are banning credit card purchases and it was proven that 70% of people bought crypto with credit. 
3 - Tether is burning coins instead of printing coins to prop up the price of btc.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:39:09
people only search btc to laugh at the price and the people who bought the price at 19k not on how to buy it now :D

down trend says we'll probs hit 6k again probably followed by a couple of months of building up support and confidence between there and 8k which will undoubtedly end in a gradual climb
