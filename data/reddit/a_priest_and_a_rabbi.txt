i bought when it was near 1000 like an idiot... i'm debating whether to just pull my initial investment if it ever gets there again.

yup... not exactly an early adopter.

i've been trying to find a way to move my coin out of coinbase and that's how i stumbled upon blockchain. Ive read so much conflicting information i no longer know if it is a good idea to do so: on one hand, it is accessible anywhere but on the other it is much more difficult to buy in small amounts...

China is certainly a big deal. I understand greed had a lot to do with it but it just seems... irrational to not hedge your bets a little better. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:38:16
absolutely not. if a market can lose half it's value in just a few days it kinda tells me that not a lot of people are really seeing an intrinsic value in bitcoin and are now just waiting to jump ship.

this... is problematic and the only worthy portion of the article:

How would you describe this subreddit at that time? im new here and funnily enough I think if I did use this subreddit earlier i probably would've prematurely bought in. I cant remember if it was late june or July when the price topped $100 per but I sincerely believed *that* was the bubble's peak and resolved to buy once the initial sell off happened and well... you've seen how wrong I was. The bull completely ran away from me before I could blink and the price boomed up 10 fold. I am interested in your thoughts, who do you think sold off their btc earlier this month due to the china crackdown? early adopters or people who bought in during the run? What do you think the sharp sell off says about the intrinsic value people hold of this technology? if you are comfortable I would like knowing how long you yourself have  invested in this market...if at all.

oh thank god. i was beginning to feel very alone here. Ever since the china thing and the subsequent slide in the market my spidey senses have been telling me that maybe most who invest in BTC don't yet see an intrinsic value in BTC...
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:36:05
right when i just transfered enough to fund a purchase. i really hate my luck sometimes...
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:20:21
of course... what you are saying is investing 101 but i guess you have to assume i know nothing about it. Isn't there a little voice in you that looks at the chart and is utterly aghast on the markets ability to lose half its value in just two days after china declared its banks will not invest in bitcoin? 
I'm not saying that's the only reason why people sold and it should be obvious that no market on this earth is rational in any way but the volatility of bitcoin is very palpable... If the power of bitcoin is created by the people who invest in them, it doesn't look like most see the intrinsic value of the currency. This is what the little voice i was talking about earlier keeps telling me.

just expressing frustration. don't mind me...

oh i am! I'm actually witnessing people both flip their shit and try to stay positive at the same time. I was going to play a quick game before bedtime but i think i might end up just watching this reddit for a while. It is just so fascinating. I've already witnessed two redditors breakdown in real time because they invested their life savings into BTC during the run. Many people have assured them both not to lock in their losses... yet.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:46:29
thanks for the succinct reply. it's all i needed.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:20:32
i like the cut of your jib, it almost sounds like you know what you are saying. Thank you for not blatantly representing one side of the argument (you know who i'm talking about here). Ive been following the bitcoin game since june and bought in at 30$ around Dec 10th after i read the news on china earlier this month and the market devalued sharply. It just seemed like the perfect time to cast a penny into the pond.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:43:25
obviously not... i have no clue where you got that idea from. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:42:32
i certainly plan to throw in a $1 here or there when i can. have you ever checked out blockchain.info? it is unbelievable how much is being exchanged.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:34:01
and what a selloff it already is! 70$ down in the last 30mins.
changing the world...? millionaires...? Wow... that is some Gilded Age-Gatsby stuff right there, i definitely would've been swept up in that. Thanks for your insight
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:20:50
cute. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:09:09
i don't care about downvotes, i didn't even notice the count until you brought it up.  I do care about the comments though and although i don't think its quite the same analogy you use... we won't get into that.
I'll concede to you that i guess i did just "ask for it"... I forget sometimes when i visit a new one that subreddits are indeed a part of reddit and are made up of very much the same lowest common denominator, I won't soon forget that here. Thank you.
