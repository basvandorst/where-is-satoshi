Clearly, since total hashing is still exponentially rising, the market has not reached equilibrium. It takes time for MR = MC. That doesn't change the fact that the market is trending toward equilibrium and the best way to estimate the cost is under that equilibrium model unless we have reason to believe one malevolent actor can outpace the rest of ASIC manufacturers combined.

The analysis specifically says it holds price and transaction fees constant (snapshot in time). Difficulty changes have NO effect on aggregate revenue. I really don't think you know what is being measured here.

Where do you see this mistake? The script seems fine.
What is more realistic:
KNC building 10,000 units and hooking them up to the network before the network increases hashes AT ALL or that KNC builds at an equivalent or slower pace then the rest of ASIC manufacturers COMBINED.
Edit: also, the discount rate is an assumption. It's clearly an estimate for purposes of the metric.

This is classic micro. You need to understand how AR = AC and why that is important in this situation. Predicting future revenue of individual equipment is a fool's errand.

Discount rate has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin and/or difficulty. It's the discount for the future cash flows given the cost of capital and risk.

Hmm, interesting thought. I would think that could be true assuming the attacker's time horizon for operating is much shorter than the honest miner. I'll have to think about this.
