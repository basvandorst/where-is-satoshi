I predict next futures will close at 10,900!! Do tha math!
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:09:23
I agree with this completely! No coincidences are that big!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:18:01
I believe the IRS gets notified if you SOLD or TRANSFERRED over 10k from coinbase not purchased.  My accountant told me last year I would need to report earning if I sold but not when I purchased.  Bitcoin is looked at as property.

If you can't tell the difference between two things is it reasonable to say they are the same?
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:06:05
How do u know what he needs it for lol.  Can you get cash? If so go to a bitcoin ATM and fund ur wallet immediately

I like this  I have an addictive personality so I try to get addicted to good stuff
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:32:13
Yes it's the winkelvoss twins exchange  you can buy eth or btc thru them with a bank acct and cash out as well.  Very low fees.  Way cheaper than Coinbase
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:17:57
Bitcoin has been very busy today.  Can you raise your transaction fee? Gdax doesn't charge much so I'm assuming they have low fees attached to their transfers which could hurt you in times like this.  I'd look into that to help speed it up but this is common and your coins should arrive eventually
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:31:34
I might pay attention to this in the future.  Thank you ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:25:40
U can buy bitcoin with cash at a bitcoin ATM and then send.  U need to download a bitcoin wallet on your phone.  Sounds like you're pretty new to this.  There's some great online tutorials to help u get bitcoin on YouTube 
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:04:22
Yep 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:21:43
How about give Jesus the status! He's the one who gave us crypto! 
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:16:12
I think they are but unfortunately Apples OS is not very secure.  That is why they are able to have so many apps.  Get itself a second phone if you want to hold crypto on it.  A Blackberry will be your safest bet. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:54:00
I won't downvote you for ur opinion but I do feel you are dead wrong
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:03:30
Ok why does the government still only use Blackberrys? The security!! Ever heard of blackberry enterprise!? Anyone who knows security won't touch an iPhone w a ten foot pole  
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:05:22
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:56:58
Agreed but u have to hold one way or the other until u use.  Plus it sounded to me like was trying to hold.  If using then why not use a secure desktop wallet? I can't use bitcoin in person unless peer to peer anyway only online.  It's not like u can use bitcoin in the mall yet!
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:58:22
Sign up for Gemini and never use Coinbase again!
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:23:29
And there are processors for your websites like bitpay  u don't need a developer to accept
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:39:32
It's not really going to matter hun because the value would be the same of both coins.  Now to be savvy u should buy the second coin at the lower price because u are going to get a bigger fraction of the coin since it's cheaper now.  Then let is go back up in value.  When I actually use bitcoin I like to buy it as close to when I use it as possible even when I have coin available.  This way it's as close to getting the same price I paid for it.  Hope that made sense to you
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:47:39
Ur ratio is way off
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:51:28
U are right about this! It happened to me too before and total bs.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:39:34
Paxful but the fees are ridiculous   
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:44:47
Ok yes I will dig some up later I'm sure when researching.  I do have some Amazon and want to get into Alphabet.  I'm an apple hater sorry.  I do think a smart investment for those who can.  I just can't! And yes I really like blackberry as a company.  Smart team and with blackberry enterprise being focused on business models I think they can make a come back! I don't think they will do much with their phones, they are just too old school but who knows.  More is in store for blackberry.  Sorry for pissing u off.  I was just being a jerk.  Donald Trump references rile me up!  I'm actually a grown ass woman and not a kid! Have a great day.  If I find some good articles I'll post them ��
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:36:43
Yea sorry I use an accountant  they do matter there.  You may save itself some money by using one as well so I don't overpay

Depends on if your using LIFO or FIFO  you should google those terms for way better explanation than I can provide 
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:05:39
I did check your references.  Looks like ur right about the government before you get ur panties in a bunch! Lol! Also I own blackberry stock and just always liked the phone and feel more secure with it.  Looks like I've got some research to do today.  Thanks for updating me! You were condescending but as far as I can tell from a quick look correct
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:22:50
Give them ur wallet address. That simple
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:17:22
Open up an acct with Gemini and cash out there or open a new checking acct with chase and add it to your coinbase
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:13:51
Should be under or next to the QR code  what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:14:29
I would never use anything called shitexpress.com
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:32:52
Wow! I hope you're right! Nice way to look at it
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:50:01
Wait till 5k
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:06:45
No they've gotten a lot cheaper  go to the ones that have more coins than just bitcoin.  Those r the cheapest
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:02:07
No ur wrong and ignorant and fucking Donald Trump is the best u can do.  You should be ashamed of yourself
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:40:10
Actually try localbitcoins some sellers on there may accept prepaid
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:59:29
I think for safety you can put the password in wrong 3 times and it will reset the seed.  Also if there's a scratch off to reveal ur seed that is a scam.  That's the only amazon scam I've heard about.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:57:38
Hahaha ok I did hear of this 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:55:16
U can usually raise the transaction fee directly in the same payment
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:32:13
I would have totally got those!
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:28:14
Yea cuck privacy is a whole other thing 
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:31:55
Tax day on 17th doesn't make sense to me to sell but futures expiring in the 18th does!
