yes they require ID and it takes forever. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:12:06
Coinbase, despite it's flaws, is literally the most reliable place to be able to buy Bitcoin with a credit/debit card. 
If I'm wrong, point me to another place because I haven't seen one that makes it easy. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:33:25
1) I seriously doubt you'll be affected to any degree past a small annoyance, if that and
2) It's not like money stops being accepted because the government "shut down" lol 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:50:11
Why, Bitcoin isn't something you can counterfeit - that's literally the whole point. Overstock was just stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:39:18
you guys should probably stop taking all positive news as gospel and all negative news as false. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:40:37
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:57:48
not forever, only until someone cracks the encryption.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:11:30
up 17% after plummeting from 19k lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:09:31
that's a different problem then
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:28:22
Can someone explain what this means? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:57:11
When the price fluctuates by thousands monthly, how could they not possibly care? If the dollar was with $1 today, $3.50 tongue, and $0.75 the next week, you're saying you'd use dollars to conduct business?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:53:15
Kind of funny people are clowning on Warren Buffet, one of the richest people to ever live, for saying a market like Bitcoin where the price fluctuates by thousands from day to day isn't a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:20:40
This is in Canada and you're blaming America?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:27:58
That money is only real if you cash it. I COULD have a million dollars right now if I had saved every penny I've earned in my life, but I had shit to buy.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:59:20
Dude TIL is literally used everywhere - the least surprising place for you to see it should be reddit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:05:25
Sounds like you spent a lot of time jerking off Bitcoin and they didn't wanna hear it, so now that it's crashing they're just giving it back to you lol
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:56:12
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:52:12
Don't believe you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:31:09
what is day trading
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:32:17
yes, and who cares? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:31:34
Dude if you're a developer, get started yourself lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:22:22
How are they able to afford the fees? I noticed transferring my BTC to wallet that they sent two amounts, mine, and a larger amount to a different address.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:27:57
cashing a work check and cashing in your 401k are completely different so why are pretending not to get this? 
if your job started paying you in beanie babies would you be happy
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:15:35
wait,  of spamming up the block chain is a legit worry, why would you even want people to use Bitcoin as regulator cash
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:46
if you only have 20 seats on a bus your bus sucks. i don't care how many trips it's made without an accident, you ain't doing volume. 
there's a reason the Concorde doesn't fly anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:17:23
what is this supposed to mean
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:05
Oh, you cash your 401k check twice a month to pay for mortgage, food, and other necessities? Huh. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:14:53
why would you drain your bank account completely lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:57:05
easiest place to buy bitcoin using debit/credit card with minimal fees? 
is it coinbase? with the $17 fee? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:06:00
sounds like you're living your life as a complete hassle for absolutely no reason
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:16:19
lost for good - somethin like 25% of all bitcoin in circulation now is already lost lol. I don't know wtf they're gonna do as that percentage climbs
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:44:57
Possible the dumbest idea I've ever seen.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:49:17
what happens at the fork
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:36:24
Sending a fax in the United States was never illegal. Sending junk mail fax was, but the idea that faxes were illegal to send is ridiculous lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:10
how are you supposed to get get Bitcoin without using money to buy it? 
mining is impractical. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:04:30


Why didn't you start warning people after the second time lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:25:43
How do I buy Bitcoin with USD that doesn't use Coinbase and doesn't take days or weeks to verify?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:50:19
investing is fine, paying fees is fine, but there's no need to pretend it's anywhere NEAR being able to use it like cash/debit card. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:22:40
what do you mean? any handy links? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:01:28


A whole 11 days huh? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:13:12


And wasn't simple - which is my point. Words are simple. The actual things aren't. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:31:21
if the price moves one fucking dollar you people say "it's a whale, it's a whale!"
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:52:56
i meant more like how to get started lol
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:43:25
Yeah, I called and canceled that shit so fast with my bank lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:16:25
if it's that simple why is it taking so long
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:51:23
it is completely crazy and that's why i have to laugh when people talk about using bitcoin for "everyday needs" 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:29:36


I remember when it was $7.
Not really bothered by it, considering the only reason to buy Bitcoin back then was to buy drugs - it would have been spent immediately and / or forgot about. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:29
where can we even buy to get it now? coinbase ain't working. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:20:02
it still may, but why the WHOLE account lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:44:04
if i went to the store to buy a $1 soda and the clerk told me "that'll be $1 + $18 in fees" i'd never use that store again. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:18:20
No matter what it's clear he was gonna sell them early. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:59:03
"I don't trust Coinbase, do you think I should setup a second account with them?"
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:52:49
Point me to the Walmart that accepts it. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:43:32
Why didn't you just tell them they're idiots and tell them you've made bank?
Lol why does everyone have to make things like this a big production.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:40:33
You're not getting rid of anything and you know it lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:22:17
I mean, yeah dude, you clearly did lol. Either "your brother" or you. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:03:59
Where can I buy BTC (or other altcoins) aside from Coinbase/Gdax? They're disabled my account because I halted a transfer that was going to take too long. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:17
You: "We want Bitcoin to be a form of money that can be used in daily life!"
Also You: "Nobody should be wasting BTC on anything less than a car"
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:42:18
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:00:35
sha-256 is 32 bytes, not 64. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:26:14
Im convinced this entire sub reddit is just memes and people pretending to panic and pretending to know what they're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:08:43
Lol, so Bitcoin is just gonna get bigger and bigger like that? If it's to become a world currency, how will the size grow?
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:41:51
The fact that everyone talks about "hodling" instead of using makes it pretty clear what people are in it for.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:38:12
Nothing says secure like losing 50% valuation in a month.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:01:23
I didn't say there wasn't - just saying the majority of what you see on this sub is about holding for money
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:26
instant buy? 
@_date: 2019-02-04 16:50:50
So best case scenario is 2019 there's no progress
@_date: 2019-04-26 04:13:23
that's what bitcoin was sold as for a very long time.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:24:43
paypal isn't a currency. 
mt gox shut down. remember that.
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:45:42
Gab is the racist social media site, right? 
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:52:09
obviously paypal goes down every now and then, not that your screenshot proves that. the point is paypal isn't a currency. 
if paypal isn't working, you still have your money - unless you're dumb enough to keep your money in paypal, that'd be reckless.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:56:12
That's literally how it was billed
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:06:43
How is Bitcoin anonymous again? If someone ever knows your btc address, that's game over right? You'd have to withdraw that money and put it back in, right? 
If not, shouldn't these guys have done this? Why weren't those addresses monitored and blocked?
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:43:06
is this copypasta lol
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:25:56
Dude, those aren't one time things. 
If I handed you a revolver with one bullet in it and said I'd give you one million dollars to point out at your head and pull the trigger would you do it? According to you, you'd be stupid not to.
If I take you skydiving but say 10% of the time the parachute doesn't open, would you do it for a million dollars? According to you you'd be stupid not to.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:34:32
Maybe they just don't want people selling drugs in their site which is illegal pretty much everywhere.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:51:44
This is the dumbest thing I've seen on reddit in a long time.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:14:28
That's true but it's only been around for 9 years which isn't even the normal minimum amount of time to keep money in an investment bond or something like that.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:53:35
Both more successful than your fat hero though.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:13:47
You are an idiot.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:16:00


You can't go from saying this to this:


Which is it? Is he gonna have a billion dollars to pay people back or not? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:35:19


No it isn't
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:46:18
It being a good storage of value - it fluctuates wildly. Yes, it makes money but fluctuation in price is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:15:16
Dude you just said it would make you a billion dollars at the end and now there's nothing you can do??
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:30:55
Believe it or not, but Soros isn't behind everything.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:43:40
That's great, but the way he makes it seem like he's some saint who doesn't wanna have a billion dollars and will give it all away is disgusting.
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:22:29
If you can track where every stolen Bitcoin goes, how does anyone spend them or get away with it?
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:59:06
Only obstruction
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:01:41
What do you mean, become encrypted after a while?
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:33:21
Why are you saying gold being valuable for thousands of years is meaningless? If you take that tack, everything is meaningless. Bitcoin has even less use in this scenario.
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:29:48
I thought bitcoins entire draw was that it's anonymous lol
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:36:46
Exactly how much money do you think exists
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:10:46


You seriously expect them to release every single little detail of how it happened within a day of it happening?
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:02:47
I think there's a guy *still* looking for an old HDD in a garbage dump like 4 years later.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:58:24
Are you being purposefully stupid?
