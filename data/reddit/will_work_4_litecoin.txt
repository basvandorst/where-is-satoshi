Most of this was taken from interviews from "banking on bitcoin"

The Bitcoin "B" you're using is tilted the wrong way and is the symbol of bcash.
Also, why the fuck is tether making an appearance!?

He is a gold maximalist. Big surprise he's gonna be critical against cryptocurrency.  
As for "unlimited cryptos", let the market decide what has value and what doesn't. This isn't a scenario where one alpha coin to beats all others. It's the exact opposite. New cryptocurrencies allow for niche coins to be create to fill a gap better than other coins can. That's called **innovation**. 
Gold has been a convenient store of value because it has all the properties you might want in a currency. In reality, anything that people will agree has value can be used as a currency. Bone. Rock. Shells. The thing we exchange doesn't matter as long as everyone else agrees it has value. But how easy is it to transact in gold across large distances or across borders? Gold isn't a trustless, protocol-based currency like bitcoin or litecoin is. 
I don't see gold going away as a store of value. But my house is also a store of value. His whole position is "bitcoin isn't real" and "it has value today but might not tomorrow. Again, let the market decide that, hombre
I don't see crypto being a zero-sum attack on other stores of value. Competition is good for consumers. Let them make their own decisions on their risk exposure.

It's also pretty :D

**Futures aren't an investment in bitcoin!**
please explain how taking a position in a cash-based futures market will move the price?

Litecoin Foundation!
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:54:43
This is correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:26:15
Didn't SK just come out saying they were going to regulate exchanges a la KYC?
Call me Elmer because this some FUD.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:55:47
lol wut? Check my history, fam. I think this just a clickbait title. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:34:45


Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:43:05
Because it won't. It's people using cash against someone else's cash. The only variable is the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:25
"In days like this"? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:35:27
Isn't this why we have litecoin?

I didn't realize she was in such hot demand.
She's a nice, faithful lady. But I don't think she's down for that.

I'm glad the experts showing up on this thread

Remember folks, buy the dip.

Seeing as how nobody can predict the future, no answer is right or wrong. 
I think the price is running up in anticipation of the hardfork, which is around november 15th. So, probably gonna see some action when that happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:25:28
But can your Bitcoin get made into a grill? Checkmate, magical internet money.

Do more than just invest! I got into mining to create and extra channel to generate crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:46:56
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:50:01
It's a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:38:27
damn homie, that's awful. since it's a US based company, couldn't you look into some kind of legal action?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:26:54
At least from 2013 to 2015....

Localbitcoins.com... lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:11:51
You're asking a very complex question and I don't know how much you already know. There have been a few hardforks before so maybe do some google research?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:24
It's never a bad idea to invest in something if you are ok losing the money forever. This isn't a "get rich quick" scheme. It's the future of money. 
Some people can't afford to invest much while some people can't afford to invest. Only you really know which one of those buckets you fall into.

I have a hard time paying with Bitcoin when I have litecoin in my wallet
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:38:57
Assuming you already have an enthusiast-level GPU, there is no good to enter.
If someone has to upgrade, a 480/580 is around $250 and can usually pay itself off on under a year (maybe 6 months? I'd have to run numbers).
Considering mining is an expense that can pay itself off in a year--- that's basically an investment in your long-term Cryptocurrency strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:14:17
I mean, I guess they're on the right track. But why not just accept Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:57:51
You pay a fee for ease of use, unfortunately. 
Every other exchange in the US I could recommend is unstable under load or has had serious liquidity issues in the past. 
Unfortunately, Coinbase has been one of the better ones. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:10
Negative. Still can't transfer on their network between GDAX and Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:41:42
I agree! Fuck hyperinflation.
I know it's a little ridiculous but I created this Venezuelan Bitcoin design, too! Check it out here: 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:03:45
I made a video a few weeks ago where I discuss this coin specifically and reasons not to buy. I get into Davor Coin around 1:20 mark. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:26:37
Their network is down. 
I can't send funds from Coinbase to GDAX at the moment, either. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:36:30
Not sure how this would be profitable...

This friend of yours sounds like he might not be the sort of person I would personally take advice from too seriously. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:37:50
Did they give a reason why?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:38:48
Nah, but will ship international ;)
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:21:46
This is insane. Got me thinking and inspired a Venezuelan Bitcoin that I think turned out really well. [For those interested, check it out here](
