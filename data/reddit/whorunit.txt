Join us over at r/btc my friend. You bought bitcoin for the same reasons I did. It was never an investment because that isn't what gives it value. It's money (to spend).

Lol you know bitcoin started as the reserve currency of the silk road right
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:05:35

Just out of curiosity, what is the difference between GBTC and just buying BTC ? Not a huge finance guy.

Thanks Aaron. I sincerely appreciate you responding so quickly. I've been recommending your wallet to everyone I can. Obviously will continue to do so. You're awesome. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:28:56
That was it ! (I think, scanning the chain right now). I think I transposed the last two words. I should have thought of that myself, I was just so sure I had it right. Thank you so much Aaron.

Think of bitcoin like the stock market. I have 50 shares of facebook stock. I  cant go buy groceries with my facebook stock. But I can sell it to someone else for cash (someone who believes in facebook, or in this case, bitcoin and thinks it will perform well in the future), then go buy groceries. This is a massive, over-simplification but essentially, that is how you would 'get paid'.
So if I mine 20 bitcoins, I can sell those to Joe Blow, who thinks that they are going to be more valuable in the future (more companies will accept them as payment, more people will want them, they will be easier to use by the general public ect.). Or I could hang onto them if I think they will rise in value.

Pretty much. If you believe in BTC and are holding long, this really means nothing. If anything gives you more time to add to your position at a discount (if you want to). Approval would have given institutional investors and non-crypto enthusiast (think your technologically illiterate older family members) the ability to invest in or essentially 'buy' coins without having to actually sign up at an exchange and manage a wallet. It would have increased demand for coins significantly and thus, the price would have likely increased significantly.
That being said, no big deal. The only way it would really affect you is if you were really trying to liquidate/exchange your coins for fiat or something else in the very near future.

This is what got me interested in bitcoin. I like to bet on sports and live in the US. It's so much better than any other option. Even in Vegas I was literally using my btc book so i didnt have to wait in line. Have successfully converted several of my friends as well.

If he is a skilled investor, you can be sure he wouldn't be emotional either way (even if he didn't buy BTC). Rule  Don't be emotional. That being said I understand you not wanting to prod at it. If he did buy $BTC I'm sure he would have reached out to you for more information after the price quadrupled - probably safe to say he didn't buy.

I like to wager, and live in the U.S. - After using BTC to place sports bets no chance I will ever use anything else. It's so convenient. If betting were to ever become legal in the U.S. price would quadruple on that alone. I have friends who are hesitant to use it for betting because the sites are off-shore and could get away with an exit scam if they wanted to.
I feel like many people here are too intent on hoarding BTC in hopes value will skyrocket . If you really want them to become useful / valuable, **use them**. They are meant to be used as currency .. a quick and easy method of transferring wealth.
I'm not saying go gamble either. That just happens to be my use-case. Support as many BTC-accepting vendors as possible. Seek them out. That is the best way to realize your investment.

That would be $500,000 per coin

Getting the downvotes pretty quickly here. Just wanted to throw some information out there for people that may not have heard of this particular use-case. Not trying to promote anything illegal ... just being honest and giving my account / perspective on the topic.
@_date: 2015-10-28 05:46:01
Gambling with BTC is taking off. I really do think it's sports wagering in large part.

Sorry. I though 1 satoshi = 1 bit. I'm wrong apparently. 1 satoshi =1/100 of a bit. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:56:49
I know. I support you guys believe me I think it's a real cool idea. I just wish it were more something like "Our goal is to make someone a millionaire, enter her for a chance to win the drawing !"
I think I've just dealt with too many slimy salesman in my day and I'm jaded, I just can't stand false advertising. I know you guys aren't selling anything and really just trying to do something positive though. I'm probably being overly critical, it's just a pet peeve of mine. I entered though, best of luck to you, me, and everyone else. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:29:08
That's fine ... I'm still all for your sub... I just don't get why you have to say "Enter our drawing to become a millionaire now" ... that isn't going to happen.
