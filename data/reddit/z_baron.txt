I just did this last night with a transaction that was unconfirmed on my ledger nano s for ~10 days.  I simply did the following
- generated a recieving address in my wallet &amp; copied it
- sent my entire balance to that address (myself) with high fee (330 satoshi at the time)
when the high fee confirmed, it forced the other to confirm because they shared inputs. it cost about $10 last night from the ledger segwit chain.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:24:31
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:48:11
He set the fee to confirm in 3 days. He is not concerned with a timely manner. OP, you are fine.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:11:59
thats only possible with replace by fee, which is only supported by a few wallets. If you didn't originally send from one of those wallets then the replaced by fee will not be an option
Think your only option for that would be to just wait for it to drop from the memory pool. i dont believe you can double spend and cause a transaction to go null.

Yes. Most wallets have the ability to either deduct the mining fee from your 1.0, or add the fee on top of it.


yes they are mining unfound coins. but the transaction fee is also part of the reward. the mined bitcoin is not the only reward. when all coins are mined, transaction fees will be the incentive for miners.


not at all.

You can generate as many receiving addresses as you want... but your coins don't magically get transferred to those different addresses.
They are located at the address they were sent to. Thats it. So you would just need to show the BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTION not your freakin' wallet dude. 
You asked how you could prove you didn't sell them if you can't access your wallet, so you show the transaction in public ledger blockchain that shows the coins unspent. Got it?

You cannot delete a wallet on coinbase. You cannot close the account without purging all funds out of the wallet. So your dad did one of the following:
- Sold the coins and withdrew the funds to his bank account
- Is still holding the coins in secrecy
- Left the coins in the account, where they still reside 
Any actions, such as a sale and withdrawal, would be saved in your account history.

Check out  which has been operating in the US for many many years. Its the same model. All they sell is spores, no kits. Sites like  sell kits but no spores. Notice the separation? 
The DEA prosecuted people selling **growkits + spores.** Not just growkits, or spores alone. It has to be spores combined with growing material to show intent to cultivate, otherwise there is no evidence to show intent, as both products are legal to own and purchase.

we all learn a few costly mistakes when we get into crypto. think of it as a right of passage. right now is a good time to be taking advantage of exchanges that offer free withdrawals, eg gdax and a few others. you can essentially use your exchange account as a spending/receiving wallet to avoid paying any transaction fees. and then you can send your 'savings coins' to a more secure wallet.

1. Bitcoin is decentralized, and so is our community. Nobody speaks for all of us or has a majority voice. Thanks for the cheap coins, Nova.
2. I'd bet that Donny himself has large stores of crypto but I don't really see any mounting appeal for such measures.
3. Because they can and don't want an associated credit card transaction. For example, I am a vendor here on reddit and my goods are 100% legal, but can fall in sort of a grey area depending on the context. Because of that, many of my customers opt for crypto, because they don't want that transaction in their bank account history. My products range from $15-$50, and I've had at least half a dozen people buy in the last month with bitcoin, even paying high fees. On the flip-side, I have had a sudden increase in altcoin purchases, mostly ETH and LTC.

Your private keys are hold in a chip, they never leave it. Whenever a payment needs to be made, the transaction is signed inside the secure element and the private keys are not even visible by the computer the Ledger Wallet is connected to.
If you create a receiving address, it originates from the hardware. The addresses are not generated locally on your computer. 
I know it doesn't really answer your question... but rather poses another one: can a hacker alter how receiving addresses are created within the Ledger Wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:21

Absolutely. Remove your exchange bookmarks and pick up a book or video game. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:35
- Triple check your web URL in the exchange before sending
- Generate new receiving address in your wallet
- Copy/Paste address into exchange withdrawal form
- Triple check that the address pasted into the withdrawal form matches the one in your wallet &amp; send.
There is no such thing as a soft wallet. A hardware wallet is a wallet that requires a physical authenticator. I have a Ledger Nano S. You connect to your computer with a usb, then when you try to open your wallet or send coins, it requires input on the authenticator. 
Cold wallets are storage methods that are not connected to the internet. Such as key codes printed on a piece of paper and stored in a safe. Hot wallets are wallets that store your keys online. 
The abbreviation is BTC.

You won't to get your coins on coinbase for several days as it processes the ACH transaction. Yes you will be able to move them and sell them wherever you like.
I would suggest you get on GDAX. Since you are already on Coinbase, you just need to activate your account on GDAX, since it is Coinbase's exchange. You can transfer all your coins from Coinbase to GDAX instantly for free. Def beats waiting hours and paying fees just to send it to Gemini instead.

The convenience fees don't scale like you think they would. they are more like plateaus or fee levels. 0-50 is $.99, 51-204 is $1.99, but only after 205+ does it start to adjust for every dollar value. weird system. They probably make more money this way from people not realizing it.

I constantly, almost incessantly see that argument parroted here so much. I have been sending .1s and .05s with 10 satoshi fees all week with confirmations on the next block. I can only assume the people that still think this is an issue are people that aren't actually using or moving coins.

sent .1 to my ledger last night for $0.50 and was confirmed on the next block.

So the people that paid for upgrades are to blame for not building the upgrades? Not the company that failed to deliver after being paid?

miners get fees + mined coins. in ~120 years when all coins are mined, they will just get fees. at that point, the fees would more than likely be enough incentive to mine.

not gonna take this article seriously if the writer doesn't understand the basic principles of bitcoin as a payment platform. they aren't just shiny bits on your computer.

I sent my coinbase funds to GDAX and withdrew to my bitcoin core wallet and just got them. There was like a 30 minute delay until the pending transaction hit my wallet.

I'm a new vendor and I accept Bitcoin I was wondering if it's okay to announce that or is there an appropriate place to do so?

i dont know where you got 3 days. i said it took weeks for them to respond my to request for tier 3 verification. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:04:30
I requested tier 3 verification a few weeks ago. They just responded to me a few days ago and I haven't even opened the email yet. I think it's going to stay unopened.

dont ever buy amanita mushrooms. they are a deliriant, not a psychedelic. you want psilocybin containing mushrooms like cubensis.

From the comments in the thread, it seems like a good bit of people have jumped on board. In the past, the only way to increase your storage space for image uploads was to buy a supporter account for like $5 a month.
