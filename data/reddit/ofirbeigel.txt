So I'm the owner of 99Bitcoins and I really don't know what you're talking about. 
If you got an email to the address you've registered with then it's probably from 99Bitcoins. We never give out our clients' details, and if I'm wrong about this and you did get an email from someone that's not 99Bitcoins then I'd appreciate you posting some sort of evidence so I can take care of this as well.
One last thing, don't you think it would have been easier just to email me and get your questions  answered?

It's not a compilation - if you read the article you'd see it analyses why you should stay away from these site.

Haha thanks...will change..

Well that's basically the idea - we send it out from the manufacturer.

I issued an update. Hopefully this should take care of things. Please let me know if this helped.

From my calculations the fees add up to about 6.7%. So you need to see if this actually fits your needs.

Thank you very much :)

There you go....Now they're back to $55 :)

Just wrote a post about how you can buy Bitcoins with PayPal on my Facebook notes. Here's the link:
The idea is that you buy SLL (Second Life Lindens) with PayPal and than you can exchange them for BTC. The whole process takes about 30 minutes and there are some fees but I think they don't exceed 6%-7% in total. Another option is ofcourse eBay buy people request crazy prices over there.

Thanks for the info guys. I'm checking this out. What WP version are you using and what's the exact error that you are getting when activating it ?
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:32:27
You can also buy them on [VirWox]( Open an account, deposit USD, buy SLL (Second Life Lindens) and exchange those SLL to Bitcoins.

The banks have started giving us a hard time with the wire transfer. The only thing illegal is them telling us what to do with out money :) 
Hopefully they will understand soon enough that everything here is leggit and let us continue transferring our funds.

Thanks for the feedback. You're absolutely right about that :)
But still I think it may be worth it with the volatility of the price.

[ is probably best

I tried it with $50 and managed to get my BTC within 4 hours of starting the process. So it is done manually but usually takes less than 48 hours
@_date: 2013-09-25 06:25:43
Did it stay that way ? It takes about 3 seconds to load the data...

I couldn't agree more. The problem is that I'm from Israel and we are having a hard time here to create wire transfers to these websites so we have to find different ways.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:58:37
Yes, but it beats trying to buy BTC on eBay. There is another option of OTC websites that can give you better rates but there are a lot of scammers there.
