Yeah you can't be too careful... &gt;$100m is a lot of money, there's always a chance that this is somewhat shady and the whale doesn't like being watched.

I, too, can read the OP title. $1bn is on the move, most recent transfer was $100m. Even if the transfer is between 2 parties and 1 party is getting "only" $100m, that's a lot of money.

A whale doesn't have to be rational to pose a threat, $1bn worth of Bitcoins and an irrational anger at anyone following his transactions is plenty dangerous to justify the trivial effort of starting a clean reddit account.

In that case, that's a pretty great idea, there's so much innovation in the blockchain space.

They wouldn't want to ban fiat gateways because it would undermine buying pressure from the public. Once Goldman Sachs has a bitcoin ETF, they want that ETF to return as much as possible, so they want as many people to buy bitcoin as possible, so they want options like Coinbase to be widely available.

Sure, but the only thing stopping you from getting scammed by the other 5/10 is the fact that you're not a noob and you DYOR. The guy in the OP didn't do any research and threw his own money away.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:03:23
The banks are made of people, so they have as much right to buy Bitcoin as anyone. "We" don't have a say in what people do with Bitcoin, that's the whole point. If the banks want to get involved it doesn't matter, they can't control Bitcoin anyway.

I mean it's not like someone's buying silver at gold prices, more like buying silver at silver prices, which he could sell for gold if he wanted. OP guy didn't lose any money, he can just exchange from BCH to BTC if he wants. There are worse "scams" out there that will cause you to actually lose money.

What happened to DYOR? People with "no crypto knowledge" shouldn't be investing in crypto, at least not yet - it's not mature/user friendly enough to be idiot-proof. If it wasn't BTC/BCH confusion it would be something else.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:20:11
Even if there were a "hard ban" on Bitcoin (e.g. illegal to own or transact it at all), it wouldn't really work. There's a hard ban on torrenting copyrighted material but people do it all the time because P2P tech is very hard to trace and block in practice.
ETFs and "institutional money" make it less likely that Bitcoin would be hit with any kind of hard ban anyway. Take big pharma for example: if they wanted to start selling weed/THC meds, you'd have it totally decriminalised in a month, but since they don't want to do that (weed is too effective and cheap and they'd lose out on sales of other meds), so they keep it banned to avoid the competition. If big money weren't getting set up with Bitcoin ETFs then they would be directly competing with crypto. Then we'd see **way** more legislation coming in trying to make it harder for people to invest.
Once ETFs are set up and big money can get rich off Bitcoin as well, they won't stand in the way of anyone who wants to provide buying pressure, even Joe Schmoe putting in $50 through Coinbase.

Looks like it might fit a curve better than a straight line. Of course, that means less-than-exponential growth (on this y-axis, a gradual flattening off toward 100k rather than progress to 1 million).

Yup, this is fundamentally a charity event, it benefits the less fortunate, there's nothing "scammy" about it just because they chose to use a different coin. I mean, BTC is a store of value, rather than a currency, you wouldn't do a clothes drive where you exchanged old clothes for bits of gold bars, so why use BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-18 22:13:53
If someone's method to buy gold is just to Google "gold" then buy whatever's being sold by the top result, that person is a dumbass who's going to get scammed.

Not sure why you're being downvoted for a reasonable newcomer question. Yeah, miners make money from the block rewards but they also make money from transaction fees. The transaction fees are a necessary way to deal with the large number of wannabe transactions that are too numerous to fit into the each block, so each block is filled with those transactions offering the highest fees, so if you want your transaction to go through, you have to compete with everyone else's transaction by outbidding them. Without transaction fees there would be no way to choose transactions from the pool. If there weren't so many transactions (or more room in each block), there would be less competition for inclusion and lower fees.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:56:56
Bitcoin stays in your wallet until the transaction is confirmed. More specifically, the balance of an address can only be changed by confirmed transactions, so without a transaction, if you look up your address in a block explorer, the balance will stay the same.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:23:48
Yeah that's what the "mempool" is, a set of all transactions that are unconfirmed, i.e. haven't been added to the blockchain yet. If you set a fee that's too low (e.g. for BTC 1 sat/byte would be way too low) it would sit there forever and never confirm.

Crypto security 101: Don't Trust, Verify.
The only way you can **verify** a piece of software has nothing nasty inside it is by checking the source code is clean, compiling it, then comparing e.g. the SHA-256 hash of the compiled source with that of the released software, to **verify** that they are exactly the same. You don't allow us to do that, ergo your software is unacceptable.

And the price follows supply which follows the hashrate.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:32:47
Makes sense given the hashrate (and therefore cost of mining) is around 10% as well.
