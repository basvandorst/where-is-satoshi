You must be new to the news

Don't worry, we have this little corner in which we're now allowed to talk about the most pressing issue of bitcoin today, lovingly provided for us by our overseers.
It's for a good cause though: So that we don't lose the freedom bitcoin provides.

Of course not, but given that 99% of people don't understand that Bitcoin isn't owned by anyone, it's a terrible headline. People understand that "tech" and "oil" aren't owned by one person.

And until bitcoin is much more stable as a value store, it will likely remain that way.
The dollar has a lot of flaws, but damn if it isn't reliable

Holy shit

It's so sad that bitcoin.org didn't spend the $10 to buy bitcoin.com too.
It doesn't matter that it's "for profit" - a serious number of people are just going to go to bitcoin.com to figure out what it's all about.

First, value fluctuations do matter. A lot. If I make $1m and I can only withdraw $800k, that's a bfd.
In terms of usage, using it is great. As long as you're not storing it in Mt Gox. And nothing else goes wrong.
Bitcoin is very young and in flux. It's more risky as a value store at present than the dollar. I believe it will become more reliable than the dollar, but it's simply not yet.
Edit: just realized you were talking about the dollar. Sigh

What about that Japanese guy Newsweek found? Maybe he'd make a comeback if they would provide lunch.
