Thanks for the response.
sqlchain sounds good, but it's not what I'm after. Using up 100gb of extra space just to have my own personal blockchain explorer is probably overkill. It would be great for a public facing website, but not so great for my own use when I'll be doing around 10 queries a week on it, and therefore querying the node directly.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:40:21
No it doesn't.
They do this **all the time** with domains they have no interest in actually using which have no bearing whatsoever in their plans.
There is probably just a guy working on this in some tiny department somewhere who is responsible for registering domains so they have them before some asshole registers them and legal had to get involved. It's cheaper this way.
**If** they eventually get involved with bitcoin at some point in the future, the registration of these domains will have nothing to do with that decision. Hell, they probably won't even use them.
Take a step back and deal with reality every now and then. I know it's difficult not to get caught up in the insane hype and circlejerk of this subreddit sometimes, but it's much healthier to have a more balanced view.

True. But OP is preaching to the converted here :)
By "affect" I guess I wasn't being clear. My intended meaning, a bit clearer; "I don't think anyone is going to research Bitcoin or behave differently in a way we consider to be 'positive' to Bitcoin by these network SSIDs being what they are".
But maybe OP lives near a train station where bored commuters will actually see that and go "oh fuck it, go on then, let's Google this thing".
Make those SSIDs open network and serve a bitcoin website/video to them. Run that software on a Raspberry pi with a battery and go to crowded areas with bored people in. With that you might be on to something.
OP has good intentions. Just think the energy is misguided.

It is possible that a qr code can be mis-scanned and produce change in digits or add/remove didgets however the bitcoin addresses have a very robust checksum in which is so vastly remote to get a valid code it's for all intense purposes impossible.
I believe the QR code itself also has various checksums. If a code scans at all, it should be valid.

Actually I'm willing to give benefit of the doubt here.
If we assume that miners act selfishly, and only ever want maximum profit, then Jihan producing empty blocks just doesn't make sense unless:
* He's been lucky to find a block very soon and wants to propagate it as quickly as possible (12.5btc and no fees is better than 0btc) without the delay of having to fill it with transactions.
* There is a bug, as he is claiming. He is swapping between two sha256 coins to maximise his profit. As far as I know most miners have not done this in the past, it's perfectly possible that the odd bug creeps in if they've had to fairly quickly create software that can do the switch based on profitability.
Mining empty blocks just gives fees to competitors.
Maybe I'm being too simplistic or trusting. But there is plenty to be angry at Jihan about, such as blocking progress for the past year, but I don't think a bug in the software is really "ammo" for the anger.

I'm unsure how that's a concern. Anyone can open up a channel/hub and just run it on their machines. That's what I'm planning to do. No different to running a node currently in my view, at least this way I'll get paid (a very small amount) for doing it which is a nice incentive.


A good point. Presumably you could just retransmit the transaction as often as needed.
Also, if I have a transaction that was signed 30 days ago, with the fees relevant to 30 days ago, but now the fees are far too low, what happens then? Is my money in permanent limbo? That would suck.
I have a feeling smart people have already thought of this. But I can't find information on how these issues are mitigated.
And yes, try out Eclair with the [starblocks]( site, it's a neat demo. Remember to swipe left to get your receiving address to put some testnet coins into (took me way too long to figure that out) and swipe right to actually do a transaction and open a channel.

Sadly not. The 2x part increases the blocksize in a way that isn't compatible with the current consensus rules.

Story time:
I was buying some petroleum-derived diesel on Saturday. The station had signs all over it saying "Cash only". Fortunately I had cash given to me by my passenger to pay anyway, so it didn't matter in that instance.
When I went to pay, someone was in front of me discussing it. Apparently it costs 12 pence every time they do a debit or credit card transaction. This added up to over £800/month. And I guess they decided that the loss of custom from the cash only policy was worth it.
I was going to mention Bitcoin, but as I had a long journey ahead of me and a passenger waiting I didn't.
Okay. Crap story. But a true one.

Sound monetary policy. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins and we know when they are discovered and nobody controls it due to it's decentralized nature. The government can't just go ahead and say "hey, let's have 42 million bitcoins so we can fund a wall to keep out the refugees of that country we just bombed!" like they currently do with fiat.

Here's the thing... "The Market" isn't supporting 2x. There was a meeting in New York, and suddenly "hey, this thing is happening! yay!". Ermmm, excuse me? Who the fuck are you guys telling me what's happening with this decentralised currency? You are not in charge. Nobody put you in charge. Even if someone put you in charge, you cannot be in charge, Bitcoin doesn't work like that.


Interesting question.
**IF** "The Market", and I mean the **real** market, actually said "you know what, let's do this 2x thing" then sure. I guess I'd go with it, even if I didn't agree to it personally. But that's not what's happening. A handful of people will lots of money are trying to control my money and the infrastructure that controls my money. This is against the very essence of Bitcoin, and is a big part of the reason I'm off-ramping from fiat currency in the first place. If we allow this to happen once, then decentralisation is nothing more than an illusion, and we have failed. Bitcoin will have failed and we may as well just go back to fiat as Bitcoin would be no better.

Against a hard fork in November 2017. It's rushed, the nodes don't accept it, and nobody even asked the users. A bunch of suites in a secret meeting decided 'this is what Bitcoin is going to do' and I don't think the community reacts well to such 'deals'. The miners need to be reminded who they work for.
Do it properly, with the actual majority on board, and do it in November 2018 if we need the 2x part by then (I'm guessing we won't even need it, but if we do, maybe we do) and use proper signaling that all the nodes understand. And fix some bugs at the same time. Make it worth our while.
If we're going to hardfork at all, at least make it worth our while, and not just to satisfy some egos and save face for blocking progress for all this time.
I'm genuinely a little nervous about Segwit2X. Although Bitcoin has proven my fears to be misplaced in the past. Odds are it will prove me wrong again.

Neither, in my humble opinion, do a bunch of suites in a meeting. That's not reaching consensus. That's a power grab. It's the entire reason Bitcoin is difficult to 'upgrade' or 'change'; to keep it decentralised.
But somehow a bunch of rich people in a closed door meeting can suddenly decide what course Bitcoin is now taking and apparently everyone is supposed to just fall into line or something? This is against the very essence of Bitcoin.


The overwhelming majority of nodes are running core. So we'll have blocks being mined that are incompatible with the nodes. Unless that situation changes in November this is going to be a very messy situation indeed.

In the same way I wouldn't have expected Fox news viewers to vote for Hillary Clinton. If they did a poll of their viewers I would expect that Donald would have had a 'yuge' lead all the way through.
Ergo you cannot trust that source of information to be unbiased. In the same way you can't trust one of Luke's silly little twitter polls to be unbiased for the same reason. Even his recent poll which needed verified Coinbase accounts to vote in will suffer from the same problem.

Don't bother mining Bitcoin unless you literally have access to millions of dollars to buy equipment. Too many people are competing and you won't make a profit once you've paid for the electricity.
If you have a decent GPU in your computer you can check whattomine.com for other coins you can mine. But don't expect to become wealthy with this.
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:25:01
Depends. 
If I fill up the blocks with really low transaction fees that will never confirm it might not cost me anything. If the network gets close to actually confirming my transactions I can do a quick double spend to move all the money to one place with a reasonable fee so that I don't get "called" on the spam transactions and we're done.
I'm using extreme examples here, obviously. The point is the demand for free or very cheap blockspace is infinite. Segwit helps, sure, 4mb blocks would help, sure. Neither are a 'solution'. In a couple of years we'll be back here. Hell, lightening network isn't a solution but it kicks the can down the road, potentially for the next decade (although probably less). 
Keeping a proper decentralised blockchain is hard. Until bitcoin came along nobody had tried this before. There will be more bumps in the road, but it will be one hell of a ride!

It was basic/dumbed down/whatever, sure.
It's not a misunderstanding as I see it. Government needs money, government fires up the printing press. And yes, I know it's "much more complicated than that" but that's the essence of what I'm saying. And that is not incorrect.
It's called inflation, however it's just an increase of the money supply, so the money I have in my pocket is worth less and less each year as it's less scarce. I personally view that as theft.
It's worth noting I have a qualification in Economics. So I do indeed have at least some idea of what I'm talking about. Probably.

I like the idea of atomic swaps alongside this technology.
My vision:
Our Litecoin brethren can just buy shit from a store that only accepts Bitcoin (or vice versa, although I acknowledge that's unlikely) and the super clever wallet will just convert the Litecoin to Bitcoin, and send the Bitcoin straight to the vendor. Job done.
Or better still. Own Bitcoin/Vertcoin/Litecoin/Whatevercoin. The vendor accepts one or two of those currencies, or maybe all of them The wallet software gives you a choice of which coin you want to pay with, and maybe even gives you a fiat equivalent for each option. You pick the cheapest, atomic swap done, vendor paid, you get coffee/cinema ticket/whatever.
~~I have no idea if this is being worked on, or if I'm misunderstanding the technology and this isn't possible.~~ [It's possible]( It's going to be brilliant:


Alright, buy some Whatevercoin then if it makes you feel better.


Okay, pay in the coin of your choice, it doesn't matter.

That does t answered my question. And I'm not at all interested in arguing semantics. I just used 'core chain' as a way of defining what I'm trying to say for the purposes of asking the question. You're knew what I meant. You can 'translate' it yourself. 
So. Why are we sure the value will stick to the core chain and won't transferred to the 2x chain? It worked out well for the 'cash' chain, but I'm fearful it won't be such a success come November.

Blocks contain transactions.
If the block is empty, without any transactions, it means, at best, you'll have to wait for the next block to get your transaction to confirm.
But the miners still get the 12.5BTC reward for mining the block, even if it's empty. So they are being paid to harm the network, essentially.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:11:52
You have other answers but I'll throw in my 2c for question 2:


The problem for me is a bunch of suits sat down and said "this is what we're going to do and this is the direction Bitcoin is taking".
At it's very foundation, this is anti bitcoin. Nobody spoke to the users, nobody spoke to the developers who have been making the reference client since forever. A bunch of people with lots of money made a decision and somehow I'm supposed to go along with that? The entire point of bitcoin is that it's decentralised. You can't tell Bitcoin what it's going to do and the direction it will take.
If Segwit2X somehow becomes 'Bitcoin' than I'll consider the Bitcoin experiment to be a  failure and will move every penny I have in Bitcoin out to another coin or maybe precious metals or something as it proves that some suites can just ride in on their high horses and take over the network. If they can do it, so can governments (assuming there is no government coercion as it is). This is not acceptable to me.
At least with Segwit it's a soft fork. If I don't like it, I continue to use my existing wallet and simply do not participate. It's opt in. Even if I don't use it I'll probably benefit from lower fees from other people who are using it. It's a win-win, frankly. The only way I lose is if some critical bug is found and the price of Bitcoin comes crashing down, which is very unlikely at this stage.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:49:30
There are already coins that allow that. Vertcoin is a good example.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:17:17


Which Vertcoin already does, and isn't worth much compared to Bitcoin.
Like it or not, the amount of energy that goes into mining blocks does help to give Bitcoin it's value. It's not the whole story, but it's a part of it.

Short term profits.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:43:33
Sort of.
If they are lucky and are able to mine a block quickly, they'll go ahead and transmit an empty block to get the block reward. It takes a couple of minutes to get the transactions in there. So the miners have a choice:
* Mine an empty block, get 12.5btc reward
* Try to assemble a proper block with all the transactions in it, take a little longer, maybe get beaten by someone else who is propagating the block a little faster than you. Get 0BTC reward.
If they don't get lucky, and take a few minutes to mine the block, than they can use the time they take mining it to also assemble all the transactions within the block. They could still release an empty block if they chose, as empty blocks will propagate faster.
So sometimes you'll see a block go through at, say 10:00, then another one at 10:01 or something, but the second one is empty. That's usually the cause from my understanding of it. The miner got lucky and didn't want to push his luck.

I knew atomic swaps were in the works. As I'm still unsure (clueless, actually) how that magic works I didn't know if it was a bit like ShapeShift (swap me to X address) or if I had to receive the coins first and then send them to the vendor. I guess smart people will work out the details over time and I won't need to know or care as the software will do it for me.
Once this gets into a user friendly wallet, I can just load in my favourite currencies, and pay wherever I want, and the vendor can get his/her favourite currency, even if I don't normally hold it. I tap a couple of times on my phone's screen to confirm the details, the phone and the network does the heavy lifting. 5 seconds, 2 cent fee, done job. I have coffee.
I can just buy coins *and spend* coins just because I like them and for no other reason. Currently I have to hold and convert them myself which is an expensive time consuming endeavour.
This is so fucking exciting.

Thanks for responding.
One thing I do enjoy about reddit is seeing chatter from core developers. Even if I don't fully agree from time to time.


Possible with the BCH issue, although I transacted twice on it and had no issues whatsoever except waiting a long time for the blocks to be mined. If I can do this, a mere 'user' and not a 'developer', then why is Luke having issues? I guess that doesn't really matter in the scheme of things.
But I strongly disagree with the UASF issue. He is on record repeatedly saying the economic majority supported it when there was zero **credible**  evidence (as in **not** one-sided twitter polls) that this was the case.


His KYC poll is useless.
The sample size of just under 300 users. I'll be generous and call it 300. Do we have any estimates of how many people actually use bitcoin every day/week/month? Given you had to have a Coinbase account in order to participate (which I do believe was a good idea to stop duplicate voting), and [Coinbase has over 6 million users]( let's not a great sample size, is it? Around 0.005% according to my 'back of a cigarette packet' maths. Even if we half the Coinbase user count to assume they are inactive, the sample size is still abysmal. This isn't a cosmetics commercial, where "95% of customer agree this improves their lifestyle (sample size of 80)" to sell the latest snake oil to idiots, this is Bitcoin, and probably needs a *little* more respect given to polls if that's how we are choosing to obtain information.
Why should this survey be taken seriously as it contains less than 0.01% of Coinbase's customers? How is it possible to take it seriously with such a tiny sample size? Luke did a great job at coding the survey on a technical level, as I would expect. But again it falls short as it tries to tell a story without having any authority to tell the story.
You don't need me to tell you this, you don't need me to tell Luke this. I dare say you are both far more intelligent than me, yet apparently this inconvenient fact is overlooked.

Example 1: No, that's wrong. As long as LN can find a 'route' through various people to your vendor, you can use just pay them through whatever channel you have open. Much like you don't need to have a fresh ISP account for each website you visit. You just have one, pay them, and everything "just works" most of the time.
Example 2: Wrong for the same reason as 1. Unless I'm missing something you've basically asked the same question twice.

It doesn't help his credibility when he outright lied about the economic majority supporting the UASF (every single time he was asked for evidence by anyone he simply didn't respond from what I saw) or when he transmitted a BCH transaction with such a low fee the entire network ignored it and didn't even relay it (which he must have known would happen) proclaiming "look, it's broken!" and that's not to mention his twitter polls which apparently 'prove' things... 
Luke is a very talented coder, no doubt. But when he does actions that hurt his credibility it's difficult to take him seriously when he actually has a very valid argument, as skeptical folks like myself have no idea if he's being honest, trolling, or outright lying.

I like the features of Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin, Vertcoin. So I own a little.
If they make "profit", sure, whatever. I just like them, so I buy them from time to time. It's no more complex than that for me.

In reality only time can do that. Plenty of people said the similar about Bitcoin.
I'm personally not sold on it being a silver bullet to solve scalability for all time, but it could quite possibly 'solve' scalability for the next 5-10 years until we need something else.

Mycelium's fee calculation is *terrible*
Use a client that let's you set the fee yourself. 
Today mycelium was giving me a 400 satoshi/byte fee on the lowest setting. Using my ledger I was able to move money around for 60 and even that was apparently too high as it got it's first confirmation in the next block.
The only thing that is busted is your client. I'll be abandoning mycelium fairly soon.

I fucking cared. I care even more now I've found out that the Royal Family, whom I'm forced to pay taxes for to keep them in a very comfortable standard of living, have also used these schemes hide their wealth offshore to prevent them paying taxes on it.
I don't give two flying donkey fucks if this is 'legal' or not. It's fucking immoral that this is happening. It's wrong that I am **forced** to pay taxes for those leaching bastards and yet they have a tidy way of not even paying back into the system which is very generous to them on my dime. Plane, simple, fucking, **wrong**. 
And what may be less known to some international or younger readers... The Queen Mother, when she was alive, was *millions* of pounds in debt. Living way beyond her means got her into this situation. Did she have to downgrade to a flat? Let out a room for extra money? Lay off staff? Were the bailiffs called? Nope, of course not. Bank of England just wrote off the fucking lot. One rule for us plebs, another rule for them.
These fucking leaches are born with wealth I can't even imagine, and are given more and more wealth, stolen from my pay every month before I even see the money. And of course they are apparently above any moral duties or even some laws that I'm subject to. It's fucking disgusting.
I'm not at all surprised. But I'm fucking angry. Some of us care. Some of us really care about this. But we're not enough, and nothing will change :(

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:22:30
What's the rush?
I'd much prefer it if we get it right first time.
Remember bitcoin unlimited nodes had two remote crashing vulnerabilities in about as many months? Now we have the EDA which causes BCH blocks to found every 5 hours or 20 seconds depending on if the EDA has just kicked in or not.
This is what happens when you rush things. Bitcoin is still new and experimental, despite its age. If you rush things, really bad shit can happen, especially when people's wealth is involved. 
The fees have been higher than this in bitcoin terms, it's just now that bitcoin is worth so much more that we're feeling it more as we're sending less bitcoin and paying more for it in fiat terms. And obviously bitcoin doesn't care about fiat terms, it has no concept of it. If bitcoin was $10 a coin and you were moving $1000 and having to pay a 500 satoshi/byte see, you wouldn't even notice it.
I'd love zero fees, instant confirmations for everyone. But the downsides of such systems will massively outweigh the benefits in my view.
Hell, I literally can't even run a ethereum node like I used to; the blockchain is massive. I don't have the spare hard drive space or bandwidth for it now :(

@_date: 2017-11-14 17:39:27
It's not 'just' 100 mb. It's a constant stream of transactions and bitcoin is popular enough that if you move up to 2mb blocks they will still remain full. Average fees will go down, but the blocks will remain full.
1mb block every ten minutes
2mb block every ten minutes
They will always be full, or very near full for the foreseeable future. Even if we jumped to 4 or 8mb blocks, these probably won't be full but would probably fill up in a short amount of time and then we're right back to square one.
Please stop pretending to be innocent here. You already know everything I just typed and ignoring facts you don't like doesn't stop them from existing.

How much did it cost to buy this account?
I ask because this 8 year old account had very spotty comment history, sparsely posting at all and not posting anything bitcoin related at all until roughly 3 weeks ago. 
Now all of a sudden the posting history is basically 100% bitcoin and the volume of posts has dramatically increased (more in the past 3 hours than the past year, in fact). Plus it's not like you organically 'discovered' Bitcoin and asked questions like 'what is a block' or anything. You suddenly became an 'expert' 3 weeks ago and apparently found an extraordinary amount of free time to start posting on reddit and spreading your 'anti core' rhetoric.
So it's fairly obvious this account has been paid for and bought from its original owner. So I'm curious as to how much it cost to buy. I'm also curious who is now paying you to post this stuff...

Bitcoin is working, it's just more expensive than you'd like. Just because something is expensive doesn't mean that it's not working. 
People forget that bitcoin is an experiment and an entirely new way of doing this whole money thing that humans seem to like so much. We've never tried this before. 
But naturally they want it to be instantaneous, free, and give them a complimentary reach around every time they use it whilst bitcoin should happily record their data on the blockchain for all time. The entitlement is astounding.
You're expecting all the freedoms of bitcoin with the costs of fiat. Bitcoin simply doesn't offer that yet.

The software was written and 'in production' **before** the cancellation.
So either they knew damn well that it wasn't going to activate and there never was going to be a 2x fork anyway and this bug was an intentional failsafe, or they really are that stupid to allow such a dumb error to be released into the wild.
Either way, what a colossal shitshow.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:02:34
That's only half the story. Time to propagate and mine is probably very similar on both sizes.
Demand for free/cheap space is higher than 2mb. If we went to 2mb the blocks would probably continue to be full, and the increase of the blockchain's size will just double and we're back here again in 12 months (probably less). There will always be a backlog. Bitcoin is suffering from its own popularity.
Some could argue that demand for free space is infinite. Maybe it is; I could back up my hard drive to the blockchain, but that's an extreme example.
I would personally love for everyone to transact for free, instantly on bitcoin. But obviously that massively harms decentralisation, at which point we then may as well go back to fiat.
It's a difficult problem to solve. Solutions are in the pipeline, the waiting, just, sucks, and yeah, moving money is more expensive than I'd like. But hey, given the the awesomeness that bitcoin will enable one day, I guess a little pain in the meantime isn't a big deal.

I usually look at that website as well to guesstimate a good fee as my wallet (ledger nano s) usually overestimates even on the slow setting. The text at the bottom of the website usually overestimates as well for my needs.
If I was sending something to a friend right now and it didn't really matter too much when it confirmed, I would pick something like 30 to 40 satoshis per byte and tell them to wait for a couple of days. Buying a game from steam I want to play in the next hour or so.. Maybe 100 to 200. Something like that.

It's okay, we were all new once.
Look at the previous downticks in price. The ETF nonsense earlier this year is probably the newest one. Plus China 'banning' Bitcoin yet again. JP Morgan saying it's a ponzi...
There is always bad news around bitcoin and it's future. Very occasionally we get some good news and that's when the price really skyrockets. But for every 1 bit of good news, 4 bits of bad come out. And yet bitcoin is still at this price, what does that tell you?
Although I'm probably old hat compared to others, even I was worried about the Segwit2x attack. And look, it didn't even happen. 
Now Roger is pumping his imitation bitcoin and the 'bcash is bitcoin' nonsense. Here we go again. Next week it'll be something else, maybe Europe will ban it this time.

You should probably upgrade eventually. The electrum servers will be updated with the new protocol and I'm unsure if it is backwards compatible. There isn't a rush currently though. Personally I'd wait for a point release or two to iron out any unknown bugs.
With all software that is important, you should stay *relatively* current and *somewhat* up to date. Not bleeding edge, not "omg new release must install today", but certinally not "5 years old".

If you want it to go quickly, you have to pay for it.
If it doesn't matter if it takes a few hours or whatever, you select a lower fee.
If your wallet has shit fee calculations then use another wallet.
Using Segwit also gives you a tidy discount.
Most I think I ever paid was around a $1.20ish. If you're paying 9 dollars you're probably doing something a bit wrong.

10 satoshis per byte is a really low fee for the current network conditions:
The network *tends* to be quieter during the weekend so if you can just hurry up and wait, it'll *probably* be confirmed by Monday without you having to do anything. If not then maybe start taking action.

In less than a year this whole drama won't matter.
Off chain scaling is absolutely the right way to go in my mind. I can keep running my node at home and do instant off chain coffee transactions using lightning network or whatever ends up being the solution.
I was thoroughly impressed with the elcair wallet and starblocks demo. This combined with the Segwit discount, schnorr signatures, and whatever other awesomeness in the next 12 months has very much convinced me that bitcoin has a very bright future. With the massive "if" of these technologies delivering on their claims. 
You can't get all this awesomeness by changing a 1 to an 8 and introducing even more centralisation into the network. Bitcoin is too centralised as it is, and I'm sure not moving to a even more centralised coin just because the fees are a little lower.

I sent money to my hot wallet yesterday before I went to bed. Paid a 30sat/byte-ish fee. It confirmed around 2am apparently.
If I wanted it faster I would've paid a 100sat/byte fee or something. I didn't care, so I didn't pay extra.


Check out Lightening network. There is a testnet wallet on Google Play if you have an Android device, and you can use it on the testnet starblocks website to instantly order and pay for coffee. I'm thinking we'll begin seeing stuff in less than 6 months now. And we'll see vendor adoption at around 6 months after that. But I'm just guessing with those timeframes.

If bitcoin had a blocksize increase then yeah, it would be cheaper right now. But you are ignoring all the downsides to doing this. And in a year or so, probably less, we'll be right back where we are, especially given Bitcoin's popularity.
If we're truly going to hit mainstream with this thing then being smarter about the problem is needed.
I'm not naive. I've done plenty of research and have concluded that smaller blocks are probably the better option for the time being whilst other innovations take place. I used to be a big blocker a couple of years ago ("why not just change a 1 to a X, how hard could it be?") but ultimately decided that was a wrong decision to fixing the issue.
In essence, as I see it, it comes down to this choice:
* Decentralised
* Free/cheap
* Scalable
Pick two.

He ignored me several times when I practically begged him to consider other viewpoints on the NYA and engage me in conversation around it. But he continued responding to borderline trolls that were insulting him. 
He still has not publicly apologised for his involvement in the farce that was Segwit2x and the NYA. This farce wasted countless thousands of hours and dollars in developer time and even delayed new features in the core client.

* Nothing
* It won't
* No
* No
So why fucking bother? The rich, including the Royal Family in this case, will continue to get more and more wealthy (wealth I'm *forced* to give them), and my wealth will dwindle as inflation eats away at it and there is nothing I can do about it. Unless of course I try to stop paying taxes, but of course the ways I would be able to stop paying are all illegal, naturally, so I'll get caught and thrown in jail. So either way I'm fucked.

Do you have to go down the 'blockstream propaganda' route? This has nothing to do with blockstream and the myth that they 'control' Bitcoin has been debunked so many times I'm not going to waste my time here.
Anyway, the problem is real. Millions of Americans cannot currently run a node at home due to bandwidth constraints from their ISP. If we had full 8mb blocks (for example) then even more wouldn't be able to run a node. Even I would struggle to run a node and I currently have plenty of bandwidth (I've had to limit the node to 25 connections though). So that's cheap and scalable ticked on my list, but not decentralised.
The blockchain is currently over 140gb, and increasing by roughly 52gb per year. At 8mb I would have to find the space and bandwidth for an extra 416gb. So I could maybe buy a 2tb drive that would last around 4 years. This would cost me roughly $70 or so. I may also have to be a non listening node as I wouldn't be able to share the history with other nodes as I certainly wouldn't have the bandwidth to spare anymore.
So $70 plus whatever upgrade from my isp I would need (which would be monthly ongoing cost) just to transact? Most people would be turned off by that and simply not run a node, or run a pruned node. And just like that, the decentralisation drops off that little bit more.
If decentralisation is important to you then this is a concern. If you're happy to allow expensive data centres to run a handful of nodes for you, then we're basically back to fiat, and I'm not keen on that solution.

Bitcoin is sound money. We know how much will exist at any rough given time frame. Currently, 12.5 new bitcoins are 'found' roughly every 10 minutes. This amount halves roughly every 4 years, and will 'top out' at just under 21 million in the year 2140. We can check and verify this in a trust-less way; we don't have to trust any Government or Bank, which may have reason to lie to us.
So next time Mr President wants to get us into another war or bail out X industry again, he just fires up the printing presses and creates as much money/debt as he wants out of thin air. Neat huh? Sadly that process devalues every dollar/whatever you own. On here is the amount you owe to someone, even though you never agreed to any of it: 
And be very thankful you don't live in Zimbabwe or Venezuela. Or Greece. Or Spain. Or Russia. Bitcoin forces honest money to exist; you can't cheat the math behind it. Bitcoin also doesn't care where you live, who you are, who you know. You want to send me bitcoin? Done. I want to send you bitcoin? Done. And we don't have to know a damn thing about each other than the 'receive' address the wallets give us.
But Bitcoin has a problem; *there isn't enough supply*. 1 Bitcoin being at under $8k is **absurdly** cheap to my eyes. There isn't even enough for every person my *my country* to own a whole bitcoin now or ever. When people finally pick up on this magic Internet money and finally think, "you know what, I should buy some" the price will be over $100k, probably closer to $500k. This isn't a bubble at all; Bitcoin is still finding it's price.
And the really cool thing; once Bitcoin hits those levels, I won't even have to transfer my wealth back to the government money to use it everywhere. "Oh, you want to buy this house, sir? You **do** have proof of funds, I assume? Oh, you a **whole** bitcoin you say? Right this way, sir, we have a special office just for you. *Turns to PA:* Cancel my 2 o clock please"
Bitcoin is unlocked a whole new level of awesome with money that humans have never attempted before. This is trust-less, independent, verifiable, can't-be-faked money. And if you get just 10% of how awesome this technology already is, and will become, then you'd think Bitcoin is undervalued too.

Well, during the chain fork.
A lot of Bitcoin Cash nodes struggled to connect for several hours.
Whilst I'm loathed to link the cesspool that is here is a post about someone having that issue, which was one of the first hits when I Google'd it: 
*Eventually* the nodes found other nodes that ran the same consensus rules. For some it took a few hours, for others, a few days. Obviously *now* everything is working okay, but it was a bit shaky for a while, which isn't how you want a well connected decentralised network to run.
Disconnecting nodes that you know will become non-compliant to your consensus rules actually seems like a good idea, especially doing it quickly without wasting time figuring out if you're on the same consensus rules or not. You maintain strong connections to nodes that behave and you reduce the chaos on the network come fork day.
And, of course, there are plenty of &lt;0.15 nodes that will still happily connect and play along. Even if that wasn't the case and every user suddenly upgraded to 0.15, people could easily spin up 0.14.2 nodes to help out the segwit2x nodes.

@_date: 2017-09-16 22:09:12
Your technicals are correct mostly correct, but you're forgetting the politics.
Miners cannot spoof anything if by spoofing you mean making fake transactions to steal money. This would only work if the nodes were in on the act and allowing it to happen. Which, as far as a I know, neither core or 2x nodes do. 
Also, the users have more power than you are giving credit for.
Remember miners have bills to pay. If users refuse to use 2x it will have no value and they have to mine proper bitcoin to keep the lights on.
Also, although no miner will admit it, there is a feeling from some that the UASF bip148 client lit a fire under their ass and forced them to activate segwit. I was against this client but am grateful for segwit all the same. 
It's a big ole game of chicken. It wouldn't shock me to see 2x largely abandoned before November. In fact I hope this happens.
The miners, whilst they do an important job, need to be reminded of their place; they work for the users and the larger network, they do not 'set policy' as they seem to think they do. If they want to get paid they should do their job and not play politics and block progress. But that's just my opinion. They have too much power as you rightly identify and we have far too much miner centralisation on the network.
This makes me want to switch to Vertcoin, but I'm not brave enough to do that yet. Yet... 
Going to bed now.

This is different. Nobody is in charge here. You can't 'call the boss' and get a decision real quick.
By design, bitcoin is very difficult to change. That's a good thing but also a bloody pain if stuff needs changing.
The nodes that core write are critical to the health of the network. They validate everything and they ensure your bitcoin isn't stolen by some attack. Core nodes are over 90% of the network.
Imagine you wanted to invent html6. You get a whole bunch of people in a room and come up with the spec. Lovely. Oh wait, you didn't invite any Chrome or Firefox or Edge developers. And they all think your design sucks. Guess who isn't writing support for html 6 into their browsers. Well shit, now you have a bit of a problem, don't you? But, Cloudflare and GoDaddy said they will only serve html6 from now on (I know that's technically 'wrong', bear with me, I'm tired and too lazy to fix the analogy now I've committed).
So now you have some big names in the industry using your html6. But no fucker is running software that will accept html6 and you're having a hard time getting them to switch to Opera, the one browser that supports html6. Well, this is a fine old mess, isn't it?
So you have an Internet that supports a standard nobody understand or users, but you've forced a bunch of hosts to only support html6. And this goes live in less than 2 months.
At some point, something has to give.

I do love a fresh core release!
If you're already set up on Ubuntu using the [PPA](
* quit Bitcoin Core
* in a Terminal, enter these two commands:
* sudo apt update
* sudo apt dist-upgrade
* and then start Bitcoin Core.
The UTXO database format has dramatically changed in 0.15. So if you're upgrading expect to see this window for a few minutes:
Just let it do it's thing and everything is fine. I shut down everything else on that machine in order to make it go as quickly as possible. Looks like it'll take about 5 minutes on my system, which isn't bad. On slow machines you can expect a longer wait; it's a fairly major operation.
Fresh installs won't have to do this work. But will be able to sync the blockchain much faster than &lt;= 0.14.x clients thanks in (large) part to this change. A lot of neat performance improvements are in this release.
This release also addresses the exploit around excessive memory usage discussed at Breaking Bitcoin, although I personally never had an issue, you should upgrade to this version anyway, just for that reason alone if nothing else.
Another reason is that 0.15 will now automatically disconnect BCash and Segwit2x nodes as soon as it sees them, instead of waiting for invalid data before banning them. This should improve the state of the overall network as big network reorganisations are less likely.
**Keep those bastards honest ladies and gents: Run a full node, enforcing proper consensus. The more nodes we have, the more secure, and safer store of your wealth, Bitcoin becomes. Even if you don't directly use the node software, run a full node anyway if you can. Damn near any computer made in the past decade will do fine.**

why indeed would miners push for this if it hurts the bottom line? Why not just agree to signal segwit and go from there? Why have a meeting, specifically without at least one core developer present?
From a purely economic perspective, this doesn't make sense, does it? If anything, they should form a unofficial agreement to miner *smaller* blocks and continue without segwit.
Introduce politics, alongside previous statements of wanting to 'fire' core and it begins to make a bit more sense, doesn't it? If we can get everyone running our software, even if it costs us, we suddenly have a lot more pull on the network.
And why does bch have to exist? Wasn't the entire point of this thing to prevent a hard fork? Yet bitmain's main pool creates this altcoin. Very odd behaviour, isn't it?
And I come back to my original point. If a handful of people can control a decentralised currency like Bitcoin in this manner, then the Bitcoin experiment has failed and it's worthless. Even if you 'like' 2x for whatever reason, this type of power grab should gravely concern you. If miners can do this, corporations and governments can do this. At that point we may as well just switch back to fiat.

Very little. A lot of services are capped at 250gb. That's barely enough for a node currently, even then you'd have to lower the default number of connections in the config file to limit the use.
And, of course, you might actually want to, you know, use your Internet as well as run a node.
Like you, I too have unmetered Internet. Remember that the rest of the world isn't as fortunate. Even good old USA.
I don't even know the situation in places like Africa, Eastern Europe, New Zealand or Australia. Maybe for some it's no issue. Maybe for some the situation is even worse.
Every requirement increase to run a node makes it less likely someone, somewhere, will be able to run a node. Sometimes the tradeoff is worth it. Sometimes not.
The less nodes we have, more less censorship resistant and centralised Bitcoin becomes.

When I said "Ledger" I meant "the ledger wallet software"
You can access the same coins on the ledger wallet software and electrum and happily switch between the two. Just stop one app, start the other, everything is there and no confusion with change addresses. However, I think that situation may have changed with the segwit upgrade and I'm thinking that probably won't work on the electrum side (it will look for the non-segwit addresses only, I think). Personally I haven't used Electrum for months. I wanted the fine grain control it gave me, but honestly it wasn't worth messing around with it. "Let it go", as they say.
And yes, you'll need to move the coins from your existing wallet into the address given to you by the ledger software/electrum once you have it set up. Recommend you do a very small transfer to test first, and then send the rest. I don't think the ledger uses 12 words (it's 24 if I remember correctly)  and as you say, it's best to keep the recovery seed offline at all times, so even if you could restore to the nano, you probably don't want to.

Segwit had economic majority and user majority support. It was also optional for the users to participate and was a soft fork. The miners did indeed 'pass' the upgrade as it was becoming clear the users were getting fed up of the bullshit and them blocking progress for the political reasons.
2x is a power grab by a small group of miners and does not have large economic or user support. Nobody consulted anyone outside the meeting in New York. They emerged with a signed paper saying 'this is what bitcoin will become because we are the miners and we say so!' this goes against the very essence of what bitcoin is.
If bitcoin can be changed in this way by a small group of people in a closed room meeting then it has failed.
If you cannot understand this difference you are being willfully ignorant.

No. They are effectively saying that is one of the core parts of the coin is compromised, it's ASIC resistance, then they will hard fork. Vertcoin is basically Litecoin but with ASIC resistance.
In the same way the Bitcoin community would almost certainly backlash against anyone suggesting changing the 21 million coin limit now, or 'liberating' Satoshi's coins, the Vertcoin community would backlash against any ASIC technology being released for it.

I don't have any fake accounts. I have a bunch of old accounts (as previously mentioned), but I overwrite the reddit entry on my lastpass when I swap. I have no idea what the account passwords are and would be completely unable to access them again as the password is generated fresh by lastpass each time.

Hi Eric,
I'll try to be a tad more civil than the parent commenter. Shouldn't be difficult.
This was typed on my phone and is more of a brain dump. Please excuse any (hopefully) humours autocorrected errors.
I think a big chunk of the community simply struggles to understand your actions.
The entire point of bitcoin is that no one person, or small group of people can control it, or direct it. This way a government or malicious actor would find it very difficult to co-opt bitcoin in a way that benefits them. This is how it should be, but damn it can make things tricky. 
So why, even with perhaps good intentions, you can continue to support 2x, an 'upgrade' that was conceived by a group of less than 20 people (correct me if that number is incorrect) in a closed door meeting without the input of the wider community, any of the developers, or indeed the wider economy is just beyond me. Ironically, the NYA event was even called consensus! 
I understand the need to compromise. I honestly 'get' what your motivations are. But when we're less than a month away, a tiny fraction of the community has even 'upgraded' their nodes, the futures markets are telling us loud and clear what they prefer and some exchanges are flat out refusing to even list the 2x coin and worse still, it's so obviously, painfully clear that this is an incredibly contentious hard fork... I have to ask... Why is reversing course and just stating 'you know what guys and girls, we got it wrong. Segwit is finally live so I guess that's a win but we got the second part wrong, let's not do this until we've worked out some of these issues' so impossible?
Better still, the big blockers who hate Segwit have bitcoin cash. And the small blockers have Segwit. Everyone has the system they want. Segwit2x doesn't even have an audience now. 
It's okay to change ones mind after events and new information come to light, really, we'd have a lot more respect for backtracking in those circumstances than blindly going along a dangerous path when all signals are screaming at you that this is now the wrong decision.
It seems to me that only the people who want to 'fire core' stand to benefit from this. Everyone else suffers. And even then I'd say they would be shooting themselves in the foot.
So please, help me and the community understand, why, after everything that has happened, is this still continuing? Why is it so impossible to change course now?
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:55:56

In vertcoin's case, possibly, yes. Would we be doing a pow change if the miners decided to try to increase the 21 million coin cap? I'd say there is a red line for most coins, somewhere.


A good point. I'd argue being asic resistant helps to achieve that goal. Apparently monero somehow manages this to an extent as it is largely not advantageous to bother with asic mining. You can asic mine, but there isn't a huge advantage to doing so. Again maybe monero's relative newness and the fact they do a hard fork every 6 months prevents ASICs from being built.
Vertcoin's price has rallied a bit in recent days. I think it's safe to say that the people who bought it are in two camps: those who saw what was happening and wanted to make a quick profit. And those who are sick of the shenanigans of the miners and wanted out.

I was actually against uasf and Luke's silly assertion that the majority supported it when the node count was far below 50%.
People running that software would have found themselves split from the network with no new blocks and everyone else would have carried on without them. It probably would have been a none event.
We may have got Segwit in 2018, as I think a second wave of uasf would have been more successful.

Bitcoin is more than just 'an investment' it's a whole new way of doing the whole money thing that humanity has never seen before. This is more important than the price of bitcoin against fiat in my opinion.
But to answer your question, remember that bitcoin was in a 2 year bear market after mtgox went under. There is nothing preventing an event of that magnitude happening again. Basically, if you care about the fiat value of bitcoin, this is extremely high risk as an investment. It's moon or bust.

That chart is simply a percentage of Segwit transactions currently. Aka: people who have bothered to upgrade wallets yet. It doesn't support your argument in the slightest.

Not many 2x compatible nodes there. And yet the 'majority supports it'. You can run 2x on a drastically centralised  network with hardly any nodes if you really want. You'll be able to send some coins to Craig.

It's creating a change address. This is normal for electrum.
I sends the money to the recipient, and then the remainder of whatever was in the source address(es) to the change address which it generates for you and you control.
This enhances privacy as it's tricky to determine which address is yours and which is going to the recipient. Well, not in this specific case, but it is normally helpful.

Making a ASIC for Vertcoin is difficult. It's not just "I can make an ASIC for anything", it doesn't work like that. With all the money and hash power that's in Ethereum right now, why are there no ASICs for it? Why still stuck on GPUs? Both Ethereum and Vertcoin have ASIC resistant proof of work.
Even then, if someone succeeds and spends hundreds of thousdands of dollars on doing it, Vertcoin will simply hard fork to a new POW. They've already done it once, they can and will do it again. With that threat in place, I doubt anyone will throw the money into it when coins like SIA are wanting more ASICs in place.
The only real issue in my mind is people having warehouses of GPU rigs instead of warehouses of ASICS and therefore making it unprofitable to mine at home again. That problem is difficult to solve and so I'm not totally sold on it being a solution, but merely a step along the path.

You now have two wallets with your private keys. Let's hope neither of them has a security flaw which causes problems.
The only reason that feature exists is for recovery. The 'my hd drive and my bitcoin was on there' recovery.
Having two wallets controlling the same keys is somewhat asking for trouble. Imagine if one used Segwit change addresses and the other one didn't.
You're unlikely to lose the coins, per say, but it will result in a frustrating experience in some niche cases, as you are experiencing.

This exchange specifically states that they will not assist in this exact situation unless the amount is over 5k.
I'm not saying it's a 'good' or even that it's 'good service'. Nowhere am I arguing that. I don't know why the arbitrary 5k minimum exists to be perfectly honest.
I'm stating the facts. OP fucked up, did the thing bittrex warned him about not doing, and won't help as per policy. Bittrex are following the policy that OP agreed to and was reminded of when depositing. We probably shouldn't expect them to do anything else.
OP should really be lawyering up if he's serious about recovery. Instead apparently crying about it on reddit is the answer.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:58:39


the Litecoin project is the one they’d could likely join. 
And have the exact same issues with the same miners as they did on bitcoin.
The road to segwit on litecoin was much shorter than bitcoin, but it wasn't exactly smooth either. And guess what? The miners were the problem again. Someone even started registering litecoin unlimited domains...
If bitcoin developers leave, they should move to something that actually solves this problem.

It pulls power away from Governments who just print more and more money because banks are 'too big to fail', or we need to go to war for 'WMD's that Saddam can have ready in 45 minutes' or whatever other excuse we need to raise the debt ceiling this year (why even have a ceiling if it just gets raised every time?) and devalue your savings as a result.
Damn right we're excited. If that looks cult-like to you and others then I guess I can accept that for all the mind blowing awesomeness that is coming our way. 
Maybe in the future you'll 'get' at least 10% of the awesome this technology enables, and maybe we won't look so crazy. Maybe.

The more nodes there are, the most decentralised Bitcoin becomes. The more decentralised Bitcoin becomes, the harder it is to take over, disrupt, coerce etc. by malicious actors. 
If you have, say, 15 nodes on the network, you could *probably* force them offline through technical or political measures. If you have 15,000 nodes, well, that's a lot more difficult.
The same can be said for miners. Sadly I feel mining is far too centralised in Bitcoin. Hopefully this situation will improve.

The very fact you are running core is enough to 'express' it. Upgrading to 0.15 would reduce the network "turbulance" from the Segwit2X clients come fork day. as they would be pre-disconnected in advance.
You can add the uacomment if you want to really drive the point home, I guess. Ensure the setting is in all caps (NO2X) as that's what others are using, and you may as well be uniform for those who might be tracking these things.

I didn't sign it. Did you?
It was signed by a bunch of suites in a closed door meeting who basically sat down in a room and said 'this is what bitcoin is now'. 
That's not consensus. That's a hostile takeover attempt from the very idiots who have been blocking progress for over a year. These people do not dictate what Bitcoin is.
Regardless of the 'need' of how full the blocks are etc. this is wrong and goes against the very essence of what Bitcoin is and what it stands for.
This is nothing more than a power grab and should *always* be rejected and fought against.

I don't fully understand your question. I'm kinda tired, sorry. I'll give it a go. Expand further if this doesn't hit the mark. But I am going to bed soon so I might keep you waiting for an answer.
If you have 51% of the hash rate, you could effectively censor transactions. You could orphan a block that includes transactions you don't want going through by out competing the rest of the network. You remine the block, then mine the next, and the next until you have the longest chain, wiping out the competing blocks. This becomes easier as you get more hashing power. You could even halt the whole network by mining empty blocks only and ensuring only your blocks are used.
The nodes validate everything. This is why, if at all practical, you should run your own node. This way the node will only accept valid data and you don't trust anyone.
You could possibly partition the network if you own enough nodes and maybe these nodes only see blocks you want them to see. Some sucker connects to your malicious nodes only and they only see the blocks you want them to see. Maybe you're mining a minority chain, but honest nodes wouldn't necessarily see the longer chain as they only see your malicious ones. I'd say being a state level actor with nodes inside a countrywide firewall that you control would give you the best chance of pulling this off. 
Imagine that. China partitions off the bitcoin network. China nodes and world nodes don't see each other. You effectively have two bitcoin networks. After a while, difficultly adjusts down on both sides, but China bitcoin has more hashing power overall. Then, after a year, China decides to relax the firewall rules. World nodes finally connect to China nodes and freak the fuck out: "holy shit I'm following the wrong damn chain with less proof of work. Best get this latest data from this new node and switch over to that chain". In this situation, these China nodes don't have to be malicious, they just never saw blocks with your transactions in them, but they just happened to have the longest chain with the most proof of work. A whole year of transactions, gone. Holy shit. Thanks China.
In theory those reversed transactions could be re transmitted and hopefully the fees are still okay to be mined. But damn, what a mess.
This situation actually happens every now and then naturally, but on a much smaller scale. Usually two blocks are found at roughly the same time and the network sorts itself out when the next block is found as they discard one side for the other. Remember each block has to build off the previous one.
Both of these attacks are expensive currently. Massive hashing rate in bitcoin makes the mining attack very costly, and the more nodes you have, the harder it would be to partition them off so they can't see each other. 
These attacks are probably unlikely. But remember a state actor made the stuxnet worm to infect millions of ordinary computers just to specifically target very specific hardware in Iran's nuclear facilities. So some paranoia is probably healthy when money and pissed off state level actors are involved.
The best defence is more nodes and more hashing power to make these attacks difficult and expensive.
In short, more decentralisation is desirable to prevent large scale attacks on the network. And to reduce trust. It's a difficult thing to get right.

@_date: 2017-10-23 06:06:51


Parameters set! 


I'd probably just switch client that met my needs, but was still currently compatible, (so bitcoin unlimited equivalent I guess) and the wider community itself would 'fire core', slowly but surely. We'd gradually transfer over and there would be a sudden change right at the end, I'd guess.
If it was clear from all signals that I was in the minority I would probably just switch to Litecoin or Vertcoin. Maybe monero. Probably vertcoin, I love vertcoin even though I can hardly use it anywhere, which is a shame.
The awesome thing is, that unlike my national currency, I'm not forced into using it. I can just change if and when it suites me. I could swap back into bitcoin if I have a vendor that doesn't take my coin of choice (plenty of options with that, including shapeshift.io of course) and I'd transact 'natively' in my chosen coin where possible and practical, just like I do now with Bitcoin. I would of course favour my coin of choice and would preference vendors who took it where practical.
With atomic swaps on the horizon it won't even matter for much longer. Run out of bitcoin? Alright, I'll swap to litecoin today and the vendor still gets the coin of choice . Software does it all for me. Awesomeness.
In my view if the community 'turns' on core then there will be an exodus. Just like there was from digg to reddit. Just with money instead. Will be one hell of a spectacle!

That 30% you keep quoting was miner signalling, not community demand, which was much higher.
The miners were blocking progress, even though segwit was opt in. If you don't like segwit for whatever reason, you don't have to use it.
Very soon, the miners will be reminded of their role in the ecosystem. If they want to get paid, they must do their job. They are not in control of Bitcoin. The sooner they realise that, the better for everyone.

hrmmm. Maybe. Your comment prompted me to research a little and I found this: 
It does seem to vaguely make sense. But I'm no expert on hashing so I've had to take what I could understand at face value.
That, plus the community's seemingly strong will to remain ASIC resistant at all costs would suggest to me that nobody in the real world would create an ASIC for the coin. And if they did, they would remain very quiet about it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:17:51

@_date: 2017-10-28 14:50:27
You make some good points. Thanks.
Although I'd say that being ASIC resistant is not a fools errand as you suggest. Especially if it's one of the pillars of the entire project, like the 21 million coin limit is on Bitcoin. People would work hard to protect that limit if it ever came under fire, as they would with the ASIC resistance.
So are we essentially doomed, in your view, to always be at the mercy of miners with massive warehouses of ASICs no matter what we do? That's not a future that I want for my currency, if I'm honest. I'm just trading one dictator of my money for another.
