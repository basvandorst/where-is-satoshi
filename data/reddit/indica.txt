Really cool scenario - the kind of post this subreddit needs.

Anyone else envision the Okay guy?
I'll see myself out.

You had me until the utopia part.  Human nature isn't all sunshine and roses.  The more power we have, the more powerful both good AND evil become.  I'm probably reading too much into your post but the suggestion that the state is the root of evil seems naive.

That's true, but state or no state, people will be in a position of power over others.  Picture a global economic meltdown and a breakup of governments globally.  It would be chaos and warlord-type people with lots of weapons would take over.  The fact is, humanity as a system is more stable when someone is "in charge" because there is less in-fighting.  Power strata will always exist.  That said, bitcoin is awesome because it can undermine such structures in a peaceful way.

I see bitcoin strictly as an investment tool because I'm not too optimistic about its future as a currency.  I think as more people use it, more will abuse it (say, soliciting ransom in BTC), and governments will eventually put enough pressure on mtgox and others, driving the value down by scaring off investors.

How long does it take for USD to get withdrawn?  I've been waiting 5 weeks now.
I'd be super grateful if anyone can give me any kind of answer based on their experience.  All my posts have fallen on deaf ears.  I have 7K in the lurch and bills to pay. Gox won't give me an estimate.

Find the guy and kneecap him.

It hit $30 a few minutes ago then dipped negligibly.
