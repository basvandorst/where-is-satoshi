The disruptive technology behind bitcoin will not go away.
Bitcoins have not a long history like gold and have not the same type of "uniqueness". Meaning, bitcoin could be replaced by a different blockchain and people might not care if the other blockchain is more efficient (myspace-scenario).
Governments might make bitcoin illegal. Probably won't happen because governments like cryptocurrency because it is actually quite traceable.

Bitcoin doesn't have consensus by developers. Thus there is a lot of propaganda being thrown around.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:20:56


That is correct, your funds would be save. But it is a privacy problem if all your transactions would go through payment hubs that are monitored by the government.
However, I am curious how things will work out in the future. Maybe it is not bad to have several solutions and let the market decide. In my opinion Segwit2x is a good compromise that allows to develop LNs while maintaining on-chain scaling in the meantime. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:36:28

@_date: 2017-08-10 06:21:58


It was quite obvious that segwit alone wouldn't reach consensus (see eg Hongkong agreement that some of the core developers attended). It was the arrogance to push the core agenda onto the community while fighting any competition, which delayed scaling.
Anyway, it might be good for bitcoin to have a slower adoption rate in order to prevent governments from panicking.

In my opinion, any possible client software should be available to users so that the market can decide on bitcoin scaling. Bitcoin core is fighting for maintaining a monopoly on whatever they define as the "true" bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:45:18


The chain with the most hashpower.


Bitcoin's fate can always be steered by the absolute majority (&gt;50%). This is the fundamental principle of bitcoin. I don't care whether this leads to hard forks every week.
The economic incentives are strong enough to prevent disastrous hard forks if the technological gain is not strong enough or the outcome of the fork is not clear enough.


The minority chain is responsible for replay protection.
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:25:12
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:09:43
I agree. But the longest history of bitcoin is not that strong yet. And there infinite possibilities to define a cryptocurrency but only a handful of rare metals.
It would be great for bitcoin if it would be more visible that it accumulated the most proof of work in the universe. But it is difficult to compare with other cryptocurrencies.

Yes, most core developers have been fighting additional on-chain scaling since years. Besides wonky decentralisation arguments and risks of hard forks I still don't really understand why. Many theories about hidden agendas are flying around and that core wants a fee market for LN to work.

The problem is that nobody knows whether the Lightning Network will ever be accepted in a useful way in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It requires complex accounting and software solutions that automize channel management.
With a small blocksize, Lightning Networks could lead to a centralized hub and spokes network. In this case you need to be connected to big payment hubs that are centralized and susceptible to government control.

I assume it is used as protection against strong hashrate fluctuations. But it could also make the BCH chain more attractive for miners. However a shorter block time would also put pressure on the price because of more newly minted coins. Difficult to predict the outcome...

I am pretty sure that everybody knew that segwit increases effective blocksize. It was repeated over an over and over.
The reason people rejected it was
A) the fear for a lack of future on-chain scaling.

Seriously face reality.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:46:00
There is a reason for this because many people are worried that "core" (define as you like) will sabotage further on-chain scaling after segwit activates.

Such a minority chain would not be viable because of the slow difficulty adjustment. This is not ethereum.

This is only remotely linked and I don't really understand what you want to say. Orphaned blocks always happen and are not a problem at all at 10 MB or even 50 MB blocksize.

@_date: 2017-07-29 22:16:14
If the hashrate adjusts and both chain have 10 minute blocks, you would expect the hashrate would be distributed according to the price (currently BCH is approximately 12% of BTC price).
BCH has the catch that the difficulty decreases fast but increases slowly. Thus the block time might get shorter than 10 minutes which would attract more mining power.

@_date: 2017-07-25 05:49:24
My prediction is that around 70% of users support the 2x hard fork. Which would mean a chain split in November.
And ~10-20%  of users want BCC. So we might see a chain split already in a week.
But after all the infighting, a chain split might be a good solution. If it generates an altcoin with &lt;20% of bitcoin market cap,  this shouldn't lead to a loss of trust in bitcoin. Bad would be if there is no clear winner.

Bitcoin is a hedge against the current financial system and store of value. And it is pretty good in doing this.

This is another one of the broken records that is getting boring. My comment was refering to the client and not developers.
And regarding the block size increase: fees of more than a few cent are a strong indication for me that we need more on-chain scaling as intermediate solution. The claim that some people think this is unnecessary is exactly why we have segwit2x now. See my previous comments. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:55:12


What I am saying is that there are plenty of good valid reasons for on-chain scaling.
But if the details are too complicated for you, feel free to blame it on Chinese people saving face.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:01:22
There will be plenty of whining until November. And after that the bitcoin soap opera will certainly find a new tiny unimportant detail to argue about.
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:23:31
It was a very rational fear given the behavior of many core developers.

Segwit2x consensus breaking... not really.

@_date: 2017-07-18 19:41:01
Bitcoin works by the most proof-of-work. This is determined by a mixture of hashpower and economic incentives defined by users.
There should be no forced consensus by whatever a group of developers want. Ideally any possible bitcoin implementation should be available so users and miners can decide.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:19:40


No, because of the lack of the promised on-chain scaling hardfork.

Yes, fun times. Better than any soap opera.

Yes, very entertaining conspiracies. Just funny how he argues how Garzik wants to take over bitcoin and then claims that it is not possible anyway... lol
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:58:40
If you don't like Segwit2x just sell the coins on the 2x chain after the hardfork. 
Why would you need to "stop" it?
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:06:30


There is no link for this. I just wanted to express that it makes little difference what bridge is being build for scaling bitcoin. It is all better than being stuck for another 2 years and not getting across the river.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:36:19
Don't use a paper wallet generator without checking the code first.
Just kidding... nobody does that. The whole system is based on trusting that someone else would find out about a broken wallet generator before your coins are stolen.
Same goes for hardware wallets. They are more difficult to manipulate but it is also more difficult to find manipulations.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:37:23


Yeah sure, because the 1.5x transaction increase through Segwit which was needed one year ago is certainly enough scaling. Let's just wait another few years. /s

@_date: 2017-07-04 08:01:49
If you have to ask this question here, there is a high chance that you are not running an exchange or mining business.
If this is the case it is quite pointless for you to run a node. You might just lose money if you actually use your node for transactions after Aug 1st.

This is simply not true. But probably you will come up with an abstruse definition of "fail".

The current scaling has marginal effects on centralization, which I agree is an independent problem.
The majority wants some intermediate on-chain scaling of bitcoin now. (or a year ago)

Well, segwit2x will make it possible within just a few months.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:12:59
I never claimed that. I am pretty sure the majority of users supports segwit.
But the majority of users also wants a blocksize increase hardfork.

Together with a big part of the economy they are changing the protocol. See NY agreement.

Lower fees, faster confirmation times. No downsides except a tiny bit less decentralization (which I assume the economy does not care about).

Segwit by itself is certainly not a compromise.

UASF gives only insignificant power to (nonmining) users. It might give some extra power to exchanges. The name is quite misleading for political reasons. We could call it the bitcoin patriot act.

If you make these claims please provide examples. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:39:58
Do you really believe the Segwit2x hardfork leads to miner centralization because of a doubled blocksize?
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:08:33
Transferwise offers fees below 1% and no currency spreads. I don't think that is possible with one of the bitcoin services (we are talking about transfer between national currencies, not the bitcoin transaction itself).
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:09:44
In the end it is mostly about electricity costs. So you would need to change to something that does not rely on electricity to avoid centralization.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:45:00
Bitmain wanted bigger blocks long before Asicboost existed (see Hongkong agreement). There is still no evidence that Asicboost is actually used.
Edit: Looks like both BitcoinXT and the first Asicboost patents were published in 2015 (thanks u/ajtowns). I believe Asicboost was too much in its infancy to be the cause for the scaling wars. A case for the bitcoin historians.
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:08:57
Segwit2x has support from many exchanges and more than 80% of the mining hashpower. This makes it much more save that Segwit by itself that only has around 35% miner support.

After the hard fork you would have coins on both chains. If you transact with your outdated client you are susceptible to replay attacks, which could lead to loss of your coins on the other chain. 
If the other chain is worth more than your chain, you could lose a large chunk of your bitcoin.

You mean a fixed bitcoin amount? Would be too much of a gamble. Might end up with a 100% rent increase within a year.

@_date: 2017-07-16 13:49:00


Even with 10 MB blocks I can run a full node with a 300 USD computer and 20 USD/month internet. I do not see how bitcoin could be attacked under these circumstances.
Regarding block propagation delays for miners I also do not see that 10 MB block size would lead to significant more centralization.
I see Segwit2x as an intermediate scaling solution and wouldn't support blocksize increases faster than Kryder's law (Moores law for data storage). In the long run I hope for 2nd layer solutions but I am sceptical whether lightining networks will deliver this.

@_date: 2017-06-16 19:22:35
It is 2017. One hour of Netflix streaming is ~1 GB. Even in the US you can get internet without data caps in most places.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:51:34
Hopefully Core will integrate the 2 MB hardfork. Otherwise we will end up with bitcoin and bitcoin classic.
It would be nice to see Core helping to keep the community together. But there are a lot of egos involved 
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:09:59
In my opinion it should be ok if an interested computer geek can run a full node. The majority of users will not run it anyway (also not with 1 MB blocks).
You can always check important transactions with different web-based blockexplorers and SVP clients.

The empasis in my comment is on **between national currencies**. 
I would love to use bitcoin for this, but is currently not competitive for remittance. But I am happy to see an example where it works. Let's say 2000 USD from the US to my grandma in India that wants to pay her rent in Indian rupees.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:20:37
By a lot of measures there is more consensus on segwit2x than on segwit alone.
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:34:06
Because it is against your world view or do you have something to support this claim?
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:52:39
Most of Europe can do bank transfers without fees. Same in Asia with Alipay and Wechat payments.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:33:46
Losing support from whom? From people who want a chain split? 
I am pretty sure the chain with larger blocks will have higher economical value.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:25:57
Would be nice to see the percentage of users actually running full nodes. I am pretty sure it is negligible.
You can always confirm the validity of transactions by using an SVP client + different block explorer websites. It would be difficult for an attacker to manipulate all these sources simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:30:16
Bitcoin is quite resistant to opinion manipulation. Even with all the moderation in this sub it was not possible to enforce segwit by itself.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:08:02
Very well summarized. 
Personally, I think Bitcoin is strong enough to evolve with 51% hard-forks whenever necessary. At least this is how the technology works in the long term. In the short term it could lead to economic instabilities that the market doesn't like.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:07:17
Are you mining? Or are you running a business or exchange with it?
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:50:11
Ideally Bitcoin should work in a world where *any possible client* is available. Users and Miners should decide which client to run.
There is no element in Bitcoin that allows developers to chose the future of bitcoin. They can try by advertising their client. But it would be nice if they would be neutral and provide what the market wants.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:06:42
Thanks. I was looking at the asicboost whitepaper, which is from March 2016 (after the Hongkong agreement). 
BitcoinXT started mid of 2015, so slightly before Bitmain's patent. I don't believe at that time it was foreseeable which scaling solution would influence asicboost.
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:21:54
This are very good points and I totally agree that hardforks are extremely disruptive. But apparently the non-segwit blocksize increase was important enough for the community to reach consensus.
Unfortunately, the fundamental working principle of bitcoin makes it impossible to protect it from 51% hard-forks.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:58:07
Being experienced doesn't mean that you cannot have a recent reddit account. Especially in this forum.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:57:28
Bitmain is supporting Segwit2x, which also blocks Asicboost. I don't really see a problem here.
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:59:56
Thanks, interesting read. At least it shows that covert Asicboost could be activated in a comparibly simple way with additional software.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:11:15
Interesting approach. It would add a proof of stake component to bitcoin upgrades.
Maybe it would be nicer to risk only a tiny amount of your BTC used for voting (like 0.1% or less). Otherwise people might not vote.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:35:10


It was communicated constantly in a more and more annoying way.
 Unfortunately the blocksize for non-segwit transactions is not increased sufficiently. And this is what a significant part of the community wanted and which was leading to the stalling.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:44:38
Unfortunately they are still faster and cheaper when transfering money between two national currencies. (Would be happy to see a calculation that refutes this!)
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:46:54
I am pretty sure the market already predicted the end of "the big bitcoin stalling" a few months ago.
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:11:44
You mean like rejecting previously valid blocks?
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:29:51
The majority of the community is not fine with it. See eg here:
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:22:29


That's fair. But it is still one of the better measures of economic consensus that I know of.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:01:35
Well done, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:30:48
A market is the sum of buyers and sellers.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:39:08
This question is asked in a ridiculous biased way. And the poll was only spread in one part of the community.
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:13:00
Thanks! We are all one bitcoin team. The enemy is not the person in your team who supports a slightly different scaling solution.
More energy should be used to bring bitcoin forward and protect it from people who actually want to shut it down.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:44:19


Oh, we changed from the story of "economic majority"? I am happy to move on to the next thing that fits your narrative.
Users maybe? Luke Jr's biased but Sybil-free poll? Choose what you like.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:39:53
You are susceptible to replay attacks after the HF. But you know that.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:31:15
Yes, and it seemed a bit unclear whether the 80% include signalling from other segwit clients. Currently it looks like other clients are included. Please correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:35:07
No, there has always been a significant part of the community supporting a hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:53:58
No, it was critical remarks about the Lightning Network. You have clearly no idea what is going on here.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:59:19
There are no signs of asicboost being used and Bitmain supports segwit2x, which stops asicboost.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:42:07
It goes both ways. Many people will sell coins on a minority chain that can easily be attacked by miners.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:41:42
Do you have any insider information? Or just FUD?
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:25:20
I guess a lot of the GPU miners are kids who steal some electricity from their parents to increase their allowance.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:16:42
What are you going to fight against after the HF? 
You should find a new topic to block bitcoin progress.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:21:26


Hopefully Segwit2x will activate before that (which interestingly contains Segwit so your comment doesn't really make sense).
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:48:11
OK,  for you 2000000 byte base size and 8000000 byte max weight.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:45:12


In order to end 2 years of stalling bitcoin innovation.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:43:19
This UASF cult is just ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:15:56


Yay, conspiracy theories! Do you have any insider information on this? Or are you just spreading FUD?
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:20:13
It is a good skill in live to be able to listen to an opposing opinion that is against your world view. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:07:58
The weight per company is shown when you click the "?" next to the "Enable Weighting" button. Not sure how it is calculated, but I assume by the transaction volume of the companies.
So far Coin Dance tried to stay neutral in the debate. I would trust this more than a wiki run by one of the sides in the debate. But it is always good to get information from as many sources as possible.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:55:20
You made a concession. It is only called compromise if it would have led to the settlement of the dispute. Your concession did not reach consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:34:46
I agree with all of that. However, Segwit alone cannot scale more in the future (on-chain).
Many people were concerned that there would be no further on-chain scaling after segwit (especially after the desaster of the HK agreement).
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:41:19


If you don't have secret insider information: don't start trading!
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:32:49


I am a user and support Segwit2x. I find it extremely arrogant that you pretend to talk for me.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:05:59
Segwit2x is supported by way more economy than one guy.
And even if it was secured by only 1 person it would be a higher risk to the minority chain.
But apparently you know the future. So please sell all your "Jihans's altcoin" and earn money.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:35:49
Most of the world has no data caps. This is only a US thing and also slowly disappearing. 
10 MB blocks are 500 GB per year, which is ok even for a private person to maintain. This would allow to bridge the next 4 years until we have more serious  scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:21:55
No, tell me about it!
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:16:40
Interesting idea. Would be interesting to see some time estimates about when an average bitcoin address can be cracked.
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:14:43
You blocked progress by desperately fighting for partial scaling solutions that couldn't reach consensus. And by rejecting all the alternatives.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:08:33
There is a lot of incentive to keep coins on the most secure chain with the highest hash rate. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:27:05
I thought nobody believes anymore in the tale of the spam attacks.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:04:38
I believe for lightning networks to be succesful they need to be invisible to the user. I don't want to deal with opening payment channels to pay my coffee or pay my friend bob for sport tickets.
In order to be efficient, lightning networks require complicated software solutions. It has to be seen whether there is enough fee pressure to develop these solutions.
