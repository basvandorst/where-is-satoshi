They underestimate the number of lawsuits , if they fuck everyone like that , haircut of more than 30% is completely unacceptable,they must put down at least 30-40 million of company money and personal money if they are going to fuck the customers , they will be ruining lives and news's of lives lost and other tragic stories will end them 100%

if BFX decides to socialize losses how much of company profits , personal money of people involved in BFX will also be put down to minimize losses of customers?

these people do internal trading all the time , with insider knowledge, all exchanges do , we dont want haircut on your money but we want to know how much bitfinex company has put down of their own money and profits to minimize the losses of customers,and that doesn't mean shoving down BFX coins our throats,I mean actual money!

Do you think the scaling debate will get to the point where there price of bitcoin will go as low as below 500$? is it possible at this point in bitcoin? and how is it possible for businesses relying on bitcoin as payment to continue with such big decline?
