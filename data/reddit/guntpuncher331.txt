Apologies then, like I said I usually check at least once a day for all the hot topics but I honestly don't recall seeing it. Thanks though, glad that I got it cleared up.

No? That's why I'm asking for clarification. Is there something I'm missing out on?
AFAIK that's one of the sites he posted on and his account that was inactive since 09 is now posting. I'm just curious.

Mmm you're so right, a bit like when we reached $1000, dropped and then came back up again.
Fuck this ponzi system, I'm going to leave all my money in the bank from now on because it's the safest place in the world and [no one but me will have access and control to my money.](

Thanks, that's what I wanted to know and the perfect answer. I usually check in this subreddit every day but don't recall hearing about it. Couldn't they check for IP logins? I mean it'd be pretty huge if it was the same guy who posted..
Off-topic, thanks for the assholes that downvoted me when I just asked a question. Your contribution to helping newbies to Bitcoin is greatly valued. /s.

I got my dates confused in the excitement.

You're also forgetting there's not much going on in terms of user adoption as well. Bitcoin can work perfectly like any other e-commerce system, it's been proven but there needs to be more education on how easy it actually is to buy bitcoins, point out the benefits for both people using them as merchant systems and for customers paying with them (Hint hint, pass on the cc processing fees onto the customer, no one is going to bother going through an extra process of buying coins if there's no extra benefit or unless Bitcoin dominates a specific market)

Or we could spend more time educating people on Bitcoin and washing away the stereotype that only someone who has something to hide would use Bitcoin.
For example, credit card breaches would no longer exists if only Bitcoin was used. They can't do much with just an address and in all honesty it would be the merchants job to ensure coins aren't kept in a hot wallet (IE, use Bitpay to withdraw at the end of each day)

Yeah fuck this ponzi system! Fuck everyone who was an early adopter and fuck Satoshi who planned this right from the start so when it becomes mainstream he can sell all his premined coins! 
Fuck the system, it's not like there's a public ledger where we can keep track of all newly generated coins and transactions nor is there any sort of website where we can review the Bitcoin code to see what it does! All a big scam!

Thought they were American only, thanks. I'll look into it for him.

I'm new to Bitcoin but I think we could skip the automatically cleared feature. Either the person has their 2FA device or they don't.

If someone knows a good way to comply with all UK law &amp; to accept Bitcoin payments I'll be happy to pass it on to management. I always pay with cash when I eat their but I do know a lot of people who have walked out because they didn't accept card.
