False, the relationship between velocity and price is positive not negative.

Bitfluence essentially provides a way for people to send you BTC by knowing your twitter handle. Looking to integrate other services (wallets, social networks) in the future to provide a secure, single point of contact.

This is an extremely important topic, and could have resulted in a Mt. Gox type situation being averted. In a way it could prevent fractional-reserve banking. I'm working on a simple twitter identity system for bitcoin that could serve as the extra signature for transactions through a wallet provider such as coinbase or blockchain.

"decentralized identity" sounds nice but in practice is not functionally useful. If you are relying upon centralized identity to add any sort of credibility to this concept you should drop the decentralized buzzterm from your vocab.

That's not true, but I'm too tired to explain why.

The twitter account is back up
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:05:41
What happens if someone looses they 3rd party keys? Can the wallet create new ones?
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:46:32
it would be really cool!

still confused. that post would have made more sense if it was never written.

Since our authorization token from twitter expires after a certain amount of time, you have to send BTC Via bitfluence for now :)

thanks we appreciate that. would love to integrate other networks, however need to hash out how that impacts the choice of usernames

bitcoin donations are global in scope, secure, and fast. who wouldn't want to accept it?

that's why we built it! submitted today.

you are correct in stating the majority of the "money supply" is created by banks via the fractional reserve process (making loans). However, the physical dollar bills in circulation are all Fed liabilities. The "magic money" (deposits not actually backed by physical bills just the bank IOU) is not actually a liability of the federal reserve. But that's only because that money doesn't actually exist.

having only a few counterparties that interact with the market can produce more stable results. They can then form market facing products like coinbase to facilitate retail trading.

My guess is software built on top of the protocol will end up reducing the friction inherent in the system. Simplifying the process of sending and recieving. Kind of like SMTP, and less like requesting a webpage via HTTP.

how could somone else looking at that transaction know that it's a colored coin transaction?

I read the whole thing. The underlying vibe from the critics seems to be: "bitcoin doesn't perfectly fit into one of these three categories: asset, commodity, or currency. Therefore we're not sure how to value/analyze it." I work in finance and am confronted with the same kind of pushback. I think if people view bitcoin more as a payment network (coins representing slots in global ledgers) than an actual currency, it could do a lot for adoption rates. Seems slightly less ideological and/or threatening and is more in line with what the technology *actually is*.

A high volume of new adopters is actually a good thing. Consider this: since the supply of bitcoin is actually a fixed number, the value of any one BTC is purely a function of the velocity of transactions flowing through the network over a given time interval. As transactions increase, the number of people bidding on a single bitcoin increases. This increases the price of a bitcoin (holding supply constant), and as price increases the *percentage* change in the value of a coin decreases. For example, the percentage change from $1/per BTC to $2/per BTC is actually 100%. Lets say the value of a bitcoin increases to $10,000 due to demand from transactions, the percentage change caused by a $500 swing in it's value is only 5%. This is a good thing for all parties involved, except of course for traders. :-)

Dude you guys need a simpler use case explanation. Love the concept, however.

Bitcoin is going to be difficult for economists to model (I studied economics). I think bitcoin fits the traditional definition of money as a transfer and store of wealth. Traditional money is treated as an asset &amp; currency as the purpose of quantitative easing is to devalue the "asset" aspect of money. Over time economists realized that hoarding does not lend itself to growth and makes for very bad recessions. If bitcoin prices are very fluid, however, then bitcoin could bounce back easier from recessions. If prices are sticky (like Keynes said) then bitcoin suffers from the same problem traditional money does, except it's infinitely divisible which means money transfers can take place on a very small level in a practical sense. which could have big implications for modeling. long story short, bitcoin is both an asset and a currency, which works to it's advantage in the long term.

All currency in the hands of the public is considered a liability on the Fed's balance sheet.

social sharing is pretty tightly integrated with twitter at the moment. The share button pulls up a new tweet :)

We are working on this. Launch this week. Bitfluence.com. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:24:53
false. bitcoin has a dual purpose, store of value and transfer of wealth. Therefore it can't be defined solely as a currency, it's also an asset. It's more accurately described as "money" not currency. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:07:56
the more complex the bitcoin ecosystem becomes and the more financial instruments that depend upon bitcoin, the more difficult it will be to say bitcoin is "better" than another money system. fractional reserve banking can really manipulate the money supply in a seemingly "fixed" money system. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:32:57
I have always liked the colored coins concept because the real strength of bitcoin is the network aspect, not the currency aspect. it's a crappy currency, but it's an awesome network to transfer value.

Hey burrito_muncha - working toward adding a "find your friends" feature that integrates with twitter. Right now it's just search. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:02:53
my thoughts exactly. if you are tech savvy and have a twitter, this could be a pretty easy intro to bitcoin.
