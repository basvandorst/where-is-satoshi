If people can get into your wallet, it will be gone by then. Take what you can get. You should be willing to take 20k this money is toast.

Really? Everyone should be pulling there money out at once?... Find the person who didn't pay attention to 9th grade social studies.

Why did he not do time for bit instant? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:14:51
I wish was more posts like this, actual content not just circle jerk and memes.

You're a better man than me, did you get tipped? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:56:09
That doesn't explain how the network is handling that many more tps
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:57:12
Why? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:06:42
"you can't spend it on anything"... Purse has been around for a while... Regrettably

There zero chance I'm downloading multiple programs and changing code for lightning network to work. For this to be a thing everyone needs access easily. If not and we are still stuck with high fees low times then it's on the core team to put their shit together. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:46
Lightning network won't be a thing with constant 4000btc attacks and shady 3rd parties.

Look up March 25th 1929. Coinbase doesn't have the capital to give everyone their fist.

You seriously have had any right to talk about any television show revoked for the rest of your life. Or until you stop saying retarded shit

The first line in that article is a straight lie. The only thing decentralized is the validators. Ripple is centralized everyone knows that. Incredibly disengenous article.
You didn't even read the article. They froze the funds because he tried doing something he wasnt supposed to do.
Edit: if only btc could freeze the mtgox thing.

Yea well some may say a coin limited to 430k transactions and 40$ a transaction fee is a shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:00
Exchanges aren't implementing being able to trade off of cold storage. No matter what at some point your money will be in the hands of a 3rd party. At which point its vulnerable.

Early conspiracy. What if Roger ver is trying to create a backdoor to bitcoin wallets so he can undermine the value and bring people to bcash.

How is this not top of Yo, bitcoin community get your head out of your ass and stop memeing, there is serious shit going on.
Edit: Now this gained traction, I'm serious. For the past month there has been nothing but low quality memes, turning this subreddit to a circlejerk (I have made one of these shitty posts). But at a certain point we need to take this community seriously. We have the potential to connect to many people. If someone is interested in bitcoin and they stop here, only to see 1000 posts about the price on coinbase, when WE ALL FUCKING HAVE THE INTERNET, they will just see bitcoin as a meme. I think the moderators of this subreddit need to take some control. I think all posts that are a coinbase or some other ticker screenshot, should be auto deleted. There are occasions where memes are okay, but it's time we return to building this community. Saying hodl every two seconds is idiotic. Let's all grow up please.
Edit: edit: there is a post on front page with 1000 up votes all it is, is "14k!" with nothing of substance. Please moderators, stop letting this sub degenerate. This isn't We want to have fun, but posts with any sort of meaningful conversation are being blown away by this plethora of low content bullshit.
Edit: edit: edit: because I'm high and have a podium. Why not be like other top subreddits. When a post hits a moderator should have a pre-made comment sent to the top, with an introduction to and bitcoin in general. An faq of how to get involved and buy bitcoin. This can all be done fairly easily as I've seen it done on many subs. There are 10+ mods on this subreddit, for a community based on a currency that could reach the trillions, yet for the past month the filth on this subreddit has grown equally with the price of bitcoin. We need the great purge and revamp of 2018.
Edit:edit:edit:realedit: the you was supposed to be yo.
There's part of me that thinks bitcoin could actually be powered by memes. In which case, bring on those 20k memes.

Why have I spent all my bitcoin. I wouldn't have needed to work my first year out of school.

BME pain Olympics 2? Just for bitcoin. This is nonsense. You didn't need to do that

Atleast you didn't pay a quarter of a btc for a big plushed appa for your ex back in 2013
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:28:55
It's not if you look at local bitcoin...

Seals with clubs operates in a gray area. Regular online gambling legal in canada, I don't see why bitcoin gambling wouldnt be.

You have to look at btc/usd not btc/cny but what I realized is you can't deposit usd anymore.

Why is the asking price on bter for a bitcoin currently $80 less then the price of a bitcoin? Or does the site work differently then buying or selling on something like coinbase? Could I buy a btc from bter for $210 then sell from coinbase for $290? 
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:06:53
Shit all I saw was money signs ... Calculated 3800 profit a day with a withdrawal limit of 50 btc . There is still probably time right?

All I want to do is buy then sell immediately after depositing to coinbase. Is that not possible? Is bter going to have a mt gox situation in the next few days?
