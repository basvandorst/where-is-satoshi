I operate business both in the USA and Canada, I can assure you that we get per-transaction fees on top of monthly service fee AND yearly maintenance fee for the terminals. That's why we encourage customers to switch to Btc or use actual cash.
Debit card also have fees, by the way.

No, I sold for over $200,000 usd worth of in-game currency from various games, and I did not put it on my tax report. I was allowed to just fix my tax report and pay late fees. I feel lucky it did not get worst.

Having been hit by the IRS for over $200,000 worth of gold from various games, yes, it is fucking taxable man.

It's also actually easy to get into this business, there is not much competition, but plenty of scammer so you must always look after yourself. 
You just have to find a game that have demands, a supplier (usually they are currency farmer based in china or russia, and they bots game with hundreds of pc) You buy cheap from them and resell for ~35% to 40% higher to customers.
I won't tell you what games i'm on for obvious reason, but there's so many games out there, there's always going to be customers.
