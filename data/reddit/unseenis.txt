$60 in fees? Am I seeing that correctly?

They halted trading to wait for price to rise. (my speculation) 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:28:53
If you don't own/hold your secret keys, BTC is not yours... Better to get them out of coinbase and into something that you can control 
@_date: 2016-08-20 05:08:05
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:31:34
or use circle 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:12:11
I'm buying, in small increments. BTC will go up/down as it always has. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 16:48:24
Trezor and make a backup key
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:03:44
Welcome 1%
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:03:51
Try to get that from bitfinex... My condolences to those who lost BTC 
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:30:11
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:59:25
Circle - at first you can buy up to $300/weekly then you can request for limit increase. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:15:25
Just use shapeshift.io you might even make some back in exchanges to altcoin
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:30:09
Purchase on  circle, transfer to mycelium then do whatever you want. Extra step you can take is to use shapeshift.io 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:55:48
Good news for us, buy while price tanks, once they back online, BTC should jump in price 
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:14:59
You can buy up to 3k on circle per week
@_date: 2016-08-01 05:29:31
Bitwage is just a middle man in converting ach to BTC, taxes has nothing to do with it, your employer gives you pay stub and w2 at the end of the year, just like with any other ach deposits 
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:53:21
Did you use debit card? Money should be back into your bank account in few days 
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:42:13
They don't have that option
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:24:43

If you don't own "private keys" for your coins then stay far, far away from sites/wallets/services of that type. 
I buy my coins from circle/coinbase and then transfer them out to cold storage, where I and only I have private keys for my coins. TREZOR is highly recommended in this sub.

i think coinbase processes cc transaction as cash advances so you're kind of SOL on fees.

OP, just tell them that you transfered to cold wallet for offline storage. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:26
You can use ETH or LTC for smaller transaction, BTC for larger amounts. Easy peasy
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:03:47
Same can be said exchanging BCH for BTC... Win and win
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:51:45
What exchange you guys using for bch to BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:35:14
I remembered few months back lots of newbs did same thing with ETH, sold BTC for ETH... ROFL
Shapeshift BCH to BTC is the only viable option at the moment...
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:06:39
Does it count dumping BCH at it's highest and getting BTC?!!! Patience pays off.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:08
Where you going? HODL

And to those who exchange BCH for BTC at .5 /coin
@_date: 2016-09-04 20:25:32
you need to wait few days before you can buy, they verify manually and monday being holiday, kind of puts you in tough spot.
try this  if you need btc asap
@_date: 2016-09-04 20:29:37
 if you're in states

@_date: 2016-09-04 21:00:42
As an alternative method to OP's question, since what op was asking doesn't exist
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:12:21
Nothing large, few coins were bought thru the month.
Never responded, acct still open but I might close it just cause. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 20:12:19
1. you need to be verified
2. when you buy BTC thru circle, send them to another wallet before transferring to betting site, if you dont, then circle will close your account
3. if circle asks where money was send from your wallet, just tell them it was deposited into your "cold storage"
good luck...

If you don't control private keys then you don't "own" your crypto, just remember that next time you setup your wallet. Best practice is to get hardware wallet, save your recovery seed upon initial setup and then problems like these won't arise

I doubt that BTC is going to be world currency but I've been wrong before. 
Better stash it before it's doomed. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 03:25:26
Then back to BTC, might actually make few bucks due to exchange rate
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:59:13
They should be setup with BTC for donations, I hear Europe is way ahead of USA in BTC 
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:55:27
Ohh look, another politician that accepts donations... Lol 
@_date: 2016-07-31 03:05:55
I got scammed yesterday for $75 from bitmarket, scammer deleted his user name and all the messages after I sent him BTC, worst thing is when I tried to post [scammer] alert, my post got flagged. Not sure what's up w/reddit

 Circle has a limit for purchasing coins due to regulations. You only able to spend 3k every 7 days. I've never had any issues w/them so far. Now coinbase is another story 
@_date: 2016-07-31 04:34:22
So you bought in at the highest of the market... I would just hold and buy in small increments on falling price, time is the secret in BTC market.
