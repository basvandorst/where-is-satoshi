They have "reduced" since ASIC's became more powerful and efficient..doesn't mean less hashing..it was in the PENTA hash 2 years ago and now it has hit 4-6 exahash..I've mined for years and obviously follow my mining intimately.

You can pay taxes in some us states with bitcoin no reason to pay anything if you never need to convert back to fiat.also bitcoin value increases,dxy has lost it value and is near hyperinflation levels..look what happened to Germany after the war or worse yet Zimbabwe..if there is an alternative safe form of currency that is adopted (gold,assets) or in this case bitcoin there will be no need to go back to fiat..your also not taking into consideration 7nm chips and the lightning network. Bitcoin miners wont need to be "tipped" until the year ~2147..so your either very green in regards to bitcoin or your anti bitcoin and posting to discourage others in participating in the worlds largest socio economic experiment of all time.. your the same person who who have said in 1980s a glass faced computer phone or internet would be impossible..i have seen cable tv go from a box with an A-B CLICKER no remotes to Netflix/vudu being a button that comes internet ready on tv remotes today.. this is only a decade new disruptive technology...look at what the internet was like only 10years old vs nowadays..look at phones 10years ago vs now..now imagine bitcoin 10YEARS FROM NOW.....open your mind..its going to happen whether you want it to or not..layering tech will have fees be very low...you must not realize how high fees are for western union.also using coinbase pro there is no fee for transferring bitcoin to fiat so im assuming your using some junk like robinhood version app.

Nodes and miners are doing this as a labor of love to get away from relying on fiat.

Wrong 7nm chips in A.S.I.C.S. and possibly 100 terahash per miner will be triple+ what we use now 27terahash per miner..dec 2020 I would like to continue this debate.
As for remittances you will see with 7nm chips and lightening network it will be what dial up internet was to fiber optics.
My mining pool when i started was barely 1 penta hash..it is now 5 exahash and i have a quarter million miners in my slushpool..think why would just my pool have that many committed miners if there was no possibility for profit and adoption..your smarter than than all of us, millions or miners are all dumb and you have the answers because the network on its maiden 1st time of mass volume was a bit slow and fees increased if you wanted to send or receive quick.if you have your own nodes it makes a difference as well..there are alot of variable your not taking into account young man.

Remittances will spike bitcoin within 4years max. Go write a dm to the world famous SEALERS on stocktwits and see who replies.
Here is why if btc/bch taking of remittances is all btc needs to be 6figures..Philippines, Venezuela, Zimbabwe all examples.
Here is excerpt from an article that will help you understand why remittances not transactions are more important in btc short term growth:
Report: Use of Cryptocurrencies for Remittance Is Growing in Popularity
A new report by a blockchain-focused research company asserts that there has been a spike in people using cryptocurrencies to send remittances. This growth is in part due to the high costs incurred when using more traditional methods such as Paypal. 
The value of remittances being sent overseas from the U.S. is greater than ever. World Bank Data states that over $148 billion was sent abroad from the U.S. in 2017. With an increasingly interconnected world seeing more people than ever moving abroad to work – and send money back home – migrants are looking for easier ways to cut costs and avoid getting ripped off by banks and other middlemen. One effective way of doing so is of course with cryptocurrency. Blockchain research company Clovr has said in its latest report that this new method has become more popular than ever.
The report, named Sending Money Back Home, reveals that of to the 707 people surveyed, 15.8 percent use cryptocurrency to send cash home. This makes it one of the more popular methods, ranking in fourth place after using an online service, money transfer service, or traditional wire transfer. ￼
According to the report, the use of cryptocurrencies is in part due to the high costs associated with using traditional methods of sending money abroad such as Western Union or Moneygram. When money is sent to countries within Africa with these methods, “super-taxes” are often occurred – especially when sending money within the continent. A remittance going from South Africa to Malawi could see fees upwards of 20 percent, for example. Cryptocurrency can minimize such costs. The report notes:
If some of the largest companies in the world, like Microsoft and Starbucks, are comfortable accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, this should instil confidence in using these new forms of payment for sending remittances
– Clovr
There is no doubt that using cryptocurrency to send money abroad can save money, as the report demonstrates by looking at the cost of sending $500 abroad. Banks on average would charge 10.41 percent for such a transaction while a post office could set someone back $34. Using bitcoin core (BTC) or bitcoin cash (BCH) to get money overseas could actually see the sender make money. The report states: “By avoiding the high transaction fees and conversion rates typically associated with transferring funds abroad, you can take a few extra steps (including converting the government-issued currency into cryptocurrency and then back again), potentially getting significant savings.”

Look up joe rogans podcast how he would pay 10k a month to play the game quake..your trying so hard to use my analogy to disprove BTC being a disruptive tech that WILL be worth more in future..your assuming high fees of 2017 ended BTC? You havent seen anything yet. Laying L.N. or another layering tech will make btc cheaper than other remittances and even if fee was equal btc is a better option than fiat..what would you rather have held as an income producing asset from 2009 to 2017.. would you have rather had $100 of DXY fiat or have bought $100 in btc in 2009? Your not seeing the forest through the trees. When your in your 40s-50s you will remember how foolish you were.

What difference does it make if its moving its moving from a wallet or peer to peer. Fiat moved from account to accounts and peer to peer..as long as its moving and fungible it works..bitcoin has a decade of PRIME MOVER advantage over all other alt coins, it has a cult like user base and is growing..volatility is fantastic for day,swing and long investors..CBOE has futures (XBT).
May 2020 halving coming and s15 antminer is next step to more efficient mining. Im still using s9s to mine and its profitable at .
.09cents kwh. Dec 2020- mid 2021 we will see parabolic growth..look how fast we went from $3500-$9000 this year..that's nothing
 Wait until people stop using remittances like money gram,western union etc, and use bitcoin for out of country remittance transfers to save on the huge fees western union and others charge.
Bitcoin will see $20k again easily by dec2020
