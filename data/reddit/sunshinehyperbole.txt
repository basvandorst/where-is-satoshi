Hi.

The actual reason we’re suddenly talking about him is because someone was poor-shaming him yesterday because he didn’t actually become a bitcoin millionaire himself. He responded on twitter explaining it was due to him needing to actually survive the last few years. The Bitcoin community wasn’t impressed with the dude who pointed out Andreas’ lack of wealth. But it may have ended up working out in Andreas’ favour with an outpouring of gratitude towards him.

In Australia I can sell it on an exchange and withdraw the cash. Hits my bank within 1 business day. 
You could go to one of those websites where people in local areas meet up and trade cash for bitcoin.

Yeah I’m up for it! Cheers.

If anything, when you look at the origins of the hodling meme, it was in direct _opposition_ to the ponzi like behaviour of folks convinced they could trade bitcoin and get rich. 
A hodler says “this has long term value, so I’m saving them and have no plans to sell”
A Ponzi scheme relies on the notion that someone will come along and pay more for your bags soon. 
Trading = ponzi
Hodling = recognising how the block subsidy halvings work over time and realising we’re creating a new form of money.

The exec didn’t say that. He said "There's a thesis that at some stage in 5, 10, 15, 20 years - who knows - accounts will disappear, and be replaced."
So he’s just saying that some other people think this and they, the banks, need to keep an eye on things. 
Business Insider strikes again.

I went through all the shitcoins. Have owned most of the ones you’ve heard of. Researched till the cows came home. 
I now only own BTC.

First, find out what the total supply is of ETH. Then look at what the total supply is of BTC
