How do you know this?

lol, this is funny so I wrote a comment about it.

He said it uses google under the hood.

Ok, but what is your actual point? To defend the meaning of the word gambling?

The funniest thing about your reply is it implies you do know what you're talking about, and I am not seeing any text that explains anything further.

I think this is a great point as it talks to the discipline bitcoin fans and stakeholders will need going forward. The US Dollar, and all involved currencies and economies, are essentially helping us to prop up the liabilities of working towards a bitcoin world. It's paying for it. If we are using our bitcoins to pay for things, we are essentially losing out on potential value of the thing we are all hoping makes it to the front.  I envision a worm eating it's tail while it regenerates to become full length. If using the bitcoin is for marketing and awareness, great, understandable, but realize the final cost to us as individuals.

I doubt he's thinking of it like that. Take a chill pill.

Pretty decent comment that validates the strength of the previous comment

Does CashApp allow you to withdraw to your wallet right away after you buy or is there a hold?

Ok, so I tried this with $100 on Coinbase with my linked account and the funds went in completely without any holds. It says I have $100 in cash. I go to Coinbase pro and when at the deposit window "coinbase account", it says I have $100 but it won't let me deposit. It says I have $100 total balance and $100 funds on hold. Maybe this is because I have never used coinbase pro before?

Woah, he's not your comrade, friend.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:27:04
I've been reading this post for a while now and I'm not sure he actually has one.

Keep in mind with Coinbase Pro you have to wait about a week for your deposit to show up before you can purchase any Bitcoin.

OP has a dollar of bitcoin...let's not act surprised here.
