XP Embedded, you'll find it *everywhere* - not just ATMs but cash registers/POS, set top boxes, office phones, kiosks, those large screens at airports and shopping centers, video poker, arcade games, etc.
It is still supported, unlike desktop XP - and there is a good reason why it is so popular, it is cheap, only requires 32MB of ROM, and you can write .NET / Windows apps for it so you don't need specialized development skill as you would with other realtime operating systems.
Using standard XP or standard desktop Windows for a bitcoin ATM would be a bad choice, but using XPe would make sense.

There are two ways .onion's can live on beyond CAB's deprecation of local names in SAN certificates:
1. .onion becomes a gTLD. This means a proper, recognized domain in the same way .com and .net, etc. are. This idea didn't proceed because ICANN want a few hundred thousand dollars and it couldn't find a sponsor. You can see how quickly it started and died in the [Tor Project issue tracker here](
2. The CAB guidelines are amended to create a special case for .onion addresses. There is a proposal that is in the draft stages right now. I'd link to it, but it isn't public yet - but if you would like a copy I could send it to you. The proposal amends sections 9.2.2 and 11.7.1 of CAB's *Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certificates* as well as adding an Appendix F titled "Issuance of Certificates for .onion Domain Names". There is very solid support for the proposal with just some tweaks to sort out before it goes to a ballot. The chances of some form of this proposal passing between now and next November 1 are very high - nobody disagrees in principal with allowing .onion domain names to be recognized. Without this level of assurance we wouldn't have DigiCert signing certificates and we wouldn't have Facebook and Blockchain setting them up. In short - we aren't idiots, we know about the deprecation date and are actively involved in the proposal to exempt onion.
The Tor Project has *never* been opposed to this or 'not bothered'.


I question just who is going to sign that certificate, but in any case I don't disagree that checking the address is also important. Just as checking that you're on `paypal.com` and on an SSL connection is also important before you login. It is the reason why we generated a new and more memorable onion address for Blockchain. 
The good thing about the verification is that if you decide to phish blockchain with your own generated onion we'd then know who you are.
*edit* One thing that I forgot to mention - there is a lot of discussion at the moment about changing the length of onion addresses if it is going to be used for authentication. SHA1 is being phased out of use in SSL because it is weak, meanwhile onion addresses not only use SHA1, but they crop the result and only use the first 80 bits. I got to 10 characters matched of 16 in an onion address with an hour of code and some API calls. We can keep the more readable shorter names and wrap HTTPS over them, or drop HTTPS and adopt longer names more suitable for authentication. The later case means addresses that are even less memorable, and it becomes the equivalent of arguing that CA's aren't required because you can just get users to remember and then check the fingerprint of every SSL certificate.

"secret bidding" is different to revealing the final price. secret bidding is the auction mechanism where during the auction period bids are not disclosed to other bidders.

To add, there should be a recognized public mistrust of the current most popular markets which is discounting the current bitcoin price and suppressing real demand.
US government selling bitcoin as an asset was a big deal.
As soon as the USD put in a sell order of US-backed bitcoin latent institutional demand emerged. It wasn't a case of supply creating demand, but a case of US-backed supply creating institutional demand.
Auction shows how much demand there is in $1M+ range. Today if you want to buy anywhere from $1-200M of btc you have nowhere to go other than to break it up yourself across exchanges. Having the market in the US or UK is important, nobody is going to wire $20M to an offshore company operating somewhere in East Europe where the owners aren't even known.
In theory, when the Silk Road coins were seized the price of btc should have surged rather than plunged, because it meant the coins went from being backed by an anonymous criminal enterprise to the US government.
This all proves just how unsophisticated the bitcoin market has been to date. What bitcoin really needs is not just better markets, but institutions based in trusted nations serving the role of investment banks where large off-market block trades can be matched and settled, and a lot of the other infrastructure that is in-place in other real world markets that make them function efficiently.

Roger's post makes no mention of not asking the CAB forum for an exception. He *specifically says* he hasn't made his mind up about it.  You aren't paraphrasing his post, you're reinterpreting it. The conversation has moved on from that post and there *has* been a proposal written to get an exemption for onions. One thing I pointed out is that a signed certificate doesn't mean payment is required - blockchain paid nothing for their onion certificate, it was added in the SAN field. With CAB formalizing onions you'll likely see free providers of certificates.
Re: Adam Langley, that was his suggestion that wasn't taken up. The forum has since moved on from that *and is* working on a proposal without a "formal" request from the Tor project.
Re: Facebook you're only backing up what I said - they took up an onion because they could get a certificate signed.
Re: the blog post - I respectfully disagree with the poster. His entire objection is based on CA/B deprecating all local names in SAN certificates, with the proposal to carve out an exception, his argument no longer applies. 
My argument is pretty simple and not difficult to understand, and I laid it out 2 comments ago: 80 bits of SHA1 is not strong enough to cryptographically to authenticate a service. One of two things needs to happen: you either add HTTPS to it and CAB recognize .onion addresses, or Tor change the address format for hidden services. 
If they adopt a longer hostname then they are no longer memorable, which sets off another set of issues. The validation and failure modes for HTTPS are already built into all browsers, seems a more logical solution.

It was clear from your statement that if you looked at it objectively they didn't actually tell you anything substantial, but rather had sold you on false confidence. You interpreted this as 'news' because it made you feel better, but it was far from the truth. 
There is no possible good news when the first audit ever conducted shows the hot wallet with 2,000 coins, no cold wallet and the database with 750,000 coins. That isn't just bad news, it is sheer negligence - to the point where it is one of the largest heists or cons in human history.
I don't think there should be a witch hunt now, since a lot of people *wanted* to believe and didn't want (what was clear and obvious to most neutrals) the bad news to be true. I'm not sure how much you can blame people for hoping things would be ok.
It would be very different in the case of somebody who sought to actively mislead the public and *knew* there were problems but chose to cover for MtGox. The only way to find out about those is if people of influence or those who made positive public statements fully disclosed their holdings and/or any sales.

The news for individuals couldn't be more *awesome*:


"carried out an investment" means like buying a house. You bought Bitcoin long-term. "Not carrying out a business" should be obvious - ie. this is in your personal name.
You can't get better than this, having your earnings treated as capital gains is *exactly what you want*. Lots of wealthy people pay a lot of money to people in suits to structure their income so that it is treated as capital gains rather than as income. It is why CEO's take small salaries and stock options, and why money is always re-invested.
Not that capital gains are only assessed when *realized* - so when you sell the coin. The ATO then ask you what you bought them for and what you sold them for. Capital gains have a ton of other advantages as well that income taxes do not (deferred, offset rules, etc.)
With the fluctuating prices, you can offset losses on some trades against gains in others. There is all sorts of standard stuff here an accountant will take you through.


Profit making on bitcoin is if you are trading for the explicit purpose of earning income. Example: you act as a market maker (a guy on a street corner, or a localbitcoin vendor) then your net income is *personal* income subject to PAYG. 
If you are a localbitcoin vendor you shouldn't be trading under your real name in any case, you should setup a business (and setup a proper two-arm business like what most stock investment or trading firms do, where you have a trading co. an asset holding co. and/or another entity to take out carry/profits/etc.)


Just like when you buy a stock you don't pay GST (and the person purchasing it back doesn't take back or track the GST,its just a waste of paperwork)
These rulings legitimize bitcoin in *every* sector of the Australian economy. The news is not only great in that regard, but great in that this is the *minimum* way they could legitimize bitcoin while at the same time not screwing it up.
Speak to an accountant. They will all be getting this new ruling over the next month or two anyway and most will have heard of it by tax time next year. For personal investment you don't have much to do, either hold and do nothing or sell and report CGT (and legitimize that money arriving in your AU bank account with a lower tax rate than income tax).
Also note that all of this applies to "australian" bitcoin.

It doesn't matter how they find them, they would have been found out and prosecuted in any case. Transferring funds for Silk Road just expedited what would normally take the government 12 months to uncover through audits to a short 4 month process.
Mt Gox weren't even a registered MSB federally, which even BitInstant were. From the moment they opened their first account it was a countdown to seizure + charges. Whoever gave them the advice that they only needed a partnership was very wrong.
It also makes the rumor of there being an outstanding US fed indictment out against Mt Gox all the more believable.

You really have to stop speaking on behalf of people you don't know. You did it above with the Tor Project, then again with CA/B and now with Facebook.
Facebook were looking to generate 3 hostnames that began with facebook. They stumbled on the name they got completely accidentally, they didn't seek it out. 
The only reason they felt comfortable launching the onion site is because they could get a cert for it. They did it for the reason that 80-bits of SHA1 is simple not a secure authentication mechanism. Not difficult to understand.
Nobody is going to sign your certificate with blockchain*.onion on it. They won't sign it in the same way you can't just register PayPal Ltd in some other country and get paypal.com with a cyrillic a signed. There have been a total of two onion certificates signed and there is a single CA signing them, so you aren't exactly going to sneak in under the radar. Between now and when the CA/B guidelines are updated there will likely be no more than a dozen certificates signed, and all of them will be alt services.

After that story I spent some time chasing down the figure and what was true or not. The author of the Verge piece said she clarified with MtGox and they said the $25 million included their FinCen security deposits paid with each state (they refer to the figure as one that has been paid, rather than one that *could* be paid). I emailed a few lawyers, people I know at other startups, etc. and nobody could verify any MtGox compliance. I also emailed MtGox a few times, and at first it looked like they were going to co-operate but then they sent this:
I was close to writing a story stating that MtGox were not in compliance and were likely going to have their funds seized or be indicted in the USA when they did have their funds seized.

It is more than that, since you are comparing with a *full* Bitcoin price. The market is saying there is an 18.5% chance that Mt Gox will remain solvent **and** be able to restore *every* full Bitcoin and cash balance. 
There is a lot of debate on wether Mt Gox will survive or not, but I don't think anybody believes they will be able to restore every single bitcoin and cash balance. 
My odds on their survival are a lot lower than that. I think they were leaking coins for months but only noticed recently when their wallets were empty, and that is when they stopped withdrawals. 
Add that to the seizures, staff layoffs, address changes, Japanese bankruptcy not favoring foreign debt holders (especially those in a virtual currency), their previous lies ("Mt Gox has spent over $50 million to become compliant with FinCen in the USA") and seeming inability to manage a business professionally and you see why 18.5% if being a bit generous.

what a person is willing to pay or has paid is the exact definition of market value. it doesn't matter if he calculated the price or guessed it, he handed over USD for bitcoin. 
further the details of the auction will fill in a lot of information about off-market demand, "institutional" valuations, the potential liquidity available and lead to answers to questions such as what the unmet demand is of current markets, how much btc is discounted because of distrust of current markets, etc. etc.
The current markets are extremely unsophisticated and don't serve as a full guide for the "real" or potential state of bitcoin. the golden rule is always that *more information* is always good, which is why there are a lot of people watching this and waiting and not commenting on it openly because they want to analyse and keep their information to themselves (this is how markets work!)

We're hoping to have a solution between now and the SAN internal name cutoff date. There are a number of proposals already and somewhat of a consensus to finding a way to allowing .onion's as a common name or recognizing them in SAN fields. 


That isn't true. The Tor Project didn't want to pay ICANN the extortionate fee to register the TLD officially. 


Encrypts, yes - but getting SSL certificates signed by a CA is about *authentication*, not encryption. If it was only about encryption then everybody would just use self-signed certificates. 
The only authentication Tor hidden services provide is the onion address itself, and we know users aren't very good at checking it while HTTPS leaves it to the browser to check and fails prominently in the event of a failure in certificate verification. 


Please don't believe this, anybody. We just watched a week full of threads of people having their coins stolen precisely because they didn't check the SSL certificate.

Because you aren't buying a Bitcoin, you are buying an entry in MtGox's database which will likely convert to a debt note in a bankruptcy. 
The market price at the moment is suggesting that there is a 70%+ chance of MtGox not being able to meet *any* obligation. 
I think there is a point where the price becomes and interesting bet - what complicates it is Gox being in Japan and the state of other, perhaps secured, debt holders in the company taking precedence. 
I think there is no question that they are going down, I think we'll find out in post-mortem that they were horribly managed and never had any proper accounting or auditing.

Just to make it clear - I don't work for blockchain, i'm a freelance infosec consultant and work with different companies.
They've never had an EV cert because it was only recently that they setup a real office with an address that can be verified. They couldn't get it on this certificate since you can't EV a SAN certificate with the onion on it. Hopefully that will change with the proposal going to the CAB forum to formally recognize .onion hostnames.
As soon as we're able to get an EV we likely will - a lot of browsers are moving to displaying EV-only information, especially on mobile, which is a good move.

At the time of the original Verge article it was simple to lookup FinCen docs and see that Mt Gox wasn't registered or licensed.

For most people admitting you are Satoshi Nakamoto would have negative tax and legal implications, but in Wright's case it has positive implications.
The Australian government has asked him to prove where his $150M+ of Bitcoin that was invested in his firms originated. His method of confirming this with the tax authorities was to claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
If he *is not* Satoshi Nakamoto then it has *negative* consequences for him - as it means he has made a false claim to the Australian Government for tax concessions and sales tax rebates.
There is thus not only no legal negative legal implication for posting a proof, but he actually has a positive motivation to cryptographically prove that he is Nakamoto.

1. the statement refers to trustee in the singular, which means the trustee is a citizen of seychelles and a registered agent (by law) - why would that person, who is authorized to only speak to and act on behalf of Craig Wright  give this message to someone else who then just publishes it on the web? the whole point of the seychelles trust is confidentiality, the trustee isn't talking to this guy about shit.
1. saying "Tampering or manipulating with trust assets by anyone (including the beneficiary) might have material legal and tax implications" is just nonsense - the beneficiary is the person who can do what they want with the asset. The purpose of the trustee is to grant them legal title so that if anyone comes asking for the asset you can *technically* say the beneficiary doesn't own it, but for all purposes they do own/control it 
1. the most important thing - and I don't know how nobody has noticed this yet - is if we assume the document establishing the tulip trust is legitimate it makes a pretty bad error - it never actually defines what the assets are. It says "I, David Kleiman, shall become the trustee for the transfer of satoshi I received from Craig Wright" ... then ... "I have received 1,110,000 bitcoin from Craig Wright" etc. Since we don't see this transaction on the blockchain (as Satoshi coins haven't moved) then this is an off-blockchain transfer, yet it hasn't defined what these coins are - you'd expect the trust document to say "1,110,000 bitcoin from addresses: &lt;list of addresses and balances&gt;" 
This is all clearly bullshit and was part of one of Wright's advance fee frauds (if you're wondering how it works - the trust document says Wright will get 1.1M bitcoin in 2020, he's using this agreement to scam money out of people on the basis that he'll be a billionaire in 5-6 years time) - the question is why is the guy in the story above publishing that message and attempting to cover up for Wright?

Based on how Andresen described what they went through inside the room i'd guess that the NDA was an embargo rather than an agreement to remain perpetually silent. 
This feels more like they are wriggling out of their responsibility to admit they made a mistake.

I don't think the $54 million refund was ever paid, but he was paid earlier $6M and ~$2M refunds - he became more brazen but the last figure was too much even for the ATO (it was a larger claim than what even Google or Atlassian make)
There is also the sales tax case where the ATO found against him and penalized his company, Hotwire, $1.7 million. The way this worked is Wright funded the company with $30 million worth of Bitcoin. The company then purchased software from another Wright entity for $29 million. The first company then made a sales tax refund claim for this purchase and sought ~$3 million as a refund. What Wright was effectively doing was creating $3 million in real-cash refund from the tax office by transferring imaginary Bitcoins between himself. I detail how this worked [in my blog post from yesterday](
That entity went from being founded to shutdown in months. The DeMorgan entity seemed to exist solely to make R&amp;D claims from the Australian government.
Wright's primary MO these past few years, prior to fleeing Australia, was using various entities to create real-dollar tax refunds out of non-existant Bitcoins. I'm surprised it worked for as long as it did. 
These cases do explain his motive for why he presented himself as Satoshi Nakamoto.

It is clear from the complaint that this isn't a case of parallel reconstruction, because the type of evidence doesn't fit. It is just good old fashion doxing and a subject who slipped up more than once. 
This case *didn't need* some sort of government superweapon that is inadmissible in court, the digital trail this guy left is online for everybody to see.

Then why would the USA go to so much trouble selling war bonds during WW2? It was the largest marketing campaign of all during the war: "Be a patriot, buy war bonds!", etc.
Instead they could have just printed 'army dollars' and built air craft carriers, ships etc. with that.

I think they would use something as a metaphor for bitcoin, like buckets of KFC used as currency and the price increasing (like Crack Baby Athletic Association, Margaritaville. etc.).

Judging from the responses in the comments it *can't be* $47, since a lot of people baulked at that price - infact it already *isn't* $47 - it has been dropped by 25% already.
My feeling is that it won't be widely purchased until it reaches $10-15, that might be where the market is.

No you couldn't. The bubble was in the actual *bulbs*, the thing that is planted, and it was an introduced rare commodity from the East. 
You can't have a bubble without scarcity and some form of constraint, be it artificial or real. Bitcoin has both - real in that there is a block limit and artificial in that the rise in price self-perpetuates hoarding by large holders (until it doesn't).
It also probably isn't a good sign that people don't know what the tulip bubble was about and the lessons from it.

You're referring to the innovators dilemma. The theory isn't that "most companies" don't evolve, it is that some large companies get complacent with their dominant position and are stuck with not innovating and then get eaten up. 
PayPal still have the benefit of time and more to gain from Bitcoin than to lose (PayPal would rather rely on the Bitcoin network than the cartel Visa/Mastercard network).

It wasn't having those other profiles that tripped him up, it was cross-contaminating *once* and he realized that he had done it 60 seconds later and attempted to revert but it was too late.
The key lesson is that staying anonymous is very, very difficult. In years of working online you only have to trip up once while the FBI only have to find that one thing.
