But did you buy into their Veganfitcoin ICO?

$5k invested a few months ago would be $85k now if you picked alt coins well. Doesn't take 50 years if you're willing to deal with high risk and volatility.

This holiday has been a weird one. I've been talking about Bitcoin for about 4 years now, but this is the first time I was never the one to bring it up. Multiple times I had peopke I've never talked to about Cryptocurrencies bring them up, some even had opinions on alts like Ethereum and Litecoin.
What is this bizarre reality we're living in?
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:22:34
Hell I don't care how much you make but I'll deliver a pizza anywhere for 1 BTC.

I got in after it was already too late at the end of 2013... Oh well.
It was exciting in '14, then really sucked in '15 &amp; '16, but '17 has been pretty alright.

So apparently it was appropriate for Bitcoin to hit $15k *then* take off in your gif.

Thanks again for your suggestions. 
As an update, I got a hold of a Submariner. Absolutely love it. I've got small wrists, so I never thought I'd be able to wear a nice watch, but it fits perfect when the GlideLock is adjusted just right.

But you can polish the gold and make a signal mirror to get rescued, that's way more valuable

A mutual friend of ours showed me your campaign earlier today, he said you were the one who turned him on to Bitcoin a while ago. 
This is a really cool idea. One thing I was wondering, would it be possible for you to make coins with slightly more heft to them? While having something disposable is nice, something that feels about like a poker chip would be nice to have for BTC worth $50-100 or more. 
Also, having a poker set with actual funded BTC wallets in the amount of the face value would be awesome.

The best response I've heard from guys is:
"The odds are bad, but the goods are worse"
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:30:31
That's been my strategy. Selling is too much trouble anyway. 
I have a small weekly automatic purchase setup through Coinbase, and I buy slightly bigger chunks during big dips. Then just spend it occasionally.
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:44:28
According to the BIP, that individual transaction still wouldn't be reversed, the protocol still works the same in that sense. 
How it's different is that a merchant sends you a "Payment Request" which your wallet could respond to with a Payment transaction that includes a "Refund To" address. That way, on the seller's end, they can confidently issue an automatic return if necessary. 
There's a few other benefits for the whole purchase process as well. You can read more here:

There needs to be a more cost effective solution to implementing SSL in order for this to happen. 
It's expensive and not every site can afford it. I would love to have the personal side-projects I work on all be SSL, but that would cost significantly more than I currently pay for hosting.
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:55:43
I understand that, and I agree we you.
Hyper-inflation heavily favors those who don't save money and rack up a ton of debt over those who save up. 
But those who are prudent enough to save will try to find something, maybe it's Bitcoin, which can be a store of value not tied to the power of the dollar.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:28:02
Because of anti money laundering laws, you have to "know your customer" and the biometric scanner is a good faith effort to ensure the person making the transaction is the same person that put in their Gov ID when they first created an account. 
It sucks that its required, and it would be A LOT easier to use without it, but that's where we're at. It's still the easiest way to get BTC for cash by far at the moment.
Bitpay had a Lamassau ATM in town for SXSW and it had no verification, which was great. Although, it was considered a "promotional" machine and wouldn't be able to operate normally like that. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:07:04

A lot of motion detecting software has the ability to add zones, so depending on the angle you can ignore movement behind the register while catching movement from customers.

BIP70 looks really interesting. 
I've been a bit cautious using Bitcoin online because of potential issues getting a refund, if that becomes necessary. It'd be great to know there's a build in way to facilitate easy refunds.

"[Bitcoin's] only difficulty is in meshing with antiquated global banking systems."
He covered the problems you mention in the article. That's not a problem with Bitcoin, its a problem with banks and their high transaction fees. What you describe is a huge reason why Bitcoin is compelling. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:57:33
It would probably have to be either a multisig escrow as a deposit or you pay the full cost of the DVD and specify a refund address that gets credited upon return.

How do you reverse a cash transaction?
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:35:33
People are familiar with using an ATM and its quite a bit faster and easier to get verified for purchasing Bitcoins. 
The qualifications for verification are much lower than most places online.

Paying off college for the price of a cheap burger sounds fantastic.
You'd presumably be making more, so in that scenario an expense that would've taken many years to pay off becomes totally trivial.

You should've tried to use this machine when the first set it up and they didn't have any instructions or labels.

There's plenty of exchanges built by a solid team. Bitstamp, Kraken, Coinbase, among others are more than likely here to stay for quite some time. 
There's could definitely be some unique benefits provide red by a smaller "amateur" exchange. You have to weigh the risk vs rewards of each situation. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:50:25
When Bitpay was at SXSW, I talked to them about this. Apparently, at this point, their fees and number of transactions are so low that they usually don't make enough of a profit per business to be able to fund referral fees. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:25:10
I'm friends with the owner of this machine and I've talked with him about it a bit. 
The reason why they use the biometric scanner, which actually scans your palm vein pattern, is because they can use it to identify you for AML, but there's no government database of vein scans you have to worry about.

I checked it out earlier today as soon as I saw this post, it's pretty cool. It wasn't hooked up yet but it's definitely here and it's a Robocoin.
Apparently the operator just found out he was getting one so quickly, that's why the news broke so suddenly.

That was the idea. It took around 30 minutes each way. 
Driving in rush hour took 25 minutes on a good day and 40 on a bad one. I don't have time to work out, so I could get an exercise in during time I would just be sitting there wasting time.

I never keep much on exchanges, no more than 0.5 BTC usually. 
But I had just transferred coins over to Bitstamp to get in on the falling price a couple hours before they had deposit problems.
First time I've deposited coins there in probably 6 months. Great timing &gt;.&lt;

Thanks for the recommendations!
So I'm well aware picking a Rolex, many peoples impression will be that I picked that without any thought, but I've looked into different options for a while. Patek Philippe is definitely a fine brand with a much longer history than Rolex, and there are many other great options. 
I prefer the more utilitarian look of Rolex's professional series watches. I don't need a dress watch, I'd never wear it. A stainless Submariner looks just as good in running shorts as it does in a suit and it can take a beating, which is all more appropriate for my lifestyle. I actually prefer the history of the brand as a bulletproof tool watch from the 50-80s more than the modern luxury appeal, but the newer models have great features I appreciate like an extremely durable ceramic bezel, the glidelock clasp and a 10 year service cycle.
Overall, it's a quality watch that holds its value well and it's the one I like best.

I put in a sell order for $7777.77 about a week ago. I'll get a Rolex for that price and it'll be my lucky watch.
I'm sure this rally will keep going, but I started buying in 2013 and it seemed like a fitting threshold to take a profit.
I like the irony of exchanging a digital store of value, which has so much potential as a universal currency but isn't accepted yet, with a physical store of value, which is already accepted as a currency but has limited utility. I'll also be able to hold onto it forever as a reminder for when the only thing you could buy for a Bitcoin was a nice watch.

At least in the US, I would definitely argue that the people reproducing the most are not the most "advanced" but any standard other than their frequency to procreate. 
Some people get educated, get a job, advance society or technology, and some people make lots of babies and collect a check. There's absolutely no favoritism towards "improvement" at all.
