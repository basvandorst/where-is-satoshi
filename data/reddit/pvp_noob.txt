I was about to respond to a comment that got deleted.  Good thing I quoted parts of it.


I haven't bought any bitcoin.  As an analytical geek I am very interested in it and the creation of a new market.


Last I checked the Nasdaq still hasn't recovered its high from 2000 in 13 years with one of the largest bull markets and bubbles prior to the recession in 08 and strong bull market in general the past couple years.
I see a ton of denial that the value can't collapse any further or that it will recover.  I guess I'm just old enough to have learned those lessons.  Everyone said BoA stock would recover when I sold it at $28.  It continued to fall to $6 and 5 years later is now trading at $12.  I took a small loss but that was much better than a big one.

If a currency is not accepeted then it's not a currency is the heart of what you are saying if I understand you correct.  
If so, then without the utility these have as much market value as trading cards imo.

How is a well publicized speculative bubble followed by an immediate crash good for the long run viability?  
Potential serious investors are going to be scarred away for years.
