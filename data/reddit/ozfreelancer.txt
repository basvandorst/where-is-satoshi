It most certainly was brought up at his trial, despite him not having been charged with it. It was brought up as evidence in the "continuing criminal enterprise" charge
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:53:56
Nope. It was literally used in the judge's sentencing remarks as reasons for the sentence. She used it as going t to proof that he was willing to use violence to further his "continuing criminal enterprise"
The jury was allowed to hear all of the messages and testimony about it. The fact that he was never charged with them doesn't mean that they weren't used A LOT in his trial. It is one of the many egregious miscarriages of justice during his trial
@_date: 2015-06-02 04:48:45
Nice to see the judge is at least recommending medium security instead of maximum as would be the norm for such a sentence
Can someone explain what the "supervised release" page means?
It starts with "Upon release from imprisonment..." but release doesn't seem to be a factor in the sentence.

*"What everyone seems to be ignoring, however, is that the Silk Road sold more than just drugs. It also sold forgeries, hacking tools, stolen Paypal accounts, and credit/debit card numbers.  "*
Lost a bit of credibility there. Paypal accounts, credit/debit card numbers were expressly forbidden and any attempts to sell them were quickly taken down.
From the Silk Road Sellers' Guide: "prohibited items include child pornography, stolen credit cards and goods, assassinations, personal information, ‘and weapons of mass destruction (chemical/ bio weaponry, nukes, and anything used to make them)"

Do you seriously think an online message under your pseudonym counts as "evidence"? Is there no way that could be faked? No way at all?
Do keep in mind they had the opportunity to charge him with five murder-for-hire counts in this fresh new round of charges and they didn't.
I'm not making any judgments on guilty or not guilty until I see the evidence that comes out in trial. But I am a bit of a fan of the "innocent until proven..." stuff

"As mentioned several times in the video, the law enforcement are attempting to expand their laws to cover and ever-larger scope of cases and situations."
It's called Function Creep. Here in Australia they are introducing laws to retain metadata on everyone "for reasons of national security". Yet to find any evidence that real-treal terrorists have been caught in this way. 
The worry is that once the law is in place it will be used for lesser crimes (that are "like" terrorism, then a lesser crime that is "like" the lesser crime that is "like" terrorism and so on)

Several of the early mods and admins did so. Some exited when they sensed change and odd things going on in early/mid 2013.
As for others, the owners of Atlantis were breakaways from Silk Road and they got away (presumably with the funds still held in accounts). Backopy, owner of Black Market Reloaded also got away cleanly, though that has nothing to do with Silk Road, other than he decided he didn't want his market being the No.1 after SR closed down and chose to make a very wise, very clean exit.

The funny thing is, many would welcome a return of Evo (source: lots of interviews). It was easily the most slick, professional DNM ever. Most people (buyers) only lost what was in their account at the time, and they told me they would happily go through that again if they could just have Evo back for a year. 
The small loss they made was like an admin fee for having a quality, reliable market for a year.
I'm not championing Evo by any means, but that is the surprise result of what has been told to me.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:01:19
Did you notice they introduced "red" today?
Journal entry:
"9/19 to 9/25/2013 red got in a jam and needed 500,000 to get out. Ultimately he convinced me to give it to him but I got his ID first and had Cimon send Harry, his new soldier of fortune to Vancouver to get $800,000 in cash to cover it. Red has been mainly out of communication, but I haven't lost hope. 
So, its suggesting that DPR/Ulbricht was still in touch with "redandwhite" (I'm making the assumption that red=redandwhite), the alleged hitman of Tony76+co, and was bailing him out [being extorted?] for another 500K?
@_date: 2015-01-23 08:58:57
The redacted parts are very interesting.  I'd love to know what they say.
This little nugget:
"r&amp;w flaked out and disappeared with my 1/2 mil. " - there was no mention of what THIS particular 1/2 mil was for. Another hit? Or did he discover there were no hits.
Then later he says: "red got in a jam and needed $500k to get out. ultimately he convinced me to give it to him, but I got his ID first and had cimon send harry, his new soldier of fortune, to vancouver to get $800k in cash to cover it. red has been mainly out of communication, but i haven't lost hope."
We seem to be missing a lot of the picture here.
Did anyone else have the thought that Variety Jones/Cimon was redandwhite and was just scamming the crap out of DPR? He would certainly be best placed to do so...

Does StExo sound a bit like VJ? From Oracle's memoirs:
"StExo had been a colouful character on the original SR 1 scene. He had done some work for DPR1, including a site crawl/security audit of the original Silk Road site. He had offered money laundering advise as a service. Based in the UK, he had vended (through reshipment deals with at least 1 another well known vendor) Xanax and other wares. He was also a confidant of DPR1/Ross. In one particularly bizarre event, it was revealed by StExo to DPR1 that a Canadian professor who had previously assisted in law enforcement was working on a “trawl” of the entire SR site, harvesting every bit of data in hopes of archiving and potentially unmasking the servers and/or operator. This news, when brought to DPR1’s attention, allegedly resulted in the poor professors life being threatened! StExo and DPR1 spoke of possible scenarios, one of which involved putting a contract on the professors head! Very “Breaking Bad” -esque (which incidentally was a show StExo was a fan of). To my knowledge, the Canadian academic was never actually harmed, but was threatened to back off. "

It is kind of frightening that people are asserting things in this thread that they are 100% *sure* are true, which simply are not.
[I wrote a book about Silk Road]( so I've been [following it pretty closely since almost its inception](
There were no hitman services available on Silk Road. The entire site had a policy of not selling anything the purpose of which was to harm or defraud others
Ross Ulbricht was never charged for any murder-for-hire or attempted murder-for-hire. Five were dropped, and one charge is parked in Baltimore, but that will never see the light of day because the corruption of Force and Bridges, the two cops involved in the case, was so immense that everything they touched was tainted.
[There is evidence of tampering with the logs]( There is another rogue agent, as yet unidentified, who did a very good job of covering his/her tracks.
I'm not crying that Ross is innocent of all charges, but I find it scary that if enough people repeat rumours, eventually they become "facts" of history

There were weapons at the beginning. There was a big philosophical debate about whether they should be there or not (I'd link you to the blog I did about it at the time, but apparently that pisses some people off around here) and then they were hived off to a separate site, The Armory, which was later shut down due to lack of genuine transactions and thus lack of profitability.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:08:00
They were the ones that were found when the court failed to properly redact and exhibit that had some of DPR's email logins and passwords available for the world to see. Some journos got in and took snapshots of his email correspondence before it was all deleted and among them were some urgent requests for to get in touch with him not long before Ulbricht's arrest.

Actually this is the one murder-for-hire charge that is still parked in Maryland. The five originally listed for the New York trial were all quietly dropped, although they were still allowed into evidence in the trial (those were the five that turned out to be a massive con job on DPR).
It is hard to see this one being allowed to be charged now though.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:37:29
I think they were most likely genuine. However, "most likely" shouldn't cut it in a criminal court where the remainder of a young man's life is at stake. They certainly *could* have been tampered with, and there is evidence that some of digital evidence *was* tampered with.
I think he would have received the same sentence regardless. It was political - they hated that Silk Road was so brazen and that it had followers who believed in the vision. It was very dangerous. There was no way they weren't going to make a massive example of him, but the murder-for-hire stuff made it more palatable for the public.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:25:56
Well there is a comparison. Law enforcement also got Lux, the owner of Hurt2theCore, where Daisy's Destruction was hosted alongside all manner of other photos and videos of children being tortured (literally tortured) and he personally provided advice on how to kidnap, torture and even murder children to cover up crimes.
Lux got 17 years.

The feds faked the picture of Curtis Green/Chronicpain/Flush. That attempted murder-for-hire is the sole outstanding unproven charge that is still in Baltimore. However, those same feds are the ones who are now in prison for stealing hundreds of thousands of $ in bitcoin. 
The reason DPR ordered that hit was he believed (a) Green was snitching (which he was right about) and (b) Green was stealing (which was in fact the corrupt feds using Green's account)

No, but it is sitting there dormant in case he gets off his current charges, so that they have something new to charge him with. Except they won't because the corruption of the LEAs involved in that one was so bad that everything they touch is tainted
