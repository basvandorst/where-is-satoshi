One reason the Fawkes method would be non-ideal in this instance is due to the added time delay that would be required, not only would you have to wait for transactions to be verified, you'd have to wait on the pre-signature to be verified too. 
Primarily though, using the Fawkes methodology would do nothing to protect clients from a malicious miner or node, which is my main concern. You say that it would, but I don't see how. Can you explain?
The only way I can think that it would work is if the network simply doesn't allow a transaction from an address after a Fawkes sig has been broadcasted, at least, not until the paired transaction is finally sent, and verified against the Fawkes sig. This, though, opens a can of worms by establishing a sort-of chokepoint, and would allow a DOS attack against the network/blockchain by flooding it with spammed Fawkes signatures with spoofed addresses and never sending the transactions. Otherwise, you still have the same problem that we have now, how would you verify that the Fawkes sig belongs to an address without releasing the public key?
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:11:13
this. :)
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:10:57
Based on my understanding, the public key of an address isn't known until btc is spent from that address. I'm not a bitcoin guru by any means, but I'd like to think I understand it pretty well. 
BTC addresses are basically base58 encoded ripemd hashes of the public key and some other data. For this reason, until a transaction is spent we don't know the sender's public key, only the hash of it.
Theoretically, if the ecdsa crypto that bitcoin uses is ever crackable, any unspent btc that lingers in an address could be theoretically stolen by using the known public key and transaction signatures to reverse engineer a private key. This is super highly unlikely, however.
A btc transaction is basically the public key and a signature made with the private key, and the transaction data, which isn't pertinent to this discussion. These two things, the pub key and hash, can be used to verify that the sender is the controller of a given address. Then to verify a transaction the network simply checks if the hash of the public key is the spender's address, and whether the transaction signature matches the public key.
So let's say we have a quantum computer that can reverse elliptic curve dsa and factor huge numbers quickly, using, say, Shor's or Grover's algos, it would still be pretty much impossible to reverse the private key just by knowing the address, and not the public key. This is one reason re-use of addresses is best avoided.
Change addresses are useful for this reason, and it's not recommended to have change sent back to the sending address, but it's up to the sender to determine whether they want that. The protocol doesn't restrict that aspect in any way. Most btc wallet clients, however, generate new addresses to receive change. So then when a transaction is sent, it could have multiple outputs. One being the recipient, and the other(s) being the change address(s). There's no way to know which is which. It could be inferred, possibly, if the address held a non-normal number amount of coins, say, 1.234567 coins, and someone spends .2 btc (disregard transaction fees for this example), then 1.034567 would be left over. But then you could just send .2 to one address, 1 to another, .03 to another, and .004567 to another, and from looking at the blockchain you'd have no way of knowing which address was the actual recipient, unless say, someone else is re-using a receiving address an it's the only address with multiple inputs. Anyway, that's a whole different topic of meta-data and pseudo-anonymity.
The only attack point I think would be if the network node you relay through when sending a transaction could theoretically employ a quantum mitm attack since they'd then have your public key since you are spending. You could send your transaction straight to a miner to avoid that attack vector, but a malicious quantum miner could still theoretically possibly generate an output and broadcast to the rest of the network before your transaction is validated. 
Thankfully that's a pretty easy problem to solve with something like Lamport sigs and avoiding re-use of addresses. Then this theoretical attack would pretty much be impossible since it would take trillions of trillions of computations to pull off, and chances are other miners on the network would validate the transaction and include it into a block before the malicious miner could pull off an attack. Then the malicious miner would have to out-run the rest of the network and attempt a 51% attack, again, basically impossible, given the distributed nature of the Bitcoin network.
Please correct me if I'm wrong. :)

You're forgetting the memory can simply be dumped and mirrored across a large cluster and attacked in parallel, virtually, on emulated hardware.... C'mon. Think harder. This is just one of many attack vectors.... not even getting into sidechannel attacks and actually having the CPU jump instructions to increment the wipe counter, which is completely feasible. It doesn't matter anyway, since the phone in question, an iPhone 5c DOES NOT HAVE A SECURE ENCLAVE. How can I make this any more clear? It's a non issue... This is trivial stuff, y'all. I'd expect the bitcoin community, out of all the others, to be more receptive to this type of information. I guess I expected too much...

The FBI wants something so simple they can just plug a phone in to some port and it cracks it. 
We're talking about two very different things here.
The FBI is trying to compel Apple into making it that easy for them, which in turn would make it that easy for anyone to do it... So it's not gonna happen.

Your words, not mine.
Stopping gross consumerism and massive environmental collapse has nothing to do with genocide or mass death of urban populations.
Either way, death is part of life, as has been the theme of this thread, but you seem to fear death for some reason. Death is not a bad thing, especially in an overpopulated world. I'm not advocating for it by any means, but it's not a bad thing either. Everything dies. In our current system and state, do you really think prolonging the life expectancy is going to help the state of things get better? It will just get way way worse, but you know... maybe that's what's needed. It has to get worse before it will get better, there are far too many people who are fat and happy.  Bread and circuses... you know? After all, we're all individuals, and full of ego and hatred towards one-another. We own private property, and exploit it for personal gain. Mine, mine mine mine, you are you and I'm me, right? See where I'm going with this? I'm advocating for paradigm shift, not genocide. We ALL share this place, and we ALL have to stand for it, and we ALL have to want things to be better, and we ALL have to do it together.

"Self" is an internal subjective reflection of your own consciousness. There are multiple levels and states of consciousness, thus, multiple selves.
Desire, especially at the expense of others, is a selfish emotion. Period... If you don't get that, then you don't understand what "self" and "desire" and "selfish" mean. It's okay to be selfish, that's your prerogative... but it seems like you have some sort of cognitive dissonance, believing that being selfish is bad, thus you get defensive about it, though you ARE being selfish. Cognitive dissonance is holding contradictory beliefs simultaneously.
If you're going to be selfish, at least, get to know yourself, fully... for real... down to the core.

banks only allow one to pull out cash, which is worthless paper that represents a value in their ledger. go to your bank and ask for btc, or gold, or silver... good luck.
all currency has arbitrary worth. what is value? then look at how that value is created... dollars are nothing more than ledger balances, and i mean that in the purest sense, not abstractly. the assets being bought with quantitative easing are literally dollars, nothing more than balances in a ledger. dollars, and quantitative easing, are both representative of a system which feeds back upon itself, thus each iteration yields lower and lower value as a result. it's essentially "value" from nothing. it's essentially the same as paying more for something than what it is worth. basically the fed is just saying "i'll eat the bill" and giving out dollars that have not been paid back.

Have you even read the "whitepaper"? Well, I have, and the concept of "mastercoin" is literally the EXACT same thing as what the federal reserve does to the US money supply. A private entity controls the supply of currency and grows/shrinks the money supply to balance supply and demand, thus controlling the currency and it's worth. It's a PRIVATE wallet, with a PRIVATE key, it's not open source in that regard. It's a SINGLE point of failure, and is NOT decentralized.
Mastercoin, on some level, sounds great, but then in reality, it's a blight upon bitcoin, a fucking parasite in the blockchain. If you really want to build a decentralized exchange, please, go for it, but all this Exodus Address controlling entity shit has gotta go, otherwise it's doomed from the start.
You wanna use the analogy of it being the HTTP to TCP if bitcoin is TCP and HTTP is mastercoin... fine... but don't build it into the damn blockchain like this first of all, and secondly, HTTP libraries are wholly separate from TCP libraries.
You're all killing bitcoin with this ponzi scheme shit. Fucking greed...

Not everyone is out to promote bitcoin for their own selfish gains.
For every greedy asshole there are 10 more people who actually care about what bitcoin ACTUALLY STANDS FOR.
If that's really what you believe, you should reevaluate your priorities, since obviously you are biased and putting your views onto others.

Most definitely, bitcoin is happening. We've hit the tipping point, I believe. It's like a match to a trail of gunpowder.

“Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.”
The same applies to death, as death is part of life.

You mean like the Federal Reserve in the US and all the regional branches? C'mon... It's the same shit.

that's how it starts, then you end up with [this](
edit: at least you didn't make [this]( mistake first.

this is rather myopic...
it IS peer to peer. there is no centralized party that you must communicate with.
sounds like you don't know what "peer to peer" really means.
peer to peer has never meant you connect directly, that is actually the exact opposite (client-&gt;server) or ad-hoc (client-&gt;client). bitcoin IS p2p, and if you don't understand that then you need to read about p2p:

but it will undoubtedly (in fiat) if things go well, and fucking who cares about ROI. it's about supporting the network and for the novelty factor and owning a piece of history. there is more at stake here than making a bunch of money off something from nothing.
haters gonna hate.

i want to get these and stick them on every business that I pass, guerrilla style, and then everyone else who goes there to spend their bitcoins can do the evangelizing, i just led them there. :P

This isn't entirely true... The processing companies do pass the cost of fraud back to their customers in the form of deposits and high fees.

Haha, whatever helps you sleep at night... I'm not trying to label anyone as anything.
I'm not religious, FYI, but I still think it's a bit immature of fnurtfnurt to disregard a charity solely based on the fact that they choose to represent themselves as having Christian values. THAT IS ALL that was meant by my statement. If there is something more that was interpreted from that, it's you projecting onto me...
That being said...
Break it down however you want... Most every "charity" has someone "profiting". I'm most certainly not advocating for that charity, either... The guy who runs that charity has been cast out by Christians as a heretic, btw. 
If you really want to help, get on a fucking plane and go there yourself, and help directly. Just a warning: you might not want to come back.

That is ridiculous... It would be paid off within 15 years. That is unheard of. Really, it depends on location, and the price of the lot. Are you including the home price in the lot price at 400k?

they are into it... they want to buy a bunch as an investment. they are pretty intelligent and open minded... so not surprising.
