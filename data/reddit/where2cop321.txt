Isn't that more like 1.9% if you use a cash back rewards card that gives you 1℅ Cashback at the minimum?
Plus if you pay by credit card you get a 0℅ 45 day float if you buy at the beginning of a new billing cycle.

Can't you pay for the exact amount (with no pre-auth) with the cashier!?
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:57:15
That's only for credit cards.

Bitcoin is close but no cigar for merchant/business invoices yet. For legitimate companies, I would also figure I'd be an accounting nightmare as well.
Plus the more you use your credit, the more you can build your credit rating as well as get approved for a higher credit line or a even a business loan. Bitcoin is pure 1:1 what you have in the bank is what you can pay.

What was the point of removing the option to use prepaid debit cards a week before they decided to forgo bitcoin altogether?

Add prepaid visa gift card to to a verified PayPal account and buy from virowx. (You're going to have a horrible exchange rate)
