Coinbase is expensive than Gemini.
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:32:10
You are welcome.

Yes, the core chain will become an altcoin in her mind

I bought 2 BTCs on Dec 2013 for $2100 and then transferred them to MT Cox for trade. And then they were all gone. I keep buy and hodling. Now I am break even too.

Do we get same kind of warrant if I buy Trezor from Amazon instead of your e-shop? thanks
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:52:24
2X is not the end of world. See 8 X in BCC. why don't you guys support engagement and let BTC move on.
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:21:44
Although I switched to Gemini for reason, to be fair, Coinbase did cancel my 2 BTCs order  in a favorable outcome for me in early 2014.

If core increase the block size for BTC, bcash will be terminated completely.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:39:44
I bought at $1170 on Dec 2013. A day before crashed. Still HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:27:31
again I do not think 2MB will affect decentralization which is FUD. Core did do great job but they can maintain 2x too.

Why don't you sell GBTC and buy BTC? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:21:21
Are u too native or just troll
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:10:18
Hope 2X will surrender in last minutes but if not.... who should take responsible?

This is bad for BTC and bullish for BCH. Why you guys so happy? Stupid!
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:04:49
I always wonder why core doesn't write a better seg2x and take control back. then every body happy except Jeff Gazik.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:44:18
"That won't happen" why?because of political reason?

I gave my friend 0.1 BTC 2+ years ago since he paid for my golf game. Now It is exact  10 X of original price. I sure he still remembe his password in blockchain.info.

The fastest path should  just do "Hong Kong agreement".
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:53:08
They need me send my device back first. but my BTC are still inside. Do you suggest I have to transfer BTC to coinbase? a big headache.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:13:33
really tire of you
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:38:34
obviously not by BS
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:15:57
Really hope Core or BS can provider better mining machines.
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:59:51
there are 86% chance of correctness.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:39:08
Great point. At this time, I hope Core help debug and test 2X and move forward with community. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:40:37
Does this mean I could get my BTC lost in Gox back ?

Core is the number one problem who broke the the agreement and get paid evil company.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:38:00
What is wrong with you? this is not misleading. I tried those steps so many time and on different machines. did not work. Tech Support knew this  issue and offer a new replacement.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:26:42
be ware of trzoer, version 1.3.0 just can't update firmware. so you can not get any BCC. contacting support, we have to mail the invalid device back first to get it replaced. but my device still have BTC inside. Too bad.
@_date: 2017-07-17 04:43:59
Please do not assume user are all with core. I am an average user and I am with NYA.
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:25:47
I glad to see there are about 50% positive comments about it. As an average HODLer. I want all sides work together to make BTC great again. Who said this sub prohibits free discussion. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:37:52


Do you mean BS try to make profit from side chain by limit size to 1 MB.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:35:57
Definitely you are not a reasonable user.

"Why don't you shitpost on Reddit less and actually open your fucking eyes and ears and absorb information?"
Everything you just said would apply equally to you.

Even though core says they are ok with a hard fork to 2MB (they have it on their own roadmap, just very far in the future), they refuse to prioritize it. They prefer to withhold something that could help the network now, because they don’t trust the community to make educated decisions in the future. They view themselves as the central planners of the network, and protectors of the people. They seem ok with watching bitcoin fail, as long as they don’t compromise on their principles.
Being high IQ is not enough for a team to succeed. You need to make reasonable trade offs, collaborate, be welcoming, communicate, and be easy to work with. Any team that doesn’t have this will be unable to attract top talent and will struggle long term. In my opinion, perhaps the biggest risk in bitcoin right now is, ironically, one of the things that has helped it the most in the past: the bitcoin core developers.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:33:15
Yes, I am a user too. I support Segwit2x. Blockstream have no single user.

Great comment. This sub need more seasonal user less extremist.

I know core does not like it but are they are going to help debug and test?
