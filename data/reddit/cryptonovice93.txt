Probably similar circumstances.

When is this shitball market going to turn around already and not be yet another fake out. Got in over a year ago and Id be better off in the stock market for 5% of the stress and even more gains. This shit is full of pajeet scams . -85% from ATH across the board for over 240 days. Gee what an amazing investment. I love being robbed blind by greedy teams and VC firms who could give 2 shits about what they're invested in aside from dumping on people after their pre-sale did a 50x+ roi
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:22:59
Intelligent yes.
Patient - arguable
Lesson learnt - Take profits, never "HODL"

It crashed because mt gox wash traded its value up to 1200 then went MIA for 2 years.  Just like tether wash traded its value from 1200 to 20,000. That was the only reason why the "bear market" ended. What's the next scam going to be to bring us past 20k? You do realize 95% volume is currently USDT right? Have you looked at the volume of fiat pairings and "TrueUSD" etc? Absolutely pitiful. If/When USDT collapses you will see how much bullshit this entire market really is

When China/Japan wake up, this is going straight to 6k

I lost $7,000 last night on long positions. Redeemed about $2,000 today shorting, I feel better that I didn't just bend over and get ass reamed by whales/ be a bitch and accept my fate..
Keep holding strong
Depression is easy to fall into and it's real in this market. A lot
 of times in life when things are tough that's when you need to be most optimistic..conversely when things are great thats when you should be concerned.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:33:14
They're trying to shake you out. Who's they and did they tell you that?
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:03:43
Over 3 months of being -60% or worse from the ATH on BTC and ~-75% on alts. Fucking miserable market man. Everyday just is low volume sideways and dumping.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:18:58
little price movement? Its been dumping nonstop since mid Dec. It should have never went to 20k in the first place.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:23:28
This market fucking blows. All I do is be a degenerate gambler on bitmex now that its near impossible to make money elsewhere
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:05:24

Lol. That's how all of this clowns medium articles are. Then when you ask for sources he calls you a fanboy and asks you for counter sources.
His reasoning is so flawed that its hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:28:51
Is this shit ever going to end? BTC is about decentralization and unironically leads to the same issue of the top wealth dictating how markets behave. There is no such thing as decentralization
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:31:46
Markets not being decentralized = technology not being decentralized.
Lol traders have been closing out their positions all week, crypto is no better than playing craps at the casino. Shit is dumb
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:15:10
yep. What a surprise, that 440 btc buy wall on 8600 is gone and its getting dumped into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:32:01
That's true. Apparently it was the CEO of Binance reporting that they did infact receive a letter from Japanese lawyers about the KYC issue that was reported this morning.
Just like that, from a tweet, we dipped from 9150 to almost 8300 in less than 12 hrs
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:05:41
2018 is gonna be huge guys 
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:50:06
The answer lies within. Look at your life, are you in a bull trend or a multi year bear market?
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:45:35
When is this archaic, non useful diahrea coin going to stop dumping? Its like its been fed 2 family packs of laxatives and the alt coin market is the toilet bowl.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:14:16
When you buy the dip and it keeps dipping. Nobody wants to invest in this shitty market when low volume drags us up and then we get dumped on with 4x the volume 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:03:21
This market takes more dumps than an infant. Its clearly being propped up and theres no interest in buying anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:17:37
Look it up. Cuckerberg is a known liberal that helped vet out russian allegations in the election and pinpoint private user data/advertising for HRC
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:05:34
When is this shit going to end already? Wall st people that offed themselves in the 2008 crash look like pansies compared to this. EVERY DAY is the equivalent of that dip 
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:18:16
Sorry to say buddy, but you are in fact brainwashed. You've been fed lies since 2004, a chain succession stemming from George Bush to Obama and Hillary Clinton. Its not so ridiculous when the truth is starting to emerge, is it? There is a slow bleed of data that has been coming out since the start of the election. A lot of the ties to Russian intervention are largely overexxagerated propoganda that was put into place by a joint effort of Obama, the Clintons, and the Democratic party. This was all in the beginning stages of trying to solidify a victory for HRC and to remove Bernie Sanders from the picture.
Julian Assange and Snowden have been jointly leaking the information for years now, and as more critical information linked to corruptions within the coverup have become available in Q4 2017 -Q1 2018, things are starting to really make sense now. Its only a matter of time before the domino effect of HRC and her disgusting network are continually exposed. The cover ups have lasted for too long and Julian Assange has been forcibly cut from access in Ecuador with recent leaks. They can't hide forever and they won't. Everyone involved in that disgusting network of attempting to rig the democratic election, cover up pedophilia on a national level, and misuse global rights charity funds are the lowest scum of the Earth imaginable. They've only survived for so long because of their status within the government and protections by parties that are starting to lose traction with the details that continue to emerge.
I bet you will adamantly defend Mark Zuckerberg for his involvement in the election too. Even if you dislike Donald Trump, the fact that he violated privacy laws and used a social media platform for political influence says a lot. "Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as "surveillance companies." Their rebranding as "social media" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense."
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:23:53
It just amazes me how small news stories warrant a -10% daily crash, even though we all know its manipulation. The cover stories are there just to justify why its crashing. Nevermind the countless larger stories of adoption and growth, we lose $2.5k in a week off of BTC because Mark Cuckerberg, known data manipulator and unethical businessman, deems ICOs to be "dangerous". Give me a break
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:06:10
Can these tards stop messing with my gains already? Its bad enough I had to sit around while some Mt. Gox goyim cashes out on me, now I have all of Asia selling. Don't you all realize if we keep buying together we can all be rich, after I cash out?
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:37:58
Fucking whales stop messing with my head. I been waking up depressed for 3 months 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:46:44


@_date: 2018-03-09 16:38:39
Whales are cashing out. BTC is highly overvalued and big money is starting to realize its time to abandon ship. The average majority will be left getting screwed over, same story different movie.
Thank you for your donation to the elite upper class again, be sure to pass by Wall St on your way to the credit consolidation office and thank your local hedge fund manager for the opportunity to gamble in his market.

Its spring, can I just start putting leases on Lambos already? I'm not going to pick up chicks at the local high school with my damn station wagon!
