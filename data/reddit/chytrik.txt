Extremely efficient ASICs are extremely efficient because they are built to do one thing: hash a certain algorithm, with extreme efficiency. The physical architecture of the chip is what accomplishes this, it is not possible to make one chip that mines a whole bunch of different algorithms, while also being more efficient than an ASIC chip designed for a specific one of those algorithms.

How is the Merkle root computed (for tx validation) for a block that has had a branch of txs pruned off? My understanding is that the intermediate nodes in the Merkle tree are not explicitly stored in the block, instead the block contains just the Merkle root as a cryptographic commitment, and the tx data itself.
It seems to me that pruning would break SPV. How could a litewallet client verify a tx spending an old utxo if the network’s nodes cannot provide the Merkle Tree’s leaves or intermediate nodes to it upon request?

This article has a *really* bad take. Like, *really, really bad*.  
Suggesting that the Libra project will allow govts to combat money laundering more easily is true, but it is a future any reasonable person should dread. Who on Earth would think *"Good thing we stopped these financial criminals by completely sacrificing EVERYBODY'S privacy to a group of corporations"?* That is simply terrifying.  
The reality is: Bitcoin allows financial *freedom*. As in, the opposite of 'stopping money laundering'.  
Can you imagine watching the internet grow, and thinking 'Oh yea, this is great, we'll really be able to control the spread of information now'. This is very obviously false! The internet allows for freedom of information, and the same is true for Bitcoin: it is going to allow an unrestricted and borderless economy to be born online, granting freedom of finance to the world.

Any network security issues due to insufficient miner rewards would become apparent far sooner than 100 years. Stealing unmoved coins is not a viable solution to that (potential) problem.
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:55:38
A transaction is composed of inputs, and outputs. Each input must be an already-existing UTXO (which will be consumed by the transaction), and each output is a newly created UTXO. Each node keeps a database of all valid UTXOs, so for any transaction to be valid, it must use one of those UTXOs as input, and provide a valid signature for the script that is locking that UTXO. 
So if you create a transaction using coins (a UTXO) that doesn’t exist, then the network’s nodes will simply reject it as soon as they hear about it, and they will not relay it to their peers.

Posting your idea is the best first step. Get some initial feedback, and then decide if it is worth pursuing further. Reddit isn't the best place for actual technical discussions, but if you're still developing a wider understanding of how the network works, then it also isn't the worst place to post.
Anyways, I don't expect an idea like this would ever be accepted (its been suggested many times before), for some of the following reasons:
\- It is highly presumptuous that unmoved coins are lost. 
\- 'Too much scarcity' is not a real problem; the Bitcoin network could start tracking sub-satoshi amounts if needed. This has been discussed in more detail in many places. 
\- If the miner reward scheme is insufficient in providing network security, then 'lost coins' being sporadically re-minted is certainly not a sustainable solution. If the system relies on user negligence to survive, then it is broken at its core.

It is very simple: If you are receiving a bitcoin transaction, you should verify that it is legit before releasing the goods/whatever to the person paying you. You can do this by running a node, and then you dot have to trust anybody to give you information about the validity of the transaction. 
If you don’t verify that a transaction is legit, then you will always be at risk of being scammed.

For answers to technical questions, see: [ There is a lot of great information on that site!
You're on exactly the right path: do your research, start with a small amount to get some hands-on experience using it, and then scale up if you are so inclined. Be wary, and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
[Here is a post with information about how to store Bitcoin securely for the long term.]( Every user will have a different situation, and different considerations. Do some research, consider your situation, and then develop a plan.
My quick list of things to do:- If you are technically-minded: [run a full node]( (bitcoin-core, btcd, etc). This is important. Use it to confirm that your transactions are legit, otherwise you will have to trust someone else to tell you this information. Use a wallet that can talk to your own node for privacy (or better yet, use an offline copy of bitcoin-core as your signing wallet).- If you must use an exchange service to buy, do **not** store coins on the exchange for any longer than needed.- Store your private keys on a device which **never** connects to the internet. Learn how to make good backups (see the first link above).- Be privacy-conscious. This will take some work to understand well, but it is worth it. Bitcoin can be incredibly liberating, or it could become incredibly draconian. [The wiki has an epic privacy section that is worth reading](

No bother at all, I'm happy to help. You're asking good questions!  
There is no such thing as 'offline transactions' in this regard, if you want to verify that transaction is valid, you will need to somehow be connected to the network. Transactions are always broadcast to the network, so that a miner can confirm it. Until a transaction is confirmed, it should be treated incomplete; there is always a chance it may not go through for whatever reason. So if you want to receive a Bitcoin transaction, you will want to wait for a confirmation (or multiple confirmations, depending on the value of the transaction received).
Otherwise, you could create a 'Bitcoin wallet' that never connects to the network, and creates infinite coins for you to spend. But no actual Bitcoin user would accept your coins/transactions, because they would be obviously counterfeit to anyone with a view of the network.  Thus, it would be very foolish to accept a Bitcoin transaction without a view of the network.

@_date: 2019-07-02 06:43:51
The genesis block is hard coded into the client, so there is no valid UTXO for the genesis block coinbase transaction (making it unspendable). But any funds sent to the same address are spendable, since a valid UTXO would exist for them (assuming someone (Satoshi) has the valid key for it, of course).

You can turn your wallet off now, its not that the coins 'come back to you', its that the nodes in the network will eventually drop your old, cheap tx in favour of a more recent one. There is a limit to the memory of every node, they do not store transactions forever.
Once enough nodes forget your transaction, you'll be able to publish a new transaction spending the coins again.
There are other ways to push a tx through, such as CPFP or RBF. You can do some research to figure out if your wallet supports these functions.

The charts are a visualization of some node's bitcoin transaction mempool. All of the transactions waiting to be confirmed are listed on that graph, with higher fee transactions listed at the top of the bands, and lowest fee at the bottom. Each different colour band is a different fee range.
You can see what fee rates are currently being confirmed by looking at which coloured bands are shrinking. If you want to be confirmed right away, pick a fee rate near the top end. You can gamble on a lower fee rate, but if network traffic increases at the same time, you might be stuck waiting a bit.

I think you're overestimating how much of bitcoin's future value depends on it being used as a replacement for financial instruments that already exist. I think there is much to be said for its ability to facilitate the creation of entirely new financial instruments, though obviously efficiency is important for any use!
I think your assertion that only 0.5% 'use it as a coin' probably too low of a number, but it also only further proves my point. What then are the remaining 99.5% of transactions? You can't pretend they're useless or worthless, clearly people are participating. Whether or not those tx represent people 'using it as a coin' or not isn't an important distinction. People **are** using it, because it has functionality not otherwise available to them, and developers are working on increasing that functionality every day. Bitcoin is a protocol, when more advanced tech is developed, it can be integrated if it proves itself useful and secure. 
Could we write  better TCP/IP if we started from scratch right now? Absolutely! But this would be a nightmare, due to the network effect of existing infrastructure. Bitcoin's network effect is slowly growing.. I honestly don't think your worry is completely unfounded, but I think the threat is shrinking a little every day.

Consider this quick math: If you had $100, and invested $5 into bitcoin, you would be left with $95 cash, and $5 bitcoin. Now if btc does 20x return, you have $95 cash, and $100 btc. 
So an investment of 5% of your capital two years ago would lead to btc being &gt;50% of your capital today.

A bitcoin mining farm could take on many different forms, but probably most commonly it will be a large, warehouse-like space, full of rack of specialized computer hardware called ASICs. 
ASICs are highly specialized computers, that are basically just good at one thing: mining bitcoins. The racks of them would be controlled by simple computer stations, and you could expect the warehouse to be very hot and loud (ASICs generate a lot of heat, and the fans that cool them are loud). 
Thats pretty much it, if you search on youtube you can probably find some videos with footage from inside bitcoin mining centres.

Scaling at the base layer is hard, I’m yet to see another cryptocurrency that solves this problem at a technical level. Larger/faster blocks provide only limited linear scaling, at the cost of higher resource intensity for nodes (very bad for decentralization, which is absolutely imperative). Other chains are ‘cheaper’ only because they do not have the demand for transactional space that bitcoin does right now. 
Higher level networks and applications that utilize the security of the base layer are a more technically sound way to scale in my opinion.

Assuming you're running bitcoind, you could set a couple of commands in your config file to minimize the bandwidth requirements for your node. These ones in particular may be helpful:
 `-maxconnections=&lt;n&gt;`  Maintain at most &lt;n&gt; connections to peers (default: 125)  
`-maxuploadtarget=&lt;n&gt;` Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h), 0 = no limit (default: 0)  
`-minrelaytxfee=&lt;amt&gt;` Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for relaying,
mining and transaction creation (default: 0.00001)  -- (If you set this to zero, you may be getting fed a huge amount of zero fee txs?)

Sure, you're right, but the efficiency of the heat sink isn't the important point here. You can release as much heat as you'd like underground, regardless of how good of a heat sink the surrounding rock is. In fact, this actually helps my point: a crappy heatsink will dissipate heat slower, meaning the planet would return to thermodynamic equilibrium slower. 
(so we can debate **why** a miner would put his machines inside a crappy heat sink, but at that point we could talk about the pirate miners too. I'm not sure how smart it is to float a small island of electronic equipment on salt water :p )
Alternatively: lets pretend that the majority of ASIC chips are concentrated in a half dozen spots on the earth's surface. In this case you are now heating a few specific places, and not much else. The result? The earth warms the same amount, but with local hotspots that will create some interesting and potentially dangerous weather fronts.  
This is why tropical storms happen on a somewhat predictable yearly schedule: the earth's tilt and orientation relative to the sun allows certain parts of the planet to be heated more during certain times of the year. The atmosphere slowly dissipates that heat, but not without some potentially violent air flows!
And so my point is: the way the energy is released into the system is important, especially if you live inside of it.

To clarify: the 12/24 word phrase you write down is a mnemonic seed phrase, it is not your private keys. The mnemonic is used by the wallet software to create your master private key, and then all your subsequent private keys will be based upon it. 
So if you have that seed phrase, you can input it into any compatible software and recreate your wallet (on multiple devices, if you'd like). So you can smash the ledger, and as long as you have the seed phrase, your bitcoins are safe. Just don't lose that phrase!! Consider making more than one copy and storing them in secure places.

Well, the atmosphere will be a better heatsink, no doubt. The atmosphere is large volume of gas, compared to a small volume of gas enclosed within solid rock for an underground operation. 
Think of it like this: if you captured 100% of the solar energy hitting the earth, and released it at a single point deep within the earth's crust, what would happen? Given a sufficient amount of time, that heat energy would dissipate and find equilibrium across the entire planet, but in the short term, it would suddenly get *really* cold on the surface. 
The total amount of energy is unchanged, but the distribution of that energy is important in the short term.

To address point b):
[This wiki page]( summarizes current risks of a large-scale sybil attack.
If your idea was introduced, it would introduce a new, larger and more potent risk. Allowing nodes to vote on a feature that changes consensus rules (such as the block size change) will result in a hard fork. In such a case there would be two potential outcomes for software running your BIP:
1. When a user votes on a change to consensus rules, they will also be choosing which blockchain their software will follow. This would not end well, and by that I mean it would literally cripple the usefulness of bitcoin core. 
2. Once 'all of the votes are in' (however that endpoint is decided), all nodes compare results and decide which features will be implemented across the entire network. This would also not end well, due to the MASSIVE potential for sybil attacks. I haven't seen you properly address this, and it is a critical issue.
tl;dr: Current sybil attack risks are low. Your suggestion would allow a sybil attacker to control the ability to change the consensus rules. That is a new, and very potent risk to the network.

This vaguely reminds me of an academic paper I read a while back, that was proposing a mathematical model for intelligence. In short, intelligence is measurable by an agent's ability to affect future states (greater ability = greater intelligence, according to the authors). I think this is a powerful idea, it was a very interesting paper. 
Tech systems such as Bitcoin allow agents a greater control over the world they live in, in the same way self-conscious intelligence allowed biological agents to dominate their ecosystems.

This is an interesting idea, but I don't see a way to make it work in practise. I imagine this is why it was removed as a BIP, as the technical foundation of the idea is not there.
If miners hold the vote, it may create a conflict of interests that cannot be ignored. I would also argue that the coders and computer scientists working on the code are more capable of making these sort of decisions in an informed manner. 
If full nodes hold the vote, then you effectively give the future of the code up to any person who has the capital to run a large number of nodes (or maybe just the technical know-how to spoof a node/vote). This is not a good outcome either.

Sure, I understand the idea, but my issue is in the technical implementation, I just don't understand how this could work without falling victim to a sybil attack?
Turning on/off features all in one place would be great, but there is a difference between a feature that changes the consensus rules, and one that does not. A feature that changes consensus rules (such as the block size change) will result in a hard fork. In such a case there would be two potential outcomes for software running your BIP:
1. When a user votes on a change to consensus rules, they will also be choosing which chain their software will follow. This would not end well.
2. Once 'all of the votes are in' (however that endpoint is decided), all nodes compare results and decide which features will be implemented across the network. This would also not end well, due to the MASSIVE potential for sybil attacks. I haven't seen you properly address this, and it is a *critical issue*.

No, because as the code currently stands, changing some lines of code would result in the attacker's node being rejected by the rest of the network (assuming the code change concerned consensus rules and created a hardfork, as was being discussed).
If this suggestion were introduced as a new BIP, then an attacker *would* be able to change the consensus rules as he/she sees fit, which is not acceptable. 


No, you are incorrect. Strawman arguments are tiresome.

I don't see the butterfly effect (BE) conflicting or otherwise affecting this definition, the BE speaks to the nature of the physical world that an agent resides in, not of the way the agent's intelligence is defined. 
More specifically: the paper defines the holding of a high entropic state as a measure of intelligence. The paper can be [found here]( if you are interested. The BE states that small changes to a system's initial state can lead to large and unpredictable changes in the system's future states. 
For example, two agents that reside in a world that is subject to the BE are able to have their intelligence level compared, since the BE does not depend on the entropic levels of the initial state - it only states that a change to an initial state can have unpredictable consequences far enough into the future. So simply comparing the agent's initial entropic states does not invoke the BE in a way that would affect the comparison. 
(I will concede that physically, taking a measurement of a system means you must interact with the system, thus physically changing it. Nonetheless, the BE speaks to the unpredictability of *future* states, so the instantaneous measurements recorded will still be validly comparable.)

This article is not very good, I'm not sure the author understands the technical aspects of the network well, or at least he is misrepresenting them. He makes it sounds like wallets are broken, but really he is just pointing out a danger of using a custodial wallet that relies on a commercial node service.
If you use a wallet that gives you full ownership and control of your keys, then you won't be at risk of the sort of hack he mentions. Further, running your own node removes all of the risks he is worried about. So you should do that :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:02:56
Running a full bitcoin node is not that expensive! A user can do so easily, and should if they can. 
A website like blockcypher has additional requirements that may be best taken care by employing a commercial node service (storage, security, bandwidth, parallel processing, etc). But that is beyond what any average user will need, and bitcoin is being built so that users will continue to have the option of running a node (or multiple nodes) themselves.

You cannot add to an existing channel (since each channel is a UTXO), but you can make the closing transaction also open a new channel (this is called s channel factory, you can search that term for more info).

If those nodes were closed, you could still connect to the network manually to download (and validate) the blockchain history.

Your best bet is probably using a wallet that works with your accessibility software, on a completely offline machine.

Your best bet is probably a hardware wallet, like a Trezor or Ledger. They are fairly easy to use, just follow the instructions carefully.

I concede its impossible to know without a doubt, but most of my personal experiences have been fairly suspect. There have been times where a customer opened a chargeback, but by corresponding with them I was able to resolve their issues / concerns. Then there have been times where a customer places an order, an item is shipped with tracking/signature, is confirmed as delivered, and then I receive a chargeback. Billing address and shipping address are correct, and their ip address matches. Try to contact them but never hear anything back. 
There are security issues with credit cards being used online. Instead of creating a more secure system, companies have created fees to cover their asses. I think this is lame, yet their system is unavoidable if you're an online retailer.

I'm sorry, but what is it I can't read? 


Sounds like a scam to me. You're claiming to be creating a coloured coin marketplace, so you need to raise funds? Show some accountability then. Your website has no information on who the devs / operators are, where you are based, or any sort of contact info other than an email address. 
On top of all of this, you are *not even using the colored coins for what they are designed to be used for*. Simply calling a coin 'red' is useless, the color is supposed to relate to a real-world asset. The closest thing to this on your site is the 'shares' in the website you can buy. If your shop only had these coins, along with an acceptable amount of info about the devs so as to create accountability, then I would be hesitant to call this a scam.
But for now, it looks like a scam.

Blockchain allows *you* to stay in control of your private keys, so *you* still control your BTC. This is different than an exchange's wallet, which does not give you control of the private keys.
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:55:54
I largely skimmed through it, so I may have missed some things, but noticeably:
It mentions “the best way” to store a private key is to memorize it, which is unbelievably dangerous. Granted, it goes on to say ‘don’t do this because you’ll probably forget’, but presenting it as the ‘best way’ may prompt someone to attempt to memorize their keys. Which is very, very bad advice. 
It mentions ‘open up this website, turn off your wifi, and print a paper wallet’. This is NOT a method of cold wallet generation, any sophisticated hacker could easily create a malicious program that could steal the keys and then communicate them once wifi is re-enabled. Antivirus programs are only reactive security, in the case of cryptocurrency security they are NOT sufficient to absolutely ensure your machine is clean. 
A true cold wallet is one which holds keys, and has NEVER been connected to the internet. The average PC is miles away from being safe enough to store crypto.

Your cryptographic method is slightly off. Here is what could be done:
OP writes a text file of instructions on how to decrypt the image. That file is then hashed, and the hash output is posted publicly. 
Using the privkey of the btc address encoded into the picture, OP could then sign a message that reads “I control the private key of address -ADDRESS-,here is the hash of the instructions to decipher the image -HASH-”
This would allow others to immediately verify that OP controls the address. And then once the funds have been claimed, OP could post the text file to prove the puzzle was authentic (as anyone could hash it to verify it matches the hash OP posted earlier). 
Note that OP could still claim the funds themselves, my method would not stop them rigging the puzzle in that way.

The color is irrelevant, it is simply the name used for this project. The posts selling 'red' coins as collectible (or whatever color) are just scams. 'Coloring' a coin simply means you are marking *that exact coin* to be tracked through the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-12-27 22:24:55
The question then becomes: is this reduced blockchain size worth the risk of introducing bugs to the system?
How do you account for old unspent coins in this reduced size? Ownership of old coins would need to be included in a new block, as the block referencing them is pruned from the chain. This would mean generating a lot of transactions that are simply 'updates' to already existing (but soon to be removed) information, which I don't find to be a particularly elegant solution.

local bitcoins has a number of options for payment, including direct bank transfers. They also have a reputation/rating system you can use to help verify a seller as legit. I've never used their service, but it is a popular website.
Alternately, you could sign up for one of the online exchanges. You'll have to give them some personal info (proof of address, ID, etc), but then you'll be able to trade your btc to cash with minimal fees (most localbitcoin sellers charge a commission). 
You could also check to see if there are any bitcoin meet up groups in Seattle, and contact them to see if anyone is interested in buying.

In your scenario, the big corporations involved would also have to control a significant amount of mining power. This is what keeps bitcoin secure, which is an important factor in it's value and usefulness. 
If they simply switched to accepting another crypto currency, how will they keep the new network secure? If everyone else is already mining bitcoin, why would they stop and switch? The computing power of the network is huge right now, that isn't something that can be easily reproduced. Sure they could start a network, but then whats to stop a few big miners from performing attacks on their network, to purposefully destabilize it? 
A scheme of your proportions just isn't a good idea for a company. The resources they would have to invest in order to pull it off are HUGE, mis-judging things would be disastrous, never mind the legal ramifications.
What if they come up with a way to secure the network that isn't through mining? Well that would be interesting, but that wouldn't be just 'copying the open-source code', that would be 'inventing a new technology'.

@_date: 2014-12-27 21:06:26
How do you ensure that, as a new node, you are connecting to the real network? Rogue nodes could spoof the block.
Further, how does the block get updated through time? What is there to prevent double spends? This is the whole reason behind the chain.
I don't see how this improves privacy. Scalability due to blockchain size will likely not be an issue in the long term - data storage and bandwidth should increase in capacity much faster than the blockchain increases in size. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:04:06
2014 is a year that will most likely see many more retailers begin accepting BTC - a crucial step for btc to become considered a legit currency by the masses.
Think of it this way: until recently, if you had a big pile of btc, there wasn't much you could do with it. Sure, you could buy and sell with other 'investors', but if you want to use it as a currency (i.e. buying goods) your choices were somewhat limited. Today there are more options for spending btc, so a btc holds more value for its owner. 
Sure, some big companies just convert back to fiat, but really, it wouldn't be the most prudent move for a massive firm to take a leap like that. Baby steps. Some smaller companies do indeed keep btc transactions in btc, this will probably extend to larger companies as adoption becomes more widespread.

True, but for a majority of users this isn't viable. Using a linux or ubuntu OS improves security, but convincing people to adopt a new OS so that they can adopt a new currency isn't going to happen anytime soon.

Just a thought - if someone were to employ a bot-net to upvote their content, they could do so relatively cheaply, as 95% of their 'vote value' would be returned to them. With enough up votes, their content would be presented to a larger audience, and they could have the potential to make back much more than the 5% lost to transaction fees. For every 18 bots employed by the attacker, only 1 authentic vote would be required in order to break even. 
Overall this is a neat concept, I don't mean to be negative, just trying to help you find some potential security holes :)
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:51:33
This is a fair point, but it does not negate what Rodyland said. Fiat currency will continue to work better for many purposes concerning the individual, but the BTC network will be much cheaper and more efficient for businesses, especially in the realm of international trade. It could make sense for a company to keep a reserve of BTC to use in payment to suppliers, etc, as it could be much cheaper than making payments using fiat.

You can also 'uncolor' coins, and they just revert to being a normal btc. So I guess that if a colored coin became worth more at market value, you could just uncolor it, and then color a smaller denomination to denote your good.
Generally, I don't think this will be an issue, as people will color extremely small denominations. I think it may be more likely that a good would become worthless and thus the color would hold no value.

For 2FA, I was referring to a method that uses an independent device (such as a cell phone), which imo is a much better / stronger method, as it requires a physical object owned by the user to be present. Email 2FA is indeed much easier to attack. I wonder what proportion of people opt for each type of 2FA? My gut tells me that most would use a secondary device, but I could be wrong.

Right now ASICs are improving quickly, and the demand for them is high. Thus the price of an ASIC miner is high, so the price of entry into mining reflects this. 
Once ASIC manufacturing catches up to the current limits of chip manufacturing, the price of an ASIC miner should drop, allowing more individuals to start mining. The rate of improvement between generations of ASIC should also drop, so a mining rig would become viable for a longer period of time. Hopefully this will help to decentralize the mining industry.
There are posts on the BTCtalk forum that go into heavy detail on the costs of electricity, heat management, and how these variables will play into the mining industry / price. A lot of smart people have put a lot of thought into this question (more than I have), so you should definitely take a look there if you're interested!

This still isn't an absolute security, since they would still be able to steal your daily limit. In a day-use hot wallet like the one OP described it would potentially only take a few days of attack to drain it, but obviously this depends on the limits defined by the user.
Having a 2FA device stolen is kind of a longshot compared to other threats, a more likely attack vector would be to gain access to unsecured wallet backups that blockchain optionally provides. 
You are right though, I won't deny that - multi-sig wallets are a security improvement. I've edited my post above to include the fact that simply logging in on a compromised computer could be enough to have an account drained. A fix to this is to add a second level encryption, and only use an onscreen keyboard to enter that password when sending funds.

Just remember to use a strong password (think: 15+ letters, numbers and symbols), and enable two factor authentication. Depending on how easy-to-access you'd like the wallet to be (will you be spending out of it daily? or storing it away long term?), you can also enable a second level encryption (basically, to spend BTC from the wallet, you must enter another unique password).

Actually, to delve into this a little deeper, bitcoin has really inspired me as of late. I've spent a lot of time researching various cryptographic and decentralized technologies; the possibility of using them to help restore privacy and power to the masses has me very excited and intrigued (sorry if that sounds too cliché :p). I'll definitely be staying involved as an advocate of these technologies, and I'm hoping I can lend my skills even more directly at some point in the future. 
Anyways, your generosity is appreciated, but it is late at night here, and my appetite is sated for the time being. I'm sure there is someone else who has made a meaningful contribution of some sort and is also hungry right now hehe. Cheers!

This is a noble proposal, but I'm not sure of it's viability. 
OpenSSL is probably one of the most reviewed pieces of software out there; even if there hasn't been a 'professional audit' of it, the same has been basically accomplished by security researchers around the world.
Given the importance and widespread use of SSL/TSL encryption, you had better believe that experts around the world are working to patch / scrutinize the code at this very moment. This problem affects economies at a much larger scale than Bitcoin, this community is a rather small fish in the pond that has been affected. 
Security is not an absolute, it is a constant battle. Even a professionally conducted audit will not guarantee security for all time.

I see two issues:
- how is the winner randomly chosen? The miners run the protocol, what is to stop them from manipulating the 'random' output?
- your second idea has been proposed many times before, and leads me to believe you don't come from a technical background (its ok, I don't either, but I'm learning more every day). The problem is this: how do you ensure a miner doesn't win two blocks in a row? IP addresses and other identifiers can be spoofed or newly generated quite easily, so unless an 'approved miner listing' was created, this wouldn't work (and creating such a thing is antithetical to the workings of the btc network).

This is a neat idea, but I see one flaw: a buyer must put their trust into the retailer / POS system to provide them with a 'change wallet' that is secure. The buyer must trust that the change wallet has the correct funds (trivial), but also that the change wallet's private key is 100% confidential. 
Someone mentioned a wallet that has a 'change address' built into it. I see this as a viable option, as it would allow the buyer to be in control their private keys at all times.

The value of bitcoin is a hard thing to grasp, because bitcoin is an entirely new type of thing, that has never existed before. It is a technology that enables people to do new things, and for that it is valuable. 
It is scarce, as there are only a certain number of bitcoins that will be created. And it is secure, as there is a ridiculously large amount of computing power working to verify and record transactions. 
Bitcoin provides utility, in a way no other thing has in the past. The fact that it also functions as a currency makes this exciting, we will be able to do a lot of things with money that we weren't able to before. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:55:37
Other payment processors do already exist, but bitcoin offers new possibilities they cannot. Perhaps a better system will be invented, one that offers all bitcoin has to offer and more - but in the meantime bitcoin has grown because it *is* a good, secure system that already exists.
[This article]( talks about how bitcoin is a 'many-sided' market, which means it is harder to disrupt and uproot. I doubt that bitcoin will 'last forever', but it currently has a huge first mover advantage, network effect, and a lot of smart people investing their time, money, and effort into it. 


I understand your point, but I dont think this is a matter of 'if a big-money company decides to try, they will succeed'. A true 'bitcoin 2.0' would need some seriously legit technological advancements to pull users, money, and miners away from bitcoin. Money helps develop these sorts of things, but there are no guarantees. Investing a lot into a project like this would be *extremely* risky for a company. 
Bitcoin has a long ways to go before it's technological limits are being pushed. There is so much that this tech can be used for, we've only started to scratch the surface. It is likely a wiser business decision to invest in developing these uses of bitcoin, rather than trying to reinvent the system itself.

This would not work. 
What is to stop you from having a photocopy of the paper wallet you just used to pay for something?
Immediately after making the transaction, you use your backup paper wallet to transfer the funds to a new address that you control (and the person you gave the paper wallet to doesn't).
TL;DR: When someone sends you coins, you have to ensure that you control the private keys, or else those coins aren't yours.

Ironically, I've only spent btc in person, never online.
I try to use it as often as possible, there are a couple of cafes, a couple of restaurants, and a few other businesses in my area that accept it. Usually I will make a purchase and then just buy more btc to replace what I spent.

You *could* do this, but then people would have to trust you to be truthful that the 'red' coin does represent 10 bitcoin. It really isn't a good example of the usefulness of this development, so if you see something along these lines online, just avoid it. It is more than likely a scam. 
The usefulness of colored coins comes from the ability to track ownership of a specific coin through the block chain ledger. A simple search of this subreddit should return some threads with good examples of why this is useful.

I have it, works fine, but the tx fee is hardwired to an older, much higher value.

But this would give total control of the ledger to whoever mines the block. That's the idea behind mining - you cant change old transactions. If every old public must be included in the new block, what's to stop someone from spending coins, then mining a block and just not including that spent output?

Right now ASICs are fairly expensive, and better ones are being created routinely. These continuing improvements won't continue forever at the same pace though, once ASIC manufacturers hit the limits of computer chip fabrication it should slow down slightly (this limit increases over time, but at a slower rate than ASICs are currently improving as they catch up to the limit). Also, once the supply increases it may be more affordable for everyday people to mine.

If your computer is compromised, only a cold storage method is viable, and he specified it must be a hot wallet. 
Set up 2FA on you block chain account, and make sure the backups are secured (e.g. 2FA on your email as well), at that point you're reasonably secure. Enter your password using an onscreen keyboard for added security if you're feeling extra cautious. 
EDIT: As pointed out, simply logging in on a compromised computer could be enough to have an account drained. A fix to this is to add a second level encryption, and only use an onscreen keyboard to enter that password when sending funds.

You can take a small denomination of bitcoin and 'color' it, meaning it now represents a real-world item, such as a share in a company, a car, etc. Thus, whoever owns the colored coin may claim ownership of the real-world item it represents. 
The upside to this is that it represents a cheap, decentralized method of tracking asset ownership. Does it make sense to track ownership of your car using the block-chain? Probably not, but this doesn't mean it isn't useful!
It is free to color a coin, but once it is colored the value will depend on what it represents!

Could bitcoin end up having a negative impact on society, due to its very nature of being '*programmable value*'? If all of the things in the world are slowly becoming programmable, then could all of our interactions with the world become quantifiable? 
Micropayments and removal of middlemen may lower the cost of everyday things, but is cheaper better if everything you do is billable? (i.e. cost of living is net lower, relatively, but you are always aware of the fact that all your interactions are recorded and billed).
It is important that we use the tech in a responsible manner.

I suppose my title is *slightly* wrong, as there is one transaction in the block (the reward being generated and sent to the miners). 
To clarify, I meant is there an incentive to mine a transaction-less block, over a transaction-filled block? Not including transactions would mean no transaction fees included in the reward for finding the block, so what is the advantage of not including transactions? Is there one?

I don't think this situation is impossible, but it does have a lot of "what if" style qualifiers. At any rate, Bitcoin is global, a certain country may try to impose rules on it's citizens, but that will only diminish btc'so usefulness in that specific country. Maybe many countries will band together to form a 'standard or regulation', but again this is a 'what if', not a certain future. 
I foresee governments regulating businesses to some degree, perhaps by issuing a master key that all of a company's addresses are generated using, thus providing an easily audited financial history. This on its own doesn't seem like a bad situation, businesses are already required to report earnings and pay taxes, having a blockchain history to do this could very well end up being more efficient and cost effective.

Oh, you're calling bitcoin an AI? I suppose in a *very* narrow sense, it could be seen as such, but I think that you could use different terms to more accurately communicate your argument. 
I completely disagree with your broad claim that "AI cannot work against us". I can easily imagine a scenario where someone writes some code that becomes widely used, but then contains bugs that eventually cause great harm to the system and the users of that system. In a more direct sense, black hats writing viruses or malware could be seen as 'AI working against us' (though I suppose you could argue that the malware AI is 'doing what was intended by its creator', which is why I mentioned the *unforeseen* bug example first)
Are you trying to make an argument against block size increases here? Saying that the bitcoin code as it is cannot be of detriment to those using it?

I don't see why this is necessary though - what is the gain?
Bitcoin was designed with the idea that addresses should only be used once, limiting the amount an address can hold to certain set denominations seems like a rather arbitrary decision to make. 
How do you send someone coins then? If they cannot generate a receiving address until the moment of the transaction, how do you actually send the coins to that specific person? You said:


How exactly would they derive the private key? This is the basis of the security of public key cryptography - you *cannot* derive a private key from a public key. Any scheme which involves transmitting any information that can lead to the discovery of a private key is inherently less secure than the current design.

Well, sure, but by the same argument, it is also the nature of the network to distribute pictures of horses along with every transaction. I mean, it *could* happen, if enough miners decided to run code that embeds a URL link to a random horse picture in every transaction. But why would they do that?
In your example, creating a blacklist would damage bitcoin. Who would adopt a system if they had to worry about being blacklisted from using it's core functions? Miners are invested in the system, so they're not going to do anything that jeopardizes their investment, similar to the 51% attack issue.

@_date: 2016-01-02 02:02:13
The code everyone is running (miners, full nodes), puts a cap on the number of coins created (21M total). To change this cap, the miners and full nodes would have to run some new, modified code that specifies a different limit (or no limit). 
If everyone switched over, then the cap on the number of coins would be changed. If only some people switched, then a fork would occur and two networks would exist (one with the 21M cap, one with the new cap). 
In any case, it seems unlikely that anyone would logically conclude raising or removing the cap is a good idea. Sure it is possible, but it is also against the interests of the parties involved. Raising the cap would make each coin worth less, so why would someone already invested in Bitcoin want to shrink their investment? I don't see it ever happening.

The Lightning network is live right now, you can run a LN node and send/receive payments. It isn’t just ‘in theory’, in fact I’ve had a node running for almost a year now. It is super fast to send and receive payments (usually, within a couple seconds), and each payment doesn’t require a miner’s fee, like when using the base layer Bitcoin. 
To join the network, you need to ‘open a channel’, which means sending a bitcoin transaction. But the miners fee from that transaction can be amortized across countless LN transactions, so it is a huge cost reduction compared to transaction on the base layer. 
It is still early for the tech, but in the coming years it will become much easier to use, and the network should become increasingly liquid. Whether it is used by the mainstream to buy coffee etc, remains to be seen, but it certainly presents some very interesting new use cases for developers to build out. Things that were not possible, or perhaps extremely difficult before, like micro-monetizing API calls. 
The cost of sending payments on LN is very low right now (most nodes charge 1 satoshi to help route a payment), but it is a free market situation so we’ll have to see how routing fees develop.

‘importaddress’ just imports a specified address, not a master public key. Note that importing an address will create a ‘watch only’ address which cannot be spent from (since the wallet will not know the private key), and in order to ascertain the address balance, bitcoin-core will need to rescan the blockchain in order to find relevant transaction, which can take a while depending on your hardware. If you know which blocks the relevant transactions are in with certainty, you can disable the full rescan, and instead just use ‘rescanblockchain’ to scan the specified range of blocks (this is potentially much faster).

The master public key is not stored in a transaction, this would be terrible for privacy. It is used to derive further public keys, allowing a user to maintain privacy by avoiding address reuse, while also keeping private keys safe because they can be generated and stored on a separate device.  Check out BIP32 for more info. 
A ‘regular bitcoin address’ is derived as follows: private key -&gt; public key -&gt; bitcoin address. Many transactions are ‘pay to public key hash’ (P2PKH), which is to say they pay to a bitcoin address. To spend that bitcoin later, the user must craft a transaction which provides a public key that hashes to the address, and a signature over the relevant part of the transaction that can be verified using said public key. And so the public key of an address is only revealed when spending, before that only the address will be known to the network. Keep in mind this is just -a- public key, not the master public key. The master public key includes the chain code that is required to derive further addresses, it is not ever included in transaction.

Find an old computer that hasn’t been online in years. If it predates bitcoin that’s a huge plus, because any supply chain vulnerabilities or backdoors won’t be a worry. 
Next, physically remove any networking/Bluetooth/connectivity hardware from it. Destroy Ethernet ports, etc.

Even if that is true, a tor-based mixer is still worse. Whoever is running a centralized mixer can easily de-anonymize outputs (using tor does not change anything about this, except the ability to also link an IP address, but often this IP-link is not needed to identify a user). 
Consider this: chain analysis is apparently a profitable business. Coinjoins hurt that profitability. So if I were a chain analysis company, then I would definitely run several mixers, that pretend to provide privacy, but really they are just information honeypots to fuel my business. 
Do. Not. Use. Centralized. Mixers. Even if decentralized mixers are not perfect, they provide MUCH stronger guarantees in certain ways.

I agree, I guess the question is: 
*As a user what powers do you expect 'those in charge' to hold?*


This is a potent point; a lesson that many ethereum users have just learned the hard way. To add on to it: a more complicated coding language will also leave more room for malicious actors to hide exploits in their contacts on purpose. Unless *every* contract is subjected to intense scrutiny and battle-testing, what guarantee does the average user have that their coins are safe when using these contracts? 
Perhaps the community would be best served by a codified annulment/roll-back procedure? Or at least, one that is well-defined in the English language (&amp; others) up front, so that there can be trust that political figures cannot game the system, as well as trust that buggy contracts will not leave a user robbed of their coins.

This is true, and perhaps this situation is rather straightforward in terms of what is 'right/wrong' (this is debatable, but lets say it is). 
However, it is quite easy to imagine situations where 'right/wrong' is not so easy to discern, so asking for community-driven arbitration of what has been advertised as 'unstoppable code' undermines one of the central tenets of the ethereum project.
As a user of the network, what guarantee do I have that social and political factors will not work against me in the future? The goal of the system, at least in my understanding of it, is to remove or greatly diminish these sorts of variables from the equation.
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:00:26
No, it entirely depends on what the developer of that wallet sets each rate at, and what the mempool (the list of unpublished transactions) looks like. Generally the minimum time for a transaction to confirm should be expected to be in the range of 10-20 mins if the fee rate used is at the top of the mempool.

Cracking SAH256 would not allow someone to spend lost coins. You'd need to break ECDSA in order to spend UTXOs locked to P2PK addresses, or to spend UTXOs locked to previously-spent-from P2PKH addresses. P2PK addresses hold about \~1 million BTC alone (mostly unmoved early miner rewards), so that is a pretty good bounty.   
You'd need to break ECDSA, SHA256 and RIPEMD160 in order to spend P2PKH locked UTXOs that haven't been previously spent from. Take a look at [Peter Todd's hash collision bounty addresses]( for some related fun.

The bitcoin source code exists in many, many places, not just github. Github happens to be the place that bitcoin devs share the actual code, but github itself does not own or gate-keep access to the code unilaterally. If it comes to the point that someone is unable to contribute to the project because of github's policies, then it will be time to move (and it will be very easy to do so, Github does \*not\* have the power to censor the project).   
I do empathize with your point about potential for abuse by those in (centralized) positions of power, but the fact that github is used to host bitcoin's code is currently not really much of an issue as things currently stand.

Ah I didn’t know about that mycelium functionality! Thanks for the info. 
I’m still unsure about this as a daily use thing though, storage isn’t the only time a key could be stolen. A key logger or something similar would be able to steal the private key while it is being input/used by the software, so while the key may exist on the phone for a shorter period of time, an attacker may be provided with additional ways to steal it. That’s a smaller worry, but worth mentioning. 
If you have a wallet that requires a pin/passcode, haven’t rooted your phone, and don’t use sms for 2FA, I think a mobile wallet is reasonably secure for small everyday spending amounts.

Bitcoin transactions are confirmed in order according to the fee paid. The higher fee rate (satoshis per virtual byte), the sooner the transaction will confirm. 
Wallet software will estimate how high the fee rate should be to get the transaction confirmed. ‘High priority’ or ‘medium priority’ are just relative terms picked by the wallet developers. There is not ‘set time’ that a transaction will take, depending on the fee rate. It is a highly dynamic system, even if you choose a high fee rate (‘priority’), there is a chance that 1000 other transactions are also about to be published to the network, with higher fees that will make your transaction take longer to confirm. Etc 
So you should expect that the higher priority fee rate will confirm sooner, but ‘sooner’ is just relative, not absolute.

I agree with you in theory, but in practical terms I think what I said holds true. 


It would definitely be possible to create a device according to your design, but i think it would make the level of trust required when accepting an OD stick higher. 
The barrier to successfully 'cracking' the physical 'must-break-to-reveal-private-key' is higher, if for no other reason that each OD stick would have to undergo a physical process to be cracked. In contrast, a stick that is designed to be reused could perhaps be cracked through careful software manipulation. 
If nothing else, looking at a device and thinking 'it's not broken open, the private key is still hidden' will probably feel safer to most people than 'the private key won't be revealed until this reversible button is pressed'. 
I'm trying to think more specifically... how would the device you described generate new private keys? If it does so without user input, then there will be a risk of the user finding the master seed, and being able to generate all subsequent private keys. If it is generated with user input, then what is to stop a user from providing the same input twice? Pulling seed data from a server or something similar brings in more trust issues still. These attacks may not be trivial to pull off, but I think they would be simpler to enact than physically altering each individual device. 
(If I'm forgetting something obvious here, please jump in to correct me)
Ultimately, I think it is inherently more difficult to trust unseeable code than the physical condition of an object.

The attack is effective because your wallet may craft a transaction that spends ALL of the dust UTXOs you were sent. This would mean potentially every address in your wallet is used as the input for a single transaction. 
Normally, your wallet will only use as many inputs as needed to spend the amount you specific. That may be 1 or more inputs, but not an input from every address- which is a possibility when your wallet controls a ton of dust UTXOs.

Nice, it looks like you're right. They have a pretty legit faq put together.


At first I was thinking "What is the advantage? You could just send a tx to them at that moment", but then I realized that this allows you to transfer the ownership of coins (ie secure ownership of a priv key) to someone without them having to supply you with a payment address. So use cases would include basically *any time someone is unable to share an address*. 
Basic example: you're out to dinner and have no cash, so a friend of a friend that is there with you covers your tab. Since it is a friend of a friend, they might not trust you enough to be comfortable carrying the debit forward, but luckily you have some bitcoin on your phone! Problem is their phone is dead, so they can't give you a payment address. Luckily you have an OD stick though, so you send a tx to it, give them the stick, and you're both good to go!
Depending on the cost of the re-usable OD, you could even factor it into the exchange. 
eg) "I owe you 0.1 btc, but this OD is worth 0.01 btc, so I'll just give you the stick, loaded with 0.09 btc"
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:30:43
You must pay a fee to the network for processing your tx (you could send it without a fee, but it may never confirm). So you can't just send *everything* as an output, because you need to use some of the balance towards the fee.

Afaik, settings in the GUI will be overridden by settings in your conf file, and settings in your conf file will be overridden by and command-line arguments passed when starting bitcoind.  
So if you create a .conf file in the default .conf file location, and in it declare your custom datadir, then you should be good to go just starting bitcoind without any additional commands. To use a non-default .conf location, you'll have to specify a path for the .conf file using `--conf=&lt;path-to-conf-file&gt;` when starting bitcoind.

This question emphasizes the important of maintaining a healthy network of full nodes: even if a majority of miners switch the rules (to allow something that wasn't allowed before, or change a parameter in the consensus layer), the nodes on the network will reject their new blocks, no matter how many miners switch. You *dont have to trust* the miners to be honest, you just have to run the node code you want to play by, and you'll connect to all the other nodes that want to play by the same rules as you. 
If users were not running nodes, then they would have to trust miners to maintain the network's rules. 


The answer to this is somewhat related to the answer above: working to make the network lean and efficient is important. The less resource intensive it is to run a node, the more nodes there will be. The developers of the bitcoin protocol are constantly working to improve the code in ways which help keep it easy to run a full node. 
Let me know if you have any other questions :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:09:46


Can you explain the method behind a 'key-generated nonce'? I'm assuming this would be taken care of in-device, since pulling the nonce from a server would introduce a layer of trust (that the server would never re-use a nonce value), and decrease the usability of the device (need to be internet connected in order to reset). However, if it is generated in-device, what is to stop an attacked from altering the code to re-use nonces? In this way, it seems like a 3rd party authentication system would actually be useful to the user.  
I imagine all of this would increase the cost of the device, but as you mentioned, the cost would factor in much less for a re-usable device. I do agree with your sentiment that the cost of the unit makes it tough to find legit use-cases for, thanks for taking the time to go into some of the specifics of this. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:58:34
This is a poor argument. If someone sends even *one* transaction and wants to run a full node to verify it fully, that is their decision to do so. 
Bitcoin is a _trustless_ system. It is not a 'unless you make X number of transactions you should just trust someone else' system. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:57:48
I think your solution would have to be software based though, which is inherently less 'verifiable' than a hardware solution ('if it is cracked open, its obvious and non-reversible'). 
The device's ability to be trustless is a function of its non-reusability... I'm not sure I can think of a way to circumvent this effectively.

Another counterpoint to your argument: what *law* should be applied? In which jurisdiction does a worldwide, decentralized network fall?
If you want to make an argument from the standpoint of (assumedly) US law, then why couldn't someone else make argument from the standpoint of a country with a dictator that rules that country's legal system as well?
*Dictator declares that Ethereum must fork immediately, to give all existing ether to the state controlled address!*
This doesn't work, the code itself is the 'law'. I'm sorry if you were wronged in this situation, but bringing err-able human expectation to codified 'law' is never going to work.

If the blockchain forks to chain A and chain B, and you want to transact on just chain A, then the tx you send to the network needs to be valid on *only* chain A. 'Replay protection' refers to changes in the source code of each chain, to make a transaction on A invalid on B, and vice versa. 
Without replay protection, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to ensure your tx only gets mined on the chain you want to transact on. I think it's obvious why this would be an issue.

I'd say that if there is an option to continue without writing the seed down, it should only be possible after clicking through several warnings about what can happen when you don't write your seed down. Writing down the seed phrase should be heavily-discouraged opt-out, not opt-in. If it is opt-in, you're going to lead some newbies to financial harm. 
I generally agree that giving a user choice is good, but in this case the risk of an uninformed user taking a shortcut and getting completely fucked over because of it is very large. Similarly, you could give the user the choice of just reusing a single address over and over, instead of generating a new one for every transaction. A lot of users would probably like this because it is easy, unchanging, etc, but that doesn't make it a good idea.
@_date: 2018-10-11 10:31:56
Do not do this! It is dangerous, you could lose all your bitcoin.
Here is why: when you import the private key to your phone, and then spend some bitcoin stored at that address, *your wallet will spend the* ***entire*** *unspent transaction output (UTXO) stored at that address*, not just part of it. Any excess BTC from your payment is sent to new a 'change address', which would be controlled by the wallet software. The paper wallet would be 'empty', so to speak. So if you delete your wallet afterwards, your coins would be lost forever.
There is no way to spend only part of a UTXO, so reusing a paper wallet is not a great plan in any case.
You could use a wallet that allows you to specify the input address as the change address, but I still wouldn't recommend this.


The second you input the key into the wallet once, it is no longer 'cold storage'. Cold storage keys \*never\* exist on an internet connected device. I think a hardware wallet would provide better usability (and security).

You can link physical property to a digital token, but if a big mean person comes along and steals your physical property, your token won't mean much. In that case, you'd have to appeal to a third party to mediate the situation (such as a legal court).  
Another problem Jimmy didn't address, that is more relevant to your response: what happens if your ownership of a physical object is represented by ownership of a token, and your keys are somehow lost or destroyed? If the ownership of my car is proven by my ability to sign a message with the associated token's private key, how do I prove ownership if the token is lost? I see this as a serious problem for tokenizing physical assets. Involving a third party that can re\-issue keys makes the use of blockchain superfluous in the first place, as anybody trading property would need to insure that the third party knows about the transaction (ie. that \*you\* now hold the keys that now control that asset). So the ultimate resolution of ownership comes down to the third party in that case, not the blockchain.

As a straightforward solution, lightning network transactions are instantaneous with low fees, so you could purchase stuff at a gas station, and the value would be immediately credited to the gas station's accounts, no waiting or risk involved. 
As the bitcoin network grows, we'll likely see more 'layer 2' solutions imagined and implemented, improving efficiency, functionality, and usability in ways we haven't quite imagined yet. Bitcoin will likely become better at functioning in the ways credit cards do, but it will also be able to function in entirely *new* ways, allowing us to do so much more. 
Personally, I'm more excited to see these new functions of value arise. Credit cards are already really good at being credit cards, I'm sure bitcoin will give them some competition, but I see the real value being in things that *credit cards can't do*.

I used Jaxx last night, which allows the user 3 choices for tx fees: Fast, Average, and SLOW. After checking the stats on the mempool for a few different nodes, I decided that the 'SLOW' fee option was best, since the network was not congested.
The problem is, the 'SLOW' fee was set to 460 sat/byte!! I also set up a tx with the 'Fast' fee option, and found it was set to 650 sat/byte.  
Considering txs with 30 sat/byte were going to clear, I was bummed that I couldn't manually set it any lower. 
This is an issue! We need easy-to-use phone wallets with more control over fees. I feel like developers didn't include this option in order to 'make it more user friendly', but overpaying by $5+ for a tx is not user friendly at all.

If that is the exchange’s policy, then they’ll attain that info from customers either way: 
- Bitcoin’s privacy is broken, and the exchange can track all coins/individuals, without having to ask the user. 
Or 
- Bitcoin users retain privacy, and can selectively reveal transaction histories to relevant third parties (like a regulated exchange). 
Note how the result is the same, but one option is Orwellian, while the other is liberating. In any case, Breaking Bitcoin to satisfy regulators is not tenable.

I wouldn’t recommend this, for two reasons:
- if you forget your encryption password, your coins are lost forever. Humans forget things all the time, head injuries are not uncommon
- microSD cards are not the most stable form of memory, they can become corrupt over time. 
If you’re super paranoid, using an offline machine to generate keys is great, but I would recommend using an HD wallet on that machine, and then engraving your seed phrase onto multiple metal (titanium?) plates. 
With many HD wallets, you can add a 13th/25th word as a ‘password’ on your account. So you still have the safety of a password in case your seed phrase is found. I would recommend also making a separate physical copy of your password (more than one is better!), and then store it in a different location as a memory failsafe.

I'm not sure I agree with this, because the nature of the owned object is different. When bitcoin private keys are lost, a tangible physical object is not left behind. Sure, there is a UTXO in the blockchain that will remain unclaimed, but I think that is different than the physicality of a car, or a house. Two people could argue about who owns the UTXO, but at the end of the day neither of them can move those coins. Two people can also argue about who owns the car, and that argument may lead to one of them walking away with the car (whether or not it is able to run without the lost privkeys, the car still exists and can be 'owned'). 


I agree, and in fact ownership of a bitcoin UTXO is a realization of this idea of *designing our own systems of ownership*. However, I'm still not sure that blockchain is the appropriate tool to redesign an ownership registry of physical objects. As I mentioned in my previous comment, if the system cannot reassign ownership without a third party intermediary, then the blockchain is unnecessary. As a quick example:
* I decide to sell my house to you, and so you pay me, and I transfer the ownership token to you on the blockchain
* I then file a 'Lost Key' report with the third party arbitrator, and they are able to issue a new key based on their record of ownership
* You haven't registered yourself with the third party, so they do not yet know about the sale, and thus they issue me a new key for the house, rendering your key useless
In this situation, you can see that the blockchain record is not the ultimate authority, and thus, utilizing it to maintain a record of ownership is unnecessary. We can create new systems of ownership, but a blockchain does not seem to have the properties needed to create a better system than the current one. 
I've heard some ideas of creating a decentralized system of dispute arbitration, but I think we are very far off having the sort of technology and social understanding that would be required to create a functional system that can address all of the nuances of ownership disputes. 
In all honesty, I don't think this issue completely precludes blockchains from being used as records of ownership, but I think the nature of the objects that can be tokenized is limited in scope.

Well, real-time voting is an idea that is implementable with or without using some sort of blockchain. Maybe thats worth exploring, but it isn't a blockchain that makes it suddenly possible. 
"If we can trust blockchain with currency, voting does not appear such a big risk."
Its not a matter of trusting it enough, its a matter of being the right tool for the job. The bitcoin blockchain allows users whom do not trust one another to come to consensus on the ordering of transactions. Voting doesn't have this same 'double spend problem' that needs to be solved, and the citizens also don't need the same sort of trustless system to record their votes. Citizens must inherently trust the system: a blockchain record is meaningless if the administrators choose to not adhere to the result (not to mention the fact the admin will assign keys to citizens, etc). A malicious admin could still rig the election, even if using a blockchain. There is plenty of ability for them to misbehave still, so the added cost of a decentralized system is without any real benefit in this regard.

Any well-reviewed and respected wallet which presents you with a seed phrase is giving you control of your keys. The ‘not your keys not your coins’ idea relates to using custodial wallets which only provide you with a login, and no seed phrase. Using the seed phrase, you can derive all private keys as needed (the wallet software will do this behind the scenes).
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:43:44
If the machine doesn’t transmit any data otherwise, then you’d be at less of a risk. The goal is to not allow an attacker to get a hold of your privatekeys, so if no data is transmitted they’d need physical access to the device the get them. Punch card isn’t necessary just get a printer without wifi capabilities, and only ever use it to print keys from that same computer.

If you’d like to run additional nodes in the cloud, in order to ensure your primary node has an accurate network-view, I would say that would be a good use of a cloud-hosted node.

The seed phrase is used to derive all your keys. So having the seed phrase gives someone full control of any coins stored in that wallet. 
This means it is very important to keep a copy (or multiple copies!) of your seed phrase stored securely. You should NEVER EVER store your seed digitally (a photo, screenshot, text file, encrypted text file, etc), as this opens you up to a whole array of digital hacks. If your seed phrase is not stored digitally, it becomes much more difficult for an attacker to get a hold of it (they’d have to find the physical copy).
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:22:54
Most wallets these days are ‘HD wallets’ (hierarchical deterministic), which will give you a seed phrase to write down as a backup. With that seed, you can recreate your wallet later, if needed. 
So what you need to do is write that seed phrase down, using a pen and paper. Consider making multiple copies, and store them in separate locations. DO NOT store it digitally. DO NOT let anyone else know what the phrase is. 
The goal is to keep the seed phrase safe, and reduce exposure of it to online devices that might be compromised.

Creating money out of thin air and giving it to voters (so they can allot it to candidates, or whatever) is something that could just as easily be done using a centralized system (after all, there is a centralized authority issuing the money and acting on the vote's results, so you have to trust them to do this honestly).
A blockchain does not give any benefit in a situation **where you must trust some centralized authority to act on or legitimize the value transfer**. If my govt uses a blockchain to give me $1000 and then vote on some societal issue, the blockchain won't matter if they decide not to honour the vote, or the value of the tokens given. If we have to trust them, then why not create a centralized system that can accomplish the same goals, with a lower cost?

What you've done, at a basic level, is create two pieces of information that must be combined in order to recreate your wallet \(cypher key and cypher text\), rather than just the usual one piece of information \(seed phrase\). My gut reaction is that there are simpler ways to create a 2\-piece system, that don't involve home\-brewed cypher systems that may be insecure, error prone, or forgotten. For example, splitting a seed into two pieces and storing them in separate locations is a scheme I have heard of people employing.   
Creating your own cypher is not a good idea, unless you are a professional cryptographer that knows what they're doing, and has other professionals review your code to make sure its legit.   
And in any case, committing one piece of the puzzle to human memory is a dangerous game: memory is fallible. A simple bonk on the head can erase some important information.

The wallet will need to give you full custody of yours keys, if it is a custodial wallet then no.  
Otherwise, I would be somewhat wary of storing a significant amount of coin solely on an old phone like that. Phones are designed to connect to other devices and networks easily (wifi, bluetooth, NFC, etc), whereas with a cold wallet you would normally want the exact opposite: **always offline**.  
Keep in mind, no matter where you store your coins, having a good backup is essential. If something happened to that phone, you would still be able to recover your funds.

Thats not entirely true, and in fact the lack of options to easily connect a Ledger/Trezor to your own full node raises a few privacy concerns. Ledger/Trezor are the most newbie-friendly though, other options with similar or better security are generally tougher to use.   
The ColdCard hardware wallet is another great option worth mentioning.  
And of course, running an offline copy of bitcoin-core allows for high security, privacy, and extremely granular control of transactions (when used in tandem with your own online node).

Right, it won’t be tough for them to pinpoint who is running a node on their hardware. You could partially mitigate this by restricting connectivity to tor only, I suppose. 
I think it could easily be something beyond commercial incentives that results in an attack. The cloud servers admin could get compromised by a malicious actor with any number of motives. Or a govt pressures the cloud service provider into some attack, or forces them to doxx users. 
There are network level attacks (eg eclipse attacks) which are made much, much easier when you have a network architecture that involves a lot of hosted nodes.

Your argument is basically just 'what could go wrong?', so:

But something happens! Next season, there is a drought, and farmers only produce half as much rice (Y/2). So now everyone with a satoshi wants to buy their kg of rice, but not everyone will be able to, since there is only half as much. Eventually one smart person figures out "I can just pay 2 satoshi, and that'll make sure I get my kg of rice!". And with that, the system is broken.

I’d agree that developed nations have less to gain in these circumstances, but there is an issue that remains: tying a real-world asset to a blockchain involves an oracle in every case (ie, someone or something that reconciles the real-world with the chain). This isn’t an argument of semantics, it is a well-understood problem. 
My point is simply this: if the oracle exists, then users must trust this oracle, so if they cannot trust their govt (or whatever the relevant organization is) to accomplish the goal otherwise (run an election, keep track of land titles, etc), then an oraclized blockchain solution isn’t going to bring them any benefit. The fascist govt could still rig an election they organize, blockchain or not. If the users can trust the oracle, then they can maybe reap marginal gains. 
That said, having the entire world join an open financial system (native digital asset, not real-world asset) will be a social revolution unlike any other before it. If Bitcoin succeeds, it will be quite the change.

An ISP could block packets they identify as bitcoin traffic, but there are many ways to obfuscate your bitcoin transactions to get past a local ISP’s block. 
Transactions could be encrypted and sent to a service or node outside of the ISP’s block. Or you could send transactions via satellite uplink. Or you could send them via an SMS message service. Or... any other way some smart person will create if needed. It would be almost impossible to block the transactions of a capable and motivated user.

It is more correct to say ‘probabilistically immutable’, since mining is a financially incentivized, luck-based method of securing the network. It is possible for a low hashrate attacker to guess a valid block, first try, every try. But it is super, extremely unlikely. And so we just have probabilistic guarantees, not absolute guarantees. There is no known way to attain ‘absolute immutability’ for the history of an untrusted network of nodes in real time. This is a long-standing problem known as the Byzantine generals problem, and bitcoin offers a probabilistic solution for it.  
Some simple (or uninformed) explanations of bitcoin often just qualify the chain as ‘perfectly immutable’, but this is not true is a strict technical sense.
Also, with a majority of hashpower, an attacker can reliably rewrite the history of the chain. There are heavy financial incentives working against this, but it is very possible. 
There have been majority attacks (51% attacks) against other coins, and their histories have been rewritten in part. Immutability is not absolute. 
In the future, some of our tech may run on a blockchain (eg bitcoin), but if you’re holding out for ‘future versions of blockchain that will solve new problems’, well that just sounds like altcoin marketing promises. In any case, I think freedom of value of economy is much, much more interesting and important for humanity, than some new voting system or land title system with marginal gains over the legacy infrastructure.

Fair enough, but pretending a blockchain explorer will have any relevant info is misinformation. A fully legit and fully backed custodial service would likely fail against this method of investigation. But 100% I agree with the sentiment: not your keys not your coins. 
More importantly, using a blockchain explorer to check your own addresses is a *really* big privacy concern: now the block explorer service, and potentially your ISP (and anyone else listening) will know that you are interested in that specific address/transaction. This is a key method used to track users and transactions today. If a user must use a block explorer, connecting to it using Tor is essential.

Sure, but until Starbucks wants to accept BTC (as in, get paid out in BTC), it won't really matter who they're 'partnered with', its just another way for them to accept $s at this point. This is all just a great marketing ploy from Bakkt, that users latch onto in hopes of higher prices. It is the same sort of rhetoric that has been repeated in BTC forums for many, many years. Its great that Bitcoin is seeing more adoption and infrastructure, but I fail to see reason to believe that a KYC'd app allowing you to buy stuff at Starbucks will be some 'big moment' in Bitcoin adoption.

What you have just described is exactly the oracle problem: the oracle can be a single neutral third party, it doesn’t have to be a government. The fundamental issue still applies. 
I’m not saying there is no use for oracles, I’m sure there will be. Humans trust each other often, and I’m sure we can find ways to reliably extend this trust to blockchain-resolved situations. I just meant to point out that the ‘problems’ inherent to voting are not solved by a blockchain.

Voting is not a good application of blockchain technology. The requirement for the real-world administration of a vote precludes any 'decentralization'. There is no property of a blockchain that makes it more suitable for voting than the well-established methods that are in use today (a pen and a paper ballot, please).  
Additionally, the ability to *prove* how you voted introduces additional concerns about vote buying and intimidation.

I think there are some other businesses and services that would qualify as being 'bitcoin banks' as well, at least insofar as that term is currently loosely defined. A lot of exchanges offer bank-like function, Bakkt may not be touching fiat in their customer-facing app, but its hard to see the importance of that distinction when on the other hand their partners (eg Starbucks) will be paid out in fiat. I think 'Bitcoin Banks' of various sorts will become important parts of the ecosystem though (they already are, really), so I get the interest in it. 
Honestly, I find some of the work companies like blockstream are doing to be more interesting and revolutionary, even though it is very early days for the products they are building. Multi-sig accounts can provide great security benefits, and federated sidechains offer some very interesting trade-offs as well. I think a well-developed product using those solutions will be more interesting than what a KYCd exchange can offer. But time will tell!

I have not used mycelium, but I assume they use the standardized BIP32/39/44/84 recovery scheme. If yes, then it is no problem recovering coins using any other software that also uses this industry standard. 
The seed phrase is an enclosed master private key, the software will use that key to derive all subsequent private/public keypairs that you will store funds at. This derivation standard is defined in the BIPs I mentioned above. 
It is also worth writing down which wallet software you used, along with your seed phrase(including software version numbers, or at least the date). Many wallets use the same derivation path, but some use a custom path, so it’s worth knowing which software you used, in case you need to look this up.

Blockchains are not perfectly tamper-proof, they're probabilistically immutable via financial incentives-- and I don't mean to be pedantic, but that is an important difference (especially if you're considering a future with many, many chains). 
A central authority can also be held accountable for upholding immutability, for example they can issue results in a hash-linked list. If they attempt to backtrack and give users a different history, the users will be able to tell. Since the users have to trust the central authority in the first place (to admin the vote, or whatever), this additional trust is inconsequential: if the admin wants to cheat, the users will be able to tell (the history was changed!), but they won't be able to do anything about it. This is the same outcome as a situation where the admin contributes to an immutable ledger, but decides to cheat anyways: the users will know the admin is cheating (not honouring the immutable history), but they won't be able to do anything about it. 
Honestly, I don't mean to be super negative, but I've just seen 'blockchain' sold as the solution to so many problems that it doesn't really solve, at least not efficiently. There are other interesting applications of cryptographic techniques that solve real problems, no blockchain needed.
I agree about multisig implementations, I think there is some interesting and important work to be done there. Biometrics, not so much (at least, not as a password for security-intensive situations). 


That is a fair point, it is possible. The oracle problem remains, but if you must trust the oracle anyways, then it isn't really an issue.

A true cold wallet has keys which have *never* existed in the memory of an internet connected device (temporarily turning wifi off does not count). A good anti keylogger is not sufficient imo, there are other ways the data could be stolen. 
In any case, it’s a matter of ‘how much value are you securing, and how secure do you need it’. You might consider it reasonable to keep a smaller amount on a paper wallet generated by the ‘turn your wifi off method’, but many users do keep virgin machines in order to secure their funds. At a certain point, spending a few hundred dollars on a virgin PC is well worth it to protect your investments. The level of security employed by those users is not what this article describes.

If you are looking for good security and ease of use, I highly recommend a hardware wallet (ledger, Trezor, etc). They are very secure when used right (follow the instructions carefully!), but are not overly complicated for a new user. 
DO NOT just use a website to generate printable paper wallets, as some people recommend here. To do so safely, you need to use a brand new computer that has never connected to the internet, and a printer that does not have wifi, and will never connect to the internet again. Many tutorials recommend ‘turn off your wifi while making the paper wallet’. I think this is TERRIBLE advice, it would do nothing to stop a motivated and sophisticated hacker. (Hint: lots of money stored in cryptocurrency, lots of incentive for hackers!)
Extra step: You *should* run a node, so that you don’t have to trust anyone else or give up your privacy to interact with the network. DO NOT use your node to store coins though, this is generally unsafe unless you really know your stuff with network security. Use a separate machine for your wallet, but point your wallet at your node, and then do a celebration dance: you now have financial sovereignty over your btc!
Edit: if a hardware wallet is more than you’re willing to invest, a mobile wallet is probably the next best thing (but if you have a rooted/jailbroken phone, DO NOT use it to store crypto). Check out samurai, jaxx, bread, etc, to see what app you like best. Once you’ve made a very good backup of your seed phrase, you can even delete the wallet app, and then you just need to re-enter the phrase to recreate your wallet later. Pseudo-cold storage.

I've actually tried running blockbook, but didn't get as far as trying to plug it into a HWW. I assume you've [seen HWI as well]( It looks quite promising as a more straightforward solution. (and looking at it now, it seems like support for a wider range of HWWs is now ready! Cool)  
fwiw, I've played with the coldcard, and it is pretty legit. Much less user-friendly, but I think it has some good/interesting security features, and I like that it doesn't have to be USB-connected in order to run. I'm sure there are ways that it could be targeted to be vulnerable through the SD card slot (tinfoil hats on!), but the lack of *continuous* 2-way comms inherent to USB connected devices seems to be a plus, in this regard at least. Its also possible to use it for offline signing with Wasabi (no offline signing for coinjoins though), which is nice because Wasabi only communicates over Tor, so you get some privacy by default there.   
If nothing else, offline signing with CC/Wasabi is probably easier than some other comparable options currently available. But as far as OP's question: I'd still agree that trezor/ledger are a great option for less technical / new users. Much better security than a wallet on some old desktop/laptop, or a mobile wallet.

When you want to spend some bitcoin, you’ll create a transaction that spends the UTXO you own, and creates some new UTXO(s). Each UTXO will have a BTC value associated with it. 
For P2PKH transactions: The transaction will reference the UTXO you wish to spend, and it will include the public key for that address, and a signature that was made using the private key. 
Anyone that sees the transaction will be able to verify that:
- the public key hashes to the address, so it is the correct public key
- the private key can create a valid signature over that public key

It depends on the nature of the change. In a simplified sense, there are two categories of changes: changes that disallow something allowed before (soft fork), or changes that allow something that was disallowed before (hard fork). 
The difference is important: consider what happens if a rule change isn’t adopted by every single node. In the case of a soft fork, the old nodes that didn’t upgrade will still follow the chain (the rule change is just making things more strict, so old nodes don’t see any rules being broken). 
On the other hand, if the change is a hard fork, then old nodes that didn’t upgrade will reject the new chain, since it breaks the old rules (it allows something that wasn’t allowed before). 
So how do miners fit in? Well it is in their best interest to follow the chain with the most ‘economic activity’ behind it. They want the coins they receive for mining blocks to be worth the most possible, after all. 
So in either case, if miners really believe users will change the rules, then they will be smart to switch to the new rules as well. Not switching is just a loss of revenue: if *any* miner switches, they will get all of the rewards on the new chain. Miners that don’t switch will get less (or zero) rewards for staying on an old chain that users aren’t participating with anymore. Users won’t really care, but those miners that didn’t change will be losing out of potential revenue. So the miners are really serving the users, more than they are dictating anything about the networks rules.

Sure, I'd agree with that. I'm just pointing out that when you participate in an election, *you must inherently trust the election administrators and actuators*. Using a blockchain does not circumvent this. 
It is similar to the reason a blockchain is not a perfect land / title registry: if the govt that enforces land rights chooses to ignore the blockchain record, there is not much the citizen can do about that. They must *trust* the govt to play by the rules, no blockchain can force the govt to do so. So if you have to trust the govt anyways... why not just let them run the database in the first place?

ABRA asks for an email address upon signup. I’ve never uninstalled a wallet so fast. That’s just unnecessary and worrying, privacy-wise.
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:55:49
Honestly, at this point I’d be very worried about the security of your keys. You’ve now potentially made yourself a target, amplified by your admission that the seed is also stored digitally, and your home made cypher is probably useless against someone who knows how it works and has access to some computing power. The numbers you used for ‘number of random possibilities’ of your cyphertext are incorrect, since the ordering isn’t random, it’s based on a home made cypher. My guess is your method contains patterns which drastically reduce the randomness, and the time needed to crack the cypher. 
In any case, if you don’t trust your family, then who’s to say they don’t just write down the solution to your cypher, and then leave it out alongside the cyphertext? With this possibility in mind, your method is no more secure than splitting a 24 word seed into two, but it introduces a complicated cypher that may be a source of mistake, etc. 
If trust is an issue, split the seed and give half to your family, and the other half to a law firm, with instructions on who to deliver it to in case of your death, etc. 
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:56:54
One more thing: keep in mind that when you control your own keys, that means you are fully responsible for you coins. If you fuck up and lose your wallet and seed phrase, then your coins are gone forever, nobody will be able to help you recover them (including whoever made the wallet). Sovereignty comes with responsibility. It isn’t too hard to create good backups, but it is very important to do so correctly :)

If you don't have the multibit wallet file, or a backup of it, then unfortunately your coins are gone. Getting access to localbitcoins and finding the transfer out will tell you the address your coins reside at, but it will do nothing to help you recover them. For that, you need the private key that would be in the wallet file.
@_date: 2019-10-08 04:09:29
If you’re using a custodial wallet, then checking your balance using a block explorer isn’t really relevant. Most exchanges use internal bookkeeping for user funds, not actual on chain transactions/balances.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:23:29
This is all false: there are lots of phone wallets which allow you to have full custody of your keys. Every reputable wallet also follows some sort of standardized backup process (BIP 32/39/44/84/etc), so if a wallet company goes belly up, you can still easily recover your funds.
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:56:46
Sorry, I think you misunderstood me. In your reply you said a seed and a master private key are the same, but they are not. A master private key is *derived* from a seed. 
As an example, if you tried imported a seed (or seed phrase) into a wallet as a private key, it would not be valid. 
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:06:29
A simple analogy:
In a pre-internet world, one could have made predictions about the usefulness of electronic communication (what would later become email, IRC, social media, etc). By looking at pre-internet communication habits, one could have made predictions about how much of this communication would be carried out electronically in the future.
However, as we have seen, the openness and ease of access to electronic communication went far beyond this sort of prediction: as the internet grows, we see more and more communication happening electronically. Today, the average internet user communicates with a great number of people online each day, making the internet a valuable tool beyond what would be expected of a technology that simply took over some part of the total pre-internet communication. **Rather, the internet enabled a whole new paradigm of communication, that did not exist otherwise.**
Bitcoin could do the same. Freedom of information has been revolutionary,  freedom of economy (Bitcoin) might just allow humans to create and exchange value, in ways that did not exist before. This would push the network value beyond the simple S2F store-of-value investment model.
Not a perfect analogy, but I hope that makes enough sense to get the idea across.

If mining becomes unprofitable, then we'd expect some miners to stop mining. 
This means the remaining miners will receive a larger portion of the reward, thus increasing their profitability.
The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, to help normalize the rate of block production to be approximately 1 block / 10 minutes.   
As the block subsidy approaches zero, the transaction fees will become a more significant part of the block reward. By this mechanism, eventually transaction fees will become the entirety of the block reward.

But pruning does not solve the issues that lowering the blocksize attempts to solve. A pruned node must still download and validate all blockchain data, it just doesn't necessarily persistently store data not relevant to it's own transactions. Pruning helps with data storage requirements, but not computational cycles or (download) bandwidth requirements (which are more relevant here). 
I'm not in support of the decrease, I just wanted to make it clear what the issues are.  
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:25:49
Nothing needs to be replaced. If you think of a better solution, then you can build it, and if it is good, then users can use it. Many L2 solutions could exist independently (or interoperably). 
But otherwise I do agree: I think federated chains that are trust minimized will present some usability gains that will be very desirable for many users. Is that a perfect cypherpunk future? No. But even today, so many users just trust custodial solutions... I think federated sidechains legitimately provide a better solution than this in many ways.

While fees will not be unconditionally low, it sounds like your wallet software may have overestimated the fee rate for your tx. It’s worth using a wallet that allows a more manual/fine grained control of fees; doing so can potentially save you a lot of money.

If you want to access funds in a lightning channel, you’ll need to use the LN wallet that created that channel (or a wallet which continually talks to your LN node/wallet). 
If you just exported the LN node data into some regular on-chain wallet, it won’t know how to handle the LN channel UTXOs, so any attempt to spend them would most likely result in a loss of funds (as your tx which uses the LN channel UTXO will not represent a proper channel closing). 
The same issue could come from having two LN wallet instances running the same wallet: missing channel updates that the other wallet instance orchestrates could mean losing funds due to publishing an incorrect channel state. 
In theory, these issues could be overcome by adding some additional logic and checks, but I don’t believe any software currently includes these features.

I don't think it is reasonable to expect every newcomer to drop everything and embrace the cypherpunk roots of bitcoin. By using bitcoin they are buying into a system that embodies those values, but that doesn't mean they themselves must become a proponent of the cypherpunk ethos.   
With that in mind, I'd expect the largest bitcoin social media outlets to devolve into... well pretty much exactly what they've become. Memes, greed, big personalities, and drama, with a sprinkling of technical information here and there.   
That doesn't change the core of it though, and indeed if you look in the quieter places, there is a strong and still growing group of highly competent and technical people building what might become a very important system of value for our world. The moon-lambo-fanboys don't really detract from the work being done, I think bitcoin can work just fine, with or without them posting egregiously bullish memes.

That seems reasonable from a UX point of view, I've seen many complaints from users that 'didn't receive their funds?!', simply because their node hadn't finished syncing yet. 
I would have some concerns about privacy though, if during SPV operation the wallet leaks addresses/balance to network peers in order to sync. But I guess it is objectively better to only leak that info during bootstrap, as opposed to a continually operating SPV wallet.

The warning is telling you that you have not assigned a certain trust level to the key. The signature is valid for the key you have, so as long as you trust the key is correct, then the signature checked out. 
Think of it like this: you gave the software some key, but didn’t specify that you trust the key. So the software is saying “this sig is valid, but only for a key that we don’t know is trusted”.

Mining is a separate variable, the massive parallelism of nodes on the network is what I was talking about. It is by no means efficient, but it is necessary.

Most people here will probably say "yes!", but this is a decision you must make for yourself. Don't invest anything you aren't willing to lose 100% of. Seriously. 


Yes, having more or less than one makes no difference, you can still buy / sell / trade it however you please.


Mining involves runnning specialized computers that simply guess'n'check a complex math problem, and if the answer they get is a low enough number, they are 'rewarded' by being allowed to add the next block full of transactions to the network. Anyone can partake, but it is highly competitive so you'll need to know what you're doing to turn a profit (hardware and electricity costs factor in).


Yes, the 'market' runs 24 hrs a day, every day. As long as the network is up (it has 99.999% uptime) and you have someone to trade with, you can do so. 


Bitcoin is a young and potentially disruptive tech experiment, it has the potential to be worth a lot, but ultimately nobody really knows the value of the system. So expect a very wild ride: in the past, bitcoin has dropped 70%+ of its value from previous highs. It could drop to $800, or maybe even $0 if something really crazy happens. Do your research, and decide whether you believe in the tech itself, not just the hype of the price increase.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:39:43
That's just one level of it though, consider this: what if a new startup comes up with an even better version of your favourite website (like YouTube). Now, rather than having access to the entire world as an audience through the free and open internet, this company must bargain with ISPs to be added to a 'package', and end users must pay for the package, and why would they do that if youtube already exists?
This approach removes the low barriers of entry that have made the internet so successful. Good luck starting a new social network app if users have to pay up front to even sign up / test it out!

Biometrics are a terrible way to secure important things, just fyi. There are a couple simple reasons: 
- Any metric used is ultimately just reduced to some digital data when authentication takes place, so if someone intercepts that data somehow, they no longer require your fingerprint/retina/whatever to authenticate
- You cannot revoke a key. If your biometric data is somehow compromised and you need to change your password (your fingerprint, etc), how are you going to do that? This point is probably more of a concern than the first one.

It definitely does not feel like there is a CEO. What we just saw was a coalition of the 'most powerful people in the industry' fail to steer the direction of the network to their liking. Any 6 people could plan an attack like this, and similarly they can decide to call it off. Who cares? 
If 2X had succeeded, then your frustrations would be extremely valid, but it failed, because of the sort of decentralized, anarchic governance bitcoin employs.

True! I agree with all of that, but I suppose the worry is that in the future, the CPU resources needed to validate the chain during initial sync could become quite large. If the resources needed to bootstrap become too large, I'd reason that node count would go down over time.   
If Bitcoin does grow and succeed, and users understand the benefits of running their own node, then perhaps enduring a longer-than-ideal bootstrapping phase will be considered a worthy investment anyways.

- the price of the system is quite transparent, it isn't really fair to just forsake it outright, without being able to compare to other systems. How much energy does it take to run all of the banks/atms/etc in the world? Does the energy usage of bitcoin just *sound* like a lot? Or is it actually a lot?
- If it is a lot, then you have to understand that electricity is a **real cost** to miners, yet they are still making a profit. Why is that? Because people buying coins are in effect placing a bet on that electricity cost being *worth it, in order to create such a highly secure system*
- the cost of highly efficient solar panels is starting to drop quite noticeably, within a few years it may be only profitable to mine using cheap solar power
- a lot of people have decided that the system *is* worth the cost, so your friend can be upset about it if he wants, but that won't stop others from participating in the system. This isn't a good counter argument in itself, but it is the objective reality he must face ('non-participation risk')

*"Role of Govt will be reduced to protecting the rights of the digital asset holders."* this is exactly the issue: you need to trust them to protect the rights, according to what is on chain. The blockchain does not guarantee they will act fairly, any more than any other system would. If the govt thinks you shouldn't own land, it won't matter that a free and open blockchain allowed someone else to sell you the blockchain land title. 
Anyways, land registry is not a great use-case for a blockchain for other reasons as well. Simple example: What happens if you lose the private key for your house title? Now you can't prove you actually own it. How do you sell it in the future? If the govt can issue new keys... well then why are we paying for all the inefficiencies of a blockchain? If they can't issue new keys... well now what?
*"You can design an election system on blockchain with out trusting that many number of administrators or actuators."* it isn't about the number of people you need to trust (or employ to run the election). Even if there is only one single admin who can alter the system... well the existence of and trust in that admin precludes the benefits of using a blockchain to run the backend of the voting. (and a blockchain is otherwise an **extremely** inefficient database!!)
Digital voting security is a well-studied problem that pre-dates the invention of Bitcoin. There are system architectures that use cryptography in novel ways which can provide more efficiency and transparency, but blockchain has marketing buzzword hype, and so we see some 'blockchain voting' companies trying to get funding from uninformed investors.

And you will not be able to solve that problem, but it doesn't really matter, because lost coins are not a problem themselves in the first place. There is no problem to solve.
Here is an issue with it: lets say we say we set the timespan to 100 years. Fast forward to 2108, and Satoshi's coins still haven't moved. Everyone know it has been almost 100 years worth of blocks, so they are anticipating his coins being re-released. 
But what if he just moves them a few blocks before the time is up? If 1 millions coins are about to be rereleased as a block subsidy, then miners would be SCRAMBLING to get hashpower running. After all, the block reward would have dropped to a TINY fraction of a bitcoin at that point otherwise. 1 million new coins would be huge!
Okay, so maybe you don't give them to miners? Then how? Airdrop them to every address that has a balance, in proportion to the account balance? This just makes the same problem as above, but now users have to bet on whether or not the coins will move, by buying in/out of bitcoin. Not a good solution either!

- Generate a wallet, write down the seed.
- Open the wallet on your computer, check the receiving address. Copy it into a text file.
- Now unplug the ledger, plug it back in, and enter a wrong PIN 3 times. This will reset the device.
- Now use your seed to recreate the wallet on the ledger. Once done, open the wallet on your computer, and check the receiving address.
If it is the same, then you copied down your seed correctly, and now understand what will need to happen in case your device is reset/destroyed/whatever.

It wouldn't really matter if a key had an english word in it, that wouldn't allow someone to guess it any faster. 
Private keys are generated by use of a hash function, meaning you take some input, hash it, and end up with a random looking, but deterministic private key. The part about it being deterministic is important, it means if you use the same input twice, you'll get the same output each time.
The output of a hash function changes entirely with even the smallest change to the input, and it does so in an unpredictable way, so the only way to generate a private key, is through this sort of random process of inputting data, and seeing what comes out the other end. 
So if you were running a program that was searching through as many private keys as possible, thats all you're really doing: inputting random values, running the hash function, and then checking the addresses you generate for bitcoins. It doesn't really help you to look for english words in the private keys you generate, you're just going to check every single one. 
The good news is, there are soooo many possible addresses, that even if you had a super computer that was 1000 times more powerful than ALL of the computers on earth today, you still probably wouldn't create a truly random address that has already been used.
What you may have heard about before is [brain wallets]( not private/public keys that just happen to have english words in them. In general, brain wallets are not a good idea, but it is important to note that they are effectively different from the 12 word seeds used by many wallets these days.  
[EDIT: worth mentioning, you *do* technically know the private key to your ledger wallet. The master seed for your private keys is just a number,  encoded into a set of english words]

Your conclusion that you would be unable to prove the source of some coins after mixing is false. Using privacy-enhancing features doesn’t restrict you from doing this: you can preserve your privacy, while keeping the keys of addresses you used pre-mix. Proving ownership of those keys later can establish a history of your coins, if you so desire. 
The difference is that you can selectively reveal this history now. Instead of everyone having access to it, only those you need to show it to will be privy. 
Please, understand that the narrative of ‘Bitcoin taint’ is an attack on the system. A system where all coins are erroneously tracked and catalogued is an Orwellian nightmare, and a lack of fungibility in this way makes for a broken money system in the first place. Those in charge of the ‘taint list’ would have power over the rest.

Who is? In relation to what?
Satoshi's coins are currently an ongoing risk of some sort to the market price, but they do not pose an existential risk to the system. If he moved them, the price will drop, but its not like all the developers and businesses that are invested in the space would be like "Well, that was fun, but we're going to go do something else now". 
At any rate, the damage done by Satoshi moving his coins would likely be less than by your proposal. There are also issues with implementation (like I described above) , and ultimately: there is no real benefit to its implementation. 
Your original post asked what Satoshi would think? The quote I posted above actually outlines how lost coins benefit all other users already! What is there to improve upon?

Bread doesn't run nodes ('servers'), instead they point breadwallet at several known seeding nodes. 
If you'd like to remain on the bitcoin chain, you should look up a node that is run 15.x, and point your breadwallet app at it, using the advanced settings. The same is true if you want to follow S2X, just look up an S2X node. Otherwise a user may be unsure which chain their SPV wallet is connected to in the time following the fork, which is not good. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:37:47
Jaxx has three levels of fees you can choose from, bread has two. Neither tell you the sat/weight rate though, just the total fee. So it's tough to gauge where your tx will fall in the mempool, even with the options presented.

You misunderstood my reply, your coins are **not** in an 's2x' address. You still own bitcoin, full stop. There is nothing more to worry about.

@_date: 2017-11-30 09:32:30


That is not true. The value of bitcoin is determined by the market, and though the number is not known explicitly, the available liquidity is a determining factor in the price. So we do not need to know the exact number lost in order for the effect to happen. 
But either way, you didn't address the issues created by reissuing coins. Even if there was a good reason to implement your idea, there doesn't seem to be a good way to do it.

Here is a Satoshi quote about lost coins for you:


Satoshi was aware coins could be lost, but realized that losing coins doesn't hurt the system, only the user that lost the coins. So be careful not to lose your coins!

A node stores the entire blockchain history, uses it to verify transactions that it receives from other nodes, and broadcasts transactions to other nodes in the network. All the nodes form a network together in consensus. 
A miner does all of this, and more. A miner takes all the transactional data it has received, combines it in a certain way, and hashes it in an attempt to find a new block that the network will accept as valid. Think of it like a guess and check problem: miners must continually try different input values, hoping to obtain an output value that is 'correct' (the output is a basically just a number, and to be correct the number must be low enough). 
Miners that find a new block get rewarded with newly minted coins. Nodes do not get rewarded, the incentive instead is that the user can verify their transactions directly against the network, and help add to network redundancy. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:25:04
I agree with all of that, I think the eventual reality will depend on the technical costs of running a hub though. 
If you are a vendor looking to get paid, you will basically have two options:
- Run a Lightning Node yourself
- Open a channel with an existing hub
(You could do a combination of both as well)
If you run your own hub, customers will need to open channels with you, or be able to find a route through the LN to you. If you open a channel with an existing hub, then you you'll have to find a hub that is willing to lock up funds in a channel with you. 
This represents a risk to the hub, in that they could be using those funds to fund a different channel, with more economic activity. The hub also needs to ensure that your customers also have channels open with them, or at least can route through you. 
So, whatever fees the hub charges the vendor, they need to be less than the costs of running a LN node yourself as a vendor, otherwise why use the hub in the first place?
Back to your original idea: if the hubs exist, then they will need funding. Perhaps small loans will be the way this is secured, but this would also add complexity and cost to the system. Having many small loans means more cost to manage than a single large loan, but if the numbers are right, it is entirely possible. 
Of course, LN hub operators would need to establish themselves as trustworthy, it would be a bit of a gamble lending them your funds :p

'coin data' does not really exist, a 'bitcoin' is really just an 'unspent output' on the blockchain. This record of an unspent output exists in every single full node.
What is important, is the private keys that allow someone to spend bitcoins: owning a private key is akin to owning the bitcoin associated with that private key. 
A hardware wallet securely stores your private keys on the device, so that they are **never** exposed to the internet, and thus protected against many forms of attacks. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:53:23
Yea I hear you, wasn't trying to be on the attack or anything :)
You're right that the internet is much more interwoven, and thus it also has a much higher value than the current bitcoin network. It is also a much older technology, if the internet had been abandoned in the early 90s it probably wouldn't have bothered too many people either. 
I haven't really added a criticism yet, so:
I think govt interference is still a threat on some level. No single govt (or even a group) could truly 'destroy' the network, but if some economically powerful nations ban their citizens from using bitcoin, that would certainly hurt the utility (and price) of the network.

Think about facebook or google, they are worth unbelievable amounts of money, and that is because they collect a huge amount of digital data from their users. As we can see, data is valuable!
Now, consider bitcoin: an invention which allows us to programmatically assign value to data/data flows/etc. It is a system that is borderless and permissionless, so programmers worldwide can work together to create systems that exchange data and value, in ways that were not previously possible. 
So it seems that bitcoin is poised to become very useful to developers, and thus important, and valuable. It is still early days though
@_date: 2019-12-20 03:11:37
A bitcoin is a bitcoin, ‘taint’ is an extrinsic property that has a shaky technical foundation at best once you really get into the nitty gritty of it. For example, did you know that pretty much every single output that exists today can be said to have some level of ‘taint’, relating to thefts from long ago? The meaningfulness of this measure is quite questionable. 
With better transaction crafting, and a social consensus that ‘taint’ is absolute bullshit, bitcoins are fungible. 
It isn’t an easy problem to solve, but the foundation for a fungible currency is there. Engage with products and services that work to enchants fungibility, actively avoid those that work against it. Otherwise, bitcoin could become an Orwellian system of financial control, and that would be a damn shame, of epic proportion.

If you’d like to run a full node, bitcoin-core is the best option, or perhaps btcd. You can run lnd (lightning daemon) on top of it, and then many mobile lightning wallets can run off your lnd instance. 
For mixing, wasabi is a great option. If you are technically inclined, you can even run wasabi with a hardware wallet. (You can also connect a hardware wallet to bitcoin-core via the HWI code, but afaik that’ll take a bit more hacking to get it working right). Note that you can’t coinjoin if the keys are located on a hardware wallet though. 
I’d definitely recommend getting lnd running if you’re interested. It’s early days but the tech works, it’s exciting stuff!

That isn't quite how bitcoin works. The coins do not exist on Coinbase, or on your hard drive. Every node in the entire network has a copy of the blockchain, so a LOT of copies of the record exist (also, they technically do not even exist as 'coins', they exist as 'unspent outputs').
So when you own bitcoins, what you *really* own are the keys that let you spend those 'unspent outputs' that exist on the blockchain. So really, you need to protect those keys very carefully! You can use those keys with any piece of hardware/software you'd like, you can even have a wallet exist on multiple devices at once.  Storing the keys on a hard drive is not best practices, instead you will most likely be asked by your wallet software to store a seed phrase of 12 words. This is something you need to keep **super secret**. Do not store it digitally! Write it down with pen and paper very carefully, and store it somewhere safe. Make a backup, store it in a second, safe location. 
Also, when your coins are on coinbase, they own the keys, so you have to ask Coinbase permission to send your coins anywhere. Coinbase is reputable, so they probably won't steal your money, but most users much prefer to hold their own.

You're right: some coins will eventually become 'lost', as the private keys that control them become lost or unrecoverable for whatever reason. 
Assuming that demand remains constant, a decrease in supply means an increase in price. The exact number of lost coins does not need to be known for this effect to take place, it will manifest in a smaller amount of btc available for trade on the markets.
Rising prices could theoretically go on forever, as a single bitcoin is infinitely divisible (right now, a bitcoin divides to 8 decimal places, but it is possible to increase this if needed). So whether there are 21million bitcoin total, or 1 bitcoin total, it doesn't really matter.

When you say 'send bitcoins to a website', you mean 'send bitcoins to a btc address', right?
If you change one character in an address, your software should detect that the address is incorrect, and not let you send. This can happen because the last few characters in an address are a hash of the rest of the address. If even one character changes then the hash will be entirely different, so the wallet can tell if the address is legit or not.

Transaction throughput increases linearly with increased blocksize, whereas increased adoption will demand an exponential increase. So it is not an efficient way to scale, there are smarter solutions being worked on and deployed. 
As others mentioned, larger block sizes increase centralizing forces. 
There is also an issue of backwards compatibility: increasing the blocksize would have to be done via hardfork, which means every client on the entire network would have to upgrade immediately, or they will end up on a different network. A hard fork is not a trivial undertaking, and it requires near-unanimous agreement from all network users in order to happen cleanly. 
Many developers agree that an increase will happen, but given the above considerations, they will deploy it very carefully.

If the fork happens, you will own coins on both chains, at the addresses you control.
Blockchain.info is taking the stance of *"we'll let the miners decide which coin they like better"*, which many people think is stupid, because it ignores the entire network of user nodes. But that is besides the point for your question. 
It is not 'unsafe' to hold your coins in blockchain.info at the time of the fork, or at least no more 'unsafe' than any other day. The thing is: blockchain.info may only give you access to one of the two chains through their interface, but this just means you will have to use some other software to access the other chain (using the wallet seed you can obtain through the blockchain.info interface). 
Worth noting: without replay protection, it may be difficult to split your coins, which is done by moving them to different addresses that you control on each chain. The safest play at the time of the fork is probably to just chill, HODL, and see how it all plays out before making any moves.

Start a brand new wallet with the ledger. One of the benefits of a hardware wallet is the keys are generated on the device, and never transmitted to your computer. This makes it much, much tougher for a hacker to steal them. 
If you just export your current wallet's seed and plug it into the ledger, then those keys will have existed on whatever online computer you were using before, and thus be more susceptible to attacks. So you would be forgoing one of the main benefits of a hardware wallet!

Does the internet have value? Its just a bunch of 1s and 0s.
In the same way, the bitcoin network can perform a function that otherwise never existed before. As such it is a system that is valuable, even if it is just 1s and 0s. 
That said, you're not wrong that people could lose faith and abandon the project, that is a possibility. But in such a case, it would be for a (hopefully) superior network. You can't un-invent bitcoin, it is a system with useful properties that will live on in one form or another.

The genesis block's coinbase output *could* have been spendable, it is just an artifact of the code that it is not.

If you’re paying ‘50-80x less than usual’, then that almost certainly means that you were using wallet software with TERRIBLE fee rate estimation.

True, there are other cryptocurrency projects that differ from bitcoin in various technical aspects, and as anyone can see looking at the altcoin market, they too have value.
That said, as the tech is built out, I think that *some* altcoins will become irrelevant. As higher level functions of bitcoin come online they will deliver the same advantages and utilities that people valued those altcoins for. 2nd / 3rd layer protocols, side chains, drive chains, blinded bearer certificates... there are lots of ideas about how to increase the functionality of bitcoin.
The most important invention in this space was 'Nakamoto Consensus', the blockchain: a solution to the Byzantine General's problem. While I mean no disrespect to the work of altcoin developers, I don't think any of them have invented something as fundamentally paradigm-shifting as this, instead they have just invented tweaks and improvements, any of which could be adapted by bitcoin. Bitcoin also holds a large first mover advantage, and a reputation that is in line with what defines a solid store of value, so while it is not invincible, it seems to be the 'safest bet' within the industry right now. 
Of course, only time will tell if these techs can be successfully built and deployed!

Right, I understand your comment above better now. Fair enough to call out the argument that "hard fork increase is bad because more data/block", in light of the segwit upgrade that effectively creates more data/block.

To gain $1 in security, we’ll expect miners/validators to spend up to $1 in resources. 
PoW allows a majority of this cost to be spent on a free market resource that is available to all: energy. 
PoS has these same costs, but it obfuscates them away so it naively seems like the ‘greener option’. 
Energy use is not inherently bad, it is just painted so within our current fossil-fuel vs environmentalist paradigm. In fact, PoW incentivizes miners to seek out wasted/cheap electricity, and put it to use. It is a powerful incentive to invest in cheap and renewable energy sources.

No, if two chains form and survive, you will own both.. however it is worth noting that blockchain.info may only allow you to access one or the other through their webwallet.
That said, you have access and control of your private keys and wallet seed with blockchain.info, so if you are unable to access one chain through their service, you can input your wallet seed into some other software that allows access to it.

If you want to continue using bitcoin core, set up a full node, and point your wallet at it. Once you've done that, it won't really matter what coin the miners decide to mine. 
Trying to set up voting for nodes would not be useful: anyone can set up a huge number of nodes on a hosted webservice, swaying the vote. 
Miners are free to signal whatever they want, but if the users don't agree, the users are not forced to follow along with a rule change. By running a node, you can verify that you are still connected to the bitcoin network.

I think bitcoin will keep doing it's thing. If a bunch of miners leave to mine an incompatible coin, thats their choice. It might get bumpy for a short amount of time, but it will be a learning experience that will test the resilience of the system against non-consensus driven changes and attacks. I think bitcoin will survive just fine.

More important than *when* you do it, is how you manage the mixed UTXOs after mixing. If you create a bunch of mixed outputs, then consolidate them all into one payment to send to cold storage... well you probably just undid any gains in anonymity. 
However, If you send straight from exchange to cold storage and then don’t move those coins for a long time, then KYC-connected exchange will probably know that you still own those coins, at least until you move them later in ways that might introduce uncertainty. 
So coinjoining before sending to cold storage would create uncertainty about what you did with your coins. Instead of just knowing that you are still sitting on them... then chain analysis firms won’t know where your coins went (again, this is so long as you practice good post-mix UTXO management!).

Additionally, afaiu poker is difficult to play in a distributed manner: how do you trust that the 'dealer' hasn't rigged the deck? I believe that Bitcoin's mining can provide a solution: a source of some randomness that can be used as a seed to generate poker hands.   
I'm fuzzy on the details of this, but thats the basic explanation as far as I understand it.
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:18:28
Quick explanation:  
The genesis block is hardcoded into the source code, so when a node boots up and starts syncing, it will begin creating the UTXO set at block 1. This means the genesis block (block 0) does not contribute anything to the UTXO set, effectively making the genesis block's coinbase transaction 'not exist' in the view of the network.

That is a naive analysis, and you misunderstood me. I simply meant to point out that there are ways to create channels that are more (or less) useful. Being ‘unbanked’ has nothing to do with it. 
If I only have 10,000 sats, but then open channels with nodes that have a sum total of 100 sats in capacity, I will have opened a somewhat useless channel. Having more money won’t help me, I just need better liquidity in my channel peers.

Nope, hence the name *application specific integrated circuit*. 
The hardware is literally hardwired to accept the expected input (80 byte block header), and then perform the exact mining function as efficiently as possible. This leaves pretty much no room for any sort of generalized computation - you’d need a situation that mimics the mining algorithm exceptionally closely, any deviation will render the hardware obsolete.

The security gains of only ‘spending once’ from an address are somewhat irrelevant though: if the ECDLP is broken so that someone could calculate your priv key from the public key that is revealed during spending, then bitcoin as a whole will be broken, and protecting the funds at one address in particular won’t matter much. The largest reason to avoid address reuse is truly privacy, not security.

Yes, there is a common misconception that 'bitcoin will end banks!', but this is slightly incorrect. Bitcoin will end central banking (monetary policy by fiat), but it will not end retail/commercial banking (there will be institutions that offer bitcoin-related services).  
The interesting thing is that with multisignature constructions, we can actually create entirely new forms of asset custody, so if anything I'd expect to see an expansion of services offered by retail banks.

A Chaumian coinjoin (wasabi, joinmarket, etc) has a distinct fingerprint on the blockchain, so while coordinator address reuse will help point to a transaction being a wasabi coinjoin. Even if the coordinator address changed each mix, it would still be obvious that the transaction is a coinjoin, just from the structure/fingerprint of it (which is part of the public record).   


They apparently had flagged the account, because a previous withdrawal had subsequently participated in a coinjoin. There is nothing about an address that gives information about which wallet it was generated by.  


Chanialysis techniques are ultimately resource-limited, so the common technique is to just send a couple of transactions to yourself, before (/after) participating in a coinjoin. Each extra transaction that chainalysis needs to track is a LOT more resources, so practically they seem to usually just watch a couple of transaction hops, and then thats it. Not a foolproof method, but perhaps enough to evade the automated alarms.   
Really, a better solution is to just avoid any draconian KYCd exchange.

You misunderstand me: ‘payjoin’ is the technique I’m talking about, it is a more advanced version of coinjoin that doesn’t depend on equal value outputs to obfuscate the history of an output. Recent advancements such as BIP174 PSBT have built the foundation for this sort of tech, I expect we’ll see it roll out in the next year or two.

There has been one example of being flagged that I’ve seen. Generally I would recommend avoiding any exchange that imposes such rules, it’s extremely anti-privacy. The justification is simple: you’d like financial privacy against those you transact with. Eg, The shop you spend ~$20 worth of bitcoin with doesn’t need to gain info about your cold storage holdings, that represents a large risk to you as a user. 
Exchanges/chainalysis will follow a couple of transaction hops, for coins that go in/out of their system. Each additional tx they must follow is a lot of resources, so there is a practical limit to what they have the resources for. If you’d like to use coinjoin and are worried about them questioning you, then you could try just sending a few txs before/after the coinjoin, and chances are you won’t have issue then. 
Privacy is very important, without it we lose fungibility, and bitcoin becomes much, much less valuable. Work to preserve privacy and everyone benefits. Bend to the over reaching KYC rules and we all suffer.

It is simple to write the code, but extremely difficult to deploy it, and that is the point! Code does not exist in a vacuum, this system is intricately tied to the humans that perceive it to be valuable.    
All nodes need to upgrade, not just mining (unless the miners want to start building a chain that the rest of the network ignores). If you'd like to argue that 'non-mining nodes aren't relevant', I'm going to heartily disagree (and history helps to show this). Other cryptocurrencies hardfork easily because they don't have as distributed a network. If the same was true for Bitcoin, then the '2x upgrade' would have happened. That was the culmination of many years of 'scaling debate': it was shown that miners/businesses cannot force a change through, without having users (nodes) on board as well.   
Bcash did hardfork a larger block size, and hypothetically, if the BTC network had all migrated to that chain at that time, then we would now say that 'Bitcoin hardforked to increase the block size'. But clearly, the market also concluded that the Bcash network was not the preferred route forward, and so I'm not sure what the point you're trying to make is. That Bitcoin users are dumb for not hardforking?
@_date: 2019-12-21 02:30:24
If you use a chaumian coinjoin (eg wasabi/joinmarket) effectively, your post-mix UTXOs will have an indiscernible history. Chainalysis companies can only track post-mix coins that are handled poorly by the user.  
eg) you buy coins from a KYC'd exchange, send them to wasabi, mix them, and then spend the mixed coins in a transaction that includes unmixed (KYC'd coins). Any privacy gained through wasabi is destroyed, as far as the KYC'd exchange can see.

Maybe? 
- You send your bitcoin to a multisig address that you and the hub control keys to.
- Now that bitcoin must be sent in another transaction, one to lock the bitcoin and open a LN channel. This step would involve spending the coins stored in the multi-sig address, thus removing your control.
- You send your bitcoin to a multisig address that you and the hub control keys to. This transaction is actually the opening of a channel with one of their clients, so essentially *you* are the counterparty in the channel, and the hub just did the service of hooking you up with the client. 
I think that a hub which raises it's own funds would potentially be more reliable, in that channels wouldn't be closed at the will of the lenders.

And that all assumes the user is interacting with some KYCd exchange/whatever. If they never do, then using a privacy enhancing tool like wasabi is important so they’re not broadcasting their financial history to everyone they deal with. 
In any case, if BIP174 becomes widely adopted then we’ll likely see all sorts of coin-join style transactions become more normative.

Double spend attacks would hurt the network, that is almost certain, but it is important to understand the *way* in which it hurts the network. Double spend attacks are a very different sort of thing than being able to arbitrarily create coins. Yea, from the attacker's perspective they have 'free money' in some sense, but on the technical network level, that is not a good description of what is happening. 
For this reasons I don't think it is just semantics, there is a technical difference that is important. Saying you have 'an infinite amount of coins' is a mis-statement of the consequence of a 51% attack. Understanding these sort of attack vectors is important in designing the network to be resilient against them. 
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:31:41
Yea, anyone listening to your network traffic (eg your ISP) will know that you’re running a node during the clearnet sync, so if you later switch to tor routing, they may be able to infer you are still running a node. Think about this this way: they can see you communicating with the BTC network, and then at some point, you stop, but now you send a similar amount of data in/out of the tor network. It suddenly is much less of a mystery what you’re using the tor network for..
Running the sync over tor is a solution to this problem, as is performing the IBD/sync at a different, unrelated IP address. I’ve heard some people even recommend downloading a lot of additional ‘junk data’ over tor during the IBD/sync, so that the fact you’re syncing a node over tor isn’t obvious just from the volume of data you’re sending in/out of the tor network.

An address should be used to receive coins only once, so any good wallet will show you a new receiving address after every transaction received. 
Coinbase is custodial, so you don’t control the keys to your coins. This means you just have an account that coinbase has to credit once your deposit clears their stipulations. I would absolutely recommend finding a different, non custodial wallet. Bitcoin.org has a good page of recommendations for wallets you could look at.
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:47:51
The goal is user privacy and coin fungibility, not hiding illicit funds from authorities. With a tool like wasabi, users can gain privacy in a way that allows them to selectively reveal their transaction history, rather than having it publicly available. 
This means that every person you engage in transactions with won’t be able to discern your financial history/holdings, but it still allows you to provide a history if needed. 
Hopefully in the future, coinjoin style transactions (Chaumian joins like wasabi uses, P2EP, etc) will become more common so they are less ‘high profile’.

Anyone can timestamp a document (or whatever) if they’d like, it doesn’t depend on some centralized service.

Mining ASICs are built to do one thing and one thing only: SHA256 hashes. They are literally hardwired for do this, it isn’t possible to do general computation on them. 
Scanning addresses for balances is an entirely different computation, that involves randomly generating a private key, using ECDSA to compute the public key, and then hashing and finally encoding that pubkey to create a bitcoin address. For P2SH addresses, you would also need knowledge of the script itself!
So there is absolutely no way to use a SHA256 miner to scam addresses. It would be like trying to use your toaster to generate private keys- not going to happen. Your worry is unwarranted :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:37:43
Check the timestamp on the block before it: 15 seconds prior. 
This block was likely found before the miner could fully validate the previous block, so including transactions could lead to an invalid block, since the miner wasn't 100% sure of what was included in the prior block yet. 
So, better to go with 0 tx and secure the block fee asap!
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:56:35
Not quite. If you send the 100 coins, and then use your hashpower to re-mine that block to remove the transaction from the block chain, then the end result is that the address you sent them to will have a zero balance on the chain you re-mined. So you can do it ten times, but you will still have 100 coins total. 
An unspent output is not just a single entry of 'there are 100 coins here', so you cannot game the network in this way. An unspent output is a cryptographic trail that links those coins all the way back to the block(s) they were minted in. The system is built so it is easy to verify this trail, and see that coins are legit. A break in this cryptographic proof means the other network participants will ignore your transactions. 
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:07:23
That is not true, and in any case an election with some physical-world result doesn’t need to be ‘decentralized and trustless’.  This is because whoever is implementing the election needs to be trusted in any case. If they implement a ‘trustless’ system but then decide to not follow it’s results, then the level of trust needed to interact with the system is irrelevant. 
So if you need to trust the individuals that are organizing the election as a base point, then you might as well trust them to run the accounting system as well, and take advantage of more efficient systems and structures.

Using Monero can help with this, as can using coinjoin techniques properly. Right now the cultural norm is to expect some level of surveillance, at least in most nations with a developed banking system.
The next generation of coinjoin tech (P2EP, etc) is designed to leave no obvious fingerprint on the blockchain, it will hopefully be built right into end-user wallets such that users won’t have to know anything about coinjoin to benefit from using it. Lightning network transactions also provide great anonymity, the future is really not too bleak. 
Nothing is perfect, monero has issues as well, privacy will be an ongoing battle. We have a similar goal, no sense in attacking each other here.

Opendimes are not explicitly designed for long term storage. Electronic components can and will degrade over time, so if you plug your opendime in 10 years from now, it might not work. This is a danger of using them to store coins for an extended period of time.   
The opendime is a really cool device, but its important to understand the limitations of it so that you can keep your BTC safe.

I agree in principle... creating a more level playing field for all miners is what will promote decentralization of mining. For that to work, this sort of service would need to be easily available to *all* miners though, and considering the capital they'll invest to develop this system, I'm not sure that will be the case. If it ends up being a system that is only viable for large scale miners with capital to invest into their operation, then it may actually promote centralization.


Yea, I don't think patents that give specific network participants an economic advantage are conducive to the long-term health of the network.

@_date: 2017-04-22 11:44:11
No, there is a subtle difference. If you own 100 coins before taking 51% control of the network, then you could spend those 100 coins, receive goods in return for them, and then re-mine the blocks, starting with the one that your transaction was included in, and remove that transaction from existence. Since you control more hashpower than the rest of the network, you'll be able to catch back up from behind, and still have the longest chain (with your 100 coins ready to spend again). 
If you tried to forge a transaction for 1000 coins, then the network would require cryptographic proof of an unspent output for 1000 coins (which you don't have, since you only own 100). Being able to mine faster than the rest of the network doesn't mean you'll be able to fake the crypto to prove coin ownership, doing so would break consensus and the rest of the network would ignore your transactions. 
In other words, having 51% of hashpower doesn't mean you get to decide the rules of the network. You can just game the system to spend your coins more than once. 
Does that make more sense?

The difference is in the ability to access the private key. If someone hands you a paper wallet, they may have a backup of the private key, so you need to move those coins to an address you control, in case they move the coins to an address only they control after giving you the wallet. 
This device holds the private key until the tab is broken, so you can be sure someone won't rip you off in this way. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:36:32
This would require the device to have access to internet though. Giving it that access would be a big (expensive) hardware upgrade (more processing power, a screen, a wifi terminal, etc). It would kind of defeat the purpose of it, though I do agree with you it would be nice to have a way to check the balance and authenticity on the fly.

Quantum entanglement does not allow information transfer faster than the speed of light, though this is a common misunderstanding. Although quantum states can hypothetically be entangled over large distances, meta-information about a change of quantum state must still be transmitted separately, and thus is still limited by c. 
An interplanetary bitcoin may be functional through the use of payment channels, however the opening/closing of channels and finality of payments would have additional timing considerations related to the user’s light-distance from the majority of hashing power.

Changes to the code are discussed and reviewed extensively, in public channels for anyone to see. Places to watch this process unfold (or, take part if you are a dev) include the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the  IRC channel, and of course the bitcoin-core github repository. 
Updates to the codebase are not pushed out to network nodes automatically. Each node operator must choose to update their node to any new code, and the network’s rules are defined by the consensus rules enforced by all of the nodes. 
So a developer cannot push some change out, against the will of the users. In fact, it is extremely difficult to enact any change to the consensus rules (see: the segwit2x debacle from 2017). The network is defined by the users up, not from some administrators down.

This is slightly incorrect: a **bip 39 seed phrase** can be used to derive multiple receiving addresses, but each address will have it’s own private key (all managed by the software, so you just have to save the seed phrase). 
That said, a private key can be used to derive two different addresses: one from the compressed public key, and one from the uncompressed public key. But afaik most wallet software will just utilize one of those two derivation schemes, so that’s more of a fun fact than the way things actually work.

In many jurisdictions, offering unregistered securities is illegal. I want to clarify that I am not someone that thinks 'Bitcoin needs regulation', far from it. But if you are a company offering a security token, then you will be subject to the rules of your jurisdiction, and so the buyers of those tokens take on the risk of the company being shut down by local authorities, etc. 
Plus, there is no way to trustlessly program bitcoin transactions to only send to the address specified by the owner of a security token. So as the owner of a token, you must trust that the company that issued it will make good on the dividend payment, so the advantage of issuing the security as a cryptocurrency token remains slightly unclear in this regard.


Honestly, there are a number of reasons:
* It looks quite amateur, the demo page and MVP are both poor examples of a product (eg. you can apparently view the content 'for free' on the MVP page, by subscribing and then unsubscribing).
* I would have to trust that the company pays me dividends accordingly, and I see no reason to trust them as such.
* I have seen other, already more developed open source alternatives being built, that can be used for free. So I think a service with fees may have a harder time competing in the future (although ease-of-use is a factor that will attract users, regardless of fees, so this is not absolute)
* But perhaps the biggest reason: This project is attempting to use OP\_RETURN to publish content from users to the blockchain, which tells me they do not have a well-developed understanding of bitcoin development/functionality. So my confidence that they'll get the rest right isn't huge.

The goal of this doesn't concern whether a bitcoin is 'dirty' or not, it concerns the very important privacy of all bitcoin users. If privacy does not exist for users, then Bitcoin could become an unbelievably Orwellian system of surveillance, and ultimately if fungibility is destroyed, then so is Bitcoin's utility as a form of money.
If we come to believe that some bitcoins are 'dirty', and others are 'clean', then we will have created a very bad and broken system. By building transactions in a way that obfuscates a UTXO's history, we will preserve the ever-important privacy of users, and fungibility of Bitcoin. Anything else is not a good outcome.

'Consensus' is a tricky word here, because it is almost impossible to measure in a way that is relevant to the function of the network. I think we are much more likely to see similar increases through soft-fork mechanisms than a naïve 'block size increase'.   
I put this in quotations because Segwit was such an optimization, through an increase in block weight. Nodes that are aware of the segwit upgrade are processing &gt;1mB of data per block, and this was accomplished without a hardforking rule change.   
Short of absolute crisis (ie, network halting/destroying bugs), I do not reasonably see the Bitcoin network reaching the level of consensus required for a hard fork change. 'Blocking further adoption' is a subjective measure that I don't believe will ever reach such a consensus. You say 'blocking further development', others say 'running fine at the limit of what allows us to remain in distributed consensus'.   
This is, as they say, a feature. Not a bug.

I don't understand, why would you write the content into OP\_RETURN?   
Offering bitcoin patronage is one thing, trying to build an un-censorable platform is another thing entirely. What data are you going to write into OP\_RETURN, and how will it help content creators avoid censorship?
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:33:31
OP\_RETURN allows a user to encode up to 80 bytes of data into a UTXO.   
So the answer is: quite expensive. Using a blockchain to store data is maybe one of the most expensive ways to do it, their website mentions 'accounting for this cost in the fees to use the service', which is just to say 'the customer pays indirectly'.

True, the Bitcoin blockchain is reasonably immutable.


Sure, I don't see why not. It is a tall order to create un-censorable platforms, but I am happy to see people trying.


This is a very expensive and inefficient way to store content. OP\_RETURN allows just 80 bytes to be stored, any meaningful amount of data would take a fair amount of BTC worth of tx fees to encode into the blockchain. Photos/videos are well beyond this data limit, and for text, why not use a solution like email? The content creator could share content with patrons via email, which allows delivery basically free of charge, and is also basically un-censorable.
Or, hosting content on something like bittorrent could even be preferable. Bittorrent is a protocol which has proven itself very difficult to censor. You could share encrypted data via bittorrent, and patrons could be given the decryption key to view it.
Those are just a couple of quick ideas, that I think would work much better than paying tx fees to publish data using OP\_RETURN. The bitcoin network does not seem to be well-suited to creating a censorship resistant content-sharing platform. Think about the scaling debate that has taken place over the last couple of years... now imagine trying to stuff photos or videos into transactions. Not a good plan.

If you prune the data, you obviously won’t be able to serve it to a peer later. If your node has good uptime, otherwise fully archived, etc, then it’ll likely be used by others to request the data you haven’t pruned. 
You may consider it spam, but as long as someone is paying the tx fee to have their OP_RETURN output added to the chain, it will be added to the chain. One 80 byte OP_RETURN blob of data at a time.

@_date: 2019-01-10 13:56:21
Running a pruned node has no affect on new nodes. They simply download the data from a different peer. 
It is possible to change the bitcoin protocol to do just about anything (including the removal of OP_RETURN), but of course you would have to convince the majority of users (nodes) to follow along with your changes. So until you are able to do that, you will not be able to change the rules.

No one. Bitcoin is run and backed by open source protocols and software, it doesn't need a central entity to back it. The idea that this is a good thing/bad thing represents two very different paradigms of thought. 
Within the central banking/fiat paradigm, as a participant of the system, you **NEED** to trust the system will not fail, and thus the fed works to 'uphold the value of the dollar'.
Within the bitcoin paradigm, you **DO NOT NEED** to trust *anyone* in order to participate in the system. If you hold the keys to the coins, then they are yours, and yours alone to spend. 
So there is no central guarantee in bitcoin's value. In fact, *the lack of a need for one* is seen by many as a strength, even if there is a possibility of the value plummeting. Some people even place value in this fact, believing that in the long term, the free market will do a better job finding economic balance than the fed's regulation can.

When the network is 'used correctly', each bitcoin address is only used once: one funding tx, one spending tx. This is important for pseudonymity: anyone trying to match an identity to coins as they move through the system will have to make guesses as to which part of the spent tx is the payment, and which part is the return change.
So for a govt to properly audit their citizen's use of a system, they would need to know **all** of the public keys associated with each citizen. Something like this could be mandated by law, but it would likely be difficult to perfectly enforce. For example, what is to stop someone from just not registering some of their addresses?

In order to make a chain with a higher POW, you would need more mining power than the rest of the network. This is basically a '51% mining attack', a lot has been written on this in the past, if you search some forums you'll find lots of useful info. 
Without a majority of the hashpower, mining your own chain in private would be a waste of electricity, since the public chain will have more POW securing it. 


I think this would break the incentives that help keep the chain in consensus. If *"number of txs"* weighs into the calculation of the longest valid chain, then any miner that finds a block will want to ensure that block is **entirely** full, or else that block may get orphaned by another miner that creates an entirely full block. Any less-than-full block could cause a network fork. 
As a proposed 'fix' for a 51% attack this also falls short. An attacking miner could easily fill all of their privately mined blocks with meaningless txs, at no additional cost.

[Check out this video,]( Andreas always does a great job of explaining how Bitcoin works. That video is from a few years ago, if you search Youtube you'll find a ton more from him. 
Check out some of the links in the sidebar, ask questions, and enjoy the ride :)

The premise is dumb: unless a satoshi is worth a tangible amount, bitcoin isn't useful? 


If you have a gold bar, and want an item that costs one gold bar, then of course you'd trade it! This article is full of poorly written lols.

Weak point: using the scanner/printer to make a copy of the list. Why not just write one out by hand again? If you can do it well enough once, then you can copy it once more than that. Double, triple check, and you'll have removed a liability from the equation (the printer). How do you know the scanner doesn't store images locally persistently? Same with the printer. What if someone later connects it to an online computer or network? You could destroy it, but that seems like a lot of work compared to just copying it once more. 
Also, What about the password to keepass? I can see that being a weak point. If you're in an accident or something happens so that you cannot decrypt your keepass, would it be an issue? How long would it take to brute force the 24-word randomised list? 
Otherwise, this is an interesting approach. I like that gaining control of the steel plate doesn't give immediate access to the wallet, so you potentially have time to react. Perhaps more of a worry would be if someone accessed your keepass, since you may not be alerted as easily or quickly as if someone breaks into your home/safe. It would be best to name the keepass entry something unrelated, so that it would not become apparent to the hacker that they had found a btc wallet seed cypher. If they knew that, they may target you/your safe! But that is quite the scenario, I think your btc are quite safe compared to most!

Fair enough, in the context of the OP it makes more sense. I don't think it would create a *true* competitor though, the things that make bitcoin great depend on the lack of need for trusted third parties. What your comment described sounds more like Paypal 2.0.

Your bch coins are safe, they implemented replay protection so a tx that spends them will not be valid on btc or btc2x chains, and vice versa. 
When splitting btc / bch coins, you'll probably want to send your btc to a new address first, and *then* import the wallets seed into some bch software so they can also be sent to a new address. 
(I'd recommend this order of operation, since the btc wallet software you use is probably more well-used/vetted than the bch wallet software, so on the off-chance you end up with some malicious bch software that attempts to steal any btc associated with your wallet seed, you'll be safe because the btc that were in the wallet have already been spent to an address you control.)
Otherwise, without replay protection btc and btc2x transactions may end up on the wrong chain, so you'll have to be careful making transactions if there is there is any uncertainty in the network. 
So, with all of that in mind: if you are worried about transacting with your bch right around the time of the S2X split, then I would split the coins into their own wallets / addresses now.

This is a fair point, but honestly I find it slightly incredulous that such weight is being given to 'businesses not wavering on an agreement' in this debate. 
Upgrade the protocol by debating the merits of each proposition, don't do it because some businesses met in private to decide on the future of the system we all use! If someone honours 'their word' in a situation like that, more than the technical critiques of computer scientists, then I think it is obvious they deserve no say in the way the protocol is upgraded. 
TL;DR: who cares if the agreement is broken, an agreement of this sort isn't the best way to upgrade the network protocol in the first place!

You control your priv keys with bread, which is good.
Since it is an SPV wallet, it will communicate with a node in the bitcoin network to send / receive data. The software will automatically connect to a node, but you can now specify which node you are connected to in the bread settings. Select a node that runs 0.15.x and you'll stay connected to the btc chain. Select a node that runs btc1/2x, and you'll connect to the 2x chain.

If a buyer owns and wants to spend bitcoin on an item in your marketplace, then it'll prob be very cheap and fast to complete the transaction. 
Having the buyer buy in/out of btc to complete the transaction will not be cheap though, as exchange websites/brokers will have their own fees to add to the mix. 
The btc network works well, but there is friction where it meets traditional banking systems.

Blocks are one thing, but disconnecting entirely will also help mitigate against replay attacks, since txs that are potentially valid on both chains could be cross-relayed otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:38:28
Ah, I understand your proposal better now:
Set block size= 1MB + n*100kb
n = (avg fees + rewards, last 2016 blocks) / 25. 
[n must be rounded down to the next integer]
So then, how does a programmer decide when the fees are 'too high!', and thus set the limit for an increase to happen? 
Also, if the fees increased 5x, the block size would only increase 0.5x, so this does not seem to be an effective solution. Consider that the periods of mempool congestion seem to happen over the course of hours, or perhaps days.

A hardware wallet can generate new addresses for every transaction you receive. Otherwise, reusing the same offline address can sacrifice your privacy. 
If I pay you more than once, and notice you transfer the payment to the same address both times after receiving it, then I could guess that to be a storage address of yours, and I could see the balance of it.

Backwards compatibility has special considerations in a consensus network like bitcoin. To put it simply:
- To be a part of the network, you must follow the rules.
So then, how do we change the rules? 
- If we want to change the rules to make it so that something that was allowed before is no longer allowed, then we have a 'soft fork' that is backwards compatible. Think about it: the older nodes will still validate everything the newer nodes do, since they're still operating within 'the rules' (even though the new rules are more strict).
- If we want to change the rules, so that something that was not allowed before is suddenly allowed, then we have a 'hard fork', and lose backwards compatibility. Think about it: the old nodes will reject everything the new nodes do, since they are doing something that the old nodes know is 'not allowed'. 
This is important, it is not some design oversight. It is one of the things that makes bitcoin resistant to malicious actors attempting to take control of the network. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:27:45
You're safe, the recent network upgrades are 100% backwards compatible. Also, BCash implemented replay protection, so you don't have to worry about the fork causing any issues (though if you held coins in an address on or before the Aug 1 fork, you'll now have an equivalent amount of BCH sitting in those addresses, so make sure you hang onto your private keys, they will allow you to recover/spend/trade your BCH in the future).

The part I've put in bold is incorrect: when Alice opens a payment channel, she sends some amount of btc into a multisig address, which is an on-chain tx, so the network will not allow those coins to later be double-spent. 
Once the channel is open, Alice &amp; Bob can exchange signed txs between eachother at their leisure. I wouldn't call this 'off chain' though, because the txs are different in nature than those of a typical service that utilizes offchain txs (like a btc exchange, the old reddit tipbot, etc). The txs Alice &amp; Bob exchange are more like 'on-chain-if-either-participant-feels-like-it' txs. 
Any of the txs Alice and Bob exchange could be published to the network at any time if they so desire. Doing so would close the channel and divide up the btc locked into it. The same couldn't be said of other offchain txs, for example you could not take the internal bookkeeping of a bitcoin exchange and publish that data to the bitcoin network to initiate or settle an on-chain tx.

1 MB + 100kb = 1.1 MB. So it would take just 2,016 blocks to raise the limit to 1.1MB, or 20,160 blocks to raise it to 2MB. 
I think your numbers are off: 30,000 / 2016 = 14.88 btc worth of fees per block? 
As I understood your original post, if the f+r is higher than the last 2016 blocks, then an increase is implemented (and vice versa). Is that incorrect?

A convenient rebranding of the word 'node' doesn't change the fact that those who fully participate in the network by running a real full node will laughingly reject the 2X blocks. The SPV wallets Mike describes are going to have a bumpy ride, funny how the manner in which they plan to take control involves a lot of uncertainty and turmoil for the SPV users.

Reusing an old offline address can sacrifice your privacy. If I pay you more than once, and notice you transfer the payment to the same address both times after receiving it, then I could guess that to be a storage address of yours, and I could see the balance of it. 
In contrast, an address generated on an online computer could be at risk of having a malicious attacker steal the keys. 
Using an offline computer to generate private keys for each new transaction is the way to go for very secure storage. Hardware wallets are popular solutions to this.

This is likely true for a lot of people, with a few traces of ID, a motivated person could likely connect the dots between many different txs and addresses. Also important to keep in mind: it isn't just govts working to link addresses to identities, a database like that would be worth a lot of money. I would assume there are probably multiple parties out there quietly working on this.


The issue is: if the system is built in a way which allows taxation, then it is only a matter of time before a less benevolent govt takes advantage of their people. This is one of the reasons that efforts to build systems which remove the obfuscation of btc ownership are met with efforts to further anonymize txs. Fungibility is important, but it goes further than that, for the network to meet its full potential, it needs to maintain secure anonymity for its users.

Bitcoin allows us to add value to data, digital products, and transactions, in ways that did not exist before. I think your worry is justified, as smartphones are digitizing more and more of the average person's everyday experience, and so it seems that bitcoin may be a means of monetizing that data. 
I can think of an analogy: gunpowder. The invention of it allows us to do some really neat stuff, like make pretty fireworks. It also allows us to make guns and ammunition, which can kill people. 
So the application of this gunpowder technology can go two ways: something beautiful, or something scary. Different cultures embrace each outcome differently: some countries ban personal firearms outright, while in other countries it is almost the norm for everyone to carry a gun.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, that I think you are right. We must be prudent in our application of this technology, so as not to shift the human experience to a calculated exchange of data and value. 
On this point, somewhat anecdotally, I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the over-use of cellphones in social situations. However, this doesn't change the fact that on average, people are spending more time interacting with their phone than they were years ago. I don't have specific numbers, but I think it goes without saying that 10-15 years ago, people used phones less than now. 
So the worry becomes: does the potential to make money off these interactions create an incentive to do so, that trumps the social stigmas of cell phone use?

Once you broadcast a transaction, nodes all around the world will store it in their mempool, until a miner adds it to a block. Because you could never *guarantee* that a transaction had been removed from every node, it is impossible to 'take it back' after it has been broadcast. 
That said, after a certain amount of time, most nodes will drop unconfirmed transactions (so that they don't get bloated with low-fee txs that won't confirm). You can also use something like replace by fee (RBF) if the wallet is set up for it, or child pays for parent (CPFP). Google search those terms to learn more about them.

If you used an older wallet, then you may need to find out what derivation path it used, and then recover the wallet using software that allows you to specify a derivation path. 
Your seed phrase is used to derive keys. The notation for a certain derivation path looks something like this: m/0’/0’/0/1. 
m: master key, and then each number past that represents one deeper level of derivation. The apostrophe means that key is ‘hardened’, meaning it is derived using a slightly different derivation scheme to allow for better security. 
There are a few different standards of derivation path that can be used to create a wallet, so you just need to tell your wallet which path to use. There are infinite paths and keys you could generate, so your wallet needs this info in order to derive the right keys and allow you to spend your funds.

The consensus rules right now require a hard fork to change the block size. This is because a hard for is required when you're changing the code to allow something that wasn't allowed before. 
If you hardfork and change the rules to allow block size changes, then you wouldn't need another hard fork to perform those block size changes.

No, a mnemonic seed phrase is designed to be a secure, human-readable method of backup, not a way to initiate transactions. Sending the mnemonic to a server is basically giving away full control of your coins to that server, I doubt any such API exists. If it does exist, I wouldn’t trust it.

A blockchain is inherently more resource intensive to run than a centralized database, that should always hold true. So there must be a property of blockchains that makes them worth the extra resources, a property that a centralized database does not have.
The answer is the **ability of the user to participate without permission, and without having to trust anyone else**. Both of these are a big deal, being trust-less removes the ability of an administrator (or hacker controlling admin accounts) to change the records for whatever reason. As a user, you don't have to rely on anyone else to participate in the system. 


This is a good point, if only insofar as it is a common reaction to the finality of transactions on the network. My response is this: I think that the user-facing applications running on the network will continue to evolve in a way that makes for a better user experience. The base layer of bitcoin is technical and scary to use, it should be obvious that the average person will not be willing to jump into it. However, using higher level applications on the network we can build financial tools which are much more user friendly, and perhaps mimic the functionality of the current financial system to some extent.
That said, the really exciting thing is that the network allows us to build tools that were previously impossible to create. I think it is a misconception that bitcoin will simply replace the current financial world. The current world has been built to be as efficient as it can be, I don't think a decentralized system is poised to replace it. Perhaps it will eat a small chunk of the old system up, but more interesting is the whole *new* set of financial tools we can build, that were otherwise not possible before.

I think you overestimate how much the average person cares about privacy in this way, I think only the small percentage of people who get badly burned (eg like in cases of identity theft in the prevailing financial system) really step up and look for solutions. Not to say they shouldn't care more, of course, but most people just want something simple and easy to use. So really, I think much of this falls onto the backs of developers and businesses, to create systems and services that help preserve privacy.   
I do think Monero is interesting as an experiment in privacy tech, but as solutions like Liquid become more accessible, I think they will be even more useful than Monero (much better scalability). Different trade-offs (federated vs run-your-own-node), but perhaps still acceptable for many use-cases.

If you hold coins before a fork, you'll hold coins on both resulting chains. The same goes for the fork of a fork, etc. 
It is tough to say what the tech will look like 10 years from now. There isn't currently any way to know about forks from within the protocol (your node will only talk to the network it is in consensus with), so you'd likely have to check some community hubs online to learn of any such happenings.

It is not only criminals that would be protected, this is an erroneous line of thinking. 
1. I do an OTC trade with a criminal, buying btc that they gained from a ‘flagged, illegal transaction’. Next, I spend that BTC at a local business, that uses an AML-hooked-up service to process txs. Oops! That btc is now locked, and the local business had no idea anything illegal was happening. This is VERY BAD for the utility of btc. 
2. I am a criminal, and I own some coins flagged by an AML service. I want to cause problems for someone I know (maybe I’m a disgruntled employee, or have it out for someone I know, or I just want to troll), so I search out a bitcoin address I know is controlled by them, and I send a small amount of btc to it (could be just a penny worth, or less). Now if they spend coins from the wallet that controls that address, it may consume the UTXO created when I sent tainted coins, and thus their new output will be tainted as well! Uh oh, now they’re in trouble, and they could do nothing to prevent this otherwise!
The list could go on. Fungibility is important! Any service that attempts to degrade this is seriously detrimental to the network, and should be regarded as an attack on the sovereignty of end users.

And what do you propose happens after the ASICs are all ‘bricked’?
There is no ‘ASIC-proof’ POW, many altcoins that’s have tried it end up with someone secretly manufacturing an ASIC, and owning their network even more completely. 
A business like bitmain that has money and experience manufacturing ASICs will likely have a huge advantage if the race for a newASIC starts over. 
What is really needed is just more manufacturers in the ASIC space. Now that SHA256 ASICs are at the state of the art for manufacturing (transistor size, etc), bitmain’s advantage will (hopefully) be slowly diminished.

To clarify: Importing private keys doesn't 'move' coins, it just allows an additional wallet to spend the coins. Many wallets will have a 'sweep private keys' feature, which basically imports the private keys, and then spends the coins to a new address, so that the new wallet is in full control of the funds. In most situations, this is what you'll want to do (if not just spending coins the normal tx way).

Like you suggested, people using bitcoin may disrupt the ability of govts to collect some forms of taxation. 
However, bitcoin may also allow govts to reliably collected new forms of taxation, perhaps by regulating and taxing certain businesses operating in the bitcoin space. 
I'm not talking about red-tape and regulation being thrown at startups, instead consider that larger corporations will have a harder time obfuscating their revenue and profits like they do in the current system using shell companies and offshore banking. The more bitcoin is integrated, the harder these sort of actions may become.
Taxation is not *truly* a zero-sum game, but nonetheless perhaps this loss/gain could even itself out, in a total tax revenue sense.

Anyone can generate private keys endlessly, so it isn't really correct to say when you buy bitcoin you 'buy a private key'. When you buy bitcoin, the seller will send it to an address that you happen to control the private key for, but it isn't as if you bought the private key from them (unless they traded an opemdime stick to you I guess? but anyways..)
Ask the noob: "Where does a website exist? Does it have value?"
It is sort of analogous: a website exists within the www network. A bitcoin exists within the btc network. A website is hosted on a server, and then hopefully backed up on some other servers. Bitcoin is hosted on nodes that are kinda like 'blockchain servers', and there are a lot of them. Each node has a copy of all the transactions ever, which is used to make sure no one is cheating the network. 
You could explain how some digital things like an mp3 file have value, but can be copied endlessly. Obviously if someone could just copy their bitcoin file and spend each copy endlessly that would be bad! One of the achievements of bitcoin's design was a way to use some fancy cryptography to prevent people from doing this. 
What this means is: when you buy bitcoin, the rest of the computers in the network all know and agree that some unspent coins ("unspent outputs") exists at an address that you control.

Additionally, afaik light wallets have no way of verifying the fee rates being presented to them, other than querying several nodes and hoping the nodes aren't colluding. So if a miner ran an 'SPV' style wallet service, they could easily present their wallet clients with inflated fee rates.

If a past fork was based upon the bitcoin genesis block, then all btc holders would receive the forkcoin as well. 
If a past fork was based on the code but not the genesis block (eg litecoin), then btc holders would not receive any forkcoin.

Did you write down the 12-word passphrase when you started up the app? That is REALLY important. Use a pen and paper, store it somewhere super duper safe. DO NOT store it on a computer in any way!

Benefit of running a node is not just ‘personal satisfaction’, it is financial sovereignty. You no longer have to trust anyone else to hold and spend value, you can simply verify the state of the system for yourself!
A healthy node count helps ensure antifragility, but we don’t have to depend on an altruistic “I’m doing it for the network” sort of user to maintain this. Motivated users benefit themselves by running a node.

He means that ideas of digitizing cash transactions is an idea older than bitcoin, and that the earliest ideas involved using fiat as a backing for the tx.

It depends how you use Bitcoin. If you use KYCd exchanges to buy coins, and then have poor UTXO management skills when sending on-chain transactions, then it isn’t too hard to track you. Add the use of poorly architected lite wallets, and online block explorers to look up your own transactions... and suddenly Bitcoin can become quite Orwellian if you’re not careful. 
However, if you are more careful and knowledgeable, and use infrastructure that helps enable and preserve fungibility and anonymity, then it becomes very difficult to track you and your coins. 
For example, no government will be able to easily discern lightning network spending habits, the sort of assumptions that often work for on-chain analysis fail miserably when you encounter a LN UTXO. 
Similarly, UTXOs that are peg-ins for sidechains like liquid are very difficult to analyze, and the liquid chain utilities confidential transaction tech, so following the trail there is futile (similar to how it is futile in Monero). 
Most people likely just use the sort of privacy-hurting techs I described above, so the problem is there. But as the technology advances, I hope we’ll see more privacy-preserving tools and architectures continue to develop and be widely utilized. It’s very important we don’t end up in a terrible Orwellian future of fully surveilled financial systems :(

Just remember: if you do import the private key to a softwarewallet, and then send the funds to a different paper wallet, **make sure you send ALL of the funds**. Anything you do not send will no longer exist at the address listed on the original paper wallet, instead it will have been transferred to a change address kept by the wallet software. 
In other words, remember each paper wallet is a 'one time spend'. I can remember reading a couple stories from people that forgot this, transferred half the value, and then deleted the software wallet. Woops.. cya later, bitcoins.

You can move your coins now, and safely split the BCH out, no problems there. The BCH coins already exist ('have been split'), blockchain.info just hasn't added the code to recover them from within their web wallet yet. So instead, we'll use some other tools to do so!
Your password is not your private key. If you sign in to your blockchain.info wallet, you can go into the settings and view your 12-word seed, as well as the public/private keys for all addresses associated with your wallet. Don't worry about the private keys, all you are going to need is that 12-word phrase. 
To claim your BCH:
- Send ALL of the BTC that are in your blockchain.info wallet to a new wallet of your choosing
- **Once that BTC transaction is properly confirmed**, download a BCH wallet. There may be more options now, but I used 'electron cash' a few weeks ago and it worked well. Do this on a machine that isn't compromised with any sort of malware, if possible. 
- Open the BCH software and select the option to recover a wallet from a 12-word seed. This is where you'll input your blockchain.info 12-word seed. 
- If all goes well, you should now have your BTC in the new wallet you sent them to, and your BCH in the BCH wallet you just created.
- At this point, it is probably a good idea to quickly send that BCH somewhere, be it an exchange, or just a fresh BCH wallet (ie not the one recovered using your 12 word seed). This extra step helps mitigate against the risk of your 12-word seed being exposed to the internet when you entered it to create the BCH wallet. 
It is important to follow these steps in the right order, especially the part in bold. If you enter your 12-word seed into the BCH software before the BTC transaction is complete, you risk having malicious BCH wallet software steal any BTC left at those addresses. Perhaps there isn't a huge chance of this happening, but definitely better safe than sorry!
If you have any questions feel free to PM me, happy to help. Worth mentioning: DO NOT send your 12-word seed, password, or private keys to ANYONE offering to help.

This is not true, there is more than one wallet which includes coin-join functionality, without any requirement to trust a third party (eh Wasabi). Adam Gibson recently released a BIP draft for a non-interactive coinjoin technique called SNICKER. P2EP could be another great tech to build into wallets.
Lots of solutions exist, some are here today, others are on the foreseeable horizon. As these techs develop, they will be more easily integrated into a wider range of wallets. IMO this is a more viable solution than the entire industry switching to Monero, and rebuilding the massive amount of infrastructure that has been worked on for the past years.
Again, I do think Monero is interesting (one of the very, very few altcoins I'll say that about), but if I were forced to switch to a privacy-coin tomorrow, I think GRIN is more viable, if nothing else it scales much, much better than Monero's giant ring signatures will ever hope to, while still allowing a high level of anonymity.

I find Zcash much less interesting for a few reasons:
\- Confidential transactions are optional, and are more expensive to send on the network than regular transactions. So users are monetarily incentivized to not utilize the privacy features. This makes the actual anonymity set of Zcash quite small (last I saw, less than 10% of coins are in the shielded pool).
\- The initial setup of the network involved trusted parties, meaning you must trust that the founders did not create more coins than they said they would. 
\- Zcash pays a 'founders reward' from every block, back to a centralized organization. IMO this is dangerous in that it creates an unnecessary political tension and systems of control around who is in charge of receiving and disbursing those funds.

Anecdotally: I’ve used Bread in the past a bunch, and my experience was also that the fee estimation was most often bad (excessive), and sometimes both fee ‘options’ were in fact the same (ie, no actual option). I understand the argument of ‘simple is better for new users’, but overpaying and having no options is a very frustrating UI, having an advanced option for custom fees would be great, even if it meant displaying a disclaimer about what happens if you set fees too low, or whatever. 
The BRD token pushing also left a bad taste, it gives me the impression they’re more concerned with fundraising than actually delivering useful features. 
One thing I do like about bread is that you can easily manually connect to a node of your choice. 
Overall though, my experience has lead me to recommend against using bread to my friends. I’m patiently waiting for samurai to come to iOS :)

As a miner, you could send high fee txs to continuously bump the block size limit up. Large miners would therefore be incentivized to send a lot of these transactions, as it would increase the forces that lead to miner centralization. 
So I don't see this being a good fix. I think adding a way for a user's behaviour to alter consensus rules makes for a lot of complicated game theory. 
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:21:57
I think that is all true, but there are already ways to mitigate against someone learning your balance when you transact with them. As the easy example, LN transactions contain none of this information. Anecdotally, lately I find that if I am in a situation to spend some BTC, I am *much* more willing to do so if I can do so via the LN. No need to worry about UTXO management, fee rates, much more privacy, etc. 
The primary goal of privacy-tech in Bitcoin is to break analysis heuristics and homogenize transactions, if that can be accomplished then we will be in a much better place.

True, but if you're going to use electron cash, then you're already assuming it *isn't* malware. Just because it *could* be malware doesn't mean you should forgo any further protections. 
I guess its all just a balance of risks. If you had $500k worth of BCH, you would probably want to buy a new, clean machine to install eletron cash (and hell, maybe even pay some 'expert' to review the code you're about to run?), and then burn the computer afterwards (just for fun!). 
If you have $50 worth of BCH, then maybe you'd be comfortable loading it up onto your families vintage Windows 98 PC, and praying that none of the porno sites you visited a decade ago included malware that is now keylogging for btc-related inputs. 
(jokes aside, I do agree with you that it probably isn't a good idea to load electron cash onto a computer that you otherwise keep clean and trusted)

Keep in mind that a UTXO being consumed does not equal coins being sold to fiat. For very old UTXOs that move during huge price swings I think it is fair to assume that many of them are selling to fiat, but certainly not all of them. HODLers just might be moving to new wallets, consolidating inputs, etc. (The article mentions this in terms of movement to Segwit addresses). 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:38:20


That is more or less correct. The reality is: the network all agrees that some address on the blockchain has unspent outputs (bitcoins), if you have the private key for that address, you can spend those coins. 
So the actual wallet software is just the computer code that uses your private key to author/transmit transactoins. The bitcoins don't exist 'in the wallet', like a normal dollar bill would exist in your actual wallet. Instead, owning the coins comes down to owning the private key, and you can use various software implementations (wallets) to view and spend the funds associated with that key.
Cold wallets are different in one important aspect: the code used to generate the private/public keys is run on a computer that is not, and will never be, connected to the internet. This ensures that if the computer is infected with malware your coins will not be stolen, since the computer cannot communicate with the internet. 
IF someone got a hold of your 12 word phrase, they could still recreate your wallet, but since the device is not connected to the internet, it becomes MUCH more difficult to steal that phrase. 
On that note, once you have typed your 12-word passphrase into an internet-connected device, you should probably act to move those coins to a freshly created wallet, just in case some sort of keylogger exists on your device.

This is one thing that Bitcoin innovated - the removal of a centralized checkpoint. Instead, transactions are checked against a ledger, that is distributed across all of the nodes and miners in the network. So you could forge your own ledger that says you control 1000 coins, but if the rest of the network disagrees, then your transactions will not be accepted. All blocks are cryptographically related to the blocks that came before them, all the way back to the genesis block, so you can't just randomly insert a faulty block into the network - it would be rejected.
If you duplicate your hard drive you would have two instances of the same wallet. If you spend coins from one, the network will know that you spent those coins, so when you open the wallet on your other device, the balance will be updated once your wallet syncs with the network.

I don't think this is true. Cryptocurrencies allow for *programmable value*, that is something that has never existed before. We are all creating more and more data every day, and I think that having a system which can transact value along with that data will be incredibly useful, and thus valuable (ie, high price per coin). 
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:57:12
"Cold storage" generally refers to storing coins in an address that was generated by a computer that *never* connects to the internet. This gives the highest guarantee that the private key has not been exposed or compromised. 
So if you are downloading an app... it isn't cold storage by default. 
This isn't to say there are not good apps to choose from, it's just important to select the right storage method for the amount of value you are trying to hold and protect. More value asks for more security, of course.

Generally, the best investment strategy is [dollar cost averaging]( Who knows where this run-up will land? Your safest bet is to cut that $500 up into parts, and spend one part each week until you've spent it all.

@_date: 2017-07-13 19:06:25
TL;DR: it takes over 2 years to withdraw your investment, in btc. From their website:


So, you send them money, and then 6 months [edit: originally wrote 18 months by mistake] from now they send you back 1/18th of that investment, paid in btc (at a 20% discount from the 'spot price' that day). If you believe btc will increase in value (more than 20% in the next 18 months), you are likely MUCH better off just buying btc now, not this 'investment'.
20% swings can happen on the daily, if the value of btc increases over the next 18 months, there is a good chance it will be worth more than this (and I think that is exactly what this company is betting on).

Initiated a withdrawal in Jan. Didn't check it for awhile, then found it was never processed. Tried logging in, account was locked. After contacting support they unlocked the account, but I was running into problems because of my location when logging in. Cryptsy.com was redirecting me to another country-specific cryptsy site that has launched since I tried to withdraw. That site had no record of my account. So I emailed support again, and their response was "oh yes we know about that issue, tech is gonna work on it. We don't know when it will be resolved". 
Wtf! That was their best answer, even after I emailed back, asking for an actual solution. So I obscured my location and logged in to cryptsy.com, and initiated a new withdrawal. That one went through within a day.

@_date: 2017-07-17 05:43:21
That is a decent guide, but [this one is more thorough]( In an ideal world, the computer you use to generate the private key should *never* touch the internet, so you can be most sure that it is free of malware. Just turning off your internet connection during private key generation is an okay method that may be effective for most people, but it isn't the most secure way possible. 
Like I mentioned before, its about finding a balance between how much you're holding onto, and how secure it is.

You should always keep priv keys offline!! 
Being dusted doesn’t ‘dirty’ your coins, but if you want to preserve privacy you can use a wallet like wasabi to do so. 
Wallet recommendation depends on the users technical know how, amount being stored, an available hardware. 
My usual recommendations are bitcoin-core, electrum &amp; electrum personal server, a cold card hardware wallet, and/or wasabi. Most of those are fairly advanced UX though.

Edit: there are other ways to link addresses and accounts though, for example through IP address analyses. Also, I don’t recall exactly how the ledger app communicates with the network but it may sacrifice privacy there as well. If your friend searches out her addresses on a block explorer then that service would be able to link her IP address to those searches.  Etc.

Right, but how many people do you think have a computer that they are going to keep permanently offline after generating a paperwallet? Remember we’re supposedly talking about newbies, you and I may be informed but it’s a daunting task for many people. The costs and UX are very high. If you’re going to go through all that work, at that point you may as well run bitcoin-core wallet offline and use it to generate new addresses for you. 
But in any case, most websites that promote paper wallet use say ‘turn your wifi off and generate a cold wallet!’, not ‘get a computer you’ll never put online again and transfer these source code files to it’. 
So with the existence of that misinformation online, I think it’s safest to direct people towards the modern standards.

You should use a wallet that is generated using proper cryptographic techniques, preferably on a device that never connects to the internet. There are generally trade-offs between usability and security, you will have to make a wallet choice based on your situation and preferences. BIP32 / BIP 39 hierarchical deterministic wallets are an industry standard these days.

Here's an example to illustrate:  
You had an address that held some bitcoin a year ago, but the bitcoin at that address is long since spent. Looking at the transactions associated with that account, someone could make some guesses about which other addresses are controlled by the same wallet.   
Today, someone does a dust attack, and it includes your old address, so now your wallet knows you have a very small amount of bitcoin held at that address.  
Now, you send a transaction, and you wallet uses that old UTXO, along with some newer UTXOs, to build the transaction. So now, someone could guess that the wallet that contains you old address, also contains your new address.   
In this way, a dust attack allows someone to get a better picture of which addresses are controlled by which wallets. Keep in mind the common-input-ownership-heuristic is not perfect, there are many types of transactions that break it, but unfortunately it is still nonetheless useful in many cases.

Yea I agree with all of that. Your point about BMIs is an endpoint I worry about as well. Even before we reach that point, with every passing moment humankind is digitizing more and more of the conscious experience. New techs and apps are creating more and more data, and our current internet paradigm largely just sells it out to advertising dollars. 
It all seems to be a recipe for disaster, I expect that in the coming years we'll see some cyber attacks that push the issue onto centre stage. People flock to convenient solutions, so I think that the heavy inconvenience of an attack will likely be what causes a paradigm shift, unless a re-work is pushed from the top down. Hopefully a solution is implemented that allows the individual to regain digital sovereignty, otherwise BMI techs will centralize consciousness itself, and this seems like a very undesirable end. Saying nothing of an individual's desires, evolutionary fitness is simply highest when a population's diversity is preserved.

If you are running a fully archived node that serves historical blocks to peers, then you are in some sense ‘helping the network’, by allowing new nodes to query your node for the blockchain history. 
But that is not the reason we should expect someone to run a node. Hoping for altruism is not a game theoretical equilibrium upon which a network like this can be built. As others have mentioned, running a node is beneficial to *the user themself*, in that it allows them to independently validate the state of the network, and thus verify the transactions relevant to them. 
In other words, I could boot up 1000 nodes on AWS, and it would do almost nothing ‘for the network’, compare that to a node I run on my own machine at home, used to verify that my transactions are included in the Bitcoin blockchain history.

The majority hashpower assumption is required within the context of a 51% majority attack, or a soft fork rule change. It is *not* required in the context of miners forcing a hard fork rule change. That is a different situation, and users can protect themselves from miners enforcing a hard fork rule change by running a node and independently verifying the current state of the network. 


The Byzantine generals problem states it is difficult for a distributed network to agree upon ‘what a the state of the network is’. This is distinct from determining ‘what rules the network state must follow from’. An honest majority of hashpower can help us determine the network’s state, but defining the rules around which consensus is reached is what full nodes do. 
And this is why full nodes are important. Preventing the tampering and abuse of monetary rules is critical to the Bitcoin project.

I tried to find some more technical details on your product, but the website didn’t have much info, just general marketing kinda blurbs. 
I’m not sure I understand the advantage of using one of these. The mobile application needs to perform signing calculations in order to use the wallet, so the design is basically a mobile wallet, but the private keys need to be retrieved via NFC from the card each time you’d like to spend? 
That seems like a poorer security model than just keeping the keys on the device, because the keys will need to be broadcast via NFC, encrypted or not. I’m not an expert on how NFC-received data is handled in mobile hardware, but it seems like there would be additional considerations to ensure sensitive data isn’t exposed to an insecure memory store in the device. 
I guess as an additional backup it could be useful, but I think it’s a misnomer to call it ‘cold storage’, since the keys will be generated on an (assumedly) internet connected device in the first place. Storing them offline later doesn’t make it ‘cold storage’.

Users running full nodes helps protect against miners enforcing a hard fork rule change, there is no majority honesty assumption. The miners *can* enforce a soft fork rule change, and that is why, for example, bitcoin-core will give a warning if unknown version blocks are mined (note: overt asicboost uses version rolling, and is causing this warning to be displayed regularly lately). But enforcing a hard fork rule change is hard, you need the majority of users to go along with you or else you will be wasting your hashpower. 
So the smaller the number of nodes, the easier it is to change the rules in any way, since it would be easier to enforce a hard fork rule change. SPV cannot provide protection in this regard.

Nope, once one miner confirms it in a block, the other miners will download and validate the new block, and remove all the txs included in that block from their mempools.

The dusting attack does work, and that is why someone is spending money to do it. This is how it works:  
Wallet software builds transactions by looking at the amount you want to spend, and then finding UTXOs you own that add up to at least that amount, to use as inputs for the transaction. So if someone sends dust to a bunch of random addresses you've used in the past, your wallet might create a transaction that uses all of those dust UTXOs as input, in the same transaction. Using the 'common-input-ownership-heuristic', someone might infer that a single person owns all of the inputs in the transaction, and thus a bunch of your old, previously unlinked transactions would now be linked to the same wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:39:05
I do not know, sorry. 
If it doesn’t, you can always import your seed phrase into some wallet software that does allow UTXOs to be marked unspendable, although you should always be VERY careful when inputting your seed phrase into new software/device. 
Generally, there is no reason to unmark a dust output to make it spendable. In many cases, it will cost more in fees to spend it than the output is worth.

Interesting that the 'solution' in this case (Spotify) just bends to the current status quo: make it convenient, and the masses don't care about the technical freedom they have (or don't have).

If an ISP/gov wanted to restrict the transfer of btc-related data, their methods of parsing that data out of the rest would **not** depend on the *amount* of data being transmitted. They would more likely watch for anyone communicating with known nodes (certain IP addresses), or maybe certain destination ports (8333 is btc on the clearnet, though other applications use this port as well I think), or maybe some other way I'm not thinking of right now. 
However, in those cases there are ways to hide or obfuscate the relevant info, like connecting through the Tor network, or maybe hiding your transaction info within other internet traffic.

Ah,  my mistake, I meant that a majority of hashpower is not *sufficient* to enforce a hard fork rule change, because you also need to convince the users that run nodes to join the new network. Though in the strictest sense, a majority is not *required* either. As an example, BCH has stayed alive as a bitcoin hard-fork, despite having only a fraction of the hashpower. 
‘The network’ is helped by a larger userbase running full nodes, in the sense that each individual full-node user will have a larger guarantee that it will be difficult to enact a hard fork rule change, as the number of (economically engaged) network nodes grows. 


Even if a *majority* of hashpower enforces a hard fork rule change, old nodes will simply ignore them, and the rule-changing miners would create a new network, forked off the original. The users would have to update their code if they wished to join the new-rules fork, and that is part the security mechanism: users that run full nodes must be convinced to follow the new chain. The more nodes there are, the harder it becomes to coordinate and convince all of them to change to the new rules. 
SPV nodes do not enforce rules in the same way, so if the network was composed of solely SPV nodes, it would be very insecure against hard fork rule changes.

For a simple option that works fine for small amounts of money, you can download the 'bread wallet' app on your phone. Open the app, write down the pass phrase, and store it somewhere VERY secure. You can then transfer btc to bread wallet, and once the transfer is confirmed, delete the app.

Gold and crypto do not have mutually exclusive fates. Each one is good at things the other is not, even if some of their functions do overlap.

When you send some btc, your wallet will sign a transaction that says you are sending a certain unspent output to a new address (or multiple addresses), and then broadcast that transaction to all the nodes you are connected to. If you are using a full-node wallet, then you will be connected to some peers in the network, and those peers will then relay your message to the peers they are connected to, etc. After some amount of time, the whole node network will know about your transaction.
Nodes will keep a tx that has been relayed to them in their memory (their 'mempool'), until a miner includes that tx in a block, or a certain amount of time passes.
If you are using an SPV wallet (eg breadwallet), then your wallet will send the tx info to the node your wallet relies on, and that node will broadcast the tx to the network.
Some nodes are miners, and when a miner finds a new block they will select txs that have been relayed to them, to be included in the new block. This block is then relayed out to the network's nodes, after a couple of blocks the tx is solidified in the blockchain's history.

I think that is true, but given sufficient time, someone would code up an 'easier to use solution' that the average person could handle. Adoption would be hindered greatly compared to an open-access scenario, but once a critical mass is hit, the desire to take part in the system will motivate the average person to find a way to join in on the crypto fun. 
For example, china blocks Facebook, yet I still regularly keep in touch with business contacts in china on Facebook. They get around restriction using a technical solution, made easy by a selection of VPN services. 
The bit torrent network is another example, though govts restricted sharing of copyrighted content, coders are developing continuously easier-to-use solutions to make the tech accessible to more and more people.

What is to stop a user from working up the reputation rank, only to gain a position of power and then quietly game the system for their own gains?

Modern bitcoin wallets derive key pairs using a standardized key derivation algorithm, as defined in [BIP 32]( Since this algorithm is standardized, any wallet that uses it can be used to recover a wallet created by any other wallet that also uses it. 
To allow backups, the wallet will present you with a mnemonic seed phrase (defined in BIP39), which you will need to store securely in order to later restore your wallet in the event that the device your wallet is instantiated on is lost or destroyed. A wallet stores keys, not bitcoins, so you can always recover your coins by using your seed phrase to recreate your wallet on a new device. 
Note that there are infinite possible derivation paths for each mnemonic seed phrase, so there are some standards defined for which path to use, but not all wallets will use the same path! In some cases you may need to find software that accepts a custom path, in order to recover a wallet that used a non-standard derivation. See BIP44, 49, and 84. 
What all this means in less technical terms: if you use a wallet that a) gives you full control to your keys (non custodial!), and b) uses these key derivation standards, then you do not need to worry if the developers that made the wallet quit, or the app is discontinued, or whatever. Just keep your seed phrase safe, and you can use it to recreate your wallet using any other software that also follows these standards.

Happy to help. It’s a nuanced topic, and there is blatant misinformation out there that can be hard to spot at first. Education is important, as they say: *Don’t trust, verify!*
And honestly, back to my original recommendation: do check out the bitcoin stack exchange if you are curious to learn, it contains a wealth of knowledge. Reddit can be quite hit or miss in this regard.

Deflationary currency discourages spending, but not in situations where the expected returns from spending are greater than the expected returns from just hodling. 
You can speculate on future prices being higher, but what if you needed to free up some capital to seal a business deal that *you knew for certain* would return 50% profit in just a couple months?
What if all your worth was in btc, but you *need* to pay rent still? (Having a place to live now outweighs riches later)
Deflation discourages spending, but certainly not in an outright way.

A ledger connects to nodes in the network in order to download the relevant transaction info and display a users balance. 
If the nodes you connect to have not been patched, then your ledger could be affected by an exploit of the bug. 
However, at this time, enough of the network has upgraded, rendering any potential attack using this exploit null.
So as a ledger user, you are safe, but still depending on others to provide accurate info to you. The best thing you can do to ensure your financial sovereignty is to run a full node yourself :)

Each node keeps its own mempool, and the node operator can configure the mempool as they see fit. In some cases, they may elect to not even keep a mempool at all. 
‘Network location’ just describes where a certain node in the network is. Since the network is distributed, each node will have a different ‘local neighbourhood’.

Pricing is definitely going to be a large factor for many people, though by definition a decentralized system will be more costly to deploy and use. The beauty of  decentralized systems comes not from their cost savings, but from their security and sovereignty. 
This doesn't mean we won't see cheaper solutions than what currently exist, but I think it does mean that centralized solutions will need to take cuts to their profits in order to remain competitive. 
What we need would be a cultural shift, so that the average person will be aware of the risks, and happy to pay the price to secure their digital autonomy. I don't think this is impossible to achieve, I can already think of some situations in which people are willing to pay more than the minimum, in order to gain more security (ie car insurance, basic coverage vs full coverage).

 How do you go about it, granted I am intentionally trying to "mine" some of it or whatever, but if I lefit want to squirrel it away in a savings account for a year to see what happens, how would I do that?
You buy some and hold onto it. There are many exchanges and other places you can purchase btc from, once you have purchased it you can hold it by transferring it to a secure wallet you control.  
For the highest level of security (ie a long-term 'savings' account), you'll want to search out 'cold storage', and follow the instructions closely. 
Mining has become a very competitive industry, so unless you are quite competent, have access to very cheap electricity, and have a reasonable amount of capital to devote to the project, mining is likely not for you.

A dust attack generally creates really low value outputs (‘dust’), so the fees involved with spending those outputs will often be larger than the output itself. So no, a mixer will not help in this regard.

Blacklisting addresses would require nodes/miners to ALL keep an updated list of blacklisted addresses. If even one miner decided not to do this, then the blacklisted coins could still be spent, and from that alone a whole world of issues arises. 
What if the attacker sends those coins to along big exchange? Or a notable charity or celebrity's address? Now ALL of the unspent output associated with that address will be tainted, so if that exchange wants to send coins to customers (ie withdrawals), part of the network will ignore that transaction, and whoever inadvertently receives those tainted coins will have similar issues spending them down the road. 
A coin *must* be just a coin, any black/whitelisting efforts hurt the system greatly. Who wants to use a system where the coins you receive might be tainted, and thus have *less spending power?*

Not to be rude, but this idea shows a misunderstanding of one of the main and most powerful thesis' of cryptocurrencies: a trustless system that is resilient to political control.

Permissionless innovation, for one thing. Cryptocurrencies will allow for value to be programmable in ways not possible before, apple pay cash will not have that same freedom. At best, apple will likely just restrict developers to interacting with an Apple Pay cash API when writing apps. 
Cryptocurrencies are useful in ways far beyond what apple's system will provide. They may compete in some aspects, but certainly not in all. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:47:28
Simply seeing btc as a pyramid scheme is a very uninformed stance to take. The technology allows us to create programmable value in ways that *have never before existed*. This is one of the things that gives bitcoin value. 
Yes, the more people that use it, the more valuable it becomes, but to have that realization and then simply write off the project as a pyramid scheme shows a lack of understanding.

How do you discern what is work of value, and what is spam? If users are rewarded value for completing tasks, whats to stop someone from writing a bot that just floods the network with work? (consider the eventual situation of a successful network: youtube has so much content uploaded *every second* that they can't even hope to have humans moderate it all.) 


Human moderation = a chance for bad actors or politics to affect the system. Cryptocurrencies are a type of system which has removed much of the 'human factor', and thus are 'trustless' in their operation. Requiring trusted human interaction for network operation undermines this. 


Sure. But then one person pays to access the content, and copies it onto a torrent server. And now it is available for free.


Not to be rude, but you make a lot of incredibly generalized statements... I'm lead to believe you don't understand the technical requirements of a system like the one you're describing. I like your motivation and line of reasoning though, I too have spent time considering how intellectual property could be merged with blockchain tech to create a more fair and useful system. It is an interesting, but difficult problem to solve (probably the reason many cypherpunks reject the idea of IP at all).

It is fast, but not optimized in the same way that ASIC chips are, so it is doubtful it would have better returns than a piece of hardware specifically designed and optimized for the btc POW algorithm.

You cannot point two nodes at the same datadir at the same time. Perhaps you can point both sides of a dual boot at the same folder, but you may risk a corrupted chainstate. This could make for a good Q on bitcoin.stackexchange.com.

These attacks happen from time to time, there is no telling how or why the attackers choose certain addresses, but generally if you receive these transactions it isn't really a cause for concern. It just means someone is trying to group addresses together for blockchain analysis of some sort (ie, if the attack is successful, it is bad for your privacy).  
The good news is that better wallet software can ignore these transactions and protect you against the attack pretty easily. If enough users have wallets like this, then it will become unprofitable for the attacker in the first place and we might see dust attacks happen much less frequently.

Internet dependency can also be mitigated against by obfuscating transactions, burying them in otherwise innocuous looking internet transactions. This would work as long as the majority of govts do not attempt to restrict or control access to cryptocurrencies. As long as there is a healthy node count online, if your local govt cracked down on crypto you could still get transactions in/out quite easily. 
A rework of the internet architecture would be the best case scenario though, I do agree with that. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:50:05














How do you propose the system is able to distinguish which users have actually done valuable work? 
It seems that the system is highly dependant on human oracles interacting honestly, which leaves a large attack surface. 
There is also the issue of content in the system being re-distributed *outside* of the system. If that happens, and people can get the content for free, then why would they partake in the system?

Out of curiosity, is there any 'safe' way to share the private key of an individual address that was generated by an HD wallet? (ie. a way that would not share the private key used as a seed for the entire wallet)
If it is possible, couldn't the method could be used to facilitate off-chain 'transactions'? Albeit with narrow use-cases due to a need for a high level of trust between participating users. I'm imagining a situation such as a parent giving their child access to a specific address, while still also remaining in control of the funds themselves. (though it seems that a multi-sig address would have the same function and a simpler design) 
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:09:51
This heuristic is used on other UTXOs as well, but in the case of dust attacks it causes the user to inadvertently have past address be reused and linked together, and those past addresses may not have otherwise been linked.
Keep in mind this heuristic isn’t perfect though, lots of newer wallet tech is purposefully trying to break it.

($0.10 / $75perbtc) = 0.001333333 btc

Similar to something like PayPal: it’s of little consequence. It’s a different kind of thing, that is using the ‘cryptocurrency clout’ to get some traction (and probably funding). I’m sure they can build a good product that will get some use, but it will in no way be a true competitor to the sorts of things Bitcoin can offer humanity. 
In any case, who is going to trust Facebook with their financial info? Nope. Nope. Nope.

You should look around bitcoin.stackexchange.com, you’ll find some posts relevant to your question there, and you could always post a question of your own if you aren’t satisfied with what you find. 
Some examples from a quick search:
[ 
[ 
To answer your question more directly: we should expect users to run a full node to verify their transactions, without trusting some third party. Running a node for some altruistic network-helping reason isn’t a dependable form of security, it is a secondary effect at best. SPV does not allow a user to verify all transactions being included by miners are valid, so there is an increased level of trust required in using an SPV/light wallet (and there are privacy concerns as well). 
Your question is also about the ability to soft fork a rule change by mounting a full node Sybil attack. This is where things become a little bit more tricky, something like a UASF only work if the majority of miners believe that the economic majority of full nodes are going to implement the rule change, and thus ignore new blocks that don’t follow the new rules. 
So even if you spin up a million fake nodes that attempt a UASF, there is no reason miners will care. We should expect the miners to follow economic incentives, and all of the economic activity will still be coming from the non-Sybil nodes.

This is not quite correct... new btc is generated at a predictable rate. One block every 10 mins (on avg), with 50 new btc minted in each block (this number halves every ~4 years. Currently we're at 12.5 btc per block). 
Even though it becomes 'more difficult' to mine btc, this change in difficulty is based upon the hashpower of the network, the actual rate of btc generation is set according to the rules I mentioned above. 
It is likely a balance will be struck between the rate of new coins being minted, and economic use. The free market at work, if you will.

You could set up a series of transactions that happen in sequence, each one broadcasting the tx with a higher fee than the last.
