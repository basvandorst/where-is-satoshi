The fuck is wrong with you? BCH? Seriously? And yeah, got fucked by shapeshit trying to convert LTC to BTC ($23 lost in $56 transaction). And they played it off as if I was crazy once I contacted support. Never fuckin with them again, they can smd.

Any signs where there isn't a lot of traffic or there's skyscraper's, yes. Graffiti everywhere.  80000lb semi's aren't rolling through chicago anytime soon... There's no reason the streets should be this fucked up other than our cold winters. If nobody in the civil engineering field has come up with a solution to that then fine, even though that's pretty sad for that side of engineering to be that incapable. Anyways here's some history about Chicago:

You'll lose money proportionally. So if its 20k when you buy it and it goes down to 10k, youll then have (10k / 20k) x $10 = $5

I'm pretty sure I got screwed by coinbase over the fork. Shows up as me only having .0016 bch when I know I had at least .015 BTC in August.

Definitely did, getting me excited for Mechanical engineering (looking forward to automotive design). Come from a background of offroad motorsports, but I will say the Ferrari was quite fun -to say the least :)

"Social duty" lmao it's the government's duty to not fucking waste my goddamn money on a bullshit budget.

Well I can tell you this, Chicago roads are ABSOLUTELY fucked and we pay 11% sales tax in the outskirts of cook county alone. Our roads are basically never finished and two lane streets stay open as one lane streets cause of it. Its a fucking shit pit. Shit infrastructure. Shit politicians. Shit every fucking thing. To hell with taxes in general. I'd rather pay for a better suspension than be perpetually fucked in the ass rawdog.

What would you all suggest as a coinbase user to move my BTC, LTC, and ETH off of coinbase? I'm on android if that helps. I hear samuraiwallet is good? Anybody have better ideas?
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:35:02
-has access to wallet with written down code
-will "give" ownership of wallet away
-wants a smaller chunk of btc for it
