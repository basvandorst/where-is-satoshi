Hmm, so the features could be introduced in a sidechain if not to the entire protocol. 
So is it currently possible, right now, to have a alt-like side chain? Could it be done with zero counterpart risk?
If I understand correctly, the only current sidechain is liquid, which is essentially an off chain settlement layer (pls correct me if I am wrong). I assume Liquid does not have their own set of miners mining their sidechain. 
Actually come to think of it, Sidechains haven't been a popular discussion point in a while. I thought the general consensus on it was that they were inefficient insecure and a waste of time? 
Is creating a sidechain permissionless? I wonder why we don't see more of them.

Yes, I agree about Ripple, and am dismissive of ethereal as well. 
It seems like consensus would only get reached if a coin could objectively prove that they are better. But the only real way to prove it, is if that altcoin reaches a dedicated following and starts to see the volume that bitcoin has been stress tested for already. 
So once an Alt has proved it objectively, the network effect might end up moving to a new coin, that functions more efficiently. It might be too late at that point. Similar to how banks might be too late to compete with the Bitcoin blockchain. Don't you think?
Objectivity is interesting because nothing is truly objective. Do you think Politics and gridlock can muck up a lot of opportunity?
What about fungibility? Some coins have great fungibility features.

theymos's original point was that the usd was democraticly controlled. its not. unelected officials control the money supply. the fact that elected officials appoint is true, but the current model isn't democratic. it could be purely democratic, but its not. that degree of separation from democratic to appointed makes it so its no longer a democratic process. but sure your right, that how it was created by our elected officials. our democraticly elected officials made it undemocratic.

fiscal policy is never an election issue. No one is every elected on a platform to raise or lower interest rates, or increase or decrease QE. Government is in charge of fiscal policy, but americans don't vote on who should be in charge or what the plan should be. so it still stands that fiscal policy in america and US dollars are not a democratic issue.

US Dollar policy doesn't work through elections. It works through the federal reserve who's chairmen are appointed by the US President

Its a little hard to tell, but the math starts with this:
1,000,000 bytes per block. Current average fee to get a transaction through is 60 satoshis per byte comes to about $260 per block. (1,000,000bytes x 60satoshis) = .6 BTC
In reality in order to flood the network you only need to increase the transactions enough to bump other 'legitimate' transactions to not confirming. So it really depends on how much capacity is 'excess capacity' which is pretty impossible to determine. If there is only 10% free capacity you only need to flood the network with 100,000bytes of transactions which would only cost you $25/block. as the price rises the cost of spamming rises too. but also as time goes on and more people come to the network, there are more 'legitimate' transactions so the cost becomes less. I guess we won'e really have to worry about the second part as much anymore though.
edit; maths

I don't think anyone is against Bitcoin as a settlement system, certainly not in the long term. But its hard to put a lot of hope into a solution that has a lot of risks baked into it. Namely, the lightening network hasn't figured out how to route transactions, and that price volatility of bitcoin might make a settlement system less utilized (people will want to confirm transactions very quickly if the value of bitcoin is volatile).
So we have a potential system that hasn't theoretically been determined to be viable. But we WANT it to be viable really. Its just that there is a risk it might not pan out that way or it might take a long time to figure out those problems. Its important to manage that risk.
IF we had the lightening network currently, we could be going through the same debacle as now, but at least we would have a solution of transferring our bulk transactions to LN. However, that possibility doesn't exist today. Instead we have to wait a few years for the network to be really ready to handle capacity. This waiting carries with it a large drawback of stifling our growth momentum and limiting potential consumer adoption. In the future we might not differentiate between transactions on or off chain, it'll just be using bitcoin. However now, bitcoin doesn't work as digital cash, only as digital gold with a potential to be used as cash in a few years. Before we hit these capacity limits, it was common to say that bitcoin was a p2p cash and a digital gold, now it really only functions as a digital gold, which people might be less inclined to jump on board to.
Do we need the lightening network? IMO it would be amazing to have, especially since at even 8GB blocks, the network can really only scale to service about a couple hundred million people (8,000 x 200,000 / 7 transactions a day). But the hard part to swallow is suppressing  the network now when the urgency to switch over to LN will occur naturally anyways, when the users stretch the natural limitations of block capacity.
This using Bitcoin as a settlement network is new to me, I thought this would be something that came along in a few more years, and we would just have block capacity increases as the network capacity grew. In that way using "bitcoin" could always be used as everyday transactions. That's no longer the sales pitch. Now it is just a digital gold settlement network, with little or no utility on its own. Not sexy at all.

Don't understand why you would consider it so aggressively wrong. Gmaxwell says himself that there will tradeoffs that need to be made as far as centralization and scalability. The most urgent problems now are fungibility and scalability. The example cited above deals with both those problems head on.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:22:57
Don't see how fungibility of the base layer really matters when everyone will probably need kyc to interact in a payment channel. who cares if its completely anonymous if you have to reveal all that info when you want to actually transact in it.

potato tomato bruseff. 
Its not an increase int he money supply either technically because of bitcoins charachteristics of currency and Commodity. It would be a increase in supply.
But I will say that it is inflation since as more coins get distributed My share of the bitcoin network diminishes at the rate of bitcoin supply increase.
I don't think any conventional terms that relate to currency or commodities can actually be accurately related to Bitcoin.
Currencies are always inflationary, commodoties are always increasing in supply materially forever. There is no effective hard cap on gold since the supply of gold increases at 3% annually through mining. Plus that rate of increase has been consistent for 50 years and has no sign of slowing down.
The bitcoin inflation rate at 9% is colloquially understood to relate to the increase in the amount of bitcoins, and certainly has **SOME** effect on prices which **HAVE** been inflationary in the past year. Items priced in Bitcoin increased in Bitcoin value.
In any case the heart of what I am asserting still carries weight. Bitcoins are getting dumped on the market and that is putting immense pressure on pricing. Its great to know that the effects of that will be diminishing over a survivable amount of time. And once the supply coming to market comes down after a couple halvings, we will begin to see the stability we crave. and its only 5 years away which in the scope of life, really isn't that bad.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:03:30
That is assuming that it is a perfectly efficient market which this is far from. Although its possible that it is already priced in, it is possible that it is not priced in right now.

There's really no hope in having Bitcoin used as a global ledger if the block-size remains small. If its too small for transactions, its going to be too small for use as a public ledger as well

why/how would 8gb blocks 20 years from now kill bitcoin?

A network that is entirely dependent on level 2 services is going to act just like paypal does.

money wasted. As long as the block limit stays small there's no way that its going to be used for asset settlements period.

Yes, true, there is an extra step to invest in it. However, the premise of the argument is that a drop in value in GBTC indicates something is going to happen with the ETF. 
It is not a good canary for the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF since GBTC could decrease in value due to an unrelated reason. Namely, because there is already an incentive to arbitrage the investment by divesting from GBTC and investing in the ETN.
