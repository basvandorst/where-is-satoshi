We're all in the same boat. Was this your first deposit as well? Seems like all first time deposits today during the maintenance are still nowhere to be seen.

...Then when they buy back the dumped coins, the price climbs again. 
HODL on through this, and it'll be a hell of a ride.

Which password manager is this?

And....your Dropbox just got a huge target on it.

I am using the Segwit chain, but not going to pretend I know enough about this aspect of it to know how it affects this scenario. I was thinking about setting a low fee when the mempool clears just to consolidate everything into one. I'm in no hurry at all, just looking to the future.

It's close. I realize that. As of right now, 9.06% is the real number.

I had Mac and cheese with scallops for lunch today. Am I in this category? Seriously. I did. And it was fantastic.

Do not put your seed words on any website....you'll lose your funds.

Transfer to gdax and send from there. No fees to send to the paper wallet. But they'll still have to pay a fee if they want to withdraw it at some point.

There is an unlimited number of ways to store your seed. Any of them that involve the internet introduce a degree of danger, regardless of how you mix them up. Ask yourself this, in 10 years are you going to remember that you used every third word, or whatever your method is. If you got hit by a bus tonight, would your next of kin have any idea what the string of numbers is, or what to do with it? I think most people here would recommend writing your seed words down with a pen and paper and storing them. Use a pass phrase, and store it in a different place.

1/3rd on each accomplishes nothing. You can accomplish the same thing by putting it in the same 24-word wallet with three different passphrases.  That being said, I have both just for peace of mind. But they are both linked to the same wallet.

Where was this booth? This doesn't sound right.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:34:05
Sorry about your luck today. It could have been a lot worse. Consider it a $70 lesson, do some more reading, and get back on the rocket.

I own one of each. I have one at work and one at home. It's nice to be able to transact at either place, and there's a certain sense of security having two devices available. My wallet shows up flawlessly on either device.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:12:57
They are done maintenance, and it's still not showing up. Have you had any experience with filing a support ticket? They've already moved the BTC from my deposit address to their wallet, but there is still no deposit showing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:02:56
Awesome. Thanks for the quick response.

It has made you 9.27% the past 24 hours....

Try LastPass authenticator. It backs up your 2FA seed to your LastPass account. And if you're not using LastPass (or something similar) you should be. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:32:04
Set up LastPass authenticator next time. It backs up your 2FA codes for this exact situation.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:38:50
I think everyone here would highly discourage entering your words into a website. Or typing them into any web enabled device. But, do as you please. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:38:02
Just a heads up. They aren't going to like it over there. There's much less risky ways to meet the minimum spend. (Ive spent $200,000 in 6 months for the sole purpose of racking up points and haven't paid a penny of interest.  But that's a discussion for another place)
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:38:38
Put it on a Trezor, securely store the seed. Create several public addresses and wipe the Trezor. It takes some serious effort to gain access to your wallet, and you're much likely to Hodl instead of panic sell.

What are my 400,000 Chase points worth? Any takers?

Get off your high horse. He didn't say he wanted to make "substantial profit". He wants to invest in bitcoin. He'll make the same percentage of his investment as you and I.

Check out It's an entire community built around maximizing credit card points. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:14:56
Seems completely legit....
Edit...go away. This has nothing to do with bitcoin and I hope you lose every penny you have to this scam.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:19:58
I had one take almost 2 hours today to show up in the receiving address. Everything must be swamped right now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:04:02
 Not one person in my real world life knows I own any bitcoin. I plan on keeping it like that until the day I die or the day I retire. I have nothing to gain by talking to others about it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:57:23
I'll ask the obvious....how old are you? Either way, you likely won't have anyone say no around here.

Long waiting times and fees? I consolidated my holdings this morning with a 3 sat/byte fee and it got confirmed in an hour or so. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:04:34
Thanks. Never seen that happen before. Had a slight panic when I though that was my fee I paid.
