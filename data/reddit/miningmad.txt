2 academics and a politician/investor. That's far from 'a lot,' and their opponents far outweight them in numbers and collective experience.
BU completely changes the game theories of mining and bitcoin consensus. It adds an entirely new layer beyond Nakimoto consensus and I would take a very critical view of any academic who supports activation of BU because the very concept has not been around long enough for proper study.

I think the key thing about "signaling" vs "voting" is that miners cannot actually vote against a soft-fork, they can only signal they are ready or they can abstain and do nothing.  There is not a true "no" option, there is only a "yes" option, which is exactly what makes it a signal not a vote.
If BIP9 voting actually had a Yes option and a No option and after a certain period of blocks the majority of votes won (and abstainee miners were ignored) then it would be a vote.

"confirmation" alone means the first confirmation, or inclusion in a block.  Further confirmations (e.g. to 6 confirmations) of course increase the security of that reversal; but, it is highly unlikely you will have a transaction included, and the including block to be orphaned while the orphaning block does not have your transction.

It seems, based on your first comment, that the difference is I have LOOKED AT the code review process and code commits responsible.  As a career developer I found it absurd that in one (seeminly un-reviewed) commit someone created a 51% hardfork error in BU and inserted unbelivably unprofessional variable names.  If you haven't taken the 2 minutes to look, then your reply and opinion are nothing more then trolling. And based on the fact that you're replying to my comments on reddit...

I'm sure. It's highly recommended, but not neccesary. Core has even offered alternative "assurance methods" if a miner wanted to not upgrade even permanently. , thst would ensure they can produce non-segwit blocks but protect themselves from building on invalid segwit-style blocks. Check more recent articles that relate specifically to segwit fork, not just general about all BIP9 forks.

Yes there is a huge limitation to what you suggest. A USB device cannot force something to be downloaded unless it impersonates a keyboard like I said previously. Even that is extremely limited because it requires knowledge of the key sequences required to launch a browser, access a url, accept the download, and launch the trojan.  That's hard or actually impossible to do with a predermined key sequence on most OS, and that's presuming the USB is even targetting the right OS.
And if you are crazy enough to not immediately unplug the power cable when you notice your computer typing without you... well, nuff said.

Have you read the BU code tho? It's filled with unprofessional crap, terrible variable names, etc. These aren't things you change with time, they are things you do from the beginning or set a very poor precident for how your code will evolve.  Changing code that you don't understand without proper review isn't really comparable to the fork 4 years ago either.
Furthermore, "Core" did not exist in the period you refer to.

No... this simply isn't true; not in any way if you understand how USB and device drivers work. There MUST be a software component - and that is all open source for the products mentioned. A USB device cannot access the internet unless software on the hosts enables that. A USB device cannot run code on the host; a USB cannot transfer files without software interaction; etc.
The absolute worse thing I can imagine is it impersonating a keyboard, and even then it would have to be designed with specific knowledge of the host computer.

Those aren't even official BIPs... it is as likely that the BU team implements either such change as it is likely the core team does so.
Having ideas documented and/or in development is a first step of many. 
Some ideas (ala BIPs) will be superseded, some will be abandoned, some will be forgotten. 
Others will be developed and refined and developed and refined and rebased and reviewed and refined and etc etc... and never get used.
And some will be gradually reviewed and accepted.
And then a very rare some will be useful in case of dire emergency and we will all be very glad it exists (e.g. PoW change).
Just because the idea exists doesn't mean it it happening. You aren't being attacked if someone thinks about stabbing you; but you are being attacked if that someone is wielding a knife.

Anything larger then 1MB would be "too big" by your logic tho - unless there is already consensus, it is highly unlikely any miner would stick their neck out and risk their income by making a larger block period.
You realize what you just said amounts to "no, they can build on any chain; but by design they build on the longest chain." AKA they should, by conceptual design, always build on the longest chain. BU destroys this concept.
You seem to be conveniently ignoring the fact that BU's emergent consensus design was shown to be significantly flawed and create a dangerous attack vector by enabling excessive blocks to be universally approved... They added a ton of complexity (untested I might add) to cover it up, but shit is still shit.

Why? You would be decreasing usability for no gain.  It doesn't cost more to include more transactions in the block, which is why miners include free transactions up to the block size limit already.

Your posts are still here, and you certainly haven't offered any real evidence that a hard-fork is a superior way to implement it...  Probably because the reasons to use a soft-fork where possible far outweight any minor benefit from code simplicity in a hard-fork?
@_date: 2017-01-24 12:30:06
Why do people go back to the whitepaper all the time? Are all nodes miners? No... The whitepaper was before development even - it is outdated.  Bitcoin was not "designed to work like that" - miners are supposed to build on the longest chain, not the chain branch they decide they like more.
I don't think you understand the game theory change and effect that a flexible blocksize thru emergence like in BU has on consensus. It makes confirmations to a minor depth nearly worthless. It also would be crazy for a miner to produce larger blocks period, since the chance of the block being orphaned won't possibly outweigh the fees gained. This isn't even to mention the recognized flaws in the original emergent consensus model (the devs themselves realized the serious flaw - thank god it wasn't activated prior) that required the addition of signicant complications to bury.
I'm not again't hard forking to a larger static blocksize, but BU is a terrible design for many reasons.

Minority vs Majority chain in a split doesn't matter at all if something if a soft-fork or a hard-fork.  Blacklisting a block is never a hard-fork; it is a restriction of the rules not an expansion, and so by definition it is a soft-fork.

In case it's actually stupidity, you should know that comparing a chain to a protocol improvement is entirely nonsensical... oh, and you also know BCH used the segwit signature format in their hard-fork, right? BCH was litterally based on segwit's code - go see git.
@_date: 2017-01-24 12:21:11
No it doesn't... higher fees discourage some people from making less-neccesary transactions until such a time as there is a less bloated mempool.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:54:02
Pretty huge difference, and it's not even slightly comparable. Bitcoin was originally mined with cheap CPUs using almost no power. BCH started it's life with ASICs costing significant amounts to run, and they were run at a loss on BCH until 2 days ago.

Mining profits are often very miniscule and any advantage can be huge. AMD might turn around and build mining chips with HBM2 on board. It's such early days for crypto that the big ASIC manufactures like AMD or Intel are only starting to look. But, it'll come; AMD in particular has been looking at mining quite seriously recently.
Now, when you talk about a PoW like Cuckoo, IMO, you'll still see ASICs if the mining revenue is high enough to support production. But, unlike algos intended for use on an ASIC like sha, AMD would be the only company capable of producing competitive chips...
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:20:42

Do you actually believe what you're saying? Or are you trolling? ... Validating blocks != Mining/creating blocks. Consumer hardware validates blocks just fine given the current consensus.

Answer is right there - miners don't need to do anything different to enable LN once segwit is activated. LN tx are bitcoin tx. Miners enforce nothing they aren't already enforcing.
Okay... consider 2 exchanges with a peering agreement that decide to offer instant tx for customers. This is how LN starts - 2 major exchanges start offering secure 0 conf inter-exchange transfers. Then other people peer with them. And the network grows from there.
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:28:04
Is it?  Not in my dictionary... How does needing to pay higher fees to use the service impact the core functions of bitcoin? Hint: it doesn't.

You haven't demonstrated XSS... XSS with this technique wouldn't work in most (all I know of) modern browsers (try loading a script from another domain instead of just adding msgboxes).  Furthermore, it only seems to impact your user account, and affecting others is typically neccesary to consider something vulnerable to XSS.
Still.. it's a bit worrying that the company isn't doing input sanitizing, and I would be concerned about what other vulnerabilities may exist if their devops are this lazy.

Sounds like the way to run a testnet or altcoin maybe.
As for future bcash forks... we'll see. TransFlex is an often talked about highly incomplete implementation of a new tx format; it has a long way to go before it's ready for production. Bcash also already implemented the segwit signature scheme as a tx format modification in the initial fork, so upgrading the tx format again doesn't seem all that likely. 
As for bcash forking again to increase blocksize... they are accumulating WAY less then 1MB/10min of tx and will almost certainly continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  We'll see if bcash ever even gets close to maxing out their 8MB blockcap.

If you don't merge the outputs later, there wouldn't be anyway to link them via blockchain analysis. Beware of SPV/light clients tho - using bloom filters to check balances exposes the relationship between addresses to whatever host you connect to.

You're being an idiot talking about LN here tho, when the topic is bitpay is forcing a terrible BIP down users throats.

Great thing about graphs and charts is you can trim them to suit your argument.

Not really... just don't push your tx to the p2p network. You can still include them in your blocks. Your block could get orphaned and the tx used, but that's going to be rare.
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:33:32
They could, but you're just talking about hypotheticals; in practice, they don't, and likely wouldn't.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:07:34
Minority vs Majority chain in a split doesn't matter at all if something if a soft-fork or a hard-fork.  Blacklisting a block is never a hard-fork; it is a restriction of the rules not an expansion, and so by definition it is a soft-fork.
But otherwise, totally.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:27:24
But it's not as covert and you'd miss out of fees for segwit tx.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:31:14
it rescans when you just replace the wallet.dat ?
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:38:11
Not really... Actually, not at all. I've never had a stuck transaction even during extremely high volume periods.
I wonder if blockchain's wallet is "buggy" on purpose....
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:42:33
Yes, I am. By trade and otherwise.
So segwit sucks, but using segwit code in BCH was okay? Explain that logic please...
What are those disadvantages exactly? Are you sure they are actually introduced by the patches?  Curious what you have to say here.

No! This is so terribly wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:06:47


Agreed - but I can assure you not all of the time and not all miners.  Afterall, it's in the miner's best interest to include the transaction that pays a higher fee.
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:51:50


Ah, by that I meant that there would be no need to "move" or spend your coins to new address/seed because a hardware wallet fails.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:12:58
The merkle root for the witness is in the coinbase tx. You can't mine on a block without that info.

@_date: 2018-06-06 17:23:25
That's exactly what the OP is talking about tho.
I have ... 6 hardware wallets on my desk.  But only one is init'd with my current seed.  OP is talking about having 2 hardware wallets, both init'd, one as "backup."  Doesn't make sense - a backup should NOT be a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:01:51
It's not keeping them. It's having them init'd with your seed. That's just stupid...  And thinking of them as "backups" is even more so.  A seed backup is fireproof at a minimum.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:32:54
Was it the change from the .01 transaction?  I suspect that some miners who will mine 0 fee transactions care about the age out the inputs. Accepting 0 fees and caring about priority (age) are both legacy things, so it makes sense they would go together.

Definitely not a correct assessment of the current tax situation. You only report gains from BTC when they are realized (you convert to fiat), and never need to report ownership of bitcoin nor most other property to a tax authority.

Makes no sense. If you mined BTC and bought BCH, you made more then mining BCH directly. Your logic is flawed - mining BTC was more profitable at the end of the day.

Totally. There are ways to do it. The point is, you can't just tell someone to send their bitcoin to shapeshift to xmr to xmr to xmr ro shapeshift to bitcoin and expect the coins to be anything but less anonymous.

Heh, dollar cost averaging is quite simple.  You buy a fixed $ amount periodically (say, $100 every paycheque). By doing so, you average-out the dollar-cost of your purchases over a period of time.
To buy coins, you need to use an exchange (or Bitcoin ATM linked to an exchange, or a person say from localbitcoins that will trade in person). Best bet for a noob, IMO, is to buy a hardware wallet like Nano S or Trezor (make sure you write down your seed and never lose it!), find a local exchange that takes payment in a convenient way for you, and just start buying a small bit with every paycheque and transfering it to your hardware wallet.
Running a bitcoin core node is probably FAR overkill for you at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:16:40
The fork block happened ages ago...
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:17:32
The fork already happened... mainnet launch of BTG is just coming, which almost certainly will have no negative impact on BTC, infact likely a positive one.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:51:50
If Tether affects all crypto with 0.25% of the total crypto marketcap, it's going to be a pretty damn tiny impact on BTC. I can survive a 1-10% hiccough in the markets, can't you?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:57:24
The original bcash chain in unkillable. I called this when they first announced the EDA - by design, a clean hard fork away from EDA is litterally impossible.
Keep in mind, ETC didn't have exchange support right away either. Expect mess here just like that split, where some exchanges lose all their Clashic due to replay, etc.

Which is posted publicly with all other shapeshift TX, along with amount.  Can you seperate the XMR input and output easily? Sure. Can you make sure shapeshift doesn't put 2 and 2 together? That's a lot harder, and the answer isn't "Monero."
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:06:01
You can make your own paper wallet with a printer and an offline computer.  Then you transfer the funds from coinbase to your paper wallet address.

You could use both as multi-sig with electrum. 2 of 3 multisig with 3 different brands of hardware wallet is a great way to protect against problems with any one device. (Electrum's dev Thomas suggested this to me a while back as a way to hedge against the different hardware wallet companies) .

bc1 is a native segwit address (most space efficient, but not well supported yet). Addresses starting with 3 are P2SH, and it is possible to wrap a segwit address in a P2SH address (it costs more space, actually slightly more then just a normal P2SH tx due to the wrapper, but benefits from the witness discount and full compatability with existing systems).
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:26

@_date: 2017-11-09 05:19:53
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:47:21
Yes, that's the /s = sarcasm. If there was a way to exchange to and from monero without going thru a centralized exchange, it could be viable. But every single shapeshift tx is public, for example.
It's doable, kinda, but it's not as simple as using changelly or shapeshift back and forth and mixing a few times on the XMR network.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:01:49

2X doesn't have any hashrate support messure or signaling mechanism at all. 2X is a flag day hard fork. The btc1 client forces a fork at a given block height, regardless of anything else.
BIP91 required 80% support to activate the orphaning of non-segwit-signaling blocks, but no blocks were ever orphaned as 100% of hashrate was signaling segwit already.
2X has nothing to do with BIP91 really. 2X has no relationship to the number 80%.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:49:39
Not quite. Coinbase has to report even someone who bought $20000/52 worth of bitcoin every week, because it adds up to $20k in the year. Reporting requirements for cash transactions are daily and weekly, never additive over a longer period.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:44:22
No need to carry the hardware wallet with you to receive funds.  You would use included (or 3rd party like electrum) software to see receive addresses and spend funds (spending funds requires you to enter a pin and verify the transfer with your hardware wallet's screen and buttona).  When you meet someone in person to buy, you could have only the receive address on you, and then verify the transaction on a public blockexplorer. Meanwhile your private keys are safe on your hardware wallet at home.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:45:29

You think when the attack comes from a nation state, the corrupt CEOs who pushed for 2X won't capitulate to benefit themselves?  2X basically proved they will.

@_date: 2017-04-22 08:16:52
I would say that specifically in terms of proof of work, an optimization involves testing more nonces for less power.  ASICBoost does not do this.   It cheats the system by re-using nonces.  The job of a miner under bitcoin PoW is to test nonces.  ASICBoost doesn't test more nonces or use less power to test the same number of nonces.
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:55:00

Sure, I can agree with that summary.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:54:13
You seriously don't know that the shapeshift API publishes every exchange tx? Damn lol. There is nothing private about it.
How can they be linked? Amounts and locations for starters. Heck, even if you are using tor but not a full relay node, it would be technically possible to link your in and out tx.
Sure, use a different in and out exchange service, just hope they aren't sharing information. Use tor (always run a relay node) to hide your location, just make sure you force a new route between in and out tx, divide into multiple out payments to prevent amount cross-reference etc etc.  And so again, the point is, the answer to anonymous coins is NOT "trade to monero and back" - it's much more complicated.

Looks like he was right. F2pool's last 3 blocks signal segwit and are flagged for 8MB.
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:41:31
Luke-jr has proposed increases starting in 2024 and scaling up to 32MB... so I don't know why you think he's against scaling on-chain soon... 6.5 years is fairly "soon" for one of the most conservative opinions on the topic, and that's what he's okay with RIGHT NOW.
As development moves forward (if it can...) luke-jr might well see a faster timelime as reasonable.
@_date: 2017-04-23 21:44:53
Actually, it's somewhat public how to use overt ASICBoost (version bit shuffling) at least.  Antpool stratum even supports it (method name: multi-version) .  But, the tech behind finding collisions for covert ASICBoost via merkle-tree mixing is not available publicly (and would only really be useful to very large solo-miners, or a pool with a lot of participating miners).

@_date: 2017-04-18 07:45:10
But that's what happens ... segwit comes with a blocksize increase by discounting witnesses. Anyone using segwit tx will actually free up blockspace, and LN channels free up blockspace to an even greater extent by merging many small transactions into one on-chain tx. We'll have larger blocks the more LN/segwit is used.
A hard-fork for block-size absolutely makes sense. But we don't need it yet... if segwit wasn't being blocked by covert ASICBoost miners, we'd still have low fees today.  Why rush a hard-fork?
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:39:06
Yes they are. Note tho, 2MB Blocks != 2MB hard-fork.

@_date: 2017-04-05 22:24:40
Segwit was on the table and ready to activate before any extended periods of the mempool being bloated.  Even now, blocks aren't actually full on average and backlogs eventually get cleared. So, suggesting that it took "too long" to provide a blocksize increase via segwit is nothing short of ignorant FUD.
Been chewing the Roger nonsense today eh?
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:20:32
100% agree btw. I personally like the idea of Luke-jr's recent proposal that scales gradually by pre-decided algorithm. Got a lot of flack for starting at a smaller blocksize if activated immediately, but that didn't really seem like an issue since miners would be unlikely to signal the BIP until is was actually an increase. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:05:03

Not with segwit... a LN node doesn't need to have high uptime because others can monitor for commitments of a old channel states. Without segwit a LN node would always need to be online, which is a major reason it sucks without segwit.

Bitcoin is at an all time high market cap. Nice FUD.  Market dominance is not market cap. You're just talking about bitcoin maximalism. Bitcoin is not the solution to everything, nor should we try to make it into one.
People will call you a troll if you write stuff like this, and you should expect it.
To your points:
1. Misleading/false - see above.
2. Bitcoin is extremely young for a financial product; are you really worried about volatility? Volatility will be inevitable for a while, albiet it is slowly declining
3. Transaction fees have increased; transaction times have remained exactly the same.
4. Yes, there are many altcoins. None of them even need scaling solutions - none of them are anywhere close to that well used, supported, and distributed.
Anyway, now we all know the only reason Bitmain is blocking segwit is because they have a covert mining advantage.

@_date: 2017-04-06 21:37:40
Note tho, that empty blocks are very likely a signal of ASICBoost usage, because in the event you can't find collisions quickly enough by adjusting the merkle tree, you can generate more likely collisions by using an empty transaction tree.  
Specifically when you consider it is only Bitmain-related pools that create empty blocks, the other possible reasons like headers-first mining seem a lot less likely.

ASICBoost is ASICBoost.  You can spin the merkle root to find collisions, or you can spin the block version number. Covert/Overt doesn't mean much, those terms just make it a bit easier to understand the issue.

It's not possible to implement segwit as a soft-fork without breaking covert ASICBoost. 
No, people definitely aren't okay with ASICBoost. But if overt ASICBoost (changing block version bits) can be encouraged instead, it brings ASICBoost out into the open and might stop miners blocking network development.  Plus, once it's out into the open it's still trivial to block that if it's a problem.

Existing use cases like spending funds? Wait... that's definitely supported.
Segwit is absolutely a blocksize increase. You can argue semantics about variables names until you are blue in the face, but segwit still offers larger blocks.

It's a slow war for people's minds. Many strong BU supporters saw the light and left the community, deleted their accounts, etc after ASICBoost revelations.  Sure, a smoking gun would be nice - if you find one make sure to share.  You're never going to convince everyone, but you probably don't need to. The average people who forever wants to buy coffee on-chain I bet hold very little bitcoin and no hashrate.
Obviously Core devs have had this info about Bitmain for some time. That it is a very logical reason for blocking segwit is what was more recent.
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:49:07
This is so ignorant. This is a crytographic attack not an optimization. No more nonce's are tested, instead part of the algorithm is bypassed.
The covert variant (shuffling the merckle tree) blocks almost every scaling upgrade suggested to date (with the exception of extension blocks, which were long ago dismissed due to numerous problems).
Meanwhile, ASICBoost provides absolutely no benefit to the network, decreases the effective hash strength, and again... prevents those scaling implementations.

You just described a UASF - "Miners that support Segwit simply start mining under Segwit," just add economic nodes to that to.  That's called a flag day and is indeed exactly what UASF describes and means.
There is nothing about that which is a hard-fork. A hard-fork is a backwards incompatable change to the protocol that breaks forward compatability for nodes.   If old nodes still work and follow the chain, it's a soft-fork.

I think you missunderstand the "anyone can spend" thing. Once we assign that operator to segwit, it will never be the "anyone can spend" operation again.
There is no corner to paint into... you are imagining things. As an aside, a hard-fork will almost certainly be neccesary eventually and shouldn't be feared, but rushing towards a hard-fork is probably the worst idea.

He's saying that economic nodes matter based on their economic weight. If exchanges all start backing UASF, then there's no way for the original chain to win. An economic node isn't just a network node, it's an entity that controls a not insignificant amount of value on the network.

A UASF would clearly not work without at least a decent amount of hashrate behind it. Consider, if no economic node will accept a non-UASF block, then those miners can't get paid... the reverse doesn't apply as long as ~50% of hashrate is behind the UASF chainn

@_date: 2017-04-18 23:04:29
No... for 2 reasons: 
- anyone can spend transactions don't currently exist on anyway... using them would be crazy and throwing away money for fun.
- unupgraded nodes see the original meaning of the operation, sure. They see ab anyone can spend tx of course, because they don't understand witness commitments. But that doesn't matter - they can't spend them once the soft-fork activates because no other node will accept their transaction. And once a soft-fork passes, there is a 2 week period before it activates.  During those 2 weeks, enough block weight is built on top of the activation that forking the chain to deactivate is quite litterally impossible even if you used most of the computing power in the world.


It's pure FUD and/or misunderstanding.
TLDR: Once soft-fork locks in and activates successfully, there is no such thing as the old Anyone Can Spend. That operator doesn't exist - replaced with another meaning forever.

Not really... the whole point of a hardware wallet is to have a seperate minimal stack that is not connected to the internet and so cannot ve attacked.
You could use an airgapped pi to hold private keys and sign transactions I guess, but it wouldn't be seemless like a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:13:29
Not true. The cost is artificial and not a network fee. If bitpay is doing unnecessary UTXO sweeps (they are) and trying to pass them off as network fees, that is fraud. That is a business expense due to poor design, not a network fee. And it's highly unlikely that "fee" is actually directly handed to miners.

Fiat currency control aside, banks are there to make transactions possible that otherwise wouldn't be.  This is why people have crypto visa cards, etc.  Bitcoin can't replace existing financial systems over night, so it also has to work with them.
As for inflated loans... well, derivative schemes and quasi-fradulent security bundles are kind of a seperate topic.

One is supported by resources external to the blockchain, the other is supported by internal resources. PoW can provide more security as cost to attack is determined by something seperate from market cap. In PoS, your risk in performing an attack is always less then what could possibly be double-spent or otherwise stolen.

Depends what you mean by "all transaction information." You could technically, with segwit, never download the witness merkle tree, and still have all the transaction info, just no witness. Could run a node capable of showing all relevent tx info while never needing &gt;1MB/block.
This said, of course segwit is a blocksize increase.

Only a hard-fork causes an inevitable chainsplit. BIP148 and non-BIP148 nodes will resolve to the same chain if the BIP148 chain ever gains more weight.

@_date: 2017-07-13 05:36:36
July 21st period isn't comparably dangerous ... segwit activation via segwit2x (bit 4 signaling before enforcing bit 1 signaling) or BIP9 activation can't cause a chain split. UASF WILL cause a chain split, at least temporarily.
Edit: ok, ok; there isn't _no_ danger. My point was that there isn't a risk of a chainsplit, and small re-orgs aren't a big concern IMO, given we should know to expect the possibility around that time.

Thank-god we have BIP148 since it forced segwit2x's hand to getting segwit out the door this month. It's 100% the only reason that is happening - see git issues on btc1 for proof.
Segwit2x is very litterally miner voted BIP148 - upon activation (btc1/segwit2x via miner vote, BIP148 UASF via a flag day) all blocks not signaling on bit1 for segwit will be orphaned.

Quote from the agreement:
"We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit."
They released a pull request -the "recommendation."  And miners didn't follow thru and activate segwit.
Miners also promised: "We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future."  and then several went back on their word almost immediately.
If you grab a copy of Black's law dictionary of similar, you'll discover your interpretation of "We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core" is not correct.  That can be legally interpreted as, "we will run segwit before such a hard-fork is released in core."  Which we're still waiting for... This meaning is highly clear even to a lay-person if you take it in context - the agreement starts "We will continue to [...] develop [...] a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit" - clearly it's impossible to base anything on the experience we gain from segwit without activating it first...

This is highly un-true.
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:51:17
But at bit 4 activation at least 80% should be signaling bit 1, since everyone signaling bit 4 will also be signaling bit 1, and some not signaling bit 4 will signal bit 1... So, small (statisically likely max of 2 blocks isn't it?) re-orgs are possible if you're using a non-enforcing client.
This doesn't really matter, and cannot cause a lasting chain split like I said.
I'm not a fan of this whole orphaning otherwise valid blocks to force the existing segwit deployment, but it doesn't seem likely to go wrong if miners actually enforce what they say they are (a big if, admitedly).

Think how powerful and strong that makes their business look if they just pop back up like nothing happened when one of their seemingly core admins was arrested and domain seized by overzealous 'mericans.  We've seen plenty of sites in the past get domains seized only to popup under a non-.com name again.

Hum... segwit2x is designed so if 80% of miners signal for it, signaling for regular-old-segwit is FORCED - that is, any block not signaling readiness for segwit will be orphaned. This causes the current segwit deployment to activate. Because it is activated by supermajority miner vote, a chain split longer then a few blocks is impossible, and the fork will always resolve towards the segwit chain. So, no chainsplit possible.
UASF BIP148, however, will activate whether there is majority miner support or absolutely no miner support.  A chain split will happen, and persist forever if the BIP148 chain does not have more weight then the non-BIP148 chain.  It will resolve into one chain if and only if the BIP148 gains more hashrate then the non-BIP148 chain.  This is why it is dangerous to transact around Aug 1st because if the BIP148 chain is not the longest initially, the other chain could be dominant for a while and then completely wiped out if the BIP148 chains gets to a higher blockweight.
That help at all?

Most miners running core are probably compiling their nodes from source anyway, not using prebuilt and non-platform optimized binaries. Adding the PR before building is trivial.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:59:06
Just move them from GDAX to coinbase?  Or are there limits on that too?
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:26:11
Miners lose a lot of fact/power if they allow a forking change to be pushed thru without their "vote."  A UASF activation of segwit would fix the narative on BIP9 back to "signaling" instead of voting.
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:46:39
When you trace those tx back, it starts from a coinbase cold storage wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:14:15
Only partially true. The BIP9 segwit deployment on bit 1 does end on a given date, not block height.

The article doesn't say building more roads is bad. We want more people driving. But, we can't expect adding more lanes will stop the back-log of cars. And tolls will be the same no matter how big the roads get.
Segwit's capacity increase is also specifically designed to encourage cars to drive more efficiently.

So, the past determines the future eh? That's the most ignorant presumption you can make.

Who cares? Segwit2x activates segwit via BIP91. BTC1 team didn't invent this... There is a BIP91 patch against core you can run that will activate segwit the same as the BTC1 codebase will.
Nobody is going to switch to the btc1 code long term.  BTC1 team still needs core to do all the development so they can fork and patch in a few changes lol.

Core doesn't support BIP148... wtf are you talking about?
*the boogey man guys! It's the core boogey man!*
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:45:29
You really shouldn't say UASF without BIP148, since BIP148 is unlike any UASF seen before, it makes your literal statement very incorrect.  Everything upgrade fork used to be by UASF. Only very recently did BIP9 signaling start being used, and the author of it has appologized for his mistakes that caused a lot of this mess with miners thinking they get to "vote."
The point I was making is unrelated tho - BTC1 implemented the segwit activation EXACTLY the same as BIP148. The only difference between segwit via segwit2x or segwit via UASF BIP148 is that the miners get to "vote" on the former and therefore save some face.  Both will have the exact same effect if activated, one just activates by miner signaling and the other by a flag date.
Not sure how BIP148 is a joke when Segwit2X literally uses the same mechanism to activate segwit lol.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:15:55
I think you can choose either as long as you are consistent.
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:45:50
They upped the gas limit a bit. Any kind of real contract load still brings the network to a standstill tho.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:13:16
Except Jared is wrong as bit 4 had meaning before segwit2x.  Bit 4 = BIP91 segwit activation.  It has nothing to do with the NYA hardfork.
Oh yes, we're going to scrap the hard-fork.  GOooood luck if you think you can cram that down our throats.
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:06:19
Probably because of segwit2x... if we don't see segwit2x activate segwit, I would expect miner support to start popping up rappidly.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:05:44
Segwit2x is very litterally BIP148 activated by miner vote. You need to get your head examined if you think UASF BIP148 is a joke.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:24:48
None at all. Miners could have run BIP148 and it would so the EXACT same thing as BIP91 in Segwit2x...
The uacomment before signaling to signal is exactly so miners can save face and extend the idea that BIP9 is a vote.

@_date: 2017-07-15 16:53:13
You do realize SegWit2X and BIP148 have the EXACT same method of activating segwit on bit 1, and are compatible with each other?  The only difference is in SegWit2X the miners get to save face a bit by signaling/"voting" with bit 4.
BitcoinABC can split off ASAP please.  ChinaCoin/JihanCoin is nothing to fear.

Ya, it's a pretty interesting idea I'd agree. As long as replay protection is there, it would work out pretty well.

I am definitely looking forward to what other evidence has been uncovered.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:43:43
The number of inputs and outputs in the tx matters most. e.g. spending one output to one output would be smallest. Adding a change output increases the size. Adding any additional inputs or outputs does so further.

@_date: 2017-07-13 17:16:20
Signaling is usually hardcoded by miners into their stratum servers, and although supposed to be representive of what features their node will validate, can be set to anything at all.
Miners need to run btc1 or in another way reject blocks nor signaling for segwit on bit 1, if bit 4 signaling hits 80%.
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:38:20
That's what segwit2x enables... with a 2MB base blocksize (really, there is no such thing as a 2MB limit anymore tho....) you could have a block up to 8MB given adversarial conditions (which is something you should always assume with Bitcoin).

Yes, you can. Or you can add a ton of useless junk to the coinbase tx. The fact this isn't part of the specification shows the general incompetance of the btc1 team pretty much as well as their failure to set default options so a &gt;1MB block can even be mined!  If everyone ran the btc1 code as is, the chain would get permanently stuck at the fork block...

@_date: 2017-07-14 15:14:59
I'd say the BTC1 code for segwit deployment is quite well tested and understood (the hard-fork code, maybe not so much).  This is a changeset that was developed with the intent of being easily merged back into core and touching a minimal amount of code.  BU is a shit-show that changed stuff all over the place without good reason, and in some cases the absolute WRONG reasons.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:20:59
I don't think so... Jihan, Roger, CW, and the like have all talked about not needing as many nodes, that less nodes would be fine, etc.  That's more centralization period.  "Good" maybe not, but they seem to see it as a worthy tradeoff.
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:46:35
There's not any active talk about implementing segwit as a hardfork... so, no...

It's a good representation of bitcoin users tho. Sure, not everyone can vote; but don't you think if every verified coinbase user voted it would ve quite representative of the wider bitcoin user community?
@_date: 2017-07-13 07:17:39
Not sure about most likely, but yes, absolutely - if segwit2x activates before Aug 1st, then BIP148 clients won't do anything special. This is exactly why segwit2x was designed like this - so miners can save face by voting on basically running a miner enforced BIP148 lol, while avoiding a chainsplit from BIP148.
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:37:01
Gotcha - explains everything if you don't think ASICBoost is behind the reason to block segwit.  No sense ever discussing anything with you further if you're that blind.
I said Coin Dance's weighting is arbitrary. I never said anything about inaccuracies. You're just putting words in my mouth now.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:55:08

@_date: 2017-07-13 18:40:14
Sure - makes sense when you consider the short window and possibility of miners changing signaling or going online/offline, or false signaling.
Still, if it's close to 80%, the potential disruption seems minimal.  I'm presuming we'll be well over 80% signaling bit 1, and many stragglers will join or stop mining fairly quickly.  That presumption could absolutely be wrong, however, seems highly likely.
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:18:18
It's pretty fair... bigger blocks, lower fees, more centralization vs btc now (self-soveirgn where no signed agreement by corporations has ever made a change to the network).

2. You can't really "fake signal" a uacomment flag, since it's effectively meaningless anyway. Nowhere does it say that NYA means they must run segwit2x later.

So true... so true. 
The way people interpret the HK agreement is absurd too. "Expected' was a huge word in the statement about 2MB. And community consensus is specifically mentioned.  "By the time" also means before when you look it up in a law dictionary, so if Core introduced hard-fork code before miners activated segwit, it's the miners that would be breaking the agreement.

It doesn't. He's wrong. It's possibly a very dangerous fork if hashrate favours the non-BIP148 chain initially but then shifts towards the BIP148 chain. We could see a re-org of almost literally infinite size at any point if the BIP148 chain gains comparatively more weight.
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:32:42

@_date: 2017-07-14 05:48:34
The weight numbers are clearly arbitrary.  The key is that there are only really 3 entities opposed to segwit when you go thru the list: Jihan, Roger, and BTCPOP.
Basically everyone else either supports segwit or is neutral.
Chances are BTCPOP was purchased by someone like Jihan also... old CEO/owner left a bit over a year ago, and their tune changed promptly. Can you say, "buying the company with the most weight on coindance that is available for purchase?"

Probablty the worst thing is its use of the term, "the Bitcoin devs" in ridiculous ways.
Other issues I noted on a quick secons glance:
- Segwit removes the 1MB cap and replaces it with blockweight. There is no 1MB or 2MB anymore.
- Generalizes tx counts in a block terribly; 1000, 2000, etc..
- Suggests that a hard-fork will always result in two blockchains; something that is honestly ridiculous. The article itself argues against this idea IMO.
- Suggests bitcoin won't survive if the 2x fork fails
- "Majority of the community supports [segwit2x]." ??? What?
I could pick it apart for ages, but see no reason to do so. The idea was fine, but it's very poorly stated.

BIP91 is just a bunch of miners voting to do exactly what BIP148 does.  If you believe the NYA signaling, then there should be no difference at all between BIP91 and BIP148 except when they start orphaning the non-bit1-signaling blocks.
If you don't believe the NYA signaling, then there isn't any reason to believe the bit 4 signaling for BIP91 either, and a chain split is definitely possible.
Not to mention the activation window is very small. As little as 60% of real hashing power could activate BIP91 due to variance.  Then if 10% from that 60% is fake signaling,  you have a chain split.

That still doesn't have anything to do with holding bitcoin private keys and therefore being able to obtain bitcoin cash tho?  BCC isn't an ICO, it's a planned fork of the bitcoin blockchain with different rules.  Presuming bitmain or their partners go thru with creating the BCC chain, that is.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:55:57
Yup. And it's not where you seem to think.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:39:27
Yup, that could make sense.  Sweeping private keys wasn't something btc-e offered publicly, but might have offered to a select few who needed it.

@_date: 2017-07-30 02:51:49
Here's what you're missing: every other coin/chain is going to run into similar or worse scaling problems. Just look at how badly the Ethereum network performed under moderate tx load.

BIP44 format maybe?
Remember how the wallet was created?

Massively different. Not to mention majority of existing seed nodes aren't affiliated with blockstream, its employees, or contractors.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:51:48
Blockstream branching into distributed storage maybe?
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:43:14
Correct. If you don't implement it as a soft-fork with the second merkle root in the coinbase tx, it doesn't break covert (merkle-tree-spinning) ASICBoost.

You know a plan is already in place if hashrate isn't high enough to activate segwit, right? It's called PoW change.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:51:16
Ya, Bitmain doesn't use it... but they probably exclusively license it to a few people.

Pretty sure 2 people running seed nodes from the new list said EXACTLY that they wouldn't follow the policy in the PR...
But uhhhoookkkaayyy. Ifff you saayyy sooo... riiiightmmm?
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:01:06
It's not less risky in adverserial conditions tho. BIP91 can cause a chain split and long re-orgs just like BIP148.  There's no reason NYA signers couldn't have just picked a flag date like BIP148.  Signaling on bit4 accomplishes nothing at all - either you can believe the NYA signaling, or you can't.
Bit 4 is entirely about miners saving face and perpetuating the idea that they get to 'vote' on stuff.
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:19:41
Dunno... it takes some vision to build something like bitcoin. Experiment, absolutely.

Lightning and sidechains exist and are fully functional now...
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:24:26
"Average people" can't use bitcoin at all right now... maybe a bitcoin exchange but not the network itself.  Absolutely most bitcoin users should be capable of setting up a lightning channel and sending money back and forth at this point. On bitcoin mainnet? No, we don't have segwit yet... on litecoin or testnet, no problem. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:09:12
Very much agreed. Informed is best - thank-you for the considered rhetoric as always.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:08:08
Word games... NYA only says they will reduce the threshhold for activation of segwit, but not that they have to actually signal...
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:39:47
Presumably they are going to signal segwit before BIP91 starts orphaning blocks... It's pretty weird they wouldn't just signal both bits at once tho, agreed.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:12:58
A lack of replay protection did not cause ETC to trend to $0.  Making replay protection optional is just a way of making segwit adoption more of a pain in the ass on the main chain.  Can't just have simple sweeps into P2WSH addresses, have to think about replay protection.
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:22:16
I've read this comment a few times and I can't seem to understand, what benefit would they gain, being serious, in waiting until after segwit launched to complain about its legality?  I feel like I'm missing something here...
I will saytho, nothing in the OP article seemed worth reading... Except maybe to judge what nChain is and a bit of what coindesk is starting to allow published...
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:36:19
You're talking about BIP148, not segwit2x
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:45:45
No... BIP148 can wipeout the legacy chain at any time if it gets more weight. So extending the BIP148 chain would only serve to attack the main chain.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:09:49
Or just block all US IPs.
@_date: 2017-07-14 03:53:15
Well, BIP91 activation of segwit (which btc1 is using) is fairly well understood. If there is majority miner support (which will be the case if it activates), then small to moderate re-orgs (a few blocks long) are possible until almost all miners are signaling segwit.
Since not signaling segwit (bit 1) after bit 4 lock-in would mean losing any earned block rewards, it seems likely that if we get 80% of miners signaling on bit 4 and bit 1, then it won't take all miners long to be signaling bit 1. It's technically possible a bunch of miners will signal bit4 but not bit1, which would cause huge issues, and amount to an attack on the chain IMO.
Now, it's also possible a bunch of miners using BU or other non-segwit clients will false signal just so their blocks don't get orphaned. This will mean that when segwit deployment activates (~2 weeks after lock-in IIRC), we might end up with orphaned blocks and re-orgs again as the fake signaling miners produce blocks invalid under the segwit soft-fork.
In summary, I'd just say to expect small or moderate re-orgs over the next while, and don't consider funds confirmed until you have a LOT of confirmations. Note tho that with BIP148 on Aug 1st there is a chance that even hundreds of confirmations may not suffice if the non-BIP148 chain gets overtaken after an extended period.
Edit: a few typos

The first LN payments were made shortly after segwit was active on LTC... With litecoin's smaller network effect, it's reasonable that a meaningful network topology will take a while to appear. But, instant tx between exchnages shouldn't be far off - need to develop some inter-exchange agreements first.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:14:40
Thanks =)  just found that site yesterday and couldn't remember the name this morning.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:33:02
No need for block scaling on litecoin yet, since it has a lot less transaction volume and has 4x the capacity due to faster blocktime.  The race for cheaper tx will surely push people to show segwit addresses on bitcoin given the current network state, don't you think?
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:27:19
That's what I said... bitcoin is not taxed.  Spending bitcoin is taxed, because it's a barter transaction of an equivalent fiat value, and exchanging bitcoin for fiat is taxable.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:22:34
Agree about hoping it is true.  It's not weird they aren't discussing what it going on tho - btc-e has never been knowing for a lot of (or really much of any) communication.
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:33:52
... try actually reading the Hong Kong agreement. They never said they'd fork the blocksize and implement it in core.  And Luke followed thru and wrote code as was promised. Meanwhile, multiple miners backed out of the agreement almost immediately.
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:30:47
LN routing may not be complete, but payment channels using segwit are 100% functional. This allows, for example, 2 exchanges to transact between each other with instant confirmation and bundled/smaller fees.  Is this possible without segwit? Kinda... but it's significantly more complicated to implement securely, and unlike with segwit, the software isn't ready yet.
With segwit on litecoin, you can use payment channels right now.

Calling litecoin a fork of bitcoin is quite disingenous. The codebase is a fork, yes, but the chain isn't a fork.  You're treating chain forks and codebase forks as the same thing when they are drastically different.

Not really true - a non-segwit utxo can be spent to a segwit output and immediately gain the space benefit.  It is as immediate as people change the address format they send to.

"Bitcoin" isn't taxed.  Profits (capital gains) in terms of fiat on ownership of bitcoin is taxable.  You can't tax something that isn't legal tender unless it it being actively used as an equivelent or substitute for legal tender.

Totally wrong... the inital sync is tiny compared to the TB+ of upload bandwidth my full node uses every month. You only ever run a node with terrible upload bandwidth or something?  Try running a real node with real peer counts that is actually helping the network.


This is just stupid.  Bitcoin dominance in terms of market cap is simply a ridiculous thing to consider when most coins could have their value dropped to 0 by a single large holder dumping in the market.  Besides, most of that value is due to the Ethereum ICO bubble happening right now, and that's going to pop any time.
