Interesting write up. Since we are talking China + Crypto here does anyone know how cozy VeChain is with the communist party? I have heard speculation that they wouldn’t be allowed to operate at this level unless they were somehow working with the state. I have also heard they work from outside of China so this doesn’t apply. My understanding is that they are very Chinese and I would really like to know if they are in bed with this shit regime.

It’s more likely you got in mid-late 2017 and haven’t realized that some people don’t value their wealth/holdings in USD or any other fiat. Some choppiness on a few mostly manipulated exchanges actually doesn’t matter to them.

Fair enough but it’s at least tangentially related and I think Bcash finally imploding will bring some people back to Bitcoin. I can’t really ask it in the other sub and expect to real answers so I asked here.

It means buy a bit now.. and slowly as the price moves being patient enough to average down to the target price you have in mind. This can prevent you from FOMOing in high at once, and/or missing the b oat completely.

Well it’s just that to actually have an impact quantum computers will have to be working at the pinnacle of their theoretical potential so I think this threat is dramatically overstated at this point.

Because they force citizens to use it with guns and threat of imprisonment.

Literally all this account does is post FUD in r/bitcoin.

Thank you doctor.

But... shiny!

You don’t get it. At all. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:58:32
Write tests bro,
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:47:49
False. You can create ENDLESS SHITCOINS from BTC!
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:36:39
It’s cool, when the banks close we will just use the energy they consume.

How about “not enough”

This title is so 3 hours ago.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:09:58
That’s the thing.. dude is a charlatan trying to hijack bitcoin for his and Jihan’s personal gain with no regard for how it will negatively affect the movement. It’s pants.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:22:43
I’m concerned if he loses he might stick to his word just to troll reality.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:42:34
Came here to say that. Have a pretty good idea where they got the fiat tho.
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:55:48
Bcash could attempt to solve these “issues” without misleading users and acting in a disingenuous manner. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:37:18
Underachievers, please try harder.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:30:23
I’m going to open a pizza shop next door to his house.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:06:30
I actually meant how many bitcoin have been sent to Bcash addresses on accident. I’m not sure my question made sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:29:41
Boom. Utility.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:33:52
To be fair that is a decimal point not a comma. Still, you should probably launder your money elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:23:32
This latest narrative where bcrash supporters try to sound reasonable but are still trying to gaslight everyone got old quick.. next plz. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:47:53


You seem sincere and I appreciate that, but I can’t agree with this. They have been shilling it as “the real bitcoin” for months. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:25:45
Your perm is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:18:26
I think people are frustrated with the latest disingenuous moves by bitcoin.com etc and many are protesting by not holding BCH. I won’t support that project, even for gains.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:01:56
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:13:36
I’ll meet you at Mr. Tipple’s.

You can sell it? That sux, I just dumped it for free.

So what u into? Seriously?

@_date: 2018-04-25 09:24:16
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:08:34
This is all absolutely real. Good on ya NS.
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:29:50
+1 for the desperation part. That change to Bitcoin.com calling Btrash Bitcoin and calling BTC core is just disgusting. I’m not sure where he gets this army of delusional trolls that follow this fraudulent garbage. Can’t go away fast enough IMO.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:34:02
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:37:35
This. Exactly.  Can we quantify all the Bitcoin that has been lost by newcomers that have been confused by BCash’s misleading tactics?
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:10:29
Pigs in space.
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:53:57
Hold my downvote.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:31:06
Did you actually read their history to check that? Just curious.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:57:32
Definitively pissed.
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:20:36
Why do ppl post things like this?
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:20:53
Holy Shitoshi!
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:17:05
Because it bothers ppl that the BCH community buys up domains like bitcoin.com and lies to/confuses new users. It’s a shitty thing to do and ppl here want to shine a light on it and protect bitcoin and new adopters from profiteering pirates that actively ignore consensus in favor of their own ideas and interests.
Edit: and this post is funny AF.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:29:11
They totally did that and you know it or u aren’t paying attention. It’s absolute bullshit and is fucking the greater goal. But if ur cool with that then... ok.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:32:44
Not sure what ur selling but it’s simple s&amp;d.
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:21:03
Who cares.. they’ll be back. Actually read the article. Iran citing money laundering as a reason is absurd, unless of course you decode it to: “Oppressive regime bans currency they cant control and manipulate”. I suppose this is getting old now. Apologies.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:06:57
I know, this is a new account and they haven’t even banned me yet.. wtf?
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:14:29
Because it’s harder to confiscate it if he actually holds it.
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:35:53
This seems clumsy. You sure you know what you’re getting into?
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:36:01
Coinbase is shit. They are fine ruining bitcoin to make a buck. Look elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-07-11 23:22:56
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:43:49
It’s runnier shit for sure.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:27:46
Ooooo an alchemist!
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:17:46
They will have no PoW to back them up. Silence knave.
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:59:50
This. Court should be a social agreement. It seems like in its current form court is a tool we can use in a “civil” manner as a community before going all pitchforks and torches on him/them.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:13:02
The code has to keep the miners honest which I don’t think 32mb blocks and ASICs are gonna do.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:10:17
“Why was bitcoin-abc created in the first place?” Is a question. Why did the current proponents adopt it and create a bunch of false narratives is another.
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:50:34
For some reason I joined that party when I was 12 (40 now) and I wouldn’t think of being affiliated with it now although I suppose I’m some kind of socially liberal ancap. Damn these classifications.

How do Litecoin and Monero fit in? I can’t see them being different.
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:13:46
True. Bitcoin.com listing Btrash as bitcoin is disingenuous and goes against consensus. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:02:40

Too bad about that dot com being abused just as u mention.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:57:46
I was on the fence but giving him the benefit of the doubt. Lately I wonder if the Bcash pumpers are just trying a more subtle approach. There’s definitely patterns emerging whether redditor above is an example or not.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:48:22
About to read it but it must be good since so many cashies are here with their pants on fire.

Well the limit, but not the accessible supply. Even better.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:11:03
All of those. EFF YES!
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:07:49
They prolly did it on purpose to stop the massive outpouring to crypto during this last little bull run (/s maybe?)
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:41:05
Holy shit these people are fucking criminals! At the very least lying shitballs that are literally stealing from uninitiated users.

MtGOX trustee?

Ya he’s not well suited to participate, but he also probably doesn’t understand the wins it provides technologically.

Don’t hug me I’m scared.
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:52:48
Correct answer.

“Cashies”.. nice.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:43:17
There was some solid memery along these lines during the dip,

Just. Wait.

They are purposely trying to mislead people.

I can’t take all this winning.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:06:22
I would argue the “his own creation” part just because he isn’t even technically competent enough to fork a coin by himself. The rest is gospel.
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:07:09
Who would that be? Traders that sold at a loss that will just be.. embarrassed when the next bull run comes? I think everyone else is ready for a bounce up ��
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:04:44
So it’s working as intended. Good.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:33:52
SELL and give future profits to HODLers.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:29:36
I think this guy shills the F out of shitcoins on r/cc as well. Like obnoxiously.
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:23:51
Or perhaps mail order fireworks.

Well now it won’t!

Hold my beer... We are likely about to find out.
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:20:43
Maybe you mean you ain’t got no Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:04:26
Just gouge your eyes out with a spoon. It’s about the same.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:50:27

Dude definitely bought at the peak and needs everyone else to fail so he feels better.
