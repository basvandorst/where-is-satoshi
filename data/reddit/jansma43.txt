Cryptocurrencies are like the content of the box of Pandora for crony capitalists. The crony capitalists should realize that the box of Pandora has been opened.

Bitcoin will reduce the possibilities for undesirable monetary manipulations but it will definitely not solve current inequalities.

I don't know if transaction spamming took place by Bitmain or others. The number of transactions was definitely lowered by two other causes:
1.  Because of the high fees some free faucet sites and some gambling sites have raised the minimum withdrawal limits. This will have significantly reduced the high number of small amount withdrawals from these sites.
2. Some commercial users switched to Monero, ZEC and DASH. Because of that BTC also lost some of its value to those altcoins.

We did have an urgent problem though. There were more than 100.000 transactions waiting to be confirmed and the pool was growing. Rising fees and slow confirmations were not good for bitcoin. I think because of that a lot of BTC value has leaked away to altcoins like Litecoin, Monero, ZEC and DASH.

I think the UASF threat was indeed a strong incentive for the S2X compromise. At the time of the New York Agreement however the capacity problems seemed very urgent. More than 100.000 transactions were waiting for confirmation and the transaction fees went up rapidly. To me it wasn't clear that the market would support the UASF. We will never know what would have happened.

Discussions are fine but the problem is that a healthy discussion seems impossible now. The camps are not on speaking terms anymore.

I don't understand why the community has this fierce argument. I agree that the New York Agreement was a deal among miners and they broke their own deal when they started supporting the BCH fork. Without S2X however Segwit could not have been implemented. Why not agree with 2X as well? Originally there was no 1MB upper limit but it was introduced to prevent spam payments. With the current transaction fees that reason is not valid anymore. On the other hand I don't understand who wants S2X so badly: the big blockers have BCH now and they didn't want Segwit from the start.
It seems to me that the bitcoin community stands stronger when it is united.
