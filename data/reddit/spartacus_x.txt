What do you guys think of Account Managers? I myself believe them to be a scam due to the sheer amount of comments on instagram from people who supposedly make a huge amount (usually $10k+) a week just because this account manager helped them out. And the accounts of the managers are always similar pictures a computer screen with some trade thing on it, themselves, qoutes, office, etc. And they always say to get started dm without actually telling you how their system works. Of course I guess you could have an idea of how they operate if you know what forex trading and binary options are which are usually in their bio. (I know binary is a very bad investment) . 
Of course id be happily proven wrong but I doubt I am as if something is too good to be true it usually is.

Would a gaming computer suffice for the basic needs? I know it sounds like a stereotypical 13 year old wanting to get rich quick but trust me im not 13 just being honest and asking a question as it could save money.

I was more leaning towards mining at first but the electricity rate doesnt let it happen. Investing is now what im leaning towards lol. When investing do you buy 1 bitcoin as if it were a stock or can you buy the smaller bits of a bitcoin if you dont have 10k to buy a bitcoin?

I pay $0.09 per kWh. How long does it take to mine if 9 cence an hohr cost nearly $10,000? So dont buy a miner got it. What about like the ebay link in the op $20 for renting 2 days of mining? And btw they dont send anything they just hook up to your account and send whatever you get there so it doesnt affect your energy bill
