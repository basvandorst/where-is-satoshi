Your wallet generates addresses. If you have a wallet you can create as many addresses as you want and it is a part of that wallet forever and ever. It stores the private keys to the addresses that you have generated. A wallet will give you access to all addresses and private keys. You know how you have all those credit cards, business cards, cash, ID and shit in the wallet you have in your pocket? Imagine addresses being all those items. A wallet is a container for your addresses and it's content. As long as you have access to your wallet, you have access to its content. 
Just remember to use the correct fees. Wrote down/back up all your passwords and seeds. Triple check to make sure everything is what you want it to be before you click "send."
If your bitcoins ever get stuck due to low fees, do not panic. Bitcoins don't disappear or get lost in the sense that you get lost while driving. If it gets stuck due to fees or lack thereof, it will be returned to the sending addresses after 72 hours. Remember what I tell you, young grasshoppah.

You w=have to wait for 72 hours and it will drop automatically back into your sending wallet. That is if it does not get confirmed within 72 hours.

Bitcoin is not ready for this. Maybe it'll work online but with transaction getting stuck for days and high ass fucking fees this will only make bitcoin look bad. Fucking stop it. This bullshit will only drive people away from bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-30 19:55:43
If the fate of bitcoin really rested in the hands of a small group of people, bitcoin would have scaled long ago. Because a lot of people have a say, the debate continue. 
Whether or not jihan is the problem is still to be seen. But I am stayinh away from anything with his name attached for now. It seem like if he cant have his cake and eat it too, he will stomp on it so nobody can.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:58:51
Damn. People actually being helpful to people with stuck transaction instead of trying to be a smartass.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:59:06
If what you are saying is true, link your transaction ID. Linking your transaction ID is easy, just copy and paste.

This guy is just looking to scam somebody. There so many way of selling his btc, selling entire wallet makes no sense unless he's planning to sweep wallet after it is sold.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:05:23
I have. It will go through.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:09:47
Trump is an obvious dumbass. Roger and jihad on the other hand are clearly intelligent individual. We may not agree with what they are doing now but maybe, just MAYBE, they will save our asses down the road. 
Im going to be patient and see where this goes. However, 1+ USD in fees and every other transaction getting stuck is getting way the fuck out of hand. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:04:38
Lol its not fake. A lot of people in here have had their account closed. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:22:54
I dont want to be involve in any crypto this guy is mining. 
Mine your mom if you want to mine.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:26:11
No you do not. If it does not get confirmed, it will get returned to the sending address. At which time, you can send it again with the correct fees. 
Its usually takes 72 hours for your transaction to get dropped and returned to you. Your coins will never disappear so do not worry.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:35:51

@_date: 2017-05-02 17:15:03
If you are already assuming that nobody is stupid enough to buy a wallet from you then why are you still trying to sell it? What you are trying to figure out is if they can prove that you emptied the wallet after you have sold it.
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:18:28

@_date: 2017-05-01 14:30:11
No. That does not answer why crypto is growing almost 1 billion a day. If bank deposit if halted, where is all this new money coming from? The money already in exchanges should have dried out a few days ago. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:28:01

No. You can have 100 of those and the answer would still be no. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:55:35
Im sure some do. If you cant pay for coffee with btc, then btc cant function as a payment network. It then become just a store of value.

There is no comparison. Onecoin is only giving bitcoin a bad name.
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:21:28
Thats a bad idea. I send a lot of new bitcoiners to breadwallet, and as new users, they dont know what the correct fees are. They dont even know where to look for correct fees let alone calculating the correct fees. Veteran bitcoiners, who are the minority, should use a wallet that allow for manual fee adjustment and leave breadwallet for the vast majority of us users who are not as capable.

Third section should be about how and why it could fail and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:52:09
I thought that was pretty fair......
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:02:54
Guys, guys I know what happens next. It crashes, then, someone dump 50 millions worth of bitcoins and everyone who is margin trading gets called and some fuck face becomes a millionaire after buying 10,000 bitcoins at .10 cents a piece. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:50:40
Lol those sociopath are looking to scam people in third world countries now. They are hopimg the uneducated will fall for their ponzi. As far as I know, Vietnamese are pretty bitcoin savvy.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:40:00
Should integrate other coins too. BTC fees and stuck transaction are just stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:22:46
Dude, just get breadwallet app on your phone. Sendnit there until you know what you are doing.
Always triple check an address you are sending coins to to make sure it is correct.
Why are you guys messing with bitcoin ehen you do not understand even the fundamentals of sending amd receiving? 
For what reason are you sending it to am exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:25:11
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:17:02
Contact them if it goes through. They will refund it. Otherwise, it will hey dropped and sent back to your wallet. 
It sucks but the bitcoin network is almost unuseable right now for small transaction. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:29:54
Bitcoin is still a crawling toddler. Give it time to grow into a healthy network.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:14:11
Get breadwallet app in your phone. Send to phone. Dont lose phone. Buy Trezor. Send to Trezor.

@_date: 2017-06-23 20:37:31
If you have to ask, you probably shouldnt. Its not for everyone at the moment. Buying it the easy part. Handling it is harder.

Ok. And what does he need to do to access his coins? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:52:17
He has no coins brah. Just as his website suggest. 
But that sucks though. 15 coins are a lot of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:42:24
Its normal. Your fees, or your sacrifice to the mining monopoly known as bitmain AKA jihan wu was insufficient. 
It will get dropped and returned to your wallet in 72 hours if it does not get confirmed. You will not lose it as long as you have control of the sending wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:27:52
Lol try 99%. Did they do that survey at a bitcoin convention? How the hell did they come up with 59%. There isnt 3 person in a 5 mile radius of me who knows what a blockchain is. Pffft 59%, the fuck outta here with that bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:41:28
Except now bitcoin will kill itself, thanks to jihad.

This makes it look like an MLM.

Because he has a sensationalist title to which he corrected in the comments. Knowing people, some only ever reqd the title, but I guess he knew that, thus, the title.
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:30:44
With breadwallet you can just scan private key qr code to sweep.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:32:35
Technically your coins havent left your wallet yet. In most cases, it will reappear back in your wallet within 72 hours. In extreme cases, it will reappear in your wallet in 2 weeks. You will not lose your coins if that is what you are worrying about.
Stuck transactions have been a problem relatively recently. Segwit will solve that once it is implemented.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:20:35

@_date: 2017-06-03 00:44:51
Does your wallet have the option to rescan blockchain? If it does, you should see it after r scanning.
What does block explorer say about the two address in question?
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:12:52

Is there no way to get rid of this bitmain problem? They're like the baby boomers of the crypto world. Anywhere they are involved, progress is halted. 
I hope to meet jihad woo in an alley one day.
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:44:28
Addresses do not get recycled. What do you mean delete?

To him, it left his wallet. If you have 1 btc and you sent 1 btc, your wallet will now show 0 btc. Technically it didnt leave but when people who just joined bitcoin see that their balance went from 1 to 0, the btc left. I cannot see why when people amswer stuck transaction lost they almost NEVER reassure the OP that their coins will return to their wallet. I just cant understand it. Maybe they think theyre some fucking bitcoin professional and have the right to assume the OP just KNOW that when a transaction gets dropped the coins reappear in a wallet. 
Just fucking say it, when tx gets dropped, coins get return to sending wallet. How hard is that?

I dont understand why some people dont take the few seconds to say bitcoin will be returned to sending wallet? They just mention that it will disappear from the mempool and assume someone who is new knows what happens after. I dont fucking get it. What the fuck is your problem?
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:21:27
Why not? All you need to send bitcoin anywhere is a bitcoin address....

Exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:06:06
Yup. It'll drop from the mempool and get returned to your sending wallet. That is how Happened to me a few times. Dont worry about losing it.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:41:14
I bet you 100 btc ill fuck him, his body guards, you, and your motherfucking daddy up in that alley.
So by you stupid, twisted logic, its better to have one selfish prick control mining power than to divide it into three?
You obviously have his Dick up your anus.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:59:46
