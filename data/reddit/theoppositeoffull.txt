You missed the point where I’m referring to owning a 0.15 fraction of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:33
Not when I’m holding.

Remember when 10k by Christmas seemed like a stretch?
We got there months before that.
Moving 10k a day seems far off but that could happen tomorrow.
100k/BTC wasn’t supposed to be 10 years from now, but that could be by the end of the damn year.

Sometimes Gemini is more expensive though. I️ don’t understand why it’s volitile 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:38:45
Same with gemini and it’s very annoying to me

You overlooked my point. You can own a fraction, yes. But you’re not going to make any remarkable profit owning 0.1 bitcoin. Even if it goes to $100,000 in 5 years, that return doesn’t outweigh the risk. I just don’t see bitcoin continuing  any further than 20k
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:07:34
It’s not pessimism it’s reality. There’s no chance bitcoin surpasses  20k
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:17
Dip? This is literally nothing.

Still profiting. But nowhere close to a millionaire. Which is the meat and potatoes bitcoin has been running off of. The chance to be a millionaire is the steam behind bitcoin. 
When that fades away, the hype will too.
I’m a huge supporter of bitcoin and have been since 2011, but ii can’t help but feel this way.

Sorry. Do you still love me?

Yes, but what percentage of people can afford $15,000?
I’m saying the more expensive it gets the harder it becomes for average people to AFFORD to make a profit.
