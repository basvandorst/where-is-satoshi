I hadn't checked Block Explorer in a while, they've literally started referring to Bitcoin as "the Blockstream fork" and have announced that they plan to stop supporting it entirely since it's "deprecated technology with no possible utility."
Really depressing to see yet another good company fall for the Ver/Wu scamcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:10:58
There's actually very little discussion of Blockstream here at all, especially since several other companies are now also actively working on Lightning Network tech. I see way more talk either of what Lightning Labs is doing or, even more likely, general discussion about the open source LN protocol itself.
This is way less of a shill sub than rbtc makes it out to be.

The problem is that there really isn't anyway to accomplish those two things without giving up the fundamental benefits of Bitcoin.
How do you control payment reversals? There's no good way to handle that in a decentralized manner. Hell, even in centralized situations it's almost always decided in favor of the purchaser and the seller is left out to dry (and sometimes even hit with chargeback fees). There really is no way to do that in a good manor, and I don't think there needs to be. Paper cash works just fine without any way to reverse transactions that are made with it, and if the two parties really don't trust each other then that can be handled at a higher level by an escrow service just like it is today. It shouldn't be integrated into the money directly.
As for the value, there's also no way to wave a magic wand and fix that. Anything that doesn't have it's value controlled carefully by a government will fluctuate as demand changes, look at any precious metal or any stock. Eventually, as liquidity increases and mining payouts decrease, the value of Bitcoin (or it's successor) will stabilize reasonably to a point where you can put your money in it and be reasonably confident it won't disappear overnight because a disgruntled early adopter dumped their life savings. But, as long as there are still people making giant buys and giant sells, the price will stay all over the place.

[Ronald Wayne]( was brought on by the two Steves early on (1976) to handle some administrative work. He ultimately divested only two weeks into Apple's existence, selling his 10% stake for $800 and signing an agreement to hold no further claims on the company for a further $1500. In total, he received about $10,000 in today's money.
Had he retained his shares, as of March 2017 they would have been worth $75.5 billion USD.
I tried to buy $30 of BTC back in 2014 and after an argument with a bank (I was using BitQuick), I ultimately gave up. Obviously that's way different than owning several million shares in Apple in the early days or several thousand Bitcoin pre-Gox, but the same principle applies.
[One of my favorite Vsauce videos talks about this.]( Micheal talks about how a monk who was copying hymnals used whatever unused books he could get his hands on. With our technology, we were able to view the contents of one of the books he copied over...[a previously unknown work of Archimedes that conceived the groundwork for calculus over a thousand years before Newton and Leibniz were even born]( He also mentions that an English soldier in World War I named Henry Tandey at one point saw a wounded German solider through his sights, but opted to take pity on him and didn't shoot him. That German soldier's name? Adolf Hitler.
None of us can see the future. All we can ever hope to do is try to make the right choices with the information we have available and move forward. We're all gonna screw up along the way, but we can't let our failures define who we are.
Edit: Oh, NASA also screwed up and recorded over the original moon landing tapes so all we have is the hyper-compressed version that was made for TV broadcast. This seems to be a recurring theme...

Before Gox, most people said to just leave your coins in an exchange. Web wallets and exchanges were considered just a more convenient type of wallet.

I don't believe that is correct. [IRS Notice 2014-21]( states that *mined* crypto should be treated as income, not capital gains (it's not a "gain" because you didn't buy it, you created it). Unfortunately, according to the current rules (which were not in place at the time OP mined the block), you need to report blocks in your tax return for the year you mined them.
OP needs to accountant up and make sure all this is sorted out properly, you do not want the IRS on your ass.
(I am not a lawyer or an accountant, this is not legal advice. Again, please see a professional and don't take legal advice from a CS freshman shitposting on Reddit.)
Edit: oh, and as some others pointed out, make sure you factor in your Bcash and Bgold, which should still be in your original wallet, the 55 Bcash alone is worth $75,000 at current market value

I mean...it's better than the limbo we were in, but Coinbase should be able to do much better considering their size.
Six months for Bcash support and now quite possibly a full year for SegWit support. (And yet they were raring to go to support 2x as soon as it launched...)
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:17:42
It wouldn't have been 2MB. SegWit 4MB * 2MB = 8MB.
And yes, the transaction fees are a problem. But they are only a problem because services refuse to adopt SegWit (looking at you Coinbase) and because Lightning Network is taking a bit too long to finish. Once those two things are done, theoretically Bitcoin should have more than enough capacity for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:51:32
But with SegWit, those would have ballooned to 8MB blocks as SegWit was adopted.
This way, we can get the other benefits of SegWit (malleability fix so we can roll Lightning Network) without launching ginormous blocks. SegWit also didn't require a hardfork, 2MB blocks would have.

...no? The majority of organizations are planning to rollout SegWit without a blocksize increase and will come back to the idea of 2x after we see how the network responds to straight SegWit. Additionally, the 2x fork that Bitpay is supporting does not protect against replay attacks nor does it implement the other protocol fixes that are planned to be deployed if and when we have to go for a hardfork.
And again, the fork isn't even the main issue here. It's the fact that Bitpay is deceiving people into believing that their patch enables SegWit when in actually it's voting to hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:23:01


Not this crap again. Bitcoin is ***NOT*** being sabotaged. The people who actually know how the technology works simply believe that it would be better to wait and see if high-level scaling works rather than rushing into an unsustainable block size increase.
We can trash Lightning Network and start over if it breaks. A block size increase is pretty much gonna be permanent.

Bitcoin may have been hard in the past (it really wasn't) but it's so easy now. Stick Copay on an iPhone and you can have an idiot-proof HD wallet going in five minutes. With Coinbase you can convert to USD easily and even buy with a credit card if you're willing to eat the fee, and there's tons of other exchanges servicing basically every conceivable place in the world (not to mention local traders).
I'd wager it's easier to get setup with a wallet and exchange account these days than it is to get a merchant account to run credit cards, and that's factoring in the existence of services like Square.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:04:23


Indeed. Advertising a patch as being for SegWit support and then having it actually be a vote to hardfork to 2x is shady as hell no matter what side of the debate you're on. Not to mention that fact that their "apology" heavily vilified Bitcoin Core, going so far as to call them a "rival implementation."
Bitpay needs to wake up and join the rest of the folks actually trying to solve the problem rather than continuing to push the 2x agenda that's only supported by a small subset of the community.

* The price is still too volatile, which makes merchants scared of a potential crash and customers scared of losing potential value.
* The transcation fees are still ridiculous. SegWit will help this slightly but the real solution is to get Lightning Network running. This will probably happen by the end of the year based on what I'm reading.
* And obviously there's still many merchants who don't accept it, but with integration into most of the most popular checkout solutions adoption has seen a massive increase (obviously an Amazon adoption would really help things along, we just need to keep Bitcoin in the news long enough for Jeff Bezos and the rest of the board to think it's a good idea).
As usual, wide Bitcoin adoption will only be possible once scaling is worked out, and the best bet for that right now is the Lightning Network despite what The Other Sub™ would tell you.

I mean...a Google for "bitcoin" returns Bitcoin.org as it's first result, which doesn't mention Cash anywhere on it. Even Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver's propaganda site, requires some major digging to find any info on Cash.
With only a few exchanges and wallets even supporting Cash right now, it would be really difficulty for someone to accidentally invest in Cash, even with absolutely no knowledge of Bitcoin, BCH, or the scaling debate.

Eh, I don't really agree with of the "disenfranchisement" bit in regards to IDs, I was saying that to get across the majority opinion (hence why I added the "potentially" to my statement).
That being said, I do agree with creating a national system to replace state IDs. The Social Security Card/Number system is a mess that needs to be replaced yesterday. Hopefully if we ever get national healthcare, we'll get that done at the same time.

I don't get the concern over "locking up Bitcoins." In essence, you're simply transferring them to a checking account to use for shopping. It's pretty much no different from having cold storage for your hoard and a hot wallet on your phone for day-to-day stuff.
But yeah, while LN has a good chance of solving both scaling and the zero-conf problem, it's not even close to the cool stuff you'll be able to do with it once it gets rolling. Case in point: [secure LTC &lt;-&gt; BTC cross-chain transactions]( (in essence meaning that you could eventually be able to use any LN-compatible altcoin at any BTC-accepting merchant, an amazing upgrade and a boost for both alts and BTC).
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:51:53
Luckily with SegWit finally out the door we can focus on the real innovation (and the eventual solution to the seemingly never ending scaling war): the Lightning Network.

used to have valid discussion back when XT was relevant and Mike Hearn and the original bigblocks gang were still part of the discussion but in the post-Roger Ver/Craig Wright world it's become a cesspool of T_D-level conspiracy ramblings and daily posts about people jumping ship to altcoins because Bitcoin will apparently be completely devalued the moment SegWit turns on because the entire Core team is being controlled by George Soros or something.

I disagree with a lot of stuff theymos has done, but can no longer take the moral high road like it could back in 2015. Roger Ver and friends have done everything theymos has done and more. There's no squeaky clean side in this debate, but the Core team is at least actively working to try and make things better. The other side basically just had a tantrum and decided to make their own Bitcoin with blackjack and hookers and now it's backfiring on them when people want to stick with the coin that actually, you know, *has value*.

It might be easier if you think of it as depositing funds into a checking account to spend day-to-day rather than "locking them up."
Straight Bitcoin will be like having gold or stacks of cash in a safe. LN will be like having a checking account with a debit card attached to it.

No, because Bcash has support, and thus value. If I were to fork off Nathancoin™ right now, it would exist, sure, but it wouldn't be worth anything because it has no support behind it.

The issue is the difficulty in acquiring them, not their usage. Most other countries distribute national IDs to everyone for free, usually for the national health system, another thing America's behind on.
In the US, there's a substantial fee (about $20-30) and you have to somehow get yourself to a DMV to get it made. While both of those aren't an issue for anyone above the poverty line, they potentially disenfranchise people without money or transport.
Additionally, without a nationalized ID system the majority of cross-state agencies have to fallback on the Social Security Number, a system which was never designed for anything more than managing Social Security accounts and yet is used for everything because the IRS needed a number that everyone was guaranteed to have. ([Watch this for more info.](

Every single person who supports bigblocks needs to buy a new desktop and a reasonably fast Internet line and try bootstrapping Bitcoin Core from scratch. Based on my experience in doing it over the past few days it takes about 48-72 hours depending on your disk speed. That's a little under a decade of 1MB blocks. Imagine that multiplied by eight. That's the route bigblocks is taking us on.
I used to support bigger blocks, back in 2015. It seemed more reasonable than implementing other systems that could make everything more centralized than it is now. And then, I asked myself this question: "Is it reasonable to have a public record of every single time I've ever purchased a coffee mirrored to every node in the world for all eternity?" If the answer is no, which it probably should be if you support Bitcoin as a full-scale decentralized payment system as opposed to just "digital gold," then keeping 1MB blocks and adopting SegWit and the Lightning Network is the solution.
The Core devs, despite their constant vilification, are *very* intelligent people. They've already worked out the solutions to these problems. I started considering the idea of handling transactions at a higher level and then eventually settling everything on the blockchain. Great work, I just invented the Lightning Network! WE ALREADY FIGURED OUT HOW TO SCALE BITCOIN, we just have you jokers filibustering the Senate because you don't like the party that's introducing the bill.
I don't fully understand the technology, full disclosure, and I do need to do more research to understand what needs to happen, but the basic facts as I understand them clearly indicate the bigger blocks will result in an exponential increase in blockchain size and price out most players right off the bat. SegWit, meanwhile, uses clever workarounds to technically double the size of blocks by simply changing how the signatures are stored. And then we can build upon that with the Lightning Network to create a system to move around small, repeated amounts of money (the typical usecase for currency) while taking up very little actual space on the blockchain. Everything stays nice and decentralized, and I can spend money without paying Western Union-level fees on each transaction. Sounds good to me!

145+ gigabytes. Note that the download speed is vastly improved since the "olden days" because they changed it to acquire a full set of block headers first, and then acquire the blocks non-consecutively from up to eight nodes at once, BitTorrent style. The original method just downloaded each block one after the other and it took a literal eternity.
But yeah, there's probably ways to optimize it even more than it is now.

Bcash was prepared to function as an independent fork and altcoin.
2x is an attempt to alter the consensus rules on the network as if they have majority control, but they don't. The result is a dangerous chain split that could (and probably will) result in people losing money. 2x is not an altcoin, 2x is an attack.

That's like saying Steve Jobs/Apple stole the idea for the iPhone because other smartphones were around at the time (an argument I've actually seen on forums occasionally). Yeah, sure, there *were* several decent smartphones around at the time, some even with touchscreens, but that doesn't negate the fact that the iPhone was years ahead of everything else in these departments (despite software limitations, like a lack of third-party apps, that had to be rectified over the next several updates) and spawned an entirely new revolution in portable touchscreen computing that's still going on today.

Yep, I was thinking about this a while back. As best as I can tell, it would be near-to-impossible to get any kind of consensus-based currency to work on an interplanetary scale without FTL communication, which is still impossible according to current physics.
This means that either we'll need to come up with a new system for an interplanetary currency, or someway to exchange currencies securely (I'm not even sure how that could be done safely, since it adds a whole new layer to preventing double-spends, maybe some kind of smart contract?).

No, SegWit is Core's way of eliminating fees and fixing malleability in preparation for T2 scaling. The miners lose nothing because the majority of their income is still the block reward.

No. Anyone can create a client that hard forks Bitcoin and if people agree that coins on that chain are worth money, then it begins to be used as "the new Bitcoin". The ONLY thing core devs have the ability to do is commit to a repository which hosts a reference implementation of the Bitcoin client. They don't get to control what is and isn't Bitcoin, they don't get to decide whether we should hardfork or not, and they sure as heck don't get to decide to censor ideas that go against their philosophy.
Both the mods of this subreddit and the core devs are trying as hard as possible to suppress the one escape valve hard coded into the Bitcoin protocol to keep them from gaining complete control over the currency's use.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:48:12
Sure! [ISO 4217]( standardizes currency codes for international usage. While the ISO has not formally recognized or listed any cryptocurrency in that, the standardization of fiats is that the first two characters of a currency symbol are the country and the last character is the currency name (USD = United States Dollar, GBP = Great Britain Pound, etc.). However, for so called "supranational currencies", such as gold, they standardized the use of X as the first character followed by two descriptive letters (since the ISO previously barred any country codes from starting with X). Gold, for example, is XAU. Therefore, in order to look "official" on trading boards, some people adopted "XBT" as an (as yet) unofficial, yet following standard practice, currency code.
Obviously, there are so many shitcoins at this point it's completely unreasonable to think that the ISO will ever give them all codes, so I assume that there will always be unofficial codes used by the crypto community. But it is reasonable that the ISO may standardize a code for Bitcoin and possibly other large cryptos at some point (they apparently have a working group looking into it), and that code will almost certainly be XBT.
&lt;nerd&gt;Fun sidebar: the [European Currency Unit]( a predecessor to the Euro used from 1979 to 1999, was denoted with XEU. But the Euro would ultimately receive the code EUR after it's creation. Why the change? The country code "EU" was reserved for (but not formally assigned to) the European Union just after the euro's launch in 1999, thus weirdly enough giving a "supranational currency" a country-specific currency code. The EU country code would also receive `.eu` as a top-level domain in 2005.&lt;/nerd&gt;

Bitcoin.com is a company, and it's selling a product called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is generally accepted to refer to the currency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and validated by consensus of the nodes running what used to be his code (yes, the history of Core is more complicated than that, shut up I'm making a point). Bitcoin.com is selling "Bitcoin Cash", a currency that was created without consensus from the community, the developers, or the nodes. By definition, it's a different thing. Therefore, Bitcoin.com is committing fraud.
I'm perfectly happy for Bitcoin Cash to exist and compete naturally with classic Bitcoin. The problem, at least for me, comes in when hostile actors start defrauding people and selling one crypto advertised as another in order to make what amounts to a political point.

This is an excellent guide, but I would like to note that keeping your coins on an exchange is almost never a good idea. Remember, nobody expected Mt. Gox to implode, but it did.
If you have less than $1000 or so in Bitcoin, it's perfectly fine to use a desktop wallet. Just make sure you both encrypt your wallet file, back it up somewhere secure, and don't do anything retarded on your computer ([anti-virus is basically useless these days]( don't rely on it to have your back). I personally use [Electrum]( since they have a great reputation in the community, use decentralized nodes for validation (no relying on one central validation node that could go rogue while still keeping you from having to validate the entire blockchain yourself), and have a no-nonsense approach to network forks.
Once you get a decent amount of BTC though, I highly recommend investing in a reputable hardware wallet like a Trezor or a Ledger Nano. They're generally only about $100 and provide the most security for your coins. (Paper wallets used to be a good option, but they're still a single point of failure and suffer from the normal issues that come from using a single address (deanonymization, funky change behavior, etc.).)
Edit: Oh, one more thing to add: XBT is used as the currency abbreviation on some exchanges/websites since it adheres to the ISO's country code policy. BTC is far more prevalent, though.

Hoo boy...


Bitcoin can be adopted by everybody already. Yes, fees are an issue for day to day transacting right now, but level 2 solutions will fix that. Bitcoin Cash's solution of "just raise the block size, ezpz" [has been proven time and time again to not work](


Yes, Roger Ver did good things before. But like several other prominent community members, he fell to the dark side long ago, way before BCH was even a thing. I'd say the fact that Bitcoin.com literally includes a gambling service is not the mark of someone interested in most interested in pushing the technology.


Bitcoin Core [has 15,544 commits and 483 contributors]( Bitcoin ABC (which forked off of Core, remember) [has 13,760 commits and 426 contributors]( But that's a crappy way of measuring contributions anyway, let's look at patch notes. [Bitcoin Core added]( improved fee estimation, multiwallet support, significant performance improvements, and limited SegWit support. Oh, and a bunch of fork safety improvements because of the never-ending forking (which is why full SegWit support was delayed). [Bitcoin ABC's release notes are difficult to even find (they're buried in a non-obvious subfolder in the repo as opposed to visible on the website)]( and seem to be limited to either minor changes and bug fixes and a few new features...that were backported from Core.


You do realize that the Core developers had nothing to do with 2x and actively said that it was completely broken for months, right? In fact, several of the Core devs actually came in and tried to fix the issues with 2x's code. And Cash was made by the people who originally supported 2x before opting to hardfork when it became clear that 2x wasn't gonna apply cleanly.

The censorship here was way worse when XT first launched. The mods here completely banned discussion of it, and that was a major contributing factor to me supporting bigblocks for a while (I wasn't as well versed in the technology as I am now, supporting a blocksize increase was a really poor decision in hindsight).
Now allows open discussion of both BTC and BCH (with limited modding of obvious trolls and spambots, which the account age flairs really help with) while heavily mods and downvotes anything that doesn't follow the narrative they're pushing.

I knew this was coming the moment I heard about the LukeJr incidents, and the corruption issues within the Bitcoin Foundation made it even more apparent.
Bitcoin's future is entirely within the control of the few dozen people currently working on Core. If they say we aren't to use paper wallets, paper wallets will slowly vanish. If they say we aren't supposed to use a particular client because of "security issues", real or not, that client will disappear. Heck, if they decide a service isn't "worthy" of having their transactions propagated, they will cease to be propagated.
This cabal mentality seems to occur quite a bit in free software, where a few people get control of the repos and thus gain the ability to do whatever they want, usurping control from the people (see Ubuntu). Even if you were able to make an entirely non-judgmental crowdsourced social coding platform, someone still has to host the servers for it. (Actually, why hasn't anyone thought of a decentralized blockchain system for software coding yet, that would solve this problem and more. Maybe have programmers sign various blocks they agree with and the more trusted the signatures are the more likely it is to be accepted? I don't know, I'm just rambling now.)

Yes, yes, yes! Stop playing the name game and let the chains compete on their own merits. That's the beauty of open source compared to corporate: the best product always wins in the end, not the product with the most lawyers and PR people behind it.

Still, he's done a great job controlling the story in the mainstream outlets. Ars Technica, for example, has done three stories so far since 2x failed, all of which heavily criticize the Core devs as "purists" and praise BCH as the future.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:03:09
Yeah, no. Satoshi himself stated a while back to consider his email compromised and any further messages are not to be considered legitimate. There's no digital signature, and the email himself doesn't even read like something Satoshi would write. I highly doubt this is him.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:04:32


Stopped reading there. The core devs aren't the gods of Bitcoin and don't get to dictate how the protocol is used.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:04:03
Well, yeah. But they were advertising it as one.
By definition, a small group of people shouldn't be allowed to just shut down an "upgrade" to Bitcoin. That's not how that works, and the fact that that is how it worked here is the final nail in the coffin for this retarded scheme.

Lightning Network will solve this problem. Small transactions like the infamous daily coffee will be handled via LN, leaving the blockchain clear for large transfers of money.
Assuming everything goes well, that will likely start rolling out by the end of the year and hopefully we can start moving toward mainstream by 2018. The hardest part was getting SegWit rolled out, the rest has been ready to roll for years now.

Nifty! If only the banks would get on board with crypto in the States, then maybe we could get support added to our existing ATM networks.

Most decent wallets offer the feature, but hide it behind some settings menu.
Exchanges, on the other hand, generally have to set fees themselves because the coins are pooled together in their hot wallets and they can't afford to send low fee transactions and risk screwing things up for other customers.

They either had a ton of money to start out with or bought massive amounts very early on.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:37:00
Annnnd this again. Okay.
[Andreas did a way better job explaining this than I ever could]( but I'll give the cliffnotes version:
All a blocksize increase would do for the consumer side is delay the problem a bit more. Scaling to international usage just using the blockchain would require us to eventually approach terabyte-sized blocks, which would have to be transmitted, received, and validated by every node...in ten minutes. We just don't have the bandwidth, storage space, or computing power to pull that off.
Solutions like the Lightning Network will allow us to move "small" transactions for purchases and the like off the main network while still keeping the decentralization we love. And the main network will always exist for large transactions between two parties that don't want to go through a tier 2 network.
The developers working on this know what they're doing, just take a deep breath and let them do their job. Remember, we've reached the point where one tiny coding mistake could lose billions in actual value (just look at the issues plaguing Ethereum). It's gonna take a while to get every little kink out to the point that it can be used by the masses without risking losing money.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:32:23
Eh...I was more referring to protection from fraud and insolvency of small banks. Obviously there's very little protection in the event of a true financial apocalypse, but that's not what I was trying to get at here.

1. Hal Finney was a cryptography god, and was the second developer employed by PGP Corporation after the legendary Phil Zimmermann.
2. Hal posted regularly on the mailing lists Satoshi was known to frequent.
3. Hal developed the first reusable proof-of-work system in 2004.
4. Hal lived not far from Dorian Nakamoto, he could have stolen his name to use as a pseudonym.
5. Satoshi disappeared just over a year after Hal was diagnosed with ALS, it's possible he discarded the identity as his condition worsened.
6. Hal continued to work on Bitcoin-related projects up until his death.
7. [Hal was the closest known match to Satoshi is a writing analysis]( although Hal later revealed some emails between him and Satoshi which linked up a bit better, though that doesn't totally disprove anything.
8. This one's bordering on conspiritard, but Hal was cryopreserved after his death, it's possible he could have held onto the Satoshi wallet in some way with the intention of using the funds when/if he's recovered, but ensuring they're protected until then because he knows spending them would kill the network (and any value in them, too). It would explain why he didn't leave his family the keys.
I personally think Hal Finney has the most evidence tying him to being Satoshi. It would make since that Hal would create Satoshi as a throwaway identity so he wasn't chased down either by governments or by people wanting a cut of the Satoshi coins. In any event, he certainly fits the profile far better than Craig Wright.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:21:51


Nobody can explain this to me: why the hell does anyone, anywhere still take Craig Wright seriously? The guy embarrassed himself in front of millions when he refused to provide verifiable cryptographic proof of his identity back in 2015 (the greatest cypherpunk of the 21st century doesn't know how to provide a verifiable proof of identity, riiiiiiiiiiiight). He should be laughed out of any community he shows up in, even agreed at the time that he was a fraud. And yet, he's still doing whatever he's doing and nobody's fighting him.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:20:54
Well yeah, given an apocalyptic financial scenario everything will blow up. But banks back you in protecting against minor fraud and crime, and the government backs you in protecting against bank failure in most non-apocalyptic cases.

Assuming you're talking about the post-Gox drop, that will most likely never happen again. At it's peak, Mt. Gox was processing *70%* of the world's Bitcoin transactions. No other exchange has gotten near that point in the years since it's implosion, and that's a good thing. Even if a service as big as Coinbase went belly up tomorrow, the impact to the network would be minimal and temporary.
Mt. Gox was a learning experience, just like everything else we've gone through. No one service should gain that much power. And, obviously, we learned that leaving coins on a centralized exchange, no matter how trustworthy they supposedly are, is a foolhardy decision.

Yep. This is the major problem: with traditional banks deposits are protected both by the bank and by the government.
Bitcoin is equivalent to physical cash, if you lose it, it's just gone. That's probably the best way to explain it to people.
Overall, the only real way to abstract away Bitcoin is via having someone else manage your private keys for you, in which case you open the whole community up to another Mt. Gox scenario.

That's impressive! Especially them being two-way, I've seen plenty of buy-only ATMs, but most operators don't want to bother with keeping fiat stocked (for good reason I suppose, Bitcoin supply can be managed remotely while loading up fiat requires someone on site, not to mention the added security risk to both the personnel and the machine itself) and so don't bother with setting up selling.

I guess I'm okay with this. 0.15 is a huge update even without SegWit, and I'm glad to see it out because it should increase the ease of rolling a full node (I know I will as soon as I get a bit better of a PC, still stuck with a laptop right now).
That being said, almost no major wallets support SegWit yet, which really needs to change ASAP. This tech has been around for several years now, why didn't anyone go ahead and code support for it to activate upon adoption?

If the KYC rules are the same at the ATM, which they seem to be in many cases, it'd be easier/cheaper to just go home and use Coinbase. The only real advantage with ATMs is that you don't have to involve legacy banks in the process.

Which is annoying for them, because 99% of these ATMs are run by independent companies that just rent the space.

I've been seeing a huge number of commercials for new online banking systems in the past few weeks, all of which show how "you'll finally be able to pay your friends back now" (exact words). PayPal even has the gal to literally call themselves "new money" as their slogan.

They hear one or two headlines and then equate it with things they already understand (banks, stocks, investment schemes, etc.).

They want to see innovation happen over night. That can't happen on the mainchain. People have wealth tied up in this, we can't just ship out new cool features overnight.
That's why I'm glad we have altcoins (real altcoins like ETH, not forks like Bcash): they can test and mess around with new features so we can see if they're worth the risk to backport them onto the main chain.

I disagree. There would be no drive to invent if the objects invented weren't protected in some way so that the person who invented them could make money off of the idea they worked hard on.
Imagine you are an inventor. You just designed a really awesome widget and you want to be able to sell it to make money off of your new idea. However, Bob purchased one of your widgets and proceeded to reverse engineer it and start selling his own widgets. Should that be allowed? If you were inventing something, wouldn't you *want* it to be protected against people stealing it and making money off of it.
That being said, I'm only talking about patents and copyright above, not DRM. I think there are many perfectly legitimate ways you can protect your property without imposing insane restrictions.
@_date: 2015-02-27 01:00:04
That's actually a legitimate issue, and I do believe that patents should be reformed to prevent patent trolling as well as to lower the "grace period" simply due to the fact that innovation is going much faster now. But they shouldn't be abolished.
