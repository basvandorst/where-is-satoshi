This was the other point I was wondering about. If I want to transfer bitcoin to someone off network using a piece of paper, it’s really the transaction I would have to write down not the actual coin right? Since there is no “actual coin”?

Thanks for the breakdown.  As for it not mattering at all I totally understand from a utility perspective it means nothing. It was more of a theoretical question.  And yeah just because you could doesn’t mean you should.  Would you say then that a bitcoin just an easy representation of 100M satoshis and those are the real units? Or “atoms” of bitcoin?

Do you have to have an account with BoA to do this?

There are a few typos in the tour section that I saw.  Either way it looks like a great idea!  I definitely will be trying it out.

Ah yes that makes sense.  But to us poor college students who just want to buy one for fun, it makes a little less sense to spend 1/4 of the price in fees.

This is where my issue is.  If it costs a $45 fee to transfer my money in order to purchase bitcoins, Am I not helping the big banks that bitcoin is against in the first place?

So my account verification has nothing to do with funding my account?  Which funding method did you use?  All I have is a bank account with a local Credit Union.  Will I be able to fund my account on Mt. Gox that way?

I see, since bitcoin transactions are one-way, I could, if I were scumbag Steve, pay you with my paypal account, recieve the bitcoins, and then try and convince paypal that the transaction was fraud or something?  Don't they have checks in place agains this kind of thing?
