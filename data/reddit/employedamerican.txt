Awww now you’re obsessed with me. Cute. I suggest you get over me. Please. It’s not healthy.
Lay off the soy. Tap on your little MacBook go back to your room until I say you can come out.

Shitting ~ Challenging. I don’t care .
Could you move on? If you need something to do this weekend I’ll be in Laguna Beach, I have plenty of yard that needs mowing. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:44:44
Lmao. Wouldn’t last 4 seconds. You’re my internet toy.
Keep obsessing kid. ❤️ 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:50:44
Do something about it big man. Lol. You keep replying. I love it. You’re weak because of it.
You are obsessed you cannot win yet you continue it’s hilarious it is making my day.
You know less than zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:24:34
How do you know I don’t do that? Have you ever met me? Think about that.
Did you know you’re on the Internet right now?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:58:01
Are you? If you're not, you're able to tell the difference between someone who is and who isn't? I'm interested. Put your charts where your mouth is.
Who are you? You're Important? Please tell us more.

Ohh she’s angry now.. delicious 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:38:35
Why would you assume you know anything. It has officially made you look “stupider” than originally thought. Your ability to deduce anything is laughable
Shh kid. Don’t get in over your head. ’

Ahh another soyboy projecting. 7-11 isn’t a job kid.

Can't use it in the United States. It's useless.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:14:10
Ok then. I see things correctly now.

Always wait for the dip.

It will take like a week for money to and from a bank with Coinbase. The ACH process is abysmal, it's awful, it's slow as balls.
It can't be helped until ACH is updated in this redneck country called MURICA!

I realize that but Americans don’t care. The earth revolves around America.
It’s currently Thursday 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:47:15
I had to learn. I started with and gathered a TON of information and motivation.
Since I eat steak, chicken and fish a lot, I just learned how to modify EVERYTHING I order when I’m out to eliminate carbs nothing fried nothing breaded. No carrots or apples (yes they’re healthy but it’s not time to eat them yet) swap sides and everything for broccoli. Drink a ton of water. 
Read labels, don’t buy bread. Load up on cheese.
I stopped at 20g a carbs a day. 
I cheated with a kids scoop of ice cream once a week, maybe
I committed, I sacrifice a lot of what I want to eat for what I want to look like. The real and actual results MAKE ME try harder and keep me excited.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:08:08
Welcome! I'm a new, nervous, twitchy member as well. I stare at my fraction of a bitcoin wishing it was a whole coin. Hopefully it'll be many whole coins one day. 
As they say in crypto, to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:13:16
stop crying. Jesus Christ. Stop stalking me on reddit creepy kid.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:41:35
That’s a good point. I often think about the Coinbase ACH  process that take a million years. If not for that I probably would have spent all my money lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:00:42
Virginia. No he doesn’t.

Please kindly fuck off bot. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:21:11
Coinbase.com is your best bet. Simple easy to understand but with limits
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:56:48
You can’t even accidentally buy BCH . No place sells it lol.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:34:15

Hell yes! I know people who are no longer diabetic, have nearly cured their arthritis and fibromyalgia. Back pain, allergies, you name it! 
Ketogenic diet. High protein and fat 20g of carbs a day MAX. Changes a mans life. Health, physical shape all for the better. I lost 49lbs in 5 months. With heavy cardio  and weightlifting as well to see results faster. I’m healthier at 40 than I was at 16-39 yrs old.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:29:05
Use fat for fuel. Unless you don’t need to lose weight. Then carbs are good. The human body prioritizes carbs over fat that’s why we never lose weight unless we’re burning it in the gym.
Most Americans are triple buffet belly bloat, couch potatoes and can’t move then complain about it lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:50:35
iPhones are terrible. Typos and corrections instead of just typing what I tell it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:38:22
They can’t regulate it really. There isn’t a central Location to stop it. It’ll be like the war drugs. All for show. They can make it illegal but no one will listen and there will be no way track who is doing what. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:27:00
I do IF everyday. It’s made me feel a lot better.

Neither did anyone else.

Memes are how we communicate in the digital age. Haven't you heard, a picture is worth a thousand words? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:57:44
you're a living meme!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:22:50
one intelligent forward thinking comment in a sea of ass kissers, idiots and people that simply do not understand reality. 
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:29:40
Did you know a dollar can be broken up into 4 quarters? or 10 Dimes?
Crypto works the same way except in decimals. 
OP literally owns about - 0.00243199 Bitcoin, or whatever it was worth when he bought it. If the price of 1 Bitcoin goes to $10,000 he'll have made about $7.00 lmao.. 
IF you own half a bitcoin (.5) and the price goes to $10,000 then you made some money.
That help?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:43
This. Waiting Patiently.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:59:13

@_date: 2017-11-24 02:11:50
Market has been complete fucking shit. It’s becoming clear that it’s just a digital version of AMWAY.
Unless you got in early you can suck a dick basically..
Everyday same shit. Goes up, the goes waaay the fuck down another fucking week to maaaaybe go back up close to where it was..  I hate rich assholes. Would punch. 10/10

Reinvest and move to America! The economy is improving since we finally have real leadership now. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:30:58
It is . It’s a hot wallet. Cold wallets are offline . OP asked to get started. Coinbase is the way without reading , researching or attending a 2 hour seminar
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:40:41
It’s not what Satoshi Wanted. BCH is a perversion, an abomination of his dream. A vile mutant that will be destroyed 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:00:36
mine are completely different.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:00:24
That’s great to hear. Contrary to the media the people here are friendly and want people to succeed. Regardless of race or country of origin. 
You’re always welcome! So glad your mom ok . Hold on to her while she’s here. We only get one.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:27:32
Imagine if all the banks in the US crashed and everyone lost their  money? Would suck right? Well only for those people that didn’t keep their money in the bank.
Same with online wallets. They go out of business or we have an EMP attack.... those of using hodlings in a hardware wallet will be rich. Everyone else, will be poor.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:34:15
Yeah, yeah help me pay for gender reassignment surgery guys!

really torn between this and Trezor Model T.. the user experience on this one is rather poor compared to an actual screen that's usefull.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:29:12
First person I’ve seen with any sense. Hodling forever makes no sense. Especially if you’ve made a few grand. Use it! Enjoy it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:19:34
R u from the future?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:38:45
Think of a stock. In the stock market. That’s all this is. They have value too
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:20:08
I know you think you know everything . So I’m gonna let you continue thinking that. Like liberals you cannot penetrate their ignorance. While the world around them slowly improves they’ll continue to scream kicking fart that everything is horrible and they will miss out good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:14:45
Yeah it’s probably headed to 9K today that’s a solid dip in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:21:40
Oh my god. Is that how it works? I’ve stalled again. Only thing I haven’t done is increase my fat intake. I must do this immediately. Thank you! (I’ve cheated and ate French toast and ice cream) lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:46:42
It’s happening now. We won’t see 5k ever again. A dip is likely going to be 7or 8k
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:02:12
Not US
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:29:13
so no one seems to be able to answer the simple quesitons. 
I have bitcoin. Where is my bitcoin diamond? How do I get it? Coinbase will provide me the balance? I'm fucked and I have to go commit 34 felonies ? which is it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:28:03
It’s carshing again.. lol 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:27:15
They don't provide any customer service, but they're the only place/company that provides any useful / intelligent service.
It's an unfortunate conundrum 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:44:42
Yes. All time low is now $10,000 per coin. Get it while you can!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:20
Got it. Simple. Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:31:44
Lol I’m not racist. Are you stupid? Nevemind don’t answer that. You need to see a doctor
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:17:48
Why Christmas?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:57:01
Yes. This is the easiest way to do it. You can cash out here too and send directly back to your bank as well. Of course it's ACH and take 5 god damn business days.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:26:49
I don’t understand the question. What is this church?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:20:57
No idea what a gmta is or gbtc.  Lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:23:41
Im just gonna stay quiet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:02:17
That’s just it . Only people that didn’t keep their money in the bank will have the power. Paper money. Or hardware wallets, at least you have it. Even though you can’t spend it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:50:00
Reducing carb intake alone is the best possible advice ever. Sugar next to that.. be lazy all day if you want just stop killing yoruself with these two things.
Lose weight with no effort. Be rich. Enjoy life.
