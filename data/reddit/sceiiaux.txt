Just bought .001 last night, first $100 purchase ever!!
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:10:01
Having just purchased my first investment, a tiny amount of $5 in bhc, eth and ltc, this gives me hope. Thanks.

Ah didn't know if it was a program or physical. Probably keep my in coinbase till I can buy a Trezor. Tha KS for the help

When does this take effect? Pay day today so I went to go buy and it's says 8 days for me to receive coins. Buying via coinbase from my Ally money market debit account.

Hmm. That makes me not want to use coinbase. Especially as I learn more about this fork coming up. Well payment went in at $5560 which is pretty close to what I wanted to do. Got any recommendations on exchanges? Willing to go from mobile to PC and eventually get a Trezor.

I should have waited to exchange BTC/Ripple, could have doubled my Ripple purchase for the same price. Ugh. Noobie mistake. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:16:47
Oh perfect thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:58:13
Yeah that's probably it, but in a couple years it will be worth it. Where do you send them after they clear?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:20:55
Hard Fork I imagine. Im just a noob but i dont want to have anything to do with BTC till its over, and I barely know whats going on. Better safe than sorry I guess. Im trying to gain on the Ripple stream right now but same feel. Patience is key.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:06:50
Ahh auto correct. BTC

I love how you have the highest AND lowest score post on this. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:00:02
Do you have source?
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:37:30
There is something brewing, I feel it. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:06:02
Made purchases today from my Ally account, says 7-8 business days :/
