We're in the infancy of Bitcoin and there's already pools mining 6 blocks in a row. How does that look long term? Assuming what you said is accurate, why are you rolling with a potential problem in BTC and not PPC?
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:01:24
Hmm if this is a kinda problem 5 years into Bitcoin, what's in store 50 years down the road? If only there was some other coin that implemented a feature that was specifically designed to be immune to 51% mining attacks.. [oh wait..](
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:43:59
Except NBT doesn't have any.

The creator of PPC says he doubts Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus and add it. Guess we'll see.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:45:19
I recommend people come to Peercointalk.org and have a discussion with the community there. The creator of the coin has said they will be removed, I find it silly to dismiss a coin that could have a problem down the road when the main freaking coin is having it's second close call within a week.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:20:45
I believe you are correct, it doesn't decrease overtime, but it is intended to be removed.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:33:13


So PPC?
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:11:50
I'm guessing it was both because far less people knew about BTC, and there wasn't specialized hardware out made specifically for mining. Even one 10K piece of equipment puts a person/entity above what most people can afford. So when you're super rich, it gets even more ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:27:12
This is why proof of stake will outlast proof of work.
@_date: 2014-01-08 10:07:47
Fair enough. It is worth noting it is not even 1.5 years old compared to Bitcoin's 5, so it has quite a ways to go and things to prove in many aspects.

Working well so far :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 02:17:00


This remains to be seen as PPC is *not* trying to accomplish the same thing as Bitcoin.
 &gt;   Both PPC and XPM are designed to last. PPC is designed with energy efficiency, XPM is designed with energy multiuse. Bitcoin has a long term uncertainty as to whether transaction fees can sustain good enough level of security. Before that the main concern is how to balance transaction volume and transaction fee levels. Currently I get the feeling that bitcoin developers favor very low transaction fees and very high transaction volume, to be competitive against centralized systems (paypal, visa, mastercard etc) in terms of transaction volume, to the point of sacrificing decentralization. This also brings major uncertainties to bitcoin's future.
   &gt;  From my point of view, I think the cryptocurrency movement needs at least one 'backbone' currency, or more, that maintains high degree of decentralization, maintains high level of security, but not necessarily providing high volume of transactions. Thinking of savings accounts and gold coins, you don't transact them at high velocity but they form the backbone of the monetary systems.
 &gt;   PPC is designed to serve even better as a backbone currency. The proof-of-stake technology in PPC is not only energy efficient; it also maintains high level of security without relying on transaction fee. Thus PPC could be safely designed with strong scarcity property yet serving well as backbone currency.




But even if the transaction fee was removed or reduced, 1%  inflation (that is paid to everyone) is a pretty reasonable number. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:29:23
The future is scary, I know. But if you actually believe in the spirit of cryptocurrency you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss things.

@_date: 2014-12-15 05:18:26
What about cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the US dollar? Presumably computer safety features and technology will improve, allowing a regular person to reasonably feel safe about using them. Decentralized crypto banks are coming, disadvantages of those aside I'd rather support those than regular banks, so I hope it works out.
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:56:31
Common misinformation about Peercoin. It is actually very anti inflationary. Take a [look]( here for a few estimates of how many coins will exist. There's 21 million now, and expected to be around 50 million in 30ish years. Also .01 PPC is destroyed during each transaction, curbing inflation and meaning in a year with enough transactions Peercoin can actually deflate. It essentially pays every other coin holder.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:28:31
If you looked into Peercoin you'd know the whole point of it is to be a 'backbone' currency, savings account, store of wealth, whatever you want to call it. In all honestly it's not even trying to accomplish the same thing as Bitcoin exactly.

No I'm not retarded. I think prison is vile, and most monkeys like yourself are completely desensitized to what it actually is. Only people who represent a clear and **present** danger deserve to be in prison indefinitely, no matter what they did. If someone commit a crime where no one was actually hurt..? Unless there's actual evidence that they would attempt something like that again, then yes, they absolutely deserve a second chance. This isn't fucking rocket science.

And it's really fucked up because they could make money by legalizing, selling, and regulating current illegal drugs too. I'm sure they punched some numbers and they make more money with it being illegal, but the humanitarian bonus of legalizing drugs should make this a no brainer. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:05:05

Peercoin isn't even trying to accomplish the same thing as Bitcoin. The fixed .01 transaction fee is the key feature to that. Quotes from the developer:






 &gt; Both PPC and XPM use protocol enforced transaction fees, which reflects my preference that high transaction volume is discouraged in favor of serving as backbone currencies.
 &gt; On the other hand there is no promise that minimum transaction fee wouldn't be adjusted. If processing capacity of personal computers continues to advance at the current pace, both max block size and minimum transaction fee could very well be adjusted at some point. However I do take a very cautious approach to adjusting transaction fees, as opposed to bitcoin devs. The impact to the fitness of the currency as a backbone currency is of great concerns to me.
Completely unrelated quote from another post:




In other words it's supposed to be a low transaction volume, secure, energy efficient way to store wealth. Not a currency you buy poptarts with at walmart. Designed to do completely different things.

No it's not. They are guaranteed minimum wage. If that 2$ plus whatever they get in tips equals 5$ an hour for example, the employer must pay them the difference. In practice I don't know how long it has to be, over a few days, a couple weeks, a month, but they are guaranteed minimum wage by law.

@_date: 2013-07-19 06:19:13
It's funny that you're so reliant on math yet can't see how uselessly you're using it. I'm not arguing which fucking drug delivers more destruction to the human race, OBVIOUSLY alcohol does. That has less to do with how dangerous alcohol is by itself and what we as a species have done to exacerbate it. Until other drugs are legally and culturally put on a pedestal like alcohol it's not even possible to compare what the damage would be like. 
Its  like cloning 10 trillion chickens, releasing them all over the planet, and then when inevitably chickens kill more people through one way or another, you try to say chickens are a more dangerous animal than a hippopotamus.




 I KNOW alcohol is addictive, damage, ect. Again culture lets it be so more than the drug itself. I'm pretty sure I was closer to dying two days ago when I took a suboxone than I have ever been drinking. And opiate addiction can most certainly lead to death..


That's because I take it you've never met an actual drug dealer who deals in quantities far beyond selling to 1 person. For those types of drug dealers, whether or not it gets only sold to consenting adults isn't even something they can control.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:34:59
Really? Because I am a server. And it's a moot point anyways because all the servers I know are making more than minimum wage shitty days excluded. Like I said, I don't know how it works in practice, just pointing out they are guaranteed the REAL minimum wage by law, so go fuck yourself.

Awesome, thanks for the response. Couple of questions. So you are not actually "wiring" any money during this right? There's not some 25-75$ wiring fee of any kind?

 No I fucking haven't. The very first fucking time I said that I meant dose for fucking dose. One beer versus one opiate. Which is worse? Which is more deadly. My brain is actually capable of looking at a drug based on it's chemical structure and separate that from how much damage it does in society. They are two different things.

@_date: 2013-07-19 05:58:07


This was never my point. I was never judging the character of the addict, just the seller. The seller doesn't even need to use the drugs either.


So there are many different levels of drug dealers. In my experience even one person can be responsible for a LARGE amount of drugs shipped to their location. They then sell 10% to person A, 20% to person B, ect. Person A and B aren't buying for personal use, it's more than they could do in two months. They are also reselling. It literally gets dispersed into the local community through dozens and dozens of hands. With some drugs the effects will be minimal. With others, depending on the community, catastrophic.  I'm just saying the person who brings that shit into their community just so they can make a buck without thinking about the repercussions is probably not that great of a person, or at the very least isn't really thinking.
There are some drugs out there that really don't provide much and might as well be poison. 


If you're just talking about effects on humanity, of course alcohol has been massively destructive. But that's because of culture we have that lets it be everywhere. Hell some people don't even consider alcohol a drug, it exists in it's own world for some reason.
It would be like cloning 10 trillion chickens, releasing them all over the planet, and then when inevitably chickens kill more people through one way or another, you try to say chickens are a more dangerous animal than a lion.


Maybe they are. It's certainly worth looking into. I most definitely consider the restaurant I work at a liability. We sell delicious, extremely unhealthy, and dare I say addictive food to the elderly, children, people who are the most vulnerable. All in the name to make money.

Alcohol is absolutely not one of the most dangerous or deadly drugs around. The fact that is causes so much destruction is  testament to how widely accepted and used it is. Millions of people engage in it every night in a perfectly healthy way. If half those people tried to casually use mephedrone, almost any opiate or countless drugs neither of us have heard of it would be completely different.  Alcohol is not really that dangerous or addictive of a drug by itself.


Most people are ignorant douche bags that wouldn't even spend a minute of their time thinking about where the alcohol their company sells is going. It's their companies, not theirs. The company is selling it, not them. Context bro. If I'm gauging how great a person is, their mindset is pretty big and a comparison of some store clerk at 7/11 versus someone who specifically goes out of their way to supply a drug - it's completely fucking different.

In any case.. Let's hope they treat him all right. Any idea how much time he could face? Hopefully not life, the dude is a straight hero.

The government is not me. It has never been me and it will never be me unless I become a dictator.

Maybe but at worst they say " we don't want you selling that here so you can't". It's a far cry from the world stage government that has control damn everywhere and will put you in a cage like an animal if you disobey them.

Go ahead Bitcoin. Enjoy your fucking reign. Enjoy it for a long time. Stop being such dicks about it though.
