Let me explain it this way.
There are 100 people. with 100 bitcoins
People 1-99 each own .9 bitcoin, and person 100 owns the rest (90.9 bitcoin) Now lets say that person 100 wants more money. In a deflationary economy he sits back, props his feet up and makes 2% a year (on currency) and thus makes 1.78 bitcoin in todays market value next year. So whats the problem? Theres only 98 bitcoin left. So this guy didn't do anything to get a bigger percentage of the pie.
So if you have a full economy of this going on you have 2 things. You have wages going down (in terms of bitcoin) because, well, theres not enough bitcoin to go around. Then on top of that you could invest in something for a percentage return on investment, say even 0%, someone pays you back in full, and you still profit.
So with a deflationary economy you have full risk of someone paying you back when you could do nothing and get better returns on your investment. so you don't spend your money, you hoard (HODL) it. So now the people with .9 bitcoin each had to stay alive and spend .1 bitcoin each, so now, instead of wealth being created, its just going to the hoarders. But in this situation theres no reinvesting, no need for paying other people and no need for spending because you're getting richer by having money under a mattress.
This is also true for stagflation (0% change in inflation). What you want is inflation, where you want your $1 to go down in value so you seek out value with your money. You want to buy into things like Amazon, Google, Tesla, GE etc, because you believe they will create more value than sitting in the bank account. How? Well theres a lot of things that contribute to a companies value, but first and foremost is spending and something called velocity of money. If GE is making a profit it means that people want it, and people can spend money on it. 
But that money comes from somewhere, so in inflation money is added to allow for economic growth. In deflation you are just finding a business who decays the slowest, and at that point why be in business, when you can just hold onto the money originally?

That doesn't change the fact that bitcoin is deflationary. If one person had 5% of the bitcoin in existence, no matter how many decimals you move that person still has 5%. Now if 1% of bitcoin goes poof every year due to lost wallets and unrecoverable failed transactions then that 5% grows as a proportion of the available bitcoin without anything happening.

how about you do a basket of goods like CPI and not just the housing market. But also ignore the fact that houses are becoming bigger, amenities are becoming more advanced and technology in houses plays a huge role too. 
Having central AC with electricity in every room, with a R coefficient in the double digits with sound proofed walls and 30-year lifespans on roofs is going to cost more than a shack from the 40's

Deflation does not compensate inflation at all. An apple increases in value due to deflation, an Apple isn't deflationary. Also apples are not in static supply. Becuase Gold (real gold) is in static-ish supply it doesn't increase the value of the USD, the USD just falls slowly because of the outstanding dollars in existence.

When there is reward for no risk (making effective money for doing nothing) there is no need to invest outside of the money itself. 
When theres no risk needed to profit, you seize spending (especally on non-essentials) and on investing. That means that future companies will not exist. And no matter how hard you try for those big-ticket items (houses, cars) you will never be able to afford them because you will never make enough bitcoin to achieve the original asking price, as your wages will go down because of deflation. And your stored value (if you had any) wont increase because there nothing to invest in.

IOTA is going to hit top 3 currencies before June, my guess is it will overtake etherium by end of 2018 unless a true killer application for ETH is figured out. 
I bet IOTA will hit 50b market cap as well before end of 2018
The tech behind iota is amazing, and if they can fully get nodes to add/remove properly and remain decentralized it will potentually be faster to do transactions than it would be to have a central entity (ala VISA/MC) while having 0 transfer fees. If you can get point of sale machiens to work on IOTA and charge say .01% to the merchant, you've gotten that much closer to one, creating a global currency, and 2 allowing people to transfer money and shuffle it around.
The only problem, and with all cryptos is the fact that there is constant deflation. I really wish there was a way to fork out more currency to prevent currency hoarding/HODL-ing

no but ICOs are.

gambling: with enough bets placed over time you will lose, mathematically impossible to win
investing: potential to win over time with enough bets placed, unknown math to prove/disprove

commodities re usually hedges against inflation, as the commodities themselves are not going up in supply while the value of currency goes down in terms of purchasing power.

I guess you dont understand how deflationary economies work or how they are highly similar to commodities

The Fed doesn't raise the debt ceiling, nor do they issue credit when money is out. They issue credit to pace inflation (now). Its also irrelevant to the debt ciling being raised by congress.
The fed controls monetary supply now (since the 80's) and it tries to pace a 1-2% inflation rate. Theres economic reasons why inflation is good and deflation (like bitcoin) is bad for the average person.

Inflation does a few things. You want money to be inflationary for 2 reasons. One is it prevents hoarding money as an investment, this prevents the desire to stash cash in a rock somewhere and have it appreciate in value. You want people to reinvest that money back into an economy.
In a deflationary economy with currency you have those who invest the money in nothing. You can have the value of the money go up by its mere existence, it prevents reinvesting in an economy (as there is value gained at no risk) because why would i invest when i can live in perpetuity off the principle.

Have you thought about it like this. You are a citizen of the world, theres loons everywhere, you may not like em but you can agree with them sometimes. 
No different in Cryptos, the larger the selection the easier it is to spot the growing number of crazies, however you define them.
