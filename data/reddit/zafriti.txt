So, this is people buying Bitcoin with crap Tether?
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:29:33
agreed. I doubt we would see sustained 5-6k range again unless someone like Coinbase got hacked and lots of people lost millions or the stock market had a huge crash.

I could be wrong, but I believe the ownership of the forked assets "goes with" who ever currently owns the Bitcoin unless you moved the forked coins to your own wallet. Does someone know something to the contrary?

Volatility is low which means day traders can't make a fortune day in and out. 
It is good news however that every time it dips below 11k, it bounces back up. We're figuring out a nice support line.

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:28:35
If believe if you held Bitcoin for a long while and amassed a lot of capital, then yes, you will need to pay capital gains tax on the increase at the moment you sold it even if you bought back in. 
So you owe taxes on your increase as of that point. However, if/when you sell BTC down the road, you'll only need to pay taxes on the increase from when you bought back in. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:13:14
look at the past 4 years.. We've had large dips starting the middle of Jan. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:58:53
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:05:02
We are establishing the support line. Big investors don't want to buy at 11k if it is going to drop to 8k. What we've seen is actually a good thing because anytime the price dips below 10k, it quickly rises, showing that folks have a lot of confidence in the sub 10k price point. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:08:44
I doubt that the entire circulating supply is "fake" any more than the entire circulating supply of USD is fake. I suspect a great number of people use Tether to get out of Bitcoin when it's high and buy back in when it's low.

Ahh, here's the FUD! Found it! 
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:28:15
What if people don't care about decentralization? What if they don't care about the technical stuff, and they only want to make money? What if all they want to do is to send &amp; spend their money in a way that is cheaper &amp; faster than the current system? 
I ask this because Bitcoin is operating on the premise that people want these things. 
However, I wonder if crypto currency will go the way of privacy in the US? One would assume that most people would be ticked off to find out that their own Government was spying on them illegally. Snowden found out the hard way that most folks don't really seem to care. I'm amazed (but not surprised) that most people don't care. 
So, if most folks don't care about privacy, why would most folks care about the advantages of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:56:50

@_date: 2018-01-31 13:54:24
I don't think so.  Bitcoin market cap = 172 Billion. Tether Market cap = 2 Billion.
Folks may have temporarily parked their money into tether to buy Bitcoin once it got cheaper, and guess what? It's cheaper!
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:36:58
But what if someone other than Bitcoin (who isn't decentralized) makes it easier and cheaper to spend money w/o the rules and regulations of a bank? 
What if folks care more about their currency remaining relatively the same value year over year than they do about 3% annual inflation? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:47:27
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:18:27
Well for folks who started buying sub 5k, Hodl is still a good strategy. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:51:25
Exactly, and so if people only really care about the Money, they will go with whatever crypto is going to make them the most money regardless of the merits of the system. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:21:06
Privacy is an excellent example of something you'd think would be universally valued. - yet it's not. People are willing to sacrifice privacy in exchange for what? Peace of mind? 
So, what are people willing to sacrifice to safely invest/ spend/ send /make money in a crypto world? 
I believe the good traits of Bitcoin should be universally valued, but my concern is that I'm just a weirdo who appreciates liberty, complete ownership of private property, and taking away power from big banks/ centralized Governments. I have found that most people don't care about such things until catastrophe strikes (like Greece, Venzuela, etc). 
Americans and much of the Western World are far too comfortable with the status quo and we would need to see major financial turmoil in order for people to question the current system or want to change it. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:35:06
I think for folks who got in Oct- Early November, the market has been nice to them. For folks who got in the week before Christmas... must be hard for them to see the long term benefit of crypto.

I've considered it also. But the more I thought about it, the less appealing it seemed to me. 
Although if things continue like they have, I'll have more money in crypto from 6 months of investing than I'll have from saving in my 401k for 5 years.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:37:59
Kinda, especially because the total Bitcoin purchase volume over the last 24 hrs has been at least 14% Tether based on what I scanned from CMC. 
But that report is too complex for most folks to understand. ELI5: How does Tether (or any crypto) create something that is worthless and then use it to buy Bitcoin? Doesn't somebody have to sell their Bitcoin for said worthless coin? 
If they are selling it, doesn't that mean the seller sees value in the coin? 
I don't follow how people buying Bitcoin with Tether is a problem when folks are willing to sell their Bitcoin for Tether. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:01:42
You're welcome. I just bought some more Bitcoin which means it will drop in value by a few thousand within a few days. Just remember to thank me when you snatch up cheaper Bitcoin!@

@_date: 2018-01-10 11:57:48
Yeah, I sent Bitcoin from Gdax to my wallet and it cleared within about 20 minutes and it was free.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:00:00
Worst case scenario (correct me if I'm wrong): 
USDT becomes worthless and it's creators walk away with a ton of Bitcoin. 
Anybody caught holding tether during the crash, is on the hook. 
People who weren't using Tether (most people) say "you should have known better". The end. 
The Federal Reserve does the same thing as Tether... creates money out of nothing, supposedly to keep the value relatively the same. 
I don't see a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:37:37
Part of the reason is because big traders have limit sell and buy orders in so that if Bitcoin goes down, it triggers a lot of automated buying and selling in the market. 
And the most common thing people sell alt coins for is Bitcoin.. it's the port in the storm even though it's still wildly volatile.

zero fees, but they charge you monthly fee for "Gold Buying Power"? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:17:32
Nobody will use Bitcoin as a currency as long as the value continues to be volatile. Otherwise folks will be afraid they'll be the next guy who spent 10,000 Bitcoin on 2 pizzas.
Or, as a vendor, you run the risk of the purchasing power of Bitcoin declining 45% in the matter of a week or two. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:57:01
I just hope the price stays low long enough for me to buy more at the end of the month or even with my tax refund. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:57:21
Phew! My last big Fiat purchase of Bitcoin was at $16,700 as it was coming down. I thought that was a good discounted price. So seeing Bitcoin back in good form is a relief! I didn't have any extra Fiat during the 11k dip but I'm glad I at least didn't buy at 19k. 
To the moon!
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:40:15
No, you wouldn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:24:04
I'm sure they had nothing to do with the fact that Bitcoin jumped 7k in value in a matter of days, just days before futures began. 
Even though someone did the math by looking at addresses and found that someone made 200 million in one day buy pumping and dumping. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:16:32
There's a 100% chance of it going up or down.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:20:15
For real, wait for moon till tax return or at least the end of the month ��
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:46:03
I thought the point of Tether was for it to closely follow the valuation of the USD so that people can sell their crypto when the markets are heading down and then transfer it back before it goes up without having to deal with fiat. Therefore, if a ton of people are exchanging their coins for Tether, then the supply of Tether needs to increase in order to keep the price relatively the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:48:56

@_date: 2018-01-11 17:49:07
I learned the hard way. I sold half a bitcoin (all my Bitcoin) in September not so much because of the China FUD but because I was down on my total investment at that point by a few hundred dollars. I sold @ $3,600 and I knew it would go lower.. it did. It briefly touched 3k but I had already used that money for other things. 
Fast forward a few months later and I'm just now back to where I was but if I had held, I'd have a full Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:34:26
I still think Bitcoin could beat Dow Jones to 30k and that it could happen by then.  
EDIT: If our "bottom" is 7-8k and we ride that line for the majority of the year, then compare that to 2017 and what could happen. If our new bottom is 10x what it was a year ago, we could be in store for big things. I don't really see the price falling much more than 7-8k because the potential for whales to make a fortune would be too irresistible.

and... it's gone! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:03:09
It was. It jumped like 5k in two days. This can easily be done with the level of money some of the whales have.
They drove the price up for the beginning of the futures just so they could make more money by not only selling their Bitcoin high, but by shorting Bitcoin because they know the price will go down (because they artificially inflated it). 
Go back and find the reddit article about how one person made like 200 Million in a day by buying tons of Bitcoin around the 14k mark, which caused a FOMO buy and then they sold at around the 18-19k mark. 
Now that "old money" has a way to manipulate a completely unregulated market, they will do so and insider trading will make a lot of average people poor. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:28:17
Should we be concerned with people being able to basically create trash coins out of thin air and buy Bitcoin with said trash coin? (IE Tether being used to buy Bitcoin). Won't this drive the value of Bitcoin down?

Mosaic Law forbade usury but Mosaic law was fulfilled when Christ was born. That is part of the reason "an eye for an eye" was replaced with "love thine enemy". 
If you have any examples of Christ mentioning usury specifically in the New Testament, I'd be interested in learning about it. 
Christ also taught us to be profitable. 
"14 ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, whocalled his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thougood and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be takenaway even that which he hath.
30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

Thank you, your description of how crypto wallets work is the most comprehensive and easy to understand instructions I've ever laid my eyes on. 
That said, I still don't get it. :( 
BUT I think I'm beginning to! My biggest take away from what you wrote is that a wallet doesn't actually store crypto currency, rather it is like a keychain that holds seeds/addresses/ secret words or w/e so that you can claim your crypto at a later date. 
So, if I were to get a hardware "wallet" like Trezzor, I could send Bitcoin from an exchange to a public &amp; unique address that the wallet produces? Is that public address visible on the wallet itself? Or does it need to be plugged into a PC? And would that public address look like the long string of characters like I've used to send Bitcoin to others before? IE "235vjrifnv94824389etc"? 
Does that wallet then pair with a private address or code that appears like a string of characters like "235vjrifnv94824389etc"? Or is that private address or seed with the string of 12-24 words? 
So then that private address will have ownership of that Bitcoin and the global blockchain ledger will record that I sent Bitcoin from an exchange to a public address associated with my wallet and my secret seed unlocks or authorizes my ownership of said Bitcoin? 
What if the wallet experiences a mechanical failure? Does it have to be plugged in to send or receive crypto? Or can it be sitting in a fire proof safe? What if someone steals the wallet? 
When is the string of 12-24 words revealed to me and is it ever possible to have it be displayed twice? Do the words appear on the device itself or on an application on your computer? 
If the wallet is stolen, the thief can't access the Bitcoin without the phrase, correct?
In order for me to "get my money back" don't I have to reveal my secret phrase to a third party to prove ownership? Isn't that risky? 
I'm just trying to think of ways to safely store crypto long term and anything mechanical, digital, or if it uses a USB to connect makes me nervous. Who's to say that in 20-30 years trying to find a USB port would be like trying to find a floppy disc drive. 
I'm such a noob, please enlighten me! I've watched numerous Youtube videos and read a lot of instructions but I still don't get it.

@_date: 2017-12-11 19:00:30
I've noticed this is a common barrier for entry for many of the people I've spoken with about Bitcoin. "It's too expensive now, I can't afford it" is the thing I hear all the time. And I've got news for you, this is a bad thing if you really want Bitcoin to achieve mass adoption. It needs to be simple. 
0.00000345 Bitcoin is much more difficult to wrap your brain around (and bring up in conversation) than to say "345 Satoshi's". 
Right now, when most folks are talking about Bitcoin, they are referring to it as "I just own a fraction of a Bitcoin" or they just say how much their Bitcoin is worth in USD. They can't even remember how much they own without looking at an app on their phone. 
I like the mBTC solution proposed by the OP and eventually, we will need to have values for individual bits so folks can say "I've got 6,000 Satoshi's" or w/e. It would also help if folks can buy and sell individual bits and have it labeled as such. That way they feel like their investment is more substantial than just a fraction of a thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:35:57
I believe it's when people with "insider" knowledge know something about a stock before it is public knowledge and those individuals then use that knowledge to either buy / sell at the right time in order to maximize profits/ limit risk. 
An example of this would be the person or organization which made $200,000,000 on the day that Bitcoin spiked to 19k. That person knew they were going to invest millions into Bitcoin over a short period in order to drive up the value and then sell at a certain point. 
If a handful of wealthy individuals got together and all decided to buy Bitcoin all at once, driving up the price, and then they all agreed to sell at a certain $ amount, that would be like insider trading...
Or better yet, the Lightning developers knew they would be making a big announcement and so they told buddies with money and they could have profited from "insider" knowledge.

It's not just big money. Bitcoin will never see 1,000% or 2,000% annual gains again. Folks are trying to find the next 1,000% or 2,000% coin so many of them are buying some of the "cheaper" stocks like Ripple, or Cardano because they see they are worth just a few cents per coin and they imagine a scenario where they later are worth hundreds a piece.

Factor in fees.. and factor in taxes. Each time you sell Bitcoin, you need to pay capital gains taxes.. so you basically you're betting that the price will drop more than 30-40% if you want it to be right. 
If you sell high and buy low, you're trying to predict the future twice... whereas if you just buy low and hold, you'll make more in the long run!

I tried to send BTC to a different exchange yesterday to buy some Ripple and it took 13+ hours and it cost me $14 to do it. 
By comparison, I sent Ethereum from Coinbase to that same exchange and it happened in a matter of minutes and it only cost me $0.50
This is a problem we would be foolish to ignore. You want Bitcoin to hit a million USD? It will never happen until the # of exchanges per second is increased and it's cheaper to send &amp; spend Bitcoin!

Bitcoin will no longer have 2,000%+ or 1,000%+ annual gains like we had in 2017. 200-300% annual returns are still possible. However, I think most people are now trying to find "the next Bitcoin". They want to find the next crypto which will have 1,000%+ annual gains. So, what you'll see is a slow and steady rise in Bitcoin while other coins have larger percentage gains. 
I know this is anecdotal, but my Father-in-law is a baby boomer and I just introduced him to the crypto world. He could care less about Bitcoin right now. He sees that 17k price tag and wants none of it. He saw Litecoin @ 100 USD, and bought a few and now he's tripled his money in just a few days. Now he's looking at things like Ripple and IOTA because they are cheap and he thinks he can afford $4 coins or $0.50 coins. And of course, he's right.. cause what if that $0.50 coin becomes $300+? 
And the longer Bitcoin goes without lightning, the more market share it will continue to bleed out to other crypto's which can handle the load and do transaction for less. 
So as for me, I'm keeping the majority of my Crypto money in Bitcoin while also using some of the profit I've seen to invest in other crypto's just in case one of those ends up being the iPhone and Bitcoin the Blackberry.

This is why many Chinese people invest their money in the US where they know that the chances of the Government seizing their property is minimal. I met a young man visiting from China and he said that in his small town, there was a farmer who had started with nothing and had built a successful/ profitable farm. The Chinese Government came in and took the land / business from the farmer and essentially said "This is ours now, but we'll pay you to continue working the farm".

The answer is obviously no. The US Gubment could close down Coinbase tomorrow if they just planted some evidence that they were funding terrorism or some such nonsense.

No. If you want Ripple, I believe it would be better to have Ethereum on Coinbase and then send that Ethereum to Binance for about 50 cents. (Open a Binance account if you're in the US). Then use the Ethereum you sent to Binance to buy Ripple. I tried both ways and using Bitcoin cost me $15 and it took 14 hours, versus the 50 cents on Ethereum and it took a matter of minutes.

AVLights06, There are so many crypto currency options that it can make your head spin and there isn't enough time in the day to research them all. Andreas Antonopoulos (look him up if you haven't already) was asked which one's to avoid and he basically said if there are 1,000 coins, 900 of them are probably terrible. 
I look at the market today and I think it's wise to diversify to a point. My plan is to basically follow the top 5-10 crypto's according to market cap. I believe for someone like myself who is just getting started, this is a good way to avoid junk coins and limiting risk because they have already been "tested" and shown to succeed. If you want to compare that approach to the stock market, It would be like tracking the S&amp;P 500 which has shown to be a good choice in the "old" way of handling finance. 
So if Bitcoin is 65% of the total market cap, then put 65% of your crypto portfolio into Bitcoin. If Ethereum is 25%, put 25% in there and so on. This way if one of the other currencies ends up being the innovator that beats the original (which History has shown to happen). You can have a piece of that. As much faith as I have in Bitcoin, I wouldn't want to have all my eggs in one basket. 
Oh, and if you really just want to explore small amounts of money into speculative investing, then invest in coins that offer solutions to problems currently facing the bigger coins and or the tried and true method: Pick coins based on strength of name or buy every coin below X value in USD like a penny stock. 
Even if Bitcoin fails, crypto currency is the future so be sure to pick the winning horse!

No, it can take a week or more for money to show up, especially if it's done through a routing method instead of through a debit card. (Debit card transactions are faster but they cost more).

There is, including the fact they didn't leave their equity alone. I believe they refinanced to lower their monthly payments and possibly took out loans and the house needed repairs, etc. It went to Auction and between all of the fees and what the house sold for, they got nothing out of it. 
Edit: I believe they refinanced more than once, and each time you do, you extend the period you're paying more interest than the principle balance. 
Which is why I took out a 15 year fixed loan on my own house so that 47% of my monthly payment is going straight to the principle balance (versus only 10% or less on a traditional 30 year).

Not for federal taxes..., and certainly not taxes based on income. 


I pay anywhere from $1700-1800 a month in taxes. My mortgage is $900 a month, I spend $600 a month on food, and less than $100 a month on clothing. 
I know that at least part of the taxes I pay goes towards killing brown people in the middle east. $100,000 missiles to blow up a mud shack. 


Running debt is only good when it's producing more wealth than it costs to create more debt and it's sustainable. Our current rate of adding to the debt is not sustainable and I would argue does not benefit us more than it costs.

Wrong. The role of the Constitution is to [limit the Federal Government]( The founding fathers did not want a large federal government. 


I don't think you understand... they are breaking the law already. Going to war requires Congressional approval. 
Thing is, they don't call it war anymore. They just blow stuff up and kill people as the President/ military desires. In fact, we haven't had an official declaration of war since [World War 2]( Everything since has been conflicts or  ["authorizations of force"]( and what not which are basically blank checks for continuous- never-ending war. 
It isn't constitutional. 


See above.. they've warped the system to somehow make continual war and occupation "not war". Without a large standing army and blank checks for military spending we wouldn't have this... 


Cool. Every world super power since ever has fallen in part because of the ever expanding taxation, cost of large standing armies, overspending, devaluation of the currency, hyperinflation, etc.  Apparently we're immune from all of those things cause 'Murica.

The Federal Government should basically be limited to the Court system, elected offices, and a military that is only funded enough to protect the country from foreign invaders or internal enemies to the Constitution. No more Military industrial complex, no more endless foreign wars. 
Check out this great interview with Milton Friedman where he talks specifically about various Federal Government agencies and how most of them could just be abolished. 
States should have more control over what they want to do with regards to regulations, taxes, etc. w/o the Federal Government subsidizing the states, most States would be forced to stick to budgets that don't cause deficits. 
I say taxation is theft, but in reality it is far more nuanced than that. It is simply a slogan that hopes to increase the awareness of wasteful government spending and make people aware of how much the Government takes from them. 
Right now, I pay more in taxes than I do for housing, food, and clothing combined. Does the government provide more benefit to me than my housing, food, and clothing? No. 
I'm not a total an-cap, but I see the appeal in maximizing individual liberty and people retaining the majority of the fruits of their labor. We can have things like roads, fire departments, police, local court systems, etc at a fraction of the current cost. The Federal department of Education for instance is a total waste.
Check out this chart: 
The US is 21 Trillion in debt, which only serves to enslave us and future generations. I want a balanced budget amendment - where federal spending can not exceed what it brings in. All of the war-hawk republicans who loves dem some war can feel the sting of it when at the end of the year, they owe an additional 3-4k in taxes. Same goes for lefty -liberals who want every kid in public school to have an ipad and daily message therapy in their safe spaces.
So yes, "taxation is theft" is an abstraction of a larger, more nuanced problem.

oh boy... where do I start? The Federal Government is the biggest culprit in ignoring the Constitution. They basically add an additional layer of bureaucracy that is not needed - hence wasteful spending. 
They start wars w/o congressional approval, they spend more on the military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, France, UK, and Japan combined. Killing foreigners over seas isn't generating wealth in America. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars will cost taxpayers at least 6 trillion dollars over time. The States aren't running around trying to play world police. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:40:04
Low income/ unemployed people are already paying to use the roads.. my State has a gas tax of at least $0.50 per gallon. 
If you eliminated wasteful spending in education, or reduced it significantly, you'd be able to do more with less. Plus, you're assuming that there won't be programs to assist those who want to attend school but can't afford to. I don't think forced state education is needed for every kid. Our schools today are more similar to prisons than they are institutions of learning.

There is no reasoning with Communists. They are defending the actions that lead to the deaths of 100 million people over the past 100 years by flippantly saying "that's not REAL communism!". 
They want you to think it's just coincidence that mass starvation and murder occur at a disproportionate rate whenever folks get on the path towards the Communist "Utopia". 
To be fair, what we have today isn't "real Capitalism", but the difference is that the attempt at free market Capitalism actually reduces extreme poverty world wide because it generates wealth. Who cares if the rich are getting richer as long as the quality of life of poor people is increasing at a substantial rate? 
It is funny though how Communists love to point out how "evil" rich people are stealing my businesses 3-7% annual profit margin but don't seem to have a solution for what happens when the business isn't profitable. It's also interesting how they care about the 3-7% "theft" that occurs from profits but they don't seem to care about the 30-40% in taxes that the Government takes. Talk about not getting to keep the full fruits of your labor.

If I thought more than 50% of my taxes were actually going to help the poor and the needy, I'd probably be okay with that. 
However, I believe the actual % to be much lower than that. 
It's like when you hear about charities that have really high administrative costs so only 25-30% of what you give actually ends up helping poor people. You don't want to give to those charities. You'd rather give to a charity where at least 90%+ goes towards helping people in need.

Under what conditions would we be able to see a relatively stable value for Bitcoin? By relatively stable, I mean no more or less than 3-5% difference in a given year. And before I get the whole (1 BTC = 1BTC), all currencies are judged by their purchasing power. If we want Bitcoin to become a world-wide currency, it needs to have stable purchasing power.   
Could that be possible with enough adoption?

huh? People sell Bitcoin for Tether when it's at a high point, say $11,000 USDT, and then they wait for the value of Bitcoin to go down and then they buy more Bitcoin with the tether they have. They just day trade using Tether to avoid paying taxes. I don't understand why you're bringing up cash. You can't buy Tether with USD as far as I know. 
The reason they print Tether is because the demand for tether goes up.. when demand goes up, they have to increase the supply so that the price will remain relatively the same.

Is it possible that the increase in the demand for Tether is that more people are using it to trade for Bitcoin in order to avoid "cashing out" their Bitcoin? IE, market goes up, they sell their BTC for tether which stays relatively the same and then buy BTC when the price of BTC goes down? 
This could be a way to get around having to pay taxes in USD if those transactions are not being reported.

Bitcoin won't be better money until 
1) it only changes in value a few % points a year. (Value as it relates to purchasing power, not just price in USD)

Today marks 6 months from my first Bitcoin purchase. 
I was still new to Bitcoin so I must admit I was nervous about the China ban news back in Sept so I sold when it went from roughly 5k down to 3k. 
Instead of buying back in, I used the money for other stuff. 
I started again from scratch on Oct 31st and I continued to buy all the way up and down. I think the highest I paid was $17,200 but it was for a small amount. 
I thought I had learned my lesson from Sept. JUST HODL! I thought as the crypto world headed down... 
I didn't mind losing the 2x+ returns which were still significant, but my attitude changed as soon as I started to go red on my overall investment... Feb 5th was my breaking point. 
 if this goes down to 2 or 4k? I could buy even MORE Bitcoin!) 
The price did continue to go down, from when I sold, but then I took a nap and by the time I came back to check, the price was above where I sold. 2 painful days went by as I watched the price get higher... finally, I fomoed back in @ $8200. 
Here's what I learned... if I had never sold, I'd have 2x my current stack. Even after buying all the way up and down, I'd still be way ahead of the fiat I had put in.  
Don't be like me... don't be a dummy. Don't try to time the market. Just buy and HODL! 
The graph above shows when I bought and sold. Buy High and Sell Low like a pro!

The disparity between the Uber wealthy and the poor doesn't matter as long as the quality of life is improving for the poor at a significant rate, which it has over the last 100 years.

Scenario: I buy 0.1 BTC @ $7,000 on Coinbase and then I send it to my cold storage wallet.
A few months later I buy another 0.1 BTC @ $10,000 on Coinbase and I immediately send that 0.1 BTC to another exchange to buy an alt coin, do I have to pay short term gains taxes on the 0.1 BTC I bought months before?

Well, we are relying on the developers of Bitcoin to make a better crypto with things like Segwit and Lightning Network to make transactions cheaper/faster/better. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 11:27:53
That's the idea. I'm still not sold on it, but if we reach mass adoption, the purchasing power may stabilize.

Normally big dips like this are caused by FUD. I don't understand how Bitcoin holds $6k for a year and then plummets again out of the blue. What was the trigger?

Hopefully the fish won't rot while you wait for transactions to go through. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:40:45
Well, it's still March and Bitcoin is $6800 so I'd say based on the data you just posted, we could be around $4000 by March 2019 and maybe $5,500 by March of 2020.

The crash of 2013/2014 was brought on by Mt Gox and many folks losing most (all?) of their Bitcoin. In order to see a similar trend, exchanges like Coinbase and Binance would have to have all their crypto stolen.

@_date: 2018-03-01 15:31:30
It is deflationary and the only way it will become widely used as a currency is if it starts to only fluctuate about 3-4% per year. (I'm not sure if that's even possible) As long as you've got the potential for it to increase in value by 100+% in a year, folks aren't going to buy a car in January when they could spend half as much to buy a car in Dec. 
Bitcoin will be a storage of value for a good long while before it becomes a useful currency.

@_date: 2018-02-12 14:52:11
I hear ya Chris. However, I do think a deflationary currency would work as long as it's only gaining about 1-2% in value per year which is theoretically possible if it reaches mass adoption.

@_date: 2018-02-04 20:43:54
That's not necessarily so. Price determines how much Bitcoin you can afford to buy and if you believe in Bitcoin, you want 2 Bitcoin, not .5 BTC. You can still believe in the future of Bitcoin and sell when it makes sense so that you can get even more Bitcoin.

The amount of Bitcoin you hold does not matter as much as it's purchasing power.  I understand 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin. However, the value of all currency is determined by what you are able to get in exchange for said currency. 1 Bitcoin today does not really equal 1 Bitcoin 5 years from now because hopefully the purchasing power of Bitcoin goes up by then.

Note to paragraph (D)(2)(I)(C).
When securities underlying warrants or convertible securities are being qualified pursuant to Tier 2 of Regulation A one year or more after the qualification of an offering for which investment limitations previously applied, purchasers of the underlying securities for which investment limitations would apply at that later date may determine compliance with the ten percent (10%) investment limitation using the conversion, exercise, or exchange price to acquire the underlying securities at that later time without aggregating such price with the price of the overlying warrants or convertible securities.

I believe you can invest no more than 10% of your net worth unless you're an "accredited investor". 
I recently invested in a start up before shares were made public and these were the limitations as they were explained to me.
It makes sense. It prevents folks from taking out a 2nd mortgage to buy at ATH's (unless it's crypto). 
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:13:46
Bitcoin is the original- the Mack Daddy. The market responds to it the way stocks respond to the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500. However, Ethereum has shown lately that it doesn't necessarily follow Bitcoins rises and falls and might actually be a good way to diversify your investment. (And yes, Crypto is purely an investment based on speculation of what it could be one day)
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:17:24
So, you hate companies taking on 5% profit but you're okay with the Government taking 50%? (Factoring in income tax, property tax, sales tax, etc etc etc)
When my company has a good year, we typically get bonuses and it allows them to reinvest back into the company.
For instance,I'm getting a promotion this year in part because of the decrease in the corporate tax rate.

It is unlikely that many people will use Bitcoin as currency as long as it remains volatile. It will need to get to the point where it only rises or lowers 3-4% a year before folks spend it. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:14:23
It's no conspiracy. Crypto is risky AF and they don't like risk. You can't buy stock with a credit card. Using credit to "invest" is really bad. If you max out your card on beer, at least you got to experience the beer and use it. If you max out your card on crypto, and it tanks, then you will really be holding heavy bags.

EDIT: I figured it out... I'm using Google Sheets but this is what I did and I believe it's correct. 
Use this function "=sumproduct(B$2:B$16, D$2:D$16)/sum(B$2:B$16)"  List the USD value of your purchases in column B row 2-16 and the price per Bitcoin is in column D rows 2-16.

When markets crash, folks tend to avoid volatility in general, and Bitcoin is about as volatile as it gets.

I don't think folks act like there is no other place to store our money, rather we believe Bitcoin is better than a system where a private party can arbitrarily print additional currency which reduces the purchasing power of the money we already have.

Taxes would be possible, but depending on what sort of layers of privacy were established, it would become very difficult to track/ enforce taxes on anonymous P2P transactions. I think ultimately, the tax structure will more closely resemble a consumption based or voluntary tax system.

To me...  "Rich" means rarely having to worry about Money and where it comes from. I believe it happens once a person is debt free, and they have accumulated enough wealth (and invested it wisely) so that their money is now generating enough revenue for them to live off of if they wanted. It means not having to work or having to work very little.

We're not far away from "$2,000 last year" and "$4,000 last year". We're just a few months away from being able to say Bitcoin has been worth at least $4k for an entire year. When considering this... it makes it seem much less like a bubble, and more like we're seeing increased adoption and faith in the value of Bitcoin.

I made an actual purchase for $300 on Jan 23rd.
On Feb 14th, my checking account was charged for $300 again even though no such purchase appeared in my Coinbase account. 
I reversed the $300 Duplicate charge from 2/14  through my bank and did it according to Coinbase instructions. 
($600 left my account and I only received $300 back)
A month later, Coinbase notifies me that I reversed payment on the legitimate transaction that took place on Jan 23rd. (I did not). 
I had already moved my Bitcoin off of the exchange so they insisted I pay them back in USD for the reversed charge and that my ability to buy had been disabled. 
I opened a support ticket to dispute the error, and while my support ticket was getting looked at, Coinbase charged a different account that I had "synced" with them without my authorization. 
The level of incompetence and poor customer service there is astonishing.

I'm not talking about the duplicate charges from Feb which were supposedly the fault of Visa. Coinbase told me to have my bank reverse the duplicate charge (so I did). A month later, Coinbase said I owed them for the amount of the reversed duplicate charge and a few days later, they suspended buying on my account and charged me AGAIN (without my authorization) for the duplicate charge that had been reversed. 
So I did what they told me to do and they charged me for it and effectively disabled my account.

We will really see a boom once exchanges start listing fractions of a Bitcoin per USD valuation. Buying 100,000 Satoshi's for $100 will be far more appealing to the average Joe than buying 0.00100000 Bitcoin for the same price.

It does, but I don't see what tether has to do with this.

That stuff is not as relevant as the overall price support over long periods of time. Soon, people's perspective will change from "I can't believe Bitcoin was only worth $1,000 last year" to "I can't believe Bitcoin was only worth $6-8,000 last year".

The only person I knew buying Bitcoin before 2017 was my heroin addict nephew who used it to buy drugs from silk road back when that was still a thing.
Consider yourself fortunate for getting in really early and I'll consider myself fortunate for being able to get in before the majority of the population. I think years from now, people will say "I'm so glad I got in before 50k" and you can laugh all the way to the bank. ��

I don't know much about this particular scheme, but the advice I shared above has served me well so far.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:52:46
And then a month or so after that, Bitcoin would have been worth at least 3k for an entire year. If we get to September without dipping below 4k, Bitcoin would have been worth at least 4k for an entire year, and so on. 7k is to 2018 what 1k was to 2017. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:14:55
It's just a hopeful prediction based on some anecdotal evidence. I've spoken with numerous people who don't want to convert fiat to Bitcoin because they don't want to own a fraction of a whole. 
Eventually, if Bitcoin is going to be commonly used as a currency, 2 things need to happen... The value of Bitcoin needs to be less volatile (maybe only lose or gain 2-3% annually). 
And folks will need to refer to the value in whole increments. That cheeseburger needs to be worth 1,000 Satoshis, not 0.00001000 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:53:18

I panic sold back in Sept during the China ban fud. Used the money for projects around the house... Started buying again in October and it took me months to get back my .5 BTC. Told myself I'd always hodl. I had lost half my stack from panic selling. 
Then we hit 19k, profits were big. Between BTC and alt-coins, profits were up for me more than 100% and that was just from starting at the end of October from scratch. 
I watched as my profits dwindled.. oh well didn't care. 8k "profit" down the drain.. oh well, hodl I said. 
Then I got to my break-even point by Jan 31st. Once I was below break-even, shit got real. I didn't care about losing the 8k in profit nearly as much as losing 2k of my hard earned money. 
We drop to $6,600 and I start to think.. "What if this goes to 4k? I can sell now and buy lower..." so like you, I sold at $6,600 but back on Feb 5th. 
It did go lower, all the way to $5800 but I didn't put in any limit buy orders. I took a nap, and by the time I woke up, It was at $7200... damnit. 
"Maybe it will come back down.." So I waited... and then FOMOed back in a day later @ $8200. I lost .1 BTC in the process. (which is a lot for me). 
So, if I had just Hodled, I'd have nearly double the Bitcoin I  currently have and even in this bear market, I'd still be up. 
So, even if we drop to 3-4k again, I'll just DCA and lower my overall BTC price. Hopefully burning my hand twice is enough of a lesson to learn.

Let me guess, you sold at 19k and now you're waiting for it to hit bottom and you'll know exactly when that will be too. Congrats on knowing it all and being Uber wealthy. I know if I had tons of money, I'd be on Reddit rubbing it in instead of just living life and enjoying myself.

I think Bitcoin will eventually account for about 30-35% of the total crypto market cap and alts typically follow papa Bitcoin though there have been some exceptions.

Traditionally, when the stock market crashes, people put their money into risk averse assets, not assets that are more volatile and more prone to risk/ manipulation. If the stock market is going to crash by 40-50%, why would you put your money into Bitcoin where it could still drop another 80%?

I think when markets are in decline, folks tend to avoid risk, and Bitcoin is pretty damn risky.

Just be very careful. One wrong move and all your Bitcoin will be gone. One of the lovely features of Bitcoin .

Fuuuuuccckkk. My biggest regret is hitting my "don't invest more than I can afford to lose" threshold around the 6k Bitcoin price. I can't even afford to buy this dip and I'm down 65%+ oh well.

It was painful at $6,000. It was fuck my life type shit when it dropped another 45% like overnight. $13,500 buy-in down to $4,000. GG. At one point I was "up" $7,500. I'm still bullish long term but holy shit this has been a rough year.
