No, I get your point. You'd be challenged to make it professional enough to pass although as business accounts don't offer much benefit I doubt it's impossible. Doing it through a personal account risks raising money laundering concerns and in the UK you won't get away with that. Which is actually a good thing if you put the bitcoin impact aside.

Don't believe this. There is no pressure or reason for this in the uk unless people are using personal accounts to conduct bitcoin business in which case they need a business a/c. False news.

Altcoins are booming so people likely selling a bit of bitcoin to diversify portfolio and if enough people do it the supply goes up and price down. But bitcoin remains bigger and stronger and safer long term.

Different altcoins will serve purposes in the future, they need time to grow too. And yes not all will succeed so hold a few of each and your investment in the winners will more than offset what you lost on the losers. And as many altcoins are bought in BTC they are helping grow that market too in the meantime.

Less than 0.04% of population has ever owned a bitcoin. And only 300k own at least £5k of bitcoin. Heard both at recent fintech event and no reason to disbelieve.

Don't worry. It's just another short editorial by someone who clearly knows nothing about crypto assets 'cos thinks all just want to be a payment currency. Guardian is a clever paper so will know they are an idiot who doesn't mind proving it to get the paper some free coverage / publicity. It's all ok really.

Great thanks. But there's no milk or bread. The plants have died. And as for the cats...

See there is an upside for the banks after all!

$7263 low then bounce back to $9346 by 20.00 uk tomorrow. Then ATH next week. This is a total guess as coinigy has gone down with all the other sites so can't see any data. But guesses tend to be as good as anything when it comes to bitcoin prices.

Will be interesting to see whether this just gets bought up

This really is news. They are perhaps the top investment company in UK.
