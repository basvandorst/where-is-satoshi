I love the idea of a way for people to attain Crypto, but the technology is going to grow so much over the next few years BTC, ETH, LTC will all be coins of the past. They are the pioneers of the crypto space but not long lasting currencies.

Won't do much good once people realize BTC is far behind other coins and lose value as technology increases. Everyone is kind of jumping the gun on BTC. Just let the technology improve to the point of an actual useful utility to start earning rewards on it. Im all for crypto but lets be honest and admit the tech behind BTC sucks compared to other coins that are coming out.

I'm sorry that my reddit age doesn't seem reliable to you, but just because I finally made a reddit account doesn't mean I'm new to crypto as well.

If you have spent enough time in crypto, done your research, watched the news, and talked to people about it, you find out two things..
1. The people who are well informed on the blockchain and its capabilites, know that it will be adopted in the future somehow
2. The people who know nothing but speculation with crypto predict crashes and claim a market bubble, and do not believe in the tech behind it. 
So basically... do your research for yourself and you will see that this is going to change our world.

I appreciate your honesty. I'm not trying to sway or move the market down in any way (Why would I, I'm heavily invested in crypto just like a lot of us). I'm just trying to make the point that with more adoption and more technology improving as we speak, BTC is not the best currency as others have already improved transaction speed and utilized use of smart contracts which is a MUST if this thing is really going to work. I still see BTC in the future as a store of value, like some refer to as "digital gold", but no one is going to go buy a cup of coffee with gold. I see BTC in this same way. BTC will be a form of value, but not a viable currency.

Whatever wallet you choose to use, make sure you are using an offline wallet (should be self explanatory). Hackers are working hard to break through to exchange wallets, so cool storage is a must with the rise of interest in crypto.
