I don't live in Hawaii.  But I wanted to.  Tightening crypto regulation is gonna fuck that up tho.

Fuck.

This is what's beautiful about open source development.  You can hype all you want, but you can't fake actual progress and hard work.

Basically.  Writing quality code is a trapdoor function.

Lol Ethereum.  
  
You got conned by a tech project that is/was so convoluted and absurd that even the con-men think it's legit.  
  
It's not.  It's a plate of disaster spaghetti.  Please get out while you can.

So do you agree with what I said, or will you just ad hominem attack me?  
  
Because I think my point is valid, that if what this person is saying is true, it will be a paradigm shifting mathematical breakthrough.  And those kind of breakthroughs need humble releases that speak for themselves, not teaser tweets about what is to come.  
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:03:02
That's not the argument at all.  The argument is that quality mathematics doesn't need pre-release hype.  
  
Usually when you see such hype it surrounds scam projects like 'John Conner's' Vanillacoin/Vcash or Dash.  
  
My point is that what he is suggesting would be such a paradigm shift, it should not be made as a tweet with no further backup.  
  
As well, hostile attitudes like yours telling perceived newbies to 'stfu and read more' are also what I expect from scams.  The truth does not fear dissent nor opppsition.  The truth is self evident.

Verified and true!

I am familiar with his contributions to patching several flaws in the Bitcoin code, and his correct skepticism and criticism of Ethereum.  
  
He also is correct in that the path forward with Bitcoin is not through endlessly increasing hardforks to raise block size.  
  
His achievements lead me to believe he is the caliber computer scientist that should know that proper mathematics doesn't need pregame hype.

More insults against the person, and none against the argument itself.  Is that your default response when you know you're wrong?  It's quite weak.  
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:32:31
Step 1.  Fundamentally misunderstand how blockchain technology works, which has been harshly vetted by people likely much more intelligent than you.  
  
Step 2. Disregard those idiots and declare that you have discovered a new angle no one else has.  Don't seek feedback for your innovation early and often.  Keep it a secret until the 'big reveal'.  
  
Optional Step 3. Profit by selling some kind of stake or token or some other scheme.  If you want to be really smart don't presell, but structure things such that you capture a disproportionate share of incentives early.  
  
It's a tale as old as time.  And a waste of good enthusiasm for things that actually matter.  Mr. Lerner is intelligent and accomplished enough that he should know better than to brag about his (possibly legitimate) innovation prior to release.

Holy wow!  If you ignore the Mt Gox fake spike, the entire price history of Bitcoin has made a beautiful exponential curve upward according to the AUD.  ��  
  
Satoshi = aussie confirmed?  
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:40:31
The banks' entire approach to blockchains has been pure dumpster fire.  
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:46:39
Not.... every currency lol.  That is, if we are considering other cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-12-17 00:38:50
I never claimed it was amazing.  And the headline never claimed that Bitcoin crushed all useful and practical currencies.  It said *all* currencies, which is false.

My favorite part about your snarky tone is that the map you posted is of the Arpanet, which is an older and legacy version of the tech we actually use today.    It has since been decommissioned in favor of newer and more robust protocols.  ��

This is not Coinbase's fault.  These are Know Your Customer requirements.  
  
Be mad at laws, not the compliant companies.  
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:53:56
Monero has a flexible block size that can't ever get 'stuck' like this.  Bitcoin could implement it, but not while they have a hard cap on the number of coins.  
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:54:57
Ummm, passionately advising anyone to 'invest' in a cryptocurrency is probably not a good idea, especially not their life savings.  
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:05:11
It's not the copies you need to worry about.
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:12:35
Oh.  It's so beautiful.  It's blinding.  ��
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:15:18
This seems totally wrong.  Marty would be the one who wants to buy Bitcoins, and Doc would be advising him against using the time travel machine for personal financial gain.  
  
Then Biff would steal it, go back in time and buy hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and in alternate 2025 claim to be Satoshi.  Leading to an awful parallel version of Hill Valley.
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:32:08
Bitcoin is already not fungible.  And law enforcement already tracks the living shit out of the blockchain.

I recognized the vernacular of a scamcoin slinger.  I don't fault myself for asking why a legitimate advance would be wrapped in it.  
  
The best approach to take in this field is to humbly recruit others to help you vet your ambitious projects, and release projects that are ready for public scrutiny to the wild, slowly increasing visibility as their viability becomes assured.  
  
Hyping up something that doesn't even exist yet under your public name is remarkably against the spirit of cryptocurrency.
