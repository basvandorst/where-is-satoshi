Well I don't monitor the projects, but I am happy that so many people found my offer useful AND they didn't bug the shit out of me for support.  In fact, there have been zero support requests (that I can recall) for the entire year, which is pretty special to me.  
I'm thinking of ways to take this whole 'free vps for bitcoin' thing to the moon. :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:56:31
Hi!  I'm glad you asked.  Please follow the instructions in the OP and I'll hook you up (with a free VPS for your project). :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:59:44
Ouch.  Do you have a project?
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:55:24
Yes, I'm using Virtualizor by Softaculous &lt;
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:07:19
Cheers.  Bitcoin is awesome.  I'm just a person with extra resources.

Wow, nice donation!  Cheers!  
Your VPS is up.  Sent details in a message here.
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:50:31
Technically, tens of thousands of domains :)
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:04:02
You sent the wrong amount!
The total was 0.02 BTC but the order address received a different amount.
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:05:10
Haha.  Been wading through my messages and just arrived at yours actually... :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:30:14
Your VPS is live, and yes, you can change the OS to Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 in the Control Panel.
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:51:54
How many of those retweets were bots?
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:29:51
1) Create a DNS records for your domain name pointing to one of the IPs on your VPS.  2) Configure domain in your software (web server, mail server, etc.).
This is basic stuff here... not really going to be providing this kind of support :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:40:22
Spend and refill.  Your Bitcoin investment remains unchanged.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:25:41
Cool!  I've created your account &amp; VPS.  Check your email for details :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:01:06
There are four nodes on the server in question.  Adding more doesn't help the Bitcoin network.  Otherwise, I would definitely give you a VPS for your node. :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:40:05
Alright folks, no Satoshi.  Back to watching bitcoinwisdom...
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:33:46
Nice.  VPS is up.  Check your email for details.  FYI I will probably be increasing CPU time for all nodes, sometime in the future. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:32:43
@_date: 2014-07-06 05:21:08
I'm going to sleep, but will give away a few more in the morning.  FYI, about 20 went out so far.
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:24:41
Wowsers.  Would love to help GreenAddress!  Send me your details and I'll set it up.
@_date: 2014-09-02 18:06:54
donated 35000 bits.
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:36:52
Yes, the cart owners could really use the extra 3%.  They all have high fees and many wont even accept cards due to fees.  They have to turn away business.  And I rarely carry cash, so I often have to skip those yummy cardless carts! :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:32:43
Maybe.   Users here should know to encrypt sensitive information and use cold wallets, etc.   I've had 20 years to steal customer data and it hasn't happened yet -- and no one outside of bitcoin encrypts anything.  *shrug*   
Edit: Yes, it would suck.  Please secure your shit :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:27:08
Ahhhh.  hah.  Hate problems like that :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:47:45
Yea. Originally I thought accepting a minimal transaction directly would be enough to deter random people from scamming for a free VPS.  Then I decided to donate those transactions all to a worthy Bitcoin cause (havent done it yet - not sure if MultiBit can send from a specific receive address?).  Then I decided to make it about $6 and have the VPS recipient send it to their favorite bitcoin cause.
There are still VPS's available.  I am not sure how many I'll give away.  But I do know I will have to upgrade the SSD hard drives already! :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:16:51
Cool.  I like it here :)  Still need more local bitcoin businesses though (especially a growler shop!)  Maybe there are more, but they don't seem to be on coinmap.org.   Plus Madison's was sold or shutdown, so I don't know if they still take BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:59:14
Bought a pair of jeans, some socks, and a sweet limited edition Brooks saddle.  About 0.75 BTC.

I'm president of an ISP in Portland, OR.  Our services are offered globally.  We've been accepting and holding Bitcoin since May 2013.   
Edit: We also accept Litecoin and Dogecoin and give 10% off services paid for via crypto currencies.
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:17:24
I'm back!  There are so many worthy projects and donations, very cool!  Therefore, I'm increasing the giveaway, and will provide a free VPS to every project and donator so far. :)  
Please be patient while they are setup and the emails are sent out, I have limited time today.  
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:55:31
Great goal.  I hope you can contribute to that or at least learn something and have fun trying. :)  
Your VPS is up.  It comes with 5 IPs.  If you need more let me know.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:14:00

I run a Tor exit node and changed my ContactInfo line to this format:

Sent a HUP signal to tor and already received a nice donation, which is crazy because I did this an hour or two ago and never mentioned it anywhere. :o

Hi.  Did you follow steps 1, 2, and 3? :)
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:16:58
If you need a VPS for your project, I can give you a free one, as mentioned  here: 
Just send me a message with an email address so I can send you the login info.  I haven't been able to load oniontip.com all day.

Your Bitcoin public address needs to be on your website, otherwise the experiment has already failed.   Where's the payment info?
@_date: 2014-05-29 02:53:39
So, if something on your site is advertised at 99GBP, the price for a USA order would be about 79.2 GBP?  Or would it still be 99GBP, but in EU the actual price is 118.8 GBP including VAT?  Nice site.  
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:12:24
Well, it's been a few weeks and I love your stuff!  My wife does too.  Lip balm and moisturizer are amazing she says, and also your deodorant is the best working natural deodorant she's ever used.  It smells yummy too :)

TL;DR: iOS had an SSL verification bug when using public wi-fi.  Already fixed in latest iOS.

@_date: 2014-07-06 03:15:29
Yes!  Free means you get a VPS for 12 months for donating $6 to a charity of your choice.
The donation is really only to keep down the number of bogus requests for the free vps.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:13:17
You've got the VPS, setup whatever you want! :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:17:29

Actually, that page says 1000GB and 2000GB of Bandwidth, aka Monthly data transfer.  The free VPS here includes 5000GB's (5TB) of monthly data transfer.
The '10Mbps' number is the port speed.  The port speeds will probably be higher than this though.  
@_date: 2014-03-19 00:28:32
Something like this?
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:57:18
I tried your portal and your server login and both worked.  Copy and paste?

Here's one with 'bitcoin' instead of r/bitcoin:
edit: This has an increased DPI for printing on t-shirts.  I had four shirts made at Zazzle and they are fantastic.  Zazzle prints the ink directly into the shirt fibers... very nice and hasn't faded after 12 months.
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:31:48
Would there be a way to get OnionTip integrated with TorBrowser?  That would create an ongoing revenue stream for the volunteers running Tor nodes.  It's nice to get some donations while this is at the top of r/bitcoin every few months, but the rest of the time there are virtually no donations.

'Free VPS' just sounds so spammy though...
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:28:08
Unfortunately I just don't have the capacity for that.  
I already added a 500GB SSD from my personal pocketbook.   With all the other VPS's using resources too, I don't want to unfairly give a larger percentage to one user/project.  
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:34:21
Awesome :)
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:26:18
Press once the screen to focus (on the QR code). 
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:09:47
Should exit nodes get a higher percentage?  They are definitely needed more than relay nodes and have much higher risk for the operators. :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:22:27
Craziness, I like it!  Your VPS is up. :)
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:52:18
Please change your donation form to allow any donation amount.  I would like to send more than 0.02 BTC and I'm sure many others would too.
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:04:25
Now my &gt;0.02 BTC is gone.  Had to test it though :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:41:10
Yea that might work...   Unfortunately it would ruin my real business, my reputation, and absolutely would not make me as much money as what I already do and love.  Someone else can be the scammer, I will be the good guy.  Secure your shit.
TLDR: trust no one.
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:37:47

As the owner of an ISP since 1993, looking at other peoples data got boring a LONG time ago.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:18:23
It sounds to me like they are hosting an ATM.  That's not the same as 'accepting' Bitcoin.

I placed an order anyhow....  Best Bitcoin checkout process ever!  However the buttoni that says "Bitcoin accepted here" should maybe say 'Pay with Bitcoin' instead?  If you choose "Checkout" it takes you to credit card payments with no Bitcoin option.  Ever so slightly confusing.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:25:15
Yea I dont like bits either tbh.  it was $7 at the time. :)

Hi.  Whats your project? :)
@_date: 2014-09-28 01:23:33
Sweet! I received over 18000 bits from that tip :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:18:46
What?  the answer is yes....
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:57:30
In regards to cart owners:
1) Give them a flyer explaining the benefits of Bitcoin and how to use a smartphone to accept payments.  
2) Also throw in 'Bitcoin accepted here' stickers.   
3) Add them to coinmap? 
Would there be someway to generate a QR code on the spot for them and laminate it?!?  Sometimes phones go dead, or reception is shitty, or their app breaks and a simple paper QR code would always function.
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:02:53
Your custom item descriptions are fantastic.
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:31:57

Feature requests:
* Allow entering (via iOS keyboard) a Bitcoin address manually for sends. 
* Allow passwords as opposed to only pin numbers.
* Allow changing Bitcoin unit display from Bits to other denominations.
* Add a small delay between PIN requests?
* Currently if you bring up the Control Center (say to adjust screen brightness) bread requires you to re-enter your PIN.  That shouldn't happen.

All the product reviews on your website sound like they've been written by the same person.
Every single reviewer on your website has rated each product '5 stars' in every review.  Not even a single 4 star review.   What are the odds of having 100+ '5 star' reviews and no 1,2,3, or 4 star reviews?
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:04:58
Can you add a way to input a dollar amount during a send? 
Many establishments I frequent have a static QR code for accepting payments.  If they ask me to pay $12 for a meal, I have to trial and error the BTC amount in Blockchain out to the needed decimal precision...  Really makes it hard to send a USD amount in BTC.
 Coinpocket does this elegantly by having a button near the entered amount that toggles the entry amount between BTC and USD (or whatever your local currency).
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:08:34
Can you make the front page of oniontip.com show some relays by default (without pressing Update)?
@_date: 2014-07-07 02:11:11
FYI, I'm moving some VPS's (the ones running full Bitcoin nodes) to a larger SSD.  If your VPS is moved, it will be paused for a few minutes while the files copy, and possibly restarted if the resume fails.

FYI: If you are already paying a VPS provider who accepts Bitcoin, I feel it would hurt the Bitcoin economy to switch to this free VPS offer.  So I'll probably decline to host you if that's the case.

Have you ever been concerned that you might not be able to freely express yourself in r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-17 04:50:02
all the projects (90% were not nodes) were in the same server and network.  when an xt node was ddos'd the entire network is affected.  i could have gotten rid of the nodes only, but at the time i was so frustrated with the attacks i just shut the entire server off to protect my business that was being affected.  i can null route the node being attacked but it still causes short outages that are not cool with clients who expect 99.999% uptime.
its easy to tell what the attacks were directed at because each vps has a unique IP address.

The "support" is non-organic. It's a few Classic players buying lots of nodes, buying advertising, and creating the notion of support.
First I want to say I totally support you when you express that you disagree with "the fact that Classic is gaining more support".  I like to hear opinions, especially if they are interesting and differ from my own.
It sounds like you're saying support gained through advertising is not support?   That seems like an odd stance to me because Bitcoin has been using paid advertising for years to gain support.  It gained huge support through paid ads on reddit, for example. 
Support has to be organic to be good?  So if a large company invests in Bitcoin, does it not count as support because it's not "organic"?  I seem to recall this subreddit exploding everytime a company got involved with Bitcoin, organic or not organic.  
It's bad that Classic supporters buy nodes?  Really?  Would you rather everyone who supports Classic "organically", twiddle their thumbs offline because their Classic node was attacked and therefore they've been denied the ability to be on the Internet and Reddit?  That sure would be convenient for anyone who had an opposing view!

Xt nodes were targeted (there were three or four running out of the 42 vps's).  bitcoin core nodes were not attacked.  the other 36 projects were not nodes and were not attacked.
@_date: 2016-03-17 00:09:25
Ouch.  I'm sad you think all of r/bitcoin is better off without me.  I do shit like this: 
And right now I'm paying for development of an open source bitcoind/whmcs payment gateway that is free and doesnt require any 3rd parties.
I almost never come here anymore because the ratio of manipulation, censorship, lies, and attacks -- to worthwhile content, is too high for me.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:18:15
I'm not sure that's the case.  At this point the attack is backfiring because classic is gaining more and more support (somewhat due to the fact that it IS being attacked).  Why would a "Core supporter" keep paying for an attack thats obviously not working?
@_date: 2016-03-17 04:52:08
if i was to do this sort of thing again in the current state of affairs I would have to not allow anyone to run bitcoin nodes because they are being targeted.  It sucks.  I'm disappointed that we can't be free to choose without being terrorized.  DDoS is soley destructive and stupid.
@_date: 2014-07-05 23:46:32
I suppose it couldn't hurt...    But anything hosted at any datacenter worldwide is at the whim of the datacenter operators.  Really, anything connected to the internet should not be trusted.
When dealing with untrusted systems, I suggest strong encryption.   
Edit: added a disclaimer here and at the top of the welcome email being sent to everyone.
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:45:02


Sorry I thought that was clear.  DDoS is a network-based attack, it can't actually shutdown a project or power off a server.  A human being (me) has to actually shut them down in order to protect the rest of the network.
It's funny that you are trying to make it sound like I had a choice.  I don't know what your life experiences are, or what internet businesses you've ran before, but when a free service is being attacked and its taking down your real business you step in and shut it down. 
Maybe if I put it in other terms, you might get it:  If you were a lawyer and a pro bono case took all your time so that all your paying clients left, your business would fold, and then you couldn't work on the pro bono case either because you'd be living on the street.  The pro bono case was the bitcoin projects and the clients leaving is the ddos.


You want packet logs?  You want screen shots of bandwidth spikes that have "XT NODE" photoshopped onto them?  I have those things.  Billions of bytes of it.  It's also easily faked and is not going to be "evidence".  This isn't a court of law.
The evidence is me.  I'm a verifiable real person, running an ISP for 20 years, saying on my word and honor what has gone on.  Every individual will choose to believe, or not, on the merits of what I've written, and what you've written.  I believe and trust that people are good at seeing what is true, and what's not.

Wow, there are a lot more servers with port 49150 open than I would have guessed.
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:44:08
Scanned 47% of 4.3 billion IPs in 2 hours [masscan 0.0.0.0/0 -p49150 --max-rate 10000000 --exclude 255.255.255.255] (Sent 120GB's of data averaging 140Mbps).  1 million IPs had port 49150 open. The list of 1 million IP's is 15MB's.   It would take more than an hour to make the code I need to finish...   At $20/hr so far and more time needed.   Rewards not big enough for this!  /quit

Hmm...  my string send script only does 5 hosts per second so that would take 38 hours to check the 30% of the internet ive scanned so far...  need to speed that up by one or two magnitudes...

shopping at whole foods with the existing options (gyft, egifter) is a PITA.  Neither show your card balance and usually the cashiers cant scan your barcode and have to type it in by hand.  Doing this with two or even three cards makes it cumbersome.  Plus I hate handing anyone my precious phone.  With Fold at Starbucks it shows your current balance and you just hold your phone up to the scanner and are done.
Fold with Whole Foods on iOS please!

Owner of an ISP here.  I had to shutoff a client running a Bitcoin node due to a 6.5 Gbps DDoS a few days ago.   I was hosting their node for free.  When a DDoS affects your entire business, you just turn off the client, forever.
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:03:14
Hi all.
Sad to say, I have discontinued the free hosting.  Too much DDoS.
If you want any of your data from the server, let me know.
So long.
