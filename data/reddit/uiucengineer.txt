Cash advance fee is completely separate from APR.

Sure it is, but bitcoin doesn’t have a government behind it, and that is a difference. And it’s a big one.

That’s exactly what he meant when he said timing is only obvious in retrospect. You would have had no way of knowing what you posted. It could crash tomorrow and never recover.

Seems like a pretty likely eventuality, and you don’t know when it will happen.

I’m not?

The merchant wouldn’t be charging you an APR.

That isn’t just collectively agreed upon—it is enforced by a government with a very powerful military.

That’s what cryptocurrency is right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:22:13
Are you saying cryptocurrency is not a currency? I’m confused.

That is why I don’t think it will really work.  A collective agreement doesn’t seem very reliable.

Also the converse about write-offs. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:14:45
I’m honestly not sure what you were trying to say
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:56:15
Is this a joke? Have you ever tried to get a group of people to agree on something?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:41:31
The difference is the dollar has a very powerful military behind it to remind people of its value, in case anyone should forget.

You have no liberty to the bank’s money, as a man or otherwise. If you don’t understand that, you have no business making speculative “investments” on credit. I mean, probably nobody does—but *especially* not you.

More precisely, they are afraid of people gambling on crypto, losing, going bankrupt, and leaving them holding the bag. There’s no logical conspiratorial reason for them to be “afraid of crypto”. If it does take off someday, that isn’t going to change the need for credit services.

Can’t lose much? What nonsense is that?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:14:21
It’s the bank’s money and they have every right to tell you not to gamble with it on crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:47:08
No—you can lose however much you can put into it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:36:54
Apparently the banks disagree.
