Ok, so I'm not as well versed as some other people on this sub but I'm going to take a stab at answering your concerns.
1) mycelium (as I currently understand it) functions as a lightweigh SPV wallet. I personally use breadwallet because it's a bit easier. That 12 word phrase is your seed. From that seed all of your public and private keys are mathematically derived. You are in charge of your private keys. They are on whatever device you have mycelium installed on. You don't have to worry about the website shutting down or anything crazy like that as long as the software on your phone still works. I'm not sure what the type of seed the 12 word phrase is. You may be able to type in into electrum on a computer and get the same addresses. 
2) Security is something that you are in control of. If your friend feels comfortable putting those bitcoins in coinbase's control, then that is a risk he can take. I personally like being in control of my private keys. for such a large amount of money, I would recommend sending those funds to a multi sig wallet. he can make the transactions on one computer and then complete the transaction signing process on an air gapped computer. then he can send those transactions onto the block chain. There are so many different ways to handle this, but it really comes down to how available you want the funds to be. 
3) I would recommend that you go to [bitaddress.org]( and create some paper wallets. They are literally addresses that you print. bread wallet will let you import the private key via qr that is printed so that they can spend directly from bread wallet.
I will be glad to answer anymore questions you have but if you feel so inclined....1BxqTC4T5dfssPXP63QBL4WMCxBQruA8d8
