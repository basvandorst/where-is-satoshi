Seems like they've over-engineered this. Having a GSM radio is just not necessary and not available worldwide.
Fingerprint sensor is great though. Trezor + QR scanner + fingerprint + a way to proxy signed transactions via a merchant terminal or your own phone for in-store purchasing seems to be the most sensible way to go... I'd buy one.
The thing is though we already have the above... it's called a mobile phone. A mobile with a bitcoin secure element would be the way to go, hopefully 21/qualcomm will make that happen.

Generate the wallet, print the backup, delete the wallet, restore from backup...
That way you KNOW 100% that you're not gonna have a problem later on, and you can delete it again knowing that.
EDIT: definitely look into piper67's idea. Offline Armory is the best way to use Armory! All you need is an old laptop that you can dedicate to your offline wallet. There's many tutorials around for setting this up.

Connect the miner directly to the laptop/pc with an ethernet cable and do the following
Set the IP to something like 192.168.1.50, subnet mask 255.255.255.0, leave gateway blank, leave dns blank.
Now go to your browser and try and login to the antminer at 192.168.1.99. I forget exactly where the settings are in there but somewhere you'll be able to set the IP to the range of your network.
If you don't know what your network range is, go to start -&gt; run -&gt; cmd  (enter). then type ipconfig. This will show the IP assigned to you by your router.  
Once this is done you can set your PC's ip back to 'obtain automatically' and plug the miner into your router.

It's good practice to watermark or designate ID for a particular date or use anyway, as it saves it being used for other purposes were it to find its way into the public domain. 
Your complaints about them not letting you withdraw straight away though, they're trying to save your ass and you're complaining! If they'd not done any of this and your coins had been stolen, you'd be posting about how poor their security is, so really they can't win. YOU lost your 2FA, THEY are being prudent in not allowing full access to the account straight away.... Exactly what they should be doing. Resetting 2FA is a big deal, not an everyday occurrence. Print your 2FA seed, store it somewhere safe.

Thanks for the clarification. Thing is though, in a closed-source ecosystem such as the appstore, it's not Bitstamp's API that needs to be trusted: It's both yourself and anyone who has access (or gains access) to your Apple Developer account. Saying that, if it's made clear to new users that they don't need (and perhaps shouldn't) grant withdrawal privileges then fair enough.
Not to bash you, looks like a fine app and is clearly needed.

Unless your PC is very old and doesn't have MDI Autosensing, yes it should be flashing.
In this case, I'd suggest a possibly easier option. Plug the miner into the router. Go into your router settings. Set the router's IP to 192.168.1.1. Save settings and reboot router. When it comes back up you should be able to get to the miner.

Is your network on the same subnet? ie 192.168.1.xxx? If not, you'll have to plug the miner directly into your pc/laptop, set a static IP in the above range then change the settings on the antminer to match your network (generally 192.168.0.xxx)

PayPal, especially for eBay purchases, prides itself on being reversible and constantly shielding the Buyer rather than the Seller (even when the Buyer is in the wrong, or an obvious scammer). That's speaking from experience, I've lost over £1000 in 10 years thanks to PayPal chargebacks that were overwhelmingly in my favour.
Bitcoin, as we all know, is not compatible with this ethos. Given time, and when/if PayPal enable bitcoin within their own system, they can manage this risk of chargeback. In fact, it will work to their advantage.

I guess they're talking about millions of devices, i.e the IOT. In which case, it would make a sizable dent.
Bitcoin ASIC silicon has been continuously reaching obsolescence because they've been made on old-tech nodes because fabs haven't taken the industry seriously and because of competition. Now they're reaching current nodes (14nm, next year maybe 10nm), this will slow down. 
In this respect, Intel and Qualcomm are good allies to have!
That said, I hate all these buzzwords... and 21's pitch seems wholly based on them.

Always had this problem when Armory was setup to run bitcoind itself (default setting).
Start Bitcoin QT standalone. If that syncs up, start armory, ignore the errors, go to settings and specify "I will handle Bitcoin Core myself".
Much better anyway, because you can keep core running and staying up to date without having to load up armory into memory.

They admitted compromised coins, not necessarily the 18k people are looking it. Anyone can tag an address. You said stolen coins were sold.  Where? IF the 18k is the thief's haul, then those coins haven't even moved let alone been sold.
Do you really believe a hacker is stupid enough to sell the coins they stole from Bitstamp, on Bitstamp?!

@_date: 2015-05-05 22:57:03
Thats correct. your seed contains the 'instructions' for generating all past and future addresses in your wallet. Armory does not generate any addresses from the seed until you ask it to. As you've just imported the seed to a new setup it has no idea which addresses you've used previously. Add a few addresses with 'Receive Bitcoins' and see what happens.
You may have to rescan or maybe just restart armory

Erik, I have much respect for you, you're one of the original Bitcoin gang that hasn't been swept up by Ver's nonsense.
But you must realise at this point that BU is not a push for what you're asking for (or indeed any sensible outcome), it has become purely a power play.
I too would be all for a 2MB+SW HF if this would end all this uncertainty. If Core were to offer this up, would go crazy with "BlockStreamAXACore U-turns now BU is winning, we're winning guys, lets finish this". This crowd can turn anything into an Anti-core message, even staggering vulnerabilities in their code.
Jonny is right. Bitcoin's entire value proposition is destroyed if 1 or 2 people can rally support and carry out a complete redesign of its fundamentals.

On a small scale, ASICs are not going to make you a lot of money. That's why it's generally done on a huge scale by people in locations that have cheap power and who also have a lot of capital. 
The people that were running huge GPU rigs back in the day made a lot of dough, but such rigs today are just expensive heaters... The game changed in 2013, maybe 2012 if you put FPGAs in the mix.

The transaction has a decent enough fee but has unconfirmed outputs. Think of it as the person sending you money that hasn't yet cleared. It should be showing in your wallet as pending though, what wallet are you using?
For future reference, blanking out your address is useless in this case as you've shown the sending address and the amount...
EDIT: There is a chain of about 20 unconfirmed transactions for the coins you've been sent... you may be waiting a while!

While you're likely correct about the outcome, as is usually the case with legacy integration, the cardholder agreement you've linked to (and, in fairness, they have too) is for plastic MyChoice cards. Online only non-reloadable cards, with a $100 limit do not fall under particularly strict KYC/AML as they're more like gift cards (Not sure about US, but the EU are planning to outlaw anonymous use of prepaid cards)

I must admit that I actually quite enjoy reading your replies to technical misunderstandings on rbtc, but I can't help but think that if you ignored rbtc completely, it would probably die a death.

1. Not sure if you mean dollars or coins. If you mean dollars, fairly easy. If you mean BTC, thats 528 Million dollars, so probably not so easy!
2. Simply put, no. Mining is now the preserve of custom hardware, no GPU or CPU is fast in mining standards... you will burn more in electricity than you will make back.
@_date: 2016-12-01 00:26:59
Hard to tell, the fees are 0.0001 on all the transactions. I don't use coinbase but see no reason why it shouldn't be showing in your wallet as unconfirmed

I didn't say there was no requirement for ID, I said it's less strict than for reloadable plastic cards to which that agreement relates. It will almost certainly get shut down once it gains traction, as have so many others. It's not possible to purchase prepaid cards online anonymously because there are no anonymous payment methods (accepted directly), but you can purchase prepaid cards with cash and with no ID (legitimately, in large stores) and this is probably the closest you can get to the Shakepay setup.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:16:45
If you don't have a seed yet and therefore have no funds stored by the trezor, then now is the perfect time to update the firmware. Once you update, run through the setup process on screen (make sure you write down AND check the seed, this is extremely important).
Then go to mytrezor.com, install the chrome plugin... and boom, you're done.

I think he does. A cold wallet cannot be transferred to the hot wallet automatically (without any user input). That's a lukewarm wallet, a.k.a lazy cold storage. The real problem is that MtGox's system was automatically re-attempting to push withdrawals that it thought had failed (due to mal txid) but not using the same inputs. Bad cold storage was the icing on the cake.

Well if it's for a rental, that delay is probably by design. They've preauthed the transaction to be processed at the end of the period (subject to you not destroying the car). This is pretty standard practice to allow them to hold a deposit.
It's up to the merchant to complete the transaction after auth.

Its not just bitcoin, UK banks stifle access to the payment networks for new banks too as seen here with Fidor. The 4 sponsoring banks don't want the competition. Metro bank is on the Faster Payment rails, they only problem is that they're not fast, they take about 2 hours (contrast this with payments between the sponsor banks, instant).
Makes it useless for localbitcoins, and annoying when transferring money between accounts.
Hopefully the new kid on the block, Virgin bank (who acquired Northern Rock), will be a bit more litigious.
As for neteller, I really hope they don't just back down and allow this to happen. You can fund a neteller card anonymously with paysafecard or ukash, yet bitcoin is not allowed? Pathetic. It's because bitcoin is a threat.

They have probably the best track record of any of the early exchanges. They hardly ever have downtime. They know what they're doing and they do it pretty well.
Sure, it might end in tears, but so could any exchange.. anonymous or otherwise.
Considering they don't have the cost of compliance to deal with, they're actually making good money. They'd have to be brain dead to cut and run.
I sympathise with OPs problem, they are awful at CS
EDIT: also, gox weren't anonymous, but look how useful that difference turned out to be. Gox were inept and out of their depth.

Barclays will shortly be banking Coinbase in the UK. That’s a tall order and a lot of volume, so I don’t think they can be that hostile in general.

I now start Bitcoin core (bitcoin-qt not bitcoind) with -disablewallet (and -checkblocks=100 which speeds things up sacrificing a bit of security) and start Armory with ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Armory\ArmoryQt.exe" --satoshi-datadir="F:\coinstuff\bitcoin" --datadir="F:\coinstuff\Armory") as I have the datadirs on a different HDD because my SSD isn't big enough.
No problems since and it means I can keep Core running and staying up to date without having to keep Armory's huge footprint in memory.
EDIT: I'm using the older version btw, because 'if it ain't broke don't fix it', but i'm guessing the above should work too

The premium reflects the risk. It's up to you. I've contemplated it but don't believe they will get their banking facilities back anytime soon and expect a few more exchanges to have this problem. It seems to be LHV that is banking most the western exchanges, and if that goes belly up....

I always thought that LE throwing murder-for-hire in to sway a jury was tinfoil hat stuff... Just goes to show. 
One thing it does show is that LE have really got their shit together when it comes to blockchain analysis (admittedly because they can subpoena the ass out of the exchanges). You'd think they'd be pushing for bitcoin adoption, it sure makes it easier for them than tracking cash. 
EDIT: WOW nice find... fucking incredible. They knew all the time!

It's not a good idea to use PayPal because it is easily reversed and is a well used vector for scamming people out of coins. Highly recommend finding another way, either cash trade with someone local, bank deposit, bank transfer etc.

If you have to use PayPal, you can deposit to  buy SLL. convert to BTC and then withdraw the BTC to your wallet. It's not ideal, and you may lose a few percent..

Doesn't really answer the question. Do you have any proof for anything you've said? I never have and never will use Bter, but still.

It hasn't been reversed but the SEC have agreed to review their decision and then deny it again.

While obviously it's poor that they haven't got back to you, you must have known that depositing with an account not in your name would cause issues? Put yourself in their position, it looks scammy as fuck.

Xt and classic failed. If you have coins in that wallet, they're bitcoin proper
Load it into bitcoin core (and dump the keys to something else if you don't wanna wait for sync)

The thing that would put me off is all the nonsense alts, they're just clutter. Even litecoin would be a step to far, there's already crypto to crypto exchanges that people can use to convert all the rubbish alts. What UK needs is a fiat BTC exchange with FPS.

CSW is a complete charlatan. It's so obvious that it's painful. Thanks for posting the video, it was forking hilarious.
I can't decipher whether this guy has some mental health issues or is just purely a scammer.

What an incredible read that was. So brazen and so stupid. Especially signing off with DPR as Carl and then saying "whoops, i meant Carla".
Bitstamp come out of it quite well, constantly asking questions (despite eventually wiring a significant amount of money).. 
All in all... Shocking.

Expect it's going to be a volatile few days. People loading up on BTC so they can get more BCC freebies to dump. Once they've split the BCC they can sell the "excess" BTC again. At least, that's what i'm doing.

I see nothing unprofessional about their CS from your post, just that they are efficient. Neteller has always required basic verification, and has never been advertised here or elsewhere as anonymous. I'm not sure why you or anyone else would assume that it would be.

Can you disclose your banking partner? This will be about the fourth time I've seen an exchange gain then quickly lose FPS. The ones that still have it have zero volume (hence why they've kept it)
