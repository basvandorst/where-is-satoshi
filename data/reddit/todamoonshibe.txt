when will regular people feel the change with LN (fees and transaction speed ?

price of coins has been going up , fees should be going down . Not to mention the poor volume. I Still love Quadriga and use them , but not for trading.

not saying one is better than the other but BTC unconfirmed transactions , speed and fees are horrible right now compare to ETH...and ETH now process the double of transactions per day than BTC...

not sure if it will ever be a currency ... it s too volatile , i want it to grow in value , therefore it s hard for me to spend it if i think it will gain value... and it will gain value if it scale..

fees are too high

To be honest , i hodl BTC but my experience with buying stuff with BTC on internet turned out to be poor . credit never screwed me.

this is a great question. All of this drama and the tech guys on here are like BIP this BIP that and for them everything seems easy but for someone like me who trade , but not nerd enough to understand the difference between both coins and take the time to convert the coins , then i think most simple thing to do is sell and buy back later.
