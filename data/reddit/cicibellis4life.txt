What does sw mean?

Did you purchase/mine coins when they were pennies on the dollar? When did you sell?

I’m guessing you live somewhere else besides the US? Can I ask what country you’re from? I don’t think there are too many American banks where a local branch would have that much cash on them. Or are you referring to just arranging the wire transfer to your account?

It was from huzlers. They are a tabloid site that likes to make fun of popular trending topics.

Yeah, bank wires should be no problem. I guess cash depends on the bank branch itself. I once withdrew $20k for a Asia trip and had to come back 3 days later to get the cash.

Back then, what was the process like to get a bitcoin wallet address, buy or sell to other users, etc? Major online exchanges like Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc weren’t around yet. Were the majority using paper wallets?
I just bought some bitcoin a few months ago, so relatively new to this.

Oh okay. Do you see litecoin making a big move soon, with its quicker block times and being more energy efficient to mine? Are there any altcoins the general public has never heard of that you see gaining traction next year?

So 2,100 days to break even, and that’s not including any costs for using the USB stick (are there any?).

If you’re seriously asking this question. FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. Basically, when there’s bad news about Bitcoin in the public media, there’s concern about the price dropping due to it. 
HODL started on the Bitcointalk message boards. Someone made a drunk post about hodling instead of holding, and it became a meme after that. Bitcoin users ran with it, and made it their own slang.

Got it. Thanks.

Could these smaller mining devices be configured to mine coins like Monero, which can be mined by a CPU and are less exhausting to do? Or do they only work for Bitcoin?

So the individual or group that used the name Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and has about 1 million actual Bitcoins stored somewhere. I’m guessing even though they believed in the idea of a decentralized payment method, they never guessed Bitcoin would actually be worth this much in less than a decade. Do you think whoever Satoshi is, whether they are alive now, ever intended to spend their million Bitcoins if it became this valuable, which it obviously now has?

What’s expected to happen on Monday? I know the Dow Jones was down over 2 percent yesterday, but is Monday supposed to be worse? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:30:41
Off topic, but Sunday is the Super Bowl. And as always, there’s a ton of side bets on the game. One is whether the Dow Jones will be up or down on Monday (final closing price up or down percentage). Are you sure of a down price for Monday? Why so certain? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:23:10
Oh okay. I wonder out of the 16.7 million or so Bitcoins currently mined, how many have been lost and forgotten? There must have been quite a few people in the early days who bought coins for pennies on the dollar, and lost some of them, or lost their wallets, and now it will never be found and recovered. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:50:09
What happens on the 23rd?
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:40:14
Why would his coins being used and moved be worse than just sitting there lost and unrecoverable? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:26:52
So you see the price hovering around 7.5 to 8k, then dropping to where?
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:18:32
So you expect Bitcoin to sink along with this by the end of Monday? It was around $7,500 early yesterday morning, about 9k now after a rise. Where do you see the price by say midnight Tuesday morning?

How do you verbally pronounce HODL or Hodler? Is it a short o or a long o sound?
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:39:14
Is $9 the minimum charge, or is it $9 for every $20 purchased? How much would it cost at your ATM to purchase $100, $1,000 etc?
