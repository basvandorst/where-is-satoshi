I think you invested your money in a failed investment and instead of taking personal responsibility over your bad call you have now concocted a crazy person theory to explain why you were wrong about the price of bitcoin.

sorry for your loss

You get that QQ points, linden dollars and WoW gold all do more transactions per month than bitcoin has done in half a decade, right?

Not state backed, but yes, an organization larger than bitcoin will eventually release their own cryptocurrency. And then people invested in bitcoin will turn red in the face and yell network effect means this is impossible! as it gets more users in one day than bitcoin has gotten in six years.

Globalization and libertarianism are both things he was solidly against.

Has a risk of not being orphaned as well, especially if they mine the next block as well.

Cool fan fiction, but you know it's true, bitcoin has aquired barely any users in 6 years, even a failed rival project could get more than bitcoin.

I got sold on bitcoin on the idea it was governed by math. Turns out it's the same as the old system where people are going to be just making economic decisions manually. 
boring.

Yeah just put all your money into bitcoin and you will get free money out. Bitcoin is just a way to buy fake money then randomly wait to sell it for real money. Everyone can get rich with bitcoins!

Is the sort of advertising where changetip buys employment of a mod still okay? 
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:54:47
Saying "it won't change" doesn't magically make something immune to changing. If bitcoin goes mainstream the mainstream users will out number the libertarian early adopters a million to one.

It's fun that people have found a way to cheer stagnation. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:54:23
It's important to many people here because they have a plan to buy it, wait till it is randomly worth more for some reason and then sell it so they become wealthy with little work.

Getting in 18 months after the peak of a fad investment is how all billionares got that way!
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:12:54
The envy arguement makes very little sense. The price now is lower than the price a vast majority of people got into bitcoin.  Anyone getting in now is far better off than anyone getting in in the last two years. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:07:56
Wait, so how is it stable? 
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:23:42
Hey everyone, just keep all your money in this free thing we gave you, there is no way that can go wrong!
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:40:55
The average block size is still less than 1/3rd of 1 mb. The idea there is a looming crisis is based on a concept that a billion mainstream users are about to break in here any second. While that could happen it's far less urgant than people pretend if bitcoin keeps growing at the rate it has grown at. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:58:06
This is why it's really good that 1 person holds 10% of all bitcoin wealth, 5 people hold a third and 750,000 people hold 100%. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:35:12
You may have missed your chance to get rich just buying bitcoin. It might not be a get rich ticket after all.

Stop trying to co opt gandhi stuff, he wouldn't have been pro bitcoin at all.
