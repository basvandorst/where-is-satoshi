I keep wondering besides Trump, tether has something to do with this. I completely understand pullbacks. The amount of volume being sold all at once is what baffles me.

Crypto is dead.

Truth, easy to use technology for the masses is at least 10 years away. Let’s be real what has bitcoin and blockchain brought us besides a ledger and “decentralization”? Decentralization with a mask to fool us to be really free from banks. Too many greedy people so in that case blockchain is dead as of right now.

No it won’t, the moment we let Wall Street in we fucked ourselves. December 2017 was the highest you will ever see it be. Truth!

As far I am concerned of, the government has  not given any new tax laws or or special tax breaks to companies like the one you mention. So either way you’re going to pay, either by fees the companies are going to charge you or by yourself going through those hoops. Personally I would prefer to have control of my own crypto assets then let some middle man control it.

So they are pretty much just holding crypto you buy from a existing 401k IRA on a regular basis. 
Why don’t you just buy you’re own crypto on a regular basis and keep it on cold storage then don’t cash out until your 65 lol. 
This idea that this CEO came up with is a waste of time, he is just a middle man which is the very thing we are trying to rid of. 
It’s like “decentralized” exchanges that need a KYC form done which defeats the very purpose of it being decentralized. 
It’s just extra step.

So, take this news with a grain of salt!!! And if it’s even near the truth, than you should be very scared and sell all your BTC once they buy “25%”!!!
Based of simple math, here’s is a list of people who can even consider buying that much all at once. 
List follow as:
1.Jeff Bezos
2.Bill Gates
3.Warren Buffet
4.Bernard Arnault
5.Carlos Slim Helu 
6.Amancio Ortego
7.Larry Ellison 
8.Mark Zuckerberg 
9.Michael Bloomberg
10.Larry Page
11.Charles Koch
12.David Koch
13.Muchesh Ambani
14.Sergey Brin
15.Francoise 
16.Jim Walton
17.Alice Walton
19.Rob Walton
To be honest, F3ćk all these people!!! They already have everything they need and want anything after the fact is pure greed. So like I mention before if this story is even close to the truth then bitcoin will become useless in the very fact for what it’s meant for. BITCOIN WILL THEN BECOME CENTRALIZED. 
The shit will climb extremely fast �� and that’s when you should sell. Shorty after bitcoin will crash and become useless.
