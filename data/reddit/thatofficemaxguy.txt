Curious question....
Has anyone had any thoughts on what the cryptocurrency market(s) will look like if/when we have another global recession? Since early 2016 i've been on the thought that we will hit one that builds quickly towards mid/end 2018 and into 2019. And it seems a lot of discussions are starting to build towards that.
With that, my initial thought is that cryptos could explode with other markets falling and people look for a place to park money. If we assume that's the case, makes me wonder if we are actually in for some even more insane growth. 
Am I way off base here or does anyone else have similar thoughts?
Extra note, i'm actually not in bitcoin yet. But I do have some stake in others though. Personally used to think bitcoin was just a bit overcooked and didnt want to get stuck in a correction. But every day that goes by I realize how wrong I was.

Futures open up mid day on the 11th globally, but that works to mid day the 10th for a lot of people here. Those thinking/wanting a bubble to pop are thinking itll happen the before the futures open.

Oh i'm for sure getting in with Bitcoin and I wasn't advocating for anyone to *not*. I'm assuming there will be a mild pull back going into the weekend, which is when ill probably jump in a bit.
Guess my real question here is what will happen with cryptos when entering a global recession. It'll be the first time it's a thing entering one, so it's very much a curiosity. People like to dump stocks for gold before, but im starting to think people will go to cryptos with the next one.
