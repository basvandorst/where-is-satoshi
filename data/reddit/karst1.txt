In physical shops, I almost never use bitcoins.
When it comes to eCommerce sites, paying with bitcoins is the only way to pay for me. I have a debit crad without online payment possibilities, other than bank wire. Therefor I only use bitcoins online.
Then again, I will not buy anything because you accept bitcoins. I will buy something because you have a great product and accept bitcoins.

Just use Satoshi.

Are you one of the Justcoin guys?
If so, your site is wonderful. I really like doing business there.
Any chance of you creating a payment system similar to Bitpay's? That way I could recieve my BTC payments in NOK.

My response to that misconception is that one bitcoin is simply what people  call 100 million satoshi, and that there are several names for different amount of satoshi. For example mBTC, which is 100 thousand satoshi.

Can I use Ledger on a computer that is compromised?
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:03:51
This is impossible without ruining the coin.

Did you just give away 1347 mBits?

Why can't we use all of them? dBTC, cBTC, mBTC and µBTC.

Fees are very useful.
Taxes are destructive.

Why is it hard and costly?
Why will it be more expensive in the future?
Thanks :)

Always give bitcoin paper wallets as a *secondary* gift.
"That's too expensive!"
Give them 1000 microbits, they won't care about the price anyway.

To use email as an authenticator is as secure as sending money with a postcard.
You shouldn't send money with a postcard.

Winter and easter are best. Last year's easter was perfect, sun every day and a looot of snow.

No thanks.

Some of their products are so cheap that I think it would be best to price them in uBTC (microbits).
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:08:17
I downloaded Coinbits for iPhone and started tracking my local exchange (Justcoin), this is the only logical thing to do as it's my only way to buy/sell coins.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:59:35
This is actually likely - unless one of them gives to someone else to verify.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:56:08

What you're describing as 'capitalism' is what libertarians call 'crony capitalism'. Everyone's against it.

Step 1: invest 5% in Bitcoin.
Step 3: all the other ideas in this thread.

If you upload the code to github, I'll help you for free.
Or just send me the files and I'll upload them.

You could start by begging for a dogecoin tip and learn in an environment of jokes.

0.001 BTC forever would be sufficient.
