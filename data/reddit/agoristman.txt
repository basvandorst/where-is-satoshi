merry christmas to you.

Can I get a invite to start using circle?

You could say the same about usd, I can hoard it and reap the rewards of compound interest on my government issued t-bills.

I'd imagine it would work with at least visa a mastercard in canada. They share payment networks with the states.

What comes next? Read "The Creature From Jekyll Island". It wouldn't surprise me to see the euro collapse and be consolidated into the dollar. From there, the World Bank and the IMF take over and institute a global fiat currency. Imagine the fed, just larger in scope.

Whats the name of the food truck?

1) Maybe we should do something simular in nature to the cispa black out. Say you run a store/service and you receive 90% of your revenue via fiat, decline those customers and prompt them with a page simular to weusecoins.org and request they consider paying in btc versus fiat. This could work... but it could also piss of your customers. 
2) Social media campaign. Create image 'btc vs the fed' and share the shit out of it on twitter, facebook, reddit, ect. 
Just some ideas. I am stupid for all intents and purposes.

Well fuck... what other banks do they accept? 
@_date: 2013-06-23 20:24:33
How liquid is the market there? Thats my only caveat about leaving gox. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 02:49:54
I just did a quick look and I like what I see. Other companies out of the states charge like 50-80 USD for shipping on a one oz coin. I'm impressed. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:58:08
I'm in the same situation. I just cashed out on the 1000xpr to btc and I am left with 50 useless xpr. Whats the point of having "currency" thats to small to send? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:43:15
I wouldn't worry about the petrodollar collapsing any time soon. Last few countries who tried that kind of shenanigans got liberated... MURICA. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 03:19:15
Any user reviews? I want this to be legit sooooo bad. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 02:37:42
What? 
@_date: 2013-06-18 01:04:45
You accepted paypal as payment, should have used bitcoin, theres no charge backs. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:05:07
I'd consider it, so long as it was run by some publicly known and trustworthy people. If this was the case, count me in for 1 or 2 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 02:58:59
Please elaborate? First thing I'm doing in the morning is checking this out.
@_date: 2013-08-09 02:55:01
I love what these guys are doing. Great PR and outreach for bitcoin right here. 
@_date: 2013-08-10 21:56:50
Whats the premium you charge?
@_date: 2013-06-15 03:53:47
It could work if it has to do with online markets... people buy stuff on the internet and use fiat ALOT. There is some potential in there to spread the 'lords message' lol about btc. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 01:51:49
Hahaha okay. I was just covering all the bases. Whats your website and do you do work with custom wordpress sites? I might be in need of web design services this summer. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:43:47
Sounds awful, costs to much and there is hidden fees all over the place. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:33:03
Good for them. I wish bitcoin had this sort of traction in my area. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 23:50:30
Just downloaded it and I am impressed. All I need to do is get my circle of friends on board with it. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 03:30:59
Good to know. I am starting a ancap/agorist tech and current events blog soon and I am looking for ways to fund the site with out using google adsense. Anyone besides the OP use this site? Does it live up to the claims? 
@_date: 2013-07-21 02:42:45
Seems a tad ironic. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:14:08
OP's name rymes with the product... Mahysey is launching a service called Paysey. This smells of all sorts of types of weird. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:30:31
I'd be more then down to frequent your pizzeria if you were in my town. Go for it! 
@_date: 2013-06-14 05:40:10
Any plans to carry the pax ploom? 
@_date: 2013-08-25 03:36:25
Just go to Somalia instead. I hear there are no roads. ;)
@_date: 2013-06-04 01:23:00
1.Make a website displaying your work/skills
2.Post all over reddit/webdesign forums
3.Do some freebies
4. ?!?!?!?!
5. Profit. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 03:38:59
Anarchy, means to be with out rulers. Capitalism is the voluntary economic action between peoples and businesses. The two can work in synergy. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:55:29
No long term profit motive, shitty site, new and untrusted... SCAM! 
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:35:35
Does anyone sell bitcoin options yet? A straddle strategy would be awesome right now. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:04:28
My money is on a good old fashion pump and dump. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 17:22:27
"600 000 USD, meh we need more, i need to put that pool in my back yard... ugh i mean redesign that forum thing."
@_date: 2013-06-09 03:33:35
Dont let it be a bot. Make this be user controlled by an admin or something. If its a bot someone will abuse it or it will be considered spam. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:31:50
How good is the food? 
@_date: 2013-06-18 22:14:19
The title says 0% fees... 
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:28:24
This is exactly what I thought when I saw this on RT earlier today. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 19:06:47
Great idea. I'm surprised it hasn't been done yet. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 04:50:23
I don't even know what to think anymore. Im closing my eyes and going for the long term. There is to much manipulation and shallow market depth currently.
