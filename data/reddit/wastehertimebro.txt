Bitcoin is pretty much going the same path as gold. As of right now according to the gold chart. Bitcion will sky rocket in the next coming weeks or months but crash abit but maintain high value. They do say bitcoin is pretty digital gold.

There is always people making money. Just your method is no longer that effective. Adjust and adapt to these changes. Most people who made money was riding the wave. Now those who don’t know how to surf will just drown.

Quantum computers can decode and get your keys. This is also good news that any keys lost/untouched will be retrieved by quantum. Btw quantum computers are too expensive and unrealistic product for the public to use. We are technically at the building the motherboard and transistors stage if you wanna compare it to computers. 
Also people making videos that went viral about this.
