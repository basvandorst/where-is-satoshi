According to Soundcloud: Related Artists: Fetty Wap. This is so accurate I want to donate to the person that made that algo. They are both crap. +1

Your understanding of this is also not correct, sorry.

If they didn't have entrenched wealth on their side, they would be shitting themselves even more.

You seem like one of the cute ones. Let's be friends and musically untalented together.

Let's see 2020, but my fam except one would be like "oh, gee thanks Peter, another dozen Pokemon cards. You know how I love the Pokemon thing. Glad I spent $50 on nice towels for you."

You are dumb. If you buried treasure but forgot to write one of the numbers for the GPS coords, you'd be equally as screwed.

This is.. I mean it's like watching children try to talk about physics. If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it. 
"Mining means collecting Bitcoin." 
"Bitcoin means you don't need an accountant!" wtf seriously?

Oh not you. You sound like a bored 27 year old with a questionable self awareness regarding their lack of musical talent. Happy? :-) Oh I'm not that big of a cunt. j/k it's pitchy bro.

Ok I am not gonna explain how this is wrong on so many levels but I will point out the most obvious: trial and error? trying what? painting pictures? eating cake? Oh, computation you say? Then the rest of your comment reveals itself as ignorant.

I have a time machine. What?

I don't understand why all the music trending on SoundCloud sounds like teenagers figured out how to use a Casio keyboard's autoplay mode. Is that good music now? Bring back real rap and hip hop like Tupac, NWA, Dre, Snoop. /oldwomanrant
