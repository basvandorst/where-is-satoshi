Probably has much more to do with your bank than circle..
@_date: 2016-08-26 23:10:52
piss off
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:30:09
Ya sorry, just bored - sometimes circle does take a bit longer for me as well. I've had 3/4 days before, but all has come. I'd check with support in the morning too just to be sure all is well.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:25:54
You read my mind completely with this post
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:00:50
Posting to Reddit speeds it up too
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:51:26
Go to bed
@_date: 2016-08-05 05:32:07
This was so refreshing.
Thank you for reading my mind.
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:47:08
ill buy all your BTC @ 3100 CNY right now if you're concerned.
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:54:21
I'm in NJ. Would definitely pay a visit! 
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:22:22
Can confirm, he's helped me out as well with an electrum wallet! 
Went smoothly and only took him a couple days - was awesome to have those coins recovered ! :) Highly recommended

I actually used that one at MIT and another while I was in Boston not too long ago. Basically put in cash like a vending machine, and either scan a QR of your wallet for it to send to you, or choose to print a paper wallet from the machine.

LOL. smh

Upvote for reading my mind.
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:06:13
Hm, good question. I don't remember exactly, but there definitely was a little premium. Maybe a buck or two more?
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:16:32
LOL. good one.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:51:19
this please! :)
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:34:50
no, dao is a glorified scam. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:33:57
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:16:55
Perfect, thanks !
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:10:21
it is.

Can I pay using BTC on here?
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:08:21
Lol, this is unbelievable. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:38:22
Man, can these guys actually do something useful aside from blow hot air ? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:37:13
same thing, different method.
@_date: 2016-06-16 05:58:06
Odd, I was thinking something like this as well with all the tx comlpaint posts today.
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:41:56
lmao, also came here to say, man if I haven't heard that one before....
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:37:43
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:52:56
woot! ;D
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:53:51
You're the best !
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:06:07
@_date: 2016-05-18 20:17:39
why is this even posted here? so dumb.
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:47:29
aha, so on point with my perception of Andresen at this point.
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:04:49
right.. cause it's the network's fault for taking a long time to process a transaction that was sent using UNDER the recommended fee..
@_date: 2016-05-16 16:15:58
been here since 2011 dawg, there's no blinding here. you're clueless, sorry. time to stop the shilling.
@_date: 2016-05-03 11:02:25
@_date: 2016-05-17 01:01:29
dealing with this right now actually. ridiculous how low it is when a slight raise could cause such a convenience for customers. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:57:38
This is so beyond ignorantly incorrect...
@_date: 2016-07-23 01:00:51
Halp plox, reddit bitcoin !!1
@_date: 2016-05-18 20:18:49
They use the minimum fee/byte in transactions unfortunately. Starting to get annoying that companies like this can't bump up their fee a fraction of a cent for customer convenience. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:06:16
lmao. good riddance. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 00:10:29
I don't understand the need to run and post this to reddit before you've even gotten a response from them like someone here has the answer for you.
@_date: 2016-07-16 12:48:38
Right... because Pokemon Go is the first popular game that makes use of its own in game currency?.. Pokemon Go is suddenly going to wake up the world to BTC!!!
I feel like every time I come to this sub posts just get more and more idiotic. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:51:16
Nah, I simply dgaf to listen to people constantly whining on this forum
@_date: 2016-07-16 23:37:49
Use Electrum. You do not need to download the blockchain for that wallet. Here is a guide on how to move your wallet from QT to Electrum - 
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:06:44
Answ. is probably no to all of those considering he wrote residence instead of residents
@_date: 2016-07-22 19:22:40
So you go to bitcoin reddit for your answers?.. LOL
@_date: 2016-05-27 04:36:36
omg.. only clicked this to write exactly this. ./lolol
