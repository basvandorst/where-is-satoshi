The value of getting the network running seems higher then the values of the fees right now.  If LN can get running, it makes real throughput almost achievable.  Still think we need the other on chain updates, like schnorr.  But with that, we are close.

I hadn't thought of that.  I had been worried about the potential imbalance issue.  My understanding its okay, as long as the channel is open, but... if a channel is closed, it sounded like it could propagate additional channel closures if you didn't have enough funds to cover the original closure.
I assume this is like
n* -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; m* starts cheap, but if people keep sending through A -&gt; B, the fee starts going up because A and B are unhappy with the net imbalance, and if some of the m* get closed, A - B might close, then some of n* might get closed simply because the balance A owes B is greater then the initial channel size.
But that's cool that it can start advertising (eventually) Hey, Hey, n* &lt;- A &lt;- B &lt;- m*, ill GIVE you money, cause people keep sending money though me in the same direction, I want to go the other direction now.
I mean, there is nothing stopping implementations that will over-leverage their channels and require on chain to settle, but the one I want to run is one that is like, ehh, my channel is getting over leveraged in one direction, if you want to send though me in this direction, its gonna be expensive, cause now im at risk of needed to settle on chain later.

I think you still have to create the multisig contract, and broadcast it to the blockchain.  I don't think you have to fund both sides, but, it has to be broadcast, and I think added to the chain.  
But, that leaves you open to the attack where people could try to steal coins, you would have the justice contract, but you would be out the fee to broadcast it, where normally, you can use as much as all of the counter parties funds to ensure it gets on the blockchain, and its no cost to you.

I think sharding is an okay tech, I like the idea of running a medium level wallet that shards, and constantly audits parts of the block chain.

The other side of it is with the alt boom, right at the end of the year, in general pulling out for Fiat gives the option for people to invest in something to offset the taxes, say if they have a small business, and their tax year ends the 31st.  Based on the video card market, it does seem lots of people bought video cards for mining, the prices are way up again.  1070s are more expensive then 1070 TIs were 2-3 weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:30:26
I'm just saying re-balance to anything, not necessarily alts or mining, I'm also assuming this year has lots of short term investors who already have a tax liability.  Business investments provide some ability to offset taxes, and some small businesses use the 31st as end of the tax year.  Come April, from a personal standpoint, you can take 2018 profits, and use them to invest in an IRA for 2017, which would provide some offsetting.

I remember watching this a while ago, and it was one of the, ohh, I really need to re-evaluate what I know about Bitcoin.

I am less worried about SHA-256, and more worried about the model Bitcoin follows.  I will probably not hold much after 20 years because its a deflationary currency.  In 20 years not many coins will be produced anymore.  It might have a negative effect on volume since during deflation spending slows. 
While this might seem good for the price, it might wreak havoc in hashing power.  What will happen to the network, will people drop off, will people continue.  It will be interesting.

I do wish 2x had put some replay protection in, and did better signalling (Someone mentioned there is a HF bit).  And the reference code is already out.  I saw someone pushing a version that did replay protection and additional protections.  Maybe the narrative should be, if you wanna do 2x, please, use this code that has some protections.
The thing is if miners do split, its gonna be messy.  My main hope is when the dust settles, we don't do too much damage, and a there is a clear outcome.  I don't know the real timing of the LN, but LN is the real tech I care about, along with adding atomic cross chain swaps (where there are a few solutions for beyond LN).

That's not for like, 12 hours, and it may take the first block 20 min to hours to get mined, depending on hash.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:20:39
A group of users rejecting nodes would need hash rate to back it up.  The BCC hard fork contained code to help accomplish the fork with lower hash, fast difficulty lowering.  I don't think this exists right now for this fork discussion.  If it split 50 50, maybe both would have a chance, but I feel like a 25 75 would result in a branch dead.  It would take quite a commitment to keep the branch alive.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:53:39
Yeah, it's not really fair to judge yet.  Give it a few weeks when prices and hash rate have had a chance to align and normalize.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:53:19
I dunno, we need some type of instant transaction.  If we get instant transactions, and atomic chain cross swaps, we should have technology I think will allow high mercents adoption.  I think we will have so many transactions we will for sure need additional scaling changes.  I think blocksize will play a part (could be simple HF, or some SF solution, which I think there are proposals for).  But LN will in general possibly encourage more full nodes, so the nodes lost due to additional block size should be supplemented. We need all these solutions working together.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:49:03
I don't know how much cheaper it is compared to commercial rates (ignoring state to state differences).  Commercial rates you pay the power company to give it to you at 220 or 440 ish.  Industrial rates you are getting 14000 volts (varies) right off the power lines and it's your job to turn it into something useful.  There is efficency loss doing that, just you own the cost directly, not via the power company indirectly.

I'm still really excited about LN.  These points are somewhat valid, though I don't know how bad it is to open and close payment channels.  Yeah, peering might start as me having to ask to stake with people on forums manually, but I assume eventually it will be automatic.  You won't necessarily need to stake funds long, just publish you are willing to stake, then close the channel after the transaction is done.  The future is coming.

Changing the difficulty adjustment algorithm would need a HF (Based on my understanding).  With the original algo, it discourages minority forks from surviving. Edit: from surviving the initial fork until the next difficulty adjustment point.  I'm talking less about established coins.

I think there are some proof of collaboration style algorithms.  You would need something that is more PoS ish to assign a device an opportunity to mine a simple PoW algorithm.  I don't think it will come to bitcoin, but maybe to LN (or other L2/L3 service) to try and encourage more meshing.

"BTC network transfers are fast and free."
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:42:22
This fork is a bit different.  It will be difficult to split coins, not impossible.  BCH had code to make forking easier, and code to isolate the forks form each other (replay protection).  If you send coins on one fork this time, it's possible for someone (possibly automatic) to replay that transaction on the other fork.  Additionally, hash rate will be more important this time.  BCH had fast difficulty lowering, this made the lower hash BCH able to adjust quickly, and get back to 10 minute blocks.  BTC does not have this, and I think B2X does not as well.  If one chain gets 10% of the hash, block time will go to 100 min until the next difficulty adjustment window.  That's something like, over 60 days at that block rate.

@_date: 2018-10-16 04:45:14
Yeah, UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs).  Your balance is the sum of all UTXOs across all addresses.  UTXOs are from each transaction you are sent, and they are atomic, and are kinda like coins.  Each one has a value, and that value can not change.  You have to spend the whole UTXO, but, when you spend it, you can split it and send it to many addresses, the change address is how you can spend “part” of a UTXO.  You can also consolidate UTXOs, by sending, say, all your balance to yourself.
The cost to send, is not based on the amount of BTC you are sending (for on chain), it’s how many UTXOs you have to spend.  You could try and spend say 0.1 BTC, but it could cost 0.05 BTC if it was made up of thousands of UTXOs.  This is known as dust, sometimes the cost to spend dust is more then what the dust is worth.  Schnoor (sp) and other aggregate signatures methods could/will help this.

Even head replacement is hard, but you can DIY it.  You just have to buy the EXACT same head. Which can be hard, cause the same Model drive may have several part numbers.  You won't use a clean room, but you can run a hot shower (this will push dust out of the air), then open the drive.  The spinning of the drives on power up should help mitigate any dust on the plater via centrifugal forces.

Well, at 25% hash on Core, tx capacity would be about the same as pre Segwit.  40 minute blocks, but 4Mb blockweight.  Think market forces would be a big influencer.  At 5% hash, that's ~1/5th capacity.  Block times are now closer to 200 min.  If extanges differentiate BTC and B2X, now because there is limited capacity, extanges become localized.  Like, when you could trade BCH on extanges, but not withdrawal or deposit, prices varied from extanges to extange.  That's why, I tend to think one will win.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:18:28
You also would have had to not follow good investment strategies.  At some point, if your bitcoin investment is starting to take a significant % of all your investments, it becomes advisable to start diversifying.  You might not have sold it all, but there's probably only so much you would divest in alts, before needing to move some money to traditional investments.

It's an economical time to pump / speculate on Bitcoin Cash.  My understanding is the difficulty is expected to drop soon.  High price + lower difficulty.  Try to attract hash and hope the price sticks.  But lower block times if they do attract hash, mean in under 14 days, you will get a very hefty difficulty spike.
Edit: I forgot about the difficulty lowering in Bitcoin Cash, but its logarithmic or something.

It can be confusing at first, but most wallets run a change address.  If you look at the TX, there are 2 outputs.  In electrum, or other wallets, you can look at all the addresses it is generated, it should have generated some change address that has the remaining balance.

For now.  If you wait till Aug22 or beyond, SegWit will activate, and there will be more space for transactions, and fees should drop.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:41:05
I am curious what the plan is for communication failures.  It runs on these Hashed Time Locks, but what if a node in the network goes down in the middle of a transaction.  Is the intent that okay, nodes still there just reject that attempt, worst case you wait 1000 blocks to get the refund (or sonner if the node comes back and is like, okay, my bad, heres your coin back) and just try again?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:57:50
I wonder what will happen near the last 100 blocks before the adjustment, since BCH forces miners to wait 100 blocks before they can do anything with the reward.  Right now, they can get out fast, but there will be a slow period coming up.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:08:02
I thought the exchange was done via a 3rd party, someone who took the bitcoins, and paid for the pizza.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:44:44
My understanding is BCH has an adjustment for fast difficulty drop adjustment.  I assume that if this fork happens, this code won't exist.  I think one will quickly win, since it take 2016 blocks for the difficulty to adjust, at a 50% 50% miner split, it might take 28 days to adjust.  At 80% 20%, now the 20% might have to wait 70 days.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:34:30
Yep, we are in a middle ground, we aren't actually trading BCH yet, just exchange specific "BCH" coins.  Withdrawl and Deposits need to be enabled, and need actual decent block generation.

You can mine altcoins like ethereum (for now) or zcash using a graphics card, but you won't technically be able to exchange it I think if you wanted bitcoin.  But honestly, I don't think all altcoins are bad, some offer interesting new technologies.  Ethereum has smart contracts (which is interesting) or zcash which has zero proof transactions (theres another one that does this too) and sia which is like decentralized storage contracts.  I would read / skim the white papers, and yellow papers of some coins and decide if the technology is something you are interested in.  There are also tons of shitcoins.  Finding an actual gem to mine among all the new coins created can be difficult.
Edit: But its more economical to buy them I think.  Its a hobby.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:23:16

The only issue I have run into with the bitcoin-cli (or altcoins-cli) was the cli text limit.  But the decoderawtransaction usually provides ALL the details.  When parsing the live blockchain, I often fire gettransaction (name might be wrong) then fire the raw data back into decode.

Personally, I am waiting until an actual block or two is mined.  Why, if there are technical problems, will they fork at the current position, or move back up the chain.
By technical problems, I mean the fork takes so long people loose confidence, and miners stop trying, and they try to make BCH2 at a later date.  Highly unlikely.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:30:54
BCH provides transaction capacity using the technologies available today.  On-Chain scaling will probably cause problems in the long term, but they could probably go upto fairly large blocks, even 100 meg, and the network would still be functional.  100 meg would probably buy BCH a few years, maybe up to 10.  In the short term, its a viable technology. If BCH expects to stay viable in the long term (5-10+ years), they have to move off-chain.
How the forked was to me un-ethical.  Why do we need to fork chains, just start a new coin with the intended purpose.  This "Satoshis Vision" narrative annoys me, WHO CARES.  If hes alive, he seems uninterested in the debate.

If you are going to run remote services, never run them on a default port, use very strong passwords, requires encryption (win 10 supports it, does your phone app, is win 10 setup to allow unencrypted connections)
Remote services are never ideal for the machine running wallets.
Isolate hot wallet programs from each other and all other programs if you aren’t doing cold wallets.  VMs are cheap, the host machine could be conpromised, you would still possibly be screwed, but you can encrypt the VM, if it’s not running, it’s not accessible and limits exposure.  If the host machine is on, it is some of a barrier to access.  Run the VM in heavily firewalled mode.

And LN will be on both BTC and LTC.  If BTC and LTC are remain mostly compatible from a protocol and wallet standpoint, even without atomic swaps, its means after you finish your BTC LN integration into your app (hi square), LTC LN should be mostly free to integrate.  Hell, with enough LN work (some type of exchange rate determination, or easy way to see something like an order book), BTC LN users might not even have to know I am paying from LTC LN, and vise versa.  They don't care the exchange rate I pay, just as long as they get the BTC they want.

Every time you mine or RX funds, a token is added to the block chain.  If old enough, the signature of the token may have some uniqueness.  But if you only mined one block, you would only have one token, but its worth say 50 BTC.  You can't spend just half a token, you always have to spend a whole token, but, you can send it to multiple recipients.  This is what the change address is for, even if the change address is the same address, when you spend, the old token is destroyed, and 2 new tokens are created.

The issue is that only works as long as you hold. Once you try and spend, you are at risk.  That’s why you want to get them sent to different public addresses you control.  Come time to spend one, the transaction can’t be replayed if they are successfully split into 2 different addresses.  If you fail to split them, you can still send import the keys for one chain, to the other, and try again.

While it’s taxable, it sounds like there are 2 thoughts on what it’s cost basis should be.  One is that the cost basis was ~$266, that’s what Forbes says, one is that the cost basis is $0.  The IRS has not issued a formal guidance on this yet I think.
Edit: I really hope they say $0, because then as a holder, you have to track every alt that gets forked, what if that one dies in a year or two.

If you use the cost basis as 700, you also would owe the taxes on the 700, if you claim you obtained it when the fork occurred.

BCH has an interesting road ahead.  They are currently on the scaling solution of on-chain, but if they get adoption, they still need a few hard forks.

It’s gonna get weird.  People are lazy when it comes to upgrades as shown by,  says there are 50000+ nodes running Core &lt; .15.  So, BTC1 nodes will be connected to them potentially.  The question is, are the BTC1 nodes connected to each other.  Say BTC1 node A mines a Large Block.  It starts trying to relay it, but the paths get sketchy.  So the core &lt; 0.15 nodes don’t relay it (the .15 nodes aren’t even connected). If he has no direct connection to another BTC1 node, he is technically isolated, with no way to actually publish the 2X Block.  Then you have another BTC1 node B.  B mines a Small Block.  He could be isolated from BTC1 nodes, but it’s okay because his Block will still get relayed by the connections he has to Core &lt; 0.15.  You could end up with lots of temporary Forks that live in these isolated islands that can’t escape, but get overridden by a longer POW chain.  Now, it’s easily solvable if BTC1 nodes ensured they are connected to each other, so at least miners agree on the chain, and don’t orphan blocks.  But if you are a miner, and only mine small blocks, you increase you odds or simply orphaning off a competitors large block prior to the HF not becoming an orphaned block.

I am all for bigger block eventually, but 2x sounds like a plan for today.  What is the plan for tomorrow?  Your article seems to focus more on the political climate of bitcoin.
If we HF, it would be nice to see some future scaling built in.  I don't think pure schedule block size increases are right, but maybe a combination of that and user and miner consensus that they think we are ready for the next increase, so that now its a part of the protocol.  But an input to that equation is also how much we can scale off chain.  My point is, it would be nice if next time, humans were a little less involved.  I'm not saying that algorithm is easy though.

50 minutes isn’t terrible either, if segwit gets to 30% adoption, capacity is not too shabby compred to pre segwit.  After a couple months, difficulty would drop and then we would be at maybe 20 minutes (depending on how far we are into the calc period when the fork happens)

Yeah, you really are stuck trusting an exchange if you are looking to sell right away.  Once the split occurs, things will go to shit, and moving the coins will be hard on at least one chain, possibly both if miners are moving around.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:53:03
Isn’t this a closed ecosystem of trading?  You can’t withdraw these “split” versions of the coins right.
These prices are never very representative until deposits and withdrawals are possible.  It happened with Bitcoin Cash where extanges were at very different prices because they were all pseudo coins until they were actually moveable.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:07:03
Anywhere you spend coins digitally for goods or services would have records that could be linked to your identity at some point, unless it's some pure digital service with no physical delivery.  
But just withdrawing coins isn't a taxable event.

My understanding is no, because you might not have enough transactions in the mem pool.  If the 2X chain and 1X chain exist, without specific isolation protection (replay protection, hard addressed block, etc) the only protection is that 2X nodes have been banned / disconnected by the 1X nodes.  If the 1X POW chain is longer at any point, its technically compatible with the 2X chain.  Someone is welcome to correct me.  If the 1X chain doesn't die, its a threat to the 2X until protections are added (which would probably be another HF)

Sybil attacks on something like AWS or cloud services can be protected against to some extent.  Its simple enough to encourage nodes to try and connect to peers outside of a subnet they are currently connected to.  There are already scripts to disconnect nodes coming from AWS for 2 months until after the hard fork.  They aren't really needed though.
Outside of considering it an attack, BTC1 also needs to gather as many peers as possible before the fork, or they risk creating isolated BTC1 islands.  Its odd, miners don't want to relay directly to other miners, because its an advantage to not let them know the next block, but, if they can't find enough peers to relay blocks to, they will end up creating orphaned blocks if they are living in a island.  If the BTC1 network is not very strong and doesn't have a lot of peers to try, they will make orphaned blocks, and that will be.. interesting.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:33:44
There was just a big research article about it.   they spy on other pools just to get the block faster.  You want the network to accept your block is valid, but, hope it takes a while to propagate to other mining nodes.

It's done via consensuses, everyone who agrees to a certain set of rules can interact with each other.  Bitcoin is trustless, running a node of your choice allows you to validate what others are telling you, using the rule set you choose.  If another node sends you something you don't like, you disconnect from them.
As mentioned, anyone can change the rules, but, without consensus, you are left to only interact with yourself.  To change the rules, you need some level of acceptance from users and miners.  Some rules will fundamentally break things, and you will fork off from people you can't interact with anymore.
Bitcoin makes it difficult to do rule changes without significant support by default.  The network is negatively effected if the rule changes don't attract miners, since the difficulty (rate at which blocks are mine) are only recalculated every 2016 blocks.  This is 2 weeks normally.  If miners are not mining on the chain you are on, the block creation time will increase until a new calculation is done.  This can mean chains with little support could take months or years to calculate a new difficulty.
But, you don't have to follow that rule set.  Bitcoin Cash modified the rules for difficulty calculation, to allow them to create a new chain with significantly less hash power.  They had enough support and changed enough rules to allow them to split off.  Some of those rules changes have interesting effects to this day.
I have not specifically mentioned economic players yet.  When a split occurs, people may change their mind about which rule set they feal is the best, they may be driven by the value of the coin.  This may cause miners and users to switch between the chains.
What is bitcoin, well, its what you believe it is.  Not everyone may agree with you, and if no one agrees with you, well, you are welcome to tell yourself those 10 million coins you gave yourself belong to you, but no one else will believe you.

LN may add a lot of load to the blockchain.  I make... 0.5 transactions a year right now.  I want to participate, I don't expect anything in return, but if there are people like me, all trying to help build this network, lets see.
Lets pretend 12 tps with segwit.
What are lock times, 14 days be default (where did I hear that number)
Lets say 4 channels open, 2x a month.
So nodes we can support.
(8 on chain transaction per month)/30/24/60/60 tps per LN node
take 12/(tps per LN node) = 3,888,000 Nodes
Okay, thats decent head room for a while.

I'm less worried about a 51%, and just general manipulation / malice.

The narrative is that 2x only contains limited consensus between miners and corporations, and that many of these corporations fall under a single corporation. The deadlock today has forced the development of some amazing technologies, and methods for creating soft forks to improve scaling.  SegWit was one of the technologies born from the deadlock.  There a lot you can do with soft forks to create basically a layer 1.5, I have only recently start learning about the scripting engine that drives transactions, and the methods of soft forking op codes.
I try to lean more neutral, but my main position is 2x is a hardfork, which brings nothing to the table except a little bit of extra block size, and doesn't bring any ideas to the table from preventing the exact same debate again in 12 months.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:51:13
There might be a good number of orphaned blocks at the beginning too.  As a miner, do you want to work a chain that might be orphaned by 1x, or a different 2x while the fork is starting?

**Onchain transactions**
\-All addresses are known, and visible to everyone.
\-Transaction origin is known to nodes you are connected to and broadcast to
\--Full Node, you send your transaction to nodes you are connected to, they will know the IP your used to transmit with.
\--SVP wallet (like electrum), you send transaction to some server, it knows your IP, the server may or may not keep logs, you have no way to validate that, as its not trustless.
**Offchain (Ligntning) transactions**
\-The addresses used to fund channels are known, and visible to everyone
\-Intermediate transaction are not stored on the chain, only final, sum of all transactions are stored on the chain.
\-This means you only see when a channel is closed, unless you are in the transaction chain, you will have not knowledge that specific transaction, for example, your would not see if I bough coffee using LN, when looking at the blockchain.  You will simply see, the final totals of the channel between the 2 people involved in the channel, and non of the details of what got sent where.  There could be thousands of transactions off chain.
\-Inspecting the blockchain provides limited details, to find out more, you would have to contact the channel owners, and see if they have logs.
\-You send your transactions to a specific channel you have open.
\-The channel will know the IP that originated the transaction.
\-Additional links in the chain will know some information about the address, but not the IP in question.
\-It is possible the end points know the IP of each other, not 100&amp; sure.
So, is it private, not exactly, but, its better.  A sibyl attack could provide a state actor a decent amount of information, but they cant look at the actual blockchain and know full details.  It becomes opaque when looking at the blockchain.

How about a simple rule change that makes nodes prefer larger blocks in certain situations.
- Each node checks size of its mem pool
- When mem pool is large, delay block relaying if block is mostly empty
- Prefer to orphan smaller blocks
The goal is just add some risk to mining empty blocks, and cause it to increase the orphan rate of smaller ones.
This wouldn't really be a hard fork, I think the rules would still be compatible, but it is somewhat, non cooperative.  Kinda like QoS for blocks.  Problem is, miners could still make stupid large transactions with no purpose, and stuff them into their block.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:11:38

Yeah, when just scoped to just TPS, without other conditions, it’s huge.  Like, you could stream sub satoshi by the millisecond on a lyft or uber, or your electricity bill by the watt second.  That’s excessive, but it’s what you could do with an open channel.
When combined with overall amount, and funding sources, then you may saturate your channel unless you actually have functional bidirectional channels.

Wolfs hunt in packs.  They think they are hunting sheep, but they might be hunting donkeys.
By avoiding the Ban, they are actually being detrimental to their own goals.  If I was a miner or a pool, even if I ran a BTC1 node, I would never mine a large block.  A small block won’t get orphaned.  A large block might not successfully fork, and that might happen a few times.
Sometimes I think we should not ban the BTC1 nodes, we just don’t relay invalid blocks, but when we get a valid chain, we send it to them.  It’s not like they changed their side of the consensus rules.  If we send them a longer POW chain with all small blocks, they will take it.
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:45:01
Yeah, it seems like you are laying some trust on ACINQ, being one direction kinda negates that, the channel can only move in one direction, so they are protected, i think you are protected to, since its one direction.  This is my initial thought though, I might be confused.
That implies for a mobile wallet that is not regularly online, you would need to connect to a trusted node (IE one you run permanently).  You have to be there to broadcast your justice transaction if someone tries to cheat you, and there is a limited window to do this.
edit: That trusted node is essentially a trusted arbiter.  I feel like someone smarter then me could create a trustless arbiter.

It seems like they specifically start a chain of transactions and do one request at a time.  Each chain can only support 1 request every 10 minutes or so.  I'm assuming they have more then 1 chain active. They have some coins, then the send some coins to 1 customer, then I am guessing loop the rest of the coins back into their control and do it again for the next customer.  At least, this is what I see when I investigated the coins I got them.  It's odd, I can think of some reasons it might make sense.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:07:13
So, I'm looking at how it looks like coinbase sends BTC in the block explorer.  It's weird.  Its like, they send it to one person at a time, then loop a bunch of the money back into themselves then do it again.  I guess they don't like having too many open transactions at a time.  Not sure the purpose in looping the coins.  They must have more then one of these loops open at a time?  Thats like, 1 customer every 10-20 minutes, per active loop, depending on how fast that next transaction takes to get made and average block time.
