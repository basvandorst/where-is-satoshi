Interesting.  Are paywalls also considered extortion in NL?

Hey all, here are a some stats from when I ran botbouncer for almost 3 months on a website that was getting heavily scraped.  This particular site was getting 160K page requests from 2500 unique IP addresses per day on average.
* IP addresses banned: 49636
* Reasons for banishment:
    * rate limit exceeded: 628
    * bot-like user agent string: 11933
    * fake user agent string (ie. claimed to be googlebot): 3852
    * constantly switching user agent string: 1145
    * really old user agent version: 32078
* average time added to webserver response: 30ms
* total database file size: 240MB
* unban requests received via email: 1
* payment requests generated: 88303
* payments received: 0 :(
EDIT: hey stranger! thanks for the gold!
EDIT2: and other stranger! thanks for the tip!

Right, if you use this thing, you probably won't get paid right of the bat.
But botbouncer does send [some HTTP payment headers]( ie:
    X-Payment-Types-Accepted: Bitcoin
    X-Payment-Address-Bitcoin: 12A1MyfXbW6RhdRAZEqofac5jCQQjwEPBu
    X-Payment-Amount-Bitcoin: 0.05
    X-Payment-Amount-Unit-Bitcoin: BTC
I don't think there's any formalized protocol for 402 PAYMENT REQUIRED responses, so these were just made similar to what others had previously done.

Only one way to know... and that's to find out.  Go to the demo site and hit the refresh button **once**:
If it didn't like your 1st request, you'll get a payment request on the 2nd request.
But note!  Reloading the page 3 times within ten seconds will also get you banned (this is just for demo purposes, not default behavior).
@_date: 2016-04-29 21:19:41
By default, yes.  For instance, if you're using less than Internet Explorer 7, then you're considered a bot, but this is configurable.
It's crazy how many bots use an IE 6 user agent string, even though that browser has less than .5% of market share.  I guess it must be some kind of inside joke amongst scrapers.

Hi dev here.  Thanks for reporting.  Seems that the issue occurs when you've got a thread in your inbox, marked as unread, that you've already replied to.  Then it will autoreply to the last sender on the thread, which is yourself. I'll push out an update later today.


Can't reproduce this one, but feel free to PM me a screen shot.

Hi, Elephant Grass dev here.  Those permissions are required for the script to work.  It runs on Google's server, not a 3rd party server, and no data is "phoned home".
I'd suggest testing it first with a throwaway Gmail account, details on [that are here](
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:56:47
It uses Blockchain.info's receive API. They generate an address for you on demand, and forward any payments to your Bitcoin address.

This looks really cool.
Question: if I run a full bitcoin node like this on my LAN, and I send transactions from other devices on my LAN, what are the chances that my public IP address will be labeled as the originating/relayed by IP for those transactions by services like blockchain.info?
Also can this device be configured to be run over a openvpn connection?
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:36:32
I can't comment on the service, but this statement is definitely false:


    nslookup bitcoinpostage.info
    Address: 107.180.25.123
Quick lookup on that IP:
    Hostname: ip-107-180-25-123.ip.secureserver.net
    Network: AS26496 GoDaddy.com, LLC
    City: Scottsdale, Arizona, United States 
Even the domain is registered with godaddy.

Hey Jeff Berwick.  I'd be much more inclined to subscribe to your newsletter about the collapse of the dollar if you accepted Bitcoin.

No, they don't publish their TLD pricing, so they're not eligible.  Do they accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-15 23:37:12
For domains, I think the most reputable are: Namesilo, Namecheap, Gandi, Internet.bs, and Porkbun.
IMHO less reputable are Directnic, Dotology, Web4Africa.

How does CryptoWoo monitor for payments without running a full node(s)? Does it query an API?

Excellent. So for those wanting to setup a Bitcoin tip address on Gravatar:
1. Goto 
2. Click "Sign In" in the upper right hang corner, sign in on the next page
3. Click "My Profile" at the top
4. Click "Crypto-currencies" on the right hand sidebar
5. Enter your address(es), click "Save Currencies"
And then for those using Gravatar's API for your blog or whatever, you'll get the user's cryptocurrency addresses in the reponse, sample JSON snippet:
	"currency": [
		{
		  "type": "bitcoin",
		  "value": "1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
		}
	],

Please stop spreading FUD.  In the US, [the basic idea]( is:


This is a drone comparison website, and **drone owners** are being compensated to:
1. Write an authentic review of their drone, whether it be positive, negative, or meh.
2. The whole thing is [fully disclosed]( and any reviews that are compensated will have a note automatically added stating so.
3. All reviews are manually authenticated and require a dated photo of the owner's drone as proof of authenticity.

Hi, independent web dev here.  I've been considering starting an adult video marketplace/platform just as the OP describes.  Take a look at some of the competition:
* [clips4sale.com]( - laughably poor website, performance can be extremely slow, at least 5 clicks before you can view any video preview, but they get a ton of traffic
* [videoclips.com]( - slightly better, but requires a login to make a purchase
* [extralunchmoney.com]( - better UI, same deal, requires a login to make a purchase
None of these sites accept cryptocurrency, they accept credit cards through ccbill.  And most take a 30% to 40% cut of the content creators sales, with minimum earnings for payouts anywhere from $50 to $100, made on a monthly or weekly basis.  
By accepting and paying out in cryptocurrency, you could take a smaller cut, no minimum earnings for payouts, and payout immediately. So content creators make more money faster.
I can make a platform like this, but I'd need a trustworthy CFO/COO with some adult website experience to handle the legal and promotional aspects. And most importantly, acquiring content creators to sell their goods on the site.
If you're interested in being that CFO/COO, contact me at info [PGP here](  Provide some of your past work, achievements, or resume.  Here's my [portfolio]( my biggest achievement to date would probably be doing the original frontend work on [Kraken](  I also worked for ccbill back in the day.  Let's do this.

The "Best Value" column is the registrar that offers the most value for your money when you own that domain with them.  It's basically a ratio automatically calculated like this:
**value of free features / average overall pricing over the course of 3 years**
So Namecheap offers .pw registration for $3.98, renewal for $8.88, and that includes WHOIS privacy for 1 year only.  Internet.bs offers .pw registration for $7.99, renewal for $7.99, and you get WHOIS privacy every year for free.  Over the course of 3 years, Internet.bs is a better value (price comparison [here](
I've got more details and the formula used to determine value scoring on the [FAQ](

Hi there.  TLD List is my side project, and I recently added this listing of domains that can be purchased with Bitcoin.
It features 3 major registrars that accept Bitcoin: Namecheap, Namesilo, and Internet.bs.  If you know of other reputable registrars that accept Bitcoin, and transparently publish all their prices, please let me know, and I'll work on adding them to the site. Thanks!

So the full content is only protected by a javascript overlay?  What's to stop a user from deleting the overlay elements:
    &lt;div id="bitmonet-grayOut" &gt;
    &lt;div id="bitmonet-dialog" &gt;
and then just consuming the content for free?

This is cool, and is similar to an idea I had for a new reddit-esque, social, sharing website:
* users that submit popular posts and content are rewarded with Bitcoin.
* The amount of the rewards would be based on metrics like how many upvotes/traffic/responses/etc the post had received.  The more popular the submitted content, the bigger the reward for the user.
* The source of the Bitcoin rewards are derived from a few different sources, but the major one would be from the revenue that the site generated from displaying ads.  The site would transparently publish how much it was making from ads, and designate say 50% of it to be handed out as rewards to users for their content contributions
Obviously the big issue would be detecting and preventing scamming it (ie. bogus upvotes/traffic for crappy content).  This would not be easy.  
A site like this might also attract a different type of user: one who may be more incentivised to post good content solely for profit, as opposed to just doing it to share cool stuff/ideas for the common good.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is subjective: reddit karma is worth whatever you think it's worth. Bitcoin has some actual worth.

This sucks and it's inevitable.  We should expect to see more services that build profiles of Bitcoin users popping up in the near future.  It's going to be an emerging market with customers from law enforcement, governments, regulators, and other bitcoin users.
alex_waters may claim it's opt-in, but I'd bet my bottom BTC that they'll be scraping bitcointalk, reddit.comblogs, and other websites for bitcoin addresses and related identifying information, with the end goal of creating a database that maps **bitcoin addresses ---&gt; real people**.
I also shudder to think if other services (like exchanges, wallets, etc) could be coerced into selling their data to governments or companies like Bitcoin Validation.  It may not be realistic, but imagine if blockchain.info offered up their server logs to the highest bidder?
Best thing to do is be careful about which bitcoin addresses you publish that can be linked to your identity.  If you happen to publish an address, use a tumbler.
I'm sure the NSA has a cyptocurrency profile building system in place already.  Hey alex_waters, why don't you ask them to open source their codebase for you?

How did the SEC get all of these figures?  
* Did pirateat40 use the same bitcoin address for all investor deposits?
* Or were all his deposit addresses publicly listed on bitcointalk?
* Or did the screwed investors report the deposit addresses they used to the SEC?
* Or did the SEC simply subponea all the major bitcoin exchanges for all their transaction records on Shaver?
