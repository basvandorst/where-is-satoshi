thank you, yes, they are pretty gender specific

Thank you! I had to explain it to her at first (i'm a nerd at heart) but she let me talk her into it. I hope you find something she will like!

if anyone wants to buy something, I made a coupon code "reddit" for free shipping =-)
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:47:21
i would go for it, you never know
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:15:24
sweet! i didn't really think people would buy them on here, but I'm loving the warm reception. Hopefully it validates my "you should accept internet money" suggestion to her, haha
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:14:08
haha, I wish y'all could see them in person. she's an architect, so she's got incredible attention to detail. I tried to encompass that in the photos and website

In doing so, you will help solidify my "Husband of the Year" title :-)

Do you mean you've thought of accepting bitcoin? Do you already sell online?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:53:40
Are there any products you don't see that you'd like? I'll give her all your feedback, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:38:05
Thank you for the suggestions. I made the website and I'm always open to feedback. 
The hard part of changing this is that the patterns aren't similar enough to categorize, so we'd have to list every single pattern as options, many of which are very different from the "demo" product. 
What about categorizing items by color or theme (geometric, chevrons, abstract, etc)?

Which one were you looking at that was out of stock?
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:01:56
I build websites, so I made my wife's for her. But if you're doing it in your own I would try shopify, and they have a free trial. 
Once you list your items on your shopify page, you can create an acct with BitPay and they integrate with Shopify's cart.

also congrats on being on reddit AND having a gf
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:07:49
holy crap! that's awesome! My wife will be so happy, you are her first BTC customer!!

Not sure if it's a compliment. Have an upvote anyway!
