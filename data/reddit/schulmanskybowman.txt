yes. 
at the left corner of the trezor wallet it shows two options 
accounts and legacy accounts . 
accounts run segwit 
legacy accounts do not.
i sent coin from my normal electrum wallet to an address under ''accounts'' which run segwit i should have sent them to an address under ''legacy account'' which runs original bitcoin core. 
Segwit wallets do not currently have public keys so when i tried to get my public key and could not, that's when i discovered that i had set up a segwit wallet instead

You know, it was actually Giannis , Blake griffin, Lebron, KD , harden and Westbrook all to score 20 or more . I couldn’t believe my eyes lol , they all do this in their sleep literally every single game . I was worried about Blake griffin if anything because of the Kardashian curse but they all pulled through lol. I would check the box scores at work every few minutes , calculating with glee , down to calculating how much I would have after coinbase and transfer fees ������ . You live and you learn

i sent my btc to my new trezor account then i tried to get a watch only address by looking for my xpub. when i tried to it didnt show an xpub, i checked online and it said there were no xpubs for new accounts only ''legacy accounts'' . Theres a tiny information button beside accounts that takes me to a trezor page explaining what segwit is .
