Not sure if this is a joke, but something like this could really help my family so I'm going to try anyway.

It's true that bitcoin needs to be adopted everywhere before it can realize it's full potential, but it certainly has value.
If the government makes it illegal, you don't suddenly lose your money. You just can't use it there legally. But you still own it and they cannot take that away. Consider how your life would be if you lived in a totalitarian dictatorship where the corrupt officials can walk into your bank and take away everything you own. It happens all the damn time. My parents lost their entire livelihood when the Viet Cong took over Vietnam. All their middle class assets were seized and they had to escape to America with nothing and start over. Even in non-dictatorships this can happen (e.g. Cyprus). Imagine if they had bitcoin, they could have taken all their money with them without carrying a single thing but a piece of paper and a bunch of numbers.
Bitcoin is here to solve a lot of problems in the current money system. Just because we've learned to live with its problems doesn't mean that there is nothing better out there.
Besides, I'm no expert, but I think bitcoin has or will get so big that any country that tries to hinder it's growth/adoption by making it illegal will only find themselves left behind.

Sorry if I'm completely misinformed, but is bitcoin outlawed in Vietnam?

right, thanks for the correction!

A standard CPU is designed to be able to do just about anything you want to do on a computer. Bitcoin mining is a process which requires a lot of mathematical computation. Though standard CPUs can complete the task, it may not be as fast as a chip designed for fast repeatable mathematical computation. This is why GPUs are popular for mining right now.
An ASIC or (application specific integrated unit) is a specific device designed on a circuit level that can pretty much only complete a specific type of calculation, but do it extremely quickly. And in this case, they're designed to ONLY mine bitcoins. 
You wouldn't be able to use your ASIC miner to surf the internet, for example. So you can think of a CPU as a "jack of all trades" and a "master of none".
Someone with knowledge of computer engineering should be able to create an ASIC miner, but I doubt it's easy for any commoner without any prior knowledge.

If you just want to buy a few bitcoins to play around with, you don't need to be verified with MT.Gox to load some funds into your account. Just make an account, then follow the instructions on how to add funds. If you're in the US, you can make a bank transfer which will take 1-3 days.

I don't think he has a basis, but nobody should. Just look at the internet, that is the world's greatest experiment right now! People are constantly finding new ways to use it. And so too, people will find new ways to use bitcoin.

The first time you get a tip or contact the bot, it creates a wallet for you. If you already have one, it just continues to use that wallet.

Well before you make any purchase, you should learn more about cryptography and why bitcoin works. If you believe that it is undervalued, buy some bitcoin. If you don't think it has potential, don't buy it. Simple as that.

What does having computers with radeon cards have to do with purchasing bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:09:01
The short answer is no. The whole thing is designed open source which, layman terms, means its publicly available online and there are no hidden features built into the code we don't know about. Bitcoin is built upon cryptography. Theoretically bitcoins CAN be hacked, but not with any existing technology and resources.
