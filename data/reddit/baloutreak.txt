In response to your last sentence, i'm really not worried thanks to the open source nature of bitcoin which allows anyone to create a currency, people will always have the choice to opt out of a system that is imposed on them,even if government were to completely ban cash people would exchange anon coins between each other.

Well, yeah you could even have the bank register a billion addresses to your name but you actually use completely different addresses. see my point?  Public key registration is completely useless unless the bank has its own blockchain or has taken over bitcoin and changed its rules. ( only transactions with registered public addresses are processed by the network)

I agree with you but article talks about the relation between ID and currency, talking about KYC, also saying there is a critical need in digital currency for user ID to be verified.
This to me doesn't sound like a simple ID record on a ledger.
Banks replacing government is very concerning, that's what brough our economy to its knees.

"a trusted authority that seeks to associate the public key with the identity of a certain individual or business entity "
Another article that proves banks do not understand this technology, people can own and create millions of different public key if they want . 
Or maybe they intend to create their own coins which nobody will use , not clear what " digital curencies " means in this article, anyhow this sounds like another idiotic plan.
