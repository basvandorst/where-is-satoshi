One day of research? Eh I guess. I read weekly buys are better so I’ve been doing $100 weekly buys and now am doing $200 but think $500. Shits wild.

Naw I make pretty good money. The most I could buy is like $500. If I would have bought at $2k that would be like $1500? I make way more than $500 a month lol. I also like my job. I don’t consider it a waste of life.

I have been doing reading. Even after reading up on it I still didn’t trust giving my money to an “exchange”. Then I asked my friend about it and he basically said “it’s ok to work with exchanges. That’s how it works.” He recommended Coinbase. 
I became interested in bitcoin at $2k but wasn’t going to invest without researching. I put in the effort and still was on the fence about giving my money to an exchange. Once my friend said that’s how most people do it I then understood it was ok. I guess if that’s holding my hand through it so be it. We’ll have to agree to disagree.

Dude! I have been trying to buy since around $2k but have been so busy with work. Kept putting it off. Finally had time to do some research over Thanksgiving. Still didn’t get it completely. Still trying to figure out the hardware/ multiple wallets. 
Anyways still haven’t bought any because I don’t trust just giving my money to something called an exchange... finally I give up and ask my friend who is doing it. He says just buy some on the Coinbase App. I’m like alright, whatever. So bought $100 worth of bitcoin. Also bought some Ether and Litecoin just cause. Now I feel better. I’ve scratched my itch. 
Now that I’ve got that out of the way I can grasp some of these posts with more context. Learning from this dude is very helpful.

Eh if I’m going to invest money in something I need to research it. In order to research it I need to make time for it. I just decided I would look into it over Thanksgiving and did. Sure my $100 would be more if I did it when it was $2k but I’m not crying over $200. The thing is even if I knew bitcoin was going to triple in 2 months I would have only been able to invest maybe $500. I have bills ya know!?

Interesting. Will look into once Coinbase confirms purchase. Thanks.

Idk. It seems like that’s kind of how this guy started out. I assume you’re supposed to buy on Coinbase or other exchanges then transfer to a physical wallet.

Ah cool. Thanks man.

What’s blockchain? Lol. And how do you do that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:21:29
Just on Coinbase now. I think you’re supposed to get some kind of hardware wallet. I think using your phone as a wallet works
