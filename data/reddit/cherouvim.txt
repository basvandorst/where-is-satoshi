His face doesn't look tired. He doesn't look like he hasn't slept for the last 5 days. Isn't he freaked out?

I hope the gift is 1 BTC.

Don't worry. At some point in the future 1 bit = £1.

This photo makes me dizzy. I also kick myself when I remember reading about bitcoin in the very early days in slashdot, and not doing anything about it. I was probably too busy doing something totally unimportant.

Took me 10 seconds to understand how the middle image was 3d rotating while I was scrolling down the gallery at imgur.

Proof of this?

I've got a couple of friends who mined lots of BTCs but ended up selling them for virtual weapons on some games very early on. They are very sad right now.

I placed some items in my basket, I went to checkout, but couldn't find the bitcoin option. Where is it?

btcgreece.com and bitcoinsgreece.com have eurobank accounts where you can push euros and buy bitcoins. Problem is that they now charge 10 euros per transfer (500 and 250 max per day each).

I do now.


Super cool. 20% at starbucks sounds great for regular users.


Can't use the product since I'm from Greece, but in your  page I think you should increase the contrast between yellow and white (especially on footer) since it'll not be easilly visible by the 100% of the population.


Don't mess up like some other bitcoin startups did in the past. And maybe on the site present media logos of sites/papers etc where you've appeared.

Thanks for the explanations. What do you suggest should I do? End up with a wallet full of addresses? (I use blockchain.info/wallet)
I thought of this plan so when I print my wallet it just has a single pair of QRs and not tons of them.
