100% correct but massively ironic as well - reread the bitcoin whitepaper and search for the word trust - 14 occurrences.
And the first line of the conclusion - We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.

So lets say mark karpeles has been running a massive fraud and is about to disappear with everyones bitcoins.  Should he be free from prosecution as his business was running a bitcoin exchange and therefore shouldn't be regulated because then you'd be regulating bitcoins?

Nailed it
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:28:55
No thats just not true, can you come up with any reasons or examples why regulating exchanges like gox regulates the currency itself?  Secondly, depends on the meaning you are applying to these words, unfortunately they have more than one so its clouding the issue.
In my mind the point of bitcoin and the reason it shouldn't be regulated is to avoid the situation where a central bank can carry out quantitave easing and devalue the real world wealth of normal people.  So when I say bitcoin should be unregulated I mean there shouldn't be a group of people able to do this.
And more importantly regulating a market to prevent something like gox happening again is not regulating bitcoin itself.  They are two different things.

I'll kick off, I think to achieve the original goals of a decentralised currency, more than one currency is needed.
I'd love to see the point where it doesn't even matter what the name of the coin you hold is.  As a merchant I want a mechanism of accepting any liquid, tradable currency that at the point of sale is converted into a currency that I need.  I don't want to even now if it was originally bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin, dogecoin or even maxcoin (although preferably not maxcoin)

We have a decent way of dealing with this - have a miner, however small, at the location.  Amazing how quickly transactions appear on the network.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:25:40
It seems to but I've got a few concerns/questions about it I'm trying to work out.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:38:09
Just out of interest what gave you that idea? Bitcoin was created to provide a currency that doesn't rely on trust. The word regulation doesn't even appear in the white paper.
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:25:22
What?  You do understand i have to trust my staff with cash right?  Seriously.  They are able to hide notes in their pocket if they want.  I can't even get my head around where you are coming from.
At the end of the shift they have to account for all payments received, and I spot check stock to ensure all sales go through the till.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:21:15
In all seriousness why can't you have both, they aren't related.  One aspect is the whether a central body can change the currency, and the other is whether a market containing that currency can be regulated.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:26:00
But without regulation in a market you can't define what is and isn't fraud.
Easy way to look at it is this. One regulation of bitcoin exchanges requiring them to hold customers bitcoins in ringfenced accounts that are independently audited would have prevented (presumably) this entire fuck up with gox.
Nothing there has anything to do with regulating how bitcoin operates, it is purely regulating the market around bitcoin.

Hi Dave thanks for visiting! Like I said we've got a cryptocurrency meetup at the end of the month that I'll post here and in the Oxford sub.
Have you got a link to the bartender's app you mentioned?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:31:08
Well the important thing is bitcoin and the market are separate entities. People saying that gox should enable insider trading because bitcoin shouldn't have a central controlling body are treating them as the same thing.
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:06:55
OK you're an idiot and here's why.  My staff take payments IN CASH.  That is ridiculously insecure, and untraceable.  On the other hand what I did today is completely auditable.
In addition, because I'm an adult and I employ and work with adults I'm 100% comfortable with trusting my staff with stuff like this.
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:59:33
Its a shame to see, bitcoin is trying to be taken seriously and this is a senior core developer.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:49:19
I don't think it is. I think the original core goal of bitcoin was to provide a currency/store of value that you could hold yourself and didn't rely on a central organisation that could manipulate it's value at will.
Is this incompatible with regulations controlling exchanges and markets?
Personally I think the whole gox clusterfuck suggests there needs to be regulations in place. Nothing that can affect the protocol itself, but definitely something to protect people who choose to use it.

Yes, don't worry that they have a way of compromising every Windows PC!  They haven't done it to this specific PC yet!  They can do it whenever they want, but they haven't yet, so everything is fine!  Move along now, nothing to see...

Also, you really need to stop being so fucking patronising given you are sitting at your computer that is god knows how impossible to comprehend to someone from 50 years telling a complete stranger on the other side of the atlantic ocean in virtual realtime (which would have been scifi mere decades ago) that you know how technology will look in 100 years.

Try thinking "bitcoin stagnation removed" and it starts making more sense (for me).
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:49:45
The networking power of bitcoin has doubled 8 times this year.
Are you seriously saying in 100 years time you think SHA256 is going to be sufficient protection for an address?  Cause if not the only way to sensibly work with this is a migration to increasingly well protected coins.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:41:59
My bad, not enough coffee and I've just finished a course on aes, I meant to put sha both times! Basically my point is still valid, the mining network itself is growing at a rate where it's going to be able to brute force wallets relatively soon. And by relatively I mean soon enough to be a problem. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:47:39
Well the only question that really needs answering is what nationality will the bank be and what legal implications will that have regarding security of deposits? 
@_date: 2013-05-23 00:53:27
Sure, but you may still be missing my main point.  
Whether or not a currency can function in increasing welfare is a moot point if its not paired with an economy.  Worries like that only exist in a position where you have a floated currency paired with an economy.  Without that link it just doesn't matter.  Without that link your example doesn't even exist.

Probably too late to get a reply but here goes anyway - 
Why altcoins are essential, inevitable and good for the cryptocurrency ecosystem
1.  Blockchain stagnation
People who use cryptocoins will always lose them/make mistakes with wallet keys/die without leaving instructions.  This will happen a lot less to the large holders of bitcoins who so far seem to be mostly sitting on them and a lot more to the people who actively use them, and small holders.  
We want cryptocoins to be something that will last, and given this trend we will need altcoins to provide new and less stagnant blockchains.  Your idea that divisibility will solve this problem is great, until you look at what will happen to the ratio of active to inactive blockchain and try and picture what would happen in 100 years time when one of the earliest 'whale wallets' wakes up.  By having new altcoins in use the exchange rate mechanism will create a buffer. (Although it will still be fun to watch)
2. Technology (i hate reddit formatting sometimes)
Cryptocoins have to evolve constantly.  Bitcoin has inertia to change that new currencies don't.  I haven't had enough coffee to come up with subtle issues so I'll go straight to the worst case scenario.  What happens when computing power is capable of breaking the public/private key?  At some point in time it will happen. 
I know what the problem with this is, AES takes 1 billion, billion years to hack and all that.  As long as no issues with the algorithm are found.  But that means computing power has to double around 59 times before it can be done within 2 year, something it has been doing every year and a half so far.  Kind of makes it seem like the keys will be crackable before bitcoins stop being produces.
And don't forget about the whole mining hash power issue.  That doubled in 3 weeks, and its all designed to be able to break aes256 isn't it?  How long before the miners themselves have enough power to just start breaking open wallets?
Of course, this problem is easy to avoid, just change the strength of the encryption used.  But how are you supposed to get an entire blockchain to update their keys?  This puts a date on the life of any one cryptocoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:15:58
Just did some quick maths and I think the network power needs to double something like 160 times for be able to go through every option for addresses, breaking each one, in a year.
Which is missing the point a bit - at some point the security used for the address public/private key will need to be upgraded.
To do this to an existing blockchain is a colossal pain in the ass, and would still leave a massive problem - each wallet owner would need to do it themselves which would leave a lot of addresses unupgraded.  What do you do with these?  It makes so much more sense for people to just move to a new coin with better security.
That's what I'm trying to get at - Erik's attitude of bitcoin being the one and only, true coin, basket to put all of your eggs in, is bullshit.  Cryptocoins have an amazing future, bitcoin itself not so much.
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:56:51
Your point applies to currencies linked to an economy, eg the US dollar and the US economy.  The problem with deflation is it has a negative effect on the US economy, which has a real life effect on real people.
There is no economy linked to the bitcoin currency, (except for the very few places that only take bitcoins eg silkroad) so really there is no noticeable problem caused by bitcoin deflation.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:47:07
For illustration only, as it's impossible to do any more as we'd be talking about technology that hasn't even been invented yet. But I've already done "a course or three" in maths, so care to enlighten me? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:01:26
So the Landauer limit is a classic case of something theoretically making something impossible when in fact its irrelevant.  
Are you saying this hypothetical computer is impossible because it requires too much power, or because it generates too much power?  Cause one thing kinds of solves the other.
Physicists quote Landeuer's limit as proof that moore's law can't keep scaling.  Engineers quote it as proof that computers in 100 years time will need plugging into steam turbines (I know, it won't be a steam turbine)
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:58:27
Thanks, got it! 
Would coming up with a breakdown of where all the bitcoins are at one point in time and using this instead of all the historical transactions help enough, or is the problem more to do with fragmentation of the currency into too many different wallets? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:14:55
No you haven't made your point partly because I'm far too stubborn... 
But before I do a proper response two quick questions... 
Do you think the address protection will ever need improving? 
Do you understand my point about moving to a new coin making more sense than patching a broken one? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:40:44
Seriously, I know what exponential functions are.  Try running the numbers for current network hash rate and how many times it would need to double, hypothetically, before you could run every option for private keys within a year is and let me know the answer.  I'll admit though when I checked the energy limits it was only going to require something like 30gw for a year so I'll have to check the source on that.
But bottom line is any change to the algorithms for mining is fine.  Changes to the algorithms for addresses will mean it makes no sense staying with bitcoin.  Try and think through the process of every address holder having to upgrade, and then knowing that there are a loads of addresses that weren't upgraded that are now vulnerable.  Sticking with a blockchain once you know that addresses, even if they are version 1.0 addresses, are capable of being compromised makes zero sense. A constant gradual migration to better protected coins is the way to go, as each one will leave an exchange rate mechanism to buffer any problems with older coins.
