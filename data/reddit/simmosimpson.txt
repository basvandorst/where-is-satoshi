Whaaat? How so? You can’t see it?

Because the media are sheep, no one should ever use the general media as a resource when gathering info regarding cryptocurrencies.

Are you actually comparing litecoin to penny stocks!!??

Says the guy trying to encourage people to sell their cryptocurrencies in order to pick up cheaper coins himself in the most blatantly obvious way possible.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:22:57
Yes, &amp; lots of it!
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:00:56
And we also found the pessimist!! 
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:50:00
Wow that joke really did fly straight over didn't it!? Not even a "Dickhead" would own 1 BTC without knowing the estimated current value. Relax kid, not everyone is out to nick your shillings.

Two months?

Some might say "A real hoot"

Because I imagine by the time it takes the average person to save 4k, bitcoin will be 8k

A figure of speech. A shilling is an old coin from the U.k. I was implying that not everyone is out to steal your money. I made a joke that most would of at least acknowledged it was a joke &amp; not took it serious. Obviously I didn't know I was aiming it at simple Jack from the hood. My bad! Ya get me!?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:50:45
Me too buddy! $1m bitcoin within 10 years I think. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:51:07
The current value is already priced in to China's shenanigans so maybe a slight dip if China pulls the plug but don't expect a massive dip like before. If it all turns out to be bullshit as some have mentioned then I imagine the price could easily go back up to the $5k mark.

Don't borrow, steal!

Not seen this one, I love it!! 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:52:59
I think that is trust on banks in you that make you feel this way. There will never be more than 21m bitcoin so consider yourself lucky that you own 1
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:21:52
Keeping them in cold storage then I am guessing I would have the bitcoin on both blockchains still? I have no intention of keeping the worthless coin &amp; would sell it in the event of the split &amp; use the fiat to buy more bitcoin. I'm just wondering how I would go about this if it forks whilst having my bitcoin on my ledger
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:24:28
Easiest way but not the cheapest is: Sign up to coinbase &amp; verify all the details required (address, bank account, I.D, etc) &amp; you can purchase bitcoin, ether &amp; litecoin from there. If you do decide to invest in bitcoin make sure you are as well educated as possible in terms of how to store your bitcoins &amp; cryptocurrencies safely. This is like rule No.1 of cryptocurrency investing.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:31:06
price is about $100 per bitcoin but il buy it off you for a generous $200?
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:28:40
Hahaha �� My bad! Clearly I didn't know hoot I was talking to! Owl be more careful next time bro! ��
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:50:20
Well said, bitcoin has already been cheap &amp; whoever missed out, too bad!
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:19:21
I had to learn this the hard way. Tried trading last couple of days, failed. managed to recover my losses during this crazy alt dip tho so now I'm staying away from the exchanges. My asshole has never twitched so much in it's life!!!
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:23:03
3 or 4 years
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:20:14
Ah I see. I'm guessing in the event of a fork an update for the cold storage devices will be soon after in order in to receive B2X??
