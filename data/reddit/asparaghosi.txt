getting real incomes up? getting more of the populace to invest in capital assets?
These sound like great "tweaks." How do they work?

Poloniex is also the exchange that made an overnight policy change that Legacy accounts would have to comply with KYC despite stating specifically in the months leading up to it that that would not be the case. Garbage exchange run by garbage people.

 What OP is saying is that these ETFs, if not required to have BTC backing it, will be able to expand "supply" to suit their needs. This will drive down the price.  
Why? Because parties otherwise interested in buying Bitcoin will essentially be able to "buy" BTC, that isn't actually BTC. It takes their money and decouples it from having any impact on the market price. The precious metals sector is very heavily manipulated via this and other means to maintain price movement within certain ranges.   
tl;dr Unbacked BTC ETFs are not a use case, they're essentially a "negative" use case as they replace something BTC would otherwise do.
