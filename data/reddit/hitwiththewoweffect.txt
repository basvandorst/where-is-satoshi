I want banks to stop fucking with it every other week. Yes. You can be anarchy guy, over throw govts guy. That's not how this will go, sorry. This is the real world where the elites dictate the markets regardless. Please learn.
I understand this however im running out of patience with obvious manipulation and seeing time after time what causes a sea of red. It's fucking annoying. No one has will power to say no fuck you back and buy the dip.
People sit and wait to trade depending on the news. They believe in crypto but want to save a few dollars. Pretty soon everyone is doing that and you get this.
...in the absence of will power, the most complete collection of virtues and talents is wholly worthless.

Most "crypto personalities" or crypto institutions don't give a flying fuck about the actual assets. They only want as many USD as they can get. Or charge the highest amounts of fees and still having people use them. (Excluding Binance). Whales? No they don't pay feees. Bleed the middle class. Bleed the poor. Bleed everyone for fees. All these blow hards are confidence people. Pumping up shit like its about to happen tomorrow. Funny thing is, NO ONE HOLDS THEM ACCOUNTABLE. You think people like George Soros give a flying fuck about the actual concept of what bitcoin is? No. He sees a quick billion he can make and move on to the next venture start ups that fail over and over again. None of these people have real passion for the actual assets. Soros is probably the one dumping hard at midnight. Laughing while doing it. Then in a couple weeks China will legalize crypto and everything back green. THESE PEOPLE KNOW THE INSIDE INFORMATION. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHEN TO BUY WHEN TO SELL TO GET OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE FUD HITS. IT'S A GAME. WE ARE ALL BEING PLAYED. YOU DON'T THINK THE BITIFINEX STORY WAS PLANNED ON FRIDAY??? OR THE JAPAN AML REGULATION FUD? ITS A JOKE! IF YOU CAN'T SEE THIS, YOU ARE BLIND OR JUST NAIVE.
LET'S GO BACK TO WHEN FACEBOOK 1ST BANS CRYPTO ADS, GOOGLE BANS CRYPTO ADS, TWITTER BANS CRYPTO ADS, SNAPCHAT BANS CRYPTO ADS. ONE. AT. A. TIME. DROPPING THE MARKETS 10&amp; FOR EACH ONE DOING IT. LIKE A GANGBANG BUKAKI. MEANWHILE EVERY MILLENIAL RETARD THAT DOES ZERO INVESTING RESEARCH CAN BUY FACEBOOK, APPLE, NETFLIX OR GOOGLE CALLS AND MAKE BETTER GAINS. WHILE SOME OF US SPEND HOURS READING WHITE PAPERS, UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS, REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS WE CAN SEE, GET SHIT. WE GET TO JUMP INTO TETHER TO SAVE LIQUIDITY AFTER THE LAST FUD POST ABOUT SOME BUM FUCK EXCHANGE WITH $1 MILLION 24 VOL GETTING HACKED. SERIOUSLY WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. THEN YOU HAVE SOUTH KOREA BANNING IT, NOT BANNING IT. INDIA BANNING IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCY IS AND ARE SCARED STUCK LIVING IN 1900S SHITTING IN A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM.

@_date: 2018-07-04 02:28:08
Much of it went to stock buybacks—more than $6.9 trillion of them since 2004, according to data compiled by Mustafa Erdem Sakinç of The Academic-Industry Research Network. Over the past decade, the companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 have spent an astounding 54 percent of profits on stock buybacks. Last year alone, U.S. corporations spent about $700 billion, or roughly 4 percent of GDP, to prop up their share prices by repurchasing their own stock. 
   John Shad, a former Wall Street CEO in charge of the Securities and Exchange Commission loosened regulations that define stock manipulation, corporate managers avoided stock buybacks out of fear of prosecution. That rule change, combined with a shift toward stock-based compensation for top executives, has essentially created a gigantic game of financial “keep away,” with CEOs and shareholders tossing a $700-billion ball back and forth over the heads of American workers, whose wages as a share of GDP have fallen in almost exact proportion to profit’s rise. 
But Montier shows that since the 1980s, public corporations have actually bought back more equity than they’ve issued, representing a net negative equity flow. Shareholders aren’t providing capital to the corporate sector, they’re extracting it.

Not when the filthy rich created both systems. They are cleaning the new out before taking it over. Please don't be this naive.

Look at the transaction. Make sure you didn't send to an exchange to trade.

Gotta love Bakkt.

This is assuming companies are reasonable and responsible. Companies don't tend to be either when they want to stretch earnings out as long as possible, as much as possible. Hell, banks are the worst. JPM just announced increased div and stock buy backs, in this shaky economy.
Why do these companies not reinvest into themselves for the future instead of propping up their stock price? There should at least be a limit and not account for 4% of the annual GDP.

You are right the most powerful organization in the world that controls the world economy isn't that serious. My bad. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:59:46
Oh ok Oracle. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:58:44
lol, the day traders really don't understand what's going on and it's hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 05:38:43
What drugs
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:49:16
What do you mean? This seems like great news.

Hey dumb dumb, history has a way of repeating itself. I know it's hard for some millennials to grasp this concept. Its not an opinion, its a fact.

My point is that specifically expressed that money has to be backed by gold and silver. THIS IS IN THE CONSTITUTION. The fed reserve bank directly opposes what was outlined in the constitution in regards to monetary policy.

All the day traders sitting on their hands like children. Whining when the next bull run will be. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 20:41:18
Looks like they do that once a month, relax.

Yes. Random people on Twitter know more than him. Thank you.

Yes, but ETH does it much better. This guy is a paid FUDer of ETH. Always trying to manipulate ppl into selling while hoarding massive amounts of ETH.

And Thomas Jefferson opposed this tremendously. All money was to be gold and silver. Or be backed by gold and silver. THE MAJORITY OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS STRONGLY OPPOSED FIAT MONEY BECAUSE THEY SAW HOW THAT HAD FAILED THROUGHOUT HISTORY. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:58:43
It is. People don't understand. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:34:55
Did you read the article? Its self explanatory. Companies are buying stock buy backs with some of them leveraged. This is artificial growth. ITT you don't understand this is a bubble, stupid.

Ok. Fair enough. I was just asking to have others analyze it.

Changes to coinbase caused this. DYOR.

Why are you a fat piece of human feces? 
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:16:43
Fuck Bakkt...
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:07:23
Why do we care? This is obvious FUD before they legalize it. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:11:51
As it relates to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:09:57
Just stop talking. Every time the community hears from you Bitcoin drops. Just fuck off dude.

True. I am doing both.
