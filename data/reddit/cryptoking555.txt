Thanks for your answer.  I have another question about the costs of becoming a node.  I am just an average Joe travelling.  I don't have a computer at all.  I only have a small, cheap, Android phone.  And because I'm travelling, I don't even have connection to the internet at times (ie. on the plane, etc).  
So how much would it cost me to become a node?  Will my cheap Android phone become the computing device that handles the work of being a node?  Do I even need a computing device to become a node?  Are there any additional fees that I get charged for becoming a node, especially if I leave the node open for the rest of the year?

Coinmarketcap.com is showing BTC price as $16.5 K right now but when I click into the markets section, most markets have BTC around the $15.5 K price point.  What is going on with coinmarketcap?

Why are people saying Bitcoin futures is driving down the BTC price?  What is the logic behind this?

That's why my original description was from the perspective of a traveller that only wanted to buy coffee from this coffee shop this one time.

So what's the reason for the run up in price today? I saw a huge spike from 11.7K to 12.6K.  Is there any new news out about Bitcoin that causes that spike?  Or is this spike not really news related but just people coming back to Bitcoin again after the recent sell off ?

Then you shouldn't buy.  Don't buy what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:58:15
Agreed.  The OP said he/she was a "newbie" though and is following what everybody else is saying in this thread.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:44:25
Alright.  I can see this.  But the market capitalization of BTC is so much, it would take a really rich person to manipulate the market like this.  You're talking about somebody richer than a billionaire.  Even somebody with the wealth of several hundred million wouldn't have enough capital to manipulate the BTC market.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:41:50
Ok, good.  Sounds like there is no downside to becoming a node and keeping this node open, especially when you get paid to be a node.  Heh, it sounds almost too good to be true :)

So you're saying it's $100 to enter the Lightning Network with "one big channel" and you can keep this channel open indefinitely?
Over my entire lifetime, $100 is like nothing if I can keep using the lightning network over and over again to purchase goods and services world wide.  But if I have to close the channel after a certain period, and then open it up again for another $100, it may add up (depending on how frequently I have to open and close the channel).
I'm looking at this from the perspective of a normal Joe who just wants to travel and buy cheap stuff but keep my overall costs down.

If I delete the wallet files (and delete Electrum), as long as I am reusing the private key from my paper wallet and I have recorded my private key down, deleting the wallet file shouldn't result in a loss of funds for me, right?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:05:05


Regarding this, I have read that reusing an address after you spend from it only leaves that address protection by ECDSA.  And that each time you spend from that address, you leave more signatures which makes it easier for your public address to be hacked (ie. deriving your private key from your public address).
Realistically though, do hackers even have that type of computer power and is this something that can be done over the next several months?  My intuition says the technology shouldn't be there yet but then again, if it's true that each time I spent from a public address, my address is more susceptible to be hacked, then I really don't know so that's why I'm asking others that know more about this in depth.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:06:44
Hmm, so if I decide to delete my wallet files, then I need to get the private key of the new address each time.

You realize that when BitcoinAlways is pasting your quote, some people may misinterpret your quote as coming from an official Binance rep?  That's FUD at its worse.  That's why I kept asking BitcoinAlways for a source, to see if that quote came from an official Binance rep.
I actually agree with your quote and from what I have read, the general hypothesis is pointing in the same direction with your quote.  What I don't like is another user (BitcoinAlways), posting your quote over and over, and some people may misinterpret that quote as coming from an official Binance rep (the bolding of your quote when BitcoinAlways pasted it just makes it worse).

I thought the pattern was BTC price drops on Sunday?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:09:29
And yet you won't post a link this quote.  Where did you get this quote from?  I'm starting to doubt this quote because you won't provide a source for it.
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:32:13
I thought people said the price of BTC usually drops on Sunday. Is this Sunday different than the previous ones?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:46:46
Link to this quote?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:46:38
Link to this quote?
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:54:08
LOL, why the huge drop?  Was it some type of news?
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:33:36
Isn't the pattern that BTC price usually drops on Sunday?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:27:28
Yes, the first half of his quote is consistent with the general hypothesis circling around.  But it's the second half of his quote that is dubious:
"Everything is fine, Binance itself isnt compromised. People gave access to their trading API to shady bots online"
This is still not known yet.  If that quote is from an official Binance rep, it has significant meaning because it means Binance has investigated this and has come out with a conclusion.  If it's from a random Redditor, then that part of the quote has no weight and is just some conjecture from a random Redditor.
He/she is posting that quote without attributing the source, and some people may mistaken that as coming from an official Binance rep (it appears it isn't).

Any reason why BTC is dropping now?  It was over 11K just a few hours ago and now it's dropping to 10K.  Any news out that is causing this?
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:14:09
Any specific news causing the rise of BTC today?  Or is just a general rally from the low 2 weeks ago?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:15:35
So why is BTC rising today?  I didn't see any specific news.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:41:34
So BTC was hovering around the 8.9K mark for the last several days, unable to punch through 9K.  Then it happens today.  Any specific news that is helping today's run?
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:42:31
So why the sudden jump today?  It's been wavering in the 6.6K to 7.1K range for the last several weeks.  Suddenly, today is a breakout from that range.
Any news causing this surge?
