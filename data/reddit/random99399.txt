Sorry for late reply.... Check the FAQ on AirBitz pages, in the Technical section:

AirBitz. Definitely. It is open source, all encrypted, distributed, 2-factor. Write down the master seed, that's for sure. There is no desktop version, but you are looking for mobile, so not an issue... I started with AirBitz, then installed Mycelium to check out and till now I am still not changing AirBitz for anything else. Btw, their support is as well very good - quick and helpful.

And if you don't like clicking PDF links like that, it can be found on this page: 
Go to bankofengland.co.uk, then Publications, Quarterly Bulletin, Year 2014, Q1.

I called SyriaRelief, their IT head and they confirmed that this site is fake, the page points to a fake bitcoin address. The police is involved to get it down. The real Syria Relief page is:

And where are all the other forms of donation, listed here: 
(the main page now links to this weird donation page with the bitcoin button...)

In addition, google does not have anything indexed with "bitcoin" on syriarelief.org. I may be wrong but this whole thing looks fishy to me...

Is this a real donation page? The address looks weird (indexb506.html) and when opening the main site and then clicking Donate, this option cannot be found. Also, on this weird page, there is only the card payment option or bitcoin. Bitcoin forwards to a simple coinkite page, where you should put your email address and then you can donate. Does it all look ok to you?? How one can check this is a genuine Syrian Relief bitcoin address?
