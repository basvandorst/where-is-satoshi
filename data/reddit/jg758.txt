Well done!  
Only part that tripped me up was the nocoiners selling coins they don't have.  I'd suggest either A) change "nocoiners" to "weak hands" or B) change "panic sell" to "FUD against us"
Just a thought.

A FB board member joined the Coinbase team...is that what you're talking about? 
I also did hear the rumor that Charlie was going to work for FB to integrate crypto so he sold off his LTC to avoid a conflict of interest, but I've seen nothing factual to back that up.  Just an internet rumor.

Yes. In fact, that's the better way to do it.  GDax will pay the transfer fees for you when you send to the other exchange (coinbase does not)

I wonder how many futures bets that are coming due in a couple of weeks are under water right about now.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:04:00
If I were you, I probably wouldn't do anything.  Hardware wallets are great, but if you only have a few hundred bucks, it's hard to justify a $100 investment.  Coinbase is insured, and they keep the majority of their assets in cold storage, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  
If you're planning on buying more now that it's on sale though, and end up increasing your investment, you really should look into a Trezor or Ledger.  If not, just go back to sleep until you start hearing about the new All Time Highs this summer in the mainstream media.

Putting my ignorance on display here, but it seems like the only advantage coinbase has over competing exchanges is their app. I mean, how hard would it be for Gemini, Bitstamp, etc to develop an app with a simple interface that allows buys &amp; sells like CB?

You definitely have a point about the conflicting practices of hoarding an asset that is expected to increase in value, while also expecting it to function as a currency.  In my view, no cryptocurrencies are really ready for "prime time" as a mainstream, global currency.  So for now, the name of the game is to add to your stack while the market determines its value.  If Lightning Network really does function as advertised and catches on as a payment system, that may be a game-changer, but it seems like we're still a ways off before that happens.

I don't think you can change your free from coinbase, but I hear if you send to your gdax wallet first (which is free to do since they're the same company and probably isn't even a blockchain transaction), your outbound transaction it's also free.

I've asked this same question, and haven't really gotten a concrete answer.  Best I've come across is, "just be consistent with how you report." 
I'd like to think that if I bought BTC for the sole purpose of trading for an Alt, that would be isolated from the balance I hodl, but I'm still not entirely sure it works that way.

Yeah, I hear ya...I was just throwing out a theory as to why someone might be fixated on the initial investment. But in general, I don't see anything wrong with some profit taking here and there. Sounds like you have a system that you're comfortable with. I gotta figure out what I want to do. I got into this with an all or nothing mentality, but you're right, once the figures start to rise, it'll make you reconsider what makes the most sense.

The problem I have is that they've shown zero interest in implementing Segwit. When Brian Armstrong said on national TV that segwit isn't a priority because their customers aren't asking for it, that told me all I need to know.  
Up to that point, I had assumed they were working on it, but I think that is a dangerous assumption now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:33:23
Shapeshift is what came to mind when I originally read that. But I honestly don't know what's going on behind the scenes there, or if this patent would affect them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:47:54
I keep hearing conflicting reports about Gemini and Segwit. One thread says they offer it, another says they don't.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:48:53
Just some thoughts...
I don't have any physical gold, and if I did, I don't know why I would want to send it to anyone else, but just to play this out...let's say I want to send to a family member in another state.  How do I go about doing that? Go down to the post office, pay the postal fee, pay to insure it's value in case it doesn't get where it's supposed to go, then wait for a few days for it to get there?  Or if I want it to get there sooner, I can, you guessed it - pay higher fees!
Just looking at that scenario, I think it's easy to see how Bitcoin is better than gold for a few reasons.  Meanwhile, the reason fees and transaction times are higher than they were is because a shitload of people are entering the space, which is also making hodlers a shitload of money to be able to afford these fees.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:11
Especially when it looks like it was only on GDAX

@_date: 2017-12-14 15:08:23
Not saying you should always cater to the lowest common denominator, but right now there is a ton of newbies entering the space, and I still think this type of change would be confusing.  
People hear of bitcoin's price skyrocketing lately, and then are faced with the decision of buying the one that's valued at $1800 or the one that's showing as $17.  You see how that might be a problem for some? Because, let's be honest, not everyone getting into cryptocurrencies at the moment is a Rhodes Scholar.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:47
Same here.  I hope they get completely flooded today. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:17
I just think it's terribly funny that the type of people saying bitcoin is just gambling are the same people who are literally just betting on bitcoin price though futures contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:31:22
Ummm...I'm not sure where you're seeing these "get rich quick" pitches on r/bitcoin. 
Any time I see newbie posts, the first piece of advice is usually the standard, "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" blah, blah.
I've only seen a handful of people mention taking out CC advances, or loans to buy BTC, and those posts are usually obliterated by people advising against it.  
This might not be the most financially literate place, but there is far more rational advice floating around than just hype-men yelling to sell everything and buy btc.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:24
This is the most solid bet I've seen yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:44
It's the easiest on-ramp for new users, with a simple interface and buying process, but if you want to get the best price and to save on fees, you can use GDAX. Some people don't even realize it's the same company and if you have a login to one, you have it for both. I think he's saying that more experienced users probably prefer alternatives to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:37:00
Doubt it. I'm sure if there was, Roger would have cited how bitcoin is losing ground in Twitter polls instead of answering simple questions about bch scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:45:32
Is it really though?  
Shouldn't it be more like bcash vs. litecoin, dash, etc.? As long as you're trying to compare coins that tout fast transactions for cheap fees because of a lack of users, we should really be comparing apples to apples.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:29:29

I should not have said "every transaction", you're right. I just meant to convey that you don't have to have discreet payment channel between two parties if there is already a common channel available.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:45:03
Not at all.  Instructions were pretty straightforward.  It's actually a lot like setting up the mobile wallets as far as writing down the recovery seed and all that. Other than that you might just have to download an extension for Chrome, or firmware update, but nothing difficult.

Same here.  I got more worked up on Tuesday night when I saw BTC price decreasing proportionally to BCH's rise.  I feel much better that everything is tanking together now.  
In the past month the total market cap increased from $245B to $646B, and now we're currently sitting around $435B.  Doesn't seem that awful when you look at the big picture.

I get the trepidation though.  These are the same institutions that the BTC community tends to distrust - and rightfully so.  Now we're inching closer to playing in the same sandbox, and it feels kind of weird. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:15:48
As someone who drug their feet with finally buying a hardware wallet, I do recommend it now.  I started with a small amount I was comfortable hodling on Coinomi, but after increasing my hodlings and watching the value increase, I eventually felt like I needed a hardware wallet. Especially after there was an issue with the software wallet, and my balances were showing zero for a couple of days...that scare finally motivated me to just go get a Ledger Nano S.  
Another benefit is that it's very convenient during all these forks.  They usually create a splitting tool that makes claiming your alt-coins (like Bcash, Bgold, etc.) pretty idiot-proof. Just something else to consider.

Even CNBC's automated response sucks...&gt;"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com"
The fact that they include his title shows just how confusing this whole thing is for the uninitiated.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:25:23
Copy/paste the destination address (and verify that it's correct), type in the amount to transfer.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, if you send to the wrong address or something, there is no getting those funds back, so you need to double check what you're doing, but it's not difficult.  
EDIT: I'd also say that it helps to begin with small amounts just to get comfortable with the process.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:46:59
I'm hopeful too, but even if it was ready for roll-out tomorrow, how long until people understand it enough to embrace it?  We don't even have Segwit adoption yet with major exchanges/wallets. I'm not hodling my breath for LN to fix things any time soon, which sucks to say. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:03

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:50

@_date: 2017-12-08 22:07:39
No doubt, if there is some catastrophic event, getting $ onto exchanges would be insane.  I personally keep my funds in a hardware wallet for security, and keep telling my brother in law to get his bitcoin off of exchanges because it's more secure.  But he likes to know that he can quickly sell if he needs to, so he keeps it on the exchange.  That's just a personal choice between security and being able to exchange quickly.  
Ideally, it won't always be like this, but I understand how frustrating it can be at times.  Especially like now when it's more profitable to mine bcash and we lose hashpower. I'm hoping these 2nd layer solutions are coming sooner, rather than later.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:28:41
I should have been more clear with my original question, but what I'm confused about is if these institutional players can already buy the asset directly, why not just pump &amp; dump on existing exchanges.  Why do they need the futures market as the vehicle to execute? 
I thought maybe there was something prohibiting investment firms from buying BTC directly so the futures market was the answer...but if that were the case, they wouldn't be able to buy the physical asset (BTC) in order to manipulate the price.  Their cash-settled environment would be a closed system, if that were the case. 
So I'm obviously missing something here.

I saw an interview with their CEO recently, during which he mentioned adding support for additional coins in 2018.  You have to believe that's their primary focus at this point over implementing SegWit. If a company has a choice between using limited resources towards something that is revenue generating vs. something that isn't, which do you think they're going to prioritize?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:12:54

The 1 hour chart for BCH on gdax is glorious. 
When are they going to release the BTC/BCH trading?  That sell wall is MASSIVE.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:14:47
He acts like people weren't ever going to invest in shitcoins. BTC could be worth $100k, and processing at Visa speeds and still wouldn't have 100% market share.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:39:11
There's nothing wrong with that.  The beef with CB is how they handled s2x, not even trying to implement Segwit, and then the suspect timing of this surprise bch launch.  It's pretty clear that they're no friend of BTC at this point, so why continue to give them business if it's a coin you want to see succeed?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:18:49
Gotcha, I need to watch that. I wonder if I'm referencing a reference of that movie via South Park.

I wonder what happened to that guy, and if he knows what he started. Hell, even mainstream articles are spelling it that way as a nod to the community. 
EDIT:  I also wonder if Craig Wright has ever claimed that it was him who made that post.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:31:21
True. I guess I was only thinking of the customer-facing SegWit wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:32:45
So....Roger can't mouth off to them about being a millionaire before bitcoin, is what you're saying?  I can dig it.

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:12:16
So you're saying bitcoin isn't currently the best store of value right now vs. other cryptocurrencies? I'm curious what you think is. Others might offer a different value proposition, but if no one it's using it, I wouldn't really call it the king. Right now, you can't dispute that people are using bitcoin and driving it to a ridiculous value that's far and away higher than any competitors. 
I'd like to see the fees addressed as well so bitcoin retains it's position as the flagship.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:30:37
Please, bitcoin is their cash cow. They're not concerned with transaction fees of their customers. If they were, why wouldn't they batch transactions and implement Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:30
So, this isn't the same thing as the failed S2X in November?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:06:49
I really doubt that's true.  Unless  are "stop crashing".  
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:54:41
Oh. Thanks for the heads up, I wasn't aware that this was an option
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:01:37
Thank you!
My biggest problem with what he did was hijack a segment about Bitcoin futures to push BCH, and then proceed to start talking about how the developers have crippled BTC, etc. That's the kind of pissing match that goes on here, but was totally out of place for a national forum that was looking to discuss things from an investment perspective. It makes the whole cryptocurrency space look bad to bring bickering/grudges to the forefront when we're looking for mainstream adoption. It just came off as petty and childish.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:35:12
Better response. I'm deleting my previous comment since it's not entirely accurate.

@_date: 2017-12-12 00:31:21
I was thinking the same thing. Need to get the attention of these people to let them know they just got played, and that he doesn't speak for the real bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:30
Yeah, but...even if we have a 30% correction right now, we'd be back where we were on Sunday.  That's not too crazy for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:02:46
I can see it both ways.  I get your argument, but I also see people going apeshit over the fact that BTC is $15,000!!!! It's a gaudy number and the price is getting thrown all around national and social media bringing a lot of attention to the space.  Reporting that 1mBTC is now $15 - although making it sound more accessible to the average potential "investor" - steals some of the thunder, and doesn't sound nearly as impressive. 
Also, BTC is king, and any novice who might get duped into buying BCH can still easily see that one is currently valued at $15k, and the other is $1.3k. Why voluntarily give up that kind of status?
I realize none of this really matters to experienced users who know what's what...but if the goal is to increase mass adoption, I still think the ridiculous sounding price appeals to the masses.  Making sure to promote that fractional ownership is possible is just the challenge.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:07
This is what I'm waiting for!

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:51
I think we're talking past each other.  I'm not really arguing against anything you're saying.  I'm just saying coinbase is making it abundantly clear that their interests don't align with my own, so why should I continue to support their business? It's not just listing BCH that I have a problem with, hence the reason I'm ok with Bittrex or anyone else providing a platform for BCH as well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:14:58
I think that's why you see the alts booming lately.  
"Bitcoin has to go to $34k to just double my money, but if (insert random shitcoin here) takes off like bitcoin did, I can be a millionaire too!!!"  
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:20
They're making themselves look so incompetent, and this was all easily avoidable.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:37:40
I used Mycelium, Bread, and Coinomi on my mobile phone when I first started just to play around with them...and because I started out with only a couple hundred bucks.  Once I bought more and the value kept increasing, I finally felt like it was worthwhile to invest in a hardware wallet because I wasn't comfortable keeping over a certain amount on a mobile phone.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:00:02
Ask people about claiming their Bcash or Bgold when they keep their coins on Coinbase.  You're at their mercy as to if/when they will credit you with the amount you're entitled to.  With a hardware wallet, you own your keys, and can claim forked coins - usually with a simple splitting tool that the wallet manufacturers provide. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:41
Difference between "rich" and WEALTHY.  Who knows the kind of stack she's sitting on.  Bill Gates gave away, what?  Like 4 Billion, and I think he's still doing ok.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:10:16
It can hold all the coins they support, but only about 4 display at a time.  If you want to access other coins you have stored on it, you have to delete an app to make room, and then install the app for the coin you want to use.  
Like Rock said, i'ts kind of a pain, but if you're using for long-term storage, it's not that big of a deal.  Takes all of 10 seconds to install these apps.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:52:12
Yeah, that's the drawback - waiting for a deposit to clear.  Sometimes I just suck it up and accept the fees on Coinbase just to get the price locked in.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:17:25
That would be epic if they dumped them today
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:47:52
That's a good point, but for now, bitcoin is king as far as a store of value goes. Could there be a massive shift to an alt? Sure, but it won't happen overnight. Bcash made it's bid as the heir apparent and wasn't embraced when it was within striking distance.
I'm just hoping utility can be improved before that type of mass migration happens. I know it feels like segwit and LN have been dangled like carrots for a while, but it sounds like we might be getting close. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:53:49
Listening to ESPN Radio just now, and they have a quick "Market Scoreboard" segment that runs down stock prices...they just included bitcoin in that segment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:49
So can people dump their BCH now, or not until the 1st?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:24
When are they going to "release the hounds"?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:41:09
And now all I can think of is "I'm rich, biiiatch!" (honk, honk)
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:32:34
It's just sending an amount from one address to another.  Nothing different between an exchange and a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:30:25
It is a desperate play.  There is no "secret sauce" for bcash, only bigger blocks and a lack of users. When actual innovation is implemented into Bitcoin with LN, etc., they know their coin will be... maybe not worthless, but definitely worth less.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:57:51
I broke the dam.  
Wait..what are we doing again?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:03:48
I've read this somewhere before too, but was curious about how that recipient claims that as income.  If you were to sell, and give the cash value to someone else, they would report it as regular income, and not as capital gains, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:05
I don't follow.  If these institutional investors are able to buy BTC directly to pump, as you say, then why can't they just short it the same way?  Meaning, why do they have to use futures as the vehicle to short if they can buy/sell directly on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:56

What is a good alternative?  Do ANY exchanges support Segwit yet?  If so, I'd happily switch, and advise as many as I could to do the same.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:08
Hell yeah!  But now we're seeing the big selloff and crazy volatility that we saw when we first hit $10k.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:17:48
Is there an alternative to Mycelium that is hardware wallet compatible?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:34:13

I play live blackjack on mybookie.ag. Instantly deposit with Cc, and cash out winnings in Btc. Takes them about 48 hours to review/approve payout, but they've been reliable.

Why even associate bitcoin with him anymore?  He's irrelevant to the community. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:51
Yeah, there are a lot of buys piling up too.  Who knows which way things will swing. Should be entertaining though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:46
Same here!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:45:46
Defining that "life-changing" part is the tough part.  All I know is I have time to figure it out.  I'm obviously nowhere near the profit taking stage if I still want to buy more every dip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:16:27
When the hell are they going to open up the BCH/BTC trading though?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:56:41
Between this blog entry, how he pushed S2X (and didn't sign the letter calling off the fork), refuses to work on implementing Segwit, and then the suspect timing of this surprise launch of bch amidst high BTC mining difficulty and FUD campaign, it's pretty obvious that there is some collusion going on here, and that he/CB is no friend of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:26
Maybe you get another chance. We might need some time to recharge before the real run to $20k
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:27:24
Yeah, I got the same blog link talking about moving your coins before the hard fork. Has nothing to do with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:29:57

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:17:32
I think you hit on something big that may not be entirely understood by everyone (if I'm understanding correctly). The key part of LN is the NETWORK part - meaning you don't necessarily have to open and close payment channels between two individual parties for every transaction.

Gdax was the only exchange I saw get that high...the others I checked were all around $16k still when that crazy run up happened, so I kind of chalked it up as an anomaly.

Depends.  I generally think the outlook for 2018 is bright. With futures trading starting this quarter, ETF approval might finally be on the horizon, maybe China gets back in the mix, who knows? 
The turd in the punch bowl right now is S2X though.  Everything depends on surviving the mining shenanigans and keeping Bitcoin Bitcoin on the major exchanges.

I was excited to use my hardware wallets with mycelium, only to find out they still don't support segwit. Wtf?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:03:34
I'm more worried about the S2X Futures being pumped up all of a sudden (as high as $2400 earlier, currently hovering around $2k), and the sudden rise in BCH.  
For everyone counting on BTC being more profitable for miners, it's troublesome to see the other 2 alternatives increasing in value as we get closer to the fork.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:02:58
I thought the early seasons were alright, but holy crap that show got awful in a hurry.

@_date: 2017-11-09 00:20:02
Thanks, man. Yeah, I'm not big into using BTC as currency anyway, but mostly because of how the gov classifies it - so it's not a problem unique to bitcoin. I'm not trying to keep track of gains and appreciated value every time I make a small purchase just to be compliant with tax laws. I'm also not trying to go to jail though. Sucks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:40:21
I guess I take HODL as more of a rallying cry during price dips/corrections - the alternative to panic selling.  I don't usually see anyone berating someone for spending their BTC.  The only negative words I hear when people discuss buying goods with bitcoin is usually from the posters themselves talking about the regret they have for pissing away bitcoin on dumb shit.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:44:45
If you didn't sell, you haven't lost anything. You just bought some more at a price lower than it was this morning. Nothing wrong with that. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:56:00
First, don't think about it as a "crash". It's not crashing. Call it a dip, correction, or whatever you want, but this isn't catastrophic.  
I first bought in at an all time high in June, only to watch it go from $2700 down to around $1800 in July because of the upcoming BCH fork.  
Then, the all time high in September dropped from around $4900 to $3100 because of the China ban. 
The things those two events have in common is that the price recovered, and went on to even higher highs.  
I don't know for certain what's causing this current dip, but it sure smells like some Bcash fuckery is going on right now. Aside from that, the price was a little overbought from people expecting "free" 2X coins, so we should have expected a bit of a drop.  We just rode a wave of breaking all time highs every other day, and that's hard to sustain.  So I'm thinking of this as just another instance where Bitcoin needs time to "recharge" until the next surge.  
Keep your head up and don't let the FUD get you down.

It seems like the same couple of clowns keep causing problems, but you gotta see that kind of approach is gong to be like a high stakes game of whack a mole when hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake. There will always be someone else wanting to take control. We're just now getting to be a blip on the radar of major financial institutions now, there will be bigger challenges in the future. I'm hoping we (pronounced: people smarter than I) can keep focus and continue to make bitcoin stronger and more resilient than ever for the next attack.

The major dip was 2 weeks before the fork of BCH.  We didn't see that this time around because there are a whole lot of factors that are different.  No one knows exactly how this will play out. If you want to buy, buy and don't sweat it.

The beauty of it is if they want to spend it, the have to first figure out what the hell it is, how to get it off a paper wallet, send to an exchange, and cash out. After putting in that kind of time to learn about it, maybe they get interested and want to hodl...or they hodl because they're lazy and make money on accident.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:29:26
$8k's being a real bitch. But after testing it a few times, I have more confidence it will actually hodl once we do cross it.

@_date: 2017-11-01 14:43:57
Yeah, I personally don't get the obsession with wanting to buy coffee w/BTC. I've already got a few ways I can do that with ease, and there is no real "need" that BTC is addressing.  
Honestly, I don't see the reason for brick &amp; mortar businesses, in general, to be involved right now. "Magic internet money" is great for using on the INTERNET.  If I buy something that's not shipping for a day or two anyway, what do I care if the transaction takes 4 hours to get verified?

Buying &amp; holding.  I know buying near ATHs sucks, but I've been pretty obsessed with getting to 1 full BTC, and I was finally able to get over the top last night!  Might seem stupid to some, but it was a personal goal from when I first started buying 6 months ago. 
I've got everything in hardware wallets, so I just plan to ride it out, and see what happens with the splitting tool development from Trezor &amp; Ledger and decide what to do then.  I really don't have much desire to be a first mover and try to sell off the S2X distribution immediately. If it ends up being worthless, I consider that a win for Bitcoin, and really won't care about any $ I missed out on by not selling immediately. Big picture is more important.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:54:46
I can't really give you a good comparison, I just got my Trezor about a week ago, and only set it up...haven't really used it much. Ledger is pretty straightforward though. I just got an OTG cable, trying to figure out how to use them with mycelium now so I can use them with my phone. Looks like you can do that with both though. I don't think you can really go wrong with either.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:50:45

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:10:22
^This! BTC has been draining alts lately, so some flowback is to be expected.  But $10K by the end of the year doesn't sound so far fetched now that this 2X cloud isn't hanging out there anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:37:11
That's the way to go.  Seems like I hear more people that end up screwing themselves than those who actually end up with more BTC by trying to time highs/lows. 
Also consider if you cash out that's a taxable event, even if you buy back in.  If you don't care about taxes, cool, but if you do, it just sounds like another pain in the ass thing to have to track/report. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:14:26

@_date: 2017-11-29 21:13:07
Basically.  That's why $10k was so hard to crack yesterday.  Lots of people had that set as their target to sell. Now today, more people took some profits, the price dips and some people make the mistake of panicking and selling off too so it dips more.  I'm sure you'll see posts from people in a couple of days regretting that they had to buy back in higher because they panic sold.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:24:25
Eh, that might have been bad. Who would have been planting corn with all that porn?

Been stuck at 0.91 for a minute.  I've been trying to cash out some winnings from an online casino via btc - which would have put me over the top - but their payout shenanigans are taking too long, and since the price keeps going up, I think I'm still going to be short once it's finally processed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:25:02

This is an important post. I think it's good to recognize that challenges and perceived threats make the community more battle hardened.

Just a thought.

Same here. I know my gains could evaporate tomorrow, but this has been a great way for me to save. I get pumped contributing to my position, and look for ways to free up more cash instead of spending on stupid shit. Yeah, I still max my employer match on 401k, and have some savings in fiat, but those things don't move the needle like BTC does. I know it's not a very responsible method of "saving"in the truest sense of the word, but it's really encouraged me to save more by investing.

It's so much easier these days for people to hear a sound bite, read an abstract from an article, or see a meme and regurgitate a dismissive point of view, rather than take the time to inform themselves, understand the situation, and form a valid opinion. BitCoin doesn't suffer fools. It takes some legit work to understand the underlying tech (at least at a basic level), learn the history of the market and appreciate the factors that have helped/hurt the ecosystem in the past to be able to project the future, and finally learn how to buy/store/transact without screwing everything up. 
It's not easy, so I love that those who take the time are being rewarded for their efforts. It's much easier to be lazy and just find the easiest excuse to dismiss it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:16:44
I think most free clinics can test you for it now.

Who knows, man.  I'm not an experienced TA guy, but looking at the charts, it's obvious that we're still in this downtrend, and we won't know for sure we're out of it until the price gets much higher.  If you're not a "trader", it boils down to if you believe in BTC long-term.  If so, now seems like a great time to buy.  Trying to guess the bottom though is probably a fool's errand.

Exactly. Today's ATH = Tomorrow's DIP

That's a great idea. It might even go national, and you could open up a whole chain of bars. Better start planning how you're going to scale your business now, or there will be a bunch of jabronis copying your idea and claiming theirs is better because they have slightly more square footage.

Even though I'm in it for the long haul, and am not a trader, that doesn't stop me from refreshing price charts like an idiot all day.

It's seriously played out at this point...but I still watch it to competition every time. I can't help it.

I give your plan two thumbs up! (Or one, as it were. My other one is also tied up at the moment)

Or you could just send it to me. Maybe I split it with you when it's worth $50k, but you can consider it as good as gone and rest easy in the meantime! Just trying to help you out :)

There is a quarterly earnings call at 2:30 Pacific Time today.  I guess that's when people are expecting the rumored announcement.

Oh shit! Somebody somewhere must have said bitcoin is a bubble...or something about tulips. Sell!!!

I'm fully expecting some vague, non-committal, "we're thinking about looking into blockchain technology" announcement, if anything. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:09:22
You're right. This could be a cautionary tale if it was invested in Bcash

Definitely. And I will be pissed if their view doesn't align with mine, but for now, I don't "hate" how they're handling this.

Congrats. BitCoin has a way of baptizing by fire. I've only been in since June, but it feels like much longer because of all the turbulence. I personally can't wait until these forks are done with.

But it was obviously an amount you could afford to lose since you didn't even notice it was missing. That's BitCoin 101, so you're good.

The recent big dips had external causes...the impending Aug 1 fork &amp; China shutting down exchanges. I had assumed we'd see a similar drop with the 2x fork, but this time it seems as everyone is running towards the fork, maximizing BTC holdings to get "free money".

The biggest lag in the whole system is still having to wait a week for my bank deposit to go through to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:37:14
That's a good call. Is it standard practice for them to request photos of your CC and ID though?
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:20:10
Right? Talk about centralization...a single point failure, and trillions stop moving.

I don't even know which (if any) exchanges are supporting it. Crazy lack of information with this fork

A whole new wave of people waking up to find there's still no dip to buy
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:42:34
Same here.  I won about $3k on the SB a couple of years ago, and was super worried about my bank accepting the Canadian check I got from Bovada, but it went through without issue.  I just started getting back into online gaming this week, and it seems like using BTC is going to let me breathe a little bit easier. 
One thing that is strange though, is that they're still making me verify my CC before I can request a payout in BTC.  Seems kind of unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:32:50
Word. Nothing wrong with that. For the record, I do  wish they'd come out with a statement like Bitfinex already.

Hi Jamie. Was it difficult getting your head so far up your own ass?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:11:32
No worries. Even if you were extremely experienced with TA, I wouldn't trust you ;)
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:09:56
Unpopular opinion, but I fully agree. Aren't we supposed to assume that everyone in this ecosystem is going to act in what they think is their own best interest? I'd rather they give their customers the choice, and let the market decide. When they start taking sides, there's a chance they might not be on your side next time around.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:14:15
Definitely great advice. Been doing what I can, when I can. Just takes some patience.

Meh. Today's ATH is tomorrow's dip.

Since we stopped making ATHs.  Gotta pass the time somehow.

I'm not seeing it either.  We've basically been in a big channel for the last few weeks.  Maybe we don't hold that upward slope and drop out of that channel, but I don't see any major intersection up ahead that would drive that kind of move.  Not sure what OP is talking about.
