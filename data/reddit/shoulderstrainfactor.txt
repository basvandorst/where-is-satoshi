Since early March, there has been decreasing fluctuation between peaks and valleys.  Also, the amount of time between peaks and valleys has been decreasing.  This, combined with the obvious downward trend suggests an underlying psychological phenomenon on the part of the day traders:  They're increasingly competing with each other, and not market as a whole.  Each pump might be correlated with an external event, such as regulation changes, etc.  Once the pump gets going, the day traders dump increasingly more easily, willing to avoid coming too close to the next peak.  This is what's causing the increasingly rapid cycling between the peaks and valleys.  At this point, the only thing that will cause a meaningful bull run is a massive and sustained investment by whales.  The thing about whales is, they tend to be conservative investors.  So, this massive bull run won't start until the price gets to about 2K.  Sure, there could be a "teaser" bull run at 4k, pumping us to over 10k, but this won't last.  Not until big money gets infused at 2K will the current 2018 cycle be broken.

This was the beginning of the beginning, then it was the middle of the beginning, then it was the near-end of the beginning.   But now?  Wow, it isn't even the middle of the near-end!  
Folks, this is the bottom of the top and the top of the bottom!  This is the left pulled all the way to the right, and then moved further right until it circles around and becomes the left once more.
It's a-zig-zaggin' and a womp boppin'!

Thanks for the reply.  My understanding is that with exchanges, in order to sell at a precise time, someone must be willing to buy at that precise time.  Is this true?
