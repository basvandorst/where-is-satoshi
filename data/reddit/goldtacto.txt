I didn't say to avoid paying taxes. You can read my reply to the other guy if you really care. Sorry if I wasn't clear.

Your bank is required to report your transaction to the IRS if it reaches $10,000. I'm not telling anyone to avoid submitting their form-8300 with your transactions. But rather to avoid exceeding $10,000 to avoid extra complications. IRS will call and do things like put holds on your account, force tax extraction and sometimes even take your money if you aren't careful with it even if you plan to submit a Form-8300 That's why its good to avoid making $10,000 transactions.

You should un-color Hawaii as you are technically not allowed to purchase cryptocurrency there if you are a local resident.

Not sure which country you’re in but if its US dont withdraw $10,000 you can do $9999 but the second you hit $10k you get flagged by IRS and you will be taxed. Just a small tip.

Garbage website filled with moonboys. Kirby was right about the .618 stop at 14k, he was right about the bounce back to 13k, and hes probably gonna be right about the massive correction in a couple days to the downside due to this bull trap thats going on.

Political stances aside Sanders has not made a single comment regarding crypto yet to my knowledge. He shouldn’t be in the feed as he has no spoken stance on the matter.

Because this sub is filled with people that don’t understand bitcoin and only hold .01 BTC.

Most people haven’t looked much into this. Binance put out a statement that they believe its data breach is fake. An anonymous person is claiming to have photo ids and information of a hunch of people and are asking for a ransom of 300 BTC. But so far all the photo ids they anonymous person has released were already part of a security breakdown that people already knew about in 2013 ish (sorry can’t remember the date). So until they send  information of people in 2019. Binance is holding off on calling it an actual security breach.

If you’re looking for reputable TA thats been around since 2013. Crypto Kirby. The guy is a little goofy, but he’s the equivalent of a professional underground stock trader.

All though I do agree his “VIP” is a ripoff. I just watch his videos so I don’t give a shit if he takes a bunch of peoples money since you have to be an actual ape to buy into that. Regardless, he’s made more good trade analysis’ than bad ones.
