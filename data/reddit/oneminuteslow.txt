I think in the mass market, 2% is more than enough to take notice of, especially when a lot of the bulk buyers (Nintendo, PC manufacturers) probably buy the parts for a tiny fraction of the price. Also, we haven't factored in how many AMD GPUs are used for Folding the second half of that bulleted reference.

I don't really understand the proposed solution at all.

Do you suppose this will have a near-future effect on bitcoin value? Perhaps with the release of the miners, there will be an influx of people selling bitcoins to cover the cost of the systems?
@_date: 2012-06-17 02:46:04
I feel this doesn't adequately explain what you want to do, and what you want us to do. I was left pretty lost by the end.

You're not getting downvoted by bitcoin haters. You're getting downvoted because your love for the currency is correlated to the price of the currency, implying you care only about bitcoin for the sake of making a quick buck.
Also because this is an incredibly uninformative post that contributes nothing to the board.

Good article, but please make your post title a little more informative next time.

Bitcoin is still early tech, and LN is in its earliest stage of infancy. By the time it begins to reach mainstream, all of the technical details will be performed in the background without users having to worry about it, or even understand how it works.
Internet technology was similar, in that it was originally for tech enthusiasts, and it was just not convenient enough for "regular people" to start using in lieu of libraries, stores, public meets, etc. Bitcoin, LN, and future additional layers will be easier and more efficient to use than our current financial systems.

There's a difference between being unable to donate and refusing to donate. If you live in a country where supporting free information is dangerous, then you are unable to donate, and that is understandable. edit: But, if you live in a country where prepaid Visa cards are available in supermarkets, then there's a fine anonymous alternative.

Pretty sure a lot of ASIC miners have the same form factor and connectors because it's become a standard. It makes it easier for large-scale miners to have standardized mounting racks that fit a variety of ASIC hardware. No sense in making yours a different shape and inconveniencing all your customers.

This is the "I could have made more money if I ______" mindset. People with 10 BTC are saying "if only I got in earlier I would have 1000 BTC". No matter when you get in, there is *always* a way to have made more. But if you truly believe in the technology, and you hold your coins until it becomes mainstream, you will win no matter what.
.0005 BTC is still 50000 satoshis, which will have great spending power one day. Don't let decimals make you feel insignificant.

Mining centralization is only a temporary problem. The simpler the hashing algorithm, the more feasible it is for many manufacturers to make their own ASICs. Changing PoW discourages new companies from getting into mining because their investment could become obsolete at the drop of a hat. Meanwhile, those with the infrastructure to invest more in mining can once again leave everyone else in the dust.
But the efficiency of SHA256 mining is going to reach a plateau, which will create a more stable market that encourages more companies to invest in manufacturing ASICs. This means there won't be "latest and greatest" chips every 6 months for the big companies to monopolize, so they will stop buying up the entire supply. There will be more incentive to ship the ASICs to consumers.
Basically, you can keep changing PoW so that only a few select companies can keep up, or you can keep the PoW at the simplest possible which will lead to an accessible, stable, and decentralized ASIC market.

There is a thread about this on the Bitcoin Forum:

Disable Crossfire and check again, just to be safe. With Crossfire enabled, my miner still saw 2 cards, but I had a huge performance hit.

Should the logo include Snoo, or no?

Looks pretty cool, but isn't the introduction of a transaction fee negating one of the primary advantages of BTC over standard currency?
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:01:01
No one so far has mentioned profitability. The difficulty will reach a natural equilibrium with the amount that the electricity costs, so we'll eventually be seeing this graph flatten out.
@_date: 2011-06-15 20:02:57
The latest Bitcoin client no longer even has the "Generate" option because it's so useless.
I have approximately $600 in video cards (1.1Ghash) and, until today's difficulty increase, have gotten about 2BTC a day, maybe less depending on the luck of the pool.
@_date: 2011-06-29 17:34:13
More powerful cards require more electricity. That trend will probably remain approximately the same as the years pass.
@_date: 2011-12-20 16:02:39
That's because you're viewing the baseline relative to that enormous spike. It makes much more sense to zoom in the graph such that you do not include the spike, and analyze it as such.
@_date: 2011-06-15 20:28:47
At your rate, why not just go solo?

Pretty good idea, but it might violate the TOS. It's technically not all too different from selling a jar full of coins.

Yes, but I was referring to the functionality of the client.

It's free to use. Some of what you see are variations of the design made by users. I assume that these are also intended to be free to use, but if not, the worst that would probably happen is that you'd be asked to remove the graphics from whatever you're designing.

Buy while the price is low.

Ten minutes is a lot if you're, say, buying something from a local shop.

So, you're basically asking: "If the value keeps going up and I can make risk-free money, why isn't this blowing up in the media?"
Well, the error you're making is that it's not risk-free. It's an investment that is full of risks. You are investing money into it by paying for the electricity required to mine the coins (I pay $150/month for mining expenses alone). On top of that, the price of bitcoins is very capable of decreasing or even crashing depending on what happens to the market. So, it's really an investment like any other - with its risks.
Besides, many media outlets have already touched upon bitcoins. The other reason it's not all "mainstream" is probably that its fundamental design is very against standard monetary policy (no central bank, purely deflationary, etc.), leading many people to believe that it's a scam or a failure. Hope that's reasonably informative.

I usually tell people something like: "A miner runs a program on his computer that works really hard to do a bunch of algorithms. The algorithms help verify everyone's transactions, and the miner is awarded bitcoins for doing the hard work to help the network."
So, I'd say the best explanation is that "Miners get money by solving math puzzles that help secure the network".

The bitcoin price is so malleable that I would be willing to bet it's just one person performing a massive sellout. I wouldn't pay much mind to it.

Um, that's because when people search for Bitcoin, they're going to search for Silk Road after they learn about it.
In other words, Bitcoin search volume correlates to both Bitcoin price and Silk Road search volume. Silk Road search volume does *not* correlate to Bitcoin price.

I think we should only worry about this when we see $1 USD cost less than .01 BTC.

Eh, I guess that's the issue. Has anyone figured that out yet? It seems like an annoying flaw.

Can someone explain to me why the OP's comments always get downvoted in this type of post?
@_date: 2011-08-05 20:29:07
Yeah, but that only decreases the risk by a little. If bitcoins crash, that's still a lot of lost money.

Yes, but you need some programming knowledge. Google's Docs API lets you update the contents of Google spreadsheet cells via external software, so you'd need to write a program which pulls the latest Bitcoin values and writes them into the cells. Some information here: [Link](
