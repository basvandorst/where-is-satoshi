Free for the people obtaining it, at the time. There's no need for your pedantry.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:44:28
just did.

Wasn't that the sell order on a single 15k trade, and not on the market price, ie wasn't it a single person selling off cheaply.

I know, I'm quite distraught about not having to desperately cling to a cryptocurrency to secure my financial future. Woe is me, the evil socialist state has provided me with a skill set that allows me to achieve :'(

Le monopoly on violence lolol

The QFA in me is crying.

Cringe cringe cringe

It's sensible, pretty bad as a sign of confidence in bitcoin volitility.

Lower rate 20%, $8,000 tax credit, higher rate (kicking in at $45,000) of 41%. Over all I pay about 30% tax. Sorry again.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:23:18
Excellent riposte.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:33:30
Of course, the price has to shoot up because....well, because it did before!!

You'd have to be a citizen.

Do you not think there is a difference between a single seller selling at a price and the median market price. I mean, I could sell 3BTC for 0.01c, would you then be gloating that the price had hit 0.01c? Likewise, I could put in a buy order for 3,000...would I be able to then exclaim that the price has it 3,000?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:25:01
Price right now is 641USD....
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:02:59
Good luck with that.

If I steal a loaf of bread, it is now free for me, and a cost for someone else, once again, pedantry to prove something pointless.
I have no student debt, and was not required to pay for my education, for, it was free, this is not a difficult concept to grasp, especially considering the comment I was replying to was about student loans.

No, he directly said past performance **IS** and indicator of future growth.

When a freeze on 6.6% of the market can pull down the prices 12.5% in a day, you've got more serious stability problems than just Gox.

A flat line is neither linear nor exponential.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:06:13
You can split a graph up into infinity and call each piece linear.

Whoring out your degree (I also have an econ degree, and a qualification in financial planning) to back up propaganda is shameful. It's hilariously depressing that these fringe subreddits seem to think that Austrian economics isn't a bizarre outlier, most of which is generally regarded as useless.

About 6% of all BTC
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:38:50
And as of now, $670

The opportunity cost was working a minimum wage job. The opportunity taken was a free education providing two qualifications.
Wikibot what is a moot point.

What are the first four words of his comment to me?
@_date: 2014-02-18 11:17:14
My country has free education, sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:25:30
If you don't know the answer you probably shouldn't comment.

It means an extra €20,000 per annum to me ;)

Question, stores that accept bitcoin, do they adjust their prices according to the value of bitcoin changes. As in, if the value of bitcoin falls, do they up what they charge in BTC?

"Free education" is the scheme under which I paid no money, this is not a difficult concept to grasp. If I give a homeless man a sandwhich, to him, it is a free sandwhich, whether I paid for it is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:50:59
Where did I say it was a fat finger whatever...and where did I say it was a low volume.. To clarify, I'm not a fan of bitcoin, look at my comment history, I'm simply questioning your logic about the price levels.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:35:07
You don't need to believe in bitcoin to make a quick buck. I got in at $100 and sold at $800, it's a pity I didn't wait a little to hit the peak but I'm happy.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:24:33
I already said in my other comment...
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:06:27
Thank Christ past performance is an indication of future results.
@_date: 2014-02-18 08:05:59
Your thinking falls short considering many governments have already given up control of monetary policy.
