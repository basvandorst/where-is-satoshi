Huh ok so their losing a lot of trust from people. What are good companies trust worthy to trade/sell/buy bitcoin?

You can never know if it will crash as it's the first(correct me if I'm wrong) online currency so no body really knows where is it going to go.

Huh ok cool thanks.

How did you transferred from Gdax to Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:05:55
I know it's too late now but why wouldn't you play a little with Bitcoin before you decide to go big? It's definitely a big risk. I just got into bitcoin myself and I don't dare to invest big because of fear of losing everything (also because it's already huge I don't see it going above 20k).
I'm not expert in any means but (and I could be wrong) I believe that after the New Year it will go up again. The reason it's low right now it's because of the Taxes so maybe people don't want to claim too much.  This it's just an speculation on my part so I'm not sure what will happen.  Best of luck to you.

I know right I do that for  $25 transactions.  For 70k I probably have a witness and screen shot every page. Sheesh 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:38:32
I'm curious why?
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:58:35
Are you located in the US? I always wondered if it's based on location.
