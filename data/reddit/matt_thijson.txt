Their prices for laptops are actually competitive. I agree that their desktops are a joke, but with their laptops, you hardly pay any more than for other laptops with similar specs. The difference that may or may not be worth the premium price for you is aesthetics and build quality.

Maybe it could be done so the card reader doesn't see the private key, but gives it its public key?

I like how they're aligned like images for a sprite/button. Someone would see the the image, click on it and as he clicks on it, the image changes for the litecoin one and he's redirected to a litecoin exchange.

Can you explain why these transactions are bad for me? I don't see how a random person sending me this transaction could be harmful.

Ashton Kutcher is the first celebrity I saw talking about bitcoins. He tweets about it from time to time like during the big bitcoin shops sale there was in 2013.
@_date: 2014-06-16 03:16:11
In this case, we could do as another person suggested, and make the card a physical wallet with a screen on it. It would cost more though.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:40:37
No one has any "right" to be in a coffee shop. It is a private property just like a house is, which means you can get kicked out for whatever reason they want. On top of that, the ATM guys have a contract with the owner of the place which state that their ATM will be the only thing allowed to sell bitcoins inside. Of course if he does it outside then it would still be illegal since he is probably unlicensed.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:09:23
The thing is, if you have the money to reimburse the payments on a CC, then as a costumer you have no reason not to use it since you build up credit and depending on the card you use, you get bonuses so you get paid to use it.  
The commercant is the only one who gets shafted from credit cards.
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:05:06
I would actually like it if he sold most of them. It would make the price drop quite a lot for some time, but we would benefit from it in the long term since there would no longer be a single person owning 1/21 of all the possible bitcoins that can exist. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:07:39
I can't wait for graphene. This thing will be a huge game changer when it becomes a viable.

Who's this proclaimed CEO of bitcoin everyone is always talking about? I'm guessing it's referring to Shrem since it's the only arrest stated in OP's list?

Really? I've heard that pure graphene could increase the performance by over 100 folds. Like having a 128 core CPU.   
Also,  I've read that the electrical resistance is so low that you could run a powerful CPU with a barebone fan-less heat sink. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:04:31
It depends with which bank/credit union you're with. The one I'm with I can't use debit cards online except for paypal and it takes several days for the money to show up. Theyre pretty much cheques without the paper. I need a CC if I want to easily buy anything online.
@_date: 2014-06-07 14:10:51
I only pay fees for my CC if I dont pay for it before the end of the month. I'm in Canada.

Thanks, do I need to do something if the transactions stay unverified or should I still cover my tracks? From what I understand they could use it to find out who I really am, but idk if it's such a big deal to me...

A good investor buys when it's dropping and sell when it's rising. You're encouraging to do the opposite.

HEY! We are like brothers. I have a little over 7.2 bitcoins and the average price at which I bought them was 555 (Canadian $ though).

I once got tipped 0.1 btc back when it was worth less than 10$. Feels pretty nice to see it grow. It's not all that I own, but it's the first btc I ever got.

Can someone tell me why you would invest in this rather than buying actual bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:58:38
I think what he meant to say is to buy when the price is dropping, but not try to time the market by (trying to) selling high and buying to.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:48:30
Indeed my dude. The wait for the last bubble was insane. All those people who got in early 2018 complaining about the price drop have no idea what it's like being 3+ years in the red.

Yeah since I have no idea if it is being monitored, I don't use it for any illegal activity like downloading torrents, but only to access stuff that I can't access in Canada.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:40:01
Same thing here... I ended up buying at 600. Still profitable, but I could of made so much more...
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:27:53
If your post was sarcastic, then here's what I have to say. Smart exchangers buy wen the price are dropping and sell when they are raising.

This made me realize, am I the only bitcoin supporter who believes having some sort of socialism in place is a good thing? The reason I support bitcoins is because it fights inflation of fiat currencies, not because I believe in an individualistic society. I'm not saying that I support what they said in this video though.
@_date: 2013-08-16 11:03:35
I agree, I found that overall, this was a pretty good representation of what bitcoins are. The one thing they got wrong is by saying that bitcoins are backed by nothing. While technically it's not backed by anything physical, it's backed by supply and demand on a limited ressource, just like how gold gets its value. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:05:01
I don't know much about those, but I heard people saying the way they work is shady. I don't really know why though.

Yes I did, but I don't really see how it's relevant to what I said.

Thanks for the input, I just did.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:41:14
Depending on how many bitcoins you own, you should wait for them to be worth a lot more and come back to them saying "Oh, you remember when you were making fun of me for buying bitcoins? Well now I'm a millionaire because of them."
@_date: 2013-03-31 02:06:12
So did they talk about it at all?

No idea.

No idea.

The thing with any investment of this sort is to never spend more than you are ready to lose. No one can or should tell you what to do with your money. I think that as a 16 year old you're old enough to make your decision.

About the QR code, it's not the same thing since it's a codebar. It's used to access data, not hold it. The only way DNA count make up for their high corruption rate is to have a lot of redundancy or wait until they find a way to make it more reliable.

They can't shut it down, but they can make it illegal and and therefore stop any legitimate business in the US from using them or hosting an exchange. It would still exist outside of the US though.

In all seriousness, I agree that we would either go back to the gold/silver/copper standard. A digital currency wouldn't be of much use with no internet.
