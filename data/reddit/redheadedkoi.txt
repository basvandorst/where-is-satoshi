What is his take on the blocksize debate?
@_date: 2018-08-05 16:05:47
This isn't right. When prices fall, people still buy things. Inflation is when the supply of currency stays the same, and the supply of goods goes down, leading to higher prices. Seigniorage is when the supply of currency goes up and supply of goods stays the same.
Look at technology. My laptop is going to be cheaper next year, but I will still buy a new laptop. Deflation does not keep people from spending money.
When segniorage takes place, then to preserve wealth, people exit the currency for some other investment. There is nothing wrong with the currency being stable, and people investing in the currency to preserve their wealth. This actually gives the currency more utility, hence more value.

Uhh... isnt that exactly what happened?

This is mature advice.

I don't understand how my definition of inflation was incorrect.
One more point to make:
Seigniorage: profit made by a government by issuing currency, especially the difference between the face value of coins and their production costs.
The face value of the coins and their production costs. Such as using less gold to create a coin with a higher face value. Such as adding copper to a gold coin and still recognizing it as having the same value than it otherwise would. Adding copper to a gold coin is a form of taxation - it causes inflation, which removes purchasing power.
inflation is a rise in prices due to a increased demand for goods, or a reduced supply of goods.
seigniorage is a rise in prices due to a government issuing currency that costs less to produce than its price of issue - such as minting copper coins and expecting them to have the value of a gold coin. This is similar to inflation.

Because of its attributes. 
Only one person can hold it at the same time. 
It can be easily transferred to another person. 
It can be easily divided and combined.

Deflation is great - people spend their money when they are comfortable with it. The natural process is that technology makes things cheaper to produce and yet we still buy our computers and cell phones knowing that they will decrease in value over time. But people do buy these things.
Deflation is healthy.

Libra is backed by fiat which will inflate. Bitcoin is digital gold.

Look at how much more money it takes to move the price as it goes higher. Doubling the value of bitcoin was cheap when it was $2 a coin, now doubling the ath to $40k takes a lot more cash.

Why would you ever buy a computer if it is worth less next year?
Deflation is healthy. People do spend money, even when they know that the price will be less later. Look at the way bitcoin works - people spend it! I have.

It is sort of like a password to move bitcoin from your address to a new address.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:46:36
Deflation isnt an enemy. The fed says stable prices. But, the cost of computers (for example) continues to fall. That doesnt stop people from investing in technologies.  Computers continue dropping in price (usd is deflationary here) but people still invest.

These arguments have been made about bitcoin since day 1. You are simply wrong. Just because you dont understand bitcoin doesnt mean it will fail.

Doubling your investment is easier when small volume can easily move the price. Now it takes a ton of cash to move the market.

I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011. The point I am trying to make still stands. Yes, a huge portion of the world could be using Bitcoin in 15 years, and yes, you have made a huge profit.
It is much easier to double your money when an investment is very cheap. Even if Bitcoin goes to $100,000 - which requires a huge amount of cash, you have 10x return. $1 to $10 is the same, but it didn't take a huge amount of money to get there.

Yes, but off-chain solutions, such as lightning, are expected to remedy that.
