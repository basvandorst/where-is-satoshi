They actually emit the same amount of heat as regular incandescent, the advantages are they last much longer and are more durable due to using a brass base, high quality filaments and thicker glass. Basically, these are rough service bulbs. Thanks for pointing that out, this is exactly the kind of feedback i was looking for :)

Yes, rough service bulbs are required to use high quality components as they have to be used in extreme/or sensitive work environments. i.e. Oil Platforms, Automotive Shops etc.

That is a great question. I think there is only one other lighting store that accepts Bitcoins for lights and those are LEDs

I thought it would be a good idea to sell something that everyone needs. Especially with the ban on incandescent bulbs.
 Sure, its not a new TV or a high end Video card,but i think that encourages people to spend their Bitcoins because it is lower risk for both merchant and buyer to make smaller purchases.
