Because banks are [prohibited]( from explaining why accounts are closed if they are closed in accordance with AML regulation.

If you're using something like xbee/zigbee you wouldn't, you could use a hub that assigns addresses each device on the mesh and communicate that way.
If you were going to use a higher power device eg an RPI, you could set up the whole comms stack.
The general idea is a blockchain transaction is a simple and secure communication layer.  You dont needed to expose your home network to a company that might provide a HA service, and for the non technical person, all they have to do is have an internet connection and they can control their home from anywhere. No messy set up or complicated technology getting in the way.  It would be a great consumer experience.

Unfortunately, in Australia, its extremely difficult to open a Bank.  There are 15 banking licences in Australia, the last one (IIRC) is a limited licence owned by Tyro.
Our tier one banks are also beholden to the US banking system.  If a US partner bank of one of our domestic banks says jump, our bank has to say how high, or face being cut off.  
Case in point, Westpac Banking Corp had to close the accounts of ozforex due to (again, IIRC, morgen stanley) saying they didnt like ozforex (an international money remitter) being their customer).
What would be very cool is a bank/building society being set up with a business model that doesnt rely on US clearing... i'd like to see/help that happen.
edit: fidor lost their US link at one stage, i'm not sure if they have one restored.

As i commented before, the RMS is an example of a quasi government entity, a bank in Australia is not.

This is an interesting thought.  If we're looking at communications network, rather than a financial stack this could make sense.
Imagine a home automation system that uses micro transactions to communicate between devices.  you could use your smartphone to make a transaction to an address to change state of a device.
people wouldnt even have to know they're using bitcoin.
