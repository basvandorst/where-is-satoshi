All comments here are the same but the core devs are making the changes. Or the assumption is that now the miners won't accept such change because they want BTC to fail and because they support BCH?

Abused? I was seeing random stray dogs walking into the restaurant kitchens all the time.

Because Asians are more fond of the dangerous street dogs than the tourists that are creating jobs ans that feed them. Not only Indonesians.

Just download something like Coinomi - [ on your phone. It is multicurrency wallet. It will allow you to receive Bitcoin, Ethereum and a few other crypto currencies. When you receive some, you'll also be able to send them. But making usd &lt;-&gt; crypto is a bit difficult if you want to remain anonymous.

BTC transaction are quite cheap recently. Usually &lt; 10 cents. [

Most probably he'll make you download a bitcoin wallet and then he'll suggest that you buy and send some bitcoin in that wallet. Then he'll ask for your private key or for the seed (12-24 words) depending on you wallet so that he can "verify" that you have X amount in the wallet. By giving him the private key or the seed, he will access the funds and steal them. Never ever ever share your private keys or wallet seeds - they are the access to the funds. Like the username+password for you banking account.

I thought I was the only one...

Clearly you haven't understood the idea. Your are not "parting" with your precious coinage. The exchange rate is also irrelevant. Nor you should wait for dips or whatever. You spend BTC now for buying something and you restore the spent amount immediately with Fiat =&gt; you have the same amount of BTC and you have effectively "parted" with Fiat (but sent the merchant BTC so they can also hold). Might want to reread that...

You are right but johoe's UI is a bit too complex for beginners.  
I've made some changes and improved the prediction so now the recommended fees are slightly lower.

I can see the value. But I'm more concerned with the impact we make to the environment (being with cryptocurrencies or whatever) rather than making a device that can change owners. If you want to help someone with crypto just give them a real hardware wallet and tell them how to use it. Some of them are not that expensive. No point in making disposable junk.

Try to send it to Germanу, Canada, USA or Australia in a way that the receiver gets 100% of the value that was sent initially.

Does JPY or EUR have capital gains?
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:04:23


Great, another way to generate trash. Disposable (after 1 time use) hardware wallets. What a piece of sht.

Here’s one even simpler.
Good job though, looks good. :)

I doubt something based on blockchain will be the end game. I'm more confident that something like IOTA might be.

5-6 are definitely NOT enough. Even jochen’s tool suggests 60+ for next block.

Thanks mate, it works! I'll send you some tip when I handle my real stuff. :)
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:43:50
No it doesn’t. Even jochen tool suggests 60+ sat/byte, I don’t know where are you getting the 5 from. Have you tried it?
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:07:25
Here’s your solution 
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:23:02
The code looks legit and it works offline so it might be safe. I needed something similar so I will test and write back. Thank you.
