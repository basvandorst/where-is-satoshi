If you've got a half decent portfolio, which should always include Bitcoin, you shouldn't be down this much.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:10:40
this is just sad
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:22:11
ahaha what shitcoins are you investing in to be down 40% 
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:37:05
let's be honest, it was a gang of youths from Britain. they probably didn't know anything about bitcoin more than creating a wallet
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:05:54
well it isnt wrong
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:47:14
funny how a bitcoin heist takes so much longer than a traditional heist
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:11:22
ironic considering it's faster to ship your private keys than to wait for a transaction on the bitcoin network to confirm 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:29:37
decent altcoins and bitcoin private ty
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:41:36
it's not a picture, it's an archive link:
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:55:37
as much as i hate bitcoin, that was the most autistic thing i've read. thank you 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:06:35
let's not link there thanks
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:42:57
does the same with me, it's weird
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:33:11
only source i could find, and i tried my best by archiving it haha
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:30:40
how long will we be waiting for these channel factories? how long will we be waiting for the lightning network? btc has became some Frankenstein POS that's constantly in 'coming soon' mode, and it's genuinely a shame.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:29:25
wow it's like one merchant bringing down the entire visa network..oh wait that never happens
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:34:31
Only source I could find unfortunately, also this:


DailyMail is just cancer, so I archived it. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:29:56
exactly, we can't afford to rely on waves to progress the market
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:17:30
Hardly progress when you're lagging behind the rest of the industry 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:45:46
For the record, i'm not on team BCH or anything like that.
I've seen lightning network, and I've compared it to some of the altcoin offerings that offer instantaneous, no fee payment straight out of the box, with no need for this channel shit, and I'm largely puzzled that a large part of this community is convinced that one day, a switch will be flipped and all payments will be taken over the LN. 
However, it will be interesting to see the adoption of the LN over time. I'm hoping it will be successful, since BTC drives this entire market, for better or for worse. What I don't want to see is LN being launched, and then we run into more issues that are going to be fixed 'in the future'. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:07:01
if you're relying on waves of people to come from a specific event, you're in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:18:26
Highly unlikely you'll find any, and the cost and effort to sell the HDD's on afterwards would probably take up a lot of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:18:17
haha yep let me know when that end comes
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:53:01
The tech you speak of is severely outdated, crypto is sticking around, bitcoin and its many forks are not.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:57:55
ouch, hoping it was a recent sale 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:15:56
i mean that would totally work with all the fees involved 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:29:48
yeah im sure people will be ecstatic to pay $15 in fees for a haircut
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:42:39
if it was me, i wouldn't accept bitcoin. nobody is gonna use it, bitcoin is only good for making money. look into ethereum, litecoin, even some of the new contenders that don't charge fees for transactions. These are the ones that will succeed as a genuine payment method, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:30
how ignorant, XRP, XRB, IOTA, etc.
edit: Even Bitcoin Cash is better and that's a major shitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:11:35
well the real question is did you sell the BTC after
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:24:05
how ignorant can you be lol, keep paying your ridiculous fees and [fucking up the environment]( 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:54:09
there's no guarantee with any of this
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:21:02
wouldn't worry too much man, looks like its gonna keep making you money, it just doesn't have much use outside of that
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:39:20
that's what some of the new altcoins are setting out to solve, because the fees and speed associated with merchants accepting bitcoin, which is its actual purpose as a currency, are very high and very slow.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:19:57
I invested in December, not necessarily just bitcoin and I'm doing fine. Not everyone fell for the Hodl meme
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:00:15
i wouldn't go that far, but they are definitely centralising bitcoin in the form of lightning network 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:10:01
Thank you to our brave bag hodlers in blue who allowed the big boys to unload at 20 thru 10k. your service will not be forgotten.

큰 소년들이 20 시부 터 10 시까 지 언로 드할 수있게 해주는 청색의 용감한 가방 hodlers에게 감사드립니다. 당신의 서비스는 잊혀지지 않을 것입니다.
Thanks burgers
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:17:16
no reason, I agree with you fully. I believe Bitcoin is still massively overvalued in its current state
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:50:49
this is good for bitcoin!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:35:41
you're doing fellow bag holders an honour catching the falling knife, thanks OP
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:43:06
if you're not worried about having lost 70% of your portfolio's value in a few months, you're fucked
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:02:32
so brave
