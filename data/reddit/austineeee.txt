Stockman is speaking tonight at the botcoin center in NYC!

Stockman announced that he will be introducing a bill into the US Congress in january so that congress will leave bitcoin alone, like congress did to the internet. I was at the event and the scale of the announcement seemed pretty serious to me.

I love kraken. As a trader I feel more comfortable with them (in terms of security) than any other exchange. 
I've also personally met the leadership of Kraken and they seem to be very focused on compliance and anti fraud.
The KYC is very reasonable and the fees are tiny. 
I've used many other exchanges both in usa and Eur and kraken is honestly my favorite. I just hope they expand to usa soon.
Hope this helps😄

They still have  3000$ of mine. That is not whole. I have accounts at a number of exchanges. If I would have had the slightest inclination that coinbase was risky I would have purchased coins elsewhere. My past experience with coinbase was positive. They have my money. They have provided no service.

Confident political advocate who runs a company taking bitcoin and makes a living supporting libertarian propaganda! Sounds like a kind of guy.

Coinbase is now offically more risk than reward when it comes to using their services. I used to promote them to EVERYONE as the easiest on ramp to bitcoin buying. Now i would never. They ripped me off, they ripped a friend off (and neither of us are by any means bitcoin amateurs or new customers) and the stories of them ripping off other redditors seem endless.

I have been recommending coinbase to friends for months and i fear i may no longer be able to do so shortly. Prior to November I had made 5 completed purchases with coinbase. I was never flagged "high-risk" at this time.
 This month I made purchases which added up to over 20 btc. Because my purchases were pending with coinbase I was unable to make a purchase in an exchange or on localbitcoins. I didnt foresee this to be a problem because of my past positive experences with coinbase. 
As of today however all of my transactions for the month of November have been cancelled. Today i received what seemed like a generic form letter from craig at coinbase which mentioned nothing about honoring the terms of the transaction. 
I attended Mondays satoshi square in NYC and when I brought up what was happening with coinbase everyone seemed very disappointed. Everyone wants coinbase to succeed and this "high-risk" scandel threatens to damage coinbase's reputation and the reputation of bitcoin in general. I spend a great deal of time trying to assure people of the safety of bitcoin. This doesnt help.  
I desperatly hope coinbase can resolve this soon, not just for me but for the future of bitcoin. Coinbase's ease of use is the reason i recommend it to so many friends and family members. It is also the reason I often use it myself. I sure hope this gets handled. As the price continues to rise i'm having a hard time shaking the feeling that I have been wronged.

I was at the Christmas party put on by this group and it was awesome. Everyone is met was incredibly interesting. 
Bitcoin is literally coming to Wall Street. It looks like New York is become the center of the bitcoin universe.

I just got back from a month long trip to venezuela. In that time the exchange rate from usd to bolivar went from 40/1 to 54/1! In 30 days! I introduced bitcoin to a couple friends down there but it is hard to find sellers willing to accept bolivars. It seems like a lot of smart people are preparing to leave the country as things don't appear to be getting better anytime soon. 
I agree that bitcoin cannot solve Venezuelans problems by itself. It can help a lot of people though.

Coinbase screw me too out of 23 coins. They lend credence to the idea that bitcoin is a scam.

I had made 5 previous successful transactions in august. I liked working with coinbase because of the ease of use. I was out of the country for a bout a month and was unable to make any purchases.
I purchased aprx. 23 btc from coinbase over 9 purchases from nov 6 to nov 11. They flagged all the transactions as high risk in order from latest to earliest. All told i'm out over 5000$ in gains.
I have written over 12 emails starting immediately after the first flagged transaction. To make it even worse coinbase still has over 3000$ of my money.
I also commonly sell Bitcoin to family and friends which I have been unable to do because of all this. The opportunity cost to all of this is for me is huge!
I used to be one of coinbase's biggest fans. Even immediately after this happened I was confident they would make it right. Now over a week from when this whole thing began, still waiting for any type of reply, I can no longer deny reality.
Coinbase might not be scammers, however with the way they are operating they may as well be. This gives Bitcoin a horrible name.

I just came back from ven. and tried to trade btc. It proved very difficult. I spoke to a few people who were planning some projects centered around bitcoin. hopefully they can get them off the ground before the country completely falls apart.

Ya coinbase is great. Unless you're one of the ones they rip off. The did me dirty, I made many attempts to reach out to them through many different venues and I have yet to hear so much as a sorry. Not what I expected after my initial positive experiences with them.
