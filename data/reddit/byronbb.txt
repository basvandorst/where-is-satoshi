It would be usable anywhere. Not just wal-mart. Who said they need decentralised or trust less? Who cares? Obviously this is pie in the the sky speculative thinking, but I think, as I pointed out, the only real feasible and useful alt-coin to ever consider. People trust the huge technology firms more than the government and I don't think that's off base. No the coin would trade in relation to its stock price, so it's not a coupon. So there you have it SkidmarkSteve, I walked you though it[.](

I feel a real alt coin would be a giant like Wal-mart or a group of giants, Apple, Google, FB, Amazon, backing a coin with stock equity.  Bitcoin may literally become the crypto-gold.

All that is required is time and the inevitable conditioning of the population. Could paper money ever have been successful if it was not originally backed by the "promise" or gold or silver? Of course not. Everyone would have laughed. All that was required was a hundred years or so and they said: "Wait a minute, everyone now simply takes the *paper* as having value, and not all this gold we have backing it. So lets just sell all the gold and print as much money as we want because they have now been sufficiently fooled."

A bitcoin loan would be like any hard-money loan. If you get a fiat loan against some gold you own, you only receive about half the value of the gold. A loan against real estate usually garners 65%-75% of its value.

No. This discount is being offered by the people BUYING the coins from Newegg.

There was a interesting theory than chinese miners are running farms as a means to move yuan to bitcoin to sell offshore to usd and escape capital flow controls from china.

There is the possibility that committed industrial miners whose breakeven price is breached, will turn off their miners and start buying coins on the open market.

People are often afraid of new technology that upsets the norm.

It's a misnomer to think people will think like you and me.  How many people will accept fiat money has no value and it's purpose is to steal their wealth through devaluation? Accepting this means their entire lives and goals for money is just part of a larger shell game. So even if they understand they won't want to admit it because it's part of their psyche. Either bitcoin succeeds or fails because it is superior, no amount of flag waving is going to convince anyone of anything. If you want to promote bitcoin then accept it for a service or buy things with it.

I've been thinking there is a market for exporter's from SA nations to accept bitcoin who can then sell the coins internally for USD. Many of these nations force their citizens to transact in the nation's fiat which they'd rather not do. The banking system prevents them from skirting this rule but bitcoin might be a good solution to get around things. Argentina doesn't even allow it's own citizens to own physical gold, which seems pretty shocking to me.

Open source software is hard to put backdoors into. The NSA can exploit windows because they visit Microsoft and tell them "let us see the code". Then the NSA wizards find a bug in the code and write an exploit based on this bug that is not at all public.

?? if you can trade bitcoin for cad now why wont you trade bitcoin for fita-cad in the future? If you mean "outlaw" bitcoin this is not in their best interest. The USD is the most powerful because it is "the best" within a pseudo free market. It's value is that it is in competition with other currencies and gold. Draconian measures by a state would imply THEY think bitcoin is better, and this would actual injure their fiat because currency valuation is largely perceptual. In the end of the day IT IS PAPER.

They cannot do this openly actually. Since their money's value rests on mere psychological opinion that it is sound, to attack bitcoin is to suggest they think their own money is not sound, thus causing devaluation. Of course they could do this secretly but then they'd become the obvious perpetrator which would make it even worse: they'd be playing their hand face up that they've lost confidence in their own money.

"Overthrow the govt" is far too severe imo. "Create a money not issued by a government" is far more reasonable. When governments fail the people who run them escape in their helicopters and the rest run for their lives. Bitcoin is DECENTRALIZED, the concept is decentralization, not TAKING OVER so a new set of idiots can be in charge. See Jihan Wu and Roger Ver et al.

what is this from?
@_date: 2015-07-13 06:02:48
I was thinking a broker could facilitate the payment in bitcoin for exports from countries like greece, argentina etc. It would not require that the import-export parties were interested in bitcoin per say. An exporter wants fiat. The importer gives the broker the cash and he buys and then sends bitcoin to Argentina for sale in country to pay the exporter. No cash actually moves over borders. Because Argentina will pay a higher price for bitcoin there might be wiggle room for the broker to profit on a type of arbitrage. Currently a BTC sells for 4000 ARS or $436USD in Argentina.
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:43:58

No, this is computationally unproductive. A vanity address request is something like 1redditxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.

Its amazing how you are an expert on the hardware wallets but dont even know how it works. The wallet requires the user to physically press a button on the device to send bitcoins. Therefore even if your computer is owned remotely an attacker cannot steal the coins from the wallet. Yes you have to trust that satoshi labs is secure with their firmware updates but they have been in this community for a long time and they themselves are likely not scammers considering everyone knows who they are and are positioned to be one of the top bitcoin companies going forward. But that all said if you have large amounts of coin to hold then yes I think a paper wallet is better. However a HW wallet is the most secure way to routinely receive and send bitcoin at the moment.

Either you trust the bitcoin core dev team or you dont. If you dont then you side with BCH or whatever side chain alt-coin that exists that is "better" than what the core dev team thinks is the correct solution. Dont bother trying to understand it from the technical angle, the people working on the code do that. As long as you trust them to be promoting the fundamental elements of bitcoin, namely decentralization, then BTC is the best solution. Since the start of these forks bitcoin has been zooming up in value. Why? Is it because its a huge conspiracy or is it because the big money is betting on BTC?

This is all over my head, but perhaps altcoins (ie Litecoin and maybe some more I don't know about), could be used instead of bitcoin for micro transactions. While I have never been a proponent of alt-coins, (which are often out-right scams/ get rich schemes for the creators), perhaps they will serve a utility. If bitcoin became saturated with tx and the fees became "prohibitive" compared to alternatives, then logically people would begin to use another blockchain with lower fees/faster tx times etc.

Article aside, there was definitely a price spike with the ASIC miners being delivered. One thing he fails to mention is that the increased hash rate increases network security and by proxy makes the coins more valuable. Another concept I considered was when ASIC was delivered, miners who owned them had a veritable printing press, their ROI was insane. For those without an ASIC miner, the only way to acquire coins was to buy. Since there ARE actually a finite supply, these ASIC miners were acquiring coins "on the cheap", and if they were willing to sell at market buyers were happy to take them.

Yes money is the root of all the problems. Or the problems are born of the money creation mechanism. The thing is it's very hard for people to understand this because they do not want it to be true. When you are a child you are conditioned to believe that the coins your mom has has *intrinsic* value, not relative value. You learn that those coins can get you candy from the machine and an association between money and a sweet taste is created. I really think this is the primal mechanism of why people do not want to think their money is really just printed pieces of worthless paper because it's imprinted into their psyche at an early age and associated with a pleasurable, desirous experience. 
Another way to consider it is to look at the USD from the beginning to the end of the gold standard. Would the dollar have had any legitimacy from the start if it was not "backed by gold"? No, everyone would have laughed. Then as enough time passed people become conditioned to associate the paper as valuable, (since they never see the gold), and so the government comes along and removes the gold backing because the population has been sufficiently convinced it's not actually a part of the equation. This is the greatest con in the history of humanity.

You tell businesses you will buy bitcoin any time at a certain rate, say 1% less than "market" (not a bad price), and then you being a smart trader, take those coins and profit more than you paid for them.

Actually you don't. The reason people don't gamble on chess is because the worse player will never win and gamblers need to win to continue to gamble. A slot machine that never paid out would not be played by anyone. Even by "imbecile" gamblers.
For a gambling FPS scenario to be successful the n00b would have to have a chance at winning. An entire game would need to be created around this concept. You cannot just take an off-the-shelf game and make it into a betting game, you need to build a betting game.
One way to do this say in a FPS, free-for-all type game, is complex but possible. Say you kill an opponent, you are credited with 1 unit and they lose 1 unit. However because you have killed someone, somone who kills you obtains (lets say) 1.25 units, and you lose 1.25 units. The higher your kill death ratio the more you are "worth". This would create a dynamic where the good players would have an incentive to kill each other, not just the weak players. You could also incrementally handicap the good player as their KD ratio increases, slow them down, give them less ammo, less health etc.

As more and more coins are moved around, will they invariably become more and more fractured and require a higher tx fee to transfer them? Like a hard drive that gets more and more fragmented as time goes on.

The simplest way is to sell vouchers in a machine for a set face value in USD. You buy a card just like out of a phone card machine. The card has a phone number on it or code for the website. When the code is redeemed coins are transferred to the address on the card for the current usd value.

I would be terrified if I had an ASIC pre-order for a ton of money like the big players do. Scam potential aside, ASIC is a pretty huge risk. You have to be fully confident in bitcoin going forward to invest in ASIC. They are useless outside of bitcoin mining, whereas with GPU and FGPAs some sunk cost can be recovered after the are no longer profitable to mine with. So to be an ASIC owner one really needs to be bullish bitcoin, and if one is bullish bitcoin then perhaps simply buying bitcoin is a better move.

I'd be terrified of owning a large box like this, the risk of it going up in smoke too scary. I'd lean towards multiple miners from multiple companies.

Bitcoin gambling offers the LOWEST margins in the world with provably fair games with instant deposit and withdraw. This is something the traditional sites CANNOT compete with. I expect gambling margins to continue to drop as bitcoin grows. Hopefully peer to peer gaming can be developed and costs will drop to fractions of a percent above the transaction fees.

You can sell them locally. You are in a good position to become the "bitcoin exchanger" in the city where you live, assuming it is large enough. When you have sold some for Euros you can buy more on the exchange and simply earn small profits by selling at a premium locally then buying at market price on MtGox.

All governments seek more power. The 20th century saw varied attempts towards this goal and "totalitarianism" lost because it was too overtly coercive. American politics is divided across imaginary "differences" between voters. The government works perfectly for itself when the population is induced to believe there is an enemy it must combat in the "other". I do not mean to imply their is a great conspiracy either, the politicians are part of the same machine.

No bank would ever cede power over a currency they minted to a p2p network. Otherwise what we are talking about is a bank issuing it's own e-credit which the US government has gone to great lengths to quash in e-gold and Liberty dollars.

I tried to sim this in excel. AmIdoingitwrong? because it seems the site should show profits in excess of what it has garnered. I mean to run at 0.17% hold with a 1% edge over 1.25million wagered seems insane unlucky. What I did was just generate a random number in a cell and if that cell was over .49 then the bankroll goes up 100 otherwise it goes down 100. This gives a win 51% of the time. Even with 10k trials run 100 times I saw it was in the red only twice.
