Has there been an assertion that the only requirement to create a totally secure Bitcoin environment was the failure of Gox? Gox highlighted some issues and created a demand for greater accountability and security but it's not achievable overnight. On the other side, if BTCe suddenly turns off the lights and peoples' coins are gone, they will lose only what they choose to gamble with. The risk is apparent to everyone and anyone who refuses to see it is in danger of repeating history. 
Everyone should have learned that they are responsible for their coins. There are secure options available. If I find them to be too inconvenient, then I take a chance, but it's on me. Better options are becoming available but there's no switch to flip. The environment we see today isn't the final product.

I have no problem with asking for evidence and sources. Good policy. However, it does not follow that an assertion made by someone without evidence is automatically false, it only means that that person is not an authority and that you should be researching the point elsewhere.

Maybe there really are a lot of people who pay close attention when government entities warn about risks but it's hard for me to see the point. Who is the person that might plop down all of his disposable income without realizing that, "First and foremost, if you can’t afford to lose the money you have, you should not buy bitcoins"? I think the assumption should be that people who go to the trouble of setting up a wallet and purchasing Bitcoin are likely to have done at least some research and already have a basic understanding of the risks.

I haven't read every comment but the overall sentiment here seems to be that BitPay had the right to make the decision they made. People just dislike it. There is nothing hypocritical about believing that a business has a right to make these kinds of choices while, at the same time, disliking the choices they make.

The personal data was stolen as a result of regulation. It was on the Gox servers because they attempted to comply with AML regulations.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:19:40
It may be as good a solution as any. However, I will point out that for the most part, even the people who lost coins in Gox agree that having assets inside the exchange, in light of what was known by the end times, was a very bad decision. It seems to me that this plan gives the greatest amount of control and decision making authority to the people who have already shown the poorest judgement. The more you left inside in spite of the evidence, the higher your rank.

You're certainly entitled to that opinion, however it doesn't alter my assertion that a government guarantee of value isn't worth much when it takes about $24 to buy what a dollar would buy 100 years ago.

While what she says is true, I'm not sure it matters. If this involves a large cash purchase, she says $30,000 I think, I don't think the defense will work. As I understand it, any cash transaction involving $10,000 or more requires a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) to be filed with the Treasury Department. Even though this involves state regulation rather than federal, I'm sure that the issue will be the amount of USD cash involved rather than the asset that was purchased.

It's interesting to me that people have such confidence in the Fed and the dollar. Considering that when Germany's Bundesbank in 2012, asked for the return their 300 tons of gold deposited with the Fed, they were told that it would be seven years before it could be returned. That's a very Gox-like response.

Everyone is guessing. I bought a little on the dip last night and transferred it to my own wallet and I intend to leave it there no matter what happens. Most everyone was expecting the Gox failure and the anticipation drove the price down pretty severely. There are some variables to consider. 1) The speculation is that a large amount of BTC was stolen from GOX. Has it already been sold on other exchanges? Will it be dumped all at once somewhere? Will it be sold slowly over the coming months? No one knows. 2) Has the news already been fully priced into the market or will the bottom fall out later? 
You do, of course need to understand that BTC is a risky place to put your (dad's) money but I think it has potential. I expected some kind of Gox failure for a while (Not a tremendous insight on my part. Most everyone did) but I was a little surprised at the apparent magnitude of the failure. It appears that there's nothing at all left and that people who had assets there will lose it all. Given that, I was surprised that BTC didn't plunge further last night. However, there's no reason to think that there may not be some big BTC holders that are going to play the bounce and sell off when they believe the price won't go higher. Maybe that will create a panic and the bottom will fall out. 
On the other hand, there is positive news. At least positive in terms of BTC becoming more mainstream, which some rebellious types might argue is bad news. There are indications that a regulated US BTC market may be created this summer for wealthy investors and banks. If that occurs and if it is successful, I think that the sky's the limit. 
In the end, Badhanna has it right. Your decision is going to impact you, not me, so it's all on you.

It's hard to imagine that Bitcoin will replace currently circulated currencies (though central banks may inflate to the point that I'm proven wrong) but I think it has a lot of potential. Many of the criticisms that people make seem to assume that Bitcoin is already what it will be. The security issues that you bring up for example, are real but I doubt that they are permanent. I think that very secure ways of handling Bitcoin can and will be developed.

What you may be talking about is Gresham's Law which is most commonly stated as "bad money drives out good." Essentially, it means that someone holding money that will be worth less tomorrow and money that will be worth the same or more tomorrow will spend the money that will be worth less and keep that which will be worth more. I think that likely only comes into play if there's a true competition between Bitcoin and fiat currencies and I think they only compete as currencies if central banks allow inflation to get out of control. 
My feeling is that Bitcoin may survive but that people will exchange in and out of Bitcoin when it serves a particular purpose such as money transfers or Internet purchases. I think it won't generally be used as a currency. That doesn't mean that it won't appreciate in value, but only that the appreciation won't affect users to any great extent. If they buy  it for a specific transaction and the person on the other end generally exchanges it immediately for fiat, then the exchange rate for, say dollars, is not too important. If I'm going to do a $100 transfer to my cousin in Florida (assuming that he can deal in Bitcoin without being arrested), I buy $100 worth of Bitcoin, send it, and he cashes out on the other end it doesn't much matter if $100 buys 3 mBTC or 3 BTC so long as I buy it, send it immediately and he cashes out on the other end.

If the volatility is a permanent feature of BTC, you have a point.  The money coming into Bitcoin currently, represents bets on the future adoption of the technology. I think that it's too early to worry too much about volatility as a destructive force.

Life is full of risks. I choose the risks I'm willing to accept and you choose yours. I don't understand the idea that if you choose to accept a high level of risk, I should cover your losses.  Sorry for your loss but opportunities with possibilities of high rewards entail a high level of risk. You don't get the reward unless you accept the risk. I doubt that you'd be willing to share your millions with me if your bet paid off, don't try to shift your loss to me.

What is the justification for equating Gox with an FDIC insured bank? There is no reason to have similar expectations of "security" and the Bitcoin community has never asserted that turning control of your assets over to a third party is necessarily secure. Bitcoin is evolving. It may be true that features will outpace security in the early going but the only claim made by the Bitcoin community is that as it matures, demand for security will increase and that this demand will be met with more secure systems as developers compete. 
Even in a world without Bitcoin, our assets are not secure. If we trust the wrong people, we may lose our stuff.

That said, all of the people who lost a lot of coins demonstrated themselves to be smarter than me by virtue of the fact that I have managed to accumulate on a tiny amount of BTC and they had far more, so don't overvalue my analysis.

The value would increase if it were commonly and universally used. That doesn't mean that anyone would have to pay more to use it. It just means that prices might be expressed in mBTC and progressively smaller units as it became more and more popular. The odds are probably long though.

You are correct that the people who claim that Bitcoin is set to skyrocket but offer no reason are simply hoping blindly. It may collapse into nothing. However, there are reasons to believe that its value will increase. Someone else mentioned the Second Market exchange that they claim will open this summer. If it does open, and if it is successful it will be a signal that Bitcoin is taken seriously as payment system and that there is a great deal of capital dedicated to the end of seeing it become so. 
There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will increase in value or even that it will survive. It is however, a technology that addresses a need. It's speculative at this point and people shouldn't buy the hype that if you own it, you're going to get rich. It has potential but don't bet the rent money.

Why do you have a lot of money there, then? I used them for a long time but the fact that I don't know who or where they are bothered me and I moved out. However, I should say that Gox showed signs of dishonesty and incompetence for a long time. I've never seen that at BTC-e.

Is it your contention that the Bitcoin environment is fully developed and that what we have right now is all that we can ever expect?

Well, almost 10% of US households are unbanked meaning they have no debit cards, credit cards, or checks. Though I don't think that the unbanked are the only US population that can benefit. Someone else mentioned inflation. An argument against Bitcoin as a currency is that it is deflationary because of its strictly limited supply (I'm skeptical about claims that Bitcoin will replace existing fiat currencies unless central banks attempt to over-inflate, which they have a tendency to do from time to time). A lot of retired people would greatly appreciate this feature though because it prevents their savings from being eroded by inflation.

I'm not entirely clear on what regulations you want. I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that in every country in the world, theft of money and property is illegal. Fraud is illegal. Negligence is certainly actionable as a civil matter and may also be outright criminal. What happened to people who had assets locked up in GOX was horrible, but what happened in 2008 in the regulated financial markets was horrible. BTC offers people possibilities of huge returns. Those kinds of reward opportunities never exist without great risk. If you jump in the deep end of the pool, you should be willing to swim because even if there's a lifeguard, you're taking a risk.

No argument here. As I said, it's currently a risk you choose to take. If you do well trading, maybe you can make it worthwhile by moving profits to a paper wallet. If you maintain large balances with third parties, you may lose it all. My point though, is that it isn't something that is going to be resolved immediately but I think that solutions will evolve. The Gox failure was educational but it wasn't an event that could transform the overall environment overnight. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:47:21
Yes, but my point is that the personal information would not have been in Gox's possession except for regulations that required it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:26:22
Of course they are all speculation at this point. There hasn't been a statement from Gox that contained any real information for months. You're asking people to support them when they refuse to even tell us their side of the story. There is nothing for people on the outside to do but speculate. What we do know with certainty is that a lot of people (at least for the time being, but most probably forever) have lost a lot of money as a result of something that happened inside Gox. Try to put a halo on Mark Karpeles if you want but he violated the trust of a lot of people. Maybe (I can't imagine the scenario) he can win it back, but he hasn't even tried.

I appreciate this. There seems to be a great deal of hand wringing and arm flailing because (OMG!) there's a relatively anonymous payment system that can potentially be used for illegal activities. Dollar bills have always had the same feature. "Someone might do something with this that we don't want them to do," is a pretty sorry argument.

The plan, at the time it was created was little more than grasping at straws. At this point people know that they don't have the coins and a key component of the plan is to "Bet on future profit to refill the lost coins." I don't know about you, but they're not going to have any future profit from me. I left GOX about a year ago, though yesterday I did lose 86¢ (USD) that was left in my account. I won't file a claim. They can use that to help replace the coins they lost.
