Also the address that’s usually in the front of the hologram is gone or rubbed off. The address begins with 1Jamn which doesn’t show up in the casascius search. I can’t find any demo coins that are 25btc in my search so I’m kinda confused what the hell I have here. So hopefully someone here will have an idea

Yes I looked up the address using the private key. The address has never had Btc transacted at any time in that address, and has always been zero btc. Which leads me to think it’s a demo coin. And to the other guy no I didn’t get scammed lol I didn’t pay for a funded coin. I bought it knowing it had no balance. I thought that it was redeemed at some point but never thought it never had funds on it in its history

I actually have two coins only one with a hologram tho. [my two coins](

Well that wasn’t the bottom so don’t worry. We will likely test the 200 MA at around 3160 price but it may cut lower to 2960. So don’t fomo back in just wait. People are calling bottom and capitulation hasn’t even hit yet. When you see the biggest sell volume on a chart that’s the bottom.

I hope you listened and didn’t buy back higher
