The technology that drives it is really cool, but yeah Bitcoin itself is only as valuable as the market dictates, it has no intrinsic value whatsoever. It's not like stocks because those give dividends, which drives how much each stock should be worth. It's not like gold, because gold has a use outside of a store of value and 1000's of years of being established.   
  
Personally I don't see how Bitcoin has a future, but because of my lack of vision I have never made any money off of it, so I really know nothing. It's too risky for me personally, and I've been watching it for a few years.

Trying a mobile camera upload. I can get to the point of taking the pictures and adding them on the web page, but it just fails every time I confirm.

You too u/NosillaWilla! I won't try and pretend that I can even fathom what it's like, so I'll just say thank you for doing a job that takes over your life for the benefit of others. Hope your holidays are reasonably stress free.

It would still be good financial advice.

Don't beat yourself up about hindsight. If no-one had ever spent any BTC then it would never be where it is now.  
  
It easily could have gone the other way and you'd be in poverty now because you bet all your money on a speculative investment. Sometimes they work out, sometimes they don't.
