new to crypto-currency, dont really have any idea on where to start, i just know that i want to start investing/buying for the future. I have read the faq post but i am still a bit confused and understand ill have to do a bit more research. 
my first question is how do buying Bitcoins work and how do i even start? I made an account on coinbase an entire bitcoin is $2000+ so how are people able to buy 10$ worth? are they buying a portion of a bitcoin until ultimately they have a whole one?

one more question...
how do people who invest 10$-100$ make a profit off of bitcoin when they arent purchasing a full coin?

I am also new to cryptocurrency and do not really have any knowledge on the technical side of of everything.....but I just installed Electrum and i understand i have to buy the bitcoin on an exchange and then transfer it to my wallet. how does using electrum and buying off of an exchange differ from buying and storing my bitcoin on coinbase?

this is something i was wondering...
I've heard about bitcoin a few years ago and just never had the brainpower to learn about it. Now here am i with bitcoin at an all time high and I'm just wondering is there a "to late to the party" aspect. i want to invest but i just hope I'm not toooo late..
Edit: spelling

im also looking to invest and a lot of people are saying to do it in increments so thats what ill probably do. im just wondering what low amount is significant enough to make a an impact... $10? $50? $100? etc..
