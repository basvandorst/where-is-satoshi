Satoshi nakamoto has almost 1m coins that have never been moved... If deceased they never will
There's a website dedicated to estimating the amount destroyed frozen or lost [I'm sure someone who is a karma whore will post it soon enough] 
As to your question... if.you had a car and the car company only made 21 million of that exact car.... And over time people crashed theirs or took it to the grave it would mean less cars
Less cars = more value

Imagine if 1 football team is bitcoin and the other football team is B cash
But anytime you see an account praising b cash just view the account comments and posts.... if it has several thousand karma and dates back a few years but only recently has been posting about b cash and bitcoin then it's a fake

Capital gains is 20 percent on anything over 400k if you single

If you send your BTC there you get 50% of it returned to you.

For every 0.01 BTC sent you feed a frat star 3 square meals

 Looks a lot.like a genesis atm with a coinsource brand on it
One on far west side of Cleveland that was selling 1 bitcoin for 500 USD MORE than coinbase price
Also charges about 10% coming and going 
Only reason to use would be to launder marked bills... but people still pay regular atm fees to withdraw $20 USD

Can't just plug In atms and charge $500 xtra on top of a coinbase Bitcoin plus 10% coming and going... without paying the mafia...err the local government 
Need to grease the city planner, the mayor, building and zoning, safety director etc;  also don't forget to set up an LLC and to renew your license every 12 months 
He could have set up a business with the city as a "bitcoin broker" and slapped a banner on a vacant store front and would have been fine... as long as the city gets their cut
