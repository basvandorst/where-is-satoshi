Yeah, now you understand why BCH started with bigger blocks instead of down payments. It wasn't something they wanted to do, but it kept bitcoin true to its roots
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:07:52
Agreed, however in the short term it was a decent solution. Now we've got bitcoin segwit, and bitcoin lightning, and who knows what's next
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:33:58
Bitcoin Segwit+Lightning fork FTW!  Big FU to the old BCH fans, LOL.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:52:46
As opposed to Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Lightning?

Reported for being a shill
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:37:35
Agreed, pretty much about 79.348% of Bitcoin total value was essentially given away, so when you calcumlate like that percentage against 1 millers you end up with %99 value rate, which was totally not cool.
BUT the best thing is that it was FUD and it's all going to be okay because wow.

Bitcoin fork
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:46:10
I imagine its real value is between 600 and 1200, but I base that on it having the usefulness that it should've had as a currency. Then came the infighting, the high fees, and finally a consensus that "it's not a currency, it's a store of value"
Now there are better crypto currencies available that actually function as currency, I don't see any value left in bitcoin. Good riddance.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:50:09
I understand this, hence my clarification

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:43:54
"Full mainstream" was when it hit $700 and many places would accept it as payment.  Now it's just a circus attraction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:55:46
He just explained to you why this is a bad mentality and here you go with it again. Any cryptocurrency that has a limited quantity can be a "store of value", if it can also be used as a currency or has a benefit such as being more anonymous then why use bitcoin in the first place?
Go ahead, keep the goal of a crippled bitcoin and watch how quickly this house of cards collapses.

Asking how Bitcoin can be used in the cloud of "ITS A STORE OF VALUE", "ITS A CURRENCY AFTER LIGHTNING NETWORK", "STEAM STOPS ACCEPTING BITCOIN".  If you treat everyone who's confused (and rightly so as the goalposts keep moving) with hostility then you're not helping bitcoin at all, it's a stupid mentality, and sorry that you're getting bitched at about it despite being far from the only one participating in it.

@_date: 2017-02-01 21:35:27
I don't suggest OP try this.  I've spent the past 3 fucking hours trying to get CPFP to work because I accidentally opened an old version of Electrum that used a smaller fee.
The clients that support CPFP are a fucking pain in the dick on importing your keys which, yes, I know is insecure, but I'll gladly throw the wallet away if I could just fucking get these transactions through.  I'm pretty frustrated at the moment.
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:53:55
No. The idiots who want it unstable are the same morons who called bitcoin a store of value for 6 months.
People who actually wanted to use it as currency want it stable.

@_date: 2017-11-28 12:40:33
Calling it gold is exactly why people question the usefulness. When fees are low and transactions are quick then people call it currency, but when the opposite happens people call it a store of value. It's moving the goalposts every time
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:59:46
Depends on the day, and the amount.

Unless Bitcoin is rendered valueless due to a quantum computer breakthrough, which could really happen any day now.  Don't hodl too long boys.

@_date: 2017-11-25 19:43:11
That's fine and all, and I hope bitcoin continues to be usable, but can the fuckheads who tout "bitcoin is a store of value" shut the fuck up next time and stop moving the goalposts?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:52:47
Because every time it stops working well as a currency people quickly say "It's not a currency".

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:55
Um, yes there is a limit to gold (at least on earth), that's why it's so valuable. It's not artificially limited, and on top of that it's useful.  It's malleable, scarce, doesn't oxidize or corrode under normal conditions, and is an amazing conductor.  All the gold ever mined would fit inside a 60ft^3 area. That's tiny, it's nothing.  Its scarcity and usefulness is beyond question.

Which ones? BCH?  Should BTC abandon the plans for the lightning network then since it's not supposed to be spent?

The tech is bad to begin with. If bitcoin gets popular then you have unusable wait times for confirmation, or have to use bitcoin gift cards (lightning network).
If bitcoin is dead then confirmations are quick, but is dead.

They don't though, if Bitcoin became popular again it would be just as unusable... good luck buying coffee with it when the confirmations take hours.

My Coinbase account got banned for some reason so I've not been able to do shit since.  Cex doesn't work in my state, Coinmama won't just fails without saying why. I live near no major banks so my option on LBC usually involve some combination of MoneyGram and photos of receipts. I guess eventually I'll jump through all the numerous hoops, but for now I'll just sit on what I have.

Seems pretty stupid.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:49:40
Lightning? Meaning... Bitcoin Gift Card?  All lightning does is tie up your bitcoin before you even spend it, just to keep congestion down. It's shit tech in real life, but kudos to it for being a trailblazer.  It will always have some value due to sentiments.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:52:45
You have to find the vendor, make sure they are on LN (not a given), then you have to know you're going to spend money ahead of time and decide how much to put on there, and you'd have to do it hours or days ahead if there is a lot of congestion like peak Bitcoin usage.
Fucking stupid.
