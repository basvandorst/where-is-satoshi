Because nobody objects. Nobody says no. Many govts want to be allied with America for financial reasons and one of they key requirements is that American security services can practically lift anyone from anywhere when they so wish. If you are fleeing the law, stay away from any country allied with America and has taken American money.

Canada would, had the guy been facing the death penalty, but that's not the case, though, Thailand would ship anyone out death penalty not withstanding. 
For Thailand, being close to the US is more important than being close to China, and China does not catch feelings about allegiances, except for the Dalai Lama and a very few select individuals. Provided you pay your China bill, and keep buying China, you can be in bed with practically anyone. US influences Thailand far greater than China does.

Sad. New ICT Cabinet Secretary has invested in Bitpesa. Though this was before he joined government. And he couldn't even argue it out. Anything to keep M-Pesa rolling.

Board member? Damn. Had no clue. In that case....

That seems to be the going rate. Asked two other companies I know, and they charge around the same prices.

I have a money guy who understands the nature of our symbiotic relationship. He makes quite a bit of money off me, but he never fails and keeps his nose clean. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:37:18
Huh??? I'm trying to learn more about Bitcoin not troll. Life is far too short to troll.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:12:11
Like everyone else.

Relatively trivial or easy? After realising that some Chinese banks only do Visa/Mastercard in urban popular areas and drop the ball in rural areas, I wouldn't mind getting a Unionpay based account.

Will check there. Had no idea that existed. Sorry, I'm new to the scene.

I am a retailer. I buy stuff from Country B. I want to send money from Country A. There are 3 currencies involved. Currency A, USD and Currency B. So far, I use a money guy, he fixes that for me. I thought Bitcoin could do it cheaper and better.
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:19:30
So far my money guy is winning. Looks like it will have to be this way for a long while, since I'm not seeing any advantage that Bitcoin is presenting.

Without specifics, local currency is an African currency, not tradeable beyond its neighbours borders. Receiving currency is Yuan or HKD or even USD (in some cases). 4 ways of solving this, buy USD, as all banks do, then send through Moneygram or Western Union and in many cases convert to foreign currency when receiving. Or even use the Wahalas, but they have major hard currency shortages overseas. Option 2, mule USD. Still have to convert currency, security is a nightmare and then moving with that much cash  is an immigration nightmare. Option 3, Standard old VISA/Mastercard. Works well, but exchange rate is a major ripoff. 4th, EFT. Or, as I do, the best unofficial system, have a money guy. Can't say how he does it, but has never let me down in 15 years. As reliable as a Swiss train or watch.

Not anonymity. Efficiency. My money guy does things quickly, operates 24/7, does not ask too many questions.

No Weibo, Baidu or social media. Not Chinese
@_date: 2016-03-23 12:58:24
I'm beginning to see that.

Because I'm not paying Forex fees and what not. Wasn't that the point in the first place or am I reading this wrong?

Had reached out to Bitpesa earlier. 5%. But thanks for the Crypto Capital Corp idea.

If I have to buy Bitcoin from say Coinbase, then my local currency (Currency A) must first convert it to USD, then, later on, change it from USD to the foreign currency (Currency B). There is no direct Currency A to Currency B conversation without USD in the moddle.

So, my DIY system with my money guy is a far better bet? Looks that way so far.

In the Daily Nation, "Regulated by CBK....." I knew this story would start going badly. Safaricom leaned against the law to kill potential rivals. It's going to be like sword fight wiith Safaricom winning in the end, unless Joe Mucheru steps in and brings some sanity.... *Popcorn*
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:19:59
Clearly there is a lot to this story I did not know and had misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:16:10
OK. Did not know that. So, and I'm still green, where does the anonymous part come in?
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:25:21
Thanks. Had no idea there was an escrow service for Bitcoin.

Fiat??? HODL?

Nope, quick flip. Get paid, and get out.

It was an advisory deal of sorts that happened to fall under our skill sets that we were even lucky to be invited into. This was a side project that honestly I did not have any hope for. We wrote in a proposal, and we've been notified we were successful and it's to be implemented, so we take our fees and walk away. Absolute win-win for us. Doubt we will get another like this.
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:18:52
Doing the transactions in person is no big issue. The guy who I partnered with to do the deal just left for Europe this evening, to go finalise the transaction. He will be at the bank in the morning. What happens afterwards is what we are trying to figure out.

As I learnt from M-Pesa, you guys need to spend a lot of time on the ground recruiting agents, which is literally where you will win, since comparatively, fewer people know Bitcoin and what it can do. Your next few months involves getting agents and businesses to sign up, so that you have massive adoption. Therefore, its door-to-door like an insurance salesman. But kudos!!!
