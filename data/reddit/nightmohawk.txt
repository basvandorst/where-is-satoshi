Your point wasnt missed, you missed other people's points. On your side of the story there's two sides like i already explained. Yes we came a huge way compared to last year, we also lost a huge % compared to last year. thats the point which you seem to miss.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:16:03
Red across the board, still not managed to beat down 10k and been on 9ish for 2 weeks now.. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:45:32
What did you expect? if you bought ATH last year you'd have 500 bucks profit per btc. if you bought ATH this year or even close you'll have about 9k loss or 11k per bitcoin.

Yes cause "you believing btc is on another downtrend for 6 months plus years for another growth" was an educated post. 
You honestly sound exactly the same as every other tool out there screaming 3k by monday 40th of feb at 23:32:32 UTC.

I like how every douche comes up with lower and lower numbers each 200$ we drop. first 8k, then 6k, then again 6k, then 4.8k then 3.5k now 2.5k lol is there a competition of being the biggest clown of 2018?
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:54:17

@_date: 2018-03-18 11:19:24
No clue, but i don't think we'll go up even if the G20 is highly liking btc's ass. There's something going on in this market which i can't figure out yet. Most of it has to do with the big players playing with the market and people's dreams. Too much hype in Dec caused lots of idiots to join the market, which big players seem to enjoy cause those are the ones that run away the fastest and basically hand over their money.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:06:23

@_date: 2018-03-08 13:00:19
one wonders if it's "need" that made him sell, or just pure market trolling with 180k to go. We seen what 6/8k has done to a price, imagine what 180k would do.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:04:17

@_date: 2018-03-21 10:34:10
honestly, slow growths dont do a thing. when a whale dumps we drop hundreds at a minute. so why not be happy to go up hundreds at a time too. the faster back to over 12k the better in my eyes.

Yes and when it hits 3k people will say it'll hit $200. Random clowns jump out when the price goes down making predictions of lower prices cause why the heck not :)

Another day, same colour red over the charts
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:06:33
If you think like that. Than whales would never see use for another ATH ever again. just dump btc at around 11-9k and pump it up from 7/8k. Just to do it all over again in about a week.

I get what you're saying and would love that too. But at this point you and everyone else should know that BTC will forever be volatile untill 17 mil people own 1 btc. There are too many big players and btc will therefor always be fast money. I just dont get why we have to go down in simple minutes but want to go up in days pref even slower. While the next drop is going to be big red candles anyway wether we grow slow or fast.

I bought my first at 8k euro, 2nd at 5k euro while still holding the 8k one too. Do whatever you can, or feel like. But don't sell cause of people's stories that it'll hit 3/4k. better to just buy extra if that happens than to sell your holdings and miss it cause the 3/4k didnt came.
