Late the show here, but do not be careful when doing larger transactions. Go balls to the wall if that's what you intended to put in the bank. If you start depositing smaller amounts they will think you are doing "structuring" to avoid getting your account a CTR (Cash Transaction Report) to avoid taxes. CTRs aren't bad if you can show what you are doing and put it on that year's taxes. What you don't want them to do is think you are structuring and end up with a Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR). This will get the IRS all over your ass and you can get in serious shit over this and do time.

Alt-coins are over valued right now by a lot. Sometime this year we will see the alt-market correct itself something big I just think. When that happens people will dump back into Bitcoin to prevent a loss. Bitcoin will moon and then people will buy even more. Alt coins aren’t worth it until this price correction happens. Buy Bitcoin while it slumps.

A co-worker saw me watching it in the beginning of November. He saw it going up and up and asked if he should buy some. I didn’t think anything of it and said, “Buy whatever you can afford to lose.” It turns out he waited and actually bought at $19k. He didn’t tell me until January. He was angry with me, but I refuse for it to be my fault. If he bought when I told him he could have sold at 19k via a stop order and totally banked. I don’t get some people. 
This is in Japan by the way. During the run up I was amazed at how many were waiting to buy until it got higher. I was too embarrassed for them to ask if it was because hey don’t understand how this works, or if they think there is some pride in buying the top. I just cringed quietly.

Truth is she should totally have a stop loss ready for when Bitcoin possibly takes off. Then she can dump into BTC and then set a stop loss for that when it finally dumps. Then because alts bleed like mad during those events she can buy back into her beloved Doge at an incredible discount.

Honestly, recently is not the time because there is not enough volume to have enough volatility. When there is I will set a stop order to sell once I’m considerably up to sell depending on how big the market is swinging.  (usually after $300 dip) The market will usually dip much farther then by maybe $1000. Once it looks like it has settled down I will then set a buy stop order to do the same thing. This will prevent you from buying too soon as it might dip further. Then if it does dip further you just adjust the buy order down with it. 
Sometimes you lose as Bitcoin will do what Bitcoin wants to do, but usually you do well.

I’m all for flash sales, but the market’s reaction to the news lately is ridiculous. The SEC said after rejecting the Winklevoss Twin’s ETF to ask them about an ETF in September. Now they give a date of 9/30 which should have been met with positive reaction. 
I guess this is fine because I plan to buy as much as I can between now and then, but it feels like the market is getting dumber because it seems to react negatively to any news at all. ICE announcing Bitcoin having its own exchange on the NYSE, no reaction at all. Weird...
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:02:41

I literally called a deciding point if the market is going to spike up or go down, and it went down and decently hard.

Just some thoughts on the current state of the market. Is it possible that we have reached a point where all the weak hands have been shaken out and only hodlers, bears, and people timing the market are left? Hodlers greatly outnumber everyone else hence the insanely low volume maybe? Thus this creates a situation where a single whale can pump the market and then dump once others pile on some time later for profit? I think this would explain all the "Barts." 
The people that FOMOed last year aren't going to come back unless they see/hear that Bitcoin is hitting all time highs again. This is where the institutional money comes in. They need to be buying this shit up to put the price in a good place to get people to want to buy up that normally wouldn't be in this. Whales need to think more long term and not keep fucking us and themselves long term.

You've been on here a while and you never seem to learn anything. Maybe today will be different. 


As a stock forming this pattern tests old highs, it is likely to incur selling pressure from investors who previously bought at those levels; selling pressure is likely to make price consolidate with a tendency toward a downtrend trend for a period of four days to four weeks, before advancing higher. A cup and handle is considered a bullish continuation pattern and is used to identify buying opportunities.

If you bought at 20K and you held all the way down you are rekt. You have less than a quarter of your value of what you spent. It might take another year or two to get back up there. I have all of my money today and now I have even more BTC for the cost of nothing. Free money you could say.

I don’t spend every waking moment looking at this. I didn’t really start watching seriously again until recently. I have two amazing kids. I’m taking my daughter skiing this weekend for a couple days. You guys are hating on traders. HODL is fine in an up market. I’m not selling the little dips either. When volume is starting slow for the upside it’s time to get out when other indicators are pointing to downwards action too. When it’s dumping there is no reason to HODL. Just stay out until after the masses have lost interest again and again then there is bullish signs from people that actually know what they are talking about. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 09:44:28
Yeah I know, but Bitcoin was a different beast then. Like you said, we will have to see, but I don't see that happening. There are lots of lines of support from here to there. The lowest I can see this going is $2500. If it goes below that then $1000. Under that I might join your line of though, but I think $2500 would likely be the bottom met with a hard bounce.
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:24:09
No. When it got to 15K i was nervous and started watching it like mad since it wasn't suppose to get much beyond 10K at the time. I sold at just under 17K. 
Looks like I know somebody that wishes they sold too. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 11:59:19
If you sold at even 17K or 16K and stayed out all the way down. You now have that much to buy way more BTC than you had before. It’s not about losing it’s about making money. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:07:27

You absolutely should not DCA in during a downtrend. That's fucking idiocy. I don't do the hodl thing, but if I was going to I would use a buy order to buy me in. Bitcoin is struggling and slipping further down, so I would set my buy order to 7200. If we continue to go down further, I would set it at a price I think price action might not reach further down and so on until this shit reverses. That way if you are away or sleeping The computer will buy you in. This could go much farther down. Don't you want all the BTC your money can buy?

Do you really feel it’s that hard to catch the top? Time is money. You can buy stupid amounts of BTC now compared the ATH. You are wasting your time waiting. All you had to do was sell when it was obvious it was going down. You don’t have to call the top perfect and when you buy in you don’t have to catch that perfectly either. Just make sure the market direction has changed and you will kill it.

Since we seem to be at an early trend upwards hopefully, I would like to remind everyone and inform new comers that these sell walls are bullshit. They won't go through if you buy. It's not about to dip hard. This is just a bot ran by a whale trying to keep the price down. If you trigger the price the bot will pull the money down before it can execute to sell. It's all bullshit. It even happens on the buy side sometimes, so don't be fooled there either. 
Huge buy walls or sell walls are fake bullshit that aren't real. Ignore them.

I didn’t have any problem other than high fees at the time. I imagine this go around will be better because there has been so much investment in infrastructure during this down turn.

You don't just willy nilly sell it. In my case I created a stop loss that was outside the bottom of the huge consolidation range Bitcoin has been stuck in since the end of June. There was too much fuckery in the last week or so as we approach the apex of it and things are tightening up, so stop loss was at $9700. I knew if we broke the 89EMA on the 1 day chart it was going to dive for sure and it did. Why? Bitcoin has been above it since 3/27/2019. A few days after that it took off like a rocket. If it broke it we are going down likely to the weekly 21EMA. Higher time frames carry more weight. So the next logical big hurdle was the 21ema on the weekly. In the history of Bitcoin and pretty much all stocks and commodities during a bull run it is considered healthy if the price action dips back down to the weekly 21ema at some point to confirm the strength of the bull market. It will likely bounce hard of it and have continuation to much higher prices. If it breaks then there is the 50 ema breaks on the weekly then this bull run is completely over and  the price will likely head way lower.
\&gt;No it doesn't. "Technical Analysis" is no better than tasseography. There are many people who claim that it works for them because they've been lucky. You can use TA to predict any movement at all just by looking at different aspects. One person might graph a descending triangle over a week, while another graphs an ascending triangle over 3 months. One person might claim that the exchange rate just crossed a critical specific moving average, while another claims it also just crossed a different moving average in the other direction. It is all complete bullshit and if it weren't, then people would be able to actually prove it rather than just making vague claims about it.
Somebody told you that and now you are parroting it. First and foremost; the entire world economy runs on Technical Analysis. What do you think they are doing at stock exchanges every day. Secondly, there are different styles of TA which I think you are trying to get at, but what you described is somebody getting it right while the other (doesn't matter which) is obviously getting it way wrong. There are trading bots that trade all the moving averages, have AI to spot patterns and use all the indicators. For a good one they cost thousands of dollars and are typically used by large banks. If TA is bullshit, then no stock market in the world would exist because it would just be a gamble. 
There are exchanges where you can trade options where if you do it right you can pretty much never lose I haven't dived into it yet because I don't have time right now, but Krown on Krown's Crypto Cave does that and he shows his trades. You can see how much he wins or loses. If you really want to make money in this, you should learn at least the basics.

I never said that was what I was doing. If 7800 breaks, my next target is 7200.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:15:27
Like I said, if 5K breaks, we are going off the deep end to the previous cycle low or lower. That is dire in my book. Not dead as I said before. The 21 EMA is the average of those 21 days price action closes. I still say being below the 21 EMA is a sign the macro has changed. Look how far we have dumped. We aren't just going to bart back up. There is no reason to be bullish when everything else is telling you otherwise. Same goes for bears in a bull market. Don't join a team, just being on the right side of the trade. IMO the right side now is to be in cash. I wouldn't buy anything until this shows signs of a bottom.

@_date: 2019-08-29 01:30:03
Not much of a bounce right here. I doubt it will regain the 89ema on the daily chart at least on the first attempt. It’s going to be pretty strong resistance. I think from here we likely see at least one more leg down to possibly the weekly 22 EMA and then we bounce. If that doesn’t hold we are dumping way down.

There are millions of people trading. They are buying and selling for whatever reason. There strat is not the same as mine and vice versa. If you are doing a market buy or sell you are doing it from the exchange. Limit buys are the only place it is taking place directly between traders. Just watch the price history. There are plenty of times it wouldn't make any since to buy or sell, but people are doing it. That's not on you if you try to sell. 
Also, when are you planning to sell? What's the point to any of this if you just HODL to the grave? If you are planning to sell at some point you are (by your own terms) fucking everyone that came into the space/bought after you. The HODL game makes no sense unless you have a target to get out.

Don’t let your investments sink. Set a point to get out and create a stop loss so the computer will get you out if it dives hard. HODL is a creation of the 1%ers of Bitcoin. They want you to hold their bags. Don’t be a bag holder.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:37:59
I still haven’t bought back. I’m looking to buy around $7K or if that breaks $5K. If $8600 would have held I would have bought, but the daily 21 EMA, 200 simple, and 200 EMA are all there. Price didn’t make it past it and is now making lower highs on each attempt. Price will eventually fold over and head back down for likely a lower low. That’s just how the Bitcoins go.����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:32:12
That’s a good target. We barely spent any time at 6K, so if 6800 breaks I think price will blow through 6K on down to 5K.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:44:06
I just took profits and now Bitcoin is at $9637 at the time of this comment. Time to see where this goes and then decide from there. I'm doing very fine with these pumps and dumps.

Yeah, it’s more fun when it’s going up. I’m just being realistic. It’s going down so until there is reason to be bullish, I’m bearish.

I have a buy order for $8125 currently I’ll move it down as we slide down. I’m only going to win.

@_date: 2019-08-29 12:14:18
Huh?!? As long as it goes down further from where ever you bought it and then you actually buy at a lower price, you get more. There is a whole thing called technical analysis based on statistics. This makes plotting and predicting Bitcoin's movement pretty much easier. You don't even have to catch the dump perfectly. I live in Tokyo so the dump happened at 3am my time while I was sleeping. Regrettably I had thought just before bed to sell at 10,240 something and to create a buy order for 10,350. (willing to take a small loss in the even it goes up.) My thoughts were maybe it doesn't get triggered and it will go down. I then decided not to go against the macro trend of up, so I set my stop loss at 9700. When I woke up Bitcoin had dipped and I was in cash. Now we are down to 9442 at the time of this post. My TA suggests that since we broke 9500, we will likely make it down to the 21 EMA on the weekly chart, but everyone's eyes are going to be on this, so it might get front ran at 9100 or get totally over shot. Either way I will be ready. 
If you are interested in learning technical analyst I recommend [Krown's Crypto Cave]( on Youtube. He puts out a video every day on what Bitcoin is doing and then does a live steam at 10am EST. He's not for everyone has he uses colorful language. He won't give signals, but he shows you how to read the charts and you can weigh your ideas against his. Check him out.

Nope. That’s what buy orders are for. I’ll be fine.
@_date: 2019-10-18 09:34:41
I don't think 6K will hold. Bitcoin didn't spend much time there on the way up, it's probably going to blow through it on the way down. 5K is a more realistic target, but only if 7200 doesn't hold. (monthly 10 simple MA is there) Under 5K I can't tell you. Shit is going to start looking dire. I don't think Bitcoin would be done for, but Bitcoin will survive, but it's going to be rough. I guess $3100 could be a target as the last cycle low, but I don't think we would break that. Hey! Double bottom! Boolish!!!! :D
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:02:26
You don't have to trade every small price change, but when we peaked out at the end of June, that was your signal to sell. Price took a dive and there was no reason to stay in. Then Bitcoin made a lower high. That should have confirmed it was best to stay out. You could have stayed out until now pretty easily. 
I'm not trying shit on you, but HODLing hasn't worked the last couple years. Basically, June was just another lower high since the 2017 high. Just look at the monthly chart.

@_date: 2019-10-18 09:47:00
I'm just looking at price action. When $9400 broke with a big move to the downside, that broke the consolidation pattern as we are below the 21 EMA weekly moving average. That has never happened in a bull market. Just look at the history. That tells me the macro trend has changed and it's time to get bearish and earn more BTC. I dumped everything at $10,200 because it was looking questionable and price action was hanging out at near the bottom of the range. (not bullish) I took a little risk, but a calculated one that if it would break out of the wedge to the top side I would take a small loss of BTC and buy back in. I the chart was saying, it broke down hard to the downside. and I'm in cash from $10,200. You can't blame anyone for doing that. I'll buy a fuck ton more BTC when this shows a sign it's changing direction again, but I still think we have a ways to go before then.

This feels like April 2018. Monthly chart looks like it could end up being just another lower high. Too early to call, but keep that in mind. Sold at $10200. Waiting to see what BTC wants to do. I don't think it is very likely, but what if this is the biggest bull trap of all time?

Bots aren't watching social media because AI isn't good at interpreting the news. Trading the news is a bad idea anyways because it doesn't always follow it. Just look at the last 6 months. Lots of news that should have pumped it, but the market didn't care. It's much easier to program a bot to trade the TA flawlessly. There are so many indicators that a human can get overwhelmed and miss something that could have more weight at any given time. A bot isn't going to miss this. Hence they are perfect for this job. They are also way faster at making the trade.

This volume right now looks pretty weak. I have a feeling we will take a leg down to retest the daily 200MA and 200 EMA and then bounce from there. So a pull back to about $6650 and then it will try again hard for $5K.
Got downvoted for not being permabull. I'm agnostic on price action. Long term I think we are going up, but it looks like a pullback for now to nothing terrible. I think the 200MA and 200 EMA both of which we haven't been above in over a year will act as support and we will bounce from there. What's wrong with call it for what it is likely to do.
TO THE MOON WE GOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

I have no doubt Bitcoin will reverse, but I’m almost up 2 additional BTC if I buy back now. No way in hell I’m doing that as of this comment. Bitcoin confirmed a new local low on the weekly chart. That’s confirming the strength to the downside is becoming more aggressive too. There is more free Bitcoins to be taken.

It will likely pump this week due to the fork on the 15th. I would sell on the 14th just to be safe. I imagine this fork will be a shitfest. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:43:58
This will probably get downvoted to shit, but who else has been buying these Bcash pre-fork pumps and then dumping when they dump. I’m using it to make me more Bitcoin buying money in the short term. The Bcash fork happens on Thursday. I’d get out several hours before he fork just to be safe.
Before somebody says anything against it; Bcash will so itself in. I’m getting as much BTC as I can before the banks do and these fork pumps are a great way to do so. 
Back into BTC I will go later this week.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:04:07
Here’s what I do. Set up a Sell Stop Order on whatever exchange you are on (Coinbase uses GDAX) at $300 under the current price. For example now it’s $10,950, so set it to sell your BTC at $10,600. Giving it $300 move space means if it reaches your sell price it is very likely going to go far beyond it. Once your money sells, Don’t buy right back in give it an hour or so to make sure it doesn’t drop farther (The FOMO gets very real here). Then if it looks like it’s done dipping, buy in again (preferably with a Limit Buy so you don’t pay any fees when you buy) Then wait for the price to go up about $500 and set a Stop Order. 
If you buy under where you sold you will get more Bitcoin in your buy each time. You can’t lose this way, but knowing when to buy is he hardest part.

That's fine. I have a decent amount of money on deck to buy more. Just waiting for it to bottom out. It's evening here in Japan. I'm guessing I should hold off buying until tomorrow morning at the earliest to let America dump all over it too. Then we will see where we end up at.

It's very likely there is a dip coming of $300. I would wait for that. We are also going into the weekend and lots of people sell over the weekend for whatever reason.

It’s fine. A lot of hodlers get butthurt if you do anything other than hodl. It was a good strategy last cycle as Bitcoin was going to the moon. Now I think we are going to see more dips more often with slower growth, so better to make money going both directions.

Hey, man! How are your BTC doing?�� [You talked shit when I said it wasn’t sustainable.]( I sold and stayed out since yesterday. It’s looking pretty good now. Just as soon as it shows that it has truly bottomed out I will buy back in and not only will I instantly have more BTC than I had before. I’m going to make money all the way back up. Holy shit!!! I’m making money going both directions, increasing volume, and making the market a healthier place as hodling causes unhealthy growth if too many do it.

I said elsewhere in this thread to wait to sell the Bcash until Wednesday as there will likely be a pump this week due to the Bcash fork. I would then wait on selling any BTC because there has been a lot of positive news for BTC. Intuitional money is entering the market soon.

It sucks, but you don’t lose any fiat. You just lose BTC. It’s not ideal, but better than losing both. It’s only happened to me once kind of. I usually never sell by a Limit Order. I typically use Stop Orders to stop my loss at a particular price I’m not willing to go below. One time it just dipped past my Stop Order and then started going right back up. I saw it happen, so I lost a little bit of BTC, but if I remember right it wasn’t that much. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:27:58

@_date: 2018-11-03 00:17:00
Of course he did. He wants people to open up shorts with leverage. It very likely won’t dip below 6k in the next month so he wants to liquidate some idiots when the price goes up with BAKKT.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:46:58
Yeah, there is risk. You can mitigate a lot of it though. Stop Orders are you best friend. Use them to know when to sell and when to buy, but don't be greedy with them. I usually set them $300 under what ever the current price is once I've cleared that from my initial buy. Then as the price goes up $100 I change the Sell Stop Order. If it spikes, don't adjust for that. Wait an hour or two and see what it's going to do. Likely it will come back down. You don't want to false trigger a spike unless it's mooning hard. Then get the goods, but when you are out it's hard to know when to buy back in.
Use a Buy Stop Order, but do it the other way around. Set it $300 above the current price. Change the order as the price drops and then when it triggers that's where you are back in. 
This has worked well for me most of the time. Don't let FOMO get the best of you. If you made a plan then stick to it. It's very likely that if you change someting because of FOMO or some other fear or greed it will fuck you.

A 246 BTC buy wall on GDAX just dissolves like as if it wasn't even there. Fucking useless. Why do people do that? They put it up and then as it gets close they take it down. It doesn't intimidate anyone. The selling side knows it's going to be taken down. The buy side is always broke dick when it comes to those things.
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:18:29

@_date: 2018-03-18 06:32:04
I guess you have to blame somebody. Shorting is how you make money. HODLing only works when the market is bullish. It is now bearish, so you are contributing zero to increasing volume. You are also watching the value of your BTC shrink. Meanwhile, I am accumulating more and more BTC by continually buying low and selling when it starts to dip. I never trigger a dip, but a few hundred dollars dip below the current price and I have the computer sell it via a Stop Order. I do the same thing when buying. 
Tell me why you wouldn't do it this way?

@_date: 2018-03-19 08:29:57
Sorry for the late reply. No it's not IMO. I like it volatile because it means things change quickly. 
What I did this morning (Japan Standard Time as I'm in Tokyo) I set a buy Stop Order for $7700. Around 6am JST it triggered. It's a little dangerous because I was sleeping, but that is how it goes sometimes. When I woke up at 6:45am JST I saw it was already over $8K and going up fast. I then set a sell Stop Order for $8K because the price was at $8300 something at that time. It went up to $8400 so I then moved by sell Stop Order to $8100. As it goes up every $100 I move up the order accordingly. Keeping a $300 gap between the current price and the price you want to sell at works well. It allows the price to move up and down some without cashing you out before a decent dip. Usually a decent dip is what is going to set off your order and it will usually go well beyond where you sold out meaning you are prime to buy again.
When buying again you should do the same thing, but in reverse. Put the buy Stop Order $300 above the current price. That way the price can move and keep going down if that's what it is going to do. I usually wait an hour or so after a dip because people are frantic trying to scoop up the dip, so you have no idea where the price might end up at. Better to let the sand settle for an hour or so. It often dips further after a dead cat bounce. That's it!
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:41:29
Not me. I almost bought some more today, but it's already Thursday evening here and the weekend is coming, so I decided to hold off because it usually dumps on the weekend. I'll buy more when it shows a sign of reversing. I don't want to get caught in a bear trap.

No it sold at $11,575. I bought back in at $11,300 when it stopped dipping for a bit. Previously we weren't seeing dips like this since it showed signs of recovering. Unfortunately it dipped more. I had previously bought in last at $11, 200, so I made a little gains on these smaller dips. I'm up now unless I sell. I'm just curious what is your strat for making gains.

What’s your problem with it?!? Do you not already own Bitcoin? If no, what are you waiting for? If you already own it then you are good to go. Wall Street is going to drag in the common person in to buying BTC either via an ETF that ends up being apart of their 401K or some mutual fund, etc. Just because of the nature of how Bitcoin works the price will skyrocket. If you own your own wallet there is nobody that can take it away from you. 
If you are one of those fucktards that think they are hipper than thou and that you were into Bitcoin before it was “cool.” Then go fuck yourself. You are in it for the wrong reasons. Bitcoin is going to dominate he world of Wall Street and the likes get involved. Don’t be a dummy.

My Man!�� That’s what I do too. Bought at 19k back in December. Then bought every thousand dollars as it fell. (Thanks Stop Orders) Then finally sold everything when it hit $6000. I’m new to investing so I’m sure I did something wrong, but until I see otherwise I will keep doing it this way. I’m thinking about starting a cryptocurrency YouTube channel for investing tips. I’ll cover the cheap and hot coins, cheap hot ICOs, and give people the heads up on the already proven successful lending platforms like Bitconnect, but these won’t fail! Stay tuned!

I figured that since it is expected that the G20 will be positive news for the space, many people would FOMO back in. It doesn't start until tomorrow, so I guess we will see. I don't think it will really dip that much if it does. We are now back at $8243 at the time of my response, so I think we will have to wait and see. There is no reason to dump now though. This week should be on the up and up I think.

@_date: 2018-03-15 14:18:11
Not exactly. I sell high when a dip starts to go off and then buy low after I'm sure it has bottomed out. When I buy at the bottom I end up with more BTC in my control every time and if the price is trending upward, that means I get more BTC without ever having to enter more of my fiat into the system. It's working out really well and I gotten more this way than I could afford to buy.
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:55:58
It's risky AF right now. When it was at $11,700 something I had a Stop Order to sell at $11,575. It dipped down to $11,300 which it looked like it was as far as it was going to dip. I was wrong. Now I'm stuck waiting for it to get above $11,300. Fuuuu....
So what is your strat?
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:17:40
I guess $8500 is the new point of new resistance. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:41:53
I'm a bit tired of this up and down mess, but I've been killing it predicting the dips. Got out at the top of this one at $8316 as it was clear it wasn't going to hold. I will buy back in when it crosses my Stop Order.
@_date: 2019-01-24 01:00:10
It was going to get rejected no matter what and nobody not already in wants to buy until they see "dem gainz," so knowing the ETF wasn't going to pass means price wasn't going to do anything. 
The thing more people should be excited about besides this stupid ETF is Bakkt. That's actually coming just as soon as American gets its shit together and reopens the government. About a month after opening Bakkt will launch. That's the real thing, but for some reason nobody get that.

Good night all. Looks like BTC is stalled. For the last two nights my sell Stop Order has been triggered due to dips of $300 or more. I hope it doesn't happen tonight as it will be for a loss. I'm afraid to go to bed without once because I would likely wake up with it at $6K. 
Anyway, good luck to everyone. Hopefully the volume picks up. Good night!
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:01:11
I set it a few hours ago now and it hasn’t triggered yet. Maybe it’s been fixed?

I would be happy if they would stop banning people for moving to a different country. I use to live in America and had a Paypal account since 2000. Moved to Japan and last year used my Paypal account after a long time of not using it. The transaction went through, but shortly there after they banned my account because they didn't believe I moved to Japan. I called their 3rd party help desk in India, but they were rude and treated me like a criminal. I asked to talk to a supervisor and their solution was to never use Paypal again. They actually told me to not bother with them again and was dickish about it too. WTF.

@_date: 2018-02-24 10:34:27
Yeah they are. That's exactly how you short. They sell to bring it down when it got to a place they wanted. Then once all the stupid bottom sells are done fucking themselves they will buy in again sending it spiking up a few hundred dollars or so. People start buying it up thinking this is the time to buy back in. The whale will let this go on for a day or so and then rinse wash repeat. It's shit. They profit every time from it.

I woke up at 5am a couple nights ago and panic bought at $5620 on Binance. It was below $5700 which was the price I wanted to buy at for a little while. It was making small, but greater and greater higher lows, so I didn't want to miss out. I can deal with it going lower, but I would have been pissed if I woke up and it was over $5700. Swiss Crptyo ETP approved. BAKKT on 12/12. I think things will turn out around sooner than later.

@_date: 2018-03-30 08:07:32
I bought $300 more 4 hours ago because it’s a good deal. I have a Stop Order set for when it dips and I will adjust it as it climbs. Then after it sells I will buy the bottom again with same cash plus gains. I win when it goes both up and down. That’s the only way to win in the current market. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:43:40
Couldn’t he sell the Bitcoins into fiat and then rebuy and He would have different Bitcoins? I’ve always wondered how this works. I guess they could also send the BTC to another account that has Monero and then send that Monero to another Monero address then cash out and buy BTC with it. Those new BTC wouldn’t be able to be traced back to the original BTC.

Your best bet is to play stupid and act like you don't know where they are and claim you don't have them over and over again. Call their bluff. If you don't have it then that's that. If you do have them and still have to do time, at least you have some fat cash when you get out that you can switch into Monero or whatever privacy coin is around at the time via an anonymous wallet. Have another anonymous wallet set up to send those Monero to and then you can have clean BTC from that. I wouldn't a huge amount of BTC in a wallet with my name ever again because I'm sure the Feds would be watching.

There are tons of red flags. The biggest being they broke off relations with the people that were going to do the audit for them to prove they have the cash to back it. 
If it's too good to be true it probably is. 
If the coin gets popular enough they won't be able to back the coin with USD. That's the problem.

Lots of people bitching about low volume and the pricing falling. I have a feeling this is due to the G20 coming up next week. People are afraid there will be bad news, but I think it will be mostly good. The leaders want regulation which  I think is a good thing. Once good news comes out I think we will see a rise in price. Notice I didn’t say moon. It will be significant though.

LOL! This is a noob mindset. If nobody sells high and buys low it means we moon like crazy or the market just sits still. Neither are healthy. You make way more bitcoin by selling high and then buying back in far under where you sold. So rather than spending money on the dips, you are using your own money to buy the dips getting paid more in fiat when you sell high and then getting more in bitcoin when you buy low. I don't think hodling is going to work out as well this time around. I think it's way more healthy for the market if people are playing the market.

I hate the way GDAX draws candles now. It favors ajusting the scale to smaller units so it can draw bigger candles. I feel this will only make people FOMO over nothing when it looks like it's mooning based on candles, but in reality it just went up $100.

Good morning from Japan. I just sold. This spike up isn’t going to last. It’s on a Sunday in the west and the EMA12 is about to cross the EMA26 on its way down.

The order book or visualizations of the order book don't matter. There are is so much spoof trading in it you can't make anything of it. The only thing that matters is the trade history. Other than that moving averages are much more useful.
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:51:46
Yeah, I was being sarcastic. I think we might get a little bounce up to $8730 (200 EMA at the time of this post) and it will very likely get rejected and head down to retest the 200 MA. ($8325 at the time of this post) We will be between these moving averages for a bit until it likes breaks further to the downside. We are way too far down for it do Bart back up. (anything is possible though, but unlikely) I think there is more downside to go for a while.
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:05:02
I was there for that. I wish I wasn’t doing the hodl thing then because I went right back to where I started. It wasn’t until February that I started playing the dips and it works really well on the way down. 
I’m talking about the two day greatest green dildos man has ever seen where it just went up non-stop. That’s when you have to be ready with a stop order.

I’ve seen this before, but I want more Bitcoin for free. I sold at 10,200 and have been out since then. We are now at the monthly 21EMA. If we bounce (would have happened by now) I buy. If we go lower then I get more Bitcoin. I’m not here to support the HODL people. I’m here to take as much as I can and I’m sure others are too.

Looks like we are getting a correction now.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:14:32

@_date: 2018-02-21 05:46:05
I hope they buy. If they didn’t Have a Stop Order setup they missed the big gains. Better to either wait to see what it’s going to do from here or buy. Selling would be pointless at this point IMO. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:56:08
Lol! Probably, but that's how people learn.
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:15:11
It probably would be smarter at this point to set a buy order safely above the 200EMA if price breaks above that you are golden for more up action. I would just hold for now otherwise. It's likely to go down further.
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:10:51
I’m assuming they haven’t bought back in yet and it continued to dip. Depending on the volatility I will set my buy order about $300 over the current price. If it makes it up to it then I will buy in. If it doesn’t then as the price goes down I adjust the order. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:12:18
Sold at $10,200 and was out until $8,127. I have a stop-order set for $8,175 in the event we are going down further. So far the 200MA is doing its job. If it wants to go down further I will be totally fine. More BTC for the price of nothing.
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:19:54
Agreed. This is just a small correction. People complaining either haven't been around long or don't get it. I doubt it goes under 8K. People will see that as a sweet buy opportunity and will buy it up.
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:28:11
Why even bother with that scam? Just sell to USD and buy back when in when it shows it's hit the true bottom. Tether is a risk.
@_date: 2019-09-11 09:23:46
I don't know if now is the time to buy. I dumped everything at the last test of getting above $10300 and have been out since. I have a buy order set for $10150, but I doubt we will get up to that after what I have seen over the last several hours. If there is a bounce of $9450, I will buy it. Otherwise, my next target is $8800. If we don't bounce from there it's going to be $7600. After that I think we are in deep trouble. I will then stay out until there are signs of a recovery. Then I'm all back in with a huge Bitcoin gain. That's how I would play this right now.

You would probably be better off taking that Bitcoin and short it at the high peaks and then rebuy at the dips. Then give her the cash for that.

Seems all the movement today is coming from single large buys. Institutional money coming into the space now? Could April be hot month? I'm not saying anything just yet other than today is looking good. :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:37:12
For those looking at GDAX; that sell wall at $9000 is not real. It will vanish at the very last second. Keep buying right on through it. Pretend it's not there.
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:04:54
No it doesn’t. Do you know how to use a stop-loss?
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:28:29
I know.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:58:35
I just banked on the dip. Thanks I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:58:19
I did the same and lost a little on my gainzzz, but still gained pretty well. Dips don’t seem to be happening. *knocks on wood*

I sold last night my time when when the dip happened. It triggered my Stop Order. (can I be blamed for selling then?) I bought in again this morning with a little extra on top because the getting is good. (my time)

As soon as this bottoms out it might be arbitrage time if I can find a return coin close enough in price or arbitrage the other direction.

*Cough* 1969.

If you smartly set a stop order to sell, it will always go passed where you set it on a dip. I'm not talking about little dips. I'm talking about a pretty decent dip of more than $300. After a larger dip it usually moves sideways for hours before recovering or dipping further. Look in the history of this and you will see I am right. Even if I was wrong one time, you will have made so much from it, it won't hurt you to be wrong that one time. 
Just for fun I predict we will have a Bart form here on the 5 mins chart. I think this run up is done for now, but if I'm wrong, big deal. That means we will just go up. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:03:05
Right on. I bet that thing under stears like crazy. Could be really fun.

Paypal could make billions if they would play the middle man in this. If Indian users could transfer money between exchanges using Paypal they could move the money from the exchanges back to their bank account after withdrawing to Paypal. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:46:23
Use Stop Orders. Buy low, sell when it starts to dip.

Indian people should then swear off fiat and do business with BTC wherever possible. Cut the banks out of the loop. I know it's easier said than done, but let them slit their own throat. They made the choice.
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:34:55
The value of that is priceless. Good luck, my friend.��
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:46:27
I said I wasn't going to do anything today because I was mad at America for being weak while I slept, but I bought anyway because of those hot hot prices. Today is looking better than what happened last night. (I'm in Japan) Sadly, when the east coast of America wakes up and they see the hard gains Asia (and I hope Europe when you guys get up) have made they will go all limp dick and fail to keep it up and sell for gains again. 
Prove me wrong, America. Do something for the rest of us today. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:31:10
Look at the history.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:46:42
Are you looking at 1 minute candles? If so, don't do that. 5 minutes is good for live action trading. and then the other times are good for shitty TA that people post here when they think they have it all figured out. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:12:17
I know where you have money stuck at now. :D
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:49:33
It usually hasn’t. You often buy back much lower than you sold. In December did you sell? No? That’s a lot of gains missed out on that would mean more BTC later. This isn’t rocket science.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:57:27
Same, but don't clean it up too good or I won't be able to find anything. There's a balance.
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:35:58
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:55:49
I’m not sure if you are serious, but yeah you got scammed. Better just forget about it and move on. It’s not coming back. If it’s too good to be true, it’s always a scam.

Godspeed, Bulls.
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:31:08
Then all the news would talk about would be it's an insane bubble even bigger than they say it is already. There would be solid proof that this is all speculative with no real value as nobody does anything with it other than holding it endlessly. Many people would start selling and the price would dive. Similar to what happened in December, but much much worse. The price going up and down is healthy for real growth.
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:22:15
Trading is where you make the money. If it dips here soon it means I will make money on the way down too where you will be going negative.

LOL! I am American. I live in Japan though. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:31:40
I’m teasing. It just seems that when it’s been a good day here in the Far East America sells off all the gains when they wake up.
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:15:46
This is true! When things are packed away in closets even if you know where it is you have to dig it out and then put it back. Nothing you use regularly should be packed up like that. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:32:47
As a foreigner even with fiat, nearly impossible. Our place is in my wife’s name. (Japanese National) I’ve never even looked into buying property with BTC to be honest, so I can’t say.
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:21:04
Wait for the dip. It's coming. Volume is trailing off now. The pump is done, but then I could be wrong. I would wait though.
@_date: 2018-04-09 09:14:07
It's pretty easy to do. there are always decent dips. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:33:04
And will have more Bitcoin when they buy in. I seriously think people here don’t know or aren’t willing to learn how to use it.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:30:12
First and foremost get fucked. Second, it’s been all over the news that they are looking to get in and it’s obvious that’s who keeps buying it upwards now. 
Your post history shows you are socially retarded when dealing with people in conversation. Please stfu up and go away. Thanks. �� 
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:45:10
That's the spirit! Buy high/sell low. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:31:03
Did you guys see that on GDAX?!?!? LOLOLOL!!!!! That $9000 200BTC buy wall just got nuked as the buys went right on through. Good job, guys!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:15:38
Didn't your Stop Order go off? Mine sold at $7200. Now I'm waiting for it to settle down so I can safely buy back in. I doubt I doubt it will go much lower than $7000. It seems to have a lot of support at that level. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:30:40

There is a greater distance between 17.5 and 8.2 than 6.5 and 8.2.
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:35:30
Nothing here.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:07:37
Why would you sell at 8.2k?!? It will eventually get back up to 17.5k, so you just threw away money. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:28:54
Start using Stop Orders. That way if it dips when you sleep, the server will sell for you and you get sweet sweet gainzzz. Then hopefully it hasn't gone back up when you wake up and you can set a buy order to make sure you don't buy back in too early.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:48:53
I normally have it set to only trigger if it dips $300 below the current price.  I would be ok.  At the lowest I would do it at $150 below current price. As a result I was fine on this dip. Waiting to see which way it will go and then will buy back in.
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:49:19
Oh look! America is awake. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:16:59
Couldn’t you use other money for that? Who’s to say your most recent investments don’t dive too? Do you bottom sell again? It just seems like poor planning. 17.5k was not a good time to buy. Even then you apparently didn’t use a Stop Order. You could of had a reasonable profit even though you missed out on most of the gains.
I’m only giving you shit because I saw your post that got removed. It bother me that people come into this space, make poor decisions, don’t bother to learn how to use the trading tools to minimize risk, and then have the loudest whiny voices all over social media saying it’s going to zero or it’s a scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:20:27
Nope, America can get fucked. Woke up here in Japan this morning to see the broke dick selling and weak buying that happened since the east coast of America woke up. I'm just going to sit here and do nothing today. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:54:02
Sure if you can clean my house. I don't like doing that.

How? You never can lose in that situation.

That sucks, dude. Surely there has to be a away. Binance account some foreign bank that will let you create an account. Then you can cash out to the foreign bank and then wire the money to your bank in India. They will never know.

Europe will be waking up soon. Are they going to take profits? Highly likely. Please don't though.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:41:34
Using that same logic you could also say it could go to $4000 or even $0. I've yet to see that happen. I'm in Japan so when I'm sleeping nothing usually happens while on America's watch after 11pm my time. It's now 10:39am here now and we had a small pump. 
TL; DR:
Your fear of stop orders is that it could dip hard and then pump hard making you miss out while you are sleeping. This has never happened in such a short time frame, but silly fears are just that.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:28:07
So it's been a great day in Asia here today. What is America going to do when they wake up?
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:37:34
Well, first I’m white, but they tend to work late here. Not early.
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:16:04
If things go parabolic again I will like set a stop order to sell after it dips $1000 dollars to sell everything. I assume it’s going much lower and will set an order to buy going the other direction. If it continues to dip then I will keep adjusting my buy stop order accordingly.
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:20:40
Why would you sell at the end of the day? Stop Orders, bro! They're your friend.

Looks like bullshit to me. It doesn’t have any other coins on the exchange which would make it faster to move money back to the starting point.
