You should check out Dash then, if you transfered Bitcoins traffic over to Dash, they would not have those problems due to node incentivisation.
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:20:43
Looks like we are just trying to copy Dash. Guess, they are on the right track over there.  
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:23:36
Im not worried either, I just got all in bitcoin and am now going long. Short no longer matters to me, I remember considering selling my litecoins because they went from $2.5 to $1.5, what a mistake that would have been.
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:01:00
You still around tulipfutures, you honestly need to get a life and focus on something productive instead of coming on here everyday and trying to convince people that bitcoin is about to crash.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:19:18
Thanks mate, will tip it forward :)
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:57:05
I agree. Although there are ways to secure your bitcoins we are not entirely ready for mainstream usage until such a simple solution is developed.
I do feel we will need something like this fast as things may start to move very quickly around here.

It was at the peak of a bubble at the beginning of the year so kinda hard to perform well in Q1.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:43:59
Bitcoin has survived so much over these past few months (china, mtgox, russia) and seems to be still holding strong. These next few months are going to be huge!
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:26:42
Not saying it will 100% but it makes seems logically viable. I know I will be giving more than 5 people their first bitcoin wallet and a substantial amount which they can then tip on forward. They have expressed interest but have just been to lazy to get started. 
If the bulk of the community does this it will raise a lot of awareness and give a lot of people their first taste of bitcoin.

Well said, I definitely learnt the hard way when I initially invested. Best lesson to learn is day traders are good at trading, average joes are bad.
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:28:33
I agree some people have large holdings but the benefits it brings far out way that. There will pretty much always be a top 1%. The 1% at the top right now have consistently shown us that they don't care about the rest of the world so why not have a new 1%. If you can think of a way to evenly distribute money then that would be great but until then this is our best option.
Bitcoin is going to open up the globe to the financial system and decrease the ever growing disparity between the rich and the poor by significantly reducing remittance fees etc. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:01:47
$350 is possible but very hopeful, I am buying back in now because I am not worried about the short term and am very happy with this price. I don't think it is possible to hit $100 or $200 with all the progress that bitcoin has made. These wall street guys are getting serious about bitcoin, everyone thought china was huge but this is going to be next level and china is not going anywhere. They will use local bitcoins if they have too. Once second markets exchange hits, everyone will forget about gox.
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:55:46
PBOC already denied reports last week that they were going to ban Bitcoin so even if this new report is true, Bitcoin is not leaving China. Bobby Lee said two days ago that even if the rumor is true "one option would be for customers to use cash to make direct deposits with BTC China." There is also always local Bitcoins. Its not the end of Bitcoin people, I would be very wary of selling this cheap as this is still only a rumor that would not even kill Bitcoin in China!
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:42:37
Have you ever seen any type of network technology have a nice an steady rise to an ipo? No! Facebook and twitter had huge swings in valuation over the first few years due to set backs etc. We are pre ipo if you could compare bitcoin to a company, so large swings are expected and will gradually decrease as the network expands, just like facebook and twitter.
@_date: 2014-04-12 11:16:51
There are many merchants who have just not put themselves on this map and many online merchants who do not have physical locations so are not on this map but yes we are very small.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:38:48
You are scum creating and supporting hoaxs like this. This is not btcchina posting this guys, look at history etc. If btcchina was going to announce this they would post on twitter
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:32:34
Its not that gutsy to a Bitcoin veteran who is accustom to these sort of drops. In 10 years it will be either worth that or nothing, everyone knows that.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:02:10
tulipfuters, I think most people that are buying bitcoins understand there is a risk, but it is one that most people are willing to take as we believe in the technology. I think you need to watch this video so you can understand how the bitcoin price valuation works. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:12:00
It is not being banned in china, PBOC even stated that. This is only a rumor and even if its true then people will just have to use localbitcoins.com or use cash to make direct deposits with BTC China. Not the end of chna at all. Watch fiat leak and you will realise that!
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:45:16
So you would rather support a system that continues to not work and increasingly rewards the top 1% by taking money from the poor? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:25:19
If Barry Silbert dumped we would see a lot more damage to the price than this.
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:54:48
Go do the research yourself before posting a title like that.
@_date: 2014-03-29 08:17:54
Booby Lee made a statement today saying "that one option would be for customers to use cash to make direct deposits with BTC China." So even if the ban is true, bitcoin will carry on in China. Here is the article  google the title to avoid the paywall
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:05:50
Mycelium will definitely do the job for now. I think that we need every wallet to be at this standard or better though so we don't have newbies using insecure wallets without knowing that their is a solution out there. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 07:07:34
Its definitely to do with the atm's in china 
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:58:01

I jumped in at the bottom of the April bubble.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:34:44
How do you think money comes into existence, it is lent out with an interest rate. How can you ever pay back something that is lent to you at an interest rate when the only way you can get more of it is for the lender to print more? Inflation is going to be never ending with the governments getting into more and more debt until our taxes can't even repay the interest on that debt. What happens then? How do we pay our government agencies?
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:12:26
Doesn't matter, darkcoin is here anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-30 06:54:27
Yes into Bitcoin at the end of the bubble, haven't been using reddit for very long.

Facebook and Twitter produce nothing, other than a network that people connect on. This is a network for money.
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:39:14
Exactly what I found and is why I wrote this post earlier.

Kimoto (the creator of KGW and the dev for Megacoin) has had multiple big projects in the works for sometime now. I wouldn't be surprised if this is rolled out using Megacoin.

Microsoft looking to further explore bitcoin 
Ready, who describes Braintree’s support as PayPal’s “first foray” into bitcoin, says the move was a conscious decision by the PayPal leadership to work more closely with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:40:20
He created KGW which is now basically used by every single coin. No other developer has accomplished such a feat.

Dash runs on X11.
It is called Dash by the way, not dashcoin.
Maybe go to  if you want help with mining
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:04:45
There isn't much of a need to sell unless you have a huge amount of money in bitcoin and are looking to buy a house or something. Otherwise just spend bitcoin where it is accepted and use a bitcoin debit card in the places that it isn't yet accepted. 
I would way rather have my wealth in bitcoin than a fiat bank account. You are talking about selling a deflationary currency for an inflationary currency, doesn't make much sense if you can spend bitcoin anywhere that visa and mastercard are accepted.

Is it easy to share your stream on social media? That would be an easy step to gaining traction. If I saw a friend set up a stream I might be interested and then when I realise I need bitcoin to see the stream I might be a little more interested.
@_date: 2016-09-30 18:15:47
I can confirm this too. My brother in law has been locked out of his account for months because of them not sending a verification email. He has emailed support for months and had no answer. I tried to help by wording an email and also tweeting to brain armstrong but still nothing. Really bad Coinbase 
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:07:21
These last 12 months have been huge, maybe not price wise but certainly news wise. 
Haha, that would have been a mistake I sold in the $20 range. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:00:17
Megacoins blockchain maybe? It would make sense, would go with his branding perfectly.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:28:04
I am having the exact same problem. 
Is a real hassle because I live off of my xapo debit card which I can't top up and use because I am blocked out of my account. I haven't even done more than 1 btc in volume. Not a great look Xapo. If you are going to request verification work then at least quickly review our verification when we send it in.
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:58:20
It is actually called Dash not dash coin, just shows how much you know about it. You are only driving people away from Bitcoin with hostility. I own bitcoin and use bitcoin, I also own and use dash. I am free to use whatever form of money I want to and that is awesome. Being hostile towards someone for using a different money is exactly what the U.S Government does, don't snoop to their level.
@_date: 2015-02-17 08:34:21

Or he could have already created his own cryptocurrency "Megacoin".
