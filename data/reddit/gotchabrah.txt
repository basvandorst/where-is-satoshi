But if everyone is just holding bitcoin and not actually using it for anything, then like... what's the point? I get that the point is that the expectation is that it gets more valuable and you make money, but I'm talking at a fundamental level, if no one actually uses bitcoin, and it just sits on an HD somewhere then... the fuck is the point of bitcoin?

Oh shit everyone, look at the bitcoin/finance wizard over here! He can predict the future of the markets! What are you now? Millionaire? Billionaire? Stop talking out of your ass. I'm getting second hand embarrassment

Seriously. These people absolutely amaze me. They have know clue about finance or investing, but now they think they are Gordon fucking Gecko and come up with these reasons for their actions that aalllllmost sound plausible but really, at the end of the day it's just pure speculation and blindly throwing darts at a dartboard. If absolutely anyone thinks they have a winning strategy for trading bitcoin (outside of just routinely purchasing regardless of price consistently) they are kidding themselves. It's actually kind of sad because other clueless well meaning people who have even less of an idea will read that, it'll sound good to them because they don't know any better, invest more than they can lose, and then will be shocked when their financial health is in the shitter. There will be/already is some serious collateral damage, and it really bums me out. At the end of the day, people are gonna do what they wanna do, and that's.... the way the cookie crumbles.
Good luck everyone, and I wish you all the best of luck just don't lie to yourselves, or worse other people who don't know any better. I hope it goes up to 100,000 and y'all are laughing at me from your yachts. Best of luck.

Everyone knows the best way to diversify your bitcoin position is to 'invest' in futures contracts. Of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:23:39
Also, what's hilarious to me is that cryptic start to crash and people cheer. They want it to go lower and lower and lower and every time it drops they dump more money in because they just KNOW it's all gonna end up at 100,000. 
Could imagine that thought process in literally any other investment?!'what? A crash for 60% of value?!?! HELL YEA BUT BUY BUY!' One day, it won't rebound and they will just be completely flabbergasted. And I guarantee people will throw mo way at it until it's at .00001. 
I read a comment from some dumbass earlier where he was discussing the volatility of BTC and this guy was like... you say you invest in it for the technology and for BTC to become the global currency one day (lol) and he talked about how it's waayyyy too volatile because ya know... it just dropped 50% and the other guy said 'yea I know! That's the beauty of it' 
Really?! That's the beauty of it?!?! Am I taking fucking crazy pills?! Yeaaa this currency is so fucking  volatile it just lost 50% of its value in two days and your response is 'that's the beauty of it'?!?! Who are these people?! I just, it's not my money and I know I shouldn't care... but fuck it drives me insane because they think they are smarter than everyone else, and they are executing the stupidest fucking gambles I've ever seen. Unreal.

Look at this everyone! This guy did the impossible! He's able to accurately and confidently predict market trends, and he absolutely knows when it will be at which price! 
Have you considered taking your skills to a hedge fund?? They'd pay a very pretty penny for someone with your talents. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:10:43
When you're at work, and that annoying middle aged woman with all the cats talks shit to you about bitcoin dropping and you think to yourself 'shut the fuck up margery why are you such a cunt?' Think back to this post. When people like to rub salt in the wounds of some bitcoin bandits, it's because the don't shut up about it ever, and say just completely moronic things like this. Margery may be boring, and she may smell weird, but her coworkers don't have to listen to her wax economically (poorly) about bitcoin every day. 
Just something to keep in mind. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:19:40
The beauty of it? I would *love* for you to explain that line of reasoning for me. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:16:49
Haha absolutely. Take out a mortgage on your apartment (especially if your renting) go to another back... take on another one out it all on TRON. Yolo and hodl. Enjoy the yacht.

Ah yes, the 'the real investment is in alt coins' stance! 
It's definitely important to diversify your portfolio by investing alt coins because as any sound investor will tell you, alt coin prices are totally independent of bitcoin prices. 
/s just in case it's needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:11:35
Yea I'm totally with you. Tf is this dude talking about? If he were correct in his

Oh, well when you put it like that... it still sounds retarded.

I mean, let's be honest. They'll probably be out of business by then. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:40:56
You're right man. You fuckers not touching your bitcoin wallets absolutely equals warrior fighting throughout history with swords and shit. Christ you people are a joke. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:20:22
It's people like you that make me so incredibly happy with every fucking dollar that falls of the bitcoin price. Smug cunts who have convinced themselves that they are the lone geniuses in a sea of morons. You're right. Everyone is stupid, and you're an enlightened technological fortune teller. I hope you follow your advice and invest eevvveerryyy single penny you've got in it. Have fun and enjoy the ride. Douchebag. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:23:03
Hahahahaha then everyone in the grocery store clapped, and Satoshi descended from the heavens and thanked you for your bravery and undying loyalty yes?

Any day now. I just took out my third mortgage on my apartment to buy more. See you on Saturn.

So if you did have fiat available... you would have used it instead?
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:23:32
Ah yes. Currency of the future. All about the technology eh?
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:19:01
Well, then you're being willfully ignorant. Which is quite sad tbh. 'Just a series of bubbles... just how it works'.... yikes. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:24:11
Shit. So THATS why I just saw on the news that every credit/debit card company went simultaneously bankrupt this morning. That explains it. Because until now, I was a tad confused. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:10:11
Ah yes. More solid economic advice from *nice*. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:57:43
Wait wait wait. So, what you're saying is, to ensure your bitcoin is safe, you have to follow all those steps? So, you can honestly say that the regular Joe-shmo can 1) know how to do that and 2) would actually not be lazy enough to actually do that? I'm sorry, but if you think that's actually possible then you're kidding yourself. This right here is another perfect example of why bitcoin will absolutely never be 'the current of the future.' It's just not possible. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:59:03
That doesn't matter though right? Who cares what the low is because it's not about making money, it's about the tech. Right guys? ....Right....?
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:10:42
Dude. You sound fucking delusional. Also, the Bernie quote is a lovely finish. Gotta love it.

@_date: 2018-02-02 19:30:57
Lol wut? Whatever keeps the shotgun out of your mouth man.... but I think you and I both know that's complete horse shit. Greed my man. Greed is what brought people to bitcoin. Which is A ok with me. Just don't pretend you or anyone else is some shining beacon of nobility with solely altruistic motivations begging your bitcoin purchases. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:36:10
Well shit. TIL how to get Margery to stop talking to me. Do you have a specific service you recommend? Because I'd do anything to get this bitch to stop talking to me, but I'm not about to marry some b-list bride.

Because he's trying to show how much he knows about economics by making sure that everyone knows that he read on a buzzfeed article once that it wasn't one of the original categories for a nobel prize. It's very of him. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:25:32
No no, you misunderstand! Everyone here doesn't care about fiat! They will just HODL forever. No matter what. If bitcoin went to 100,000 'ponzi scheme usd' tomorrow not a single one of them would sell because they believe in the technology^tm  .  
This place man... I love coming in here. Endless entertainment. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:40:13
Hahahahahaha you think that technical analysis you just learned from a fucking YouTube video gave you the keys to unlocking and accurately predicting bitcoin's movement? Yikes. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:37:18
Poor Buffett. I hate that he lost all of his money right at the new millennium. And his non-existent returns on his investments from 2000-today show that you can't teach a 20th century dog 21st century tricks. /s
 
When you're confused why your friends and co-workers enjoy the times when bitcoin decreases in value, and you lose money and proceed to rub it your face, think back to comments like this. This is why. If I had someone at work talk non-stop about the revolutionary bitcoin in one breath, and in that same breath proceed to tell me that Warren fucking Buffett doesn't know anything about the economy... id absolutely talk endless amounts of shit to them every single time bitcoin fell. You dudes are insufferable.

Ah the classic 'instead of making a point, stating my opinion, and backing it with empirical evidence, I'll recommend a book that other smart people have recommended' method. You should publish a paper. I'm sure the peer review will be a blast.

You think someone who has interests in investing in traditionally financial systems in addition is a paid shill for 'the banking system' whatever entity that is..? 
Let me rephrase my question. You *honestly* think some big banks are paying people a salary to go on cryptocurrency subreddits, and post positive sentiments regarding traditional investing in the hopes that you take your massive 500 dollar bitcoin investment, and instead invest it in their funds/stocks? 
You, are fucking delusional.

@_date: 2018-02-23 04:52:52
Dude your quotes around *nobel* is more telling about your lack of knowledge than any of this other nonsense that you're spewing everywhere. It's such an thing to do that I'm legitimately embarrassed for you. It's just like, such a pedantic non-issue that you're just showing everyone how little you know by trying to make certain that you're aware that you know it wasn't one of the original categories. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:05:44
Yup and the dude isn't doing himself any favors as the top comment pointed out [This video]( could have saved him a shitload of time, money and heartache. I highly recommend every watch it. Even if you never plan on getting arrested, this is information every single person needs to know.

To those of you that actually believe this nonsense... your unquenchable desire to believe in every aspect of anything related to bitcoin has blinded you. If you saw a story that was half as absolutely made up and as ridiculous as this a year ago.... this dude would be hovering around -180 vice +180.
