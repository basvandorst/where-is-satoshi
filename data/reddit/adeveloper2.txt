So what would happen if this keeps happening over the generations? Would we run out of bitcoins?

Bitcoin is finite right? What happens if somebody dies and never gave away his wallet credentials.

You hold it and then sell? A big part of the hype with bitcoin appears to be not that it is a digital currency but that it is increasing rapidly in value w.r.t. other currencies.

I am not a player. Just want to ask - whats the incentive to buy stuff with bitcoin when its value is increasing constantly at least for now?
