Late 2012, early 2013. Sub $30/bitcoin.

Financially it is doing fine. Most of the revenue was derived from fixed income. Private stock trading was very difficult to get traction just because companies had the right of first refusal, if they didn't want their shares sold.
It seems like the bitcoin trading seems to be lucrative for the time being.

I worked at Secondmarket from 2010 - 2012, they have really pivoted from what they were originally doing...

Because Barry was not a great CEO. He hired heavily into private company trading, and fixed income trading didn't require any additional bandwidth (concentrated market, so an extra trader would be a drag on revenue due to diminishing marginal returns).
Since the private company stock market was almost exclusively trading Facebook, when they went public we didn't need 25 traders to do the work on 3 people could do.

Yeah pretty much. He was a terrible ceo anyway.

Sure. They originally started out called "Restricted Stock Partners," where they were acting as a broker dealer for private companies who wanted to trade their private company stock. We actually helped author parts of the JOBs act that helped make it easier for private companies to remain private and take on new investors, as well as make it easier to go public. Really revolutionary stuff, but unfortunately a little too ahead of it's time.
They also traded a lot of fixed income instruments that were primarily involved in the financial crisis (think ABS, SLARs, MBS, Warrants, etc.)
While fixed income trading was a primary revenue generator, we made a lot of money off Facebook stock, which caused a problem when they went public (they had to lay off 30% of the company).
One of the initiatives I was working on before I left was setting up funds collatorized by non traditional financial assets (think wine, chocolate, watches, art, etc.) 
Shortly after that Barry became interested in Bitcoins (like really interested), he would send emails to employees saying people should invest in these, and he personally would buy significant amounts of them, with financial backing from investors.
From what I understand (I still have some friends that work there), Barry wanted to focus on Bitcoin investments, so he stepped down as CEO and worked on setting up this trust.
Um that's all I can think of off hand, but happy to answer other questions if people have any.
