Let's not kid ourselves.  This guy was greedy which is how he got burned.  He was trying to turn 1 digital BTC to 1 cascascius coin BTC which is worth A TON MORE than a regular old BTC.

Even if GHash.io pinky promises never to double spend or do harm to the network , the fact that they have 51% means they can be TAKEN OVER by a malicious 3rd party who then instantly has control over 51% of the network and nothing to do with the promises Ghash.io made.

"So effective today we're reducing instant buy limits to 1 BTC on level 2 accounts, and 0.1 BTC on level 1 accounts. The regular limits (for non-instant buys) will stay the same for now (50 BTC and 10 BTC respectively), although we may need to move all our rates over to being set in your local currency in the near future (the price of bitcoin is changing so quickly)."

I can use this to hedge a free bet against bitcoin OR USD then in a no lose situation, leaving yourself open for huge losses.
Makes no sense that ANYONE would do that unless they were trying to scam people for BTC since "if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is" and that applies here perfectly.

No excuse to make a customer wait that long.  Even 1 day turnaround is too long when working in the BTC world if you ask me.
We are still getting scammed every day, and services are too slow.

Genereally though most people will do the free credit reporting or monitoring for 1 year and decide not to pay the additional $14.95 a month after, and that is when the hackers with all the data needed step in, just because the math says they have a better chance the longer they wait.

It appears that P2Pool is almost it's own protocol that implements a "min blockchain" to show its proof of work and pay out to each miner based on their own protocol, that then hooks in to the main blockchain.
Thankfully there are a lot smarter people than me working on BTC, but I can't possibly imagine how it could  be "baked" into the original code at this point without disrupting the original blockchain, thus negating every single previous coins position in the public ledger.

No one can do returns in BTC otherwise they can use it as a free hedge against the market.
It must be returned in USD equivalent, otherwise as soon as the price shoots up everyone would return all their products for BTC.

The thing that makes me really mad right now, is the bank in WA knew about the fraud since Wed the 29th of January, and they still have not filed a police report as of 12AM EST when I talked to them today, 5 days later.
Not sure how much more public information I would even feel comfortable giving out if a criminal investigation will be pending.

So glad I got all my shit out of there a long time ago when it all started going down.

Which raises the price for all people.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:36:14
All you have ever done is lie, and try and lower the price so you can buy more.  Not that original, and just makes you a liar and a bad human being.  Is it worth it to be considered a shitty human and liar?
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:31:45
Lots of people are clueless about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:17:31
I feel unless Blizzard accepts BTC for their products, they have no right regulating a tournament with BTC prizes because they clearly don't consider it money.  They can't get their cake and eat it too, for nothing.

Started mining June 2011 on my CPU for a few months.  Mined nearly everyone of them since, and sold all my GPU hardware last summer.
I used a lot of them though to get all my of usenet, torrent, VPN, seedbox accounts.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:16:33
So incredibly dumb to use Paypal for BTC.  How many examples do you really need of people getting screwed?
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:49:20
100% spot on.

He is right though, this has been answered at least 100 times and you fucking suck.

*Next week* is the same as BFL's *Two Weeks.  
You haven't been following the whole thing where CampBX has said "next week" for the last 2 months on their ACH. 
Hate to say it, because I really want them to impliment it also.

Jesus... you don't need network access, or SMS, or internet access on your phone to use the Google Authenticator..................

Doesn't it directly compete with their Google Wallet services that they have been heavily pushing the last month?
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:14:20
It is difficult, and most people can't do it or have the desire to.  I still recommend waiting for 1 confirmation on anything over $10 especially since the system is not automated.

Only thing killer about it, is how dead it is in terms of functionality and what it brings to the table that similar programs do not.
This is not the app, we were looking for.
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:56:32
He  is referring to central bankers as the pool operators here.................  Saying they would be destroying their own currency (btc).
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:43:25
Like all others have said, use bitpay or coinbase and you have literally nothing to lose.  It is truly a win/win for you.

I just have a difficult time sending new miners to BTC Guild since they are just so big already.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:03:14
They purged my account for inactivity..  
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:48:45
No, but my point is stating within the last year and a half they took a 20% decrease, which is NEW to Apple based on people realizing they are overpriced, restrictive, and offer less than each and every one of their counterparts and competition.

Which is why you trade on BTCchina if you are looking to increase (or lose) your BTC but not fiat.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:07:02
Are you joking?  I can't tell if you literally know nothing about btc, or are just trolling.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:49:34
You don't get it.  The more they buy, the more people will want it, and the value will go up.  BTC can be divisible by an infite numbers.  They are coded in to go past .0000000000000.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:27:13
Well in August 2010 there in fact was a hack to the protocol that let a user create 180 billion+ bitcoins and required a hard fork on the network (which took a lot of blocks) to correct. 
So yes, even if there is a hack to the standard protocol, the brilliance of the blockchain is people can correct it even after the action.
The code is truly out of this world, I have never seen anything like it before.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:58:20

Bitpay.com means he takes zero risk and gets cash at the end of the day, as well as accepting btc.
Nothing to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:29:28
Use craigslist to accept BTC or $, and then turn it to BTC if not..
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:18:28
Just drawing an imagniary line doesn't count.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:04:42
I am not a professional in any aspect, but I do recognize that you need professional help on a few levels.  First, you clearly have an addictive personality towards gambling, and you need to admit that and accept it for what it is and seek help.
After that, you need to also "man up" to your sister and tell her that you love her and messed up, bad.  You are young enough where this will not end either of your lives, but if you continue this path, you will either kill yourself or want to be dead, and we never want to lose any friends.
Please seek professional help and start rebuilding the remaining family you have based on trust, not lies.
Good luck, you can do it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:11:34
Import the wallet.dat to blockchain.info and have access to the coins instantly.  Then send them to coinbase and sell it directly and the $ goes to your bank account.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:00:43
I still love blockchain.info, what can I say.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:09:31
Yeah.. coindesk also promoted inputs.io and that worked out great.  Even the guy making the first comment on the website knew more than these guys.
Not sure I could ever go back to the coindesk.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:41:31
That is how you lose money quick.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:17:58
Ok, the only reason to get in to mining at this point is  that it is actually a fun hobby and it makes sure you keep up with all the bitcoin news.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:43:43
Is it there yet or what?
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:26:41

Trading = yes.
Getting $ out after the trade = no.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:10:27
Ummm the transaction is published to the network instantly...  Just need a block for confirmation.
Can't tell if you are serious, or dumb still.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:30:46
Yeah, this is 100% not what he wrote the first time.  Notice the little * next to the comment up there.
He had it written like a drunk 14 year old girl before and I stand by my point.

Mine is not verified and I deposit and withdrawn BTC from Gox no problem.  All within the last month.

But you wont' post the text of it here so we can verify there is a problem on their end and not yours?  Seems fishy.

Do not listen to this guy.  I am not the biggest coinbase fan now that they took away my instant coins, but it is far and away the best for purchase a few thousand dollars worth of bitcoins.
Coinbase really is a good service overall.  I like how  he says to do "anything", yet provides no examples.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:42:56
Dude.... 2 factor authentication.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:23:16
I have had it both ways over the last few weeks.  Sometimes when I send to my blockchain wallet it is instant, the other times it has taken a few hours and it is really frustrating.
Still like coinbase for purchasing though.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:53:41

You mean him shilling up Quark after being given a fuck ton of them as pre-mined wasn't a way to build credibility?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:10:00
It is the standard and precedent setter.  I am always amazed with how good Coinbase truly is.
@_date: 2013-10-24 11:30:41

Wow.  Just wow......  Really?  I mean... are you living in Nazi Germany during hte 30's?
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:30:55
For small amounts blockchain.info is as good as it gets, and they never touch the private key, meaning it is as safe as you make it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:18:41
You mean for tax write offs?
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:33:22
Maybe like... give people the option?
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:27:34
Keep my BTC in BTC or I won't play.  Fuck transferring my USD right away.  I am staying far away until that changes, or I will never come.
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:32:07
The actual wallet resides in the appdata folder, so you can't just uninstall it.  You have to manually delete it, by choice. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:30:01
Yes the quark devs gave him a shitload of the premined coins to promote it.
Made me lose all respect for Max.a
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:19:07
Why find a buy for less than you paid?  And why is this the most upvoted comment because of that?
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:38:55
That sounds awesome for local people, but is shipping a tree really worth it?  That does sound sweet though.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:27:22
You mean 50, not 10.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:46:30
Who the fuck cares....  This is allowed and Mt. Gox ENCOURAGES IT.  
If you look, there was zero lag during this time so stop bitching.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:37:19
Double spend is easy as shit and costs nothing if done properly.  Just need to make sure to do it before a block is found.  It just invalidates the first xfer, not truly a "double spend."
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:38:33
And then you will see 12 blocks in 1 minute with 11 of them being orphaned.

I love spending my bitcoins.  I actually get giddy when the transaction finishes as soon as I click send.  I also love hearing that "BEEP" when I get my dividends on Wed or when I get payments for items.

@_date: 2013-11-21 16:56:43
If you read enough you should actually be comfortable storing small amounts on wallets such as blockchain.info extension since you control the private keys and with 2FA it is a sure thing.
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:33:55
Everytime I tried to prediect a crash and buy back in, I lose my ass off.  I am a spend/hold type of guy now.

@_date: 2013-11-14 14:30:58
Don’t you need to give this program or entity full access to your API keys do use that?  Wouldn't that mean they can actually perform any trade or withdrawal they want once you enter your keys to trade using a 3rd party?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:36:18
Good thing I wont have to think about it and can just scan the QR of the item, verify I agree to pay whatever price, and then move on.

So there is your logic, sorry it was so difficult for you to understand. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:37:11
I have had zero fee transfers take up to 3 hours on the busiest of days, although theoretically it could take a lot longer.

Sorry,  I live in US.  Thank you for the reply.
I have traded a total of $200 worth that I mined myself over the last two  years, and I took out the money through dwolla.  
Aside from that, they require ALL accounts to be verified (everything needed for identity theft) if you want to use their service at all now (put new money in or take money out, even $1.00)

No it just says the "next step" to verifying your account is a credit card.  There is another step after that.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:27:35
Check the transaction on blockchain.info and see if a fee was included.  It will also give you an estimate of when it will confirm.

But who truly owns them if they are not in your posession and you do not have the private key?
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:36:10
All good, disable SMS and enable Authenticator as soon as possible though.  Also make sure you enable 2FA on your gmail account too, and anything else with stored BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:14:18
Please, sell me all your coins then.

I remember reading a paper from one of the greats, stating he predicted at least three big crashes with each rebound greater than the next.
I should look for that paper.

I personally use a blockchain.info wallet to hold my BTC using 2 factor authentication.
When I want to buy BTC in t he US, I buy them using coinbase.com.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:17:46
You can buy all of that with btc now....  all of it.

Bitcoin history right here, and well deserved.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:41:49
Use coinbase, their competition and maybe it will wake them up.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:04:11
So you already emailed them, and they stated they won't honor the request before you turned into a big douche bag?  Even you state you have used them many times with no problems, but now that there is an issue... you bitch to everyone instead of talking to the company?
Fuck off you entitled little shit.  Come back when they deny it flat out and I will join you in the boycott, but fuck you until then.
And then double fuck you for begging for upvotes.  Scum.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:42:05
Why pay the fee daily when you can pay weekly?  I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:54:09
Dude, you got in the game at the biggest upswing and wanted to get everything instant?  Also, you are in USA using Mt. Gox which proves you have no idea about bitcoin or any of the exchanges.
If you are in the USA use coinbase and you would have already had your coin price locked in.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:09:33
Pretty sure the BTC wagon is still going to be rolling for at least another 5 years in the early adaptors phase.  
Why do you think you missed it?

@_date: 2013-12-05 20:34:30
Yeah but you already cashed out more than you put in... so why are you actually saying?  Should you not be negative since you cashed out more then you put in, based on their mistake?
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:51:12
Or you can look at the chart, news, adoption rate, and realize that yeah it actually happened just like he said.

I was able to withdraw last week without any verification.  But I have had my account for over 2 years and have traded thousands worth, so maybe they didn't need verification for BTC only for me.

Not a bad analogy.  I don't keep BTC in my coinbase after I buy it though.  I keep everything under my own control.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:16:29
Either you are delusional or insane.
I have been mining since 2010 and buying BTC all along the way, as well as being a 3 year member on btf, but you are fucking nuts. 
I believe in BTC as much or more than anyone, but you are fucking nuts!
(I hope I am wrong)
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:44:32
Just buy btc.........
Why would anyone sell you a miner that makes money when they could do it themselves?
And if that is the case, the company will 100% always mine with them until the ROI isn't there, call it a "burn in test" and fuck you in the ass.
What is wrong with you?

I'm hyped too because I actually read the code, the whitepaper, and understand the concept.  This is something more and more people are getting hyped about because they are taking time to understand it.

Hi, Mike.  I can't access the site from where I am at so I am sure this has been answered a bunch of times sorry about that.
But getting money in to VoS from a US bank, what is the best way for that?  Again, I apologize for you answering this for the millionth time. 
Thank you,

Is this open source?  Last week someone got hacked for having a program just like this and he only had 2 closed source bitcoin apps on his phone, lost a bunch of BTC.

You are clearly not a programmer or developer, because that is the opposite of how we think.

And a million steps too many.  Only need 2 steps.  Take wallet.dat and incorporate it to blockchain.info and you will have access to the wallet in 1 minute.

Not at all...  We can't emulate a stock split and double the 21m coins to make 42m, and just double the value of whatever we have.
Nothing like a stock split.

The wallet is stored on your userdata directory on windows, not the install directory.

There are already multiple open source trading bots that have verified and trusted users, not from people who just made their account a few hours ago and some how know enough about trading margins on BTC sites, yet not enough to know that a "trading bot isn't illegal".

I got this yesterday sending from blockchain.info.  My fees are set to always be included but for some reason I sent .05 to my brother and it showed up in his wallet instant, but with no confirmations.  It then took 6 hours to confirm even though my wallet was set to include a fee.
I was pissed.

As well they should be able to.

No the private keys are generated using Java and they don't touch the server, and if you use the extension they are generated directly on your end.
Of course anything can be attacked by malware... i don't get that if you have something logging your keys, you are screwed no matter what.  But I use 2FA and lastpass and have never typed my PW in anywhere.
I also use the blockchain.info wallet app and keep less than $10k on it, and use that for all my purchases.  The blockchain.info wallet app was susceptible to the Android RNG that was addressed months ago.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:38:04
It's easy to believe as bitstamp has been down for 6 hours...

It should not hit the blockchain as the checksum should invalidate it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:05:48
7-11, coffee shops, and other small time purchases are the ideal place to use 0 confirmation receives because it is not worth the time or effort to "fake double spend" a $2.00 transaction, while it greatly or completely eliminates the ~$0.20 fee to process a $2.00 buy.

Well your heart is in the right place and I apologize for being rude, but still after re-reading this it appears you did not perform proper due diligence before you started throwing decent chunk of $$ around, or you could have seen these issues discussed in the past, and of the various problems coinbase is having.
Really though, you got into the game at the last minute (relativity speaking) and wanted everything instant. 
I respect your desire to learn about this, but I think reading everything about it before just tossing in a lot of money to a few random exchanges and playing the long game instead of trying for a quick buck is better in the long run, but each person’s money is their own to do with as they please.
Good luck with everything and hope this gets worked out!

For the love of god, why insult the man with $0.11 and then VERIFY.  Only verify $1+ or more if you have any class, whatsoever.  You have no idea what the verify string does... AND you verified in the r/bitcoin WHICH IS WORTHLESS and more of a strain than anything becuase we obviously know about bitcoin.
First tip I ever downvote.

Unlike other people on here, I properly secure my wallet on blockchain.info using 2FA and don't keep more than 10 coins on it at a time.  I never lose sleep becuase I think  my BTC will be stolen.
I love the blockchain.info wallet and phone application for Android.

You don't understand anything you are talking about, do you?

Hey, Lentil I always listen to you and like what you say, but there is really no way I would do this on an untrusted poker site, when I already do that same thing on bitstamp and Gox, granted I pay .02% each time I do it, but that feels safer to me using a tried and true site.

Once is an exchange, one is not..  Coinbase uses its own algorithm which is unknown, to establish their price.  It probably has to do with which exchange they have money in at the time they can make the purchase with, while taking a hidden profit, while taking the known 1% fee, plus the $.15 bank fee.

Ok good stuff.  Yes, I realize that an item that was once really cheap and is now expensive even though they have no track record for shipping or delivering anything, means there will be exactly 0 new sales until they readjust or actually ship something.

I still don't understand.  
For potential example, you see items on the shelf you want.  You scan the QR.  It instantly tells you the $ equivalent value as well as doing a search for all other nearby merchants, as well as searching online for the same product and best deal.
This is possible.

$.10 tips are too cheap and don't go through anymore.  $.25 minimum or you are costing more in transaction fees...
I mean $.10 though?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:36:15
Look on  too.  I sell there from over 30,000 credit unions across the United States at .05% above bitstamp (one of the cheapest on the whole site), which would be currently $60 cheaper than Gox.  $20 less than Gox isn't too bad actually.
Lots of good traders there, and good peoplel to meet if you want to go down that route too.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:08:46
People were still trading them at $1.00, so they were never worthless even at that price.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:21:44
Don't get me wrong I was the king of cheap ass tips before they banned them too =)
I mean free money is free money, but in this instance the fee eats up all the xfer, hence they had to up the min amount tipped to $.25.
All good, yo!
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:19:51
THATS IT.  IM OUT OF BITCOIN.  SEEYA

Check your gmail.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:38:44
I agree.  It is total shit if you are using blockchain.info app on android once you hit the button to buy with bitcoins.
It resulted in me taking a long time to properly copy the address (since the highlight goes away instantly you can't copy it easy), and then having to copy the exact bitcoin amount too.  
I have used Gyft multiple times and it worked great once I had the items, but the interface is total shit on Android and needs a major overhaul before I use it again.
I still like Gyft a lot though and what they are doing.

It's been a "bubble" since 2011...
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:12:22
Well honestly no one gives a crap about the currency ZAR which you traded as that is only about $94,000 which is much different than $1,000,000.

In the same manner that "guns don't kill people, people kill people", I would say "people feed people", but bitcoin and you Jason are just a wonderful and amazing means of how to do it.
I think the good people of this community would be helping others out of the kindness of their heart even if BTC didn't exist.  It sure does make it easier to help people though, no matter what their geographic location is.  Truly amazing!

Oh fuck nevermind, here we go again it looks like.....
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:54:35
The "free money" days are over.  No miner is worth the ROI.  Just use the money you would spend on a miner and buy straight up BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:19:43
Just look at the blockchain yourself.....  all bitcoin transactions are public and you can see if it is forward on or not yourself..

There are whales on the bitcoin forum who will fly out to meet you in person for semi large transactions like this.  
Usually they are talking in millions, but for $200k they might make the trip.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:56:02
Except in April there was only 1 exchange, and now there are 7+ and they are all moving around the same price except in China, which is way higher still.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:26:18
Nice!  With day trading BTC that $100USD will turn to $40USD real quick, if you are lucky.
And if you end up not so lucky, you will most likely be trading away your first male child.
Either way, you are fucked.

Just take the wallet.dat and upload it to blockchain.info and have access to it instantly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:08:21
This was polled months ago is why.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:55:09
You have a long way to go.  Buy bitcoins on coinbase.com and get a wallet on blockchain.info, if you want.
If money is tight, I would not recommend buying.

I do honestly think BTC is still the best investment you can make, even today.

Until the 3 blocks, yeah.  Then it went through as it should.

@_date: 2013-12-23 14:06:31
You could send them to an email address using coinbase.com, and he can then move them to his own wallet that he creates.
I have done this with many people to spread the love.

Because they are actually making and producing thousands of the chips themselves, and then housing them in low cost power units in India and China.
It is not for any individual anymore.  I miss mining on all my 5830's, but that time is long gone.  Even personal ASICs are money thrown away.

@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:19
That is what someone who already owns millions of $ worth and wants to sell them to everyone, would say.  And exaclty the reason not to listen to anyone like you giving "advice".
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:45:30
If someone convinces you to use something other than Coinbase has ulterior motives.  It turns it to cash right away, and you get your first $1m in sales for free.

Either way, thank you Gavin for the work you are doing for the community and BTC as a whole.

@_date: 2013-12-04 15:50:30
Well they are doing the BTC community a huge disfavor by taking BTC for wikipedia when they clearly don't want it.
What would ever give them incentive to take BTC when bitpay is giving them the cash straight away?
Bad move on their part and they need to stop it.

That is crazy.  During the crash, and the announced time Mt Gox was to go back online, my internet was fucking just dead.  Only at the exact time it was to go back online.  Then, 30 minutes later everything was back perfect but the price dropped over $60 from when my internet died to getting back on.
I thought someone was out to get me, for real.

After smoking for ~14 years I was able to quit by using an e-cig and dropping my nicotine mg every month or two.  I loved that e-cig.  
I tried about 4-5 of them over the course of 2 years and the best of the best was called "The Darwin".  I have since stopped using that also and am completely smoke and nic free thanks to e-cigs.

Don't day trade but if you are, do it on BTCchina since they are the only exchange in the world with 0% fees right now, plus they have the highest market.
Or use bitstamp.

Well your wife is smarter than you already since she doesn't want you to mine, even if it is for the wrong reasons!

I have been using BTC for 3 years, and still love my blockchain.info wallet over all the others on my computer.

He is saying if you had them for free also it is worth mining... if you have to buy them, the value is instantly gone and you will never ROI.

OK, hard to argue with a dumb brick wall, but it's not a fucking web wallet as you have full control over it IN ANY FUCKING CLIENT.
Wow, the dumb is strong in this one.  Love how you keep arguing your dumb stupid point.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:57:59
Yeah no problem I have recommended this to countless people and each and every one of them got the coins they thought were lost.  Good stuff!

It will drop when the black market thief sells his 96,000 coins, and then is murdered.

Thank you for citing your source of information!......

I have the 7970 also and have never been ab le to get it to run at the full potential.  There are tons of forum posts saying it doesn't work on the 7970.

When they started the design and production of these units, I am thinking ASIC's were still imaginary.

Jesus, 4 weeks to a month!?.........
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:28:20
Good stuff.

What is the address registered on the site?  And did you transfer ownership on the site so people know you aren't bullshitting?

Just  backup your wallet.dat file and hold it offline, or encrypt it and email it to yourself.
Tons of ways to backup your wallet to make sure the coins are never lost.

"hacked" lol.  They never relased any information they only said they were hacked once and were done with it.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:02:04
Such bullshit!  You have done advanced BTC aspects such as generating a vanity address and signing PGP, yet can't send anything?  Telling people it is going to charity then not sending when it means most is kind of crappy.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:35:53
I use blockchain.info for wallets with less than $10k.  Wallets with more than that should be on paper in a fireproof/waterproof safe.
There are a few ways to secure large amounts, but small amounts blockchain.info is as good as it gets with 2FA enabled.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:59:07
Good luck, that is truly bullshit if it does down like you stated.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:27:19
What about sending to an exhange likt BTC china or Bitstamp from one address, and withdrawing to a fresh one?  Does that work?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:13:05
The date on the bank account needs to be within two months and they are VERY strict on this so why are you saying that?
@_date: 2013-07-05 12:30:45
Theoritical increase......  big difference.

Coinbase has been great for me.
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:42:40
Ok, you still don't undertand how or what I was saying so here is the depressing facts.   
Take the BTC you paid for it.
Take all the BTC you will ever make for it.
Do the math.  Then look at where I said "You will get .0001, total... maybe.".  Sorry bud, you got F'd.
I hate to say it, you will never "even if I can get one ill be happy"...
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:22:55
Ya know, the public blockchain...
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:39:34
Or feel free to do your own research. 
"Max Keiser + quark" = first result..... 
I will only give you one more basic free internet lessons if you want before I start charing you 1mBTC each!.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:15:08
No.  That is a type of wallet as well as many other things.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:38:55
Don't listen to sqig.  It very well could ruin it if not monitored and used properly and it will for sure decrease the life of anything that is mining, by a long shot.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:13:31
This just makes no fucking sense...  You have 1 wallet with your identification, and 1 wallet with your credit cards and cash?
Yeah, I love BTC and all but you are a fucking liar.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:20:23
Thing is, with credit unions you don't have complaints like you do with shitty banks...  so that clears itself up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:50:32
You missed the 'abutt' in your username right after "fucking".
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:07:58
This is great but I love my bitcoin tip extension I already had that uses nerdfighters script.
Either way, good stuff.
