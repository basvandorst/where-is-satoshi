BOFA screws over people to the tune of 1.3 trillion annually in fees/penalties and those folks gladly announce who they bank with. 
My point.
Regulations aren't worth shit if the regulators are the foxes themselves, which is almost always the case.

Randomly, I will tell you that the rule in not posting your bitcoin addy predated changetip by quite a bit. Although early on, it was allowed....I think. right guys, i'm getting fucking old and CRS.

I found two 3 year old UK articles all using the same source. Mentioning wasting funds on 1800 pounds for business cards, and 80 pounds for photographic politicians...
Im thinking paying editors is a huge no no in itself, and then I also see the problem of growing staff and expenses and all that too. It's complex.
I use wikipedia often to get a general idea of overview for things and feel like its my duty to give back. But that money doesn't go to the content creators... Sorta like Reddit in some ways....except Reddit still had ads, and wikipedia does not.
 I see both points. Thanks for binging that to my attention. I will watch that closely!

Today its just medic mobile! But look out for future charities. 
Just an FYI, many charities use on-chain processors that have a min fee of .001 BTC (the same as these tips) and also require you to identify your self with personal info and fill out a form. I am willing to do that, but in order to prove I tipped for every person - it will require me to fill out a form and pay a fee each time (PITA and expensive and wasteful). Or pay all at once and create a system for tracking each person who asks me to tip to charity. (More work)

Hi buddy!
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:58:01
Today its just medic mobile! But look out for future charities. 
Just an FYI, many charities use on-chain processors that have a min fee of .001 BTC (the same as these tips) and also require you to identify your self with personal info and fill out a form. I am willing to do that, but in order to prove I tipped for every person - it will require me to fill out a form and pay a fee each time (PITA and expensive and wasteful). Or pay all at once and create a system for tracking each person who asks me to tip to charity. (More work)
I will tip to charity in your behalf. Too number 20!

I will look into it! It's through bitpay and I have to give quite a bit of personal info in order to donate. I would have to make a running tally of the donations and then tip all at once.  I will keep it in the running for another opportunity for sure. thank you!

the BBB makes Yelp look like a saint. Its a fucking scam. BBB welcomes complaints, takes them to the business, tells the business to pay 150 bucks, and makes the complaints go away.
If you so choose to get nuclear...You need to file with the attorney generals office of [consumer protection for wherever they are based out of.](
Specifically the [Fraud department](
But you need to exhaust all avenues and document all of that first before hand.
NINJAEDIT: I dont know where they are based out of. Nor do I know if you case warrants this nuclear action.

**Any feedback? What am I doing wrong or right? Any idea for a charity that takes bitcoin over twitter next. I like using twitter because its easy to verify multiple tips and I'm usually on a mobile.  But open to all ideas. I could use chain transactions and tip a batch at once, otherwise the .001  fee kills multiple small tips. Let me know!**

I sent this yesterday.
 
I currently am a monthly giver to your organization and have been for some time.
I have more bitcoin than cash. I have asked before, but please think about accepting bitcoin for donations (at least in your USA department).
The times are more urgent than ever with your work in West Africa.
 
Here are partial list of charities that already accept bitcoin
 
 
 
 
Also, places as big as Wikipedia accept bitcoin (I just donated bitcoin to them yesterday)
 
Money exchangers who take absolutely no fee are as follows.
1, 
 
2, 
 
The Wikimedia foundation consulted a lawyer about accepting bitcoin, they seem to be a rather open organization, perhaps contacting them would give you further insight?
 
If you are even slightly interested, I would donate my time to giving you more information. Bitcoin and another cryptocurrencies love to donate and give to charities.
Here is an article detailing some of this 
 
Please, I beg of you to take this to your next appropriate meeting and give it a try! I will personally spearhead a campaign for donations in bitcoin if you so choose to implement it down the line.
 
Thanks for your time!

Review of Nachos
First of all, I'm reviewing nachos with real cheese. If you can scoop cheese, its not cheese.
Nachos are deliscious. Make sure the tortilla chips are salty and fresh. The flavor combinations cannot be matched and nachos are a excellant sharing appetiziers. I do have one complaint, they get messy and I have found a good percentage of woman will not eat them on a first date...so save the nacho order for the 3rd or 4th date to be sure.
Purest nacholovers just want tortilla chips and cheese. But some folks want the whole nacho (sour cream, olives, green onion, carne asade, beans, cheese, are just some of the potential toppings on a deluxe order of nachos)
 
So their you go, a review of nachos. In closure,
Beware someone who does not eat nachos.
You can send the bitcoin if i win, to coinbase/couchdive

I heard about bitcoin way before dogecoin. But dogecoin was my first crypto that I carried and cared about....WHY you ask?
Because they are nice, they help new users assertively, they are highly altruistic, they welcome new users....etcetera.
I have both bitcoin and dogecoin, more bit the doge though. I appreciate the seriousness and the hard work bitcoin has done, but bitcoin really needs to work on grabbing new user marketshare. Without doge's help, I probably would have never ended up here.

basically California and Kentucky need to grab sales tax from things bought with bitcoin.  
Here is the relevant data for California 
I think you can use your own shopping cart integration to apply sales tax/shipping and/or API spawn an exchange processor to charge the relevant amount shown with sales tax/shipping included or whatever.
(someone correct me if wrong or unclear)
Shopping cart - coinbase
Shopping cart - bitpay

Its understandable. Double spends aren't that common. Many places take things before first confirmation, but their is certainly risk. It seems many folks are working on solutions including side chains. 
And security is important but who really has been able to stop that? Visa essentially makes everyone pay so that they can cover loss plus make record profit. Many companies are working on solutions to this, but then theirs risk to that as well.
All valid points

If you think for one second that the FDIC will save you, your silly. 
The targets reserve rate for the FDIC is like 2.00% of all deposits. Currently, they only have .84 percent as of October '14.
They are mandated to be at 2 percent right now by the Dodd-Frank rule, but not only are they not increasing coverage, they are losing ground.

So if you think shit goes down and that having only .84 percent of the actual cash needed to cover a problem is adequate, well you must be a person of great faith.

BBB waits for complaint. BB contacts company and shakes your company down for membership fees, if you pay, the complaint goes away; if you don't, they post it on their website with a big D or F | once you pay, its an A.

AMnesty has no minimum donation. 
All charities do the suggested amount, but with a open field for you to type in any donation. It is a marketing trick for charities
You put 500 bucks, 200 bucks, 100 bucks, 75 bucks, 50 bucks, and 30 bucks on their in permanent fields . It makes most people go for donating the minimum number instead of maybe 10 bucks. There is a book about this somewhere, the title i forget.
But you can ALWAYS CLICK THE FIELD AND TYPE IN 2 dollars if you want.  They will take it

Before we even get to any of this shit...
Have you ever used Western Union? Because I have, and boy do I have a story for you!
Some teasers!!!
* Dirty shit filled diaper on the floor
* people fighting with a teller behind bullet proof glass
* Rude ass teller 
* angry mobs
* people crying over the 1 week 1168 percent short term loan stipulations they got themselves into
* screaming babies and children
* 8 people trying to cash checks and get money orders with only one rude ass teller
All this is because the current banking system abandoned them after milking them raw through overdraft fees and then kicked them to the curb. Now an entire predatory niche market has opened up to pray on them further.
I can send bitcoin with ~~5~~ 8 presses of my finger on my phone. I can convert bitcoin to cash with 7 presses of my fingers on a phone. 
Additionally, I have never sent my ID or utilitity bill to an exchange. Nobody fucking uses exchanges for fiat to crypto on normal exchanges.
Its localbitcoin which is anonymous. And then Circle or coinbase which verify through standard banking credit check and proprietary DB banking history subscriptions like ChexSystems.  Incidentally, probably the same DB that western union uses.
EDIT: I forgot the long ass Form filled with everything needed to steal my identity on it in front of 8 people and given to some clerk who makes 10 bucks an hour with high turnover.

If he finds it useful, that may spark his interest. If not, than it wasn't meant to be.

When the mining difficulty decreases due to loss of mining power overall, finding a block becomes easier.
 Bitcoin hummed along just fine with 1/1000 less mining power than now.
But....and this is a big but...
The retargeting event for difficulty in bitcoin is like every 2000 some odd blocks. Meaning if mining drops off quickly - it might take a very long time to find blocks and a very long time till the algorithm corrects itself by lowering the mining difficulty thereby making it easier for smaller mining operation to work and be possibly profitable.

Your theory is negligible. Bitcoin price is market based and the vast majority of its trading volume is in China. Bitcoins price is created by market demand, or currently, lack thereof. Currently, the Chinese stock market (Shanghai Composite) is taking off like a bat in hell and Chinese are selling bitcoin and getting back into the market.
 Hacking does not destroy coins or take them out of circulation anymore then stealing fiat does. 
The great hack that happened recently didn't move the market at all. Previous hacks or incidents even had a market upswing.
Hacking is not why bitcoin is priced lower recently.

you can't just elect yourself to get licensed in each state. Some states are easy, some are hard, some are impossible. States choose who they allow licensed.
This article is sensationalized... You think coinbase doesn't want to be licensed in every state? That they just snubbing States because they don't like them or some shit?

Maybe, I mean entire businesses can be bought in stock trades without fiat though.
The thing about bitcoin is that its a currency, that's acts like a commodity in market price, but also rides on a ledger system that could someday be the carrier for contracts, asset management, ticketing systems, crowdfunding, and decentralized markets.

I would love to, but I have to see about how get a feel for how much bitcoin this uses monthly. The small tips can add up, but I would love to find a way to reward those who pay it forward the most! It is about giving and that should be the goal! 
I like this project because even if we cant get folks enough to donate to a charity immediately, we expose people to bitcoin and they can see how easy it is to transfer monetary value over the blockchain. It is exciting times right now as more charities are starting to accept bitcoin and hopefully in the long run, people will choose to donate as these posts keep that idea in the forefront!

I've seen butters here, shit tons of alts, and people with no previous history here spreading this shit. 
If you like bitcoin XT go to that sub. If you like bitcoin stay here. If your down for both, go to both. 
The feeling of some is that bitcoin XT is not bitcoin and therefore off topic. Is this logic flawed? Very arguable. But the thing about Reddit and a free market is that you choose to be here..... or not.
Personally, whenever I see flare ups and tons of upvoted posts from people I have never seen here before calling for heads to roll. I get pissed. I do see some respected people arguing for changes and that has a lot more pull with me. The arguments are real, but the way this is headed is no way to do it.  Cleared concise arguments and dialogue are the way to sway

Nobody is going to let you use something they own to make more money than they could make - using it themselves.
The only way to ever make headway by mining is if bitcoin rapidly increases in value. That is, unless you are lucky enough to have a path to accessing the highest chip architectures from China on the cheap!

No, Read the sticky by theymos:
*"In the extremely unlikely event that the vast majority of the Bitcoin economy switches to XT and there is a strong perception that XT is the true Bitcoin, then the situation will flip and we should allow only submissions related to XT. In that case, the definition of "Bitcoin" will have changed. It doesn't make sense to support two incompatible networks/currencies -- there's only one Bitcoin, and serves only Bitcoin."*

Okay, was hoping for more action. I decided to just tip every charity mentioned so far a dollar. I sometimes tipped a charity 2 dollars, or amplified or doubled tips to pass them on.
I will have to go back to using the vote system though if this picks up.

Using the txID will forever show that one address sent another address crypto. 
To prove who those addresses belong gets more complicated. 
Almost all merchants generate an address with software that is looking for the correct value sent to it to finalize a purchase. After that, its standard email confirmation and fulfillment time.

A taxi passenger tapped the driver on the shoulder to ask him a question. The driver screamed, lost control of the car, nearly hit a bus, went up on the footpath, and stopped centimeters from a shop window. 
For a second everything went quiet in the cab, then the driver said, "Look mate, don't ever do that again. You scared the daylights out of me!" The passenger apologized and said, "I didn't realize that a little tap would scare you so much. "The driver replied, "Sorry, it's not really your fault. Today is my first day as a cab driver. I've been driving a funeral van for the last 25 years."

So you think having your birthday, name, address, usernames, passwords, gift cards, coinbase accounts all compromised is not bad. But having an easily replaceable credit card number would be too much.
Theze fucking corporations have it so fucking back asswards. I don't give one fuck about easily changible credit card numbers. I do give a fuck about my unchangible personal info.
Also noticeably absent was any mention of passwords being hashed. It appears, from the language, that they were plain text. If this was the case, then they provided no security at all and white frankly can't give one shit about their customers, which this announcement kind of displays.

I have never used gyft and I've never lost coins or assets to an exchange or a hack. I have signed up for gyft with fake info, but realized I don't have any fucking use to patronize the establishments they used.  I use bitcoin; I'm not shilling creditcards nor do carry them around or use them. I'm talking about company with shitty practices. Hashing credit card numbers is the fucking law and the bare minimum to be PCI compliant. This company, as do most others, only appears to have only done the bare minimum for security. I am not positive of that though as their announcement has shit for details.
I ask you,  If you had a mailing list of your friends or even strangers, would you post that shit all over the place, or feel some responsibility to keep it safe? All my important data is encrypted by choice.
I believe...as I stated, that companies should do more to protect consumers information if they require it for business, especially ones that tout themselves to the crypto community. Be it to guard against hackers or the fucking government. We need more security, not less, or some kind of apathetic acceptance that shitty data practices are okay.
I don't care if you don't care about your personal information. I care about my personal Information and I bet a lot of other folks do to. 
So that's our little difference and that's how it is I guess.

The phone owner set up 10 wrong pin tries and wipe feature. The wipe just wipes the private key. The data stays on the device, but can't be used. You can't mount the phone data to sandbox it as the encryption layer is hard pressed into the base level (some fancy phone techy acronym I don't remember)

The blockchain is a ledger, sorta like a pen and paper. You can write shit on that ledger. If you were stupid enough to collect a series of scripts written down on the blockchain and execute them...well you get what you deserve.

Yes. Rules on from who and how much.
But their are also loopholes. PACs aren't donating directly to a politician. They work with the presidential campaign committee for strategies and then 'independently' purchase ads and events that help the politicians without donating to them directly. Essentially its all bullshit. Furthermore, PACs can also do things that the politicians shouldn't like - dirty attack ads. The politician can then set aside responsibilities by blaming it on the PACs and not his campaign and play the good guy.

I'm glad you decided to make a reddit account to post this.
Much of the things you listed are hurdles created by federal regulation and fiat banking industry delays. I'm sure you know what ACH transfers are, that period of time you are waiting if for that. Once you make your first transaction and wait 30 days, the process should be much smoother for you on coinbase, and with further review - the instant limit amounts can be raised.
You might also check out circle while your are at it. It is a noticeable absence in your very detailed first post. But honestly - their KYC verification process is slow last I knew.
The federal regulation coupled with the slowness of the banking industry is troublesome, and a very real hurdle that hasn't appeared to go away so far. Its part of the reason bitcoin is a neat option in the long run - but also a thorn in its side as well.

I think it comes down to money. If they can make a transparent and trackable way to easily and quickly move figurative assets that are still able to be liquidated conventionally without paying other people to assist, watch, or scrape from to process,  then they gonna try.
They are throwing down money on it, and the interest is real. How it affects actual bitcoin is negligible.  All we can really do is sit back and see.

But for me, this isn't about that and I would not take part if it was. I was asked to take over when the previous person quit it. I asked many questions to make sure I was not getting myself into something I wouldn't agree with ethically.
The fact is, I like tipping and spreading crypto of all sorts, check my history. Probably 4 or 5 kinds of crypto tipped this week alone. When I do this thread, its about giving and that's it. 
I would love some recommendations to get some more action on here or to change it in a way that better serves the bitcoin community at large. So please chime in. 
 Mind you, as you can see, I haven't changed much besides adding a few more charities that people mentioned, a link to bitcoin talk charity thread, and took out some of the cheese. The change might be a slow process, but i am starting to get some extra time in my life; so now's a good time!

They are worth whatever the holder of the private blockchain or public market says it is depending on its use. It can still be represented as dollars transparently to the users.  The bank can use a blockchain to track the monies or holdings via tokens or whatever they decide, but display whatever they want to the users. It's really no different now. All the money stored at your local bank, doesn't really exist at that bank. It uses a ledger to keep track and asks for backfade from the feds if a huge patron requests a large liquidations in paper money.
My understanding is that the value in blockchain technologies is that it's a pain in the ass to track digital assets throughout the world and the block chain could provide a faster and more transparent ledger system for the trades if designed well. 
The other largely unmentioned benefit is that many trades and liquidations of holding requires use of many fee taking middlemen. The automatic clearing house system is not free as one pays network administration fees to use it, fraud protection analytics contractors like falcon are not free, bank agreements are not free. Its a chance for big money to keep more money; honestly I think thats the biggest motivator (as it is always)

It's odd actually. Spearphishing and asset loss is huge in the last 3 years. Just recently the FBI put out a warning to US businesses on the practice. 
The funny thing is, most common security tiers you place aren't affective for spearphishing.  Nobody wants to hem up management.

You can see A7 (sp?) use to tip me 5000 bits when I made the posts at first,. He doesn't at all lately and nothing is coming in on the back end anywhere else either. I've tipped 10 times that much on the large charity focused giveaways that I did. They have entirely abandoned this. I think the whole tipping Tuesday thing has is dying for the most part from them, but I could be wrong. I'm not super active on other platforms.
The first thing I will do is change the day, and I will go back out again to see what folks want to do with this via a poll or something. But you and others should not so quite when I ask. We need all views to make it better! Or maybe it should just die, I will make that an option too.

Sometimes stress tests are done to see how a network will handle the issues. Usually on a testnet.
In this case, it is being done my a group of people representing a certain bitcoin wallet company. They get free publicity by creating this, as well as the bonus that if another competitor wallet doesn't use dynamic miner fee payments, that the other wallets will look bad when your spends don't confirm in time.
This group is hiding under another agenda, but above is really whats up.

Most of those doctors, still have their licenses and I feel they should not.

~~Most doctors got away with running pill mills. The DEA did not start cracking down until after a nationwide media frenzy in the late 2000's
Go check out you GTFY link and see the dates for those busts....Pill mills were flying high for nearly a decade previously to that. Of course the adoption of PDMP solved some of this problem.
I said MOST doctors that ran pill mills are running free. This is true. They bailed before the crackdown. Congress and state departments were forced to finally deal with the problem. 
I asked a simple general question. My point is that doctors are a protected Job class, kinda like police officers. It is hard to bring one to justice and even if you do bring a Doctor to justice, the board of some state my likely reinstate their license later. Pill mills were just one example, I can give you tons more.
My questions were general and simple and you chose to frame them in another manor to suit your purposes.
