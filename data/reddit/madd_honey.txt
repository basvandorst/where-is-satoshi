Weeks is a long time in crypto. 
No one is saying don't do it, can't argue against huge profits, just that you should probably be careful. The sentiment is if Bitcoin makes a big move up or down, alts will dive either way. This alt hustle only works when Bitcoin goes sideways, it seems.
Example: have a friend who dropped 3k on tron, then saw that grow to 15k = 1 btc at the time. Except he din't trade it back and is now left with a bunch of expensive tron.

Is it supposed to take 6 confirmations until the testnet bitcoins arrive in the wallet? The transaction is at 4/6 confirmations right now, but it still doesn't show up in the wallet.
Also, searching by hash yields no results.

nope, long wicks on top of the candles signal rejection above, making it more likely for the price to go down. long wicks on the bottom signal rejection below, price will likely go up. how likely exactly? that depends on other factors
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:02:18
long wicks on the upside or downside signal price rejection. a few long wicks in a row - even more so. Nothing is guaranteed, of course, but TA is about using a confluence of signals - different types of signals, this being one of them.

the only way to have a wick down is if the price was there, but then buyers pushed it back up before the candle close. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:05:41
candle bodies show open &amp; close price. wicks show highest &amp; lowest price during that timeframe. 
if sellers would push the price lower at the end of the candle, then the candle closes without a wick down, it ends with the body.

How do we know this huge rise is generated by the sudden interest from Korea and Japan? I'm genuinely curious, from what I've seen in recent days, the price goes down duing daylight time in Japan (meaning lots of sales) and then goes up again during daylight time in Europe and USA.
Could this be an accurate indicator that eastern markets are selling and western markets are buying? Or is there something I'm missing?

some advice: ask yourself how much of that are you willing to loose or see going to half the value without feeling the pressure to sell (you are betting on the future of an incredible innovation, sure, but it’s still a bet, more so on the short term). If you’re still unsure, try to DCA - buy some and reevaluate the price action as you learn more, then maybe buy again.

cheaper and faster and higher storage are all true IF you can always afford to upgrade (maybe you can, but think of really poor countries) . Even so, if we just keep increasing the blocksize, at some point regular users will not be able to run a full node. the goal is to keep the network as light as possible for anyone, anywhere. scaling can take place on layer 2 without putting pressure on the main net. Segwit and lightning are here and work great, I would think the great scaling debate is maybe finally coming to an end.

Oh and while we’re talking about banks in the EU: mine just froze my account as directed by the national tax agency, who often does this when it thinks people owe them money. 
Now they are actually right sometimes and its confusing because of the ill-written work laws we have, but here’s the funny part: my account ia frozen and I CAN’T use money from the account to pay the amount they ask for - I have to get it from somewhere else.
I have no choice but to pay them even if they’re right or not, as contesting the freezing of the account can take more than a month and until then, I’m locked out. 
What I can do is pay them and then challenge the amount they asked for, then provide proof I have paid everything I owe. In case it turns out I was right, I don’t get the money back right away. In fact, this can take years so the most efficient way is to just use that money fot future taxes I would have paid.
This is in the shitty side of the EU, but still. I can only imagine what type of government and bank abuse some other parts of the globe have to deal with.

1. 
I keep reading these days about free SEPA transfers in the EU, but I live in the EU and my SEPA transfers always come with fees (10-20 euros). Maybe banks in some countries offer them for free and I’m just getting screwed? 
Another thing is they are not instant, they take about a day or two. 
Transfers to the same bank are indeed free and instant most of the times, but I do pay administration fees for my bank account so not really free, plus this is just one type of transfer, things change if you send to another bank - fees again, waiting 1-2 days.

No, coinbase is an exchange. They can keep your forked coins indefinetly or even try to pass them on to you as the real Bitcoin, some believe they might try this after the S2X split. 
You only really control your Bitcoin when you hold your private keys.

Yes, your coins will be safe with bread, just don’t make transactions during or immediately after the S2X fork and wait for clear instructions. 
The fees seem a bit high to me, but their latest update includes an economy mode for fees (small fees, but slower transactions) and they’re working on implementing segwit addresses, which will bring lower fees.

I’m pretty new at this and definately no pro, but I think they mean “walls” on the bid and ask graphs - orders for lots of coins (hundreds, thousands) all around the same price, creating a visual wall on the graph. 
If they are above the current price (so on the bid graph), they show a price that if reached, will trigger all those orders to execute and make the price fall. 
If they are below the current price (so on the ask graph), they show a price that if reached, will trigger them to execute and make the price go up. 
As limit orders can be changed at any time during trading, theese walls can gain or lose strenght in the moment, depending on the short-term market behaviour. 
Hope this helps, sorry I can’t provide a screenshot example right now

Sounds good! As long as you have your coins show up in this wallet by the time of the Bitcoin Gold fork on October 25th, you will be able to later use your seed phrase to safely access your gold coins on a dedicated wallet (as soon as a safe, open-source one is made available). 
The Segwit2X fork on November 17 is a different story and splitting your coins then will be a bit more difficult. No real danger in just hanging on to them and waiting though. This article explains a lot:

@_date: 2017-10-18 12:21:45
Some SPV wallets will get confused about which chain they’re on immediately after the fork. 
Each will handle the situation in their own way, so its best to check their announcements. 
Samourai, for example, stated they will follow the BTC chain and will make B2X withdrawals available asap. 
Bread lets you choose a node to follow, so with proper info after the fork, after the dust settles, you’ll be ok.
Bottom line is, make sure you control your private keys before the forks and wait for clear info about how to safely split, once the dust settles (definately don’t make transactions during and immediately after the S2X fork). 
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:31:30
Not sure, afaik they haven’t added support for bcash yet, so they might take their time with these forks also. 
I understand they allow you to access your private keys, so if you know them, you’ll eventually be able to acces the forked coins using another wallet, when all is clear and more info is made available. 
But it’s still a web wallet, so less safe than a mobile / desktop wallet, which is less safe than a hardware wallet, which is less safe than a paper wallet. Check out these great videos by Andreas Antonopoulos:

600 M people are not going to onboard overnight. 2,4 years sounds like a very reasonable time for that level of adoption, I’d be actually happy with that.

I use bread on ios atm, currently waiting for a ledger nano s. my next choice would be electrum, I guess.

Thanks for this! 
I've been trying to DCA and Buy The Dip like crazy for the past 3 months, even made a few profitable trades, just to get the hang of it. Would still be better off by about 0.3 BTC if I would have just went all in on day 1. 
Can't complain though, it was fun and I've learned a lot. Now I just hope I can convince myself to check the price once a month instead of once every 3 fucking minutes.

Just because they invest in bitcoin doesn’t mean they can now control bitcoin.

Same, I was willing to pay/donate just for the beautiful design and UX, even set up Bread for at least 3 friends as their first Bitcoin wallet, but was conpletely turned off by them when they wouldn’t give a fuck about segwit despite calling it “a priority”. Instead they worked on 4 things: redesign (like the 3rd one in a few months); launch of shitty brd ico; supporting bcash, subtely  supporting s2x. 
Just look elswhere for a wallet. Greenaddress, Samourai, the cool guys who actually believe in Bitcoin.

Yeah, except micro would be something like 0.5$. What LN enables we should be calling nanopayments. Which just opens up the way for the next big evolutionary step - streaming money. Andreas Antonopoulos has some amazing things to say about how streaming money will change things. Found it fascinating to imagine the possibilities

I personally take this comment as a good indicator that I should buy more corn

Yes, one blockchain can service everything, with layers on top / sidechains.
There is only one truly secure and decentralized network, and that is Bitcoin. Nothing else comes close (market cap, transaction volume, trading volume, number of nodes, number of miners, hashrate, decentralization, active development - quality and quantity)..
