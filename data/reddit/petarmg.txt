And if you encrypt your wallet with password? Where is the gap?

The program will not run, but it will show you only an error. Everything other will be fine.

I'm finding the hardware more easy to lost/stolen. I'm prefer to use Bitcoin Core + encryption and backup.

Thanks for suggesting, I will add this in next release.

You have to buy only from trusted sources. coinbase, localbitcoin etc. but they have high fees. On other hand you can buy from people directly, but the chances to be scammed is very big and there is no way to return your money.

Just install a bitcoin core, encrypt your wallet, and make wallet backup stored somewhere offline. It's that simple.

It's normal speculative market. It's nice when you have such a margins of the price. Don't worry, especially if you buy your btc when the price was lower
