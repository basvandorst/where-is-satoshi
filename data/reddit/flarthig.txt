I wonder what the exchange rate is on sleepcoin?

What changed his mind?

I think back to those days when I was telling people about it and showing them how it works. I even gave it away for free.
Their response was that I’m stupid and they laughed at me.
Then they giggled even more when it hung out at $200 - $250 range after that huge first spike.
They even argued with me that I was wrong about bitcoin because “it could be stolen” as though that was ever an argument I put forth.
The crappiest part was that I let them make me doubt myself and I bought significantly less than I should have. Hell, had I bought litecoin in the days where bitcoin was in the $800 range, I would be very happy with myself (maybe... anything can still happen).
The moral of the story is that when people put forth crappy arguments to defend their ignorance because of their fear of the unknown, don’t trust the way they’re thinking. It’s not that they’re bad people, they just are trapped (as most of us are) in the parochialism that comes with wanting to be on the side with the most people on it, even if that side is doing and saying really dumb things.
I’m still learning this tough lesson.

I have felt regret for purchases I’ve made with bitcoin before.  It’s a stupid thing to regret.  The thing to regret is not buying bitcoin back as soon as you’ve spent it.
This requires that one keeps on the ball. The rewards for doing so are great.

I was Dan in 2013. While my excitement for bitcoin and blockchain technology has waxed and waned, other’s hatred of me seems to have only grown.
I’ve learned that what was peddled as friendship was oversold and that the RSI on my personal development indicated a lot of room for growth.

The lesson here is that if you trade with feels, you die.
