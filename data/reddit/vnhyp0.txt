There is a "coin control" wallet based on Bitcoin-Qt code that someone created that does allow you the ability to choose outputs to spend.
edit: I think using: Run listunspent, choose the outputs you want as inputs, do createrawtransaction, signrawtransaction, sendrawtransaction. Make sure you don't mistype a hash though!

I lost my password to a multibit wallet several months ago, does this mean I can break into it somehow?

I do not like the payout system. This is the primary reason I have never mined at your pool. Decent pool otherwise, and I do like the stratum proxy you put together a long time ago!
Here is the relevant link for payout system:

The password is 60-70 characters in length, uses uppercase and lowercase, and special characters. I stored it encrypted with axcrypt also. Is this an issue? Thanks for the information!

Hi Victoria, 
Is it possible to send tips in YouTube live-streams? I attempted this, and contacted support and got no response, a few weeks ago and was unable to send a tip. 
Thanks for the great service! kebab @_date: 2014-11-09 05:08:56
Isn't the cost to perform a finney attack much greater? Perhaps requiring confirmations for transactions over a certain value will address your problems.

This has been around for a few months (perhaps more?) for PayPal Select users, and refers to the location on their website to link payment methods (banks and credit/debit/gift cards) and access saved offers.

I have had an auction in the mining contract section listed for ~20 days now, and I had seen the category prior to listing my auction. I listed it in "Computers/Tablets &amp; Networking&gt; Computer Components &amp; Parts&gt; Other" and eBay sent me "MC999 Listing policy violation alert: Miscategorized Items" saying the listing should be in the category "Specialty Services &gt; Web &amp; Computer Services &gt; Other"
Instead of posting in the Specialty Services, I decided to put it in the Mining Contract section since it seemed more apt.

At least you found out how your computer was compromised. TeamViewer running on your PC with pw used many places and 50BTC in a wallet, with another pw used many places, and with your wallet file in an your email, accessible from an already opened browser.
Not that hard to see after reading several of your comments.

Even more exciting; I was just estimating the loss based on the single pic and was most likely under-estimating total hash-rate. Impressive density, but poor implementation.

Thanks for the response. 
I didn't remember the password and used copy/paste from a text document that I encrypted with an easy to remember password. I just randomly hit the keyboard while pressing shift a few times to get the long password (could be more or less than the length I specified, but was a guess). It is a trick I have been using to store passwords for some time, but I didn't properly save the file for this password. 
That makes sense than, I was thinking there was a vulnerability in the software itself perhaps that might allow an easier time at breaking the encryption. I highly doubt the password can be cracked using traditional methods with any technology known, but if there is a software flaw (or NSA previously weakened encryption and it became known, like elliptical curve crypto). 
Thanks again, have a great day!

If they were supposed to ship you miners after 12 months hosting, the purchase was not for simply "virtual goods." Also, you can claim a PayPal dispute for up to 180 days after the transaction.

Those were probably mined using their hardware/cloud mining.

YouTube Live-Streams don't seem to notice my tips. Thanks for the great service! @_date: 2014-11-22 01:00:18

The option to have all tips, sent and received, to automatically have the private option enabled would be great. This could reduce spam, mainly from received tips, since the tipper can append private for the desired result. cookie

Sending tips through email and private messages would be a nice feature, although this can lead to scams and spam with fake tips I imagine. Perhaps allowing a user to create a tip for a designated user (maybe with custom URL, or selecting an account of theirs linked to CT) for a specific amount to send to the recipient would work in some regard. Thanks for the great service! @_date: 2015-04-02 20:58:38
He confirms it [here]( stating, "Through GAW, I offered the use of the coin-swap system. I did this because it helped them launch their service more quickly, as they will be eventually building their own."
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:46:59
I believe Josh (or perhaps GAW) bought Coin-Swap exchange a few months ago, and Mineral is using that code.

The pool is being attacked via DDOS by DD4BC (according to Derrik moderator in cex.io chat), asking for a 5 BTC ransom to halt the attack.
