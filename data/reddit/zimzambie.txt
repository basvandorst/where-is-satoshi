This is a stupid that makes no sense 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:46:43
You aren’t half as smart as you think you are stfu and don’t be condescending online it makes you look stupid
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:03:17
Same difference
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:33:09
Yes they literally have the same difference. Think about it
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:40:22
Dude you’re fucking stupid
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:43:35
Woah so you’re telling me companies fake scarcity to raise their demand???? Wtf not possible you’re breaking my mind. The basics of supply and demand go straight over my head because I’m a fucking retard
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:53:48
Bitcoin transactions get processed with miners or gpus. People get paid to mine so they buy GPUs to profit off it. They’re always sold out so GPU companies raise prices to match the demand
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:49:51
Why would it be chaos? Wouldn’t it get rid of the issues of fees if you didn’t have to pay some outside group to process it? And I only really know the basics of how mining works, I’ve been doing it for a couple years now but am kind of iffy on how individual transactions go through
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:08:17
I do get it, I just think the idea of having giant blocks that have to be found by giant pools as centralizing and was wondering if there’s any way it can be changed to individuals building blocks with their personal miners and putting those blocks into the chain
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:04:24
And the fees come from what miners are paid out to find the block? Is it an even split between people in the block? (When I say even I mean based off of how much they’re trying to move). There’s just no way possible for me to log my transaction myself into the chain?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:09:17
I’m wondering why can’t people have their own miners to process their transactions and group those into a block to put into the chain

Garbage don’t watch
@_date: 2019-03-13 11:13:28
That’s a good point I didn’t think about, property value is a factor
@_date: 2019-03-13 08:25:09
You don’t save 75% you just paid upfront for the next 3 years. It’s the same way tax returns aren’t free money

[crypto is for idiots, I invest the real way](   Your turn

He’s using relatable memes to keep people holding cause they attach their sense of superiority to understanding crap like this and thus makes them think in holding makes them superior

Trading in a way they don’t want
@_date: 2019-02-23 12:52:56
Great more useless tech for people to throw their money at!
@_date: 2019-02-23 12:54:12
Because they don’t profit off that
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:37:36
The hype bubble burst, everyone knew it would happen the only people who are complaining are the people who didn’t time it right
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:44:51
Please for the love of god sell how. It’s back up a bit it’s goin back below 10k soon
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:15:18
Don’t be sorry, you subconsciously called the peak. That’s kind of good in a way

How would btc end corruption
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:45:56
You’re using my comment against me I get it, but what stops people from using crypto in a corrupt way. There’s already been dozens of corrupt things happening like fake ICOs and pump and dumps Btc and btc Cash every few months crypto has some issue and the main celebrity that supports you is mcafee and he’s bat shit insane. For years I saw people quote him and say if he supports it it’s going to the moon. Crypto is a joke and it’s going no where. I’ve been in it for years eventually you’ll figure it out too
@_date: 2019-01-20 08:41:06
Speculation is nice but I’d rather use what works. That stuff is a pipe dream
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:46:20
There’s nothing wrong with the way paper money and banks work it’s just corrupt people, why switch to bitcoin a much more dangerous way of transferring money
@_date: 2019-01-21 04:59:26
Kid I’ve been doing this for years I don’t need to educate myself about anything related to crypto I know all the hype terms and ways to pump it
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:50:03
That’s what I said, any response? And I get what you’re doing it’s just bad
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:21:43
Exactly, third party systems
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:33:55
Turning my cash into bitcoin has nothing to do with transferring? Cause that was my last comment before that one
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:49:31
What are the fees on crypto, robinhood has free trading
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:48:44
That one cryptocurrency is supposed to “destabilize the entire market and replace fiat”. If it’s supposed to do a lot I’m going to expect a lot 
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:17:08
Guess you haven’t looked at the charts in two years. And I’ve made more money on crypto than the average person, it’s still a retarded thing to bet on
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:24:40
You have a dumb dumb brain? Sunken ship fallacy?
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:54:08
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:24:02
How do I turn my cash into bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-20 08:41:36
Why would we do that though, crypto is worse in every way to the system we have now 
@_date: 2019-01-20 06:47:33
Woah modern technology is incredible!
