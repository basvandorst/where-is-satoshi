I signed up, enabled 2FA, deposited ETH, bought an alt, and transferred the alt to a wallet today - all with no fuss whatsoever.
They will probably close to new registrations soon. Oyster demand is killing them, they're pretty new and the site is damn slow - BUT - it seems a well built, solid enough exchange for me personally...

Yeah, you need to work out a proper scaling solution. Amazon S3 for static content and some elastic IPs would be an expensive but easy way to start. Regardless, cannot connect as of now... And could not the other day either.

Your site resolves in my current DNS to 184.168.221.15
That may or may not help you.
Yeah, I'm sure cloudfare will help some.
Good luck with it (sincerely).

I find the word creepy under-enunciated.

It looks to me like the dip has just ended ...

"A Reddit reader asked about my energy consumption. There's not much physical exertion, so assuming a resting metabolic rate of 1500kcal/day, manual hashing works out to almost 10 megajoules/hash. A typical energy consumption for mining hardware is 1000 megahashes/joule. So I'm less energy efficient by a factor of 10^16, or 10 quadrillion. The next question is the energy cost. A cheap source of food energy is donuts at $0.23 for 200 kcalories. Electricity here is $0.15/kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper by a factor of 6.7 - closer than I expected. Thus my energy cost per hash is about 67 quadrillion times that of mining hardware. It's clear I'm not going to make my fortune off manual mining, and I haven't even included the cost of all the paper and pencils I'll need."
That made me laugh out loud. This author is superb. He links to his original reddit post from 3 years ago: 
And thus I'll tag OP, : People are re-reading your article and it's great :-)

You deserve more credit for this response.

This vid is like 6 years old, am I missing something?

I demand you quit reddit for this egregious mistake. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:09:33
You've got to live the rest of your life knowing what you've done, you sick bastard... 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:33:21
You seem remarkably calm about maybe but maybe not having 10 million dollars......
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:44
Who could say.
I care not.

Well done.

I'd love to be able to pay off half of my mortgage. It would completely change the lives of me and my wife to do so. This amount is equivalent to 10BTC at today's value.  I am 10% of the way there.
I will re-assess my goals on Jan1 2019, and decide whether to cash out my FIAT (because I will be waiting out the likely Jan Dip) or to hold it for 6 weeks and reinvest thereafter
