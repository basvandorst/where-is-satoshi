Remember when btc was supposed to be a currency instead of an investment? This community is while bitcoin will fail in the long run.

Does anyone actually give a shit about the principles of bitcoin anymore or is everyone just a speculator hoping the price skyrockets?
This coin will fail with the current mindset of this community.

That comment seems a bit silly to me. I've never posted in this subreddit before, and have been a fan of doge since I found it early January.
- You could care less if people don't want to buy it or trust it yet. They will eventually.
How do you know they will eventually? If nobody actively encourages them to accept it as a currency, then why would it change? You can sit there and assume that people will eventually take notice of you and come to you instead, but that's not likely. Right now you have the less known product and if you want it to gain attraction, that will require active marketing.
- "That type of aggressive recruitment has the signs of a cult or a Ponzi scheme"
Not really. Is coca-cola a cult or a ponzy scheme for spending millions upon millions of dollars on advertising? Belief in your community and your currency does not indicate a scam of any sort.
- "The developers changed it from a fixed amount to a non fixed supply"
I'm no economist, but the way it was explained to me that's a good thing. With a steady supply of new coins, Dogecoin becomes less of an investment currency and more of a market currency, allowing for its widespread and longterm use as a competitor to contemporary fiat money. Bitcoin is more like a stock than an actual currency, the way I see it.

They have nothing. Read the other comments. This guy is a phony.

Is it that they don't accept Bitcoin or that there's fees and Bitcoin was made to fight against unfair fees and taxes?

Make a brand new gmail account and contact them asking if they still have your info and you're willing to send them the BTC if they do and to send you an address. You will see how clueless they are.

Potential to increase their customer base. Prepare for the future. Why do you think Microsoft accepts bitcoin?
