A former employer accused him of pirating passwords and domain names. Instead of defending himself, he chose to move to Japan and had a default judgement filed against him by the French court when he failed to show up. Nevertheless, it was never really considered to be a criminal offence, but rather he was found to be “un délinquant,” or in English, a delinquent offender. 
It sounds like childish and irresponsible behaviour on his part, yet that's not the same as financial fraud.
Nothing in Mark's record shows him capable of defrauding $450 million. 
Undue focus on either Karpeles, or in this case Giancarlo and crew risks missing the bigger picture of what goes on behind the scenes. Having a fall guy like Mark is necessary in order to create plausible deniability for those truly responsible for these kinds of crimes.

I read that article, and it all sounded rather penny ante, and there was nothing there that he did anything more than be an annoying person to work with who a few times irritated employers enough so that they wanted to sue him. If you've ever been in business, you'll recognize that occasionally customers may over-react and want to play a legal card. That doesn't make Mark a criminal mastermind who could have planned and executed a $450 million heist of his own exchange.

This is a very similar rationale to what was used in arguing that MtGox depositors should go along with the [Sunlot deal](
This large, unexplained disappearance of coins from Bitfinex, is not too dissimilar to the case of MtGox, and it could be an integral, planned part of a [hostile takeover/asset stripping scheme]( First arrange for the exchange to be short of coins, then offer to rescue it from it's troubles with a buyout.
Just as the owners of Bitfinex are now being blamed, Mark Karpeles was faulted for MtGox. 2.5 years after its fall,  Karpeles has been released from prison. Were he all so guilty, they would have probably thrown the book at him and the key away. He's out though, because they never had enough to hold him. When something like this goes wrong, it's always easiest to blame a scapegoat.

The fraudster would have had to have administrative access to install Willy &amp; Markus bots and access the Mt. Gox DB. That's why it has always seemed compelling that it had to be an inside job.
@_date: 2015-12-24 01:18:34
Agreed, although the circumstances are still quite unclear. Mark could have lost control over his administrative privileges either through compromise or coercion. 
Apparently, there has been some history of intruders gaining access to Mt. Gox's offices and something could have easily been planted such as a key logger to obtain passwords. 
Also, reportedly Mark had some level of involvement in the SR investigation, and at one point was actually even  suspected of having been DPR. He has publicly denied this, and of course Ross was instead prosecuted; however, he did cooperate with the investigation. It would not be completely unheard of for a confidential informant to be asked to turn over his passwords.

They were probably sold off by private placement or else through the activities of [user TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK / THK] ( If so, then someone, somewhere must have ended up with a very large pile of fiat. If they're smart, they would have slowly repurchased the missing bitcoins during 2014-15, probably at much lower prices than they were sold, pay them back to Mt. Gox, and then collect the difference in fiat between when they sold them at the peak in Dec., 2013 and later on after the price tanked and were repurchased. The operators would have made a quite handsome profit by doing this--Illegal and unethical--it goes without saying.

The gist of MK's public statements seems to be to distance himself from the on-going bankruptcy-liquidation proceeding. He has said several times that he's no longer involved, that he can't discuss what happened at Mt. Gox, and even that he has signed a NDA to that effect. So, Karpeles apparently believes someone else is running the stonewall, and not himself. This may be merely a pose on his part, yet what if it's actually true, and he is simply out of the loop at this point in time?

That's bass ackwards. Willy and Markus were instrumental in buying the bitcoins on Mt. Gox without ever paying for them, and then once sold resulting in a 650,000 BTC uncovered short position. The story about stealing them in 2013 is a mere fable that has been refuted by the Tokyo police who admitted 99% of the coins disappeared through *fraud* and not theft.

Essentially, you're saying M.K. bought up large quantities of bitcoins on margin (infinite--his own), and then once he sold them had a massive uncovered short position in bitcoin. If so, it would make sense for him to buy them back after the crash at bargain prices and then collect the difference in price between when he bought. Should this be the case, it is surely fraud, yet perhaps not out-and-out theft so long as his customers finally get their bitcoins back. Incidentally, there are several other possibilities for who could have instigated the scam. MK is far from the only suspect, and since he is still a free man, probably not the best one.

These two users only ever *sold* bitcoins, and conversely Willy and Markus bots only ever *bought* them, so there must be some connection between the two bots and these two users. If the bots were busy buying bitcoins, of course with non-existent funds, and TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK and THK sold them in Hong Kong, the result of selling these "borrowed" coins would be a net short position for Mt. Gox. I suppose another function of these two Tibanne users could have been to sell off coins newly mined  by those Butterflies you mention as well as ones it got from bot purchases on Mt. Gox by Willy/Markus. Who then is sitting on a large cash hoard from selling off what would appear to have been a massive quantity of bitcoins?

The author seems the most concerned, in his own words, that bitcoin "aggravates the over-accumulation of capital and exacerbates the social inequalities that its supporters hope it will combat." He is essentially guessing about the outcome years down the line, and assuming in the future there will be the same uneven distribution of bitcoins as exists in the present. His crystal ball may be in need of a little adjustment though, as that is far from any foregone conclusion.

There is some evidence that MtGox was hacked through a [transaction malleability attack]( although it's very difficult to come up with any kind of scenario for how this method could actually account for the huge number of "disappeared" bitcoins, around 650K, that allegedly went missing. The best indication is that only a few thousand coins could have been hacked this way. That has led many people to discount this explanation as a kind of phony cover story for what really did happen there at MtGox. The famous "MtGox hack" has become something of a media myth that has little apparent basis in reality
[The Tokyo police leaked out]( in January, 2015 that it was a case of insider fraud, and that is still a very real possibility. Apparently though, this fraud could never be prosecuted. 
For example, it may be possible that the bulk of the missing 650K coins belong to the owners of Mt. Gox (Mark Karpeles or other behind the scenes' backers), or possibly even to some other entity which either refuses to press charges or else has simply reclaimed its own property through some means. There has never been any proof whatsoever that any more than the 202K coins which have previously been recovered by the trustee actually ever even belonged to the public (aka the creditors). As it is, the 202K still amounts to roughly an average of around [25 bitcoins per claimant]( in the backruptcy proceeding. Note: There were only ever around 8,000 claimants approved by the trustee, despite wild media claims that hundreds of thousands of depositors lost their money in the collapse.
It should be noted that [Mizho bank has been sued by MtGox users in Chicago federal court]( for allegedly limiting withdrawals from MtGox while simultaneously continuting to accept deposits, thereby inflating customer losses.

If Karpeles truly had almost *no* coins, as you say, then where did the [200,000 bitcoins found in the old format wallet]( come from? Do you really believe the story that Mark forgot he had them? Back then, their value was at least $100 million.
I'm very sorry to hear that you lost your money, but if it never actually reached MtGox, then it must have been diverted somewhere along the line in the the banking system. 
The Swiss investigative firm, [CCI]( has raised its suspicion that between January 25 and February 25, 2014 money that had been "deposited by clients of Mt. Gox was reported as transferred to Mt. Gox's clients' accounts, while in fact was routed elsewhere." A CCI analyst got his money refunded that was sent to Mt. Gox’s Polish bank, and this is documented on their web site.

The Internet *is* a potential single point of failure for the bitcoin network. Should ordinary communications ever become interrupted by, say, an EMP strike, then packet radio could be one of the few ways left to keep bitcoin alive and running. Of course, this presupposes a few people shield their rigs in Faraday cages against the EMP waves and keep on mining. This seems to be at least a remotely possible future scenario, but of course never one to look forward to.

This is the nice thing about blockchain technology. Regardless of how Mt. Gox handled coins in its hot and cold wallets, and database, there is still a record on the blockchain that may be traced. That makes these bitcoins less than completely fungible.
If you parked your car in a parking lot, and had the misfortune of it being there when the company went bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee would take charge of all of the assets of the company, yet your car would still be returned to you. It would never be considered as part of the bankruptcy estate. For the very same reason, neither should the bitcoins held for safekeeping by Mt. Gox be considered as part of its estate. They belong to the depositors and can be traced back to the transactions in which they were initially deposited there.
Also, under the current interpretation of Japanese banking law, bitcoins are not considered to be currency as in the United States. See: [Wikipedia]( So it would appear, only *contract law* should apply, not banking law. Thus, the Mt. Gox "terms of use" *are* relevant as they represent the users' agreement with the company regarding their coins that have been deposited or "parked".
Bitcoins not withstanding, I generally agree with you that Mt. Gox acted in the capacity of a bank, but only in so far as the *currencies* it held: USD, JPY, EUR, etc.

The Tokyo court seems to have ruled that bitcoins are mutually interchangeable or fungible, while in reality they are only partly so.

My view is that depositors should *not* have equal standing, but rather *greater* standing than mere creditors. The bitcoins were never lent to Mt. Gox, but rather under the contractual agreement made with each user, as stated in the web site "terms of use", the actual bitcoins themselves were held on behalf of its depositors. Bitcoins are  not completely fungible and can be traced back to a particular transaction/address. Hence, users have a right to have their own bitcoins returned, or equivalent value.
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:05:17

The Mt. Gox database must record when each account was opened as well as all deposits and withdrawals over time. I'm not talking about the "leaked" database, but rather the real one the trustee has in his possession on the company's servers.
If a bank were robbed back in 2012, then why should later depositors in 2013-14 pay for any funds that had been lost in some past robbery? Those who lost their money in 2012 lost it. Those who deposited funds later on that were never stolen should have them returned.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:24:42
This is a little bit different, because each bitcoin deposited in Mt. Gox had its own separate address, and the transactions can be identified on the blockchain wherein the coins were moved into Mt. Gox. The trustee has these addresses and should be able to identify which cold storage addresses were emptied out during the 2011-2012 timeframe. Of course it has never been proved that any were lost that way, yet there appears to be some evidence of it from the "leaked" database. Any bitcoins emptied out during 2011 to 2012 should be regarded as permanently lost and not counted in those ones that must be refunded from later deposits.
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:20:34
The private keys were being held by Gox for safekeeping--just like a piggy bank holds your coins. Once it gets emptied to buy gum and candy for a thief, it's empty. However, if you fill it back up with coins later, then that is a new batch, and only subject to loss if there is a new theft.

After the Dwolla seizure took place in May, 2013 there was an obvious cash squeeze going on--to state that the company was completely insolvent though is more or less supposition.

There were withdrawal problems at various times throughout the second half of the 2013 before the final collapse at the end of February, 2014.

If most of the coins were lost from cold storage from late 2011 to 2012, then perhaps long term Mt. Gox bagholders should recover a smaller percentage than those who deposited coins later on.

His point was there is no evidence any Mt. Gox theft occurred in an earlier timeframe, say late 2011 to 2012 instead of right before the collapse, and that it continued to take in deposits knowing that it was insolvent. The only source we have for what happened is the leaked database that was probably released by the perpetrators merely to confuse the issue and cover their own tracks. It has large gaps in it, and may have been corrupted.
@_date: 2015-07-31 09:35:06
Can you say a little more about this--do you mean something special in Japanese law? It seems like a point of logic to me, rather than one which is subject to legal interpretation. If the coins are stolen...they're gone. You can't add more coins in later and claim those are the same as the ones already removed, especially if the the theft happened two years earlier.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:38:57
Any idea how many users have actually made claims? I lost count somewhere around 16K, but I'm sure there have been more. That represents an average of around a dozen coins per user. (202K BTC / 16K users ~ ~ 12 BTC/user).
@_date: 2015-08-01 00:20:19
The user/depositors' relationship with Mt. Gox was defined by the company's "Terms of Use". These say absolutely NOTHING about the user making a callable loan to Mt. Gox. Here's what they actually do state:


...6. it will hold all monetary sums and all Bitcoins deposited by each Member in its Account, in that Member's name as registered in their Account details, and on such Member's behalf.


Nothing in these terms excludes or limits the liability of either party for fraud, death or personal injury caused by its negligence, breach of terms implied by operation of law, or any other liability which may not by law be limited or excluded.
Since each transaction can be followed on the blockchain, if you know the addresses, then you know exactly how many bitcoins are being held for each user, and when they were deposited.
You are conflating the idea of a bank which takes deposits of cash/checks etc. and then loans them back out on a fractional reserve basis and that of the bitcoin safekeeping function of an exchange which is governed by the web site's terms of use, not banking law.
That is the difference between the term "creditors". which is what the trustee keeps unfortunately harping upon, versus "depositors" which is exactly what Mt. Gox users were and still are according to its terms of use.

Just for the record, it was 850,000 BTC that mtgox originally claimed were missing. Back in Feb. 2014, when all this first came to light, the exchange value of 1 bitcoin was approximately $530 U.S. That's where the number $450 million first came from. 850K BTC x $530 = $450 mil. Subsequently, 202K BTC were located in a bitcoin wallet that had been overlooked. These are the coins that the bankruptcy trustee has been selling off to fund the rehabilitation of mtgox.
There are many theories about what happened to the missing coins. The leading [one]( that has received the most attention is by mtgox victim and creditor, Kim Nilsson, who works for a cyber security co. His view is that MtGox had been missing coins for years, but kept it quiet. Of course, there are other theories too. There was a [leak]( from the Tokyo police in early 2015 that concluded that the disappearance of the missing bitcoins had most likely been an inside job.
In June, 2017, Jonathan Levin, a representative of the security company, Chainalysis, [testified](  before a subcommittee of the U.S. Congress that his firm had been able to identify the destination of the still missing 650,000 BTC.
So, we are all awaiting further details from the various investigations.

In the [LRB article]( the date mentioned is 1 January, 2020 for returning the Tulip trust bitcoins to Craig Wright.
You might be thinking about another one of Wright's trusts--the "Seychelles trust" also mentioned in the same article. Supposedly, Wright had withdrawn 650,000 BTC from it to fund his "research and development stuff". He also stated that he had lost a "large wallet" when MtGox collapsed. Interesting that the exact same number of bitcoins, 650,000 BTC disappeared from MtGox when it collapsed. The bankruptcy trustee could be planning to distribute the bitcoins that he controls in the September to October timeframe. However, he has only ever claimed to have the 202,000 BTC that Mark Karpeles found in the "old format" wallet. 
The next creditors' meeting will be held on September 28, 2016 in Tokyo, so perhaps we'll learn more then. Also, Kraken and Jesse Powell have promised a post mortem report giving their assessment of how MtGox failed.

According to the [Daily Beast article]( MtGox was missing 80,000 bitcoins when Mark took it over from Jeb McCaleb in early 2011, so it was always short bitcoin while Karpeles was in charge. This deficit apparently was never disclosed to him by McCaleb until after he had taken the company over. Being short bitcoins could *not* be what forced MtGox to close down. It may have been shuttered to protect depositors' funds, rather than steal them, but then protect them from whom? There are certainly enough heavies around who might like to seize them. 
202,000 BTC have been found, are in the trustee's hands, and ready to distribute back to the depositors. 650,000 BTC are still missing. Could they be from Craig Wright's "large wallet" that the the [LRB article]( reports he lost when MtGox closed?

You are assuming Mt. Gox was genuinely insolvent and that there were never enough bitcoins to back up the BTC amounts entered into their accounting database. 
While the recent WizSec report is highly suggestive in making the claim that Mt. Gox had been operating on a fractional reserve since 2012, and clearly their investigator did do lots of work on this, there is too much missing data in the leaked Mt. Gox database that WizSec used, to ever draw any real conclusions about there only being 20% left, or some other small fraction. The DB was most likely doctored as part of a coverup by the leakers/perps to confuse and throw investigators off their trail. They may well have done a most effective job of fooling people. 
Without the addresses being released by the trustee, which so far he has refused to do, investigators can do little more than hypothesize about what happened to the missing bitcoins. With the addresses known, they can be traced on the blockchain, and it will be pretty clear what was really going on at Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:36:54
You might be right, who knows? Apparently, Karpeles has signed some kind of NDA (he said that in one post here). It's rather difficult to defend oneself while legally required to remain silent.

Actually, it's *not* completely true that it would be naive to believe some coins had not been lost. We know now for sure Mt. Gox still had 202K bitcoins when the company collapsed. These are the ones the trustee will now distribute. Even if you hypothesize all the rest were missing, that's not what made the company go bankrupt. Bankruptcy means the company was unable to repay its outstanding debts. 
To make that happen, all you would need to do is make the 202K bitcoins temporarily inaccessible (as in have an insider/stooge hide them), and then manipulate Mt. Gox's cash position by freezing up bank accounts or whatnot to make it go belly up. Who would do something like that? Who usually benefits when there is a forced bankruptcy (besides lawyers, of course)?

It seems like a very dubious assumption that those in charge at Mt. Gox were completely unaware of the operations of Willy and Markus. Sounds like a cover story. Also, why all the NDAs and secrecy? Why not be open about the investigation unless there is something to hide?

It's more related than one might ever imagine. To paraphrase this *BuzzFeedNEWS* article it was a "Dash for bitcoins" when it came to [Mt Gox](


Mt Gox depositors are now being told they can't receive their distribution until after the mythical CoinLab lawsuit gets settled for whatever one bankrupt company supposedly may owe to another belly-up business.
 
Are asset rich businesses ever targeted for asset stripping? What else could the meaning be of "strategic" in *strategic investing* and *strategic property*?

Claims accepted by trustee: 45,609,593,505 JPY
850,000 BTC reported lost at time of bankruptcy: 850,000 * $483 equals $410,550,000. Convert this amount to JPY at 109 JPY / $1 and you have *44,749,950,000 JPY* that were ever "lost." That's roughly a difference of less than 17,000 BTC more now claimed than the total of 850,000 that were originally supposed to have been deposited with Mt. Gox in the first place.That's less than a 2% difference, but it's still over the amount that disappeared.
This seems a little surprising since there was much speculation that many depositors would never file for their bitcoins for fear of exposure; yet, it appears there were more bitcoins claimed than had been lost. If true, then it may raise questions about the accuracy of the vetting process for the accepted claims.
Note: the trustee pegged the value of bitcoin at $483 at the time Mt. Gox went under.
EDIT: I just realized the trustee is now using the conversion rate of $454/ 1 BTC not $483. This part gets a little bit confusing because the JPY/USD exchange rate has been fluctuating a lot since 2014. However, running the math using this number makes the comparison even much more stark. Something doesn't add up.

In theory, if you had the addresses, it should be possible. That's assuming it hasn't already been solved.
@_date: 2016-05-11 19:46:47
Agreed, but what we've really lost is the ability to check the veracity of whatever findings the trustee and Kracken finally have for us. Should all the coins be returned, then there should be very few complaints. That would be ideal. Many expect fewer than 20% will be returned. In that case, there will be many questions raised about what happened to the balance of the coins.

That snowball has been rolling downhill for a couple of years now gaining more and more traction as it goes. I first read about it two years ago on [Tuck's blog]( Sounded crazy at the time, but after learning about [Shawn Bridges and Carl Force]( maybe not so much any more.

I assume you're using the editorial "we" here--meaning those of the bitcoin community at large who are concerned about all this--but from a practical standpoint, how would an independent assessment take shape? It seems like a worthy undertaking to me--even if 100% of coins should be repaid to depositors.

How can you argue this when the results of the investigation by Kraken and the Trustee haven't yet been released? [Jesse Powell promised the public a very thorough investigation]( thorough even than depositors could ever conduct FOR themselves. That was used as justification for never releasing the addresses. Powell claimed his Kraken team had better information available to it than the public would ever be likely to obtain on its own, so it was pointless, and releasing the addresses would invade the privacy of mtgox users. Why not give the man a chance to deliver on his promise before making such a complaint that the risk is "impossible to quantify".
On the very day when Mark Karpeles has been released from prison, isn't it rather ironic to speculate at this late date that the "disappearance" of the coins was caused by some insider? Who do you propose actually was the thief if there ever was one?
[You yourself have argued in another post]( that Willy robot was buying BTC from MtGOX clients to sell in China, perhaps with non-existent dollars. Hopefully then, if it was never Karpeles, then Kraken's post mortem will at least reveal who was behind the Willy and Markus bots.

The factors which would cause me *not* to reject your statement as being little more than *Argumentum ad Ignorantiam* are the length of time, as you rightly note and the whole atmosphere of secrecy around the proceedings. As [Kolin Burges stated more than a year ago](


Perhaps this is typical in a Japanese bankruptcy proceeding, yet it gives me a farcical kind of feeling about this. 
That's why I have welcomed Jesse Powell and the Kraken team as a *breath of fresh air* should they be able to clarify things and help depositors better understand what really happened with MtGox and their coins.

Complete, *not* partial, refund of MtGox depositors' frozen coins would be truly bullish. Until then, foreign investors will remain skeptical.
