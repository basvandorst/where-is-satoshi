I really like Trump and his position isn’t surprising. His job is to make the states and the dollar as strong as possible. I disagree with his view and would hope he lets free markets do what they do.

I have an account with coinbase and blockchain app. How do I add coins to blockchain app? If I buy on coinbase then send to my wallet number to blockchain I'm paying a fee twice...

Hi guys. What is a trusted exchange I can purchase alt coins on? Such as Neo, Binance coin, etc.
I used to have binance but the google authenticate is unlinked because of my new phone, and to relink it requires the app and it's not availible for ios. Then I tried signing a new profile and learned that they are not accepting USA customers and their USA site is not yet complete.

Would someone take a moment to explain why this isn't like the bubble at the end of 2013 when bitcoin was first around? I understand it's much more capitol flowing now but anything else?
