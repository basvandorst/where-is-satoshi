yes, only bitcoin can be digitally transferred without an intermediary. But only cash can be physically transferred without an intermediary. They each have their place.

you could say that. but the money is not coming out of thin air. They can only lend money that depositors give to them. The reason it is considered "creation" is that the money is sort of counted twice. The borrower has the actual money, and the depositor counts his bank account as actual money, even though it is just an IOU.

that doesnt even make sense as a statement, since this activity is the definition of a bank. Any business that does this activity, is – by definition – a bank. So of course nothing besides a bank, can be a bank. 
It is not fraudulent because banks transparently state what they are doing and you can take the risk or leave it. Buyer beware. Don't like it? dont use banks! Also, what is stopping anyone from setting up a fractional reserve bitcoin bank? If bitcoin takes off, I'm sure those will start popping up.

they arent "doublelending." they take a $100 deposit, then they make a $100 loan. there is still only one hundred-dollar bill. the borrower has it, the bank doesnt, and the depositor doesnt. The depositor cant get his money out until the borrower gives the $100 back to the bank. 
No money has been created out of thin air. It's just that the same money gets counted twice, hence, "multiplied". do you understand?

The whole key is that the interest on the debt is not immediately extinguished along with the principal. It is rebated to the government, and not taken out of the economy. Everything can balance out in the end without increasing the debt/money base.

I believe in basic income, which means there can be private property and people can earn as much wealth as they want, and claim as much private land as they want, and exclude poor people from planting crops on their golf courses. But in return for this, the wealthy must provide a minimum level of subsistence for the poor. Because private property requires initiating force against the poor. So it's a grand bargain.

The Federal Reserve provides dollars. The Fed and the banks provide network services for transacting in dollars. Owning a dollar doesnt pay any dividends because owning a dollar doesnt entitle you to any of the profits of the federal reserve or the banks.
By owning a bitcoin, you do not own anything that provides a product or service. You dont get dividends from miners or people running nodes. Bitcoins dont pay interest or dividends just sitting there in your cold storage.
Owning a share of a company entitles you to the profits that result from the employees of the company doing work. Do you see the difference?

"Perpetual debt"


the debt is paid in installments and the banker spends the interest before the final installment is due. Lets say you have a 3-person economy of a central banker, farmer and storeowner. the central banker has $0. The farmer has his field and $0, the storeowner sells farming supplies and has $0. 
1. Farmer needs $100 from banker to plant crops. Banker creates debt money out of thin air to lend to farmer at 10% interest. 
2. Farmer now has $100 and owes banker $110 including interest.
3. Farmer pays $100 to storeowner for supplies.
4. Farmer raises crops and now has crops to sell.
5. Farmer sells crops to storeowner for $100. Farmer now has $100.
6. Farmer pays banker $55 installment. Banker now has 55, farmer has 45.
7. farmer sells crops to banker for $10. Farmer now has $55, owes banker $55. Banker has $45.
8. Farmer pays banker $55 installment. Farmer now has $0, owes banker $0. Banker has $100.
9. Banker extinguishes $100 of debt money. All parties again have $0.
All of the original $100 has been extinguished, and all the debt has been paid with interest.

money supply is the first two columns added together. I though that was obvious. I am well aware of how inflation happens but it has no impact on my simulation. This also has nothing to do with fractional reserve. The simulation works for both fractional reserve and full-reserve systems. If you want to show your own simulation to counter mine, then do so. Otherwise, you havent really made an argument.
edit: and long-term inflation doesnt happen in my simulation because the money supply is the same at the end.

The thing about property is that it doesnt require a contract with every single human, in order to enforce it. Only the buyer and seller need contract. From the point on the buyer is legally justified in using force on other people who never signed a contract with him and never consented to his ownership. Let that sink in.

Im trying to figured out what operation with 15 and 4 equals 9.
Anyways, you need to learn the terms "nominal" and "real" as they apply to interest rates. It will help you communicate what you are trying to say here. go read this, then come back:
Second of all, deflation does not subtract from nominal interest rates to equal the real interest rate. Deflation *ADDS* to the nominal interest rate. 15% nominal rate + 4% deflation = 19% real interest rate. Thats why a high-deflation environment would obliterate credit markets. If a lender calculates that the borrows each have a 4% chance of default, he needs to charge 4% nominal interest just to break even. If deflation is 4%, then the real interest rate on those loans is 8%. So the borrowers must each make the calculation that they will make an expected profit of 8%. So we see that in a high deflation environment, only borrowers who have a reasonable expectation of very high profits would get loans. The appetite for risk would be drastically reduced. So you would probably see a lot fewer new business ventures being launched.

Another possibility is that the precursor to bitcoin was some classified project that he worked on while he was working for the government, and even though the government decided to shelve it, he independently continued on with the work after his employment contract ended. This may have put him in violation of his NDA/security contract with the government, which would explain why he is so hesitant to take credit for it. (Although if that were the case, it would be a pretty bonehead move for him to attach his own name to it.) No matter what turns out to be the truth, it's fascinating shit.

@_date: 2014-04-03 16:51:49
1. No, they cant. Your source and the video are in conflict. Watch this part of the video:  . 




ok this is a bit inaccurate. the commercial banker cannot create cash currency out of thin air or a hat or whatever. What he can do is extend the borrower a line of credit in the form of a bank account balance. The bank simply allows the borrower to write a check which is a promise to pay on behalf of the bank. It's not actual hard money, just bank credit, which some define as money, but is not as good as cash. If the borrower demanded his loan in the form of cash instead of a checking account, then bank would not be able to make the loan in the same way. The bank would have to first borrow cash from another bank and then lend it to the guy.
Also, this is not some crazy unnatural concept as it's presented in the video. If you tell your friend to order pizza and that you'll pay for it on delivery, then you're doing the same thing. You are extending credit to your friend. He represents to the seller that he will be paying for the pizza. When it comes time for the seller to demand cash, you are the one who must produce the cash.


**The video here skips over a very important part of the process. It fails to mention that the first bank must now transfer $10K to the second bank** The original $10K that was created by the first bank was not actual money, just a promise to pay. The second bank doesnt have any money yet simply by receiving a check. They have to take that check to the first bank, and redeem it for real money. Then, since the first bank only has $1111 of actual money, which is tied up as reserves, the first bank has to go and borrow $10K from someone else in order to make good on their check. This could be from other banks, or in case of emergency, the central bank. In either case, this is not free money for the first bank. It has to pay interest on that loan.
Assuming a simple economy of only 2 banks, then the first bank must borrow the 10K from the second bank. At this point, it would cause the second bank to max out its reserve limits. And second bank wont be able to make any more loans. So the original $1111 cannot be multiplied into $100,000. It can only be multiplied into $10,000.

it's called the money multiplier because the same money is counted twice. It's really bank credit that is created, not actual money. If the bank only has you and the borrower as customers, you cant hold the $100 bill in your hand, and the borrower simultaneously holds the $100 bill in his hand. there is only one $100 bill. But it's counted twice, so there is $200 of "money" in the economy. I dont recall you asking me a question about the central bank. I have never denied that central banks do create money out of thin air. That is their job.

you could say the same thing about most private properties, since they mainly derived from governments stealing these lands from others and handing them over to the private sector
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:10:09
well then you dont understand the argument. the deed was created by the state, which means the original private owner had the land transferred to him from the state. This is the contract between the private owner and the state. Hence, the state maintains ultimate ownership of the property. you said:


Similarly, the state gave you the deed with the understanding that you would forfeit the property back to the state when you stopped paying taxes. You continuing to stay without paying taxes breaks that agreement.

the market cant exist without coercion. how else can you enforce private property, except with coercion?
edit for my downvoters: Only if everyone innately behaves as perfect capitalists, can capitalism exist without coercion. Similarly, if everyone behaves as perfect taxpayers, taxation can exist without coercion. And if everyone behaves as perfect socialists, socialism can exist without coercion.
Perfect, coercion-free obedience to any social order is a utopian fantasy that humans will probably never achieve. Not even ant colonies have perfect obedience. Yes! Ant colonies actually have ant police whose job it is to go around and coerce other ants and keep them in line!
TLDR: coercion is unavoidable.

Yeah this is what i dont get. I hear people saying "if the difficulty goes too high, then people turn off their rigs, and then when the difficulty goes down, they turn on their rigs again"
But how do you get to the next difficulty change, if everyone's rigs are off? The difficulty can only change after 2016 blocks. If mining is not profitable for anyone, then everyone should turn their rigs off. If everyone turns their rigs off, then no more blocks are mined, then the difficulty never changes again. 
The only solution I can see is for transaction fees to spike. But would that even work? seems like a tragedy of the commons situation. Maybe could cause a hyperinflationary spiral as people get out of bitcoin when it gets too expensive for all parties.

wrong. this is how it goes: they get a $100 deposit. they keep a fraction of 100 in reserve (5). They lend out the other fraction (95). They do not print money. They increase the money supply by relending it. Basically the same 95 is counted twice. Once as the deposit and once as the loan.

the Federal Reserve banks dont have shares, per se. yes, the banks must invest a percentage of their capital, but this doesnt equate to voting power. It's one vote per member, no matter how large. So it's impossible to acquire controlling interest in the Fed.
Also, the dividends on paid-in capital are dwarfed by the amount of profits paid out to the US Treasury. And majority voting power on the Board of Governers is retained by government appointees. So by those two metrics, the real owner of the Fed is the US Government, and by extenstion, the citizens of the US.

No, that's fiat currency.
Fractional reserve is nothing more than when you deposit money in a bank, the bank then turns around and lends out a fraction of that money to a borrower. 
Again, they are separate concepts and you can have one without the other. You can have fiat currency but outlaw fractional reserve banking. Or you can have gold or bitcoin banks that run on fractional reserve.

Actually, now that I think about it, this is totally pointless. The whole point of cash back is that you want to convert digital dollars into physical dollars in order to make physical transactions. You cant even make physical transactions with bitcoin, so why would you do this? If you want bitcoins, and your debit card issuer is willing to give you "bitcoins back", then why do you need the middle-man at the gas station or the grocery store? Your bank can just transfer the bitcoins to your wallet address over the internet. No need for a third-party POS station with a cash drawer.

Probably because these things can only mine $0.05 per day, while broadband internet tends to cost at least $1 per day. So as it is now these stupid things can't afford jack squat with the pitiful amounts of btc they mine.

wait, mining pools don't already do this? God that seems dumb.

I like the part where the bitcoin chip in your phone uses 10 cents of electricity to mine 5 cents worth of bitcoin, which it then uses to purchase 5 cents of electricity from the coffee table charger, which it then uses to mine 2.5 cents worth of bitcoin, and on and on until your phone dies.

That's what JP Morgan did before the Federal Reserve. 
I think what you need is a bitcoin banker or oligopoly of bankers whose livelihood depends on interest from bitcoin assets. Then it would be in their financial interest to take the huge risks necessary to support the value of bitcoins, otherwise they'd have a shitload of toxic assets on their hands and a busted bank.
Of course these guys would be massively powerful in the bitcoin world, and possibly Jewish. Not sure if you guys are ready for them apples.
