Whatever you may think. I am pro cryptocurrency. 
If you can't spend it, what use does it have as a currency. It's literally in the name cryptocurrency.

Then you will understand they are talking about Q1 and Q2 only.
They posted a net positive profit.
What part about that do you not get?
Don't twist it into something it's not
That is PROFIT. Not revenue.

So it's a shit post because it's on the testnet. Cool.
I'll just post a meme of the Bitcoin price then.
@_date: 2018-09-27 01:53:48
Yes. It was posted on Sept 26.
Do you understand what Q1 and Q2 are?
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:31:27
100% with you. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:22:01
Might. 
Hahaha nice one.
Some solid bets going down there.
They just posted some of the biggest profits in the entire market and some people are trying to shit on that.
Some people are delusional.

I find it hilarious that this only has 30 upvotes and a story about someone using 1 btc to travel the world has 300+
@_date: 2018-09-27 01:56:46
This is the closest I can find. 
It's around 29%

You are incorrect. 
This was dated June 30. 
Like most of us who hold crypto. They have lost some.
June 30 valuation at $735 USD. Today that is still valued at $520 USD each. 
$777 million.
They are still in the black.
Sorry to burst your bubble.
An IPO will help with cashflow and liquidity if any issues exist.
That is a force to be reckoned with.

Good rationalisation.
It could also go to 0.
That bug this week has opened some people's eyes.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:25:44
I'm just going by the data.
Please do post it if you can find it. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:56:22
The biggest net loss with the biggest profits. 
$1.1 billion. 
Let that sink in.
How was everyones portfolios this last six months? 
They still posted that profit.
Keep the negativity aside. A business that boasts a $1.1 billion profit is doing well.

Way to find an outlier and cherry pick. 
The same way I could choose data that is skewed the other way.
Food for thought.
Imagine paying 2.4% in fees at a bank. Wait.. this is what we are trying to avoid..
