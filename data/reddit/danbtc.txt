Love the people that defend it with their life. But they pay me everyday, how can it be a pyramid ponzi scheme?!! :)))) I give them 6 months to collapse and then you'll see people pursuing lawsuits against the anonymous owners when they realize that their principal has vanished, lol.

Faucets pay you to view ads, complete small tasks (captchas, data entry, surveys) or signing up for trials. It's not worth it, payout is so small that you're better off doing normal work, even McDonalds will pay a lot more. They also keep the payout limits high knowing that the majority of people will abandon the site before reaching the threshold, that way they get to keep all their ad revenue to themselves ;-)
If you're willing to complete menial tasks for $1 - $2 an hour you're better off joining Amazon Mechanical Turk or another micro work site, at least that way you don't have to worry about catching 20 viruses in the process and you can be sure that you'll be able to withdraw the earned money.

The majority of tasks are fairly easy, for example tagging images or data entry. The main issue is that most tasks only take a few minutes and don't pay well (careful, some don't pay at all) and you need to constantly check for new tasks so you'll spend some time just trying to get work, particularly in the beginning when you don't yet meet the minimum qualifications for many of the tasks. 
Depending on your qualifications and worker reputation you will have the option of doing better paid work later on such as transcribing videos, content creation or translations which pay OK but generally speaking, especially in the beginning, people only make a few $ an hour. 
Some good resources:

I've tried it many years ago, mainly out of boredom. I cashed out after making $20, it just wasn't worth my time. It's legit but again, you'll make more money with any real-world part-time job. I could see it being attractive for someone who can't leave their house and doesn't have enough skills to get work on Elance.

Why would Newegg care as long as he pays? Do you expect them to ask people to sign a declaration of intended use before selling to them? Would you also have an issue with a small computer shop buying them to build gaming rigs or a company buying the same quantity for internal use?
Whenever there's a high demand people will do this knowing that they can get more than MSRP, happens with new Apple products and gaming consoles too.

Really depends on your monthly income, if it's completely out of the ordinary they may ask where you got that money since they're required to watch out for money laundering. Why would you deposit everything just before the end of the year though? The tax man is already lurking...

I wish my tax rate was 35%... I'm self-employed and pay close to 50% in taxes (yay Germany!). EU is not enterpreneur-friendly, hard to write things off, banks won't touch you and you get taxed to death.

Not wanting to be poor is understandable. The unhealthy mindset is worrying about what you missed out on, hindsight is always 20/20 so don't go through life regretting what you didn't do. There was no certainty that BTC would ever reach those levels, had you invested your money and it tanked you would have been even more upset. Crypto is too risky to be considered an investment, at this stage it's still speculation and literally anything can happen, some people become millionaires overnight and others lose everything. It's a high-risk game and only after the fact do you know which was the right decision.

Probably because the government (if it's still running) and your neighbors can't come take it from you. Precious metals draw too much attention. Not sure how they expect to spend it though...

Don't think it'll make much of a difference if you're converting fiat, no reason for them to prioritize one over the other. 
PS: Careful with YouTube, tons of YouTubers are pushing BitConnect (the Amway of Crypto) so they can earn money through their affiliate program. Never trust anyone who talks about building a team or wants to be your sponsor ;-)

Cheapest (and riskiest) would be buying from someone in person. I'm sure there are plenty of people on Craigslist who need cash right away and are willing to sell below market price.

Poor guy has to make some coin :)) It's like all the "neutral" BitConnect reviews that never fail to have an affiliate link.

Just stay cautious, with crypto being all over the news and people not wanting to miss out MLMs and other scams will have a feeding frenzy. Always remember, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is, no one is just giving away money. Best thing to do is ask yourself how they make their money and 9 out of 10 times that'll give you the answer.

Cool, you may indeed get away with it then if it's considered non-US income. How much income did you generate anyway? If it's less than the exemption you won't have to file either way, I didn't have to for US income until I started OPT, before that it was just a few $K I made on campus so it fell below the threshold.

Mining generally isn't worth it anymore for the average person, if you have a decent rig you can try and join a mining pool but once you factor in the cost of electricity you probably won't make more than a few $ a month. You need a dedicated mining rig and cheap electricity to make more than a few $. Or try mining new altcoins but again, you pay for electricity and if they don't increase in value you'll have lost money.

Kraken seems to well work if you're in Europe. ID verification can be a pain though and the site is unreachable a lot due to high traffic so not the best place right now if you want to trade on short notice.

If it was an upgrade (not clean install) the wallet file might still be there. Check the AppData folder.

Depends on where you live, I had to get Tier 3 verified and it took about 4 days total. Approval of each tier seems to happen in less than 24h, it ended up taking longer because the site is often unreachable and their document upload module seemed to be having issues.

Plenty of financial institutions block it, not just Raiffeisen. Reason for this isn't fascism, it's risk management. A lot of fraud is being committed with crypto-currencies and some banks just don't want to risk getting caught up in theft and money-laundering activities. 
You'd be the first one to cry foul if someone illegitimately purchased crypto using your debit card or online banking... Crypto makes it super easy for thieves and there's little chance of them ever getting caught. Some banks will let the transactions through if you call their customer support and legitimize it. My bank even goes as far as blocking international SEPA transfers by default, you need to go to a branch and ask them to unblock them.
If Raiffeisen won't budge then sure, go ahead and switch banks.

Understanding the risk is key. Last few months have seen a lot of new people buying crypto not wanting to miss out. They bought high and saw their money disappearing over night... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:26:06
Why? Incoming is less risk to them. If someone takes over your debit/credit card or bank account they'll use it to spend money, not receive money. Depending on the circumstances the bank would have to write off the losses and even if they can hold you responsible for the losses there's a risk you're going to default which isn't in their interest either.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:34:54
That's life, easier to make money when you have money. Just be glad you didn't lose it all, unless you have time to hold it's just as risky as gambling.

Using VPN is risky in the UAE, if they feel you're using it for unlawful things (can be something benign like streaming movies) you risk jail and hefty fines. The Internet there is heavily monitored and censored... Besides, VPN doesn't solve the problem of needing ID and a bank account or credit card.

14 days seems kinda long but not unheard of if they have a huge backlog. Coinbase for example just announced this AM that they'll take up to 10 days for smaller European SEPA withdrawals due to high volume of transactions.

Depends on how long you have been in the US. If you're considered a resident alien then you'll pay taxes on your worldwide income. Immigration status doesn't matter to the IRS, it's purely about how much time you've been in the US.
You'll need an SSN to file your taxes, if you don't have one and aren't  eligible for one you can apply for an ITIN (individual taxpayer identification number) which serves the same purpose.

Yeah, payment needs to clear first, otherwise people would be able to overdraw if a bank transfer gets cancelled.

Yeah, it says so above the continue button. BTC network fees are very high right now, quite a few threads on here about people paying more in fees than they are sending.

Google "substantial presence test" Unless you just arrived a few months ago you are considered a resident alien for tax purposes.

Depends on the extent of the war, if it's regional and not all out you may still be able to use Internet nodes going through neutral territory; for example, if Australia or Europe managed to stay out of it you'd still reach Asia by routing through those continents, bandwidth would be severly reduced though. 
Biggest issue I see is EMPs, the public power grid and most if not all network infrastructure would fail and would take decades to rebuild, within that time new currencies (be it digital or paper) would almost certainly arise so even if you managed to shield your wallet the coins would have most likely lost all value by then. 
That's assuming a few decades are enough to rebuild, if the death toll is high enough you may end up with complete anarchy eventually resulting in a lot of new city states rather than the united countries with a central government we see today. Any area with a lot of natural ressources would be fiercly defended by the local survivors making it hard to unite people again.

No one in their right mind will accept PayPal, too easy to file a dispute which the seller almost always loses. Buy local if you need it right away or ask a friend or relative to open a Coinbase account.

Been getting them for months like many others here, nothing to worry about, they're just bluffing. If they had anything they would send proof ;) Today I got a new one saying a hit has been ordered on me but he does not really want to do it and will spare my life if I send $1500 in BTC, lol.
