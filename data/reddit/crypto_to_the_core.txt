WRONG.  We are talking about an AUSTRALIAN business here - so everything I have said is exactly how it works in AUSTRALIA.  All credit cards issued in Australia have pin numbers (for at least several years now).
And a settlement can be done at any time - as many as you like or once a day at the click of a button, and then the money is yours (in your account).

I've graphed and analysed the data for the same period (my data actually goes back a few months earlier), and the trends and my predictions based on these are nowhere near yours.

1 confirmation is basic.  Wait for 3 confirmations to be sure.


WRONG.  Credit / EFTPOS transactions using wireless merchant terminal are virtually instantaneous (a few seconds), and have very low fees  (0.85% merchant fees for credit card, much less for savings / cheque accounts).


WRONG.  If people are using the card in person, and key in their pin - which is how the vast majority of payments are done for this kind of service - then there is no way on earth that they can decline the transaction or get it reversed.  The banks say - only you know your pin, someone may steal your card, but if they have your pin then you gave it to them = your fault.  And rightly so.  Keep your pin secure.

No it didn't - that's complete non-sense.
In 2017, BTC started rising quickly 2 weeks prior to CNY and continued well beyond CNY.
In 2015, BTC was flat until CNY, and then rose quickly.
In 2014, BTC declined throughout Dec, Jan, and Feb.
In 2013, BTC declined throughout Jan, and Feb and continued declining after CNY.

All in takes is another Mt GOX, or another Bitconnect scam ....  and sooner or later the tide could easily turn against cryptocurrency - not because of the underlying technology (which is awesome and powerful), but because of all of the con artists, scam artists, pump and dumpers, and thieves.  Tether is a big concern, but there are many other issues.  Anyway, there's a tipping point / threshold, and when this is reached banks will make it very difficult to convert crypto from / to fiat.

Imho, if anything ruins crypto, it will be the scams and really dirty financial practices.  Examples from past and present: Mt Gox crash, scams like Bitconnect and OneCoin, the 1500+ redundant altcoins and with more coming every month (many are scams), insanely high market caps, insanely high prices, Tether (USDT) printing money like there is no tomorrow, etc.  Then when you factor in money laundering, tax evasion, thefts, etc, then the shit really is heading for the fan.
If enough people lose money and complain, then confidence in crypto will erode, prices will fall, causing more people to lose confidence, and prices to fall further, and so on.  If enough bad stuff happens, then banks / governments will be forced to crack down hard on crypto.  
Even a global bank / government crack down might not be enough to kill crypto, it thrived fine in the early years without any government or bank involvement, so there will probably always be a crypto underground.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:37:59

Trying to launder or helping others to launder fiat or BTC obtained for illegal activities or sale of illegal items is a crime. Operating a "money services business" without a license is a crime. I AM NOT SAYING THAT ALL OF THESE APPLY IN THIS CASE - I am illustrating a few of the ways that selling BTC on the street could be illegal.

In other words, all of your "I love Bitcoin" talk is pure greed on your part.  You are pro Bitcoin so that you can make a killing when you sell.
