I believe the comparison was toward attitude, not technology. Their inefficiency in finance may be purposeful, as they have no fear of something akin to a HFT debacle.

You are like the Neil deGrasse Tyson of Bitcoin. People want to hear your explanation of how the technology works, how it's evolving, and to address their concerns and misconceptions. You will be a footnote in the early history of Bitcoin at the very least, and future generations will want to know about that guy. It's only a matter of time.

No, I mean a debacle that could kill their entire market. You can't milk a dead cow.
You're either not familiar with the [Flash Crash of 2010]( or are extremely delusional. That event would have easily sent the United States back to [Black Tuesday]( and beyond had NASDAQ not been shut down and rolled back. If you're a US American, you wouldn't be sitting where you are right now and the United States would likely be entrenched or recovering from a massive drafted war effort.

Extremely delusional, then.

I keep seeing conflict of interest to miners being the case against change, but they have always had to switch to the newest hashing technology to compete. What makes this different from the CPU&lt;GPU&lt;FPGA&lt;ASIC progression? Is the conflict something other than hardware replacement cost?

I don't blame them. They've already been down five days, and they have nothing additional to lose by extending their downtime in the name of proactivity. It's certainly better than reopening the site just to close it down again to address more issues. They have one last shot to get this right and they are trying to put their best foot forward.

To be honest, at this point it makes more sense to buy bitcoins on the market. This may change if their price goes higher, but probably not by a whole lot. The difficulty adjustments will keep the difference pretty close.
If you have a 5770 that sits idle, it may be worth throwing on a slow pool (mtred.com or btcmine.com) and hope for quick blocks. It's hard to say how much you'll make explicitly, but you'll be able to come up with a ball park figure if you use a faster pool (mining.bitcoin.cz or btcguild.com) as a benchmark for a day. All pools average about the same payout over the course of a month.
You should be able to fold simultaneously just fine.
I would not recommend building a new mining rig.

The problem with Bitbills is that you cannot be sure if someone else has the key. Even though they are 'protected', nothing keeps the manufacturer from saving these. There's no real way to know that the bitcoins are still available to the card without keeping a constant eye on Block Explorer.
The method I have provided will allow you to hold 'all of the keys', so to speak. Every piece of the chain is verifiable by you, and no one can stand between you and your bitcoins.
Edit: The beauty and genius of bitcoins is that you are afforded the ability to 'trust no one'. It may require a little more work, but it really is best to take full advantage of.

A 'fast' pool will be more consistent at solving blocks, hence giving a consistent payout. A 'slow' pool depends on 'luck' to solve blocks in a shorter-than-average amount of time. A slower pool will give you more BTC per share since your representation of shares in the round are a higher percentage compared to a faster pool, but there is risk (time spent with no payout) involved with the amount of time it can take to solve a block. If you sit on a slower pool, it's possible that you can come out ahead if the pool is able solve blocks ahead of schedule.
Fast pools can really screw you if your miner is slow. For example, you will make next to nothing if you sit on deepbit.net (over 5 THash/s) with proportional payout. A slower pool will ensure that you get a good average of shares in before a solution is found.
Again, they all average out about the same over time, but I've come to appreciate playing my luck with the slower pools.

Volatility is certainly a huge issue. I think another real issue is that the feds could make a move against bitcoin at any time. Silence does not equate to acceptance. Not that there's much they could do about it; it would appear to some as a Sword of Damocles.

They were being overly optimistic, and I agree; they should be more open about the current state of their operation. I don't have an account there, so my view is that of an uninterested third party.
MtGox was the premier bitcoin exchange, which is *the* position to be in during this 21st century gold rush. I'm sure they are going to do everything in their power to bolster their security and credibility to get that back. TradeHill has since taken that spot, so they do have real competition.

Hey, why not? If your site claims it has been taken down by ICE, nobody can reasonably expect any kind of response from you. It's not like ICE is going to claim or deny it, and you're not going to find anyone willing to go after ICE for it. If moonco.in thought ahead and took the proper precautions, it's pretty damn air tight... even if they made an obvious mistake by botching up the forwarding.

Yes, I'm what they call 'old money'. Got my lifetime r/lounge membership and everything.
I wouldn't say gold was introduced to circumvent anything, other than the lack of funding received from Condé Nast. I'm really surprised they authorized that, but it sounded like the reddit team may have threatened to walk if they weren't allowed some means of funding.

This. I have three 5830 that clock in just under 1 GHash/s and after doing the math, I come out ahead by about $10/month over buying them at market price. Certainly not worth it if you factor in using the proceeds to pay for a mining rig.

Nice try, Bitcoin7.

Don't forget that Reddit has corporate overlords. They are owned by Condé Nast, and such a measure would likely have to be approved higher up. Stigma surrounding bitcoin (black-market, drug trade, money laundering) will likely prevent CN from allowing this. It would only take one huge news event for this to blow up in their face, and I'm sure they know that.

1) Move all bitcoins to a single wallet.
2) Encrypt the wallet with a well-established open-source tool.
3) Encode the encrypted wallet with [optar](
4) Print off the optar'd wallet and laminate the resulting page.
5) Scan the laminated page and verify against the original with SHA-256.
6) Store the laminated page in your bank security deposit box.
7) Delete all traces of the original wallet.
