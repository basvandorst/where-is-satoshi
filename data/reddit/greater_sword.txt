try going to wallet &gt;&gt; seed in electrum, it should show you yours. There is no issue transferring funds from legacy to segwit.

I've never used LBC, but I have heard that once you come up with a deal the coins are kept in escrow by LBC until both parties fulfill their end of the bargain, then the coins are released to the purchaser

no problem. If you aren't spending your coins in the near future it might be best to wait on transferring them with the fees as high as they are (unless that is a non-issue to you). There is no "discount" sending TO segwit, only FROM. Cheers!

No, coins sitting still don't cost anything. Moving the coins to a personal wallet from coinbase incurs a fee

Sometimes coinbase can take a while to transfer your coins since they keep a majority in cold storage. If you haven't seen a transaction in another hour I'd be concerned and contact them

It's funny one guy says "I'd pay for
You but I don't know how from Europe"... and bitcoin would be the easy answer
