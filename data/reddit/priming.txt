In case you want to try out the current Darkwallet Alpha version, here is the link to the Chrome store: 
Just read the description on the side before you start using it.
To reply to the question:
AFAIK the backend stability is the main problem. The Darkwallet is a beautiful product, it only seems that the devs wanted to build too much at once. But give it a try. All is open source (of course), so a community take over would be recommended. If somebody thinks of doing this, please get in touch.

"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is a catchphrase and aphorism sometimes evoked, with variations in wording, when discussing economic inequality. Its most common use is as a synopsis of a socialist criticism of the free market system (capitalism), implying the perceived inevitability of what Karl Marx called the Law of Increasing Poverty.[1]
Wealth concentration is a process by which newly created wealth, under some conditions, can become concentrated in the possession of wealthy individuals or entities. Those who hold wealth have the means to invest in newly created sources and structures of wealth, or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, and are thus the beneficiaries of even greater wealth.

A jump from 1 to 20 is indeed not nice. 
I propose to let the block size increase a few bytes every block and to fit this into the curve of the growth of the speed of the Internet. This way we will also avoid having a discussion again about this when 20 MB are not anymore enough.
@_date: 2015-05-24 02:53:40
beware, bubble
your downvotes made me curious. but the more I read, the less this makes sense.
calculating sha256 hashes aka mining is not profitable in most areas of the world, whenever you actually pay for electricity. building extra hardware for it when you don't use it 24/7 (because mobile) makes it even less profitable. mining will further centralize to areas where power is cheap. nothing makes less sense than having a miner in your mobile or tesla. it was always and will always be a race.
another example: 'Decentralized device authentication. Many applications of bitcoin are not strictly monetary. Embedded mining means that any device can authenticate itself to the network by sending one Satoshi to a specified address.' - the author, balaji, clearly does not understand how asymmetric cryptography works. authentication is not a function of mining or having satoshis. but we will see web-of-trusts emerging.
while i agree that in the future a lot of devices will have wallets (crypto key pairs), i could not disagree more with that miners (hashers) should be embedded into all electronic devices. 
stay away. focus on important things. hope this goes away soon. there are better futures we should work for.

Interesting. I recorded a video to show you how it works. Of course you should embed your personal address (from this wallet extension or any other valid bitcoin address) and not the address of the URL.

people should stop being against decentralized blockchain based platforms only because they have another alternative currency and then start using instead centralized services which have units in SQLdatabases called bitcoin. you see that bitcoin does not scale at the moment! interesting example is for example  . it is a decentralized reddit type of thing. if crypto becomes popular - bitcoin will become super-popular!

No, there is no point in Factom right now. There is no blockchain bloat right now on Bitcoin because of people who insert hashes. Factom inserts already about 2/3 of all OP_RETURN transactions right now (even before it's launch), so it is the cause of bockchain bloat... and you get dependent on a centralized system (factom) if you use it. Better just store the hashes of your files yourself or use Proof-of-Existance DOCPROOF if you can't do a transaction yourself because of lacking technical skills.

Thanks, your feedback is helpful but not applicable.
"decentralise all the things" is not an admirable goal, especially seeing as how technology is not at a state where every type of system can be decentralised
appcoins are unsustainable and unnecessary


the minute you introduce any Reddit-style voting you either centralise that or you have to have on-chain voting


further to that, paid-for votes are trivially gamed, corporations will be able to push their own links to the top whilst unsponsored links (the ones you actually want to discover on a Reddit-style interface) will flounder at the bottom
PoS is unnecessary for this


given the intended use, PoS just opens up attack vectors you don't want to have to worry about a Bitcoin-style blockchain is a terribly expensive storage mechanism, which makes it unsustainable


@_date: 2015-04-03 18:09:22
All things you mentioned you do better without Factom if you want to be safe. 
Factom is poluting the blockchain already! It is not even launched and makes already 4 out of 6 OP_RETURN (data) transactions on the bitcoin mainnet in my 1h sample.

Good idea. I sent him a tip using the WeTipCoins Wallet
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:01:22
Yes. It is a tipping jar. Not a bank vault. The tip goes to the owner of the website. Whoever owns it. At least you would notice that somebody had access to your website (in case you got owned and you try to claim your tip). It's just save enough for tips, same as the hat in front of the guitarist on the street is just save enough, too.
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:37:31
The transactions are already confirmed. Look up the txid on blockchain.info. You can use  to convert the asm (hex) to readable text and you will see FACTOM... who else would do that?
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:34:50
There is a second post exactly about this topic linked in this part:
We try to survive through tips, too. Wikipedia model.
"Security through Decentralization
In order to secure the tip jars, a decentralized trust will be created. We call it the DeTrust. It is decentralized because no single entity can access the tip jars on its own. Every time a tip gets claimed, the different entities of the DeTrust need to fetch a copy of the website and look for a valid bitcoin address inside the HTML. If they find a address, they collaborate on creating a transaction from the temporary address to the address of the owner of the website. If multiple address are found, the first one gets taken as the lucky one and receives all the coins.
Technically the WeTipCoins Wallet creates the hierarchical-deterministic P2SH addresses offline and does not require any server-calls."

It his website which I tipped through the WeTipCoins Wallet 
You can read here how it works: 
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:33:12
This is almost like WeTipCoins.com works. All posts are provably on-blockchain.
To submit a post/link/url you tip the owner of the url any amount larger than the dust limit. Further you can collect Karma/Reputation when you post frequently things which other people tip/like afterwards. After a certain threshold you become a moderator and can remove spam.
Creating an account on WeTipCoins.com is currently free, but we plan integrating a blockchain-based naming system which is essentially what you are asking for. Instead of proof-of-burn the fee would go to the miners. 
If you want to try out the system for free with some new play coins and not real bitcoins, check out

The more I know the less I know, you know?

Do you have some example code or API calls for this?
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:58:35
You are mixing up things. I was never talking about that the recommender algorithm/math is on-chain. Only the URLs and tags (and coins/votes, relations-ships between entities, time, general balances...). That's enough to let algorithms compete on who delivers the best recommendations. But sorry, have not more time to go deeper into this. You will see.
And of course. If 30% of all coins of a PoS-coin belong to one entity, it is probably not decentralized, especially if most of the other coins are offline. Nobody would doubt that... But this is not a valid attack because the change was made from inside. The same, a blockchain rewind could also happen in Bitcoin. The core-devs have the power to set checkpoints if they wanted...

Easiest is to use  if you want to learn how to create a Bitcoin transaction...
If you want to use CoinAwesome there is a coinawesomejs-lib inside the FoundationAwesome Github ( and use following line of code when you build a transaction:                         
transactionbuilder.addOutput(coinawesome.Script.fromASM("OP_RETURN " + hexData), 0)
If you just want embed an string into the CoinAwesome blockchain you can also use the browser wallet extension for Chrome and add a tag (your string).
