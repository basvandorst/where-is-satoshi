Bitfinex article was old news. They reposted news only to manipulate market. (6 dec)
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:41:21
not new was posted already
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:51:41
what are you talking about it was not even 10,000€ on bitstamp one hour ago
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:05:45
yaya cointelegraph have no idea what they're talking about as usual, check cryptovest from last week this was already covered non-event
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:35:32
"This is nothing new and has been known to the Bitcoin community for a while.”
not really important
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:44


Long time they have moved to anonymous cryptos. Now bitcoin is something Wall Street, Cme and big boys are looking at.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:01
hope for them it won't be as worthless as their money.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:47:05
bitfinex only need 2 confirm for corp accounts the coins have been delivered hours ago
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:51:52

@_date: 2017-11-21 10:48:52

@_date: 2017-11-21 08:43:53
yeah right
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:02:00
yup hacker can't cash out... meanwhile people sells their coins low and other profits.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:44:24
I pointed the other thread you created on r/Ripple to someone of Gatehub.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:03
hacker cant do s** with the coins, stop freaking out and giving your btc to whales..
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:08:11
let's wait for the press release.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:20:57
of course bitcoin is not illegal, it's the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:00:13
"voluntarily" sure... 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:10:16
@_date: 2017-09-30 12:36:58
I like how these articles are most of the time based on pure speculation.


But which legislation? Nothing says they want to allow exchanges again.
But even those two are to close at the end of october (and "this" is official, they already stopped deposit and new customers afaik).
Btw I don't find the same infos in the chinese articles as reported by the english one.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:52:36
of course they won't ban the coin(s), fiat exchange is another story maybe.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:44:33
a reuters article? lol

They want money to flow back in their economy and national currency, bitcoin is getting too important, other countries will try to stop it too I'm sure, and also I'm pretty certain it's not temporary.

@_date: 2017-09-14 15:01:22
Sure they would close a perfectly good business voluntarily.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:28:07
why it would be temporary
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:28:07
why it would be temporary
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:38:59
they still have to close

@_date: 2017-09-15 06:37:53
it's only money and I lost a lot believe me.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:01:09
well they plan to make their own national cryptocurrency who knows..
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:38:59

depend if they ban fiat

@_date: 2017-09-30 12:53:20
The only thing China is looking at is the yuan and their local economy, ppl will once again be surprised at the end of october to see the exchanges close, not that it matters a lot now anyway.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:40:06
yes I'm not sure why ppl keep reposting this, Tone Vays explain it on Twitter: "Maybe 5% of  ecosystem understood, the rest thought  were investing in $BTC"
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:18:08
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:51:36
is it your address lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:50:54
I would be very careful about what they announce, they specifically said they don't want to encourage speculation (rather the opposite) and want fund to go in the real economy.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:07:34
their own national cryptocurrency
