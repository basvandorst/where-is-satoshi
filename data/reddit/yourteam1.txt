   The point is that it shouldn't be private. And not about money control. "Federal" is just a word here and part of the company name, without any belonging to the gov. 
   Why no one doesn't care about this? But everybody care that bitcoin(or other crypto) mining take a place on private basis!

And all this "if" based on predictions of future rates of virtual currencies! What are u a cannibals??? LoL
