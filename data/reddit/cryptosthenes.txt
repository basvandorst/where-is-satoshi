When you sign in on their website it is doing so through your bank's own API, so Coinbase never actually has access to your bank account. You jus at one point sign in to your bank account and tell it to allow Coinbase to do certain things, rather than Coinbase signing into your bank account every time you make a transaction. Any change you make in your bank account security information would not be reflected in Coinbase's stored data about your ban account.
"Your online banking username and password will be requested - these are used for a one-time verification step. Additional security questions (as well as a PIN) may be requested depending on your bank's security procedures. Your username, password, and all other information entered in this process are not stored in our database, and once your bank account has been verified the logs of your activity are deleted. Verification is simple, secure and fast!"

I love this technology and what it could do for the world.

Thanks, seems to be what I was imagining. Hope to see it grow more. I was hoping to see a service where someone who suspects corruption etc. could post their reasoning and so-far inconclusive evidence for their suspicion in order to start a pool to compensate someone who may risk their job to provide the missing pieces.

All the more reason to just switch to bitcoin and not have to rely on a third party guaranteeing your financial safety.

Hate to be that guy, but if that image is your own could you capitalize the 'e' in "extremely wealthy people" just to make your very true message about bitcoin just a tad bit more effective. If it's not yours then just ignore my criticism.
