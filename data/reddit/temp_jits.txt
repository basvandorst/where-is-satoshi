Coffee is a drug.  Darknet not fiction.    
Let people rant.  Not much else to do

Bitcoin? Well, not so much.
And you are really under estimating the darknet markets and the darknet in general

Why the rush.  Wait for coinbase.    
  
Fees will make your $10 into 8 very fast...

Woah- thanks friend!  Now I have two bitcoin "wallets"!

Lose or loose?
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:01:50
i bought bitcoin to spend bitcoin; cryptocurrency is much more than an investment.
