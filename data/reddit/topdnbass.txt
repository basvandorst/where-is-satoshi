Wouldn't a poser be the one following trends of what people say?  
Rather than just saying whatever they feel like? Besides I used cali cause it's quick when typing on a phone.

Let me settle this since some people are interpreting it wrong.  
It's referring to being awake as in an awakening. A realization about the world that usually only comes through the social deconditioning of psychedelic drugs, years of solitude and introspection, lots of meditation, or a high level zen/buddhist type of awakening.   
Part of it is, realizing how everything is run by greed and we're all supposed to fit as a cog in that machine called society.

Yes it appears it's being used almost sarcastically, but still in reference to that type of awakening. I know Rogan is big on psychedelics and heavily influenced by thinkers like Terence McKenna and Alan Watts.   
Terence was big on memes even before they were memes. You see a meme is the smallest packet of an idea. Terence believed one of the ways to a better future was through the spreading of these memes to bring awareness.    
Of course most of the silly memes on the internet don't qualify, but this "imsowoke" thing as stupid as it sounds got people asking questions. I see it as Rogan using his influence to carry out that vision.

Im from cali and I say that sometimes :(.   
Though i never really picked it up from someone. We just would add as fuck to the end of stuff, and I was part of the 90s generation that said lame. The two go together so well!

What? You are the one who called me out. How delusional are you?   
Everything isn't about winning and losing. People like you give CALI and the human race a bad name.   
Now I'll go be with friends who are all from cali, and we'll laugh while our existence contradicts your misguided notions.

There's a lot more to California than your scene in LA. Sure most people say SoCal or NorCal or California, but it's not some universal law.  
Just stop with the poser crap. You are the one obsessing over what people say and how they say it. Learn how to say what YOU want, and have an original thought instead of following every latest trend.   Until then I'd rather not speak to a brick wall of pent up angst and hate.

You seem like an angry individual. Thats quite the generalization. One that turns out to be false.

Ive been using bitcoin more and more because of new places accepting. I kinda assumed that the reverse was true.

His plan must be to install his antivirus on the poll computers. They will become riddled with viruses and trojans. Then his cyber hacker party will do the rest in exchange for Xanax.

Anyone who falls for that link probably deserves to get phished. Unless they are dyslexic.
