You are confused with what I am saying oh wise one. This has nothing to do with mining difficulty.  
In 4 halvening from now the reward will be under 1 Bitcoin per block.  
Unless Bitcoin is worth a substantial amount of money the cost to mine is greater than the reward.  
Transaction fees will outpace block rewards in some odd 20 years, not 140. This creates a situation in the fee market where miners are looking for only the highest fees to cover costs, or not mine at all. You cannot guarantee a +1million dollar Bitcoin that makes a 1/sat fee even profitable.

Bitcoin's value is derived from many, many factors, such as the price itself as it speaks for it's intrinsic value. The proof of work required to create Bitcoins and blocks. The hashrate used to secure the network. The scarcity. The decentralization, the Censorship resistance. The community. And overall the utility that it brings.   
Bitcoin is backed by the blockchain ledger which is proof that you are guaranteed all of these things when you buy and use Bitcoin.

The Idea didn't just "get decided one day"   
It came about as Satoshi Nakamoto solved the "[double spend problem]( which existed for many, many decades. Before that lots of work was done with digital currencies and cryptography to get to the point where we are at. It has been an evolution of cryptography dating as far back as the 36th century BC.  
Not to mention the majority of money has existed on centralized bank ledgers in digital form before their was a Bitcoin(SWIFT/Dollars 2001) For all intents and purposes a highly centralized digital shitcoin. We just take those centralized nodes and distribute them with our own currency that isn't manipulated.

Trading is gambling... It is 50/50. Some people hit big, some lose.   
Sometimes you get lucky and you make the right play. But remember, you can not tell the future, So don't expect to know what will happen for sure.  
I could see a situation in FA where a president tweets poorly of Bitcoin, you call the short, and your bet paid off... But it could have easily of went up, or nothing happens at all. Depends on what the real sentiment was as the news spread. You gamble on a news story.   
In TA you see a formation on a chart and you call based on that information, But you are calling with the 90% of other TA traders making the same assumption and making the same call as you based on formations. This doesn't mean anything other than everyone read the chart the way you did. But perhaps it might pay off.  
That aside, it is still gambling, you are only going to hit some of the time. More often then not you will be wrong. Unless you are extremely rich you will not even be playing the real game, You will be making bets based off of the actual players(whales) who compete for control(who often have insider information) Which is why I would never trade stocks because the companies are the whales themselves. And hey I get gambling, I'm a big poker player. I love slots and blackjack so I totally get it... But I do my gambling at the casinos.

What gives Bitcoin Value?  
Not even it's scarcity. **Decentralization** and **Censorship Resistance** is what gives Bitcoin value. It is what makes it unique from any other currency/system/network. Scarcity has more to do with it's deflationary properties. Things that are not scarce can still hold value. Bitcoin has 4X as many individual units as all the money in the worlds smallest units combined. Not as scarce as you may think, but yes it is still a non-renewable resource. Once it is gone or lost it is gone forever.
What gives Bitcoin intrinsic value?  
Determining through fundamental analysis. Utility is just a gauge. Intrinsic value is inferred from the applications that can be utilized from Bitcoin that are useful such as **money, banking, and payment processing. Timestamping, voting, contracts, census, governing/governance/law, logistics, document and record filing, supply chain, Identification, data sharing/backup, titling and deeding, compliance, advertising, IOT, copyright, software applications, loyalty rewards and gift cards, inheritance, charity, publishing**, and so much more!

 This is a doomsday scenario waiting to happen. If difficulty trends towards zero over time(we know this because of halvenings) you are losing security and decentralization. The network would centralize into a bank and it would become ever increasingly easier to do a 51% re-org. The thing would just implode on itself. The only way to offset this is for transaction fees to artificially go up(not by competing for block space but to satisfy the miners efforts) which would make it almost impossible to move money around, imploding the system. The entire Bitcoin model is incentive driven, not good faith driven. Of course this could all be solved by one easy solution but that is dependent on whether Bitcoin can push a 1million$ or 10million$ or more price tag in the future to justify the fees.

@_date: 2019-07-14 14:57:28
It's supply and demand.  
If there is not enough Bitcoin for the existing demand then the price does go up.  
Bitcoin is a deflationary currency so by definition it's value will rise.   
Decreasing the supply will add additional scarcity which leaves less to go around which should (in theory) "make Bitcoin go up."

It doesn't matter when the last coin is mined what matters is that transaction fees will outpace block rewards and it will happen within the next 20 years.

Utility is not an intrinsic property. Intrinsic value can be measured(not necessarily determined) by the underlying value separate from its market value, or price, and based on qualitative factors (management, development, quality, usefulness, and past record.) through fundamental analysis. Intrinsic property is also different than intrinsic value just so we don't get confused.  
OP says value is derived from Utility, But current centralized systems already accomplish this utility.  
OP says value is derived from scarcity, which I am saying is just a quality, or intrinsic property of Bitcoin.  
What I believe gives Bitcoin value is **Decentralization** and **censorship resistance.**

This is completely wrong. Satoshi made it so that payment channels have been a part of Bitcoin since day one. We are finally starting to see that pay off. It is an alternative to block scaling which has serious downsides. Bitcoin requires a lot of work and a lot of research. every single efficiency upgrade is crucial for the future of Bitcoin. There is a lot of work that is still far from being done. In a perfect world it will work like cash but you can either whine and complain about it like the bcash team or step up and actually start innovating or contributing to this space. Bitcoin can't even fill it's own blocks right now so what would be the point in even increasing blocks??? No we need to streamline the network. The reason other crypto is fast is because no one uses them, not to mention they must sacrifice security for speed. In other words they are centralized pieces of shit. The technology just isn't here yet.

 I'm not saying close it because you need to cash out the money. The entire security model of lightning network depends on you being able to close channels. What happens in the 2 or so halvenings from now when transactions fees can't keep up with block rewards? It would be like a $10 fee just to close out and secure a $10 channel. This isn't just a problem for lightning, it is a problem for Bitcoin in general, when it no longer remains profitable for miners to mine blocks. People brush this off and say "oooh don't worry about block issues we wont have to worry for another 140 years from now" Because of the halvenings blocks are going to stop being profitable to mine, even if you do the math with a 10million dollar Bitcoin it will cost more to mine than you are rewarded. Transaction fees can't solve the issue. Their needs to be a solution.

Bcash doesn't solve any real issues with cryptocurrency. Increasing block size is not technologically interesting or advanced. Thousands of alts have done it. Hell, Bcash wasn't even the first to think of it. Litecoin did it in a sense, then there was XT, Classic, unlimited, What makes Bcash brand unique at all?   
Instead of innovating and actually adding something to the space all Bcashers do is whine and whine. Point the finger. Their entire business model is to attack Bitcoin. What have Bcash devs done for this industry? They don't come up with any real solution to help the technology or solve any of the real problems. Just cybersquat on [Bitcoin.com]( and r/btc, Trick newcomers. Just bunch of Satoshites who paste stupid quotes from a guy who hasn't been involved in Bitcoin for almost a decade. Guess what? Satoshi made payment channels a thing in Bitcoin from day 1 so lightning network was always going to exist. Guess what? Bitcoin will increase Blocksize when it needs it, What is the need to increase it if it can't even fill its own blocks? Guess what we could spam Bcash too but why? Why even care?  
Bcash have given up decentralization in favor of Big Blocks and have even done away with consensus. For god sakes you guys just had a re-org a few months ago are you not at all worried about the security of the blockchain? Decentralization can help with that. Just wait until ethereum crushes you.  
What about capital gains tax? What about KYC/AML? Bcash does nothing to solve friction from government entities that makes it possible to use it in the way you are advocating.   
The only reason Bcash has cheap fees is because of their lousy fee market and hardly any incentive for block space on the network. Low fees and fast transaction times have nothing to do with larger blocks and everything to do with no one is even using it.

**HOLY FUCK.** Why is no one getting this????  
Does anyone even understand what the scenario is?  
The scenario is: **Transaction fees outpacing mining rewards**.  
When this happens there are 2 outcomes:  
**High fees** ORRRRR **Low Security!**  


**You** gave the **Low security** outcome to the **Scenario.** It doesn't matter what their revenue is or how it is now profitable to them... You have now c**entralized mining** into datacenters/banks/"service providers" where only corporations or organizations who benefit from payment processing can afford the mining process(or whatever incentive there might be that a normal miner would not have.) **So you have gone the centralized route instead of the extremely high fee route.** Pick your poison. I have heard devs talk about this, I've heard Andreas talk about this... I'm not fucking making it up you people are driving me crazy.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:23:52
Perhaps. That would be a best case scenario in this situation. Worst case scenario is what has happened before. And we won't know until we do.
We shouldn't give up on main chain or 2nd layer solutions. Solutions are great. There is always an argument to be said that better technology will come along in the future and hard to say which direction it will go in. 
One problem with increasing blocksize is that there is no soft forking it in. It must be a hard fork. People like options with Bitcoin and hardforks don't give us that. When you start saying you are going to hardfork something that has very clear downsides and clear upsides not everyone is going to agree with you. It is doubtful it will be unanimous. You are also forgetting about the factions who want to see Bitcoin fail and refuse to use things like segwit(60% of users, imagine if segwit was a hardfork we would be losing right now.) They will surely oppose logic. Hard forks are not good man! They are more of a solution in the event of a 51% attack than used as a forced upgrade. But not saying it can't be done!!!

Bcash is no more censorship resistant, or less traceable than Bitcoin.   
In fact Bitcoin being more decentralized makes it more Censorship resistant.

 The way I read it is kinda confusing me too but Intrinsic value is more commonly discussed as part of fundamental analysis in determining the value of something. You would never hear the question of "What is something's intrinsic value?" if It was just inferring perspective. It would just be another way of saying "What is the price of something?" as if there was no reason that caused it to be the way it is.

Actually this is a problem that must be dealt with a lot sooner. More like 4 halvenings from now when transaction fees outpace block rewards. Even a 10 million dollar Bitcoin doesn't solve this. The real question is **"What happens when it is not profitable to mine?"**
Transaction fees will not cover the costs for block creation, Satoshi was a smart guy but you can't keep referencing things he said about Bitcoin 10 years ago, It was a different Bitcoin 10 years ago. Obviously there were many details he couldn't foresee. So far I have have seen no good answer posted. However, I don't have an answer either. This is actually one thing that concerns me greatly about Bitcoin.
You guys can downvote me all you want but what I said here was factual.  
It's going right over everyone's heads...
**Either we have higher fees or less security.** you have to pick one. And it gets worse as block rewards decrease with scheduled halvenings. You can't have both with the current model. Unless you come up with a solution you are just pulling stuff out of your ass or misunderstanding the context.
Everyone keeps referencing **mining profitability and difficulty**(which has nothing to do with fees because the users decide fees) and I'm talking about **Block Profitability OVERALL.** Which if the price of Bitcoin is not high enough and the Bitcoin created doesn't amount to enough compensation then the transaction fees don't cover the cost to mine.
There are two things that can happen now once this occurs:  
Miners refuse to mine smaller tx fees making fees much higher than they already are by factors of 100X **OR** you get centralized mining by the few who find it profitable which is more likely since no one is willing to pay such high fees just to cover the miners expenses. This essentially turns Bitcoin into a giant data center or Bank and leaves us open to re-orgs and censorship. Bitcoin is Incentive driven, not good faith driven. People aren't going to mine at a loss to make them feel warm and fuzzy inside.
I'm done explaining it to you "experts"... Good luck on your Bitcoin journeys.

Because with PoW nodes can verify unlimited amounts of transactions, with very little hardware.  
PoS you must buy your right to verify transactions, on top of more expensive hardware for the data.  
As with mining, with little stake in PoS you are at a severe disadvantage over larger stake holders as their odds of verifying transactions dramatically increases over you making you practically irrelevant.
PoW miners have little say in verifying transactions. They are just slaves to the nodes.

Logical criticism will not get you blocked. Honest debate is celebrated here. Retard block size discussion is over, how many times must it be refuted? We WILL NOT sacrifice decentralization for speed and fees, PERIOD. Get over it. See, consensus is a beautiful thing. Keep being an antagonistic dumbass? Take your shitcoins and be gone!  
Real problems that Bitcoin and crypto face:  
\-On-chain efficiency upgrades/ Bandwidth reduction.  
\-Transaction fees outpacing block rewards in 4 halvenings.  
\-Government friction in the form of capital gains, KYC/AML keeping it from being used as cash. Increasing censorship resistance and privacy.  
\-Payment channel innovation, liquidity challenges.   
\-Further decentralization.   
These are the problems Bitcoin Devs are dealing with while 1000's of shitcoins just tinkering with blocksize. Not a real solution, not technologically advanced or interesting. Been done 1000's of times.

You still really aren't addressing what I'm talking about specifically. You just keep saying noob over and over again And talking about miner difficulty like a robot like it was from something you read off of the Bitcoin FAQ.    
Of course I know difficulty adjusts. The market will take care of mining profitability. The problem is that the difficulty required for profitable mining will be low enough for cheap &gt;50% network attack. Bitcoin will either be always vulnerable to attack by competition or expensive. You pick. That will be at the choice of those who make transactions. You act as though there is already a solution for this but there isn't.  [Andreas couldn't even answer this question when asked recently]( Everone's answer is always "oh we will figure it out in a hundred or so odd years from now when it becomes an issue" "Bitcoin will figure out!" And I'm trying to say it isn't 140 years from now It is more like 15 years from now when transaction fees are going to be the primary incentive for generating block rewards. Get it now wise man?

I'm not speaking directly of capital gains but taxes in general that are Bitcoin related. The actual issue is to increase privacy to the point where taxes are not applicable and reduce state exposure. Some countries have absolutely proposed Bitcoin taxes if not already enacted them, the point is that they could. VAT taxes, sales taxes, income taxes, and as far as a deflationary currency whose value is guaranteed to increase, capital gains tax becomes an extremely relevant tax among it's users. What I'm asking is does privacy even solve this or will it still ultimately depend on legislation to ease tax burdens associated with Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the most censorship resistant and decentralized system out of all the cryptocurrencies. Not just because it has the most users. The program itself is the most advanced you can get with current understanding of the technology while remaining a completely decentralized system. None of the other Altcoins can say this. They are all centralized pieces of shit who sacrifice decentralization for speed, or security for processing, or consensus, or whatever. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that even matters because it is the only one that even works and behaves the way it is intended. That security and decentralization is very important to keep governments from being able to manipulate or even kill it. As long as we stay strong together there isn't really much that can be done to stop it.

You need to stop.  
Do not use "Bitclub" or any get rich quick scheme. Do not use cloudmining. Do not buy altcoins. Do not "trade" stock or treat Bitcoin like a stock. You are being scammed or will get scammed. There is only one way to make money in this world and that is to work hard and invest. The work hard part is the most crucial and if you can't do that then don't expect to make any money. I am somewhat aware of your situation in VE so I know how times are tough and things can be out of your control, but you won't stand a fighting chance in your situation if you don't at least work for it. Arm yourself with knowledge . Your question on how to have more Bitcoin has only one obvious answer. Work for it and save it. Provide a good or service, cut grass, deliver goods, cook, clean. Learn new skills, basic ones like carpentry, sewing, cooking, and mechanical knowledge are always good to have. Bitcoin is money, you must earn it.

Me either and that isn't what I'm saying. I'm saying it is very possible that increasing the block size may not ever be necessary, especially if you look at the timeline of up to several decades that they are calling for it to happen. If another solution comes along before then I highly doubt it will be relevant. Saying contrary is also skewing towards a low IQ in the same sense. We need to keep open minds here. Forking and increasing blocksize is risky business. Even talking about it is going to piss people off.  


  
It has been attempted before when transactions were taking up to 6 days to clear and TX fees were as much as 50 bucks for some people. The outcome of that hardfork was pretty devastating and obviously with such crummy on chain efficiency if big block consensus didn't happen then, might not ever happen and we just repeat Bcash drama. Convincing 51% of people with anything is no easy task.

Never said they were the same. I said you need either one to file UDPR


You are suggesting a new trademark can be used to challenge an existing domain name. This is obviously false. To use UDPR to challenge bitcoin.com you need to prove a right to Bitcoin as a brand - trademark, registered business name, company name - **which existed before** bitcoin.com was registered 
That is the entire reason for UDPR. To challange a pre-existing site that acts in bad faith over a brand. Not the other way around, or obviously it wouldn't be a thing. Use your brain little bturd.  


I highly doubt a website that promotes gambling and faucets is not acting in bad faith. On top of that, it is being used to scam newbies into buying a shitcoin, which by all reasoned logic is fraud. The [Bitcoincash.com]( website is shittier than either one.

You can get one right now for around $30k. Compare that at 18million Bitcoins for $9.5k each. Black lotus is 10,000 times more scarce than Bitcoin but only about $20k more than a single Bitcoin. The difference? People have valued Bitcoin more than the Black lotus. So even though Black lotus is more scarce, it is not the sole factor in it's price. Demand derived by utility and other factors are far more important than scarcity.

Using Bisq is private. Buying funds and using the Lightning Network is private. Coinjoin/mixers are private. Atomic swap to Tether is private. Changly to monero and back is private. Litecoin is about to add mimblewimble through extention blocks which if successful will be adopted to Bitcoin I'm sure, which is private. When Bitcoin becomes more distributed it gains more privacy since you arn't using exchanges you are just transacting in an economy, which is what Bitcoin lacks, a larger economy. Privacy can be achieved. Buying from coinbase and sending to your wallet just isn't the way to go about doing it.

Transaction fees are likely to be very high in the future on chain.  Even hundreds of dollars high. The solution is decentralized aggregation pools.

Use [Bisq]( It is a decentralized exchange so you don't have to go through a business just to buy Bitcoin. It is a little more complicated then just say opening a cashapp account but that is the problem with exchanges, they are real businesses so they must comply with local regulations and laws or they wouldn't be able to exist at all.
You do have options... You could try selling stuff for Bitcoin, Buying over the counter, posting ads, using decentralized exchanges... Most of us I think have just have given into the KYC/AML landscape at this point. It sucks because it completely ruins your anonymity. Look into coinjoins and mixers but government still knows you bought in. Bitcoin is working on greater privacy all the time and most problems already have solutions that just need to be tested and implemented.
But kyc/aml is in no way a part of Bitcoin. If everyone just used Bitcoin it wouldn't be an issue either.

Why taxation is theft?  
Because it is money taken from you by force and not by your freewill or charity.  
By definition that is theft.
Why money going to government is bad?  
Government is just another word for **monopoly**. The state only serves to takes away businesses that would otherwise be provided by the private sector. Yes, everything you can think of can be ran privately. Schools, Hospitals, Roads, Defense. It always did at one point in time and worked magnificently better than the mess we have today. That is because private businesses are beholden to their clients and customers. It is only those who provide useful goods and services and excellence to their communities that remain to exist. When the state runs a good or service no one is accountable. The government does not get punished by the free market. It kills innovation in the sector and takes away any motivation for the service to succeed or grow. Instead you get incompetent gooberment employees digging holes and filling them back up for no reason. You get out of control lobbying. You get outrageous healthcare bills. You get dumbed down education. You get gas guzzling automobiles. You get leaches on society. You get the ability to vote yourself money.   You get the welfare/warfare state.

Bitcoin is radically different then what it first started as 10 years ago.   
It is not the same Bitcoin. I highly doubt it will just stop improving or innovating at any point in its existence. If another alt comes along with a better answer Bitcoin will adopt it... We have seen this already happen many times by Bitcoin adopting various technologies that were first tested on alts. I believe your assessment is foolish.

Collectibles generally go down in a recession while commodities/gold/silver go up. It will be interesting to see how Bitcoin behaves during a recession really. So far signs of a weak dollar have positioned Bitcoin into higher highs for the year. I am of the opinion Bitcoin is starting to be viewed as gold and will behave like it more and more.
If the Fed is already lowering interest rates it tells you we are entering a recession right now and they are prolonging the inevitable. QE comes next. What might only be less than a year bust cycle that would happen in a free market prolongs to a 10 year bust depression like last time when they inflated the money supply. There was so much fear of hyperinflation. Now it's round 2. I think the risk for hedging in Bitcoin could see you insane payoff in the coming years. We are now entering the perfect storm, a global recession. With Bitcoin being a global currency we could see a shift in the financial world like never before. Perhaps even a worldwide paradigm shift.

Lee commented recently that no one is developing on litecoin and the main DEV has been MIA for months. Looks like it isn't happening anytime soon.   
I actually oppose MimbleWimble on Bitcoin. Main concern is for security reasons. Bitcoin is meant to be self auditable for your own verification. Open ledgers are the only way to prove there has been no inflation bug applied to the system as well. MimbleWimble does not solve any problems with Bitcoin. In fact, it is taking a step backwards because it does not allow for more complex transactions that allow for things like lightning network to exist.  Privacy is not something I want to see on layer 1... that is for layer 2 with things like liquid and lightning.

I think you are right man. You should totally play around with the technology and see what it is all about. Even if you are burning a little bit of money it can be fun and educational. I would make one suggestion however, You really aren't learning anything by just running a program on your computer called honeyminer. You are basically just stealing a few cents from your parents every month. Honeyminer doesn't even mine Bitcoin so it does nothing for anyone. And you are completely burning the life out of your mac. If you really want to step it up and be productive with your education you can download Bitcoin Core from [Bitcoin.org]( and run a full node! This allows you to verify your own Bitcoin transactions! You are also helping the network. Then download lightning node and open channels. Here you might make a few sats in the long run and save your computer.

This is why we need Lightning network adoption IMO.  
If you got paid in lightning funds would be completely private.   
No way to get audited. No paper trail.   
Once "cashed" out of LN and secured on layer 1 Bitcoin you would be completely anonymous and free to store your bitcoin on the insanely secure and auditable base layer while being completely private and then send back to lightning to do more private transactions as needed.   
Adoption comes when we can opt to be paid in LN funds.

This process will happen within the next 20 years. It is when transaction fees outpace block rewards. There are literally 2 outcomes:
1. Increased miner centralization from lack of profitability at higher difficulties.
2. Extremely high fees to compensate a good healthy mining community.
Most of Bitcoin should be able to operate through payment channels so the effect of high fees on chain could be less impactful through decentralized aggregation pools. You actually want the value of blockspace to be scarce and valuable as this in theory increases the security of the network. With the network ever growing and new innovative solutions constantly in development you can be rest assured miners will always have incentive to mine.

Bitcoin is Manipulation proof. You have absolutely no proof of any such claims. You can't call someone buying and selling manipulation. Bitcoin has a very small market cap compared to what it could be so obviously it doesn't take much to swing the price.

Bitcoin is an open public ledger, not necessarily a file or object that is to be sent. Wallets are only used to communicate to the network and help you create and organize addresses. There are no Bitcoins being sent from one wallet to another wallet or phone to phone. Everything happens on the blockchain and Bitcoins are sent Via address that are recorded through transactions on the blockchain. That means you can verify your payments via any block explorer yourself. [ for example. If your transaction did indeed go through you have proof that you could use legally in your favor.
Under the law they have to provide you with what you paid for or issue a refund in a timely manner.


Bitcoin is probably more secure than using your credit card online since credit cards open you up to all sorts of attack vectors for fraud.

I'll just be the first to flat out say dont do it. It isn't secure. While you may argue a small degree of security with blockchain.com. It is no where near as secure as a hardware wallet. The entire point of Bitcoin is to control your own money, and a 3rd party like this is beyond pointless. Companies like these can and do get hacked regularly and exit scam. These entities are not banks and they are not insured like banks. They keep databases of everything that can be breached. There is no fraud department in Bitcoin that will help you.

Bcash users don't understand that the point of Bitcoin is **censorship resistance**, not fast transactions.  
We already have Paypal, Visa, shitcoins... What makes Bitcoin special is that it is using decentralization to achieve this censorship resistance. Increasing blocksize immediately shuts down a lot of nodes from participating, thus making the network more centralized and easier to attack. Bitcoin focuses on this censorship resistance and tries innovating other possible solutions and efficiency upgrades to the network that will help scaling overall into the future. Bitcoin will increase block size when it is needed, it has already done this before many times, and consensus has proven that it is not yet needed. You can't argue with that logic because no one is using your forked shitcoin.
Fees are another thing entirely. The reason Bcash is so cheap is because there is no competition in their fee market. Block space is not necessarily a scarce resource to them which also makes incentive to  secure the network non-existent or highly centralized in the future when transaction fees outpace block rewards via halvenings.
Bcash already gave up 51% consensus in favor of a more centralized model.  
Wasn't the chain rolled back not so long ago?  
If I were you I would be insanely cautious about storing any kind of value on such a unsecured blockchain.
The reason Bcash is fast is because it is centralized, the reason it is cheap is because no one uses it.

Sound money is used to describe the way in which a money behaves.  
**Sound money** is **money** that is not prone to sudden appreciation or depreciation in purchasing power over the long term. One other definition is that Sound money is backed by a commodity or pegged to something else. So by definition Bitcoin is not really sound money. All the characteristics you are describing (inflation,POW,POS) Really have nothing to really do with anything other than security, centralization, and production. Intrinsic value is just what people make of anything based off of real world judgment and scrutiny of an object.

I've listened to him on Joe Rogan. I've also read his sub.  
Doesn't change my mind. The points he makes are trivial.  
The only way to get rid of poverty or to fix any problems in the world is to breed an environment where people have the freedom to achieve these goals. Stealing and extortion do not promote this idea.
Taxation takes away the ability for poor people to save capital and any money that is left over at the end of the day that could be used for savings is dwindled away through inflation by the federal reserve. This is the problem and this is mostly why I oppose Yang as president because he does not call for ending the federal reserve or the unconstitutional income tax. On top of not syncing with my values he wants to add insult to injury and tax more. Yang is ideologically different than everything Bitcoin even stands for. Yang is against Bitcoin, he wants to regulate it. I am not fooled by the rhetoric. and that is all it is, rhetoric.

For a time to come when Bitcoin can be traded for goods and services around the world as easily and privately as passing off cash in a locked room behind closed doors. When we can get paid our paychecks privately and directly in Bitcoin. When we no longer need exchanges and coinbases of the world to aquire Bitcoin. Some of us might even be jailed or worse in the future. But we are revolutionaries my brother. We must HODL.

**This is the best answer I have ever seen.** [**Source**](  


What was Bcash when it was created?  
In a nutshell,  
Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.  
This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.  
Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.  
Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.  
Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.  
Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.  
Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.  
Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.  
Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.  
By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?  
Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. Bcash developers even failed to remove SegWit related code completely. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.  
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed).  
Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.  
It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin\[dot\]com website, rBTC subreddit and  Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.  
There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC (BCH) and BcashSV (BSV). Bcash (BcashABC) was 51% attacked by two pools and its blockchain history was modified. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.

If you are actually asking why is the price of Bitcoin so Volatile it is because Bitcoin actually has a pretty low market cap from what it is designed to be.

Nobody is forcing you to use Amazon Or work for them. In fact in a free market you have every incentive to create a better company or organization if you think they are doing it wrong and the market will support you. Obviously the majority of the people in the world disagree with you because they choose to use Amazon every day. Amazon provides small business owners with an outlet to sell goods. Many people in 3rd world countries can use Amazon gift cards as a payment mechanism. When government runs a good or service there is moral hazard. No one is held accountable and the service has every incentive to be shit. Just like the thousands of other wealth distribution programs that have came before the one you are shilling now.

Lightning Network (LN) payment channels are anchored on the blockchain by their owners cooperatively creating a 2-of-2 multisig address and sending funds to it. This requires confirmation. The channel anchor then remains unchanged on the blockchain until the payment channel is closed. This also requires confirmation. Anything outside of that has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever and you are now playing by lightning protocols which has an entirely different transaction and security model. It isn't like a 0 config where you can just take back the bitcoin and scam someone, you are in a multisig address governed by the LN protocol.
Payments on the LN are subsequently performed by the channel owners renegotiating their balance shares of the anchor's funds. Thus, as long as payments are processed on LN, no on-chain action is required. If you don't find utility in this service, great, don't use it. It hasn't altered your Bitcoin or the liberty and security to transact on the blockchain whatsoever. complaining about payment channels is pretty pointless, they have existed in Bitcoin since day one. Ask Satoshi or a computer scientist about it if it upsets you for some reason.

That 1 BAT now gets put in the viewers wallet.(prices are off in this example but you get it.) That way there is no censorship, and it is fair and honest.

You have completely lost me.   
If you think prices should always remain stable in any market you clearly don't believe in a free market.  
I don't think anybody in the world is educated enough to comment on Bitcoin's price.  
Price doesn't concern me. I'm concerned with Bitcoin adoption and utility. But I'll entertain myself.  
Bitcoin's volatility is a result of it's extremely low market cap (compared to what it could be.)  
So obviously it doesn't take a large amount of money coming into space to swing the price.  
It's really that simple. Whales move the price by thousands daily. If you aren't used to it you haven't been in Bitcoin for very long. I've watched the price shoot up almost 2k in one day. I've watched it go down the same. But Bitcoin keeps chugging along, the fundamentals are all the same.  
MTGOX and Coinbase have nothing to do with Bitcoin Core.   
Whatever point you are trying to make is of little importance and I more or less agree about MtGOX tanking the price, but what point are you trying to make? I am not disagreeing with you that Bitcoin is Volatile.

Blockchains are horrible databases, so most use cases that involve applications or storage of large amounts of data are pretty pointless... money, contracts, timestamping, supplychain, and titling are all good use cases and all can be done on the most secure network in the world already.

Well Litecoin adopted Segwit first as a testnet which led to the adoption in Bitcoin that made Lightning Network possible. Monero, Grin, and other privacy coins are continuously researching new areas that could one day lead to more privacy options on Bitcoin. Pretty much every altcoin out there is a test to do something different or to find another way to make the technology work better. What is proving to be more difficult is actually finding a better way. Out of all the Altcoins, they only introduce even more problems then what they attempted to solve. Take Monero for example, They have solved privacy but at the cost of sacrificing technical features and more complex transactions that make things like the lightning network possible. Bcash, litecoin, digibyte, and SV have sacrificed decentralization for faster transactions. Ethereum sacrifices scalability for more technical features and more complex transactions. And so forth... It's all give and take when it comes to blockchain. Bitcoin is about as cutting edge as the technology gets. We are always just a fork away from something radically different or more advanced.

this is interesting as even if all the internet shut down globally, as long as the data exists and the nodes are eventually able to boot back up Bitcoin keeps chugging along.

Except you would have spent that money either way, and saved whatever money you did not spend. So why not use Bitcoin if it is viable? For both saving and spending? Why not ditch fiat altogether? Are you out of fiat entirely at this point? By your calculation every cent not stored on Bitcoin is costing you money now.

If Bitcoin needs legislation to be feasible we have all failed. Should just pack our bags and go home now. We have to many design problems to deal with and on top of it have to worry about asking permission to use it? Fuck us right? Thankfully I dont share that sentiment. Sure us early adopters are being tracked and watched, but we are making the ultimate sacrifice for everyone else when the time comes that people don't buy from coinbase or exchanges, it is just traded natually and anonymously in a counter economy.
"Where are your Bitcoins?" "-I lost them" "It says here you sent .000001 btc to purchase something?" 
"-That was my address and the keys are now lost, nothing was purchaced."
People think they are simply buying bitcoin, but when you convert back to fiat do you say you bought fiat with your bitcoin? You arnt buying anything. You are opting in and out of different systems. If you opted into Bitcoin, DO NOT opt back into fiat. That is how they get you. All of you "traders" are fucking yourselves. You play with Bitcoin like it is a fucking toy when in fact it is an atomic bomb. A weapon of the most dangerous caliber to the people who would fuck your life up faster than a lightning network transaction.

Seriously Blockstream is great and all but don't think for one second that I wouldn't change my opinion at any point in time. They are a company just like many others involved with Bitcoin. Anyways. I just found that very fishy and odd behavior for a mod to do for such a silly comment and extra weird because it was about Blockstream. What affiliation does a reddit mod have with Blockstream anywhoo? Just weird is all. I'll take off my tin foil hat for now.

Bitcoin is designed in such a way that it can be upgraded in both the signing algorithm and the hashing algorithm. Quantum computing or not, at some point we will need to change algorithms for one reason or another. Bitcoin could be hard forked but would no longer be backwards compatible with previous versions so I suspect a soft fork from ECDSA and SHA-256 would happen while changing the difficulty rules of SHA-256 at the same time.
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:34:39
Historically, you have a 99% chance of profiting by buying now rather than waiting later. The type of investing that Bitcoin is, a few hundred dollars is not going to make a difference.  Just buy when your ready and dont let the ups and downs consume you.

Bitcoin is constantly trying to increase capacity with efficiency upgrades. If all else fails we could just increase Blocksize here and there as a last resort. I just don't think it is really needed at the moment. There is also a thing called decentralized aggregation pools that you could join on lightning and would let you get out for a lot cheaper by batching closing channel transactions together, also helping the network. If Bitcoin ends up being some kind of secure savings/bank vault and lightning network is the main way to transact Bitcoin like cash or cc. All of these services are the wallets job to streamline so it would work as simply as sending and recieving Bitcoin without you knowing much of the technical details behind it.

People who use lightning do so at various trade offs. One responsibility they might have to incur is checking their channel every so many days. It's yet to be seen even how lightning will be utilized. Will channels act more long term or short term? How will people incorporate other technologies within it? It is an interesting concept.   
Blockchain has a lot of inherent problems and there are a lot of possible solutions. Each with their own unique advantages and disadvantages. We know security, decentralization, and scalability are the 3 pillars of blockchain we can work on. We know the problem is when you go to far in any direction you do so at the cost of the others. To say there is one perfect solution is just a flat out lie. Either someone has lied to you or you are lieing to everyone. There is also no trying to argue or plead to anyone about any one solution because consensus has already looked at the facts and made up it's mind. The only people who decide the fate of bitcoin are the node operators. Miners don't decide, devs don't decide. It is the users that decide the fate of Bitcoin. To say Bitcoin is "this" or to say Bitcoin is "that" is rather foolish. Bitcoin could be taken down tomorrow and we could just make another one and it would still be Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an idea only, not a thing. It is a consensus algorithm. Most importantly it's the users who are finding actual utility in it. And the price and dominance speaks for itself.

Probably a bitmain recyclable that would otherwise be in a landfill but they scammedyou into buying it. A decent rig is going to cost you in the order of a few thousand dollars minimum for just 1. You need several. You will have gone through all the trouble of setting it up and getting it going to find out you are making fractions of a penny in Bitcoin a day while paying 10x that in electrical costs, internet, running a full node, time, etc. As each month goes by you will become even less and less relevant in your pool as your hardware becomes ancient as hell. You arnt really helping the network being such a lightweight either because you will get pushed over easily by legitimate mining companies who own millions of miners. The node you run will be the only saving grace to this entire pipedream. As your node will help verify transactions and keep the network healthy.
