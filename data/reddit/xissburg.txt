Over the past few days I have been in contact with the COO of Advcash who’s been negotiating a chargeback with their card issuer. Wavecrest declined the request and we have come to an agreement where Advcash will reimburse me for 50% of the value that was lost, which is possibly a deal that’s good for both parties I guess. It’s sad but I’ll have to deal with this loss.
The conclusion is, never let significant amounts laying around in your card, and setup instant notifications to your email and SMS notifications to your mobile phone to track your transactions.
When I first posted this issue here I was very upset of course and said that I had lost trust in Advcash but I changed my mind now that I can see that this company is backed by real people with the aim of providing us a good product/service. I still have another Advcash card and will continue to use it, with care.
Big thanks to Advcash for doing what was possible in this tricky case.

Yes because that's not the interest of politicians. They have their own personal interests to fulfill before yours. We're all egotistical.

You must not be aware of where the money you give to govt goes. You can only think of roads, hospitals, schools (which are regulated to indoctrinate you so you agree with only what the govt wants to, e.g. that taxation is necessary and that the govt is great), etc. But there's a lot more to it obviously. You can easily do some research and find where the tax money is being spent and I'm sure you do not support any of those things.

That's excellent. When you pay taxes you're contributing with the biggest criminal organization in the planet. The less money the state has the better. ALL THE GLORY TO THE TAX EVADERS!! GOD BLESS

You should be ashamed of yourself for laughing at someone who goes to prison because of not paying taxes. You're a thief just like the govt.

"No regulations were introduced to prevent this from ever happening again"... this all happens because of regulations in first place.

There's no such thing as a capable president. Any president is just the boss of the biggest criminal organization. Plus it's impossible for a person to organize or plan a society. To claim one is capable of doing so is just an incredible degree of arrogance.

At least "taxation is theft" is logical and obvious, whereas your "argument" isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:09:08
You're a dreamer. That's total utopia.

Taxation is theft.

The amount you pay is irrelevant. They forcibly take the money from you with threats of violence. Then they use this money to fund things you don't even agree with, things that go against your will, against your core principles, against humanity.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:12:04
I have to say the same about what you just said.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:20
US != US Govt....

Not as selfish as you who would go as far as stealing money from people to fulfill your personal interests because you're arrogant enough to think you know what's better for society.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:13:53
The nature of the tax is irrelevant. In all cases you're being forced to pay with threats of violence. Plus, the money they get from you is mostly used to support things you certainly don't agree with.

Taxation is theft. Fair share is when you voluntarily work, serving society and getting paid for it. Taxation is no such thing as fair share.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:18
That's what you think. That's the tip of the iceberg. When you pay taxes you're supporting the biggest criminal organization in the planet, especially if you're american.

Well the statist mindset dominates, after all we have all been indoctrinated to think this way and it can be difficult to see the other side. However there's a growing discussion around this, people are questioning themselves. I guess bitcoin helps bringing this type of questioning into every conversation. There's still hope.

I am posting this here for advice and most importantly to warn people about this. Like I said I used to recommend Advcash to others, now it's my duty to unrecommend it.

I contacted MasterCard and they tell me to contact the card issuer. I will have to try again...

I contacted the number a couple times and it's actually MyChoice. When I choose the option to talk to somebody nobody is available.

Taxation is theft. You worry about the poor and the elderly go help them. You want to do charity with other's people money? With my money? Yeah, go fuck yourself, THIEF

Yeah, fuck america... the land of the free.. NOT. It's sad how it's become simply a fascist totalitarian state. A country that was once built on the concepts of freedom... really sad what it's become...

Why does the government has to even care about bitcoin at all? Why do they have to put their hands on everything and regulate everyfuckingthing? Leave us alone. I cringe when I see people cheering when a government guy says or does something in favor of bitcoin... the best thing they can possibly do is to stay away from it.

Just posting an update. I am in contact with the COO of Advcash and he said that it's very unlikely that the card vendor will do a chargeback because the fraudulent transactions were ATM withdrawals where the PIN was used. Anyway, they'll try to negotiate something with the card vendor and see what they can do to resolve the situation.
Apparently they're trying something instead of ignoring the situation, so that's good. Now we wait..
