What about the people who saw their bitcoin lose half its value and will continue to lose value as this unfolds?  "Robbing" people to bailout MtGox would keep the price stable and then people who have nothing to do with MtGox would not lose all of the value in their internet play money. Bailouts happen for a reason and you can just look at other exchanges to see that.

In Indiana casinos, no casino had less than $30 million wagered in a month on just the penny slots. The casino with the most wagered had $100 million in that month JUST from their penny slots.
Amount wagered looks impressive if you don't know what you are talking about. You put 100 bitcoins in, get 95 back, then put 95 in again. So now you have wagered 195 bitcoins.
You guys are a worldwide business but you cannot compete on wagered amounts with ANY casino in the united states. Even missouri casinos have $100mill wagered on their penny slots in a month.
Every state gambling commission reports the exact amount that each casino has wagered at it every month. Anyone who thinks this $20 million is impressive just has to pick a random casino in the US and you will see how small it actually is. Bitcoin casinos are like a mom and pop corner store and you are trying to claim that they will revolutionize the grocery store industry.

Regardless, the new regulations do not change anything about how the US banking system works. Our FDIC already fits all of the new requirements.

MT.Gox is what happens when banks don't get "saved". So the depositors would get nothing at all if banks went through a traditional bankruptcy.
One Cyprus bank was allowed to fail like how you suggest. The depositors got back 20% of their funds after it was all done because that is how bankruptcies work.
The people who got the haircut: 40% of their money was taken from them and they received 60%.
But the 40% haircut was given to them in the form of bank stock. They now own 80% of the new bank. Anyone who owned the bank before lost everything. So the haircut people now control the board of directors of the new bank.
It is the same entity in name and function only. All previous owners were wiped out and the unsecured depositors from before now own the bank.

They covered all insured deposits. They did not takeover the banks which is what they usually do, but all deposits were covered. If they run out of funds they get loans from the treasury to cover all insured deposits.

It is fully funded by the member banks. 
If the FDIC were to run out of money, similar to if an insurance company went bankrupt, they are authorized to borrow from the Treasury. The last time this happened was in 1991. They are then required to pay it back with interest, which they have always done. They pay it back by making the banks pay a higher premium.

The bulbs themselves become points of centralization. People should only be able to buy a single bulb as a group. Then make them sign an agreement that says they will move the bulb to each others houses after a certain period of time. We can track the time logs using either colored coins or a sidechain. This way the bulb itself will become decentralized.
Oh and the houses it rotates between have to use different electric companies. We don't want a centralized power company controlling the bulbs.


We'll probably need to use something like the torrent protocol to get this thing off the ground. We can't have a single builder for this thing so we need to have each part built in a separate factory. Use Alibaba to start finding factories around the world who can assemble this thing.

If this is a challenge, if you simply cannot imagine how a person can actually use bitcoin over a two year period, then I concede. I'm not going to argue or prove how one can actually use bitcoin.


The point of posting the article was to pretend that bitcoin has some huge demand. Again, I will concede, and you and any casual investor is free to invest in these startups.

WU is not gouging the poor. They transfer money across the world and give people cash. Bitcoin cannot do that currently.

@_date: 2014-01-03 21:49:56


That does not matter when you have a business to run. If you have 50btc in your business account and you have to pay your suppliers or any other expenses at the end of the month, you will go bankrupt when those 50 coins become the equivalent of 25btc suddenly and you can  no longer pay your bills. And it wont matter if the price shoots up again next month because you would have already used those 50btc(worth25btc) to pay your bills plus you now have a debt that you took out to cover those bills you couldnt pay.


Few accept bitcoins. Most accept a payment processor that accepts bitcoins.

You people don't understand that trustlessness only applies to the nature of the currency. It has nothing to do with when you actually try to spend it. For that you do need trust. You need to trust that the sellers is not going to rip you off. Mastercard makes it so that you don't have to trust the seller because Mastercard will give you your money back if he scams you.

At least that way, Penn Jillette does not have to hire a lawyer and an accountant to discuss the risks of accepting bitpay as a processor. And he does not have to set up meetings with bitpay's people to set the whole thing up. All for maybe at the most optimistic, a few hundred extra dollars in revenue.

He actually doesn't get it. The 3% savings is hidden from the business and customer right now, but that doesn't mean a bitcoin transaction is 3% cheaper. There is an energy cost that is far more than 3% of the transaction value.  You can't say it is going to impact the global economy if the costs are just shifted from banks to miners because both are part of the global economy.
The blockchain is disturbingly inefficient and would be a net drain on the global economy if everyone shifted to it.

One of the Cyprus banks was allowed to fail "like any business". The depositors there got only 20% of their funds back.
The people who got the haircut, received 60% of their unsecured depositis and the other 40% was given to them as shares in the bank. They literally now own the bank. They control 80% of the shareholder votes and they elected the entire board of directors.

Build a mining farm equal to the current hashrate/miners. Don't start mining with it yet.
Publicly announce that the government will be mining bitcoins with the goal of having more that 50% of the hashing power so that the government will be able to prevent criminals from using bitcoins.
Wait a day for the price to collapse which will cause most miners to stop. Then, turn on your asic stockpile and control nearly all of the hashrate.
Then announce you will be blacklisting any coins found to have been used in illegal transactions. At that point bitcoin would be literally worthless, so no private citizens will be mining and no mining businesses will mine because they cannot compete with the deep pockets of the US with such a low/non-existent price.

People don't own just one bitcoin. What people do is they buy in for a set amount. A person has $100 to invest in bitcoin. In 2011 that will buy him 3 BTC. In 2014 that would buy him 0.3 bitcoin.
From his perspective, he loses $90 in each of those years after the price drops 90%.
People don't say "Oh im going to buy exactly one BTC. Oh look the price is $30 so I will invest $30. Or now the price is $300 so I guess I have to invest $300." People have a set amount of USD to invest. A 90% drop will affect that USD investment no matter the price of BTC.

It is the fruit of your labor being turned into a piece of paper that doesn't help people of tomorrow. Everyone's labor is building towards the future, but then you trade it for paper ( or bitcoin). Once you trade it, then the paper becomes a representation of your labor during that specific time period. It is the paper(bitcoin) that is worthless to the people in 100 years.


Yes. Anything real like gold or real estate or cars or companies. Currency is not real. Whether it is USD or Bitcoin, it represents labor for your specific society. The way to translate that into value for a 100 year future society is to buy real things.
So you use your paper to buy real things and then you have real value in 100 years. You do not keep the paper and cry that no one accepts it in 100 years.

Look at the rate that computers have increased efficiency over the last 20 years and the rates that bitcoin mining difficulty has increased over the last two years.

If they lose your coins, due to poor management or theft, you can't sue them. They will go bankrupt. They wont have your coins because they lost them. Investors and people who gave them business loans will be the first in the line to get repaid. So if they lose your coins you are the last in the line to get repaid during the bankruptcy.
Coinbase is physically moving bitcoins around 
It isnt hard to imagine a scenario where they lose these due to theft during the transfer. 
It also is not hard to imagine a new startup going under due to poor management. Coinbase has to constantly buy and sell bitcoins and poor management can result in them losing money due to differences in exchange rates. If they lose a few bitcoins during this process then they can keep on trading due to the cash coming in. But they won't have 100% of bitcoins in their possession. Do this enough times and it can spiral out of control with the result being they only have like 50% of customer bitcoins on hand.

Why would anyone want to cash out? If you have bitcoin just send them to your family in poland instantly without a third party. Or just take all of your bitcoins and divide them into a million little satoshi bits.

Why dont you just convert the bitcoins to doallrs yourself and then buy it yourself? That is exactly what steambits is going to do.

Oh so for bitcoin to be useful for a merchant they have to sign up with a payment processor...like the credit card system that you think is terribly hard/inefficient for merchants.
