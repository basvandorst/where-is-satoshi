Never saw that before. is that still an issue?
I visit r/bitcoin quite often lately, so I really prefer to think I just missed it somehow then it has been muted.
Is there somewhere I can look for to see for other possible pending issues/vulnerabilities?

OK, I've posted this comment as a joke. but I get it: you arrogant fucks obviously don't like/understand TA ("arrogant fucks" was added as an attempt to get some of that lovely reddit spirit)
To me, TA is just a way to understand trends and I have some interest learning some of the indicators, which make some sense if you try to understand why they where build the way they are.
I'm not considering myself even as a TA noob, so I won't try to defend it farther. but you guys are obviously talking out of your asses (I'm on a roll here, am I?)
Keep doing important stuff.

It might work sometimes.. 
But really, it can ease your soul with more excuses why you've made the decisions you've made. and those bollinger bands and Aroon are so fun to watch.

What if the head of NASA said bitcoin is going to the moon?

Bitcoin is yet to be proven as a currency. not so sure that "bigger" and "older" are what you want to look for in innovative spaces.

I agree that we need to address Bitcoin's smaller units. 
but 'bits' could be slang for Bitcoins and as such it cannot describe a smaller unit.
I suggest '**mibs**' for a slang as in **mi**lli-**B**itcoin (mB).
One Bitcoin= 1,000 mibs. or mB as the official marking. 
that way you can keep saying milliBitcoins as a known unit, but still have a unique way to address it.

Are you sure it sounds stupid, or you just not used to its sound?
I imagine it sound like the british slang for Pound sterling 'quids'

Should be pronounced "mibs", as in "Gimme 20 mibs".
