Obviously, someone shouldered the pain for your "savings" - all for gaining bitcoin. Or maybe the money wasn't theirs to begin with.

I know. I was a purse buyer too (when I tried the 30 day amazon prime for free shipping). I myself only fulfill orders with max. 20% discount. Whenever I see an order asking beyond 20% discount, I give it a finger.

Someone willing to trade their credit card money for your bitcoin 50% off its value, looks so shady in every angle. I'm getting a feeling someone else took a huge blow for your huge discount.

Purse customer support is not answering. I'm an amazon spender. USPS wasn't able to deliver the package to the gift recipient due to  "business close". The package is still in usps facility waiting to be received. 
I posted message to the order for the buyer to see, but the buyer isn't responding - for 2 days now. I contacted the support about the issue, but they aren't replying either, it's like they suddenly got stroke and died on spot. 
Now I'm trying to return the item to amazon to get a refund, but the package is still with usps, looks troublesome. Should I wait for a week for a response or should I bug them on their social media accounts?
-- edit: After contacting amazon support; who called the usps. The package is now delivered, but the buyer and the support is still not responding.
-- edit: the buyer confirmed the package and the transaction is now closed. Got paid. The end.

As a seller on purse, you have to take note of the following:
- Shipping; most buyers don't add shipping to their orders, most expects it to be free. If the order has no shipping included, cancel it and add the shipping fee to the note.
- Delivery time; if the delivery time is more than 2 weeks, cancel it!
- Be wary of those with at least RED feedback. I'm having  trouble with that kind of buyer right now. They're not worth it.
20% and below discounts in US are often filled fast. As a seller on purse, I only fill cheap orders and 20% below discounts.
