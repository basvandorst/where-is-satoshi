Even though it might not be "big money", you're getting into the habit of saving money and "you have to start somewhere" :)
I earn a decent wage (higher than average for my country) rent's pretty cheap for my city, no kids, no car, and I still managed to burn through my wage pretty much every month - if there was money left when the next paycheck was about to come in, I spent it. I bought all the toys I wanted and it felt awesome! 
I had about two months' worth of pay in an emergency account, but that was it, but for some reason I got interested in investing. I'm not really sure why, I guess I just ran out of things to buy for the time being. Anyway, I started investing in stocks and a number of index funds every month as soon as I got my paycheck. It kind of sucked at first, since all I got to do with my hard earned money was to just put them away as soon as I got them. But as my savings account started to grow I realized I got about the same amount of satisfaction from saving money that I got from spending money, so I kept at it and I've started to save even more money every month than before.
I always transfer at least 20% of my wage as soon as it hits my bank account to my savings account, and after all the bills are paid I transfer that's months budgeted spendings to my credit card account. I really don't use any credit (ever!), and I wouldn't recommend anyone to do it, I just do it because they pay me a 2 % interest rate while I keep my money there, as well as a 1 % cash back on everything I buy.
I always keep up with the balance as to not actually buy something on credit and have to pay interests. 
In a little over a year, I've gone from spending almost all of my money, to saving a lot of money. My only regret is that I didn't start sooner :)
