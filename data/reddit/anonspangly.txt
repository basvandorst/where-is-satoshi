You could do a [Paper Wallet]( - print, cut, fold and seal and load it up with the agreed value of BTC.
When you meet your buyer, you or he would use the Blockchain app on your smartphone to scan the Public Key code - this will demonstrate that the hidden Private Key has the promised value. At this point, I would suggest they then hand over the money to you. They then un-seal the Private Key part and import the private key (the Blockchain app can do this via QR code very quickly).
Best security practice would be that they immediately transfer the money from the address of the Paper Wallet to one of their own - because it's *possible* that you're a bad person, kept a copy of the private key, and will go "take back" the BTC before they could do their own transfer.
It's probably easier to just go app-to-app as you're meeting in person - would also be more efficient as you would then only need to incur one transaction fee in total (rather than you doing one to load the Paper Wallet address, and then your buyer doing another to empty it). But, as your BTC is currently held locally on your PC, you'd incur a fee to push it to a Blockchain wallet...
Also, MtGox I believe also do an app with integration to their accounts and online wallets, so that may also be usable for mobile transfer (similar to what people have suggested with Blockchain).
Long story short, I suggest you ask your buyer if they have a preferred way of doing the transfer.
