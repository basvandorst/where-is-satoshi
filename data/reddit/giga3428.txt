You are young, don't be short sighted - bitcoins are not "beer money".
You have more than one bitcoin? Buy a Trezor and leave them alone somewhere.  Concentrate on your studies.  In 10 years, you will be making more money with those bitcoins than your "diploma" will...

Thank you Mike Hearn for your contribution to Bitcoin.  It has to be recognized.  However, younger, smarter people will replace you. Even before Satoshi, the "Bitcoin" concept was imagined by hundreds of bright people.  Satoshi made it possible, but thousands of people made it reality by stepping in.  Bitcoin is a community project, not a single man project. When Satoshi left the project, quietly, he proved it.   
Hearn should have been so humble.

Instead, we need a solution like Raistone proposes, where the keys are never held by the exchange.  Under Raistone proposal, the exchange only matches traders (see it as a Match.com dating service).  The trade is settled between the traders themselves, it is the exchange that triggers the bilateral trade: Bilateral on-blockchain trades.

You are correct - I have edited my post. Thanks.

Encompass is a fork of Electrum and they enable multi currencies with your Trezor - for the currencies supported by Trezor firmware (currently 5 of them). Therefore, I hold my Bitcoins, Litecoins, and Dash all in the same Trezor, using the same wallet interface!  I select "Change Currency" in the menu and have access to the independantly operated Electrum-Servers for BTC, LTC and DASH.
Encompass is also working on having your Trezor being one of the signatory of a multi signature wallet.  Trezor's firmware allows it, but no wallet (not even Electrum) has come up with an implementation of it yet - and it will be with multi-currencies support.
Edit: Dogecoin is supported with Encompass and Trezor, but no Electrum-servers are up and running at time of writing.

I am not sure if I should ditch Windows and get myself a Mac. Indecision!

The .dmg file only includes the GUI binary.   
The ...osx64.tar.gz file includes the GUI (bitcoin-qt), the daemon binary (bitcoind), and the command line binary (bitcoin-cli) for use in the terminal.

Just download the Mac version from bitcoin.org website. Double-click on the .dmg file, drag the Bitcoin-core icon to the Application folder.  If you already have an older copy of Bitcoin-core in your folder, it will ask you if you want to replace it - click Yes.

Stay on Windows - please don't migrate to OSX or Linux... otherwise the virus creators will migrate too... can they?

On paper... 
- no button to cancel (Trezor has two buttons, one to confirm, one to cancel)
- no Github repo to check and validate firmware (red flag - "will be up soon")
- why announce the product before it is ready for order, specially if it is a copycat of Trezor hardware and software (another red flag)
-  no physical address or phone number on their website (red flag?)
