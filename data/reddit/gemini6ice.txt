You know there is right? ;)

I thought most merchants who accept bitcoin immediately convert to fiat.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:12:03
I *wish* the price were 600 factorial...

Heaven forbid we have any levity in the conversation.

So primarily the turnaround time on orders. I hadn't heard about the latter part. That's pretty awful! Thanks!

Ah, and transaction fees are a transacter-chosen amount when making the transaction? I'm still trying to acquire BTC to begin using them, so I haven't gotten to make a transaction yet.
(and thank you!)
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:34:25
Oh! Yes, then I was mistaken! Thank you!

I don't understand why anyone would want meaningless retweets... What's the point? It's like buying friends.

As a child whose parents are like you but who could use the money (seriously), how can I convince them to take money from me? :/ What tactics/arguments would work on you?

Now what about bars that explicitly accept bitcoin payments for your check? ;)

I'm 29 and my "life savings" is 6k. So jealous right now :p

However, if you never convert them back but just spend them on goods and services...
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:55:39
By that logic, wouldn't any trade or barter qualify as well?
I would think it would make more sense that I should pay sales tax on those purchases...

Wont it be a transaction-verifying problem when there are no coins left to be mined...?
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:35:29
Does including more transactions actually make mining the block easier?
@_date: 2013-07-08 02:39:06
Can you elaborate on why coinbase leaves a bad taste in your mouth? More than the lawsuit against Mt Gox?
@_date: 2013-06-28 13:56:47
Aha! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:02:25
Once all bitcoins are mined, will "miners" simply ignore feeless or low-fee transactions since they won't contribute to the reward?
@_date: 2013-08-20 23:55:14
And kids are a huge expense! I just have guinea pigs...
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:05:09
I'm interested. But I'm also risk-averse, so I'll be watching this new exchange with curiosity :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:26:03
As anecdotal evidence, I've been using bitcoins to buy a few MTG cards the last few months. :)
