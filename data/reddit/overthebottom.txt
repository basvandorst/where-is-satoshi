How do you expect doge to go up longterm in value when there is such a high inflation? 
I dont know if its true, but I read its fixed at 5% yearly inflation.
In a few months or few years it could and probably will hyperinflate like most other altcoins.
 
Unlike every other currency in this world that is constantly printed, Bitcoin was the first digital currency to have a cap that makes it predictable. 
Thats why people can trust it to longterm hold and gain in value.
You can not put any such trust in Doge coin?
Its almost impossible for Bitcoin to not gain in value longterm if it only stays alive after a while those who sell their coins cheap will be gone. 
The opposite is true for doge. Its impossible for doge to not go down in value longterm as more of it is always printed.
Doge have to have a constant new stream of users buying it in order for it to hold or gain in value. 
I´m not against doge though, as it makes it possible for people to mine bitcoins, by converting their doge to bitcoins. 
However I would never buy doge with bitcoins as bitcoin is better in every aspect. It has more secure network, bigger merchant adoption and less inflation.
I have a hard time understanding how people can be so ignorant that they go for dogecoins instead of bitcoins? Please let me know why?
It feels like a way to trick kids from their allowance. Whereas in bitcoin everything in the design of it is really thought through, by the most brilliant minds.
You want to be an early adopter. 
You still are. Less than one in 10.000 have a bitcoin most people on this earth have no clue as to what bitcoin is.

6% unless you get 4% interest on your money at your bank thats really bad. With only 3% inflation after interest, you will need to remake 25% of all the work you did 10 years ago. 
Example. You paint 4 walls, 10 years later you only get 3 walls for the money. 
You need to paint 5 walls in order to get someone to paint your 4 walls. 
The money quickly forget the work you do with such high inflation.

You can book hotels all over the world.
Rent apartments
Save as much as you can of those Bitcoins, they can easily go up 10 times in value the coming years, where old money always drops in value because more and more is created all the time, it never ends.
Fiat money, such as Euro, is created by private banks when someone takes a loan.
Because there is more and more money the value of the money decrease, thats why you pay more for an item today than when you where a child and in a few years you will pay more.
But there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins and they are also the worlds first real digital money that people can own themselves.
