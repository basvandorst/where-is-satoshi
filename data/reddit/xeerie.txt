Almost the same safety level is possible by creating multisig wallet on two or more devices.
Main cool feature (not sure to call it a killer-feature or not) you made is ability to keep second device offline.
I'm finding hardware wallets a less secure way to hodl because of need to keep safe your piece of  paper with seed, security cards etc.
If you lost your piece of paper you lose private key, so the risks are still high. 
Offline phone with hardware cold storage, or your solution with offline transaction signing with second phone looks more reliable IMO.
Hope for your good will, so wish you a good luck!
I'll definitely will give your wallet a try.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:37:37
Ah, multisig wallets are also need seeds to be backed up, of course.
I do not think that any 100% risk-free solutions are exist.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:34:35
BitPay and Electrum wallets are very handy for the  purpose.  Making multisig wallet with BitPay is also a pretty simple and clear.

Division never produces multiplication.
Just by it's nature.
Look at Ethereum, look at separatists all over the world, look at British pound after Brexit.
Hardforking multiplies amount of chains, complexity, entropy and amount of data to store. 
I hope Bitcoin will never go this way.

My beliefs are based on many things. For example you may look at hashrate graph and notice that it grows constantly. 
Some people were still building mining-centers spending billions dollars. 
Moreover mining-centers construction did not stop construction even when price was dropped from $1200 to $200.
Think about it.

I don't think so. Keep calm +-$30 jumps is a norm.
Bitcoin still too young currency,  such situation is very possible for few more years.
And as already said 1000s times before, do not buy Bitcoins if you're not sure, do not spend  sum bigger than  that you are ready to lose.  
Especially if you're new to Bitcoins.  
I see no reasons to panic, and i totally trust Bitcoin, but even i think that spending all of your money for Bitcoins is a bad idea.
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:42:42
Yeah, you are right. But. There is no problem to buy any storage, there are a lot of cheap solutions. 
The main questions are:
How will it affect on decentralization?
What can motivate average user to buy hardware just to store blockchain? 
If Bitcoin became government approved currency most people will never learn how blockchain works.

Hmm sounds nice. Decentralize decentralized database. 
Cutting blockchain into pieces and store some variable number of each piece's copies on thousands devices across network. 
I think such methods need too complex code.
Simple code always has less bugs. 
Ethereum is a great example of complex system  that fucked itself.

Nope, Bitcoin does not grow exponentially yet.
High peaks are just speculations, as you correctly said.
I'm absolutely sure soon we'll see how exponential grow really looks.
If you look back you will see all cool startups and great companies, like Facebook, like Apple App Store (and a lot of other Apple products), Google, etc reached some point and when it happened they started to grow incredible fast. 
Bitcoin seems now very close to same "point of exponential expansion".

Moreover i'm sure that fingerprinting and other dirty tricks are just the "top of the iceberg".
For example:

Google not just tracks you, all your google accounts are linked, even if you use em on different devices.
Checked personally. I hate that shit.

Depends on your local laws. 
As far as i know there are no any problems to  buy Bitcoins in EU, finally you can try to buy on LocalBitcoins, if no other options left. But exchange rate would be much higher. 
If you don't want to show passport LocalBitcoins may be the only way to make deal quick.

This act is not good for Bitcoin.
PrivatBank is the largest bank in Ukraine, and it's also the most progressive bank (was).
There are Privat24 website and mobile apps that have already supported Bitcoin.
Wallet and online exchange are also built in, so any Privat24 user may buy/sell Bitcoin directly.
I'm totally sure the government will restrict these abilities or, at least, would try to control people's finances.

Nope. Most of things are just look complicated, but in fact they are not. 
My advice is to make first two transactions, receive (usually receiving is first if you are not miner heh), and send (you may send some satoshies to yourself).

3. It's conception geniality, beauty, and simplicity (yes, the idea is pretty simple).
4. Very easy to use! You can feel and see it after you make your first two (receive and send) transactions.
5. When you die you can't take your bucks/gold/cards/accounts with you. But can take Bitcoins.

I'm noob, but i'm able man, i learn quick.
Thanks for the answer. 
Don't you find a bit strange that my noob question fired such a discussion? 
Does it mean that Bitcoin and it's blockchain  structure are still unclear for most members?  
Or may be the question isn't so simple?
I heard and read a lot rational, clear and logic explanations of why Bitcoin is awesome, and i totally trust em, at the other side 99% negative talks are growing from one single root.
Root made of misunderstanding, lack of knowledge and finally just nobody knows exactly what to expect. 
When i see another analytic's article with graphics, and  predictions i just smile.
While the protocol, SHA256 functions and whole network is functioning the way it should, i see no reason to worry of volatility and price drops.
All attacks and "bitcoin is dead" rumors since 2009 was ineffective, and  even  make Bitcoin stronger, cause it's the best way to conquer trust.
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:18:32
"This is nothing what you see today, the worst will come.

@_date: 2016-11-20 10:20:26
Price will fall again and rise again and fall until we use it for speculations.
Did you buy something for bitcoin recently?
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:25:59
You are right. 
Too many reads-and-writes is not good for SSD, and blockchain also doesn't need too fast access to stored data.
@_date: 2016-12-19 02:04:06
I always do both, have some coins to HODL, and often spend, mostly for donations.
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:13:05
Anybody going to squirt at 800?
There are less than 3 girls between 100 Bitcoin users. I forgot this fact.
@_date: 2016-11-18 20:44:59
It's obvious, but i think about it's monopoly for data. For a Big Data. 
Their services aren't free.

Great answer. Thanks. Time to forget this thread.

I use Brave for about two or three weeks, and i like it, the only feature that i miss is a cloud sync. 
And maybe extensions. But soon they will add both.
Browser is really fast and lightweight.

Wow, really great news, but deleted LOL
Better to make screenshot next time.
@_date: 2016-11-03 00:08:41
Step by step. I agree. Also Bitcoin revolution seems going right now in charts.
@_date: 2016-11-05 03:35:49
Yeah, i know about SegWit, but still have a lot of white spaces in my knowledges. Just asked to be sure.
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:53:47
No other bank in Ukraine with such a great Bitcoin integration.
Anyway, we will see.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:21:49
Hell, such shit periodically appears in news for about last ten years or so.
Can someone give us a clear explanation of  how exactly QC able to crack SHA256?
 And how cracked SHA256 will affect Bitcoin?
As far as i understand it will make mining lightning-speed, but 16kk Bitcoins are already mined. 
Is it possible to change whole blockchain with QC?
I do not see any possibility.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:21:07
OP, i have the same question.
Who is a scammer? And where is the scam on this screenshot?
@_date: 2016-11-18 23:41:58
Absolutely awesome idea! Bravo!

Greedy FUD-believers buying bcrash do the same. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 01:15:23
Same shit here, bro. SegWit may became a trigger for big changes.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:01:05
Ok. So...That means Circle is definitely even more shitty than i think before. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:26:41
When can we see it on this graph?
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:16:09
OP, can you add some proof? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:36:42
Oh, once i've heard a phrase like this: "Happy people look similar, but every unhappiness has it's own face"
It seems wrong now, lol.
Anyway, every time i think about people living  in countries like North Korea or Somalia,  Venezuela, i feel wish to say thanks to the universe. There are a lot places much worse than Ukraine. I hate some things here, but i love my fatherland, and i hope for changes at last.

Ok. 
Anyway it's not good when one suspended service causes a lot of panic.
@_date: 2016-12-08 09:18:36
Then why so much butthurt in this sub since circle.io stopped?
Are all of these comments like "Without Circle Bitcoin is a pain in the ass!" written by trolls?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:29:13
Seems everything is possible. Some people are just so awful motherfuckers which can do unpredictable by normal people actions. It is possible by all means.

Asking yourself why all these people are investing in Bitcoin.
English is not my native lang, thanks for correction btw.
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:33:08
Agree. SegWit is a fuel to fill Bitcoin rocket to the moon. 
Hardfork obviously will drop price to the ground, because there are a lot of altcoins already waiting.
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:37:44
No, seems problems with their fiat banking.
Bitcoins are available to move out.
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:12:14
The OP's idea is not exactly the same as ETH.
As far as i understand OP means local machine third-party code execution while the code itself stored over blockchain and accessed by addresses. Anyway i do not see it someway useful yet.
OP called it a language, but it looks much more like some blockchained frameworks or APIs, not a language.
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:30:09
Nobody knows.

Why not to support the side that will throw price up instead?
@_date: 2017-04-22 12:51:11
I'm strongly recommend to all Bitcoin hodlers to buy something or donate some bits at least once a week or two. 
Let Bitcoin flow, stimulate merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment.
Doing so you increase Bitcoin price and it's value. 
I'm also hate Bitcoin and gold comparisons. They have a lot more differences than similarities.

Is it an active wallets usage stats?

@_date: 2017-04-22 20:20:26
 Most people download updates as binaries (APK's, packages, etc) so it's really possible case when software/hardware developers release new version with a lot of changes. 
While few curious coders are checking code thousands installing update and...
How can developers prove they are honest (except public persons)?
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:03:20
Jihan's manipulations, Ver's promises, PR, FUD, stupid bugs in BU... 
Is there someone still not bored of this shit?
SegWit has no real alternatives.  
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:05:20
Sure! You are right.
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:34:56

Oh you! OP, do you really  think you are the first person asking this?
Just lurk what Bill Gates said about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:38:35
I do not mean Trezor! 
If you read my upper comment i told about software wallets first.
@_date: 2017-04-22 12:55:24
Great words, bro. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:20:12
The innovation is an advantage for a short term. 
But the real difference between Bitcoin and all other CCs is an absence of real author.
@_date: 2017-04-24 06:39:27
Would it been fake nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-22 12:28:06
Wow! Yesterday i've had exactly same thoughts but about mobile wallets. 
How many people are use wallets downloaded as a ready to use app, and how many are personally compiling open source wallets?   
How many of those who compiled have been looking deep into code?
What if users of one of well-known apps after next update get empty wallets?

Yes, you can. It looks complicated at first, but after you made your first transaction, you'll see how simple and cool it is.
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:14:56


Yeah. Many other creators of altcoins are feel themselves as a masters of the universe. Bitcoin Core team is different, most are look as reliable people. I respect em.

@_date: 2017-09-07 07:33:56
Can you give us a bit more detailed explanation of this? It would be great post. I’m pretty sure many of us are interested in LN and need a better understanding.
I’ve heard many times about LN centralization issues, but never seen a good explanation.
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:17:55
1. Make a pump-announcement group
2. Invite people
3. Announce few cheap shitcoin pumps to prove your "predictions", buy cheap shitcoin to make price grow.
4. Buy some next shitcoin slowly
5. Announce its pump
6. Group members start to buy making the announced pump
7. Sell on the price peak
8. PROFIT
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:34:29
At the moment it was about $350, today it worth much more. Arrrrgghh
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:20:17
Looks like the Bitcoin Core software is  overcomplicated . Are there any experienced coders able to watch for its bugs?
It’s like a challenge now, i think white hat hackers should be rewarded for their work. 
IMO we need some kind of foundation to collect donations of their rewards. What do you think, guys?
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:25:55

Would be nice if someone tells his experience.
And how risky is to use this service?
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:43:44
Awesome! 
Most of bitcoin-related artworks look like shit. 
This one is brilliant.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:20:00
Of course they are. 
What can i do with it?
Make donations bigger, pay small amounts other way, use Bitcoin for other payments. 
My last buy was one year VPN service subscription. I've had other options to pay, but i used Bitcoin, it must flow.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:05:09
Difficulty will fall down and miners with less hashrate will take bigger part of the pie.
Some ppl already preparing to mine on their MacBooks lol.

I'm not 100% sure, not even 80%. Let's say...about 70.
Price still can fluctuate a lot, especially before and during weekend (seems it's common behavior) but i can't call this a crash. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:48:10
You are risky guy, Bitcoin is too far from $10k price. 
Anyway i wish you good luck, OP, even if you trolling us.
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:39:51
Really? So why are you sharing such a magic moneymaking machine?
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:33:06
About a year ago i have got my first Bitcoin.
There were so many stupid FUDs and every time a lot of scared fools believe and panic-sell!

@_date: 2017-05-10 16:17:34

Seems the whole site is full of shit too.
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:10:05
There are a lot of other scam/shit-coins around, Ripple is most successful of them. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:28:35

@_date: 2017-05-26 07:25:44
Why do you panic so much? 
There's still big margin between price you paid and today's price.
Sell amount that will cover your buying price and hodl the rest. 
If the market crashes, at least you will not lose your fiat shitmoney spent for buying.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:56:49

@_date: 2017-05-22 22:58:35
Best mobile: Breadwallet, Jaxx, BitPay.
Be careful of scam/fake wallets, there are many of them even in iOS AppStore.
Desktop wallets have very different features, it's hard to recommend, depends on your needs.
Electrum, Exodus, Multibit HD...
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:03:08
Litecoin does not suffer of extremely high demand, it's transactions pool never been overfilled.

Because of "Security card" and paper backup i had never really used my Ledger Nano.
Bought just being curious. As for me it's totally useless and worthless device. 
Breadwallet on my old iPhone 6 (most time offline or in airplane-mode,  sim-card removed too) seems way more secure, more reliable, and has incomparable better usability. I use it just as hardware wallet, so all i need to make transaction is turn it on and connect to wifi. 
I need no PC with a fucking Chrome. I don't like Google and most of their apps/services, i don't need to worry of "security card", and my paper backup is only contains seed words, instead of seed+QR-code for second "security card" recovery.
HW+PIN code+plastic security card+paper with seed+QR-Code to restore plastic Security card if it' lost....
 VS 
Old phone with cold storage chip + seed.
Hardware wallets are overcomplicated, a waste of money that will make you much more paranoid.

Unexpected power loss may be the "answer in question". Sometimes it leads to HDD physical damages like bad sectors. Especially on Windows.

Good question. Seems not. Btw what this means for you if they did?
Why can't some big hodler sell a part of his coins? There are a lot of cases when even rich people urgently need big amount of cash. 
Steve Jobs died of cancer, but how many expensive cures he had before illness killed him.

Show me something really useful made with Ehterium, please. Tell me, what can buy for Ether? The most simple is to buy Bitcoins! 
I'm sure that as soon as last pump of Ethereum is over, great part of its market cap would be transferred to Bitcoin.

Nobody knows. I think price going to fall before and skyrocket after.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:24:12
FUD is raising, nothing else really happed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:22:09
Yeah, my way to Bitcoin was through debris of dark market too.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:16:56
Ok. I'm often asking for the same, to quit FUD. 
You're right. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:47:19
I think they are tricking.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:40:05
OP, what did you want to tell with this post?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:49:34
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:28:16
I'm hodl!
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:59:11
What is the story about Bitpay and Jihcunt?
Did i miss something? Are they against SegWit?
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:38:46
Not because of tweet, it's a long story full of lie.
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:08:55
I don't think so. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Jihan's shitcoin is a shit. More likely people buy because Bitcoin price should skyrocket after August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:31:47
So, as you can see it's already close to 2700, soon you'll see profit.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:51:36
Looks just like some wallet log file btw. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:51:59
Don't even know who they are. 
Now not interested too, companies that  refuse future are condemned.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:12:02
Crash to $5k after august 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:33:57
I see. Let’s wait a bit more.
That’s nice that you hodl some ETH, it’s a smart decision.  Just catch right moment to sell, bro.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:37:55
Awwww yiiiiis!
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:51:12
Me too. Godspeed us! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:54:35
Mom! Let's sleep  together tonight, please! I'm scared of Jihan Wu!
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:22:35
Do not use Google sheet, except you're counting some shit.
Good try, Google, but we, wise people of Reddit, do not want to tell you how many Bitcoins we hodl! LOL
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:02:47
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:38:40
Is it a LOLFUD!?
1. How exactly do they do it?
2. What is the aim of this ridiculous act?
After they confiscate all Bitcoins in China i would recommend em to buy all other Bitcoins in the World no matter of how big the price is. I can sell em 1 btc for $1bil, i will not change my mind (at least for 30 days),  i promise.
After they bought all available Bitcoins their profit will reach singularity and total sum will be $0. Same success can be reached simple, just download some shitcoin sources, change name, and create your own currency, then mine zillion coins and enjoy how reach you are,
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:43:00
Congrats! You've bought more paranoia for money! That's what hardware wallets are made for LOL.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:13:03
I started to hate panickeers
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:33:04
Right NOW!
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:30:45
Ahahahaha i bought and still buy at different prices since November 2016, there was a times when my profits turn to loses and back.
Don't panic, nothing can grow non-stop.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:35:39
Let's see who's right. ETH is extremely pumped and overpriced. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:27:34
Waste of money. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:44:36
Your Bitcoins are ok, Multibit is a "thin client", so just press "Repair wallet" button in Settings.
This will rescan blockchain, and restore your transactions. Seems your wallet app was not ran for a long period. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:52:04
Wow, cool idea. But i better wait for someone’s screenshots rather than pay. Just not so curious, the idea is cool anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:10:22
Fuck it! Fuck Ethereum too!
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:32:25
Demand. And...it's underpriced, still very underpriced.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:50:42
None of these.
Both are best wallets to be fucked.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:49:27

Keywords are "last week".
Its growth is made of nothing.
And gonna end with big tears.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:33:24
Nice try. Obvious trolling.
Just imagine you have a decease like cancer.
Still won't sell? Ok. 
Go be fat somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:54:28
Oh! Another one shuts down servers for maintenance?
Coinbase, Kraken, GDAX and now Bittrex!
They're just going to make money of this.
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:07:33
It was a joke, of course. I'm just totally hate Google, almost everything they do looks ugly, interfaces sometimes are awful, they lie a lot, they collect data, reading your mail, mask their ads to fool you, give you free services that are not free in fact. You can spend hours trying to find any possible way to contact real man from support. Same shit with email or phone number, or an on-line chat.
The exception is if you violated their policy they will not keep you waiting with.
They newer write you messages like "Hey, just want to remind you're a nice guy, call me if you need something."
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:56:39
Never did, do not want to do it now, don't think would do it in nearest future. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:17:56
Ethereum is overcomplicated, already fucked up and hardforked then raised too much in no time. 
Smart-contracts? Show me anything really working and useful built with Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:55:52
And you're acting right. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:52:30
LOL true story! 
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:46:29
Wtf is this?
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:23:24
I see no even little chance for these motherfuckers. I hope community is bored of their FUD. Don't trust their shitty propaganda. Bitcoin was invented and raised without em, and will go further after they fail. No other scenarios possible.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:48:17
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:18:19
Block rewards were planned to be replaced with fees in future. It's Satoshi's vision, it's legit.
Bitcoin is not for buying a cup of coffee.
...but pizza.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:06:00
Sure, that is rational. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:59:43
Monero is the one with great specialization. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:13:46
Go be fat somewhere else, troll.
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:47:26
SegWit is not activated yet...ok, let's plane some next scaling solutions. More chaos! 
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:38:21
Why does he move backwards?
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:59:31
I trust math and science. I believe if AI exists it would not be evil. I still trust Bitcoin and think it will be the most reliable currency ever created. 
Ethereum has been already hardforked and hardfork did not kill it. 
All this shit is FUD aimed to fool Bitcoin investors, to force em to sell or to exchange BTC to SHT.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:59:17
Why don't they make their own shitcoin and leave Bitcoin?
Bitcoin will never belong to them.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:00:57
Stop this FUD!
SegWit is well-tested, strong and beautiful scaling solution. It will make Bitcoin better for everyone except psychopaths  like Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:30:27
Not a little.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:01:41
Not too long, technically Bitcoin itself is the same as it was, there are no real reasons to sell it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:38:49
Great! We need one global blockchain, aaaaand we have a leader. In my mind Bitcoin and Blockchain is a synonyms.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:22:14
That's why Ethereum crashed LOL
