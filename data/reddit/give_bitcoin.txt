Hell no. If you want peace of mind take your initial deposit out. With futures coming tomorrow and next week what if it goes to shit? That’s a real possibility. For your mental health it would be best to take break even and keep the rest in bitcoin. Whatever happens to the other half won’t matter because you didn’t pay for it in a sense because you recuperated your initial investment

Bitch google it the fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:12
When trading goes live for bcash that shit is going to fucking plummet 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:08
Holy fuck dude look at CNBC's twitter reply to that guy saying an intern is a bcash shill!!!! What the hell
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:02:48
Awesome advice congrats on your gains, it sure as hell paid off. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:33:05
Please take out your initial capital so you don’t lose any money. The rest is literally free money you can watch go up or down. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:46:50
My mom and my sister both are invested in bitcoin and I talk to them about it a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:02:28
Any gain is a taxable event you waffle
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:19
Probably but this is the most obvious pump and dump ever 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:33:38
Thank god I sold at 9.8k when it was going down. That HODL shit only works if you bought early as hell or if you have balls of fucking grade A steel 
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:32:24
Yep, it’s gonna hover between 10k and 13k imo these next few weeks then BAM BABY. I felt bad about buying $2.5k more last night at 10.9k but this shit’s for long run man 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:36:22
I just realized how bad we need twitch chat on gdax 
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:25:24
Oh... wow
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:41:50
New ath incoming in a couple of weeks. I feel it in my plums. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:53:24
Hey it’s going up aaaaand it’s gone. It’s going up again aaaaaand it’s gone. Etc. Etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:15:41
You’re the most pessimistic recurring poster in these threads. Your $200 work of btc isn’t gonna move shit 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:59:43
Hey look, a couple green dildos in succession 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:48:01
I like how bitcoin has no market hours. It’s night time in the western world, and the Asians pick up the torch. Come on my fellow Asian humans. Let the bull run wild! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:24:59
I opened it on my phone and it’s just a spam website right? Or is it a virus site
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:13:15
Dawg the g20 meetings haven’t even happened. This is clearly manipulation 
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:20:25
Just get your mom into crypto and save us the effort 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:21:54
I get paid tomorrow chill the fuck out coinbase 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:42:50
Hope your wife / gf doesn’t look at the price of bitcoin if you’re still HODLING lmao. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:31:16
Yep same. I made 3k from the late November pump until around December 13th and I took my profit. Thought I would just take my money and leave crypto forever but kept an eye on it for fun. Saw it dropped like a week after I sold and thought I was a genius for selling when I did. Last week I saw it was between 6k and 7k and was like fuck bitcoin really is dead. Smh, rebought at 9k and I’m strapped in for a new ath this time around! 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:54:34
The excitement is back yay 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:10:03
I HAVE FAITH 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:53:21
They can’t stop this train 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:35:47
I like you. Big baller 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:34:09
Bitcoin’s gonna crash to 6k LUL 
Edit: /s 
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:03:50
There it is, fear not. Be calm and hodl. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:21:43
If you bought from coinbase it tells you how much you bought it at. You should be using excel/blockfolio to keep track of this, it helps a lot.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:18:45
My only regret is that I didn’t buy when it dipped to 6k... Oh well, learning lesson 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:44:27
I was making a joke about all the people predicting 6k. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:29:26
I’m stocking up. If it hits 10k that’s the psychological barrier and it means we’re go for launch again. The market is cyclical so we’re going up to the high teens again eventually 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:32:10
Why are people like this 
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:13:11
What is this from? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:34:16
Boi. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:33:02
I’d take a gt3 over a lambo any day. Gt3 is more low key, for an exotic car that is. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:36:38
Lambo is more for showing off, a gt3 will drive a lambos tits off any day. Plus it’s cheaper to maintain and real car dudes will appreciate a gt3 over a lambo 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:33:24
Dropped 2.5k between last night and this morning. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:10:52
Bro that’s nuts I’m scared for tax season when I have to document each sell and each buy...
