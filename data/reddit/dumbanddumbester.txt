Most people support the real estate market, either as homeowners or renters, because they need a roof over their head. landlords are able to be in the business of real estate because there is a market price for providing a roof over your head. real estate has intrinsic value.
Gold has been used for thousands of years for fashion and ceremonial use throughout the world. Gold also has properties that are advantageous for use in industrial applications. Gold has intrinsic value.
Paper money and bitcoin have no intrinsic value. If people do not believe that they are stable forms of currency, then their value decreases. 
As far as bitcoin goes, it might work out in terms of use for transferring funds. But just like cash, what the hell good is it doing under the mattress? Supposedly it is a "rare" item, but again, who cares if it is rare if it is made up in thin air. 
At the end of the day, the fervor in this sub-reddit makes it clear as day that this is a speculative "currency" and that we are most likely dealing with tulip-mania.

ic, so I can "sell" and the money would be frozen at the current rate until dispersed. If it drops or rises during that week, I would get what I originally "sold" for.

Good question. It could be a single sale that made the Zillow chart drop. There is not a lot of action in this part of town.

As an investment for 1/5 of 6-digits it is.

You would need another 40 btc for repairs.

You're right, and it's done a lot of the time. Hence there are laws in place at the airport to report objects of value over $XX,XXX.

Yea, but if the storage of value is highly volatile, and not only up...then it doesn't behave well as a storage of value...

Taxes here were about $1000 a year, I expect them to drop with the new purchase price.

Dirty money is drug money. Money that has not been taxed that is owed to schools and roadwork, etc, can also be "dirty money".
