"TURN OFF THE FUCKING BRIGHTS"
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:37:58
Probably made in 2016 and hasn't been updated since

Even if the black market keeps it most people still wouldn't use it if it was banned in the way the previous commenter mentioned.

WinRAR supports having files in the archive automatically execute. I imagine other programs that support RAR would obey this procedure as well but I'm not sure. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:18:57
Alienware is overpriced, you can find better Gaming laptops without for way less (even with 10% off) 
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:25:02
You're doing it wrong, that's why! :p
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:24:09
If the archive was a rar there is a chance that once it was extracted th virus automatically ran. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:11:55
It doesn't fall under free speech. Putting somebody's logo next to some text and selling it is not protected. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 18:25:43
Judging by how the funds are being made available I'd say 4/14/14
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:26:08
That's not true, as I said with WinRAR you can have the rar extract and execute a file. I have used this before and it is not a self extracting exe. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:26:04
It is also possible to get archives to open files upon extraction automatically.

The .txt file was a text file, there was no extension spoofing. It was a hidden file so they were hoping that only one would display, the shortcut. Shortcuts always have hidden file extensions.

that's a lot of effort for what comes down to a silly joke 
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:49:26
I'm confused - is that a different picture than the one they replied to?
@_date: 2016-11-07 03:55:26
It's a retired joke by now, to the point it was even banned from where it was originally posted 
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:42:09
But how do you know what to look up to learn more?
@_date: 2019-10-02 11:38:21
At the risk of being negative, if it was a truly good add shouldn't it at least say Bitcoin or something? I don't know how many people recognize the logo
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:55:29
you make it sound like people can't just disable subreddit styles, and people on mobile aren't affected by css either
np is nice to stop mildly angry people but it won't protect you from brigades 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:07:40
Do you have a source? The internet one seems really low, I've heard it was around 40-60% that use adblockers 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:34:24
Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-09-27 13:33:20
That doesn't mean they won't talk about it. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 18:39:39
Yes, but again customers know of PayPal and it's customer oriented policies. The fact that PayPal has such a large market share makes them a choice because it means almost everyone knows of them. I haven't ever heard of stripe. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:06:58
and still a whole lot less money than some full price bundles 
@_date: 2016-09-03 17:05:02
It's also secure for the customer. With PayPal you know you're either getting your purchase or your money back. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 21:42:15
those are guidelines, not rules. I know many subreddits that don't follow the don'ts
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:36:39
because there's no fee for sending it
@_date: 2015-10-20 03:23:12


Postal workers have less incentive to steal than normal people. In the centralized system, the USPS has investigators and armed agents to retrieve stolen mail.

The bigger issue is that a lot of medical software will only run on XP. The sad thing is, this has been known for a year:
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:55:02
When used next to 5K, M is perfectly fine 
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:04:59
No, US hospitals do this too. Some medical software only runs on XP.
