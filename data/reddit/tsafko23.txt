I'm not doubting the financial complexity of the bitcoin mining industry. Exclusively from the energy side of the equation you're oversimplifying things considerably. It's quite simple to either sell excess generation into the real-time market or to schedule full day-ahead energy bids with the iso (for the full installed capacity) and then hedge operational demand in the forward market to claim RECs. Both are reasonable approaches we currently employ for generators (which also can self supply behind the fence). Of course there is no generic strategy for renewable resources. Everything is dependent on local regulatory conditions. The point of this post was to see if anyone is even aware of US-based btc mining operations which may or may not use installed renewable resources.

That makes sense, it just seems renewables would offer even cheaper energy; and more importantly, can provide additional revenue that not many are aware of which can significantly subsidize any installation costs. This is particularly true for larger operations.

If you install install rewable generation (i.e., solar or wind) on site you can qualify for RECs....
