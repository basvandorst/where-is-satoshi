Thanks mate you just explained everything I wanted to know. And yea the fact that their official website looks like a ducks crap is alarming.
Fun Fact: They require Passport details on registration. They also said that membership prices will double by July. SO hurry it's a limited time offer XD :D

Privileged to get substantial answers from a guy like you.

I agree completely with what you said. They should be called Banks instead of wallets.

I see and thank you for your reply. 
Than what would be the best factor to test which are most trusted?

Thanks for your comment these guidelines are for beginners only. I have rated them based on criterias gathered on official websites and information that they themselves have provided. I didn't check their blogs, because I believe all the best features should be highlighted on their websites front page.
I have never written that it's bank, kindly read it again. I believe Coinkite can help you to start your own bank if you want :)
