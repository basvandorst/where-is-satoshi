I read another article don't find the link now but it says: that no one on binance could buy or sell,
Binace is biggest exchange so what happen if nobody buy or sell? The market goes down or up very quickly.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:33:44
Bitcoin will continue the ride against all fear and critique.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:01:24
Back in business.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:43:44
The game is terrifying in the begging and is exciting when its end.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:57:04
The prospect and the future is after cryptocurrency take it easy and enjoy it
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:52:37
Otherwise use Mycelium to sell for cash to other people close to you, without any fees.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:18:56
She is very optimistic.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:27:23
Yep I'm in the game.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:29:27
The future is bright anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:00:14
I got it. How much is PLN to USD?
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:14:27
It's a good beginning, learn the market and behavior of the trend.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:44:39
Sorry mate, the right way is to keep calm and wait.  Or you can buy more today.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:27:33
Perhaps the beginners don't have patience and want fast profit?

Post on r/Bitcoin :
Anyone in city X want to exchange crypto to cash?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:29:04
This is a good deal for people, mobil and bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:50:01
When rich people wants to escape they will buy crypto in case when the govern banes their accounts as with many oligarchs happens right now. I would do the same if I was them. 
I call this security of founds.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:34:23
Terrifying in the begging and extacy when its end haha
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:36:58
Mycelium helps you with this. 
I use it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:57:30
2.01 BTC. Often I leave 50% and play with 1 btc when it is a dip.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:10:02
40 years experience of what? Trading crypto? Go away.

@_date: 2019-06-28 09:57:37
People see the small details but miss the obvious thing in the bigger picture.

@_date: 2019-06-28 01:07:25
The vegans are more open to the world. Nice bro :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:16:48
I quit Coinbase for some time ago. Just so bad service and they couldn't solve my issue with transaction from my bank.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:39:18
Cool insight, but hold now ok?
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:39:59
Yeah the price spiked to sky now at 13 374$
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:36:00
And Bitcoin will rise like a Phoenix no doubts
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:18:24
Sad story what happened with Binance that caused partly bitcoin to decrease.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:53:35
Hold Leo, Hold.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:25:49
Congrats. U reach ur goal :)

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:14:17
They had problems when the bitcoin dipped hard. Maybe again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:57:52
haha not so fast...maybe until the end of the year?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:01:41
r/Bitcoin\&gt; Your city&gt;Ask who want to exchange cash for crypto
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:58:49
Oh that's sad.
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:15:55


Is not allowed to post videos on binace sub.
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:28:32
Only one ID is true and the pic is too bad quality, you can't realy see what is written.
@_date: 2019-09-21 12:57:41
sad man :(
@_date: 2019-09-21 03:25:36
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:09:32
Could be the leaked photos and documents from Binance it self this year.
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:12:05
I had 2FA set up.
@_date: 2019-09-21 07:06:36
The intruder could use the photos and documents from binance it self to get acces to my gmail with help of a malmware? 
I couldn't notice anything because he deleted all the messages.
He didn't reset the password but he changed the withdrawal adress for what he needed to provide verification.
You are developer so tell me how he could do that?
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:40:51
You reflect as Binance without competence at all. With swedish ID in front of him he talks in Russian somewhere in Ukraine.
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:10:20
No is not my physical card, just a fake print copy paper on random card i suppose.
@_date: 2019-09-21 01:15:41
I had 2FA both on Google and Binance. Most likely that the new malware was deployed to get the wallet info and leaked photos and documents from Binance it self this year that makes it easier to hack.
@_date: 2019-09-21 06:13:02
I have no clue, I change my numbers quiet often don't see any conection with the phone number.
