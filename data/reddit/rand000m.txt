Counter argument: 99% of people are idiots and the person behind the Satoshi persona knows that being a mysterious, mythical figure will attract a much great greater following than revealing themselves as an ordinary person.
What better way to make sure Bitcoin gets attention than having a mystery at its very core?
I am far more interested in the technical details of digital currency but even I latched onto the news post suggesting "we've found him".  I guess everyone likes drama at some level :/

PDFs also contain bullshit scripting that can allow viruses to propagate.  The day they put scripting into PDF was the day I went "oh hell no, Adobe..  go die in a fire".  PDF would have been just fine as electronic paper but no.. they had to gay it up and make it vulnerable to exploits.

Are there any small-scale miners ~$100 that come close to breaking even (revenue vs power use)?  Or is it a lost cause unless you can run a massive farm with dirt cheap power?

More like “I authorise you to take $x from this account, and you’ll lose your ability to trade if you try and rob me”.
Credit cards are not an honesty system like you imply

Yay, selective enforcement!
It's unfeasible for the government to take *everybody* who donated to court.  But if you piss them off, it's a wonderful excuse to lock you up.  There's no such thing as "fair", they can choose to prosecute you and not prosecute the others.

if it's any consolation, the price will stop rising as soon as you buy more.
