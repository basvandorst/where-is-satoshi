My aunt was recently diagnosed with cancer. I had read “Tripping over Truth” on similar lines. I want to recommend it to her, but since i am not a doctor, i know my advice will be discarded.

I buy stuff from Amazon, but i dont see other way around. Most transactions are unidirectional for major part, still dont see how LN will work in realworld cases.

Some Alt coins are interesting, but cant discuss here.  Bitcoin police will ban me.

What limits do you see in your account?
I wish it was more like e*trade, where I can sell all at once or buy as much as I like, this limits makes me seriously rethink about my positions.
Edit: spell mistake corrected.

try getting ur public keys from wallet and check on blockchain.info for balance
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:16:14
Thanks! Gives me some hope :).
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:26:33
I could imagine using it as currency not as store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:53:03

Nice!! I payed over 300sats last week. I used a couple of mobile apps but no one provides option to set custom fees.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:50:08
BTC will be store of value, NOT transactional currency.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:14:50
No seriously, if I were to buy house in 3 yrs, instead of saving for my down payment in bank account, I would rather hodl in bitcoins till then. However, considering the selling limits, I wonder, I will not able to withdraw at right time.

Premined with no cap! "Dollar" altcoin is the biggest scam!
Esp when banks create credit out of thin air!
Unfortunately FED is caught in middle. Banksters are the real criminals here.

No way to create Credit/Money in bitcoin (if ppl hold private keys). Their free lunch is getting over!
Keeping bitcoins on exchanges and lending them will create another sort of banking, unfortunately

Buy what you need with cash? No credit system? May be the inflated house prices will come down so you can afford home without hefty loans! Or rents will be super cheap that no need to buy. What do I know, just speculation.

If they need money just ask for taxes.

People use fiat currency (day in day out) they dont need sub for that, however, when BTC gets mainstream, maybe we wont need sub ��

Move to ETH, after 1st Aug, move back to BTC
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:19:08
Fiat currency is fine for trade, however as store of value, i would would prefer scarce resource like bitcoin.
