I fucking hate PayPal. Been waiting two fucking days to withdraw £500 into my bank account while they randomly decided to put it into "pending". I don't know where the fuck they get their exchange rates from USD to GBP from either. I hope Bitcoin puts them out of business fast.

It just won't finish syncing. The bar doesn't load any further, even if left for hours.

I've found it but how do I export it?
@_date: 2016-10-08 20:22:43
How do I export the debug file? Send the system log? Sorry I'm not great with this.

Laptop died but I'll do it tomorrow. Thanks man.

Really? How did that work?

Sure, in an ideal world. But imagine you have a very low paying job, poor prospects, but a ton of BTC sat in your wallet that you bought at $0.3 or something. Until you can buy houses, petrol, food etc with BTC in a non-niche capacity, I'd imagine you'd be trying to cash in asap. Althought personally I'd hold on to half of whatever BTC I had as I believe, in the long run, it will prevail.

Haha good point. Deserved it.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:17:32
Not a bad idea. I guess there's the potential to make a killing whilst also investing in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:20:42
I guess. It's just if I had potentially millions sitting there I'd cash in and go travelling around the world. I mean just having the ability to not have to be anywhere for anything if I didn't want would have me running to the exchanges. I guess I'm greedy.

Anyone holding millions in Bitcoin and not selling at least enough to live comfortably without having to work a day job, is IMO misguided.

Wow, that's a potential earning of 100k+ a week. Now I get it lol.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:41:11
I'm a realist, and I know that Bitcoin can't buy the same things as fiat money can, so yes, I'd sell enough Bitcoins to live happily off of fiat. I'd rather use Bitcoin, and I'd keep a large stake of my BTC still, but ultimately  I'd sell enough Bitcoin to live nicely. Nobody "needs" to travel the world.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:49:20
I wish. I just don't understand how it all works. I've bought and sold BTC before, but I can't imagine how such a big deal would go down is all.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:45:57
I was just curious is all. Cheers.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:41:31
Thanks man, this answered my question quite clearly.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:31:02
That's what I'm saying. How the hell did the many BTC millionaires exchange there Bitcoins for fiat? Surely they don't just put the whole lot on Bitstamp and wait for it to sell?
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:54:33
With you there bro.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:18:47
Same! I really hope BTC kills off PayPal soon too.
