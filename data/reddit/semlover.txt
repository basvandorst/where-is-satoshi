If you could invest in a 10% 0 variance annual return product while borrowing money at 5%, that is free money.
If you could invest in a 10% high variance annual return product while borrowing money at 5%, you would be essentially flipping a coin if you go bankrupt or make a bit extra money. 
When investors take risk, they want to compensated for that risk. Taking on risk without a payoff is not investing - it's gambling. Mining in a smaller pool is like accepting money market returns but with stock market risk!
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:08:25
Yes, and in the end we have to make a judgement call as to if our simplified version is close enough to make useful predictions. Mining has a large sunk cost, the expected marginal cost when ordering the machinery has to be low for you to recoup costs. I have not heard of any major miners turning off their machines when hash rate creeps up. I would expect just from this factor major discrepancies between marginal cost of mining and the value of bitcoins.

This is simply a flawed outlook. Holding bitcoins is very risky (volatile). Speculators try to bet on volatile prices in order to make a profitable trade. Merchants are in the business of selling items, not speculating. If a business is involved in speculation, I think it would poorly reflect on their ability to make profits from their actual business. If you owned shares in McDonalds and you found put they put 10% of their assets in Chinese Sculptures to try to flip them, you should be outraged since they have no business in that arena. If you want to think of bitcoins as a good medium for currency, it's no different than paying an american in Euros, they will convert all them they don't need on hand.

Those are somewhat arbitrary distinctions that are not purely necessary, since bitcoins are unique and cannot be duplicated I think it's fair to declare them an asset. If the asset can be used as a medium of exchange, I would expect that to raise the price. If it's a good store of value, widely trusted, pretty to look at, etc, all these things tie in to the valuation. There is no conflict. 
Some stocks can be classified as 'tech' or 'healthcare', again these aren't true distinctions, just used to help people understand how to value them quickly. Bitcoin is the same, calling an investment or currency doesn't change anything.

It takes a very smart person to admit that. He's not saying he can't value it in the sense that if he was employed as an analyst he wouldn't have an answer. It comes more to the basis that he KNOWS some more conventional businesses were undervalued and low-risk. He could see Google and Apple had huge potential but couldn't estimate the likelihood that they would suffer greatly too.
Warren Buffett is quite prescient, there is a reason investors take his word so seriously, be very wary betting against him.

How about .05 BTC fair money bet, settling the day following the the results are available, averaged over all auctions. I'll say the average of all the coins will be lower than the spot price at the time of the auction. If there's a dispute we ask r/Bitcoin to settle it. If there's no way to reliably find the $ they were bought or if they were not all bought no money changes hands?
I wouldn't renege on a $25 bet btw

If bitcoin were a stock, then yes, because the profits of the company are now being split among fewer participants. Since the valuation of bitcoin is purely speculative at this point it could go up or down based on how likely you think this will be the one major crypto in the future and some expectation on the velocity of bitcoins.

Short answer: yes
long answer: no.
Anytime someone places a market sell order, there will be downward pressure. If the market is at all normal, these 'normal' transactions are just adding liquidity to the market, not moving the price. There is a possibility of a black-friday type even maybe, say overstock puts all items 90% for one hour for bitcoin purchases (which they immediately convert to fiat), lots of people use bitcoins to buy stuff but don't replace their coins right away. To the market it would look like a massive sell off.

For an extra conspiracy theory - what if someone bought the requisite # of mining units, did a 51% attack, then in the rush that followed for the community to buy more miners, sold their mining units for profit. If I were an evil genius I would do this. 
But seriously the market cap of all bitcoins should be somehow bounded to the $ value of the current hashrate, if it only takes $100M to bring down a $6B system, there's likely a problem.

So keep in mind there are 2 definitions of inflation, Krugman is talking about purchasing power, wheres most Libertarians talk about currency inflation. Also Krugman is speaking about, if we want x, will currency y provide what we are looking for? In this case, the unstated assumptions are that full employment with a stable and growing economy is the desired outcome (x), and 2% inflationary (purchasing power) currency is probably the best to achieve these ends (y). There has been a lot of work by very smart people in this arena, if you want a real answer you should probably post in a different subreddit.
Considering Krugman is a nobel prize-winning Ph.D. economist and we aren't, even if you disagree with his philosophy and politics, we could probably still learn a thing or two from him.

I would define the difference between a speculator and investor similar to the difference between value and momentum investing:
A speculator beliefs they can profit from a price change of an investment not because of its intrinsic properties, but based on the hope of future price movements.
An investor believes they can profit from the total return of an investment because the investment offers a good long term return with an acceptable level of risk. 
A speculator and investor may buy the same asset and buy the same amount relative to income. The investor will be the one doing research, the speculator will be the one trying to time the market and flip some coins. These definitions are very subjective. I would classify most bitcoin adopters as speculators, there is not a very clear way to value bitcoin yet  (independent of it's recent trading prices). To a speculator it doesn't really make a difference if btc is at $600 or $1200 because the price is just a temporary stop on its way to $100k, but to an investor it has to be $600/(my estimated long term expected value discounted by the time value of money and volatility concerns) so the numerator makes a pretty big difference. 
Just my 2 cents. (I come from investing background and own 0 bitcoins)
