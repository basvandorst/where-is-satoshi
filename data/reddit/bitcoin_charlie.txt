There are 1 step installs on the internet, but they are not universal. The issue is running a full node differs based on operating system, settings, ect. I'ts really not a difficult process. Its just like setting up any ol webserver and having data feed to a public facing site. Overall I agree, would love to see core devs roll out a simpler install.

How exactly does the 3% and points work? If I buy a $100 Amazon/Walmart gift card on iOS, how do the discounts apply? Im trying to understand the difference between you guys and Gyft. I use Gyft alot but since you have an iOS app, I'd like to try it out. They don't offer a discount but I get $1=1 point and 1 point takes $1 off a purchase, so its 3% cash back

This could be a good idea, maybe something like: 
Address is used, hacker steals my keys, if there was someway I can notify the address or someone using the address. For example, sending a specific amount of BTC, like 0.00023831 (which only I know). BitID would check the transactions of that address if it received that amount, and it would block it from being used. 
If the address gets compromised, if it receives any amount from a preset 'disabling' address (that only I know) BitID would check before approving a signin.

The delay comes because Payza offers so many deposit methods, some of them have chargeback and fraud risk. We need to make sure the funds are not coming from hacked accounts, fraud ect. 
However, the price is locked in at the time you create a withdrawal, so you are guaranteed the rate.

Like Coinbase, there is risk of ACH and bank fraud. Payza accepts local bank transfers from over 190 countries. When you fund your account in USD, EUR, GBP, ect. you can buy Bitcoin and lock in a rate immediately. The risk and fraud department then processes the withdrawal, usually taking a few hours to 1 day. However on weekends, withdrawals won't get processed until the next business day so it says 1-3 days to be on the safe side.

$12.99 is not expensive, considering they self funded the whole project. They took some donations, but over 80% was self funded. 
This documentary filmed while some of the craziest stuff was happening from 2011-2014. If you want to put a visual on what was going on in the early days, the doc is fantastic.

I imagine this is how it went down......
It was cold winter morning, January 3rd, 2009. Nakamoto poured his steaming cup of coffee, barely able to keep his eyes open. After many weeks of sleepless nights working on the code for Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto was excited to have finally finished his life work. Nakamoto was confident the Blockchain would solve the worlds problems, and confirm his legacy in the history books of time. 
Three months earlier, on November 1st, Nakamoto proposed his idea to a small, but renowned, group of mathematicians, cryptographers, and statisticians. 
*I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party. The paper is available at:  He said
The community looked for every possible reason that Nakamotos idea would not work. They claimed it would not scale, and told Satoshi he did not have the resources to make it happen. 
Alas Nakamoto passionately responded back, and slowly but surely convinced them Bitcoin could work. Skeptically, they listened.  
Now, three months later, after working out every kink and every glitch, Satoshi was ready. He had completed Bitcoin version 0.1. 
He looked down at his laptop and realized, that as soon as he executes the command, to start the Blockchain, he would be removing power and policy out of the hands of corrupt governments and back in the hands of the people. 
Nakamoto decided that he wanted to embed something into the Blockchain. To send a message, but also prove that from this day forward the Blockchain will live. 
Glancing at his newspaper Nakamoto read:


*Nope, nothing will solve that problem* he joked to himself. 
He continued reading


*Ah, the world financial crisis. I think we can fix this* 
Nakamoto turned back to his laptop, took another sip of his coffee and typed:
    The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
*Now, it's ready.* 
    ENTER
...Thus, the Genesis Block was created and Bitcoin was born
Nakamoto sat back in his chair, took another sip of his now cold coffee, and started sweating. 
History is defined by moments. That was one of them.

**Vonnegut: Bitcoin's Place in Wealth Management**
By NORB VONNEGUT
June 12, 2014 9:42 a.m. ET
Every financial adviser knows this story in one form or another. It is Friday afternoon, 10 minutes to the market close. Your biggest client calls with a problem.
Also in Wealth Adviser:
Investors Aren't Cheering for Brazil
For Brokers, Taking on Employers Gets Tough
Visit the Wealth Adviser Page
"My daughter lost her wallet. She's traveling in India. She has no cash, no credit card, no bank account, no place to stay, nothing to eat. She's not close to an office that issues travelers checks. How soon can we wire money?"
You can't remember the last time your team handled an international wire. Maybe it was never. You know these transfers often take days.
What to do?
I have fielded my share of similar requests. Which is part of the reason I recently developed an interest in bitcoin. It is both a currency and a payment system. The currency can be sent anywhere in the world in 10 minutes. No fees, and the mechanics are really simple.
In fact the more I learn, the more I wonder how long it will be before bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work their way into the business of wealth management.
Yeah, yeah. I have read about the spectacular hacks, the collapse of organizations such as Mt. Gox. I understand bitcoin is highly volatile. And I am not sure how many companies--other than Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic--accept it as payment.
So I did a little digging.
After speaking with a friend I surfed to localbitcoins.com, where the home page says you can trade bitcoin in 5,934 cities in 231 countries. I found people willing to meet in person and exchange Indian rupees for bitcoin. Locations included New Delhi and Dehradun. To my surprise, there were no meet-ups available in Mumbai.
But when I changed the payment method--I agreed to accept rupee deposits into local Indian banks--the number of cities and range of choices expanded exponentially.
Problem solved. Indian banks are open on Saturdays. Score one for bitcoin.
I then turned to the other potential uses, like asset protection. Wealthy clients are targets for opportunistic litigation. Why not try bitcoin as a low-cost form of asset protection? The currency has no central authority. And it is held in electronic wallets which, unlike bank accounts, can't be frozen.
I asked Ike Devji what he thinks. Mr. Devji, an attorney based in Arizona, focuses exclusively on asset protection law for a national client base.
"Any strategy that relies on secrecy is a failure," says Mr. Devji. "Bitcoin is a 'discoverable' asset and subject to attachment if held in client name, just like anything else."
Mr. Devji advises his clients to use proven legal vehicles, such as offshore trusts in some cases, to put assets beyond the reach of predators and creditors. "Hiding something, hoping no one will ask and being willing to commit perjury if they do is not really a plan at all."
Okay, I get that. Money transfers, yes. Asset protection, no. How about bitcoin as an investment?
Total disclosure: I own a tiny position in bitcoin and am comfortable with the price volatility and the risk that other cryptocurrencies might displace it.
I am bullish because there are no merchant-processing fees. I think bitcoin will disrupt the credit-card industry and trade higher over time as more and more companies agree to accept it as payment.
Unfortunately for advisers, the publicly traded bitcoin ETFs aren't available yet. To own the currency, it is necessary to set up an electronic wallet. Or maybe you can find a private, firm-sanctioned fund.
If I were still in the business and a client asked me for investment advice about bitcoin, I'd probably retreat to the old standby: "I'm not sure how cryptocurrencies fit into a successful asset allocation strategy." Which is true, and it would no doubt keep me out of hot water with compliance.
That said, I would be watching bitcoin like a hawk, waiting for the arrival of the public ETFs and keep thinking about ways that free, immediate money transfers can change the service end of wealth management.
About that fictional Friday afternoon scenario: One of my children is actually traveling in India these days. Thinking "what if," which is the essence of wealth management, **I recently set up bitcoin wallets for everyone in my family.**
Just in case.

@_date: 2014-08-02 22:45:05
This is a really good article, and a fun topic to talk about. The tl;dr of it is that as long as you own some Bitcoin, you are owning a share or stock in the success of Bitcoins future. It's a kind of combined way of everybody in the industry having a common goal and mutual economic incentive for Bitcoin to succeed, no matter which companies are responsible for its success. I remember recently someone asking me "how can the average Bitcoin holder do more for Bitcoin" and I gave a simple answer. Everytime you go out to eat, shop, or spend any money, simply ask "Hey, have you thought about accepting Bitcoin" in a completely non aggressive or confrontational way. You will see that more than 50% of people will have heard of Bitcoin, especially in Western, for lack of a better term (I hate this word) countries. Even if 1 in 10 show interested and 1 in 20 actually go through with it, its a huge win for Bitcoin and expanding its impact on the world.

@_date: 2014-02-26 22:01:17
In this article Adam Levin, Napoleon, and myself come up with our conclusions and how the MtGox coins were probably never lost at all....
**TL;DR The basis of this article is this:**


Transaction malleability hacks have been taking place for some period of time, and MtGox was alerted to them. The cold wallet was mostly depleted in this process and for the first time in a long time, perhaps for the first time ever, the coldest-cold wallet was tapped to refill the cold wallet. It was then discovered that the coldest-cold wallet private keys were not functional or were missing.
There are any number of different reasons why the coldest-cold wallet’s keys are wrong/missing/corrupted. Perhaps there is a problem with the elliptic curve in the PHP custom wallet software. Perhaps a drive failed, perhaps a USB key was wiped, or just plain lost. Any number of reasons.
If it is a software problem with a custom wallet, then perhaps Mark believes he might be able to correct it and generate the correct private keys. If it is a data-loss problem then perhaps he thinks it is recoverable in some way.
This completely coincides with what Mark said: 


@_date: 2014-05-24 16:49:37
Yes, however BitWallet will be removed sooner rather than later. It will happen like every other Bitcoin wallet has been removed. When that happens, you won't be able to get support/bux fixes anymore. 
The good thing about Pheeva is they are operating under Apple's TOS with an enterprise license. Signing up is fairly easy. Yes, you do have copies of your private keys. Just log into Pheeva's website for an encrypted copy. They cant do anything about it since they dont have your password so they cant steal your keys. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:35:11
Yes, we know its a social engineering attack. Let me explain: 
Sam got an email with a phishing page that looked liked Google where he needed to enter his username and password to proceed. 
2 things can now happen
A- 2FA is disabled and with the user/pass the attacker can now use his OWN Chrome browser to login to Sams account and sync all of his passwords to his - this is what happened. 
B- 2FA is enabled and when the attacker gets the user/pass and tries to login using his OWN Chrome browser to sync the passwords, he is given a 2FA verification page to enter a code which he does not have. Therefore not allowing him to sync the passwords. 
Make sense? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:08:15
Dude, your article is amazing. Inspiring. Thanks for writing it. I wish I could have referenced more of your points, but I ran out of time!

Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:45:08
Thanks! No I don't support human trafficking, rape, or pedophilia. My alleged crimes was that I allegedly knew a BitInstant customer was reselling BTC he bought from us to people who allegedly would use those coins to buy products on Silk Road, some of which are illegal in the USA. [source](
I resigned because I had to think about Bitcoin, the foundation, and its future. I decided that regardless of the merits of my case, anyone representing Bitcoin, including foundation execs, should have a standard of excellence and transcend any scandal. I resigned within 2 hours of returning home from prison. 
Once this is over and behind me, I hope to return to spreading the Bitcoin message to the world. 
To the moon!!

My basic review:
It was so good! I would say 20% were Bitcoiners, but the place was a full house. Some celebs were there, and there was a huge line outside as well as a red carpet to get in. Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain, TradeHill, Coinapult, ect. came and it was really awesome to see old friends again.
The movie itself was perfect. 90 minutes, but it felt like 10. The movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time, and Im not just saying it because I was in it. Even the security guard told me it was fascinating! Such a wide array of characters and views, the movie really makes you come to your own realization that Bitcoin is the future. They even filmed a SR drug dealer who said now all of his deals happen on SR and not on the streets with guns. Was such an amazing film, I cant wait for you guys to see it!
I spoke to the producers. Tomorrow they are having a big distributors meeting. This community funded a big part of the project, and will be rewarded.

No accounts on Coinbase (feel free to verify as well). I own less than 100 BTC and I'm holding, it's my nest egg. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:17:21
I'm in the same boat as you. All we can have is hope. MtGox still does have ~8.2% of customer deposits in USD assets, I hear of debt--&gt;equity ideas but honestly don't know.

I am NOT a fan of paper wallets. I've seen stories over again of them being ripped up, burnt, washed away, ect. Paper does not last long.

Second, you have never been under house arrest and you have no idea of the emotional and psychological toll it has in you. I've asked you to provide proof you were and you ignored me. 
I'm not complaining at all, I'm just proving you wrong. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 16:41:35
OP stop ignoring my top comment. BitInstant shut down over a year after the alleged crimes and had nothing to do with it. We shut down because regulations got to grey for us to keep operating. Read my post above and stop ignoring me.

Because unlike bank bail outs where the FDIC prints more money (making ours worth less) to pay for everyone who lost, there is no MtGox insurance. We're talking about peoples school tuition, food for families, livelihoods, ect. 
EDIT: My apologies, my words meant to convey that my solidarity goes out to people who lost money in this situation. I understand the FDIC does not print money. I'd change my text, but don't want to ruin the integrity of my text. Cheers.

**The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin**
Directed by Nicholas Mross. (USA) – World Premiere. What is Bitcoin? The digital currency, created by anonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, is heralded by some as the future of the global economy, even as it is increasingly stigmatized by volatility and implicated in online drug trafficking and money laundering.  Nicholas Mross’ illuminating documentary digs deep into the origins and meteoric rise of Bitcoin through the stories of those intrepid innovators at the forefront of this developing technology.
**After the Movie:** Stay for a conversation with director Nicholas Mross, the film’s protagonist Dan Mross, and Charles Shrem for the most up to the minute details about the mysterious and rapidly changing world of Bitcoin.

Hey, 
Find a Western Union / Moneygram location near you. Let me know which one. Send me BTC and Ill send an instant payment to you. You can pick up the cash. Since its a domestic transfer, the fee's shouldnt be that bad. 
Let me know, would love to help

We really need more transparency here and MtGox to open their books. However given the US and Japanese authorities are already investigating this is unlikely, in fact, they will probably be even more closed about information now. Sucks.

Premier is next Wens at Tribeca Film Festival, April 23rd at 530pm. 
Since this was self funded, and by donations from the Bitcoin community, Im sure they will release it to everyone very soon after.

No, I think they worked for the festival. One of them actually told me he was fascinated by Bitcoin, he said he lived near me in Brooklyn and that he will love to do private security for me and get paid in Bitcoin. I may take him up on his offer.

Mark stepping down from the foundation and outside advisors working within MtGox had led me to believe there are/were buyers looking to take over. I understood it as a management takeover which would be embraced by the community. I had no idea it was a bail out. This is shocking. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:01:44
If this whole thing is true, I stand corrected and have been lied to all along. We've all been lied too all along. I'm really sorry if I brought  too much hope, I was just giving them benefit of the doubt. My coins in Gox are lost too. Long live Bitcoin!

Hey Bracek, 
I havent been online in a few days, nor received any emails from you. 
Please email me your Bitcoin address and I will take care of this. Ive never scammed anyone and dont intend to now. 
You have my phone number, email, address and everything. I wish you would contact me that way instead of making "charlie shrem is a scammer thread"
For the record, you mailed me 200 BTC + worth of physical Bitcoins which I sold on your behalf. I've paid you over 150 BTC so far and told you I'd pay you when I sell the coins. I still have not sold all the coins and have been paying you anyways (I still have a few left). I am happy to pay you the rest if you contact me. 
I PM'd you my email address again.

I actually never made that comment.
 If you notice all the comments I made at the event last night are in quotes, except for that one. I would never comment on my case, especially to the press, publicly. This is the press looking for headlines and making things up. Read the story. 
It's good to know your are already judging me guilty based on a 1 sided criminal complaint from the government. 
The truth will come out in time. Those who know me, know this to be true.

Looks like she's scared and left the set, she's in the hallway and does not want to talk to me! 
EDIT: 
EDIT 2: this is how it went down:
Leah called into Bloomberg and she should have done the whole show. The host Trish who knows me pretty well decided to have me call in last minute to debunk her claims.
During the commercial break, someone told Leah that I'm calling in, and she left. She literally was in the hallway during my whole interview. The producers were trying to have her come back during my interview, but she say no way. 
Needless to say, I think it went well anyway. They played her clips back and allowed me to debunk them. 
Hope you all enjoy it. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 23:45:42
I can't comment at the moment (Im sure you can understand) I will be officially entering my plea this Thursday (sep 4) at the federal courthouse in NYC. Its open to the public if you want hear more or speak to me then. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:09:36
Hey, 
Thanks for the words and I agree with you. Other people have written the same you below and I took it. 
This was a last minute interview and did not have much time to prepare, I had thought I'd be talking to Leah directly.  
If you have the time, besides for the 'barely speaks english' which may have been exaggerated, I'd love to hear more about how I could have improved. Also, while I'm not the calmest person, I try to take criticism and make myself better. 
Thanks 
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:36:03
Honestly, me too. That would suck. Its hard because day traders look for small coins to take over so they can pump and dump, usually its not the original creator/devs intentions.

Running a Bitcoin node gives you a the warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from helping people download the blockchain faster. Same as seeding torrents provides warm fuzzies. You are supporting the overall Bitcoin network, relaying transactions and allowing people close to your server location to download the blockchain faster.

The hotel caters to European tourists and one of the things they are excited about is the fee savings. Accepting a European credit card comes with almost double the fees as US credit cards and much more chargeback risk.

Thanks man, its good to see intelligent people on this thread! 
As Weev had said: 
A lot of people think I was indicted because I am an asshole. That is not true. Aaron Swartz was not an asshole. Matthew Keys is well loved by everyone as well. Deric Lostutter literally exposed rapists to public scrutiny, and he is still catching a case for it. The underlying issue is that there are real criminals that loot billions from our economy through computer crime. The FBI has neither the competence to identify them nor the ability to extradite them from Russia where they are operating. They receive a metric fuckton of money to solve this problem and have to act like they are doing something about it. They will not indict you because you are a bad operator. They will indict you because you are there. I overturned my verdict only because I am an asshole. You can’t avoid being indicted here, but you can fight endlessly against the seditious morons that do it. Don’t cop a plea. Go to trial. Fight until you have nothing left.

You don't understand. The attacker got into his Chrome password list because he did not have 2FA enabled. If he did, the attacker would have been stopped dead in his tracks at the Google login page, thus stopping the attack. 
No, 2FA is not the solution to all problems, however if you have 2FA on your email and Bitcoin accounts, it will stop most attacks.

My 'good news on the horizon' was this. From what you read above, I didn't know forsure all this information, however Mark voluntarily stepping down from the foundation showed a positive light in my book. It showed that he was willing to let better management takeover. In hindsight, I let myself be naive. I should have known better, I'm sorry.

is a circlejerk of Bitcoin trolls. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:48:23
It was so good! I would say 20% were Bitcoiners, but the place was a full house. Some celebs were there, and there was a huge line outside as well as a red carpet to get in. Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain, TradeHill, Coinapult, ect. came and it was really awesome to see old friends again. 
The movie itself was perfect. 90 minutes, but it felt like 10. The movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time, and Im not just saying it because I was in it. Even the security guard told me it was fascinating! Such a wide array of characters and views, the movie really makes you come to your own realization that Bitcoin is the future. They even filmed a SR drug dealer who said now all of his deals happen on SR and not on the streets with guns. Was such an amazing film, I cant wait for you guys to see it!

Im trying to get an answer to this. Bear with me. 


You will not need a CC to reserve a room. We have a dedicated Bitcoin reservation page. This was a big question as well. 


All of the above yes, mostly its about training. Will it be difficult to train the staff, how easily can it be rolled out to thousands of locations.

Hey Sam, 
I'm in the same boat as you my friend. 
It happened to my company BitInstant. All of our accounts with 2FA were secured, we only had one that was not. The hacker was able to get into it and withdraw about $12,000, 333 BTC at the time, thats $213,000 in USD today. You can read more here: 
It happens, the only thing you can do is learn from it
Good luck

I wrote this after seeing Scotts  
Doing that requires you to buy one of his servers, and sometimes doing it yourself is fun :) 
Running a Bitcoin node gives you a the warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from helping people download the blockchain faster. Same as seeding torrents provides warm fuzzies. You are supporting the overall Bitcoin network, relaying transactions and allowing people close to your server location to download the blockchain faster. This is a good way to learn some basic linux because the install is fairly straightforward and I address most of the problems you could encounter. 
At the end of the guide, you will have something like this:

What the hell? How do you give 'HitBTC' such a high rating in safety? 
“HITBTC” was founded by “Ullus Corporation”. The company was incorporated in 2013 and claims to be licensed as a financial company. Operating accounts were opened in “SWED Bank” and “SEB Bank”. Swedbank AB is a Nordic-Baltic banking group offering retail banking, asset management, financial, and other services with Stockholm. The latter Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB is also a Nordic bank Its activities comprise mainly banking services, but SEB also carries out significant life insurance operations and also owns Eurocard.
Ullus Corporation's website is down (ulluscorp.com), but looking at a cached version of the site it says "The company’s headquarters, since its inception, are located in Hong-Kong" and also repeatedly talk about their Financial License, but don't say from which country. (
This is where it get's interesting, the company also registered CatPay.com which is some sort of a Bitcoin wallet. Both domains are now under private registration and try to not be connected to each other. CatPay's customer service line is in Estonia.
Both of those domains are owned by ulluscorp.com which has been taken down. You can easily get RAW versions of the old Whois file on the registration
ulluscorp.com ( Registrant Name: Ricardo Singh Registrant Organization: ULLUS CORPORATION Registrant Street: Ricardo J. Alfaro Avenue, The Century Tower Bldg.

That Panama City name and address is bullshit. 
From my research they are NOT in Hong Kong or Panama, rather in Estonia and many attempts at asking them who they are have resulted in banning and ignoring. STAY AWAY.

*Companies need to take regulation seriously, because there are companies that are still acting... you think that because I got arrested you're going free and clear, they are investigating everyone, everyone is on their radar.

Thats because you were syncing and downloading the whole blockchain from peers via Bitcoind. This also used all my memory. However, if you simply torrent the blockchain on your server. You have have the whole blockchain synced within 2 hours and run Bitcoind. 
Proof- I am currently running a node on a 1GB server, actively maintaining ~60 connections, never crashed.

@_date: 2014-09-19 17:42:07


I don't disagree with you. 
My point is that buying and selling is alot more decentralized than it was on the last bubble, trading is done less on exchanges and more on OTC, retailers (Coinbase, LocalBitcoins), ATM's, ect. 
For some reason, we all follow exchange pricing because its a true supply and demand market, however I'd like to see a bigger detachment from it. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:31:31
It happens to everyone, I just happen to be held in a high regard so it gets more attention. I've never scammed anyone. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:32:02
I see your point when using something like a Coinbase wallet, because it comes from different addresses, ect. Blockchain wallet would work great with this, but you are right, you'd have to move funds around. Unless you create an address solely for the signin and use your regular address for the payment. 
This is amazing technology. It's also trustless, because Signin with Facebook, ect. you have the risk of facebook leaking or password cracking. 
My question to OP is- If my keys are compromised, how can I be assured the hacker can't continue using it? 
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:37:03
I wish I knew!! I want to see it again :) 
The producers and director are actively on this subreddit so I'm sure they will see this and hopefully respond. I don't know what else to say, its an awesome film and you will all see it soon!

Hey Guys, happy to be working with Payza on this. 
We blend our exchange rate from the market and our liquidity partners. You can hold a fiat balance in your account at any time in USD, EUR, GBP and 20 other currencies. At any time you can buy Bitcoin and the price will be locked in immediately with withdrawals taking 24-72 hours. 
You can fund your account via local bank transfers in 190 countries, sometimes deposits only taking a few hours. We also accept wire transfers and other country-specific deposit systems, like INTERAC in Canada and SEPA in Europe. 
We will be slowly adding more features and already have a phases rollout plan. 
If you have any suggestions, feedback or collaboration, please PM or email me on my website [charlieshrem.com](

Hey, I am not sure about the plugin, I know they have compatibility with many forum software. Will edit this post when I find out. Payza is a great alternative to Paypal. 


Payza offers a local bank transfer withdrawal for New Zealand. They also offer the ability to add funds to your credit or debit card. See 


Funds can originate from any of the deposit methods and can be withdrawn to Bitcoin. Therefore you can fund your account from bank wire, bank transfer, credit card, account transfer, ect and withdraw to Bitcoin.

Interesting article. The best way to save fiat, according to the article, is using a secured credit card, some pay 6% a year interest on a balance up to 5k USD. 
Just as a note, Bitcoin yearly gains: 
2009  4,867% (uncertain price discovery period)

2011  1,320%

Here is a great python script you can run on the server to via the node publicly. 
This is what it looks like on my node: 
You have to run the script every time to update, but you can easily turn the script into a cron job to run every 10 minutes or so. 
You may get an error about not having "bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy" if you do, download and run Jeff Garziks BitcoinRPC script.  will solve the problem nicely.

It was right on the front page and in our FAQ. You can see our website in the archive.org wayback machine if you want. 


Why didn't you just do $3,000 in one shot? Because you knew that was above our limits so you went out of your way to do 6 separate orders of $500 to go around our limits. Your words, not mine.

Title is VERY misleading. I wasn't banned from this or any conference. There's a story behind what happened but legal has advised not to comment on the specifics. 
I'm kind of disappointed CCN didn't reach out to me, or my lawyers, to confirm/deny the story. I thought they were moving away from speculative tabloid into being a real news source.
Source: I am Charlie Shrem :)
**Edit**: Can the media use some different pictures of me? I mean, that one looks good but a simple google image search gives you so many better ones ! 
**Edit 2**: 
**Edit 3**:  now CCN posts:
"Editor’s Note: Charlie Shrem has responded publicly by saying thathe has not been banned from any conference. Verbiage which CCN profusely apologizes for initially printing. However, Shrem has since been utterly unresponsive in presenting his side of the story"
What's the deal with those guys ? I even tweeted at them that I reached out to them twice and they didn't respond to me.
I've yet to receive any email from them , or a response on twitter. My email address and PGP key are public on charlieshrem.com
**Edit 4** - Finally spoke to CCN :) We worked it out and I look forward to getting them a statement.

I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2010, when maybe 20 people in the world had heard about Bitcoin. Many of us know Mark personally, have spent time with him and Tokyo, and given the scams we've seen over the years, MtGox does not fit the bill. I don't know 100% but my instinct tells me not to worry. Trust me, I have many things to worry about at the moment.

You didn't answer his question. How was my fund a fraud ? The premise was to have a token backed by real companies. Regardless it's a moot point, we shut it down and refunded. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:34:40
Have you watched the video ? I actually explained why we couldn't open this to the USA. Later on is when I said that I love china, and it's true. We built this project as a way for Chinese to invest in USA economy. Anyways it didn't work, we closed the fund and refunded everyone

We wanted to do a proof of concept of a securitized asset token. It didn't work, our tech failed especially around doing KYC and coordinating with our Chinese partners. 24 hours in, we stopped and refunded everyone's money. No harm done.

Besides for the bad title, this is a pretty good article. 
I liked the article and the author. Marshall is a cool guy and hung out with me for many months before sending in his final draft to his editor. He spent alot of time trying to understand Bitcoin. Everyone should read this, and buy a copy! (happy to sign it for anyone, some people have asked me)
The article itself ends on kind of a somber note, but it went to print in January when things were not looking up for me. Everything has changed since then. [I'm no longer under house arres]( (yay!) and I'm consulting for  [some major corporations]( until my legal situation is over. From there, to the moon!!
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:36:45
Oh please. Bitinstant lost more money in mtgox than you did, and I covered it out of pocket. No one lost a dollar at Bitinstant. Even years later, I covered everyone out of pocket.

This twitter storm came from frustration. We could be focusing on privacy, and better upgrades to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:03:24
Yes, of course it's a slippery slope and $1 fee now could be $100 tomorrow 
If you see my next tweet: 
I've spent a lot of time recently studying RSK, and Lightning, both can be production ready THIS year. Coffee, micro transactions can be done on those layers so smoothly. 
IMHO I'm not a scaling expert nor a PhD in computer science but I trust those who are. This is a scaling question at the end of the day, how do we scale ?
Bigger blocks *could* be the answer, but the solutions available to us are nowhere near ready and once they are, it takes some time to safely plan a hard fork. As we've seen in the past 60 days, if BU were the reference client, we could have had some big issues. I do appreciate the work that the Core developers and the BU devs have done (even if I don't agree with the personalities of some). Developing Bitcoin is HARD, and most of the Core devs have been doing it for years. 
We have a good solution available to us, that's SegWit. Every smart person on both sides of the debate agree it's good technology and ready to go. Let's activate it. If it's not good enough in 1 year from now, we can revisit scaling and bigger blocks. 
Let's make this about scaling and not about who gets to control it.

Edit: feel free to pick my comment apart, but I'm going to the beach :-D
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:38:51
Alot of people think that was a sarcastic comment I made. It wasn't. For those who don't know, when all this mistrust/hong kong agreement/ reddit split was going on, I was in prison obvious to this. My comments and curiosity are purely trying to cut through the lies, FUD, hate, trolling on both sides and really understand what is going on. I don't have as much as a technical background as the developers, but my experience as CTO/CEO of various tech companies helps. I'm trying to understand, I'm asking questions. 
When someone says something about Roger, I call up Roger and have him clarify. When someone says Gavin says this, I call up Gavin. Same with Jihan, Blocktream and everyone else. I have so much respect for Gavin, Luke Jr, Peter Todd, Jeff G., Peter, Luke V, Andrew Stone and the developers on either side. Most of them are friendly people who just disagree with each other. When we stop blaming and personally attacking, its actually OK to disagree. We must find compromise. 
I understand Twitter/Reddit may not be the best places for this, but understand I am working on bringing people together and sorting through this.

@_date: 2017-03-22 22:07:29
I spoke to him the other day. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:57:51
That was a dick thing to say but Roger apologized to me personally. Sometimes things get tense, Roger is very passionate about his views. I try not to attack anyone personally. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:44:25
Of course I understand that. However we were extremely transparent. For example, the money we raised we couldnt legally use for operations, we had to use it to invest. Its a moot point now anyways. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:33:13
That was the plan. However doing a token offering and excluding a country is hard, so we cancelled it and refunded everyone 100%
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:28:12
That's funny ! Was a fun night hanging out with the Tampa Bay Bitcoin Meetup. We had a healthy blocksize debate with Roger Ver, Will Pangman of Airbitz, Anthony Di Iorio of JAXX, and myself Charlie Shrem

@_date: 2017-01-08 20:37:01
Exactly. Many people are worried about the Socio economic changes to a bigger blocks. Won't it be better to activate Segwit first and see how things play out before a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:41:44
Agreed. I think my point was, segwit gives an option to see how bigger blocks impact the ecosystem without having to hard fork

@_date: 2017-08-30 14:52:43
I think my point was, the NYA was created to create a compromise to 2mb to give Segwit a chance at adoption (which is gonna take a while). If we can really see adoption ramp up (exchanges, wallets, gaming, etc) quickly, we can see an effective blocksize of 2mb+ without *needing* a hard fork ! However the signatories should stand by what they signed unless the group as a whole decides to change paths.

I speak to many of them on a fairly consistent basis. This includes other implementations like Bcoin (I think extension blocks are cool, but needs more testing)
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:52:37
It's not an accusation, its basic knowledge. Taking the "technical debate" aside, what happens in a BU hard fork ? This client  and all the developers for the past 8 years are removed from Bitcoin and are replaced with this new one 
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:41:19
Those days were awesome! But we will likely look back on these days and say "Those days were awesome"
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:49:54


Actually, they are!  
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:58:19
My point for this tweet was block signing is like political polling, it can't be a measure because it only represents one aspect of the industry and signaling doesn't mean anything.  BitcoinUnlimited is not a production ready piece of software and as we see today, if it were the main Bitcoin client a super majority of nodes would have crashed. This is the 4th time in the past 90 days BU has had major technical issues ( 
This whole debate has become personal and I'm losing friends over it. It's NOT a technical debate, that's just smoke and mirrors. This is about power and control. It's about removing the 100's of developers that currently work on Bitcoin the past 8 years with a closed membership group of unknown devs.
P.S. to those who have mentioned Gavin, Jeff Garzik and Hearn switching to BU...have any of them actually contributed to BitcoinUnlimited code base?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:08:06
I doubt it, some of them will maybe, but not the ones I spoke to. (Assuming BU let's them). It's not about contribution though, it's about who are the lead developers and maintainers, the ones who get to push production code and merge requests. That will be handled by BU. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:56:37
You are assuming that Core will follow the hard fork (which I don't think would happen)

I think Bitpay transactions are 5-10% of any block (don't quote me on this). If they moved even a part of their transactions to Liquid, it could clear up that much of the mem pool

"It is really really trivial for supporters to generate sufficient transactions to make it happen
Think about the Day-Of.   It's going to be a party 
Plenty of people will spend fees for the honor of getting in that block.
 I personally would love to have oneof my tx's into that first block
 Its history making.
 bitcoin businesses and people will compete for the opportunity - free market in action. Think about it this way: when SegWit activates, we will know 3 months in advance _what block number_ will trigger the upgrade. You can create a time-locked transaction that only spends at that height or greater" - Jeff Garzik
Personally, I will pay $10 to get my TX into that first block, its a block for the history books - Charlie 


This is WHY SegWit will activate 1st, to show unity and goodwill from the miners and community. Once that happens, we have 3 months to plan and work on the together. - Charlie (Please don't start commenting that 3 months is not enough time for a HF, I've heard it before)

This is why  is so stupid.
If you want to fork for bigger blocks, I totally understand. Its a good socioeconomic experiment, I get it. But..
WHY IN HELL would you remove 
There is literally no downside to having  even if you want larger blocks.
 gives you malleability upgrades, linear scaling of sighash operations, signing of input values, versioning and so much more!
Now you have  which forked as a "political statement" that removes amazing tech for a "political statement"

BIP148 chain-split is "definitive"? Its reckless and will cause a chain-split, but thats OK because Luke wants

This is my real account.

I actually went on assets to speak to Mircea, which didn't respond. Actioncrypto was a company I consulted for that has since shut down anyways. Everyone was paid, no scam and no lost funds

It's a shame, I'm friends with the senior editor of BitsOnlime, he could have easily reached out to me for a quote but approved this sensationalist title instead.
There is no vulnerability, no one lost funds here. The author of the article basically says that someone can retrieve your 12 word backup seed if they have access to your device. IMHO if you aren't securing your device (pin, password, encryption, etc) how can you blame JAXX if someone steals your unsecured device and steals your money ? (I've yet to see a support ticket where this has happened)
We have had over 700k wallets created and they are evenly distributed across 9 platforms (windows, Mac, Linux, android, iPhone, etc) and support 15 coins and tokens)
YES there are always better ways to do security and we have and will always be making updates to them. 
Our support team has recently been expanded and I joined the company 2 months ago as COO. The growth we are seeing is amazing and we will always make sure everyone has the best experience.

We get it, and we are working on it. A fix is not going to happen overnight. In the meantime, secure your device, dont click phishing links and you will be OK. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:30:20
Agreed ! We have a solution for that. Right now, for security reasons, all signing, address generation and most API calls happen on your device. So the more tokens/coins you enable it slows the device down. Basically, we are moving all non-device-specific calls to the server and only having the important stuff like key signing, ect on the device. This will mean even if you have 20+ coins enabled, it will load super fast even on an old device.
I know some coins and tokens are bigger than others but we want support every project and give all of them a chance to succeed.

As long as we can keep the user experience simple and easy enough for first timers we will always investigate adding as many features as possible in the future I can see us supporting an advanced version and a simple one

Do other wallets secure better? Yes! Can we do a better job? Yes! We are, and we have solutions for all security related matters.

Sorry to hear that, what is your ticket number ? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:24:04
Actually, it is difficult when your wallet pairs and syncs on 9 platforms. We thought of a better solution and implementing it now. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:18:49
Hey Evan. Yes Jon and I are Facebook friends as well, you guys can message me there !
Security is *always* a problem, meaning that we always need to be on the cutting edge.
I wouldn't call this a vulnerability either. Do other wallets have better security ? Do other wallets have worse security ? Do other wallets have better or worse user experience ? Yes and No's to all of them. 
Having said that, we ARE working on a solution where encryption is much better and keep the ability to pair across all devices.
