Ye, too bad the next difficulty re target is in one day. Will be interesting to see if we can keep the fees low.

Is misleading with the all the exchanges holding everyones crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:31:09
There is r/BitcoinMarkets/ for that

Bugs in Bitcoin? We are at like 10 % segwit adoption currently. 
Quantum attacks? As if that won't break everything else that uses cryptography.. Which fork is gonna invent something useful that Bitcoin can not do?
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:02:54
Many dont seem to understand this, if bitcoin was going up this post will still be true, but no one would post it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:33:57
More adoption = less volatility.
And I don't think there are many who thinks it will become a world currency.

And looking at purchasing power of countries could paint a picture of NA and EU holding most from investing.

No, that is not how sound works ^ ^

Just saw this as well, chillin' on my sofa saw 30 % volume from some random exchange trading  LEEK???
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:15:24
Where do you get 80 % from?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:31:07
The exchange is no longer on coinmarketcap. Wonder if that volume was real?

Pretty sure it's Indian FUD. Whales move to usd  and tether in the beginning and the FUD triggers in small investors

I think the only services of that kind is accepting bitcoin payments then it gets converted to your fiat automatically.
Like bitpay.com or coinbase.com

If the price is 10k now then double the price and boom
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:12:15
can maybe help you.
Basically you will have to get ASIC miners to mine bitcoin.
 almost has monopoly on ASICs
w is a new company that just released their DragonMint 16T which is even better than bitmain BUT people are still waiting for their first batch to see if they are legit or just a scam.
And their miners are also out of stock. Maybe try and look into mining alt coins with gpus.
Remember to calculate your profit versus your electricity cost. And with 20k you are gonna need a garage or warehouse to put your rig inside.

I would recommend to send a small amount of BTC to your Ledger and then go through with the recovery process so you make sure you wrote the recovery words down correct and just to make you familiar with the process.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:20:46
If you don't trust bitcoin enough and want to be able to sell as soon as some bad news hit. Having your bitcoin in cold storage would not allow you to sell in time
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:18:12
Okay, correction happened, but not because people sold to buy Christmas stuff ^ ^
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:22:30
Fiat currency ≠ actual money
But you send it to an exchange and sell it .

Don't really know what to say. It does what it is supposed to^ ^
There isn't really anything to worry about. Maybe only how you want to protect your recovery words.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:10:13
On that same vein, get a fourth nano, in case you lose the third and keep it in a fourth location. Much easier than purchasing a third new one, waiting for shipping and stressing out about entering the correct phrase. ^ ^

You could, but the mempool size would go up if you wanted to sell on top of a crash. Its all about risk management, havin a % of your money in cold storage and some on exchange, and maybe some fiat ready to buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:34:50
Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:27:38
Price go up!
If everyone tomorrow decided that they would hodl until 10k then the price would spike to 10k tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:02:58
With one S9 antminer you have around 13.5 TH/s
The total hashing power of the network is around 10000000 TH/s
10000000/13.5/144 = 5144 days to get one block = 12.5 BTC reward today, but will be 6.25 BTC in 2021
144 blocks are mined each day
I think i got the calculation right ^ ^
Edit: This is assuming the difficulty wont increase
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:44:03
You don't have to make yourself a target telling the internet your name, reddit account, your exchange and amount of BTC. 
Make sure to use the vault option at least and 2 step (preferably Google Authenticator)

Why ask this question without researching the basics about bitcoin?

I don't use paper from ledger, just some plain paper with the words in order and no numbers. Just so if people accidentally get their hands on them they wont know exactly what it is. Ye and minimum of 2 trusted locations.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:33:34
The difficulty of mining increases so we only find a new block with around 10 min intervals. You can mine with a very low hashrate and be lucky and get the next block and the 12.5 BTC reward.
The big mining pools consist of multiple people working together to share the profits.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:33:32
You can mine alone, but it will never be profitable with the hashpower of a single S9. I don't know much about mining, but you should read a bit more about it before buying a S9
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:01:49
I'm new to bitcoin. But as far as i understand, if you buy 1 BTC now you will receive 1 of the BTC2x, people know this and therefore value the bitcoin as so. After the fork you no longer receive BTC2x from buying BTC. So wouldn't people value bitcoin the same deducted the BTC2x value after the fork. 
Don't know if I simply need to look more into it ^^
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:51:12
We can just start using satoshi μBTC mBTC or cBTC
