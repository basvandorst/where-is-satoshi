i think it went great...he compared it to PayPal and western union and explained how bitcoin is like the early days of internet...overall, i think it went great!

sell me all your bitcoins for $500 each...i buy them all
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:45:51
Mtgox put out bad news so they can buy all your bitcoins under $600 and resell them back much higher and make millions...they said u can cash out because they wanted your bitcoins at cheap prices...they bought at $500 and will resell at much higher...good luck

Great opportunity to buy more bitcoin at cheap prices...thanks!!!

they arrested him because the gov't wants to get in on the bitcoin action before the huge run up in bitcoin value...after he donates several million dollars worth of bitcoins to couple top officials, he will be set free...nothing to worry about...they just want his money!!!

because i'm still searching for new ideas for a website.

system upgrade 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:29:03
Tried to login Coinbase account and it said "You've exceeded the maximum number of attempts for today. Please wait 24 hours and try again." i only tried signing in once!
I bet after 24hrs, price will be $500+ again...they will sell me their coins that they bought at $420 for $500+ each...must be nice...this same thing happened last time the price went below $450 then ran up to $650...didn't let me buy...maybe it's my iphone browser...i still like coinbase, but this is not right!!!

here is my idea...what do u guys think?
i will pay one cent per visitor to FreeBitcoins.com
No need to watch videos or ads or perform tasks...just visit my site and collect your money and go...nothing to do...i will pay each visitor 1 cent via bitcoin per hour.
This might not seem like lot, but most faucet sites are paying less than tenth of a cent only if you perform certain task.
I will make money by having ads on my site to support this idea.
What do u guys think?

good news is out...u can withdraw cash!!!
They just bought your cheap coins and will re-sell them to you at higher price and then report bad news again and buy your coins from u again at cheap price and resell them to u at higher price...u see how this works...u loose money while they make millions...good luck...just buy and hold if u want to make real money!!!

Reporters, journalist, writers, etc...post false incomplete stories about bitcoin without doing their research.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:03:29
sell me your bitcoins for $500...i take them all
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:05:59

lucky they didn't ask him about Charlie's arrest...i bet Fred knew about it before this interview since Charlie got arrested Sunday...lol
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:47:13
Buy low, sell high...this is low right now...time to buy...i bet mtgox and other big exchanges bought at the lows and will resell at higher prices...
Bitcoin will be $800+ within 2 weeks...watch and see...good luck
