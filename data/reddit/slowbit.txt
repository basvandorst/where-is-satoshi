The nokia 3210 sold 128 million units. It was one of the best selling phones of all time! Outselling most modern phones! It wasn't at all an underdog!

I'm not sure what definition of WWW you are using that was introduced in 1989 but sure, still 14% of the entire US population is a level of adoption literally hundreds of times the level of adoption bitcoin has. So that seems like a very bad example. As it's not an example of something struggling at 1 million for five years then later gaining acceptance at some point later than that.

The Internet is older than 25 years, the World Wide Web is within 25 years but grew far more rapidly with 50% of Americans using it within five years. Not at all like Bitcoin.

It's weird you are comparing US users of internet to bitcoin users globally? Why are you doing that?

All of those things had millions of users though?

This thread is now just "name popular technologies and pretend they started as underdogs without that actually happening". 
Someone just list the iphone already.

What time line are you even remotely using to make that? What are you defining as the first smart phone where it struggled for 5 years then took off? It was far less than 5 years between invention and mass adoption OR you are using a definition of smart phone so wide that smart phones pre-date 1990 anyway.
