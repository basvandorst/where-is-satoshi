Awesome, so what's the most important thing to you? Getting paid back with Bitcoin over Venmo?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:35:32
Awesome, so do you think you're friends/roommates would pay you back with BTC? Thanks for the bug heads up as well
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:22:23
That's great feedback, thanks!
So is the restaurant bill splitting use case the most important to you? Or do you envision using it for other things as well?
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:28:28
Would your friends/whoevers paying you back be able to pay you in BTC, or would they need the ability to use local fiat as well?
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:21:26
1. You pay for the whole bill yourself
2. Open glassjar, enter the bill total and how many people it's split between (at this point we're just splitting evenly but we can add custom amounts if requested)
3. Invite your Venmo friends and/or phone/email contacts to pay you back via Venmo or Bitcoin.
*You will need to login with Venmo once so Glassjar can access your Venmo friends

Have you tried using anything else that lets people pay you back in fiat that gets converted automatically to bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:25:58
That depends on where you live! Venmo is limited to the US (afik) and in most parts is pretty popular with the younger demographic &lt;30 yrs

What would the ideal get paid back via Bitcoin app look like for you?
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:48:55
Thanks for the feedback :)
The restaurant use case is just one example, have you considered whether it would be useful in any other use case?
I believe those TOS are designed to line up with using Venmo as a payment provider. We would review them accordingly with BTC integration.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:48:39
So you would rather receive bitcoins than fiat? Why's that?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:05:01
Glad to see someone read the title! Haha. We're really interested in understanding how people would use this. So, how many of your friends have bitcoin? And how many do you think would pay you back with it?
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:18:57
Well the app is currently focussed around getting paid back for group use cases, e.g. dinner with friends, paying your gas bill with your roommates etc
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:38:09
Thats great! What do you think you'd mainly use it for? And who would you use it with?
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:39:26
Is it likely your friends could pay you back with BTC? Or would they need to be able to pay with other currency as well?
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:12:39
Cool, would you want to get paid back in BTC in all those instances?
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:20:26
Haha that's a good answer
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:57:28
Cool, so it's something you yourself would use? Do you know what you'd use it for primarily?
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:07:19
Do you think you would use it if you could charge them in fiat and you recieve BTC? Or would you rather just recieve fiat in that instance?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:14:33
Venmo is an app available in the US that links with your bank acc and lets you send money to other venmo users easily.
Bill splitting is a big &amp; pretty vague problem. What we're trying to figure out here is whether people want to be able to do that via BTC
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:43:36
Cool. Is there any use case where you would want to be paid back in BTC? Is it something you have a problem with currently?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:33:57
I think we all have some friends like that... Out of interest, what do you think the chances of onboarding your friends to use BTC to pay you back are? And once again please be brutal ;)
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:56:07
It's mean to be easier to get the info across about what the site is, but it's possible we just made it confusing :/

You should look at
