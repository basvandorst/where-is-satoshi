Don't wish me luck, believe me, I don't want it to crash either - I'm just trying to be realistic man. This has happened before. Perhaps not with bitcoin, but every single isolated market on earth has experienced it. We should learn from the past.

And now it's down for me

Sorry, but that's just not true. The bubble could easily burst and send the market into a panic tailspin, resulting in a huge crash for BTC. It has happened before in history in the stock market, and while BTC is different in some cases, the market has already proven to be extremely volatile in an upward trend... so imagine what it could do on a downward spiral, especially if the mainstream media starts doomsaying that it's time to sell.
It's only shooting up right now because it's being artificially pumped by some people who want to short the market, I guarantee it. BTC will survive that, but the market WILL crash eventually, and it very well might crash hard.

Yeah, no, that's an incredibly bold statement. When the correction happens it is going to hit hard. I honestly expect a drop back to ~$7k or so at some point. Maybe less.

OP is right, but everyone here would rather drink the kool-aid.

Mark Cuban is correct.

If I withdrew/sold the exact same amount of money as I initially put in, I don't have to pay any tax do I?

Uh, maybe you should reconsider your friendship if this actually worries you....
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:25:49
Yep...  is it bad I kind of want it to plummet just so I can justify buying a bunch more?
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:14:45
People were saying this a week ago too and it's still gone up since then. Just jump in now.

Ya dun no.

Uh, how about tonight
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:36
Eh, it's good and bad.
If majority of whoever buys bitcoin futures decides they predict Bitcoin will tank at any given time, there is a chance the market could respond by bitcoin actually tanking.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:48:46
it means bitcoin just went to wall street
also they are going to sell btc on the futures market which will inevitably affect btc itself, they'll be predicting what btc does basically

Meh, get real. You can't pay your bills with Bitcoin yet. You can t pay your student loans with them either.
Until that day comes, people are going to be interested in Bitcoin's fiat value, because if it suddenly becomes worth a shit ton, you may suddenly find yourself with the power to make your mortgage or loans go away because you made an investment.
Some people here want to use Bitcoin as the future of money. Others see an opportunity to invest and hope the price jumps so that they can take care of the very real monetary demons that are holding them down in the real world. Criticizing people for wanting to do that and wanting to take care of themselves is total bullshit.

My friend does this too, sent me basically the same message on Thurs
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:36:58
That's such bullshit.
I'm talking about 2017 to now, obviously. Bitcoin fucking skyrocketed through the roof until it hit it's peak at $20k. And then it didn't just decline, it dropped like a ton of bricks. And now we have been fucking sitting at $6k-$7k for God knows how long, briefly touching $9k again before once more falling. And it had been falling more than it has been rising.
I bought Bitcoin over a year ago but it's time to face the music. Everyone who was going to buy has. During the giant price spike to $20k it was all over the news and everyone was talking about it. Now pretty much no one gives a shit. Everyone who wanted in got in already, and the rest of the world has moved on.
It would be nice to actually have more places take Bitcoin as an actual currency, but as an *investment*, which many many people used Bitcoin as, it became tulips all over again.

just saying, everyone who called "tulipmania" was right
