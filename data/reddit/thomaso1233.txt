@_date: 2018-05-25 18:58:12
Im sick of these kind of predictions. Same for tom lee. So annoying.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:15:03
Dude. Get some fresh air..enjoy Life and forget that you invested more than you can afford at ath..or cash out and gtfo. Youre not made for any spekulative Investments.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:25:54
break the fuck out. now 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:58:18
well. that escalated quickly
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:51:37
good jump, but volume not rising
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:12:05
why should it be high? no real dump, no real pump for a while now. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:06:10
10k today
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:43:16
Why isnt meghan wearing a bitcoin wedding dress. Thats the attention we need

The beginning of an another bart simpson pattern. 8300$ in a few hrs
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:39:51

@_date: 2018-05-15 19:59:37
btc wants to breakout but theres so much resistance. insane. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:08:23
Whats the next title if btc breaks 10k?
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:41:21
The Perfect 1h bart simpson 
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:23:45
Dude your just posting a wall of emotional bullshit. Think again what youve invested in.  But you rather should get out of this market, your post indicates that youre not able to handle it.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:42:26
i want a $500 pump right now

@_date: 2018-05-13 19:38:49
Drop to $8420 needed for that. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 10:14:01

The idiot is back lmao
@_date: 2018-05-12 10:11:52
It wont. And you deserve this for this shitmove. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 14:40:50
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:41:27
Still relatively low volume. Bad 
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:37:16
the 1h chart could give us the most beautiful bart ever seen. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:21:01
so tripple bottom (7100, 7300, 7400) completed. should be a breakout soon
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:40:58
holy shit whats happening
rebuying tomorrow if it stays like this. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:46:41
damn what heros you are. what do you expect longerm ? ath again? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:07:11
found the bottom at 5777. Right now were in a bullish market. 50k eoy. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:51:10
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:16:55
im just scared that we are building up some good prices for weeks, only to dump $1k within one day as the last times :D 
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:33:36
descending triangle, tripple bottom. 
only the volume fucked bitcoin up
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:22:00
think longterm. invest now and youll hvae a great profit. 
but crypto obv isnt made for you 
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:37:59
prepare your vegeta memes
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:33:09
Weekends as always good. Dips from tuesday on.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:10:54
mood to sell getting bigger. a dump to 8k by evening / night possible before we retest 9k 
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:20:51
lots of people will sell their profits made from this pump before the weekend, hopefully we stay at 8.5k range till monday. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:07:08
Agreed. The 1h chart was too green. That dip was the logical consequence. All good. Lets hold the 11k
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:17:35
Why should it crash to 6k with no huge fud. Damn so much bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:16:54
Ur talking and talking every day. Gimme some screenshots of your btc trading achievements :)
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:48:58
Tether tx After pump. So quite a bullshit tweet
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:21:52
allright. lets retest the 8k again. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:46:06
The sunday before aswell. Things have changed
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:41:16
Tbh. Good estimation.  Thats how you should express scepticism
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:16:51
good luck with your fiat, wont ever happen again
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:36:11
Haha. Sad that so much ppl expect this after these pumps meanwhile. Whatever 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:01:11
dont sell this as a fact. you never know, ok? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:43:17
so from this logic we can expect a huge 500$ dump for bitcoin if time arrives. we will see what happens but the storm pump isnt normal, thats fact! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:06:43
How much u lost since december bro. Feel your pain
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:07:51
why are u even here? troll somewhere else ?
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:52:36
Decent volume..7.5k by tomorrow. Everything seems good. Need some bullish news next week
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:03:54
Thanks for your estimation ath buyer 
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:26:47
these sidewards trends havent been good the last days, no breakout to expect, morelikely downwards
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:06:19
nice pump whales, 8k by tomorrow morning. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:23:58
gtfo out of here kid and make some bigmacs for me 
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:11:45
we will stay between 7 and 10k for a while, so btc did the last years in lower price. relax
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:25:42
im hodling until it hits 0 m8
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:20:52
Cuz you use every possibility to try to proove what a great trader you are with so much arrogance and retarded posts. So show us how good u r :)
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:10:23
no, bitcoin is not really predictable. i would say, that there has to be a dip to maybe 11k or 10.9k since were going up for a few days now. but nothing is save. in longterm, if bitcoin goes his way, it wont matter if you invest at 11k or 10k if everything goes well. 
we cant advice you what you have to do, if you dont feel comfortable to invest right now cuz the prise has risen much just wait a few days and hope, it goes down a bit.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:26:00
those TAs are just shit. it will never go to 5k, except tether bomb explodes or countries like South Korea prohibit crypto.  bitcoin falls or goes up with news, which arent implemented in TAs. so there are many TAs predicting 20k by summer, which one to believe then? just bullshit. lets see what happens 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:41:53
the unprofessional got bitcoin to almost 20k. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:04:34
it has always been a trade object
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:28:09
U mean u bought at 8701 at sold at 8700.5
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:12:46
all is fine, what do people expect? 2000$ jumps every 2 days? if we hold the 8.5k for now, we will be fine for the rest of march. just relax, ofc idiots like goldbergerr start to post here after the 300$ dip, those posting histories give me eye cancer
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:17:56
Ready for the 700$ dump?
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:25:33
its not, but whats the sense to troll here with these comments? you are a bad person
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:54:47
deleted, ofc :D that "therippleaffect" guy ist just hilarious
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:35:45
The theory that people buy bitcoin when stock market crashes is absurd and has no substance. Crypto had its ath when stock market had aswell. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:59:00
Relax. Probably a whale cashing out since 9k didnt fall
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:29:37
im in a positive mood again. 10k by tomorrow morning, heading to 12k till friday
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:51:04
let the fomo begin.
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:13:43
10/10 would trust
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:20:48
ridicolous manipulation - im out for a few months, hodl and chill 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:03:14
20k volume is absolutely good. what are u even talking
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:22:28
guess market cannot decide whether the binance thing is good or bad 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:28:01
show me a proof how much u make of these dumps you "predict" after 30 minutes they have happened haha, damn looking for attention and hate in reddit, your life must be great
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:14:50
just waiting for that bear market resums guy to post his shitty TA
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:54:10
Rogee That.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:21:43
Here we go. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:04:44
relax lol. last year it was around 1k for many month
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:41:31
Red dildooooooo
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:17:05
Market manipulation at its best.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:03:59
"TAs" to 6000 are quite easy to make if you see the reactions of the people after the last weeks. So annoying that everybody predicts this shit because they "know" some FUD will appear the coming days probably
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:31:04
if you want to hodl it doesnt really matter imo whether you get in at 9.5k or 8k. 
Im still not convinced about this jump which came out of nowhere. 1 year ago BTC was at $1k, march isnt the best btc month traditionally. So in my opinion we might stay between 8 and 10k for a while. 
but as always: its not really predictable, do what your gut says :D 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:17:40
Patience doesnt seem to be your friend
Btc 1 year ago: 1000$
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:02:14
Steady Rise to 10k by the end of april. We found the bottom
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:17:38
yahoo will save us all u fool
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:25:07
1 year ago... btc was at $1k .. relax.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:58:54
true, we had that $500 dips in a few minutes lately. this is a slow dip, guess the bottom will be around 7k and from april on we gonna go up slowly
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:11:34
damn, u might one of the most dumb persons here
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:24:28
never mind, who wrote this shit! 
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:50:44
some guys really dont want the 8k to be crossed. sad 
the more tries fail, the more we go to 7k by the day
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:22:14
Short and intense. Just the way u like it i bet
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:12:22
Seems like weekend retests 8k again. Then 10k by april if no fud appears
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:17:50
Nice pump. 800$ dump in 15 minutes
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:35:35
When moon?
When lambo?
Will future affect price?
Will chinese new year affect price?
Bull market!
Bear market!
Ctfc Tether!
Drop to 5.8k soon
10k soon!
Btc will never rise again!
Forgot sth?
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:38:50
these sell wall since 2 hours are scary. might be a bad night :-/ 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:35:14
these comments are so cute after a 200$ drop. gonna recover to 8.1k again in a few hours, then you can come back at the weekend. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:47:17
Little run. 400$ dump then in 2 hours. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:02:51
Welcome to a new Episode of BOT WARS. Now, live on GDAX. Who will win? The 167 Sellwall or the 2 50 and more little Buywalls ? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:02:46
Bullish news needed going viral
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:36:55
The low volume is strange tbh. Was 100k days ago
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:22:59
pump to 7.4k, steady decrease to 7.1k -&gt; pump to 7.3k -&gt; decrease to 7k
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:29:17
moving from 7850 to 8.1k in 8 hours, then down to 8050 within 2 hrs, going to 8k within 1 hour, then to 7850 in 2 hours -&gt; repeat 
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:28:57
This little volatility is insane
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:55:01
in approx 3 hrs
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:46:06
9k by thursday
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:02:53
above 8.5k by the end of sunday and we will good for the new week (hopefully no fud then)
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:42:44
so what you lownut. didnt say sth else, however, mass media spread FUD at january  so people sold a lot . 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:41:58
no one can say, i invested at 11k$, bought again at 7.3k$
imo its still a good price to buy, considering the possibilities btc and some alts can go. 
but still you have to feel comfortable and decide finally 
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:37:10
market is just going sideways as it did the last years. Relax and hodl. _MAYBE_ there might be little impact after tomorrow &amp; 16th but i dont really think so. We need a steady and healthy growth and the fact that we are solid at 8.5k for almost a week is a good sign. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:19:44
im still sceptical too. we will see what happens, $500 dump like the last weeks would be fcking demotivating
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:33:23
some guys dont want to. good run to 8.6k and then huge sellwalls out of nothing. dropping it at least to 8.5k
its a trap
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:32:25
Do you mean the weekend dip that made btc up 1k the last 3 weekends?
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:13:24
8500$ is quite hard to pass and hold right now. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:02:12
Important to hold the 11k or even 11.1k today on sunday. The next week 11.5k would be the goal if no FUD happens. lets go, i would also appreciate it if the altcoins would benefit from bitcoin good runs ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:27:54
the 10k crossing was fucking sick. there were like ten 30 BTC buys , some 20 BTC buys  and some 35. whales are back. hope they keep it above 10k 
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:16:27
10k by today afternoon, to drop to 9.5 within 5 minutes the night
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:24:08
Ban and gtfo.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:12:12
nothing. just a random post, without any content. 
My suggestion is to buy everything till this evening. It will go up as hell tonight.
no one can predict it right now, its good that theres not much fud right now though
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:35:38
buy your shitcoin ada lmao. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:12:13
rip 8k, now its getting interesting
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:10:04
im excited to see when wales buy everything like they did when btc hit 5.9k. there was a 1k pump immediately
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:41:00
such a fast growth right now. im still sceptical but hoping the best. at least i bought more at 7.3
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:45:34
No one knows. I think 8.5k is still a good time to buy in if u want to hodl concerning the possibility that the worst times are behind us. 
Do what your gut says.
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:40:52
Yea as expected. So u better stop posting here. Thanks in advance and have a good life.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:27:02
i dont get it aswell. why the fuck would you sell so much btc at 7.9k lol 
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:08:02
Higher highs, higher lows.
If that low is at 11.2k i will be happy. Going to stabilize 11.5k then
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:46:53
why is there hate against coinbase? is there any specific reason i missd? never had problems there 
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:38:06
6h chart looks way too green, so the rest do. we gonna retest the 11k again, from there we will go to 12k 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:14:06
its easter. people will close their positions till next week, probably below 6k by tuesday. then we will see the rise of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:55:24
dont worry, bought BTC at 14k to trade some in Altcoins, still not worrying. well see what happen till q4 2018. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:53:49
bullish breakout to 8.5 and 9k by thursday please. thanks
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:26:58
is the cftc hearing for tether in 2 days? lets hope the best..
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:08:00
Pure speculation. We should prepare for a another big bull run soon. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:21:53
hes not allowed to sell till september
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:40:20
8.3k is the key resistance line, from there we bounce up 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:54:56
it wasnt difficult to predict a crash after that run. lots of ppl did
expecting 1k at the end of 2018 is just ridicolous. no reason for that scenario 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:17:59
Damn you little boi on the internet. Go back to mommy and daddy please and do not disturb the adults
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:29:49
many ppl invested much money at 15k+$, thought, they will be rich fast.
then mass media jumped on that fud train and the mood was just bad. still believing the usecase btc and other altcoins have. lets go
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:08:08
what a comment lol 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:40:03
Yeah easy life for daytrader atm. Wait for 8.7 sell and buy back at 8.5
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:46:22
this charts have never been right, so much bullshit :D 
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:24:17
damn, how does it feel to look for some attention here every day twice with shitty TAs 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:18:04
14.2. future ends
16.2. chinese new year --&gt; might be more buy power after it 
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:37:52
i just hodl and chill, draw your shitty TAs and be happy with some attention you gain for 4k predictions LOL 
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:39:06
The 24h volume ist just way too low for a run to 9k or 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:02:41
Ive read it in a discord. Asked for a legit source then but they couldnt deliver except rumours from an youtube  Insider.  So nevermind. Hoped some1 knows in here.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:23:49
Aight nostradamus. See you in 7 months if u rebuy at ath haha
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:37:19
going to be a tough weekend. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:01:42
USA and EU gave everything to keep btc around 10k. its your turn asia. good night. 
(meanwhile waking up at 7am CET tomorrow, btc at 8.9k)
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:22:37
i wish it went up that fast and easily
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:45:30
9k by the end of the week due to good g20 news and more. Buy now or regret
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:10:48
No way after the 300% decrease from 18k.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:56:53
rip 8k
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:30:43
Nonsense. Child porn in blockchain is atleast in Germany a huge Topic. People might be scared that bitcoin can get prohibited. Binance regulations in japan made lots of ppl sell. And ppl waited for g20 results so they cashed out and it dropped to 7.8k.
Those Comments are just annoying. It might get down but it might also get up in a few weeks. No one knows. Lets Hope the best
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:59:12
yes they are, wish whatever you want btc to do
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:13:19
battle for 11k is strong. altcoins giving up already
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:13:33
If 12k falls the fomo will be so strong
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:24:57
announcing pumps n dumps on reddit, youre a genious
can some1 ban this kid already please? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:48:41
thinking the same. they would be idiots to print more if they have problems with law, so hope this is a good sign
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:28:17
sure 7.5k ? not 7.4k? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:08:06
100k by the end of march
then down to 4k 
then 200k by june. 
srsly: no one can say, what will happen
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:31:47
i can guarantee it wont come
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:51:39
clearly market manipulation going on right now
no reason for a 700$ drop
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:59:58
Yeah would be nice. If ppl realize it wont drop below 9.5k or more anymore then the fomo starts and we go to 12k. But its weekend. Om happy with 9.8-10k.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:46:57
Gimme the mathematical proof right nau
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:34:12
My god. Relax. Close your charts. Its mid february. 6k 13 days ago. Now were at 10.5k quite savely. The breakout to 11.8k was too fast. Lets stay above 10k and we will be fine for march
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:28:45
it wont affect the price as the futures didnt. just a hype, nothing will happen after the 16th. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:46:23
this abcde guy, predicting btc to hit 10k never again with his ridicolous TAs, is probably jerking off as fuck right now 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:53:28
no problem grandpa. yet, blaming a longterm reader for his time of registration after a normal comment is just retarded. 
good luck for your trading. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:29:34
Your life must suck so hard
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:14:09
so true
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:05:11
500$ dump in 1 hour then. Lul
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:13:11
7.2k by tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:12:15
as long as it stays above 10k im happy. we went from 6k to almost 12k within i think 11 days or sth? thats  not healthy and everyone knows it. little correction for a few days to 10k and its absolutely fine. let the weak hands sell. its mid february, some guys need to learn to relax and see the long term development.
we got some good news for bitcoin recently, it will rise again, next step would be 12k then in march
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:51:35
would this post be more correct if i were a redditor for 3 months.. or 3 years? explain me sir
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:59:41
Oh its you again. Read some bs posted by u earlier this day.
Maybe change your nickname to moderateidiot?
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:21:57
are  u rly that dumb or just pretending? hope the second. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:57:12
Low volume? Are we seeing different things?
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:14:43
Btc is at 8.5k. Great buy in chance imo
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:54:25
there is no crash. we went from 6k to 11k. all good, what are you talking man 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:34:33
Did they get it back?
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:25:53
So u know nothing. Thanks for that Beautiful estimation
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:34:24
damn somehow i enjoy these red lines. i have capitulated anyway haha
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:26:26
Buy low sell high? Damn your secrets are out this space little keyboard warrior ;) 
No other strategies needed. Just a proof for your success you mention every day. Your turn kid
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:18:20
Ive experienced so many of these pumps recent weeks. Just followed by 500$ dumps within 5 minutes. I dont trust this shit anymore:(
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:24:47
8.7k! Going to 8.8 for 2 or 3 hours and then to 8.5 again within 5 minutes
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:07:40
i dont trust it. Dump inc 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:24:29
correct cuz it goes from 19.999 to 20100 instantly
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:08:29
Its february 'pal'. Relax and let people do what they wanna do. Dont be so arrogant and stop being an asshole. Thanks
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:27:58
asia waking up soon, either taking the gains or pumping the shit out of btc
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:02:31
be more friendly, my friend
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:16:40
bought at 9.9k. 10 seconds later dump to 9.7k
we are all in the same boat bro
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:33:49
so the first one, thanks for confirming.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:30:30
no proof of strenghts? where have u been the last week? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:28:56
true. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:59:43
Either EU is completely buying the shit out of themselves or its market manipulation at its finest
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:13:25
if this is true and they are backed up by japanese gov, this is fkn huge 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:34:40
Gimme proofs for the bulltrap and your advice not to buy
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:14:12
no it isnt, the uptrend was just too fast. little "correction" (its not even a fcking correction". we were at 6k beginning of feb. chillax
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:47:38
ure checking the chart every  5 minutes during watching! ADMIT IT
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:44:38
Lol relax. Yesterday we just broke the 10k. What do fckn expect 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:03:22
Dont trust this uptrend yet. The volume is so low, yet it goes up so easily. Seems more like market manipulation
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:44:57
Relax dude. Steady growth is the best thing. If you hodl get out and dont check the chart everd hour.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:43:03
Bitcoin is fcking dominating. Bad for my altcoins
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:40:57
Im not selling shitty tas as facts every day every 3 hours. Just annoying. Im sceptical too bout hype and development but these posts, jesus. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:16:46
what pump n dump are you even talking about. were between 9.5 and 10.3 now . everything is cool, now its weekend and the next week well see where it goes. probably it will stay above 10k then, directing to 11k. 
relax dude, were still at 9850k. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:27:22
start =! end of futures
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:54:43
will be an exciting night. 9.3k wall is strong right now, hope it can hold the level between 9.2 and 9.3
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:19:25
mood swings here are insane lol.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:25:29
quite healthy that we are staying around 8k. hopefully we can hold that level for a while. no breakout to expect till end of february imo. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:55:28
8.8k support is strong. lets hope for a good night
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:05:21
and so it begins. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:19:48
There is no crash right now. 
Some bad stuff happened (Binance downtime, Nano Hack) but the price is very stable at 7.8k - 8.5k which is a good sign. It can go sidewards for a few weeks. Then it will breakout if people, that are waiting right now, realize that there is no new drop to below 7k.
No FUD right now for bitcoin which is great also. Im excited for the development of the stockmarkets tomorrow :) 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:39:57
Bots. Manipulation. Will be like this a few weeks oe months probably 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:28:43
buy the hype, sell the news. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:33:07
Your name fits dude.  Pay ur fkn taxes
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:17:52
higher lows, higher highs. still healthy whats happening imo. 10k hold for the next day would be quite nice 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:43:31
holding the 10k till tomorrow would be great for the rest of the week. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:43:13
people are tired of buying. no hype at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:05:46
Can u stop spamming bullshit?
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:27:52
Where is that bear market resumes?guy
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:59:17
I need an algrebaic equation
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:13:47
whales realising their winnings. relax guys, if it stays at 9.5k its healthy
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:26:54
how much u lost bro since december, when u invested
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:29:15
definitely ? or just half definitely 
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:58:10
20k volume isnt low. The lower the volume the easier to manipulate generally
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:51:49
Looks like we found the bottom. From now on we see a steady rise and a new rallye from august on. Have fun and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:24:42
wow what a dip. getting tired of it, see you next month
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:55:17
wtf is happening :D 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:28:10
What r u talking
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:07:32
introduce yourself first , little kid 
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:41:42
I agree on this.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:29:40
so you knew the api is going to get fucked? youre a fucking genious man
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:06:09
Is this 24000 BTC 24hrs volume normal ? just saw 100k few days ago 
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:17:05
Btw, if we get to 7800 very soon, we have the perfect rounded bottom. Bullish af, but well, your predicitions are just adjusted to current situation and have been wrong forever lmao
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:07:30
Bulls r back
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:04:26
These $400-500 dumps within 30 minutes suck. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:19:24
if it drops to 4k or 5k the volume will increase automatically to an acceptable level, even though its WE. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:07:08
EW and TA are just bs concerning BTC 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:08:17
goooood morning vietnam
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:24:49
We need to break 6800 and furthermore 6850 very soon and hold it, otherwise its getting rejected to 6000 again
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:25:36
7535.5 
what a strange resistance point 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:51:27
damn those jumps below and aboev 10k are scary. hope 10k stays strong when asia wakes up 
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:10:23
relaxing at 9.2k for a while, preparing for the 8.5k dump 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:44:37
good point internet kid, anything else ? ;) 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:14:46
we had that sidewards trend at 8.5k as well for almost 2 days, followed by a 600$ drop. lets hope the best, it wont happen again
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:31:13
these buyorders, jesus. 5 25er BTC buys within a minute
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:11:29
Thats not normal. Where u bought the btc? And youve sent it to the deposit adress which is shown on binance?
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:38:44
We look so oversold actually. Ive 400$ on the sideline. Waiting for a dip. Well. Somehow it doesnt happen haha
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:08:09
longterm 8k is still a good price. remember when it first dropped to 8k and everybody said "wow, what a good price to buy in".. and now its called fomo already cuz we come from 6.5k
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:46:22
Okay Thanks for Clarification
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:16:15
So what is the truth?
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:53:31
$6600 you mean, i agree with you. the pattern is so similiar to the last weeks, the pumps were just a bit bigger and in one turn. 
anyway, if we hold 7k today, then it might be a good week since the public holidys are over tomorrow and people might spent a bit 
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:34:03
Never had Problems with coinbase. However Use gdax with your coinbase acc
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:02:52
Ever considered to become a comedian?
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:44:04
no one knows. in longterm 8k might be still a good price to buyin, i dont see a drop 6k again unless there is massive fud
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:25:33
Do you even want crypto/bitcoin to succeed or why post such bullshit without any basis?
It wasnr even a pump, get your arguments straight
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:33:25
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:49:44
just hodl and you will be fine with these prices. it just dipped to 8050 now, maybe youll just wait for the weekend
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:55:30
how much u lost bro 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:11:17
Vegeta, whats bitcoin price?
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:05:26
7800 has to stay. Next stop is 7500 then
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:58:20
damn your selfconfidence must be very low to that opinionated right now 
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:38:20
Tested 9.8k and we failed. Drop to 9.2k necessary now. Everything is fine. New run now 
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:49:45
Volume too low to stay above 8k. Dammit
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:45:11
so will we have another bart simpson pattern to get finished? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:57:33
I asked how much u bet
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:27:49
strange buywalls
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:48:54
it could be right, but could be also wrong
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:13:25
what a resistance at $8140
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:08:39
Good morning asia. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:06:19
above 7.5k for the weekend and its fine for the next week
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:19:54
Good morning japan.
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:22:53
damn 10k is tough to reach. hope we have a good week with some good news
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:16:30
break out fkin bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:57:21
The sellwall at $8090 is so big. We need more volume
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:19:29
of course it is, what do you expect? trade volume increases when btc rises or drops fast. the shortsqueeze happened, btc had a big run and now things are settling down (maybe til  tax season ends?). its weekend, people are closing their positions. 
relax, it cant go up $1k every day, if it drops $500 e.g. ,trade volume will go back to 20k immediately
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:30:12
what are you talking man? get some help
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:02:33
Dude. Get some help. Crypto obv isnt made for you 
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:27:56
the bart simpson pattern has started again
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:13:15
Yeah if. If if if. 
Just buy and hodl. Still a good Time to buy
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:12:46
500$ per day wouldnt be healthy tbh 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:13:07
can imagine that lots of ppl selling due to that smart contract erc20 token stuff 
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:14:54
the lower the market cap the more shitty altcoins die at least
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:09:22
$9250 new resistance. Would be great if it holds above
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:37:52
Hes not allowed to sell until september or sth.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:02:09
at least we can say that 6.5k is finally the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:58:53
i dont trust this shit, $6.5k again tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:58:29
relax brother, crypto is still at the beginning and youll have to wait maybe a few years till u get huge gains. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:50:57
Wont happen. Same shit as wallstreet bonusses
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:11:14
Thought he isnt allow to sell anything till september 2018. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:04:43
um.. nope? between 8750 and 8900, depending on exchange
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:32:23
insane resistance close below 7.4k 
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:41:14
We might dip below it a few times before we go to 8k. Im excited to see what asia does. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:43:03
I want another short squeeze
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:57:29
8.6k seems like a solid base. will stay in these ranges for a while, volume will get low too. 
1 year ago: $1200. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:15:32
Such a low volume. The last months this was an Indicator for a drop coming. Lets see what happens 
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:59:43
In fact you think. Eeeh nice try
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:30:49
The problem with these pumps is that we get a lower low since more than a month. Counting from feb 6th. Everyone can see that its gonna drop to 6.5k again within a few hrs
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:59:40
Bitfinex is almost at 9k again, while gdax is at 8750 lol
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:11:18
With this little volume we will see 6k 
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:06:26
still easter holidays, we will see a rise from tuesday on. bottom might be at 5.5k or sth
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:28:29
fk those shorters at 8100
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:07:29
Dread it. Run from it. Destiny (9k) still arrives
- Thanos
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:31:19
Nah. Sunday and monday dip. Above 8.8k or 9k in best case  would be good. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:12:53
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:34:24
I think not. Fact.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:51:38
a lot of buy pressure at close below 7k
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:04:29
RIP 7k
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:51:59
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:41:27

@_date: 2018-04-30 13:17:15
Well that would be 9.7k. Thats tough
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:03:35
hold 9k for today would be fine and a progress in regard to the last weekends. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:48:50
I was looking at Bitfinex via cryptowatch. But yeah ofc it was 7500 in general
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:33:40

@_date: 2018-04-06 18:22:34
Thanks for your useless thoughts. You shouldve kept quietly. Better flr everyone 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:08:13
Above 9k at this weekend would be a progress and appreciated so we can start the 10k rallye next week with fresh money 
huge fight at 9350 at bitfinex now. if it falls, we might dip a bit

lets break 7k again. 
dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:15:59
No one can advise you. Might drop back but the buy pressure is strong. Longterm.is 9k still a good.opportunity to buy 
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:01:43
how much u lost bro 
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:34:03
Bears really doing Everything to avoid 7k. Those 100 sellwalls at 6995 out of nothing are insane
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:27:27
profit taking, we just passed 9k yesterday. relax 
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:32:37
it bounced off from approx 8600 3 times now. good sign
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:12:52
why would people sell so much at 8k. good news recent days, no fud.
mb it gets better after the future ends at feb,14th
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:15:57
same comments other way around
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:15:15
I think not. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:14:23
Lots of fail attempts to get to 8.5k as next stop. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:42:08
You should google what bulltrap means. This isnt one
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:13:24
The Americans have failed today. So the europeans have.
Lets go asia.
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:34:25
Hodl above 8.2k thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:41:44
So true haha
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:44:23
What do people expect? 500$ every day? Ofc people Close out their positions at the weekend. Lets stay above 8.5k and we will be fine for tje next week. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:11:16
20k is too optimistic. Maybe by tomorrow
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:44:16
its too early for vegeta. too much sellorders triggering when it hits 9k. probably back to 8.7 again now, but hopefully not 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:58:58
fentanyl trader also eat bread
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:33:42
The progress yesterday was too fast and not ,healthy'. Do you expect a $1k jump every day? Just stay calm. It will retest 9.8k again soon
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:12:48
what a great $50 run. TO DA MOON 
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:24:30

@_date: 2018-04-24 11:44:31
True story.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:30:22
Your TAs have always been the shittiest. Do you even want crypto to succeed? Or should it just Disappear?
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:24:28
that was a 100% increase after the 5.9k drop within a week or sth? that wasnt healthy and that was just part of the correction. since that 6.5k movement we experience a steady growth which is good. if we hold the 9k this weekend, were fine
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:11:30
