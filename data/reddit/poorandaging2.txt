how old are you? it took you a paragraph to define investing.
but in doing so you disregarded economic principles.

this is why I can't stand most of the bitcoin audience. conspiracy theorists...

You're speaking for a vocal and paranoid fringe group, not the majority. For people trying to make money, it has to be adopted and liquid. Rational people do not hoard bitcoins and stare at them.

I'm not sure you know what a "target market" is, but you're supposed to narrow it down a liittttttle more than "everyone around the world who has ever used this currency."

It is still not as advantageous as receiving cash or receivables. He needs to take a few accounting courses.
The technological innovation coming to the banking system has the blockchain to thank, but a profitable company will never have reserves of BTC instead of USD.

You mean marketing to bitcoin? If you mean bitcoin to marketing, we'd need to know what type of product/firm you'd be promoting.
If you are a merchant, and you're asking if signaling to your audience that you are able to accept bitcoin as payment, then of course that would expand your market.

This is just where they get their funding from. I see nothing wrong with this. It isn't advocating for or against anything.

nooo haha. start here:  and research the shit out of that. i'm talking read everything more than once. study entrepreneurship and managerial finance. learn practical things, and try and avoid economics. I majored in it but it's far too difficult  for the reward. to start a business, you need to accrue lots of knowledge, not just that of a single asset class. you're years away, but start on the right track and you'll be ahead of everyone in no time.
try your luck with an ecommerce site through shopify or wordpress first. but I still don't know what you're marketing for.

The bitcoin currency is not the focus of this article, nor is it the focus of the forthcoming revolution in banking and finance.
if everyone here was so confident bitcoin will only soar, you'd put your money where your mouth is and buy coins from me at a premium.

scarcity...aggregate demand...finite resources. I'm not going to go into detail, other than to say to LeeWallis: no, not "Or", AND. Empirical research can tell you why. I'm not going to.
My above post makes complete sense if anyone here actually took an intro-level economics course. peace.

" in the long run your bitcoin holdings will (most likely) increase in value."
I'm not even going to get into whether or not I believe that statement, but that is investment advice.

I said exactly that----
12:07 AM
the transaction was posted was considered as a cash advance from the merchant end. 
12:07 AM
according to Circle "If you’d like to know ahead of time if your issuer will charge you a fee, you can call the number on the back of your credit card and ask how they will classify charges from Circle Internet Financial (Merchant Category Code 6051). Some customers have retroactively called their issuer and successfully explained that their deposit with Circle was not a cash advance."
12:07 AM
Circle does not charge cash advances.
12:07 AM
I would suggest you to contact the merchant and check with the information. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:37:11
you implied that in lieu of adding USD to his cash flow he hold onto an asset because it may result in future gains.
"No need to be a dick."
sorry if I sounded like a dick, but I'm trying to make sure a young entrepreneur doesn't crash and burn like the majority of them do. 
I can't believe I'm actually going to say this, but here goes: successful small business are good for the economy as a whole.
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:12:05
that was a hypothetical trade.

Actually, the graph the OP drew is as useful as TA. I still laugh when people attempt TA on real securities, even more so on an instrument like bitcoin (which I love, don't get me wrong). it's at worst pseudoscience and at best a bearable fellow-travel of FA. meaning that dude that you're like, "ok, you can come if you don't talk much."

@_date: 2015-11-05 04:16:32


right. i understand all of that. and yes i know why it has to begin as a loss.
I'm talking huge price movements and a two minute wait for anything positive to happen. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:25:00
I'm just curious: do you think you should be allowed to call yourself a financial adviser? i mean, do you really believe someone could and should trust you with their money?
Instead of saying "You are here" it should say "I am always here."
More likely is that people like yourself are currently, with regards to that model, returning to "normalcy." 
And if those proportions are what you have in mind, then you must think bitcoin soon will be valued at $1500.
To stand by your word would mean to purchase finitely supplied bitcoins from me at well above market value.
To not do so means your post was worthless.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:03:23
I highly recommend you not do this.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:16:26


who is guilty of that crime?
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:52:08
Easy with the "V word." Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

no, the dude that blogged gave financial advice.terrible financial advice going around during an economic recovery had me animated there. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:36:36
listen to me carefully (this will be down-voted by nutties with no finance background) : do not hold bitcoin as another user has suggested. No merchant does that with BTC. Cash flow is the goal of every business.
"for instance why should I be worried about what method the consumer pays me in. why would I want them specifically to pay using the bitcoin method?"
Those are two different questions. giving them more options with which to conduct transactions doesn't necessarily mean you'd prefer one option over the other. You ideally want your customers to give you the most liquid of currencies, so you don't want them specifically to use bitcoin.
Just make it known on your front page/shopping cart that you accept bitcoin as payment. do not offer any incentives for them to use BTC over USD such as discounts. I'm not entirely familiar with the programs out there merchants who accept BTC use to accept payment and then convert it to USD, but it theoretically can't be free, so take that into account.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:45:11
when they're giving financial advice, I do.
" No their fingers don't physically get stuck on the keys.."
