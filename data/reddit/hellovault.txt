Have been wanting to buy an iPod Shuffle or a laptop, looks like I'm going here!

IP can't realistically identify you.

No thanks. I had an HTC One and enjoy the Windows Phone experience more. Although that has nothing to do with the topic because I didn't ask what mobile OS I should go with.

Ah, I didn't think of using a web wallet - that's what this is, not an app to download, right?

Ding ding ding

Since when is a profession generating value = being a valuable member of society?

No, I'm not very well off (neither is my family). I guess my student account is unique in that it gets hit with zero fees.
I was always under the impression that banks earn most of their money from rich clients - being able to make large investments with a large amount of initial capital.

Have had a checking / savings account with them for several years now and besides a SSN mixup at the start, I have had zero issues with them. Haven't paid ANY fees either.

What is a pre-paid credit card

If you make $1 doing something, what you just did is valued at $1. Therefore, what you did is valued.
If they make money, what they are doing for the money is valued.
So, no, you can't.

Regulation is regulation.Regulation can be done by shitty governments and by good governments.

People do it for free, why not get paid?

Uhh, yeah? Ever heard of an orgy? Old concept.

If no one values whores why are they paid? Even more than standard jobs too, according to this source.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:14:04
You just contradicted yourself. If whores are being paid for their work that means their work is valued at whatever amount they are being paid. So you cannot say that whores are not valued.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:10:43
Which is precisely why whores are valued, but not necessarily valued members / contributors to a society.

You are taking money against someone's will. That does not mean that they see value in what you are doing.
When someone voluntarily gives you money in an exchange, it means they see value in doing so.
edit: at this point it's obvious you're trolling but logic is fun.

If I lend someone $100 with 10% flat interest I have just invested $100 for a return of 10%.Edit: redacted, thanks for educating me.
