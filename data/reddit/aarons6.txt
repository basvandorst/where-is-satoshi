how would you work the refunds? lots of things i bought from aliexpress either never came or was broken or not even close to what i ordered.. the site has a guarantee, but if you take the bitcoin and work the deal through them will you refund in bitcoin or credit or ??
@_date: 2016-04-15 01:11:14
1 why didnt you write down your word passphrase? 
2 what happened to the OLD sd card.. the one that probably has your wallet on it.. unless you never had one before, then your wallet MIGHT be on your internal drive.. you just have to copy it to your sd card or take the sd card out and  restart your phone.

"Thank you for even taking the time to read this I'm sure this sub gets a lot of posts from first timers and that's frustrating but as I continue to do research I wanted to post something here specifically for my issues and I look forward to the feedback I get."
um yeah, maybe you should read some of those posts? they have a lot of repeated info.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:04:49
you can buy giftcards with crypto for many stores which you can use online or print out. the nice thing is they dont charge any fees and often have discounts.. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:31:56
yeah im not so sure id be so excited about this.. with the way fees are you are going to lose a third of your salary just with day to day expenses.. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:58:52
you can try a program called recuva.. but its a slim chance the file did not get overwritten. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:12:57
you cant really do anything.. just gotta wait.. there are some 70,000 unconfirmed tx in the mempool.. the fee per KB is like .003-.004.. that ends up being more than you were even spending.. :/
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:16:26
if this was legit id imagine you would use an actual vehicle you have for sale with the invoice clearly in the pic with your name on it as verification.. i wouldn't be too surprised if nobody contacts you to buy one of these cars sight unseen.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:56:46
um, it clearly looks like you send bitcoin to that address. im not sure what your freewallet app says.. but you send from 1CvRv183LThWY9nJ5iaPWMJYKPSehfE4eG to 1FAnNVjBaVtVgzthXPoW42HSz8L422h1aw 85 bitcoin on 11/9
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:57:00
your ledger has multiple addresses based on the same seed key. there are recieving addresses, and there are change addresses. when you send bitcoin, the ledger actually sends all of the bitcoin you have in one tx out of that address. it then splits that and the part going to your friend goes to his address, and the remainder goes back to you into a change address.. the old address is still valid tho.. dont worry if someone sends you bitcoin to it, it will show up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:55:28
so it had to have been someone you dealt with before.. its almost impossible to guess a used bitcoin address.. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:18:23
nothing that address only has 1.22414471 BTC so it would only have the same amount of bch.
im guessing this one might be yours too? 1LhWjhkLY6dyrqSAFfuzY5PBBnPRwft6Z5
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:46:28
id say he didn't have the funds and he is backing out. sounds like he maybe hoped you would release the escrow without proper payment and when you called him out he was like oh well ok bye.. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:59:57
i beg to differ.. miners mining for ethereum are probably the ones buying all the gpus and i guarantee they are doing it with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:12:28
electrum is safe.. make sure you only download it from the actual site, electrum.org and verify the signature.
also make sure you write the seed down and encrypt the wallet with a really strong password you dont forget.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:56:16
while they might not be able to be able to prove what you spent bitcoin on, if you bought x amount of bitcoin from coinbase or whatever and coinbase sent it in. they could audit you to make sure you still have x amount of bitcoin and if you dont you would certainly have to pay taxes on cashing it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:32:49
sending it back to the senders address should be ok.. there is really no way to send bitcoin without the private keys to that address to sign the transaction, so they will just get them back to resend again.. it's crazy tho someone would mess up and accidentally send to another wallet that isn't unused.. that is like 1 in a million. unless this person has sent you bitcoin before and had you saved
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:43:37
larger companies like boeing, apple and ms buy their own stocks back at a certain price, it may be under market price but this price is what they value them at.. unlike bitcoin that has no value, its traded at whatever someone is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:53:49
i think they need to fork in a FIFO type confirmation system and do away with dynamic fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:17:34
nope.. im guessing your wallet has a bunch of small transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:50:01
i still dont think its going to be an issue.. 10 years from now miners will be so advanced they will only use a few watts and even 1.6 bitcoin would be enough to make a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:12:28
if your wallet wasn't encrypted just open the wallet.dat with notepad or something and copy your private key into electrum, if it was encrypted you can still import the wallet.dat in bitcoin core if you remember the password.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:37:58
before you sent them back you should have looked into signing the transaction with a small note.. altho if i accidently sent 800$ and you sent it back, id send some for a thanks lol.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:31:46
at that point you should add the new seed to the paper and put that in the safety box
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:51:45
yes in the options.. you can set it anything you want.. but you might not get your transaction confirmed if you set it too low.. unfortunately unless they do away with dynamic fees and put in some kind of FIFO system this will only get worse..
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:50:25
your problem is you are spending the outputs that have not confirmed.. so no matter what they won't confirm until the first one does.. basically at this point you are just throwing away bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:47:28
um, in the US if you buy something with bitcoin like goods or services it is like you are cashing out your bitcoin for cash value of said goods and you certainly do have to pay gains taxes on it in a first in first out basis.. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:34:35
the bip39 wordlist has some 2048 english words standard that can be in any order and even repeated, some wallets add to this.. the trezor has over 4000. so if someone got 6 of the words with no way of knowing what order they are, first 6 or last 6, it could take a very long time for them to guess the other 6. altho with a script its not impossible.. so dont count on it being safe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:44:32
unfortunately if his friend is just some random guy he can charge whatever he wants.. unless there is some pre done up contract from a lawyer saying the bitcoin is your father's, he might not even have to give them back.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:12:53
i didnt know there was a correct way to use bitcoin lol.. 
please enlighten me on how to use bitcoin properly and buy things online with it in the 15 minutes bitpay lets you complete a transaction without spending a fortune on fees.. im really starting to think that everyone that is ok with the current fee system never really uses bitcoin and just holds.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:08:43
its safe to post the bitcoin address so someone can tell you how much bitcoin is in there. the private key should be 51 chars starting with 5. if it is encrypted it will start with 6P and need to be decrypted to import. do not tell anyone your private key.. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:20:43
im sure mac has some notepad app
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:05:51
I guess? You could also get bit by shark while driving to work. The odds are probably better for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:55:39
its default is 14 days.. if you NEED to spend bitcoin 5$ at a time, i dont think bitcoin is for you. you should see if whatever you are spending this on takes litecoin or doge.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:31:44
um how so.. you dont believe that computer science is going to get to the point where a tiny sha256 asic wont take much power and still produce a lot of hash rate? seriously tho, once the block reward halves down to where its not profitable for huge mining farms to be sustained you wont need much power to solo mine and still earn a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:58:31
actually i have boeing stock and they mail me about every 3 months asking if i want to sell it back to them.. they even offer deals that is for more than asking price.. of course they also let me know about every year i can double down and get more for their asking price.. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:58:46
your wallet should have given you a "master" seed that when inserted it will recover ALL the change addresses as well as any used and unused address.. this is how HD wallets work.. also any time you import a paper wallet, you should sweep it.. not just import the private key
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:41:06
you can mine bitcoin-gold or ethereum-classic.. do some research on those coins and see if you would be profitable based on your power costs. if you want bitcoin you can use a pool like miningpoolhub that auto converts said coins for you into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:02:46
unfortunately most pools, like zpool have cranked up the min difficulty so high that the antminer s3 no longer submits a share until it times out. this is why its beeping and showing the pool as dead. you are going to have to find an alt coin to mine with it.. maybe peercoin? and the best firmware is the one kano did for these.. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:25:33
i agree.. a couple years ago bitcoin was great.. you could get some and shop online and not worry about companies stealing your credit info.. places were really starting to come on board like overstock, newegg and tigerdirect and there was several sites that accepted bitcoin. but now most of the smaller sites have all shut down or have such huge markups, or you have to send such a huge fee to get confirmed in the 15 minutes they give you.. about the only site that you can really use bitcoin is purse to buy things on amazon and thats if you keep a fair amount in their wallet.. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:14:15
im guessing your funds arent lost and will just take awhile.. the support said a few times this is automated and wont be completed instantly.. you probably made it worse asking for a refund..

oh i don't know how localbitcoins account works.. can you send to a username? perhaps it's the same username with extra numbers at the end.. lol.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:05:24
if you have the private key, and your bitcoin shows up in the public key on an online search, i would not worry about it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:08:04
yeah i dunno, this app seems really fishy.. they are proud not to supply you with your seed or private keys because the app is so secure you dont need them.. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:21:18
post the tx id
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:29:46
a fee based priority system is flawed in exactly this way.. the only real fix is to impose a first in first out system.. this will not fix the speediness of confirmations, but it will at least guarantee your tx wont get rejected because the fee went up after you sent it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:18:57
just import all the keys in electrum. i think you can do them all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:28:36
i think this guy is slow.. if he has his paper wallet with the key printed on it. why does he need some software to help him restore it.. you just sweep the private key he has and import all his bitcoin in a HD wallet.. if he wants he can keep the paper with the old key or throw it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:03:31
they probably won't expire.. sooner or later the mempool will get caught up and they will all go through.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:36:15
you cant compare bitcoin which has no real world usage to stocks or even real currency.. stocks have value because the company they belong to turns a profit.. while i dont believe bitcoin is a scheme.. it really has no intrinsic value.. the price is only what people are buying it at.. when they stop, it goes to zero and you have nothing.. unlike apple and ms stocks, which they set the value they will buy them back for.. unfortunately with the fees and the fact it takes days to confirm a tx.. bitcoin is unreliable and is not going to make it as currency unless they change something. right now its only worth holding in the hopes that enough people fight for buying it that the value goes up.. the truth hurts, but you cant deny it. i love the fact that bitcoin was meant to be an irreversible payment method that was nearly anonymous.. i really hope they do something with the fees so it works at that.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:31:28
these scripts already exist.. the thing is tho there are so many different keys that the thought of 2 people finding the same one is impossible.. about this many 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 or about twice as much as all the grains of sand on every beach in the world added up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:05:13
ok, so this parking address.. is it an exchange? you need to contact them.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:49:11
no, what he said wont work. you have to send the first tx with rbf enabled.. if he sends bitcoin to himself right now, it wont confirm until the first one does and he will just be wasting bitcoin on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:20:57
i used to use bitcoin everyday.. its what it was designed for.. i love the fact you can buy something online in a one time transaction that you arent giving your credit card info away for them to hold onto forever and possibly get hacked and it stolen. unfortunately with this civil war type thing they got going on with the block size and fees its not useful anymore..
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:51:10
what's the usage? its meant to be a irreversible payment method that is semi anonymous.. but right now i buy something online for 35$ i have to pay 30$ in fee to transmit the tx and wait 3 days for it to go through... the only thing bitcoin is good for is holding and hoping you get rich.. just look at ALL of the posts.. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:36:56
not sure how Australian taxes work. but in the us this would be a dumb idea.. as when tax time comes around you have to add up all of those transactions and get taxed for them as gains.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:31:39
yeah.. i think people are going to need a tad bit of proof you are legit before forking over .05 bitcoin to some random wallet.. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:10:29
you mean 100 years from now?? i really dont think that is going to be an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:35:46
id say that most of the people mining bitcoin, or any altcoin for that matter uses it at some point to buy something.. id speculate the % is high.. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:53:13
actually by that example it looks more like march. he is assuming there will be no drops.. which there probably will be.
@_date: 2015-12-21 07:46:01
whats sad is it would probably drop to 3 or less if china pools would stop mining empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:27:12
it is sad that bitcoin.com something that anyone that is new would search for and check out.. doesn't even fully support bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:02:19
im not 100% sure that works.. but in the last few days OP has sent 6 transactions and none of them had enough fee, including the one OP just sent.. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 06:12:36
your sarcasm is deep.. yet. if the china pools didnt mine empty blocks people wouldnt have to wait so long for transactions to be confirmed.. 
even transactions that have high fees get passed over by china pools.. so basically they are hurting everyone.
@_date: 2015-12-13 06:11:15
wait what? zero-transaction blocks are in no way good for bitcoin. it doesnt do anything for bitcoin but generate new coins.. you know how bitcoin works right?? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:16:28
what? if you use a wallet like electrum you can see every key for every address it generates, plus your master seed.. so you can restore them all.. not sure what you are going on about not having your keys.
@_date: 2015-12-12 10:35:50
if you want faster confirmations you need to spread the word to stop mining on china pools, as they mine zero transaction blocks.
today alone, enough empty blocks went through to catch up the backlog of transactions.. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:29:33
unfortunately you cant. the whole fee system is broken and it needs to be reworked.
@_date: 2015-12-12 10:48:24
the only real fix is to spread the word about china pools mining empty blocks.. 
enough blocks were mined today that were empty to fill the back order and catch up the transactions..
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:35:49
if he upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10, his wallet file might be in the windows.old folder. if he didnt delete it, it should still be ok.. just import it into bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:27:42
steam stopped accepting bitcoin for this very reason.. i wouldn't be surprised other sites do the same at some point.. buying something on newegg with bitcoin is a hassle... you have to let bitpay time out, then email them with your tx id.. then wait for them to credit your account.. and if the prices changed you have to pay extra as they dont hold the price.. or it could go out of stock.. unless you just throw the 50$ fee on it so it gets confirmed in the next block :/ plus there is the fact the us government is cracking down on taxes.. so if you use coinbase or whatever and they send you a 1099 and you must pay 35% in taxes on whatever you spent, because buying something with bitcoin is considered a cashed out event.. on top of the property gains tax for profit.. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:08:52
id say its likely the people that buy bitcoin hold it, and the ones that mine sell it.. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 09:01:24
you have to go back and find the unconfirmed input and see whats going on.. most likely you just have to wait.. it probably was sent with too low fee.. 
you can try to put the tx into here
@_date: 2017-02-13 09:22:45
post the tx id
@_date: 2017-02-13 09:42:18
yeah its going to be awhile. i put the tx in the viabtc site so as soon as that pool gets a block it will confirm.
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:17:27
then he would have 420 coins 210 original bitcoin and 210 worthless alternate? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:59:03
48 hours and it will fail.. but it may get rebroadcasted and start over automatically. 
do you have the tx id?
@_date: 2016-03-27 11:08:09
LBC has an escrow option.. but paypal ALWAYS sides with the buyer on charge backs.. so if the person who sends you money isnt honest, uses a stolen card, or just says he didnt get whatever he bought, you lost your money and bitcoins. using paypal is very risky.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:29:03
its not spam, gone are the days you can send bitcoin with a .0001 fee.. its reality.. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:21:20
Fee per byte	24.51 sat/B
not enough fee.. going to take awhile.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:38:41
nope.. you can try to use this but its been pretty busy.
and next time dont ignore the suggestion that wallet gives you for a fee.. its suggesting 220 sat/byte. almost 10x more than you gave it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:22:41
+1 for purse. ive also had friends use this site and not have any problems.. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:53:50


main website
they have a paid version, but its exactly the same software but with support.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:17:38
.0001 fee is NOT enough now days.. it may never confirm. 
ive had one tx go for 7 days without confirming, it failed 4 times and on the 4th time it finally went through.
the good news is blocktrail sees it
so this means its on the network. it will eventually go through.
@_date: 2016-01-24 03:04:46
this is the exact opposite that is needed.. for bitcoin to thrive it needs to be looked at as its own currency and not be tied to any fiat value.
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:42:59
watching the video it almost sounds like he doesnt even know what bitcoin is and he is just answering the question trying to be smart.. its "interesting", but him saying its better than currency because you don't have to physically be present exchange it makes him sound like he has never used a bank or paypal or venmo or any other forms of sending money to someone.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:30:26
i dont think you understand how it works.
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:17:51
it sucks, but right now there are almost 100,000 unconfirmed transactions.. your fee was much too low at .0005/kb. the optimal fee right now is almost 3x that.. there really isnt much you can do but wait.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:29:39
it could be a couple days. with only a .0001 fee it might not even confirm at all and get rejected.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:48:43
YES.. but it might not work 100%..
try a FREE program called recuva and have it search for .dat file.
altho sometimes when you format a drive the file names are lost.. so if it cant find the .dat file you can try to just recover all the files on the drive. it might take a couple days.
DO NOT INSTALL ANYTHING ON THAT DRIVE.. it will greatly reduce the chance of finding the wallet.dat file, also how you pc got reformatted, if you used the f9 option to reset you may have a folder called windows.old this will have your old files in it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 07:51:23
i personally think mining pools are hurting bitcoin.
mining pools allow entities much larger than what would happen if everyone mined solo. it also promotes leeching of miners that do not have enough hash to ever find a block.
@_date: 2019-11-21 08:44:24
um, picture this..
you hare a huge mining farm.. 1000s of miners.. and you are mining on fill in some pool..
you get 10 of the 15 blocks found per hour..
now say, 1 or 2 BTC of each block gets distributed to lesser miners, most on obsolete machines like S7's because they have free power.
is that not leeching?? a S7 will never find a block.. altho im betting a large amount of them are still hashing away.
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:06:49
i feel it would be the other way around, the large mining farms wouldnt risk the investment and the home miner that just got 1 or 2 machines running in the basement would be what is the norm.
@_date: 2019-11-21 09:15:48
if the miner never finds a block, his hash is useless as far as the pool goes..
@_date: 2019-11-21 09:13:10
this solidifies my statement. 
without mining pools you wouldn't need huge farms and huge investments.. yes you could still if you can afford but like you said many wouldnt put up the investment for a one time payout months away.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:59:45
yes this is how bitcoin works.. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:08:57
several years ago all you had was usb and gpu mining.. :/
those miners are useless today and most pools will ban your ip if you try to connect them.
not all hash is valid.. hash that cant ever make any blocks is leeching the pool.
if you were running a pool and it had mostly s17s on it, and a few s5s connect.. you would probably ban them.
@_date: 2016-06-07 02:06:24
you said cold storage.. explain exactly what you have..
is it a paper wallet with a bar code?
@_date: 2019-11-21 09:46:40
exactly.. then you end up with 2/3rds of the network centralized by one giant mining firm that could, even by accident, take out the entire bitcoin network..
its happened before.. one of the pools went offline for a few hours and bitcoin didnt get a block the entire time. that was a couple years ago.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:33:28
the only way bitcoin paper money would work is if they didnt have the private key.. that way there is no way to spend the bitcoin online. this would keep the value of the paper money offline.
@_date: 2016-06-07 03:48:59
where did you get the seed from? and how did you get the address watch only in electrum. 
i dont think you are telling the whole story.
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:30:36
you can very easily.. in the settings under address you can sign a message using ANY of the address you previously used.. just pick the one you used for this TX
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:13:53
um i think you are confused with what this antrouter is.. 
it has nothing to do with video cards, or power.
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:48:04
no the sending wallet has 2 inputs.. 
here let me help you
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:42:37
i sent some bitcoin yesterday with a .0002 fee, total and it went through in the next block.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:08:38
did you try to open it in notepad? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:09:05
i dont believe it.. only 14,000 tx in mempool.. if you sent it with any fee at all it will go through in 2 to 5 blocks. .0002 K/b should have been sufficient.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:29:04
looks right to me..
4.99950467 + 0.36938107 = 5.36888574
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:56:42
there is no reason, with less than 10,000 unconfirmed tx's in the mempool you can send bitcoin right now with a .0001 fee and get in the next block or two.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:06:03
i dont see why anyone still mines on this pool.. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:34:23
sorry i meant sha-256d.. which bitcoin uses.. but even all forms of sha-2 is not secure for passwords.. you can use gpus to crack the hashes quickly enough.. ill edit my post.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:41:40
maybe its a eu thing but i dont share my list, i just view it and copy the url? 
edit i see what you are saying, you hit the email list button? yeah dont do that.. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:18:19
not really i like that game and they just added a bunch of new stuff.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:25:40
my wishlist url is what it always was. you sure its set to public and the use 3rd party box is checked?
@_date: 2016-11-22 11:53:00
this has actually happened to me twice.. i received funds and they did not add a fee, or a too small fee.. it goes about 4 or 5 days then disappears.. unfortunately its up to the sender to send it again. it is a huge flaw in the bitcoin system as a seller cant know for certain a tx will go through until it does.. and most of the time its impossible to wait around for hours until it does.. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:11:53
it sounds great but these new solar and wind farms probably wont change you energy sector or make your power cheaper.. as these farms will be private and just used for mining equipment. bitcoin right now is in the "gold rush" phase and like the real gold rush back in history it will collapse the same way once the technology catches up and its no longer profitable to have a huge mining farm.
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:52:42
except its not a currency and in the US its taxed as property.. until this changes it will never be officially adopted. why use bitcoin and pay extra in taxes if you can just use paypal, or venmo, or all the other payment methods online.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:58:01
you cant think of it as how much i would have now if i saved, you think of it as how much did i spend at the time.. i too have spent bitcoin early on where now it would have been worth a huge amount.. but at the time i was mining them for mostly free.. so even tho they are worth more now, i still got a good deal buying what i did.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:16:52
that and actually holding coins does absolutely nothing for the tech. 
@_date: 2019-08-23 05:05:53
the address doesnt matter, the hash160 key would be the same.. 
say you accidently sent bitcoin to a ltc address.
you would just use the hash160 key for your ltc address to generate you a new bitcoin address.. then you generate a new tx with that key to send your coins back.
as far as the segwit. i havent tested it but i found this

@_date: 2019-08-25 02:46:33
i hate to be that guy but this is why bitcoin in its current form will never go mainstream as a currency..
for anyone reading this.. NEVER KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEY UNENCRYPTED.. 
use a secure password generator, and check all of the boxes.. 
had OPS private key been encrypted with a good password, even if it was taken by malware or hacked, it would have been useless.
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:20:29
im fairly certain every one of these questions is answered on their website.
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:19:41
unfortunately i have an unconfirmed tx in the system right now, it will probably fail.. i use electrum, and i checked the let the server decide the fee, and it chose .000115ish/kb.. total fee was .0003.. its stuck on low priority.. my order from newegg was already canceled.. sigh.. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:24:00
its ok, when you spend bitcoin you have to spend the entire amount of the input.. so say you have .04 and you want to send someone .02, .02 minus the fee will come back to you.. some wallets use change addresses, so each address is used one time and the change gets sent to another address.. then what happens is when you spend bitcoin from those addresses, the wallet will pick from them close to the actual amount.. its not uncommon to have small amounts of bitcoin in several addresses in your wallet. the change ones are usually hidden.
@_date: 2019-08-23 03:04:09
you can do it with pretty much any coins.. like LTC..
if you "accidentally" send bitcoin to a LTC address. you can use the LTC private key to send the bitcoin back.
as far as getting bch from old addresses.. you still can but only if it had coins before the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:32:14
i think this has been talked about before.. specially since the block rewards have already hit 12.5
anyway sha-2 is NOT sha256d.. you cant use bitcoin hardware to crack sha-2 passwords. 
also since sha256d miners just check the nonce to see if its above the target value (based on bitcoin difficulty), there is more than one possibility of a correct hash solution. basically the first miner to get the target threshold wins.. it doesnt actually calculate anything useful.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:49:40
like i said, just copy the url.. it looks like this for me 
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:54:15
id say that all alts are scams as they are completely unneeded and dont offer anything different to what bitcoin offers.
there is no reason some alt coin is better than another alt coin.. its all hype.
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:31:33
yeah, its all good.. they will get the tx eventually and ill get a credit. 
edit.. seems i picked a bad day to try to buy something online with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-23 04:09:08
thats not the point tho.. bitcoin is dominant because its original.. 
you cant say that bch or any other alt coin is better than bitcoin.. because they are not.. they are basically unneeded.
@_date: 2019-08-23 04:28:18
the devs did add a way to recover bitcoin send to a bch segwit address.. as long as you have the bch private key.
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:50:15
how is the tech winning? bitcoin and bitcoin cash has really no difference in usage..
bitcoin was meant to be a semi anonymous payment method that was secure enough to not have to worry about charge backs. 
it was never meant to be a store of value or a get rich holding type of investment. the fact that is it sort of hurts its purpose.
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:44:00
its not gone.. every bitcoin address can be used to get bch as well with the same private keys.
but yeah, this should be illegal and investigated by the ftc or something.
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:05:23
LPT: ALWAYS, and i do mean ALWAYS EVERY SINGLE TIME.. enable 2fa ( even on your gmail, exchanges, pools, and webforums ).. and refuse to store your bitcoin in exchanges.. its best to put them in an encrypted wallet like electrum, and then back up this wallet to somewhere secure.
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:12:50
if its wallet.dat you can just use bitcoin-qt
you will have to put it in the /appdata/roaming/bitcoin folder once its made.. then restart the program.
@_date: 2019-08-23 03:19:18
its not really possible to send bitcoin to any other addresses as the core wallet will reject it.. but if you did somehow the way the private keys work they are all the same and interchangeable. obviously not for like ethereum.. just coins based on the core wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:30:36
that doesnt show you what your balance is tho.. im guessing on the 15th someone guessed your password and sent your balance to this address. if you didnt do it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:57:16
i'm fairly certain you can run the program, go into file and export the wallet? you can probably import the wallet the same way which should open the correct folder.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:47:28
something doesnt add up.. you claim to have had 0.00275BTC but your wallet you list had 0.00360000 deposited into it and send to 2 addresses.. which was then spent
 and the change sent here 
also the 2 tx links are outputs not inputs.. to this address 1DVhaBdbp5mx5Y8zR1qR9NBiQtrgL9ZNQs 
id definitely email them and see whats up.. you might have gotten hacked.. do you have 2fa enabled?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:50:29
a gpu will not be fast enough to produce any usable shares.. it basically ddos' the pool.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:52:19
not really.. no pools accept shares from a gpu/cpu.. they will all be stale or low diff shares that are useless.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:59
there is a problem tho. if everyone holds and nobody sells, then bitcoin actually loses value. also bitcoin was meant to be an anonymous way to buy something that was chargeback free.. if it costs too much to send, its not worth anything, even as a store of value.. lets face it, gold has a value because its tangible and in the end people use it to make jewelry and other uses it has.. not just because it's gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:54:21
im pretty sure they are overcharging fees to keep people from complaining about "losing" bitcoin when they really didn't and its just taking awhile for it to confirm.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:51:35
bitcoin.com is certainly not a scam site.. even if they support bitcoin cash they are legit wallet..
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:42:12
you could contact kraken support if they have access to the bitcoin cash private keys they might be able to send your coins back to you.. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:51:49
did you have 2fa enabled?
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:15:57
this address
 and this one
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:00:23
ALWAYS enable 2fa if its offered.. 
ALWAYS write down your random seed phrase when installing a new wallet.
NEVER use the same password for different sites.. if you can NEVER use the same email either. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:43:49
its not lost.. it will eventually go through. since you used a low fee it will take awhile.. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:02:36
it is tho, the one i listed is a tx from oct 1. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:34:52
im assuming you didnt save the 2fa hard codes? in your google account under settings should have some hard codes.. those might work.. if not do you still have access to your old phone? unfortunately if not the only real way is to reset with seed as your wallet is password protected with the 2fa.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:51:05
put that gpu on nicehash to mine zcash or something, it will make enough to actually pay for itself.
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:24:56
do you really think that bitcoin has a future if its too expensive to mine and only a few people that have free electricity or whatever are the only ones left to mine it?
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:25:46
its not exactly true tho.. in  his example if you start with $100 CASH and trade it for something say a painting that is worth $150 you only need to pay taxes if you sell that painting.. if a few years later, your painting isnt worth $150 anymore, then you dont have to worry about it..
with bitcoin, as soon as you trade it for something, the market value at that time is taxed.. even if what you bought isnt worth $150.. the market value of the bitcoin is taxed, not the value of what you bought.
this makes bitcoin not a currency, but property. its like trading something with something else.. not using money.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:14:43
i think the app is a standalone wallet, so yeah unless someone got your phone or you downloaded a phishing app or clicked a phishing email it should be ok.. id email their support.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:42
yep no way to really fix this.. even putting POS mining in wouldn't fix this as only the very few with a lot of coins would be getting anything on stake.
@_date: 2019-12-21 11:16:14
unless there are some huge advancements in bitcoin mining hardware i really dont expect this halving to be very popular.
look at litecoin, no advancements in hardware meant the halving made everything you had to mine with virtually obsolete overnight.
bitcoin isnt doing so great in terms of mining hardware.. its expensive, it uses a lot of power and it needs industry to run. unless they come out with some home miner that can be ran on 110v and doesnt use a million watts of electricity bitcoin doesnt have much of a future. it might not be this halving, but the next one surely will kill all profits from mining. you need miners to make bitcoin work and there is absolutely no way bitcoin mining can be sustained on tx fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:50:47
yeah, id ask them but i wouldnt count on it.. how would they know you are who is owning that address.. you could have just picked one and said thats mine can you change it lol.. i guess its a good lesson.. dont mine on a wallet from an exchange.. i think it even says that on nicehash.
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:07:49
there is no way to really know. its all a complete guess.. 
currently tho there isnt a lot of unconfirmed txs but that could change.. i look here  it says at the min .0002 /Kb. id probably go .0005 unless you absolutely need it in the next block.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:47:47
LOL btc.com gave me .005 for signing up, its worth $52 
i forgot all about it and just checked.. still there.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:46:50
post those and it would be a good start to see what pool mined it.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:43:04
not sure how you are mining bitcoin with a gpu.. most pools wont accept any shares from one.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:25:45
LOL who charges for haircuts buy the minute? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:34:09
when you install any wallet on your phone it makes you write down a few random words and type them back in before it allows you to continue.. using these words you can reinstall that app on your new phone.

@_date: 2016-02-13 10:18:06
i used this and the last time i sent bitcoin it was pretty accurate
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:17:34
sometimes it can take much longer.. an hour? two? 
and if you are buying tokens in advance, why even use bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:11:12
bitcoin was never meant to be held as an investment.. id love to see this coin go down to 1$ each so it can hit mainstream adoption and actually be used as a currency. its purpose was a semi anonymous payment method that was impossible to charge back.. until it hits a reasonable price it will never be useful as that.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:14:31
i love to see more places accepting bitcoin, but until its taxed differently its not a wise choice to use as a currency.
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:52:57
if you plan on selling the BCH. DO NOT!!! put your private key in any web sites.. its a known scam to get ones key then transfer off the bitcoin. since they use the same key.. 
the proper way is to transfer your bitcoin to a NEW wallet.. not just a new ADDRESS.. then put the key to the old wallet in the BCH client. then transfer that to exchange to get funds or whatever you want to do with it.
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:45:44
crypto is not safe tho.. it can and most likely will drop to zero value when something new and improved comes out. you can also be hacked and or lose your password and make your funds inaccessible.
people that refuse to spend bitcoin because it might be worth more later are actually doing more harm then good.
bitcoins actual sole purpose was something that is a semi anonymous payment method that is immune to charge backs.
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:40:56
its not really KYC and criminal uses, its the fact that some site somewhere has to have all your documents on file that you have no way of knowing how its used.
there are already been hacks and information leaked.. it will only get worse.
the fact that bitcoin was created so you dont have to give sites the info they can leak and use against you makes bitcoin useless with KYC and no better than just using credit cards.
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:01:41
you realize they are paying people back with their own fees.. its not honorable at all.
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:26:38
right, but you really think that any business is going to handle your info correctly? look at all the data breaches that happen now.. KYC is a ticking time bomb, and you can guarantee your data is going to be sold eventually. data that those sites dont really need.
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:14:59
unless he is running his own node the IP is going to be whatever node broadcasted the tx and the pool that confirmed it.. i would be more careful about what site you are using to pay for the bitcoin. as today its common for them to ask for very personal info, who knows if they are storing it correctly or disposing it like they should be once you are verified.
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:09:42
ok but they are saying they will fully reimburse everyone that lost funds. yet they forced you to mine on their site possibly at a loss, paying their fee, which was like 3% on mining and 4% on withdraws, now its 3% and 5%.. and every  month they will "pay you back" like 1% of your balance once you hit the payout..
so yeah, they are making money off YOU mining through them because its easy for you and paying you back with your own funds... not honorable at all.
which btw i stopped mining there, and they still owe me bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:05:45
LOL dont fall for this.. noway to know what this file is and if you buy it and its legit you still have ZERO chance of guessing the password.
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:13:37
since its a large amount you can try calling the fbi?
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:08:17
if bitcoin doubles (12,200$) and you buy 10$ every week for 3 years plus your initial 25$ you can expect to have 362$ worth of bitcoin.. minus the coinbase fees.. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:14:34
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:43:54
yes it seems so.. but it looks like a huge scam.. there is no replay protection so if you put your private keys in a bitcoin gold wallet, they can spend your real bitcoin without you knowing. also they premined 100,000 coins before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:57:57
there is none, the admins on that site do not have access to the password 
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:43:00
there is no reason to use these macs to mine bitcoin.. its pointless. 
monero maybe.. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:49:45
it doesnt look like it's mentioned here.. you already can buy things on amazon with bitcoin through a site called purse.io
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:36:45
i guess anything is possible, but coinbase did give their customers bitcoin cash after the last fork.. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:05:10
just be careful thats a lot of money to throw around without knowing what you are doing.. i've seen lots of posts where someone goes out and buys bitcoin because it's trendy and then from someone's advice, loses it.. 
electrum is good. just make sure you write down the encryption seed so you dont lose your coins should your pc go bad.. or something.. 
also +1 on a hardware wallet, like trenzor or ledger nano. they also have seeds you write down so you can replace the device with your coins should you lose it.. anyways once you have your private keys no matter what way the fork goes.. your bitcoin should be safe.
also this fork that is coming up should be hard fork.. so there won't be two coins like the last one since they are coding the core to ignore the old fork.
@_date: 2019-09-04 05:05:31
they arent tracking small change like a few dollars.. 
now take $100,000 and try that.. you probably wouldn't make it out of the desert without black helicopters and vans following you.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:16:25
if you have to ask all these questions it might be best to keep your coins on coinbase.. they are insured.. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:17:27
its only a small amount.. just hold onto it.. make sure you dont lose the private key.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:03:45
except the gov is already coming for it.. by taxing the shit out of you for owning it.. 2017 was a good year for the us tax man.. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 05:05:50
you control the bitcoin tho and you shouldnt release it until the item arrives.. so really no you cant be scammed.. 
ive had some orders canceled once picked up.. probably whomever bought the items credit card was declined or something and it wasnt shipped.. 
after a couple days, it will go back to waiting for buyer and someone else can buy it.
oh and purse really isnt about FAST.. it could take a few days to get an item if you put a huge discount on it.. people arent going to pay for overnight if they dont have to.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:33:39
since Bitcoin Core 0.12 there actually is an expiration in the mempool, which evicts unconfirmed transactions after N hours, where N is set by -mempoolexpiry, and defaults to 72 hours.
unfortunately sites like blockchain.info may rebroadcast the tx automatically.. thus keeping it alive forever.. 
the advice i gave him should stop that.. so he can respend the coins.
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:55:21
im guessing it was the token for the confirmation. 
the emails i got was request password reset, request withdraw and successful withdraw.. 
the thing is tho they DIDNT change my password.. i have 2fa enabled.. this might have prevented that.
i did log in.. and check my balance it was 0.00$ and i DID contact support on their chat panel. the one on the right.
and i did change the password myself.. just in case. then the site went offline.
although now my account is locked. it says error when i try to log in and i cant request a password change because it doesnt recognize my email.
i did contact support.. they probably wont get back to me tho until tuesday :(
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:38:29
looks like its all confirmed?
@_date: 2016-05-01 19:01:58
oh ok.. :/
at the block reward halving, 75% of all bitcoins will have been mined.. currently there are 15.5 million out of the 21 million coins mined.. right now we are at about 73.8%
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:10:11
this will probably never confirm and after ~~72 hours~~ i guess its 336 hours now get deleted from the mempool.. unfortunately there is nothing you can do. next time use a better wallet that wont let you make such a mistake.
i guess with the new core client since .13 you can right click the tx and choose abandon and possibly respend the coins.. 
i just did a quick google search to find that info.. cant guarantee.
i suggest moving to electrum client to spend bitcoin. if the fee is too low it will first complain, then give you an option to add a replace by fee option to your tx.. this way you can spend up the change to make the fee higher, if you need to later.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:02:50
you dont have to be anywhere near a computer to receive bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 08:31:05
you are assuming that the dumping of new coins is what is keeping the price down. 
there is only going to be 1800 new coins daily. the market already has 15.5 million coins on it.. 
even if the miners HOLD all the daily coins and not spend them. the price will not be influenced. even if they choose to put them on the market at higher rates, there will be many who already have a large horde of coins that will sell them cheaper.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:10:19
Fee / KB	0.00050029 BTC
Optimal Fee / Kb   0.00198730 BTC
your fee is not high enough for a fast confirmation. there is really nothing you can do but wait it out.
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:23:55
yeah i was actually logged in at the time i got the email saying i requested to change my password and withdraw funds.. 
i was giving someone feedback from a package i received earlier.
literally the 2 emails were back to back 2:40PM and 2:41PM, then i received a 3rd email saying my funds were short on my order that i had.
that is when i opened a chat with support. straight from the webpage. i also changed my password and turned off and back on 2fa to make sure it wasnt changed. google authenticator tho gave up the right code so it wasnt.
maybe since i changed my password directly it kept them from changing it. who knows.. i was quick to notice.
i dunno i might have been one of the firsts to catch it and they pulled the plug so they didnt lose anyone elses bitcoin.
altho right now i cant log into purse.. my password nor my email works. :(
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:29:20
id say no not really.. there are too many coins in the market than what gets made by mining.. even if all mining stopped right now there would be enough coins bought and sold to keep the price up.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:38:21
thats a moot point and its not really relevant.. you get the idea.
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:26:13
yeah but im fairly certain there are more bitcoins for sale today then they are mined.. and when the halving there will be even more.
@_date: 2015-10-26 06:57:51
when i first got my s3s they made around 25$ a day in bitcoin each.. but bitcoin was around 600$ then. unfortunately it didnt last long, difficulty went up fast and bitcoin value dropped just as fast.
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:37:09
you said you sent with high fee, yet your fee is less than the lowest recommended and HALF what it would have taken to get a fast confirmation.
its going to take awhile.. no your coins are not lost.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:50:20
no offense but um, anything you have to pay in advance to get MORE money back in return is a ponzi scam.. and yes you will surely ALWAYS get your initial trial investment back, to show you how it works, but they will ALMOST ALWAYS take your double down and disappear.. its how it works
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:59:55
yes they have access to all of the private keys.. yes they can get them.. no they cant use them without YOUR password because they are encrypted.. and NO they dont know YOUR password.. even if they access your account the keys are still encrypted.. i think that blockchain.info is pretty secure.. they even have an option to double encrypt your wallet.. meaning you have a login password and a separate usage password.. they also have 2fa.. which should be enabled at all times..
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:13:01
im fairly certain your password is NOT stored plaintext on their site.. its more then likely salted and unique to your identifier.. to be honest id trust a site that has 2fa and double password over my own pc that some family member can download a virus on without you knowing.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:12:38
WHY??? the mempool is so low less than 15,000 tx's you could have gotten away with .0001
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:39:09

it really is common sense, why would they sell it to you so you can profit from it instead of just mining themselves and profiting.

you sure? most mobile android wallets are not full wallets.. did you write down your seed words? also if the device reset, it most likely didnt wipe your internal drive.. so the wallet files still could be there, somewhere.

says it doesn't exist.. must have been rejected..
EDIT.. it has 2 unconfirmed inputs.. those have to be confirmed first..
unfortunately one has 0 fee and the other is very low.. the 0 fee one will never confirm.. so the tx is stuck until it gets rejected after 2 weeks.. hopefully whomever sent you that .001 btc is trustworthy enough to send it again with a proper fee this time, unfortunately the fee will be higher than the payment.. so probably not lol

make sure you have unlimited internet, and not fake unlimited.. running a node will eat through the data.. i ran one for awhile until comcast called me and wanted me to pay an extra $50 for plan upgrade from using too much data.

is the  error numbers bad sectors? if so i think thats normal, one of my crucial ssds has 16,000 bad sectors.. but it says it has 96% life left.

ive bought games on steam.. i never had them auto cancel.. 
i would imagine when the tx gets confirmed you will get an email saying your steam wallet has been credited. your bitcoin is not lost. bitpay knows you paid. do know tho steam charges tax, so if a game is 24.99 you have to load more than 25$

they sent out an email not too long ago.. when you signed up did you give them your proper email??

the recommended fee is low right now, much lower than you paid. i would imagine it wont take too much longer for your tx to get confirmed.
