I love that people are tipping so much in bits now.  We need to spread the love off of reddit too as much as possible.  Bitcoin doesn't seem so expensive now to the average person.  We have to get 1 bit to equal a dollar now as the goal.

Something like this in the future--non-official--is a VERY good idea.  This will allow the open, free world to TRULY have a voice.
Perhaps something can be developed where every issue can truly be voted on democratically.

Satoshis is a stupid fucking name.  Sorry, but I will ALWAYS feel this way.  I'm just an average bloke and that's just how I feel.  Also, I suck at math and I was told that right now a cup of coffee is 7000 bits.  If a cup of coffee is 7 kajillion satoshis then that's just fucking dumb.  Sorry man I am the common man and I'm telling you bits would work.  Everything else is a non-starter.
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:58:44
it is someone posting honestly in opposition to the carefully cultivated narrative that has been constructed that doesn't involve greed or personal enrichment..
Most people are here for self enrichment I believe.  Everyone should be.  Even you.  Not to get rich off other people but because in the end, bitcoin will allow all of us to get paid honestly for the work we do.  
I am late to the game.  Kudos to the fellas that mined early I say.  They kept this dream alive and for that they should be richly rewarded.
I really hope you reevaluate your position.  Bitcoin isn't about peace, love and happiness.  It's about honesty.  Absofuckinglute honestly--in my book anyhow.  Now in all likelihood that will lead to peace, love and happiness.
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:17:24
Looks like there should be a bitcoin update that rewards those financially for running full nodes.  Sounds like a weakness of the protocol to me.

Bits should be the default units.  People think in whole numbers.  I'd also like to see the option to send USD in a wallet that automatically gets converted to the current exchange rate of BTC.
Wallets should also calculate the lowest transaction fee and apply that when sending the remaining balance so I don't have to do the freaking math.
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:26:10
I'm fine with creating more currency.  Just give it to everyone equally if the whole premise is deflation is the problem.  You don't see that happening.  You see the central bank and bankers benefiting from their loans.  In essence, they create new money, loan it out and reap the rewards.  
If new money must be created, give it to everyone equally.
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:03:34
bits is definitely the way to go.

I think the biggest thing I do is try to sway trolls and disbelievers here.  I've also come up with good ideas now and then.
I actually was the one that started a post that led to coinbase allowing for purchases much smaller than what they were doing--mostly because my brother couldn't afford to buy the smallest units they were selling then.
I really hope you read this because I want you to see the power of words.

I love bitcoin.  It sucks as a unit of account.  All the wallets need to let you put the price in USD or whatever and click send then instanly convert to the current exchange rate and send the right amount of btc.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:42:44
I don't agree with your punishment without due process but I believe your message of holding the leaders of bitcoin up to a MUCH higher standard is spot on.
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:31:47
Yes or just take away the "coin" designation.  What it should do is allow people to quickly compare currencies of any type.

If you want bitcoin to go up in value, start giving bitcoin directly to politicians and businessmen.  
Only bankers and transaction competitors stand to benefit in a bitcoinless world.  The objective should be to get all others with power and media influence to really, really benefit from bitcoin's success.  The bankers and transaction competitors need to be marginalized.
We have to make those in power WANT bitcoin to succeed.

In 5-10 years, these could be approaching a dollar a piece.  It's amazing people still don't realize the value of a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:22:21
I agree.  All new money created by bankers and central bankers to be loaned out the way they decide is a complete scheme.

Also, I don't think it's obfuscation.  It's just much better marketing.  Not many people want to own a micro anything.  Even you aren't happy with your micro penis.  :P

@_date: 2014-05-12 22:09:00
Amazing how people can post dumb shit like this just complaining and people will just bandwagon.  
Let's put it this way if you don't think this is important.  I was going to spend some bitcoin this weekend and would have if electrum had the darkwallet anonymizer feature.  It's VERY FUCKING important and not because I said it is but because it fucking is.  Without it, people are afraid the IRS will expect them to calculate and pay taxes on the most trivial shit.
So shwag confuckingratulations on your newfound reddit points and steering the conversation away from a needed development.  If you had any moral sense about you, you'd post the same thing again with a Better title I guess.  Jesus fucking christ--people, what a bunch of bastards.
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:49:52
My post wasn't accidental.  I selfishly would like each bit to be worth a dollar.  I also believe this benefits everyone.  I think bitcoin truly is a rising tide that will lift all boats. 
For instance, I HATE many other cryptos but I would rather see any of them succeed over fiat because I think they are far more fair than fiat and I would more fully reap the rewards of my work with any of them compared to fiat.
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:02:55
Totally disagree and bitcoin's history supports me.  If you had been tipped 10,000 btc in 2009 and 2010 you would have complained.  Today you'd be rich. 
People seem to not understand how a popular deflationary currency works.
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:05:26
I am talking about the people complaining such as yourself.  
If someone receiving a tip deems it too small and doesn't collect it, they will regret the shit out of that in a few years.  Hopefully they'll remember their password.  That WILL assuredly teach them.
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:28:23

Anyone that wants to use Satoshis is trying to sabotage bitcoin.  That's the bottom line.
It's fucking plain as hell that it's stupid and everyone feels stupid just saying it.
If Satoshis become the default unit, I'll fucking sell my bitcoins and renounce the whole damn thing.
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:47:05
Also, I wouldn't say their core business is money transmission.  Banks create money.  They live off the returns from interest.  
If you are not aware of this you should google fractional reserve banking.  Ordinary banks can create new money but the reserve ratios are set by the central bank.
@_date: 2014-05-07 03:08:51
I think people like you may be trying to sabotage the popularity of Bitcoin.  To anyone with half a brain, they know Satoshi sounds stupid.

It does but they can collect fees with Ripple.  Also the Ripple currency is controlled by their friends and they can easily manipulate amounts and where it goes.
It's mostly a move to keep control of creating currency.
From their viewpoint, it's far the lesser of two evils.

I think it's people that DON'T want bitcoin to succeed that are trying to discourage tipping--as usual.  
These same people HATE the idea of using bits as a unit because it will obviously become popular.

What amazed me is you think Visa can't use bitcoin on the backend.  Bitcoin is cash man.  It doesn't have to serve all purposes and really shouldn't.  
So if you want to use bitcoin at McDonald's, you'll take your Visa there that has been preloaded with bitcoin or that you have credit with and you'll buy McDonald's.  How hard is that?
Also, bitcoin is programmable money.  If we ever want to buy McDonald's with bitcoin directly, we'll change the programming.

It is what it is.  You can dislike it but it simply is.  If it were a black hip-hop culture type name, I wouldn't carry it period.  If it were hillbilly units--same thing.
Satoshi sounds like some kind of fish to me.  I'm not alone.
@_date: 2014-05-03 23:02:56
Bitcoin could always use snapshotting/checksumming technology if this ever became an issue.  There is no need to have more than a few months worth of live historical records for carrying out transactions--probably less.  
@_date: 2014-05-11 12:44:38
This guy already knew that.  This is a staged comment to support his dislike of the term "bits".  He probably doesn't dislike it but rather is a supporter of a coin with much greater units and doesn't want bitcoin tipping to begin again--DOGE.
Bits is a term FAR SUPERIOR for marketing and the average person.  Everyone knows this and many just want to stop it before it catches on.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:37:28

The whole bitcoin ecosystem needs to start doing this.  Also, we need to start giving away a lot of bits now again.  Tipping has decreased tremendously since the truth is most people couldn't intuitively feel how much btc they were tipping.

Actually it would be the opposite since anyone with a small amount of hashing power should be able to take down GoldCoin if the statements about it's 51% protection being worthless are true.  
It appears to me they are onto something as they haven't been 51%ed yet.
Now I'm not promoting them, I'm just fucking sick of this problem AND the bitcoin node problem.  I don't own any GoldCoins so I don't give a shit what happens to them.  I just want my bitcoins to be protected.
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:04:08
It works both ways with bitcoin.  It's to help you "in the future" and spread bitcoin around.
100 BTC was worth only a few cents just a few years ago.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:50:04
Maybe we could establish a community trust system where we all agree on who's version of the blockchain to trust if a 51% attack does happen.  Is this possible or just dumb?
