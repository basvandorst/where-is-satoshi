Because it will totally be Trump's fault if they go hard on the crypto holder, SHE would have never thought about doing something like that... give me a break will you... 
This is way over your stupid democrats/republicans debate(canadian here)... don't you know already they are the same ?
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:32:30
How about litecoin ?
Does it have much more confirmations?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:25:13
But do they understand/accept it means the end of the american empire ?
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:27:38
Is there anything that could save Greece?
They are stuck in the vicious circle of the end game of socialism.
They ran out of other people's money. 
To use bitcoins as your currency you need to be even more efficient and disciplined than with fiat money because you can't print them indefinitely but you can divise them indefinitely, it will take a while for people to like reverse inflation, it's hard to expect that from the greek. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:43:04
Probably how it will end up to be. Since the greeks themselves can't manage their country, the private business will have to for them.
Or will they try to be the first cashless society ?
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:09:56
They suck at managing fiat money, they would suck at managing bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:34:03
You are probably right. 
The Greeks cannot manage Euros, why would they be better at managing bitcoins?
I'm very curious how this saga will end.
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:34:49
Yeah, the recipe for profits stays the same whatever currency you use...
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:16:02
But will the government let any big player shake the banks monopoly on monetary transactions with fiat that is approved by the state?
Cuz terrorism, drugs and think of the kids you perverts.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:47:49
They would have to be fiscally transparent and responsible, not going to happen for those reasons. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:14:16
Imagine Greece switching to BTC...
One can dream.
The infrastructure is there for them to use and much cheaper than banks and IMF fees, the only problem is that they would have to manage their bitcoin properly. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:44:15

As long as everyone in control is happy, fiat is kept alive. That's why we keep printing more.

That sounds like an even worst idea. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:14:53
Yeah , but they are probably 90% copy and paste. Except the rate is much higher in Canada. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:16:22
We got enough altcoins he is right.
If they really want one ,they could do a merge coin for LTC/VTC which are more accessible to mine. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:32:01
The good thing about btc is that anyone can own some. Getting a credit card is supposed to be easy, but can be complicated for some. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:55:16
Not sure they can at this point.
There is some methods for obfuscation, but I guess one could still follow up the money. A big organization could easily come with a scheme to make it very painful to follow the money. 
At least we know it's not created out of nothing. 
This can also be a wet dream for the government, no black market, work for cash without income tax, etc.. if they can associate each address to someone. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:27:10

The major difference between credit card and btc is that you can't spend money you don't have with btc. 
That might eventually change if these big players jumps in, but I doubt they will. The fiat system is too lucrative for them. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:47:18
CC can give you money you don't have. That's something you can't do (yet) with btc. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:26:39
The big difference is that the lender(the bank usually) will have to have the money you want in hand and won't be able to print more money over it once you borrow it to buy something. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:38:38
Nothing they can do and should do. 
This is the far west, as we wanted it, ruthless and without regulation. 
This is a lesson we will learn from to apply better rules for ourselves and what exchange we decide to trust. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:39:36
Their merchant base is already huge and you won't need to educate them on it, it will come if paypal decides to without them even noticing. 
That is what's important. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:01:41
The solution is , before you start selling your btcs, ie when they are worth 100K a piece. Sell all your assets and move to a better(tax heaven) country. 
Then you sell them for a property, cash, car, etc...
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:26:22
We have a lot of challenge to overcome to even become sustainable. 
I prefer to call bitcoins/crypto step 2 of the information age, who knows where we will go from there. 
Step 1 being the internet, having the world connected, this was needed to have btc. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:35:25
Correct me if I'm wrong but the network don't need much to be sustained. 
If too many miners leaves then the diff will adjust accordingly. The blocks will always be mined at the same rate, that is the only thing we care about right?
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:07:31
I'm fine with that. Every year that passes by my Canadian passport is less desirable anyway. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:44:59
ffs you need to call the bank in advance if you want to take out more than 1000$ out...
But the banks can makes errors in the 100 000$ and no one blinks an eye...
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:10:13
You would be surprised. I believe those people could benefit a lot from using bitcoins instead of money sending business. The more btc propagate the more it will become an option for them. I can see pawnshop starting to trade btcs soon with a high fees of course. Wonder why they don't yet...

@_date: 2014-10-01 03:33:48
Heard of it. 
Is it functional yet ?
I'm also aware of bitcloud, but they weren't going quite in the direction I was expecting.
I do think the blockchain technology can be a part of it. It can be a way to reward nodes(ISP also known as bandwith provider).

@_date: 2014-08-29 12:29:49

Once you used btc to pay for things on the internet. Using paypal becomes such a pita. 
With the disadvantage of not being protected but I've never had to do that anyway.

Banks are a necessity for any kind of business, but they are above the law. They can decide if your business will be successful or not. 
The reason they closed those accounts is sign they are scared. 
Bank are not working to help the economy grow, they are there to make their wallet even fatter. 
About time we found a better solution to the problem banks are helping with, the transition won't be easy though. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:56:44
I have used Cavirtex since may and all the problems you mentioned didn't happened to me. Tickets were answered the same day and very professionally. Verification did take a while but we were warned. 
I've got my debit card quickly and if she would have read the instruction , she would have known that it was 10$ for the card. If you are 10$ short and can't afford the fees. Maybe trading crypto isn't for you...
@_date: 2014-10-01 03:20:07
I've been saying for a while that we need to switch the "internet" to such type of network so "they" can't shut it down when something they don't disagree happens on it. I think the internet is equivalent to free speech and everyone have the right to communicate. 
But it's an evolutionary rule that change happens more quickly when it is forced by another change in the environment. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:14:13
I doubt BTC will ever become the petrocurrency to use, next in line is the chinese yuan and they are impatiently waiting. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:32:41
Won't happen because the governments can't control how much gets printed, how you use it  and who gets to use it. Governments like their power. They usually use their currency to control their growth, wealth and make people believe they are rich. 
Bitcoin wasn't in their plan and will disrupt their plan to print money forever. 
As long as countries exists, fiat currency will too, but bitcoin might become more valuable and desirable than those currency at which point it could be considered a world currency, as can all the crypto coins because they aren't attached to any nation. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:52:04
Even if they did invented it before, the major strength of crypto is that it is decentralized and run by the users, miners, etc...
Would a private corporation even know what do to with it? It is not usually in their spirit to let everyone profit from their "patent" and for crypto to succeed you need the miners to be free. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:28:52
Yeah, at least I'll be able to go in a warm island(what Canadian doesn't dream of that) spend my btcs there and not be taxed ridiculously... 
But it's also complicated because you need to stay a few month in the country to keep some citizen privileges.
That's definitely something I'll need to talk with and warn the guy who does my taxes.

no you can't. 
Those people won't be free, they might charge less than banks, but it won't be free. 
Unless you own a bank, that's another level...
Usually a transfer of that level will have some legal implication too. Something that needs notarization. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:05:25
The major difference with bitcoin vs fiat, is that anyone can look at the ledger and see where the coins went and came from. 
The btc blockchain is much more accountable than whatever budget the government claims to have. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 03:58:50
The value of a coin is not necessarily determined by how many people mine it, ie, the network hash rates.  
If NASDAQ or a country decide to creates it's own blockchain(network of miners)(crypto currency) it is as good as whatever blockchain currently operating. As long as there are miners and node runnings, you don't really needs millions of miners to run an efficient blockchain.
They could just use it as an infallible ledger.

@_date: 2016-06-13 02:00:31
The exchanges(like the banks) sometimes don't really have the cashflow to accommodate an instant withdrawal of all the funds they hold for their clients. Don't you remember all the exchanges that closed with user account frozen ? If it starts crashing people will rush to move their coins, that's when the exchange overloads and can't delivers the requests. Then they have to close/freeze transactions. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 01:53:51
I think 10K by 2020 is reasonable.

@_date: 2016-06-13 03:59:03
As much as I like the freedom that bitcoin offers, it is very much open to mismanagement and incompetence due to it's own nature. That's why OP advice to keep all your coin in your wallet, unless you plan to trade them in short term. 
Also, some exchange will store coins in "external wallet", which are not connected to the net and can take a while to transfer to their platform when they need it.
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:07:43

More like what was implemented better in litecoin than in bitcoin. 
as far as I know, litecoin is a clone of bitcoin with different parameters.
I'm no specialist but I think they tweaked the litecoin blockchain to be little faster than bitcoin and being able to handle more transaction per block... if that makes sense...
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:22:03
I used to buy games at Humble Bundle with the LTC I mined and transfered into BTC, I think they were amongst the first to accept it. I'm sure someday I might tell myself, yep, I paid the price of a luxury car for a few stupid games... that would be a funny story to tell.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:59:44

I was kinda expecting it to be in the high 4000 this morning when I woke up.

Exactly, the point of BTC and crypto is to bypass those payment channels. 
I say make it free and ask for a crypto donation.

Difference is, the world could "survive" on 1btc for trading forever, but they couldn't use  1millions tons of water forever.

The gas is real and finite. 
I know people use energy to mine coins, but it's quite intangible once they are mined.

@_date: 2015-07-10 01:47:55
by real I meant a material thing, ie not some software that rely on  advanced mathematics that in an event of all tech failure would be gone :P.  
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:37:21
But in the usage of btc, why is it more valuable ?
Both can be divided in a millionth if needed. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:33:16
My reflection is that both transaction serve kinda the same purpose. 
Unlike gold, when you trade it you have finite utility for it. 
 
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:08:20
Kinda like the same thing Uber is doing to the taxi industry. 
Good for them.
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:31:29
But you can divide what you have by 10 indefinitely.
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:29:59
I dunno, since it is not fiat money I would think there would be a logical explanation to it...
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:45:46
Technically speaking, what is the difference between a 1btc transaction and a 0.1btc. Sure at the mining process it took more energy to be produced. But once in the market, that 1btc can be divided infinitely. Is the fees alone enough to keep the market going? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:56:37
But how do 1btc command anything?
If you hold it it doesn't do shit... ?
How does that work. I kinda know all that technical stuff but it is still ... weird mathematics...
In some ways it is much like fiat money. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:24:37
But unlike traditional fiat, you can divide that 0.1 in a million fractions if you wanted. Not so much with 1$ of fiat and each millionths would be as valid/legit as any other transaction.  
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:29:45
Computers don't care, still treated as the same operation.
Why is it more valuable ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:50:01
Gobernment, at least in Canadia will replace the dealer, what a great time line to live in !!!
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:36:04
I know that I can only get two 5 cents coins out of 10 cents(cuz they have discarded the pennies by now because it cost more to produce than it's worth)
I know it is a "retarded" question but it is all about a fundamental difference between btc and fiat. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 01:38:20
If you ever try to buy much gold, you will understand that buying bitcoin is much easier...
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:26:50
It's different, you will see the end of the bottle quickly, technically bitcoin are truly infinitely divisible while water molecules are not. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:50:04
That's way too advanced for me. 
 
Go easy. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:52:27
Yes you will, just be patient before they implement support for the new coin since the BTG devs haven't share the details yet apparently. They are not being sent anywhere, you will  just have them in their new chain.

The other fork must be even worst when it comes to lost coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:45:15
Exactly... what fork. 
No one cares about fork. People should start to notice. 
Even if your fork is better, chances are that a majority of owner never claimed their coins from the new chain. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:21:01
How many of those are lost forever too ?
Probably many from the early days were forgotten/lost.

Yes, check the beta wallet, that's where those new coin appears first. There is still a chance that it could be total failure and they refuse to support it in which case there will still be ways to recuperate your coins in other wallets with your pass.

Cavirtex ffs. Once verified you will be able to deposit cash into your bank account if you ever sell btc, better do it now than later. 
It takes a while to verify, took a week and a half for me. But once you do it, it takes another few days to get the cash into your account...
patience is key. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:20:50

Still a noob into the coin game , but as far as I understand it, the strength and trust in the currency is partly built on the power of the network. In the long run people will just run miner as a hobby to keep the network alive?

What government will be the first to outlaw bitcoin?

But what if it wasn't really in their long term plan to give us the control of the currency. I have a feeling they like printing money, because they can easily control the economy that way. BTC could and will work, but those using it will be much more vulnerable to the market, the gov won't be able to regulate and control that market the same way it does now. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:01:11
That's not how it work. It's a market based on offers and demands.

"Modern monetary units"
lol , I'm sure the Roman and Greeks thought their money was modern too. We didn't invent  FIAT money.  It's an experiment that have been tried many times before and it failed each time. But it won't happen to us, we are  much smarter right?
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:41:23
People are used to debit card and credit card by now. They will see the bitcoin like that, no need for paper imho. Use a card with a chip as the wallet keys would be more safe than printing it on paper.  
@_date: 2013-06-12 03:03:32
nice, how stupid can one go. 
I think it's only a matter of time until the fiat system goes to war with crypto currency. We all know they have the government on their side because they have too much to lose. I predict the switch won't be pretty.

Some vendor would switch entirely to btc only because holding USD would be too risky.

Laws of entropy says that eventually there will be 0 BTC in circulation. That's an interesting problem BTC will have to solve. But as was said we could divide it almost infinitely so the whole BTC market could eventually be less than a (now)BTC.

You can use multibit, tried it and seems to work, dont have coin in it but a friend does, it takes much less bandwith and time to sync. seems legit. Android wallet work fine too. Buying the btc is the problem... there is a 30$ transfer fee to get fiat on cavirtex and then you can trade it for btc. Takes money to make money...
Cheapest way is to find someone who owns some and willing to sell and meet in person.

Same here. But every day that passes by and I'm quite sure they have no clue how to manage a budget, I'm in Quebec if that makes things worst...
I plan to spend my BTCs out of here.

Church of Satoshi, who is in ?
Think about it, no taxes...

It could, but it will take time. The adoption of BTC is far from having reach the critical mass necessary for bigger merchant to take notice. I expect it to take at least another 5 years for it to take off. But then again, things move fast these days , who knows what could happen. If a major store chain decides to give it a try and push it, it could become a reality before we realize it.

Give it a week ffs.

It will still be on the fringe until the vendor accept crypto or we have crypto to fiat ATM on every corner. To use your BTC in a real world situation, you have to plan it a few days ahead, that kinda suck right now. Central banks won't collapse because they are backed by the government. The alternative will happen when people decide they have been fooled long enough by the fiat money, it could take a while...

I'd buy an E36 and convert it :P.
It is even cheaper than a corvette if you can do the work.

A massive cash out will means major redistribution of coins, good thing for the long term of the currency. Whatever happens with that case, it's all good for BTC.

Who is Dwolla ?
The beautiful thing about the bitcoin economy, is they can cut one head, but chances are real high that 10 more alternative will grow up and stronger than ever. 
Are we starting to get their attention yet?
I predict the next war could very well be over the bitcoins, the age of information technology has arrived for good.

Understand what, what is the point of making money if you can't enjoy it. Those people just don't enjoy driving cars, but they surely spend it elsewhere. It's a stupid example, those guy are now worth billions, I agree with don't spend what you can't afford...

Don't worry Barack, keep printing money like there is no tomorrow. Everything will be alright, FIAT was a success in the past right?
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:34:10
I have not used it yet though. 
Do you think the bankers are starting to get nervous yet?

Is the war started yet ?

You only lose when you sell.

Those currencies are so young that only a fool would think they are infallible.

The april drop took more than 6 months to recover.

That will only work if the merchant can replace those goods they sell by buying them with btc too. The public only do business with a small part of the economy there is tons of businesses that you have no idea exists. For those business to deal in fixed btc prices, all the distributors that work with that vendor will have to transact in btc too.

They are printing it, don't you know that debt is money?
Every loan they do, they can make more loan out of it even before it gets paid. 
The government can't afford such a system to fail. 
The algorithm for loans and modern banking wouldn't stand a chance in a open market world. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:48:36
Truly is, the only thing that will stop BTC growth is if the government get responsible and stop deficit spending. But we all know that those fools we elect couldn't balance a budget if their lives depended on it.
