Fantastic idea.
Maybe make smaller donations to more charities. Take your time, make careful decisions. So far you've picked an interesting and eclectic group of recipients.
Many funds specialise, and only accept applications from specific types of organisations, or for specific types of project. They might have several different things that interest them. This keeps the number of applications from getting overwhelming.
Also, they often have criteria for the size or income of the charity, or have other factors to weed out organisations that in their opinion wouldn't need the grant or don't have the capacity to use it effectively.
Before donating, check their annual report to find out how much income they have. Some big name charities have way too much already whilst others doing good work struggle to exist, let alone grow. But on the other hand, the bigger charities may have the capacity to use funding more effectively, so you need to discriminate carefully.
I work with a small charity called the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust. It's a medical condition that affects 1 in 80 pregnancies, they lose the baby, and it can be fatal for the woman if not spotted quickly. Future fertility is often affected, so there's a mix of medical and emotional needs that we address. They're the only effective charity in the world for this common condition. They provide urgent medical advice to women, and training materials for health professionals. They want to promote more research into the condition. It's their 20th anniversary this year, so they're well grounded but need funds to expand.
Is that the sort of organisation that might interest you? I'd like to apply, will check out your form.
