Hope your feeling is wrong...

Good time to buy and hope will go back to another  heights.
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:21:12
That’s my idea too but let’s see.
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:38:01
I’m never losing patience.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:12:35
Hope so...
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:43:37
Step by step to the top.
@_date: 2019-07-18 10:33:41
Not liking this opportunity.
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:20:05
We’ll see but everything around 12k and even above is fine for me at the moment.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:23:02
At least 20k and hope to be soon.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:57:43
I’m curious to see what the weekend will bring us.
@_date: 2019-06-03 09:36:08
Interesting bearish prediction.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:57:32
That’s definitely sounds not right. Just no way.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:10:46
I’m interested about your experience with Ledger cuz i have in mind to take one but firstly i’m approaching.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:12:05
Good eye.
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:52:32
What about Blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:31:42
Sure. The early signs are in fact already.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:21:32
Thanks. You’re using Nano S may be? Any experience about Nano X?
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:54:09
Sounds good but who will wait that time.
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:50:34
Why it’s a bad idea to store coins there?
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:38:10
1.5 years to reach 500K or even 1mil? That sounds like fairytale.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:24:55
That sounds very good. I’ll definitely try it.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:08:51
Is it actually possible to run out?
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:06:22
We’ll see it soon.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:51:44
Come on. You can do it. ��
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:14:35
Hope the bulls will take it up again soon.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:14:11
Yeah. Why not. ��
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:00:39
Every innovation struggles at the start. Only the time can say is it good or not but it’s not so easy as it’s looking.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:11:12
Yes there is... couple of years ago. �� Now seriously. Better wait cuz now BTC is expensive and there will be correction in price for sure. Everything around 6K will be fine for buying i think.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:29:56
That summer and autumn you’re expecting the highest price?
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:02:14
