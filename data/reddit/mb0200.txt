If you receive new crypto because you held before fork then it’s probably similar to a spin-off, I would guess

Hi guys 
I’m looking at hardware wallets. And wondering do you have to have admin rights to a desktop if you’re to use your wallet?
For example, let’s say you’re traveling with an iPhone and your wallet. And the only computer you have access to is one in hotel lobby.  Oftentimes these computers only have a browser enabled and you can’t install other browsers (must use ie and can’t install chrome) and they also have USB ports blocked off. 
So for travel you need to
Have a chrome book basically?  Can a phone be used ? I read something about androids  being usable but prob not iPhones. Right ?
Thank you

any users here use an Samsung/Android  phone with  USB OTG With their Trezor?
Looking to buy a burner Samsung phone that also supports magnetic secure transmission Samsung pay. So far I found galaxy S6 is my cheapest option for MST but am wondering if it would work with Trezor. 
Thanks

Right there with you.  Late Dec 2017 first entry at $18k and I’ve been steadily buying. Averaging down

Mycelium - when I plug my trezor into usb OTG android and launch the wallet app my trezor walllet is automatically loaded as soon as I plugin.  No prompt for pin.  What am I doing wrong?
Thank you.

Hi guys.  Relatively new joiner to the ride.  Can anyone recommend a good iOS app that has watch complications so I can show BTC real time price on my Apple Watch?
Similar to showing a single ticker and price for stocks. 
Thank you

Why no VPN?   
Exchange related or is it risk of vpn provider ripping you off ?

Has anyone read this?
//edit.  Clearly the suspect in question was involved with some shady stuff and if he’s helped facilitate movement of stolen coins that’s one thing to punish.  My observations are around the penalties just for allowing private transactions. //// 
They’ve effectively criminalized privacy.  What they did to bank secrecy around the globe is just nuts. That every bank on the planet asks customers if they’re a “US person”
Similarly they can go and strong-arm every exchange on the planet  for full AML/KYC info.  
Look how they attack “mixers” in this doc. 
Sure they won’t be able to freeze your account anymore but they’ll know how much you own and just say pay up mofo or you’ll get 30 yrs for that $3k you owe us. 
As a US citizen you already have to disclose financial accounts you own outside the states.  Brokerages already feed every single trade to the government.  Soon for crypto unless something is done to protect users. 
It seems the only privacy that will ever come is with broader roll-out out of crypto as final forms of payment, right ? 
What is it any of their business what you do with your money?   What is it their business to arbitrarily decide that savings accounts can only have six withdrawals per month ?
I am very new to BTC topic but am cheering on for the People to take financial privacy back.   This whole premise “we gotta watch you so we make sure you’re not a  criminal and if you do ANYTHING to impede our watching of you that’s a crime in itself” is absolutely nuts.  How did this the greater populace submit so easily to this?  I mean people are installing cameras inside their homes and they would object if govt and vendors were open about the back doors provided.  And yet surveillance of your finances is accepted by the populace.

Yes they’re ACH deposits but I maintain several bank accounts with this trick.   No fee so far. 
Just deposit $250 once per month via push ach and scoop it right out same day.

Far from it. I’m buying. 
I’m just hoping for tech to keep one step ahead of fiat peddlers and confiscators

Coins should get some of the commodity tailwind with Nuchin confirming that WH prefers to keep molesting the dollar. 
If BTC just treads water and hedges inflation I’m a happy camper.  To replace gold and to replace savings accounts would be key.     The ability to be truly mobile with your assets is a dream IMO

If someone gave you a partial bitcoin years go and it’s just the keys on a paper how do you “digitize” them?
Is it possible to do so and retain complete privacy ? As if someone gave you cash?

THANKS.  Great looking app. Just got it.

Folks who were in before the end of 2017 ramp up.   What made you decide to put money into crypto?  Especially money that’s not just pocket change. (For me it would be anything above a grand). 
Curious to hear how people were exposed and when you had the aha moment.  Because so many of us knew about it. Heard about it but never saw it as an Investment but more of technology and didn’t pay too much attention to it
Thanks in advance for sharing.

Crypto pro is giving me $16,970 BTC price and Coinbase is $16,400.  Is this normal ?
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:29:24
Thanks for sharing. I started averaging in little by little every week. 
For me the aha was when I realized what decentralization meant.   I absolutely love the idea that wealth can be kept and not confiscated.  Portable.  Hopefully anonymous also one day.   I don’t quite understand the privacy implications yet. Part of me thinks it’s a gift card you buy and if it’s thru an exchange then every penny can be tracked back to yon.  This needs to change. Hopefully it does and that’s what I’d be cheering for:   A true cash replacement. 
I haven’t gotten any other coins. I figure that because I’m buying so small at a time it’s best for me to just average in over time.    I imagine BTC is akin to USD in forex market.  There maybe sexier currencies but there’s one main one that’s got broader take up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:15
Legally yes. 
But how’s this tracked what you spend your bitcoins on? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:11
A) not yet. 
B) eventually some down the line may take bitcoin.   Especially in free countries. (Not under IRS/Fed reserve jurisdiction)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:42
This.  Thank you for explaining it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:20
What if you never exchange the bitcoins back to fiat currency but just pay for things/services with bitcoin?
This wouldn’t be any different than buying Euros when EURUSD was 1.05 then just holding Euros, say until 1.4 and then spending them in Europe to buy something.

Hello all.   Anyone know how credit card funded Coinbase posts for Amex (US based ) or Chase 
Does it code as a purchase or Cash Advance?

This is based on the honor system.  
If youre spending abroad it’s even more untraceable  
Sort of like shopping across state lines.  You’re supposed to declare your shopping and pay state sales tax on it   
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:13:19
I agree. i would rather people err on the side of caution especially if they’re flirting with tax issues potentially.   
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:01:28
Not an accountant but if this works like stocks and futures of course you can report losses.  Up to $3k directly reduces your other taxable income
And if you have total net losses (gains-losses) over 3k then the excess you get to “bank” by carrying it to next year and you get to reduce your taxable  gains in following year. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:13:52
How do stocks get treated for this?  Assuming you’re not a PERMANENT resident because if you are you’d still owe irs taxes on global income. 
Assuming you’re not how does this work:
You buy a bunch of stock while in USA.   You never sell.  You leave USA, transfer stock to foreign brokerage where you’re a citizen,  then down the road you sell it?
I think USA made rules to prevent abusing this after Saveron (the Facebook dude) skipped and renounced citizenship before the IPO made him rich. 
Maybe others can opine or enlighten on this. Maybe there’s a time limit or a dollar amount? 
Would this be any different than this scenario:
Costa Rican Citizen works and lives in USA.  Buys house in Costa Rica.    Then one day retires to Costa Rica.  No USC or GC. doesn’t have to file taxes anymore.  One day sells this house in costa  Rica. Gain Happened outside  USA and when individual wasn’t a US person for IRS purposes right ?

Most crypto isn’t anonymous. You can be tracked off the block chain. I wouldn’t advise it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:15:24
Perfect. Makes sense.  Similar to his futures are treated.  You get one net number but with crypto you have to schedule D it?
//edit. Similar to futs in sense of one net number, assuming all is short term with BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:15
Futures just allow quicker price discovery.   Else it takes longer for price to adjust like it does in real estate. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:06:52
How does this work?
Assume it’s all short term and 30% rate. 
Buy coin one for $100,000
Sell coin one for $200,000= $100,000 taxable gain
= $30,000 owed 
Then you buy coin two for $200,000
Sell coin two for $100,000 for $100,000 loss.
How does he loss factor in?
Your total gains minus losses are Zero. So while you’re reporting both your net effect is no tax owed. Right ?
Or are you saying it’s like this:
$30,000 taxes owed on first trade
- $3,000 losses allowed 
= pay up $27,000 sucka
I don’t think it’s this way. $3k is the total net loss for your entire year all accounts and trades combined, right ?
