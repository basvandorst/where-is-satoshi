Happy Birthday Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:44:30
I didn't buy enough BTC :&lt;
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:51:30
I have been trying to contact Blockchain.info support for like 2 weeks and I got zero response from 5 tickets, it seems they are to busy with the tickets and stuff. I would try to contact their twitter and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:38:55
I wanna become a hockey player now D:
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:02:13
This is cool I made it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:17:44
Such a great way to start the new year with, congratulations!
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:43:25
Damn a hotel which accepts Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:49:12
Looks cool, will try and let you know what I think soon.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:25:51
Can't imagine how happy you are right now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:42:15
If thats the case then have some patient and maybe the fees will go down.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:36:58
It might be because of Holidays, I haven't got response from Blockchain.io as well for like one week, have patient and it will be solved. CoinJar looks legit so I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:38:57
that's the reason fees are that high :D
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:47:09
It's supposed to be a meme, chill guys.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:40:23
Keep your funds there for now but if you want more secure way of keeping your BTC then use offline wallets.
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:39:52
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:43:46
It only kills when ETH dumps.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:11:56
Other exchanges should do this, huobi and OKEx should be the first to do such thing, they've been acting shady as fuck.
Bitfinex started with the fees reduction, decentralized exchange development and now this, binance is closely following, won't be surprised if they do this too.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:25:08
I have seen the video, and I repeat to you the same thing: DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, if you're new you probably don't know this but the Bitconnect scam was possible because of Youtube videos, now go back to Youtube, I'm sure it'll help you.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:36:13
8k is not a bad price to be honest, depends when you've got in.
It's more like a good price to get in.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:55:35
Can't wait to see how low it can hit, I'm really looking forward a big buy.
What exchange do you guys use?
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:07:40
Saw it earlier, can't wait to see how this affects the markets.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:21:29
Most likely haha.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:06:22
And people say it's not safe on the exchanges...
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:21:15
That survey should be made on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:39:29
Guys, we've got a fudster here, quite a bad one to be honest.
Calling all the buttcoiners here.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:15:25
It's called *fudster*.
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:14:45
They froze your account for legitimate concerns and ask you to submit a support ticket to see what's wrong, instead you spit bullshit over them.
Seems legit, redditor for 3 months.
If anyone takes you seriously they're dumb.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:51:05
Man, the world is getting out of control.
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:43:25
Yeah, I was surprised too, they weren't there a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:34:57
Perhaps the adoption will start after that happens.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:46:48
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:59:12
If you were to be worried about something you'd do your own research, instead you send it here and expect to get a "response" when you actually just want to spread more FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:23:58
Cold attack, market actually needs to clean of useless "investors" that take the media too seriously.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:29:03
I'm about to strike a buy order on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:27:59
It's just Binance trying to join the battle against Bitfinex with a "rewarding" marketing campaign.
Check this out: 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:24:40
Bitfinex had reduced fees to 0.0004 after SegWit.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:18:17
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:20:02
This hits just in time with Bitfinex implementing an anti-manipulation software Irisium which is supposed to regulate the markets.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:03:29
Depends on how you see it, you're using the ATH instead of the latest price you have bought
I have bought at the last dip this january that was around 6.5k
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:54:24
$100k this Easter.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:39:02
Where did you get that 60% from?
It went from around 11,000 to 9,000 from what I've seen.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:44:31
People want to move the cash and have it all together.
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:52:00
Are you fucking dumb?
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:51:41
The exchange recently added new trading fiat markets, so that might explain a lot of the current movement.
edit: take a look at the biggest wallet 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:50:46
If you've been into cryptocurrencies for a while then you probably remember the silk road seizure, 144,333 BTC in just that one, if they need more BTC they just gotta go on with a "operation".
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:47:27
Would be interesting to see which ones are the most used ones from their 3 cryptos.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:28:07
Exactly why I still think there is a lot of room for Bitcoin over the next few years.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:20:48
True, sometimes you just gotta *chill and moon*.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:31:57
At least they'll HODL.
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:40:55
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:37:17
I could see that on a sweatshirt.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:56:21
Russian adoption is stronger than everything.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:21:31
Yet nobody uses them.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:36:06
You are forgetting that Bitfinex has recently launched new fiat markets and Binance is considering doing so soon.
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:04:09
That's Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:38:18
Is that an MSI?
