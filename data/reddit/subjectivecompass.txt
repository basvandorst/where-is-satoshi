Didn't do your research?

If you're investing hundreds of thousands in unstable jokes, you'll need more than 2 cents. Most investors who have held more than a few months could sell at a profit.  You haven't lost until you sell.

I've been DCA with Cashapp for about 6 months now, easy to move to wallet / cold storage device and relatively low markup on purchases.  
Although I'm obviously in a good mood because I've only ever bought BTC in the last 6 months...

I've only used Cashapp's wallet and moved bitcoin to a ledger from there.  I read today that they are allowing bitcoin deposits now to the public, but I have not tried.

Nothing offensive about it, just ironic.  The comment in the thread asks ' how on earth is this racist/sexist?' then makes an assumption about a race and sex in the next sentence.

This comment is so ironic it hurts.

This sounds like you are blinded by wanting to be with your son.  Your wife can't hold you hostage like this man.  Do not go through with this deal, there is a better way.  
Get a better lawyer.  How on earth do you think she has this kind of power?  You even offered to move countries. You have way more negotiating power than you think. Get out of her purse.

I'm afraid I need an ELI5 on this one.  I am very much for having a truly secure method to maintain an online identity, is the consensus here that this is the goal of Microsoft?  How does the blockchain factor in?

Very interesting, thank you.
