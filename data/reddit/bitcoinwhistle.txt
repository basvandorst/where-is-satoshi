If you really want to be transparent, can you give us a sense of how many Bitcoin were stolen? You definitely have some idea of magnitude (1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000), some rough idea?

I don't get r/bitcoin. If it's bad news just downvote it because you own bitcoin?

Thanks for the primary source link! Gonna get ugly.

"In the IRC obtained by FOX Business, Karpeles denies the document was produced by Mt. Gox, but confirms that it is “more or less” legitimate."
Probably a consultant or potential buyer that made the copy and the pdf is accurate in terms of data points.  700k+ bitcoin are really gone if this is true.

Show me one link. It hasn't.

The distinction he is making is that you can own bitcoin (not illegal to own and transact in) but you cannot purchase bitcoin with yuan on exchanges because 3rd party payment processor and bank wires can't not transact with bitcoin exchanges.

Can you comment on your or the teams background? Also, what ways are there to ensure that a successful strategy would not by seen by you?

You seem more confused. Mining plays no role here. With an exchange you send USD and Bitcoin to the exchange, trade on the exchange, and withdraw from them. You hope the exchange is credible and will send you your USD and Bitcoin when you ask. Mtgox is probably insolvent meaning they don't have the USD and Bitcoin they were supposed to keep. 
Mtgox is run by some incompetent people and as more professionals start getting into the exchange business, this event will be a small blip in the history of Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin is 580 and the price on Gox's site is basically irrelevant.

Where did he say everything is fine?

Old news.

Direct banks are getting notifications as well. So it's both payment processors and banks.

Stop downvoting this because you are long Bitcoin. I don't get r/Bitcoin sometimes.

Up now but super slow.

My interpretation is that they lost the private keys. They aren't 'lost' but they are gone for ever basically. Temporarily unavailable means available when they can crack the encryption which may take a couple thousand years.
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:18:21
You shouldn't trade bitcoin.

I posted this last month on /bitcoin: "Coinbase security concern - convince Coinbase to add authentication for sending Bitcoin."
It got a lot of activity and Fred responded saying they would add additional authentication. Really happy they kept their word and implemented it. Thanks for listening to the community Coinbase!

This is the first post with a primary source from their site. Reality should not just be ignored because it is bad.

I think you are right. Your post will get flamed and downvoted.

People on r/bitcoin tend to down vote anything that is negative about bitcoin as soon as they hear one argument making the news pro-bitcoin. This should be a discussion but instead it just gets down voted into oblivion.

This is so dumb it's actually kind of impressive.

I have had a couple Chinese friends translate and they disagree. They see it as strongly advising to withdraw. It's up to interpretation but they think Bobby would have been more direct if he wanted people to keep rmb on the site.

Just a very tiny slightly minuscule bit of logic:
61% of Hedge Fund Capital is managed by top 100 funds at 1.4 trillion AUM. Let's add the rest. All Hedge Fund 2.3 trillion AUM. Total value of gold is 7 trillion. Let's now take ALL of the Hedge Fund money and put it into Bitcoin. Still not there :( 
To use the great georedd's glorious phrasing, if you like my analysis its fair to show it or if you dislike georedd's analysis, that works too:

I sincerely appreciate some healthy devil's advocate. Let me address your three point concerns.
Point 1: Imagine a case where you log into Coinbase.com spelled like Coinbaes.com. You type in your account information and Authy code. Now the third-party is in your account. They quickly try to send off all of the bitcoin on your account. Presently they can. With 2FA they wouldn't be able to unless you happen to try to send money as well. Not to go crazy with security but maybe an email verification if you try sending a large nominal amount or percentage amount of your balance. Also, bluetooth 2FA would eliminate that case because the thief's computer wouldn't be near your smartphone.
Point 2: Agreed, it would completely be the user's fault but I think it's always a fair assumption that there will be users who are less logical than the bunch. We can let some sort of natural selection process take place or prevent them from having the opportunity to make a dumb decision. 
Point 3: Slightly different case where you might have your computer on and lose control in which the person taking control wouldn't be able to send money off.
I understand that these are extreme and tail risk scenarios but the incentives for theft are so high, the extra couple seconds of authentication could save just one person, possibly more.

I would really like to know what that means too. Sounds like it might be an alternative to deposits with vouchers.

I did email them and got no response. Might need to be a coordinated effort to make the change.

Didn't see that but we are on the same page. Hopefully they hear us this time.

No idea what you mean. I literally grabbed from their Weibo post.

Is your 2015 target: World GDP?
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:15:49
Key Points:
- **Temporarily** unable to provide RMB services.
- New product "currency lock" incentivizing people to keep their bitcoin and not just sell.
- $5 million in financing will keep BTC China kicking.
- Acknowledging PBOC said Bitcoin transactions are commodity trading and people have the freedom to do it at their own risk. 
- Fee enacted to prevent large speculation. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:28:47
News means higher probability of BTC China announcing a new third party processor. That is why people should care.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:02:28
I think optionality on the users end for this security is smart. Giving a couple simple options like the ones you proposed could go a long way.
