This is the exact logic behind the blockchain lmao.

This is like the definition of shills attempting to cause FUD. No one knows shit about Stripe, no one gives a fuck either. Fuck the shills talking about their own crypto investments.

Well, I’ve heard that in bullion houses 1 out of 4 ounces of owned gold actually exist, and that were due to stop gold mining in 2030 because they’ll run dry. So naturally both of those things will implode the price of gold and anything reliant on gold. So I thought that Bitcoin and other cryptos would also have a profound effect caused by this global event. I didn’t mean to insinuate that crypto could ever affect gold.
But I believe you should set a percentage between all of your investments, like 25 in gold, 25 in silver and 50 in crypto for example, and if any of them rise faster than the rest causing it to shift from 50 in coins to like 60, than sell off some coins and put it in the metals to rebalance.

Nice, giving an insult to a question not previously asked (or asked but not given attention because I couldn’t find one in the hundreds of threads I’ve searched.) instead of giving an answer, like if you think that it is or isn’t, or linking me to a thread explaining it. Is it not unreasonable that that if gold skyrockets in price within the coming decades, fiat Currencies will suffer and cause cryptos to roar? Or maybe the opposite.

Better than taking it from Reddit Shills.

Wow doubling down, how cool. You have to be the biggest fucking tool of all time if you wear a $10k watch on you every single day of your life. Anyone with enough money to comfortably afford one of those, and smart enough to know they actually need one of them wouldn’t need it every single day. You just look like a massive tool that saved his paychecks for 4 years and blew it all on one retarded display of wealth that no one cares about. Congratulations, you played yourself.

That’s what I was alluding to when I referenced people that actually need them. Of fucking course Wall Street Execs would own Rolex’s, they need it to sell home the idea that they are people that deserve respect. You are not a wall street execs. You are a massive petty tool on reddit. And what the fuck was with the shitty caricature Ebonics towards the end? You just sound like a retarded 15 year old white kid.

One of the the articles stated the opposite.
Also you immediately increase the chance of death and robbery through flaunting wealth. This isn’t “muh freedum” it’s common sense.

Why I purposely dress in only the cheapest and most available clothing that I can. You never know who’s down on their luck big time and is just waiting to see some massive idiot walking around in shit they can take in just 5 seconds flat.

It’s basically like $30 a pie, unless they’re less than 14inches each then it was a very reasonable price.

What did people use Bitcoin for before this? Did they use it as like video game currency or something?

German is extremely easy for English speakers, like Spanish is for French speakers. The learning curve for English to German is a lot less than the learning curve to English to Spanish, or even harder English to Mandarin. I’m 50% fluent in German according to duolingo, and native speaking in Spanish so I’m technically trilingual.

I’ve seen a similar proposition in from a Nigerian price in my email inbox.

Well considering it’s completely passive income for the hacker, and easily spread, anything slight is worth it since they have thousands of other computers hacked, I have to fix my old computer because I’m pretty sure it got a remote bitcoin miner on it haha.
