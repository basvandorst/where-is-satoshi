if you're serious about mining then you'll need to relocate

I'm talking about the young dude to beck's left. He's an idiot.    
EDIT: i think beck is an idiot too....

i mine bitcoin (the pools i use merge-mine, so i get some altcoins too). I decommissioned my scrypt rigs last month
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:11:38
vertcoin is filling a need. scrypt asics are killing gpu mining for ltc, etc.    
yacoin tried this too, for cpus. You can see how well that worked out...(i still like YAC)

Yeahhh. Do you think your buddy's landlord might notice if the electric bill increases tenfold?

care to re-comment here next month?    
Will you eat your hat when you're wrong?
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:18:31
No, I'm not suggesting anything. Do whatever you want.    
Here's a suggestion: learn more by yourself before you ask questions here.

are you asking me if I want to move my farm to Ontario? what's the price per kwh? I doubt it's better than what I'm paying
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:18:39
oh, sure! I'll just send you 0.05btc. One sec
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:04:13
no, it's definitely not stabilizing. u/Ashamer is spot on. In three months dogecoin will be a cautionary tale
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:48:24
promoting fraudulent businesses is impolite.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:29:39
yes. I'd never do this at a loss
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:19:53
why does dgc have value? If you say it has value because of the community then you are totally much so 100% wrong.    
Shibes who promote dogecoin that way sound like they're promoting a pyramid scheme.    
A cryptocurrency has value that is directly related to the underlying network and its hashrate. period.

I have an issue with stupidity.    
believing that a site will buy your coins for a PREMIUM and deliver them to PAYPAL is stupid.    
also dogecoin enthusiasts are stupid.    
understand my position?
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:50:31
you are a shill for that site. You're promoting them, and they are clearly dishonest and stealing from uninformed new users.    
    
You are a thief.    
You should be ashamed. You're a bad person :(

miners will migrate to cold climates with low $/kwh. It's always been inevitable
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:43:08
you too??
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:38:58
chips?? That's an unusual question :) I guess I'm "running" 416 chips...
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:19:25
site is shady as fuck
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:48:14
yes!     
If you add the bitcoin network hashrate...
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:19:39
good one!
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:23:00
I'm not trying to discourage you, but asking questions invites trolls. You need to inform yourself. Ask, and research too. Make up your own mind
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:26:01
that kid is a disgrace. Misinformed and misleading :(
