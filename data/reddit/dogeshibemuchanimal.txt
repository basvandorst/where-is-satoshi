Financial Equality = 0.01% of Bitcoiners own 90% lol
I think the normal fiat system is much fairer.
Although I deeply wish this distribution could be fair!
P.S.: Also the majority of the altcoins have this problem. I'm deeply concerned.

The problem that arises are that one or a few of these people could potentially kill the coin by dumping everything. See ripple. Also I feel kinda ripped off by promoting bitcoin with my little to none holdings, while giants get richer.

Hi Kay,
Of course I also have Bitcoin. I mean it was the first (big) cryptocurrency and predecessor, without Dogecoin wouldn't exist today.
Deflation: [Take a look at Japan's Economy.]
But basically with all the deflation Bitcoin would be an asset and Dogecoin a currency!
And best thing: We can have both :) 
Don't worry be happy :) We can coexist (Dogecoin, Bitcoin), help each other and improve each other and depend on each other. Have a nice day
