[Currently, it's nothing more than a "typical" 30-40% drop.]( The market **hasn't decided** if it's more than that. It could be, it could not be. 
BTC has experienced 6 of these in 2017. 
The reason it's dropping so hard is because we just experienced the biggest or 2nd biggest rally of the year (can't be fucked to check). The drop is about 66% of the way to the last drop (I think it was around $5500?) which only occurred in November. It's seeming to have a fair amount of support at 11.5k, but it wouldn't be that surprising to see one last big drop in a healthy recovery.
It dropped because it was staying pretty stagnant around 17-20k and altcoins were booming because of that stagnation. Holding BTC  or any crypto is always a huge risk (as you can see, 50% drop in a couple weeks). Meaning, investors took their money elsewhere. The stagnation indicated that there was little chance for a 20% gain. 
Now that the market is lower again, the chance of a 20% gain (to 14.5k) is a very likely unless it shifts off of its year-long trend. The chance of a 50% gain (to 18k) is a lot more likely vs. prior a 50% gain would have taken us to 30k. 
If we hit a drop of 40%+ dip, we enter unprecedented territories that we haven't experienced since pre-1k levels. Until then, don't be too concerned.

You could be buying at the lowest it will ever be again, you could be buying at the highest it will ever be again. You could be buying at the highest it will be for 3 years. It could be $1k in a year, it could be 10k in a year, it could be 20k in a year, it could be 100k in a year, it could be 500k in a year. **No one knows**
I bought in with $100 in 2013 when it was around ~750. It took around 3 years before my $100 was worth $100 again. Last week, my $100 was worth 2500. Now it's worth $1600 + $244 in BCH (due to fork coins). **Never had an opportunity to cash out with profit for 3 years.** During most of those 3 years, that $100 was worth $20. Are you ready to see your $100 be worth $20 for 3 years? That's one possibility. I personally did not care and wrote it off. That's why it's easy to hold during this period for me - I'm $100 deep - none of the "HEY IT'S 2500" is profit until that money clears my bank account. 
There is no idea what the price will be in a year. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're lying.

It's tempting for me to do the same, but I see it as risk diversification not to. If you always dump a split coin, you're essentially always betting on hard forks to fail. As we saw with Ethereum, hard forks don't always fail. Seeing as you essentially paid nothing for a fork coin, it's "free insurance" anyways.

Are you talking about buying BTC or receiving it from people who already have it? If you're talking about buying BTC with bank funds, the easiest way is via Coinbase even if they **may** have done something scummy recently. 
They've been proven to be reliable for a few years.
If youre talking about receiving already purchased BTC from your neighbor, I'd read the indepth FAQ about wallets and such. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:21
IMO don't bother. I'll attempt to explain after my spiel. 
Holder for 3 years here so let me explain my experiences. So I only invested $100 in 2014. That $100 is worth $2100 now. I mention that because it's **relevant**. 
The only reason I've made money on BTC is because I didn't care about what I invested. Well, initially I did. I thought I had gotten fucked when BTC dropped from $700 to ~$350 in a few weeks. At one point, I was willing to cash out even if I could take a $20 (20%) loss. But it kept going down, down, down. I remember checking at one point and my $100 investment was worth $18. I was like fuck it. $18 is nothing and there's a chance that $100 becomes $300. So I'll left it alone. I chalked that $100 off as a loss and didn't give a fuck what happened to it. These days I look at that initial $100 and acknowledge it's still worth nothing in USD until I cash out for good. 
Had I responded by selling my BTC every time the price was "too high" or "about to crash" or when "bitcoin was going to die" or "when XXX foreign government was going to regulate" or when it was "going to be replaced" etc., I'd probably have gotten out at the wrong time on a few occasions and lost a shitload of money.
The inherent quality of bitcoin that makes it so high reward is the risk associated with it. For instance: if you bought at the all-time high in 2014 (when I did) you had to wait until 2017 for your purchase to be worth what you paid. There's always a chance of that. Like with peak oil, we will never know until we hit peak BTC price. There's also the chance that BTC will 'bottom out' and drop to trivial prices. I'd argue that it'd be fairly unlikely to happen in the near future, but you always carry that risk.
And that's why the earning potential is so great. No one knows how high it will reach. No one knows how low it could drop. 
If you invest money in BTC you have to somehow detach from any potential USD value that money has. You own BTC now. You don't own something earning USD. You own BTC. Let me say it again, you own BTC. That BTC is probably going to go up, it's probably going to go down. It may go down for days, weeks, months, or years at a time. It may never reach the high it once had or the high may double in 2 days. Or the high might be about the same until. 
**Responding to the BTC apocalypse every time it's scheduled to happen will fuck you. *Not responding once may fuck you if it actually happens.*** The determination you have to make here is whether you're going to ignore all fear or react to it. In these periods of fear, it usually drops ~30% and once it's a clear recovery generally shoots back up as quick as it fell. What I'm saying is: it's probably wise to completely ignore these periods. 
*Now for what's happening:*
OK so let's start with the November hard fork (Bcash). The blockchain divided in two at this point. If you held BTC in early november, odds are you have both Bcash and BTC. Bcash has some positive changes in comparison to BTC and some negative changes. For instance, it has lower transaction fees + faster trades. On the negative, it's much more centralized (against the original mantra of BTC) and there seems to be more than a bit of "bad faith" in forcing adoption. The good news is, if you bought prior to November you'll have an equal pool in BTC and BCH. I personally am keeping both just in case. 
The event that triggered this crash is basically that Bcash is now tradable on Gdax. 
The fear circulating at the moment is what's called the "flippening". Basically, BTC was the first Crypto to gain traction. There are a bunch of competing cryptos, some of which have better features. Hypothetically, there could be a crypto that will "supercede BTC". Just like you have "THE US GOVERNMENT WILL COLLAPSE OVERNIGHT" doomsdayers, you have the same with BTC - ie "BTC WILL DIE!". 
So your options? You can either respond to this and respond to every other "THIS IS THE END OF BTC" event or you can just wait out the storm. If you choose to wait out the storm, there's a chance the storm eventually biblical. If you abandon ship each time, odds are you miss out on the best earning periods (higher risk = higher returns). Because basically, a bunch of people will sell out of fear and then when it recovers try to get back in - thus driving up the price.

If you go with the peak of 20,000 a 40% dip would be to 12,000. We passed that, but not by much. We did reach 10,500, which yes would put us at a 47.5% dip. Which is the **biggest dip of the post 1500 BTC.** 


By that I didn't mean 41%, 42%, etc., I meant a fair bit more than that (like 50%+). Considering that at one point the largest dip was 33% and 31% and then we had a 40% dip, I don't think a 43-47% dip is all that much worse. 50% would be though, because that means we're trending towards a 66% dip vs a 33% dip. 
While 10500 was the true bottom on Gdax, but that also didn't last long. Bitstamp has the top at 19,600 and bottom at 11,200. So, for shits and giggles let's instead say 19.6k peak, 11.2k bottom. That puts it at 42.85% vs the previous high dip of 40%. Must more within reason. 
My cop out answer? 20k was an emotional target. And it's possible I'm making an emotional argument here and ignoring the data, but I think the market overly pushed for that barrier. The market was already showing resistance at 16-17k prior to that. [(look at the chart here and you might see my point)]( Hypothetically let's say the peak demand was actually 16k-17k.
* 16k drop = 11.2k
* 16k drop = 9.6k
* 17k @ 30% drop = 11.9k 
* 17k @ 40% drop = 10.2k. 
So my argument is we basically had a double dip in regards to 20k coming back to earth and the 16-17k dip that was building. 
And 10k is a bit of an emotional point as well (which could put additional sell-pressure). If we went under it, we'd be back to 4 digits.
So basically, 20k is the perfect overly enthusiastic buy target and &lt;10k is the overly pessimistic sell target. The other "big" 40% dip flirted with 5K and 2.5k. 
Now let me be clear: that's ABSOLUTELY moving the goalposts, adding a subjective component, and redefining the rules of a pure data set to be overly optimistic. 
But regardless, ignore my cop out. This is indeed the biggest 1.5k+ BTC crash at 43%-47%. I'll be getting real concerned if it does validate that 10.5k crash again - especially if LTC and ETH don't follow.

Lots of indepth tutorials on wallet/wallet apps. Google that. I havent had my BTC in a wallet for a while now, so I don't want to give you dated info. 
Best way to cheaply sell BTC and avoid the $20+ transaction fees that sometimes pop up is to transfer it to coinbase, buy LTC, and sell LTC. You do take on some inherent market risk in doing-so. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:33:28
[To be fair, this drop was the biggest percentage wise]( (which is all that matters) in 2017. If you go with Gdax high/lows, it was a 47.5% drop from 20k to 10.5k. If you with Bitstamps, it was a 43% drop from 19.6k to 11.2k 
Or to put it another way.
A 40% dip is ~33% higher than a 30% dip. A 47% dip is ~66% higher than a 30% dip.

 How bout this one 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:00
OK so let me reword that. I explained it pretty shittily because it's complex. Let's say you receive BTC and want to immediately convert it to cash. 
If you have BTC you need to transfer it to Gdax (your customer could directly send it to your Gdax/Coinbase wallet too), which DOES have a fee to transfer the BTC from your/their wallet to Gdax's wallet (aka the bitcoin network/mining fee). The sender pays the fee and you cant get out of THAT transfer fee no matter what. 
From there, you can sell the BTC on the Gdax exchange (instead of selling directly to coinbase). It'll give you a USD balance that's ON the exchange. This can be used to purchase/sell LTC/ETH/BCH/BTC.
I mentioned transferring it to LTC without explaining much. That comes into play if you want to move between exchanges cheaply (for other altcoins). You're best off converting it to LTC and depositing that on an exchange with more altcoin support. Eventually if you want to cash out of an altcoin, you convert it to LTC, send it to gdax, then you sell the LTC there and have fiat. If you do that directly with BTC you'd pay a much larger fee to transfer amongst the network. 
There MIGHT be an exchange that does it without the middleman LTC support, but I've only used Gdax due to the MTGox bullshit years ago. 
But let's say you receive BTC and just want to get that USD off coinbase/gdax: you need to pay (I think) a $25 wire transfer fee. 
So basically.. let's say you sell a muffin for BTC. The buyer of the muffin pays a transaction fee to send you the BTC (let's say you use your coinbase wallet).  If you want to immediately hop out of crypto after the sale, you can do-so via Gdax. Now, if you want USD in your bank account you have to pay a flat wire fee to unload it your total balance. (Also hint: it's not worth it for a small purchase like a muffin)
LTC is basically your gateway to transfer BTC to other non-gdax supported crypto exchanges (which should have a fairly trivial &lt;$2 fee). That's why I mentioned it. 
To reiterate:
Your customer will always pay a transaction fee to send you BTC. At the moment, it's fairly high (For a quick transfer, it's $15-25 I think). 
A flat $25 wire transfer (if I recall) is necessary to get USD out of the exchange after you sell the crypto for fiat. It's fine to be sitting there indefinitely (but again, a risk if Coinbase goes under like MTGox did). 
1. If you plan on dabbling in altcoins, you'd be best having the customer send it directly to an altcoin exchange wallet.
2. If you plan on immediately converting to USD, you'd be best having them send it to a gdax wallet. 
3. If you plan on only dealing in ETH/LTC/BTC/BCH you'd be best having them send it to a gdax wallet. 
The LTC "trick" is only necessary when you are doing 1. 
Also you probably don't want to use BTC unless you're dealing in large transactions. At the moment, $15-25 fees really kill its instrumentality for low-value transactions.

Background is in accounting and I understand BTC fairly well. Assuming he does some very illegal things, they can't prove shit honestly EDIT: If he is meticulous and flawless. The burden of proof is on them to prove he has it/had it during the divorce. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING I LISTED HERE AS IT'S VERY VERY ILLEGAL AND COULD RESULT IN TIME IN JAIL** . But in theory here's how people could launder money via BTC (and why the government really sees BTC as a threat in money launders/drug trade). Also, future money laundering techniques will make future Breaking Bad a very very boring show, because there is no need for a carwash or chicken. 
1. Buy some pumped/overvalued altcoin on an exchange tied to your actual personal information.
2. Scrub the alt coin (basically makes it untraceable)
3. Move the scrubbed altcoin to another exchange with fake personal info. Sell the altcoin at a similar BTC cost. Rebuy a more valuable coin (like BTC/ETH/LTC/Monero) with the now untraceable fund and put it in a wallet (meaning, you're out very little - albeit susceptible to a huge crash when you're between cryptos).  We'll call this "hidden BTC". 
4. Wait for alt-coin to crash
5. Buy a shitload of crashed altcoin post-crash.
6. Move the same number of the altcoin back to exchange with your personal info.
7. Sell alt-coin at a huge loss and put the low proceeds back into bank. You now have your "loss" and your "hidden BTC". Tell wife you lost a shitload of money on crypto to ensure she files for divorce. 
8. If asked about it by lawyer, say you were investing in crypto and due to the divorce you divested as you'd be incurring more expenses with a single income. 
On the books, it looks like you bought an altcoin on an exchange, moved it out of your wallet, moved the same number of alt coins back to your wallet, and divested at a huge capital loss. In actuality, you only held the altcoin for a brief period of time and sold it right after. 
The next problem is that you now have a bunch of BTC you need to legitimize.
1. Post-divorce, buy a few mining rigs and set up an LLC. 
2. Use said mining rigs to mine whatever the fuck ICOs you want.
3. Wait until a coin that originated AFTER the divorce moons. It might not be the coin you mined, but that doesn't matter.
4. Calculate a reasonable number of coins you COULD have mined with the mining power you had. 
5. Use your "hidden BTC" to buy some alt coins and put it into a wallet. Scrub and transfer to another wallet. Ideally, do it in multiple transactions so you aren't as susceptible to a flash crash. 
6. Deposit alt coin onto an exchange and sell (an exchange outside of the US' jurisdiction would make it a shitload easier). Claim this as LLC profit from your 100% legit mining operation. Pay your fucking taxes. Make sure there's no way to prove you mined XYZ coin instead of PROFIT coin. 
7. Don't be stupid. Live to your prior living standards for years after. If you must flaunt your wealth, wait until you have a justification to do-so (ie a job promotion). Tell all your workers about your LLC. Establish a history before you suddenly become rich.
8. Don't mention what you did to a single fucking soul. Whether it be your drinking buddies, family, or reddit. Everyone has a price. Someone could tip off the wife for a small percentage of her legal ruling. Not only would you risk losing the money, but now you also committed felonious money laundering. 
EDIT: Thought I'd add, I've never tried doing this before because I'm not involved in criminal activity (else I wouldn't have posted on my main account or even on an alt account). If someone has further insight as to why this wouldn't work, feel free to chime in. I'm basing my information solely on my experience with the crypto market + my knowledge of how US money laundering cases. I'm moreso sharing this theory to educate people on the very real reason governments/banks fear crypto. 
EDIT2: Also thought I'd do this for fun
LIST OF CRIMINAL YOU PROBABLY WOULD COMMIT in addition to more: Tax evasion **multiple times**, even if you do pay taxes on the final product (because you didn't claim gains/losses on the exchange of alt-coins). Failure to disclose assets (to both the IRS and to the courts during the divorce). Perjury (at minimum, to the divorce lawyer). Conspiracy. And of course, money laundering. Potential identity theft laws in the foreign country which you use the exchange. Not to mention, the not criminal civil laws.

LTC dropped from 374 to 150 (60%). 
ETH dropped from 850 to 463 (45.5%).
BCH dropped from ~3600 (let's be fair and not use the Gdax price and instead what it had been trading at on other more established exchanged) to 1600. (55%). 
Yet BTC is "dip coin" because it dropped from 20k to 10.5k (52.5%)? 
Assuming it's over (which it may not be) LTC and BCH both had bigger dips in a similar time period.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:02
Take your pick: Gdax added BCH to their exchange. Roger Ver went on CNBC to trash it. BTC just had a huge rally. Lots of money had been being pumped into altcoins (and thus made those investments seem more favorable than a stagnant BTC).

Couldn't someone just sell for USD then buy BTC for USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:30
I posted a longer post [cause that's what I do].. 
It costs nothing to convert USD/BTC/BCH/LTC/ETH once the moneys already on Gdax (as long as you use limit orders and not the market buy/sell). 
To get USD/BTC/BCH/LTC/ETH onto Gdax, it costs the transaction fee (which the person paying you would have to pay). BTC is the long-and-far the worst offender ($6-25 usually, at peak $50) when it comes to transaction fees. ETH/BCH are ~$0.60 and is generally less, but currently has ~$1.20 fees. 
Transferring to LTC is only instrumental when you wish to move between exchanges. 
To get money off of Gdax/another exchange you have a flat wire transfer fee ($25 at the moment). If you'd pool together a month of transactions, youd still pay the same flat fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:21
Nope, it's a direct buyer-to-seller market. Let's assume you, I, and OP's mother are the only three participants. You have 2 coins, both for sale. OP's mother puts a buy order up for $15,000, I put a buy order up for $10. If you sell both coins, you'd net $15,010. 
In case of someone selling 100k BTC? If that happened all in a moments notice the entire market/value of BTC would be fuckkkked in the short term. At the moment, even 12k BTC being instasold on Gdax would tank the price down to $4500. Hard to say if the market would eat up the cheap BTC or if it'd trigger a panic sell. Odds are, someone with 100k BTC probably would more likely constantly unload their coins over a larger window of time. Whether it be few weeks, months, or year. 
Think of it like this. Let's say I have 5000 BTC. If I were to instantly dump them all currently, I'd net around $74m according to the current chart. If, instead of dumping them slowly I let them go at market value ($~17.2k at the moment) I can instead get $74m from 4,300 BTC. Leaving me 700 more BTC (12m) more than dumping.  
If you're curious, that information is displayed in [this chart]( on Gdax. It's literally a chart of all the buy/sell orders.

Depends on the extent of his actions. If he knowingly had MtGox operating on a fractional reserve with the knowledge that there were missing coins, definitely.

He'll likely face a US criminal investigation as well, even if he never set foot on US soil while operating MtGox. 
If Karpeles continued to operate MtGox after he knew the bitcoins were missing, he essentially was committing fraud. I wouldn't be surprised if this guy ends up in the same cell as Madoff. 
Remember: Japan is a puppet of the US, he'd easily face deportion.

@_date: 2014-02-27 13:11:28
Observer here. Not really involved in the BTC community, but I am following the Gox thing unfold. Assuming all 700k+ BTC are gone, unfortunately, there is no way you'll ever see that money again. 
Even if it is somehow magically recovered, it will be frozen and held by the feds for quite some time. I'm talking 2-3 years, minimum. 
Seeing as MtGox's official twitter/site has been completely wiped from the internet, they have likely entered damage control. Not even just for the company, but for their own freedom. 
Face it. The US government sees BTC as a threat and will do anything to hammer those to the wall supporting it. Any charges they can place on those involved with BTC will happen, if they have a chance.
It's looking more and more likely that MtGox has known about the losses for quite some time. Meaning, they have been operating completely unethically with exchanges of like-kind exchanges of currency. If MtGox called MtGox a financial exchange, operated like a financial exchange, and their customers thought it was a financial exchange, the courts will probably view them as a financial exchange, too.
If the officers in charge of MtGox were operating an exchange for months with the knowledge that there was no assets backing the commodity they were trading, that's quite frankly fraud. 
So back to that "it's unlikely you'll ever receive your BTC back even if they're recovered."
At this point, I'd be damn near certain that MtGox has destroyed every back-up of their hard drives. If this is the case, there is no evidence on who owns what bitcoin. If they haven't destroyed the said evidence, they're fucking idiots.

It depends on the mood I'm in. Sometimes I'll post a single or couple line response if I have only a little to say, but if you look through my comment history you'll notice that my comments are significantly longer than the average redditor. I do have other accounts, but I post the majority of my comments on this account now. The only reason I'm ever on one of my other accounts is by accident or to respond to a comment reply (and then I forget to log-out, creating a never-ending mailbox).
This account wasn't created to be a novelty, just more of a tendency I have developed. However, I have realized that it does somewhat cause me to write longer comments in general. I have fun with it though.

I think this is correct, but feel free to offer a correction ha ha ha.
So BTC has price trends. Occasionally, the trends get a little out of hand, but traders play into them anyways or they miss the opportunity for profit over time.
A correction is literally the correction of "out of hand" pricing. Sometimes it's due to a media piece (IE Times publishes an article praising BTC as the new gold), sometimes it's due to a fork (which doubles your BTC into an alt coin), mathematically speaking, it's just a safer trendline. Those are both temporary increases in demand that need to be filtered out down the line.
IE, because of a Time magazine piece there might be 5% more new players buying it blindly. Eventually that wears off and grandmas stop higher-than-normal prices. Thus the correction subtracts out over

Don't make the mistake I did. Started with 0.135 BTC that I only played $100 for. Let it sit for a long time, did nothing, and it was worth around $300. 
I figured "hey free $300, im going to fuck around with the market." That day I was up ~0.01 BTC (only a few bucks at the time). Next day I fucked around with it again. Lost most of what I gained, but I still was ahead. No harm no foul, I always buy in at the right time - right?
See up until then I was in a bear market. Bear markets are easier to handle (IMO) if you're OK keeping your investment. It goes down, so you can always back in. It seems obvious, but I didn't think of the flip side of the equation.
That's when it happened. I was up 0.02 BTC doing awesome. All of a sudden the price changed and it went way up on me. Bought in during a boom then fucked up and sold it when it dropped again. Then it went up again.
Went from .137 to .130 BTC in a day. Doesn't seem like much, but 0.007*7250 = $50.75. 
A few days ago, I decided that the current level was unsustainable, I'm up $950, and might as well get out or buy back in if it tanked. I had second guesses once I hopped out. Got out at 7080. See it going up like crazy the last few days and told myself if it hit 7080 I'd buy back in.
Plans changed. I bought LTC. That was going fairly well (I went from $920 to $960 day trading). Then the crash happened. Paniced again with a few bad trades and was at one point down to $912 (from $960). 
At the end of the day, I decided to buy back into BTC. I only have 0.127 BTC now. That's 15% less than I'd have had if I just left it the fuck alone.
Oh well, you live you learn.

It's a hilariously good time or extremely bad time to invest at the moment. I'd wait it to settle down a bit over the next week and establish a baseline. Hard to know if it'll be 6600, 5500, or 3000. 
You might miss on a quick 14% gain (assuming a jump to previous high), but it's better than a 33%-66% loss.

I love Bitcoin, but that's terrible advice and I really hope you're holding most of your income in BTC. Look all the way back to 2013. After peaking over a short period of time to ~1000, it crashed for almost 3 years. I had put $100 in it back then and remember thinking "well that's $100 I'll never see again" when it hit $30. Thankfully, I let it sit for 4 years. 
Let me put it like this. We're climbing a mountain and we don't know what's on the other side. Does it keep going up forever? Is there a large valley that might take years or decades to cross? 
That crash might not come ever. If it does, we really have no clue how short or long it'll be. 
Take note of the 2007-2008 recession. People lost a lifetime of savings because they kept all of their money in investments and were living on little savings. If they withdrew from their 401k, they were pretty much taking out 50 cents on the dollar. Now imagine having a big expense today that you have to pay for in BTC (broken car, car accident, medical bills, etc.,). That's what your rainy day fund in the bank is for. 
Sure the stock market might have lower returns, but at the market rate a teenager/young adult can become a millionaire with only $100/month for a couple decades. BTC should supplement that + healthy savings.

I bought .135 for $100 on the tail of the first crash.
Wasn't even trying to invest, was actually using it to get a discount on a $50 purchase and was like "well hell, I'll throw $50 in to invest too!".
By the time I got access to the BTC, it was worth only like $70. So I was like "well that $4 discount is now more like a $-30 discount." So I was like screw it, I'll let it sit in my account and see what comes of it. Eventually just accepted that I'd never see that $100 again. Getting out for $10-20 wasn't worth trying to figure out my password so I said fuck it.
Randomly checked one day and sure enough it's over $1000. Said fuck it, let's see how high this can go. Ignored it again. Then I realize that I have like $450 sitting randomly on coinbase. 
If BTC zeroes, I don't care. I already let go of that $100 long ago. At this point, it's just humourous seeing magic money in my account.

Words out of someone who invested at $100 at $700 and saw that BTC being worth $200. I've held the majority of the time. 
From my observation, big dumps usually happen in multiple stages. We saw the crash and subsequent recovery. From my observation, the recovery usually happens over a few days and settles midway between the peak and first big recovery, like a sine wave getting smaller. It's certainly possible this is the end of the crash. If it is, we'll likely see similar prices for a few more days. Thus OP stands to lose little potential BTC by waiting out the next 48 hours (maybe 4-6%). 
By buying now, he'll likely see at max a 5% gain in the next few days. By waiting, he can minimize the chance that this isn't the end of the crash (a 30-60% loss). Even if it recovers to pre-crash levels in the next 3 days, that's only a 15% gain. 
People with little experience (like myself the first time I bought) are sometimes too greedy and try to buy at what they think is a super duper low. But if you lack knowledge, you'd be better to buy on a slight upward trend that's already in place (like in september). Just remember: these crashes are subsidized by people trying to make a quick buck and panic selling when they dont. My assumption is that the first "recovery" is usually overly optimistic and people buy in too quick when they see it jump.

He's saying that you can no longer reasonably make day-to-day transactions with BTC due to fees and transaction time.

It's actually a fairly good plan by them. 
They saw the 7400 as the peak of a curve. Add on top of that Segwit. It allows them to double dip on a scale of epic proportions. They knew that if they popped the bubble one of two things happens A. Bitcoin recovers, B. Bitcoin dies. They hedged their bets (as they do with sell high/buy low). 
They had a fuckton of miners mine BCH. If BCH succeeds they make a fuckload. If BCH fails they can pump and dump. 
So they divest a mass amount of bitcoin at a predictable peak (Segwit fork). They know they can always get back in the game and know that once the fork was called off people would sell anyways. They also invest a fair amount in BCH knowing it's the agenda they'll push. 
Doesn't matter which pony wins, as they own both of them. They have the ability to tank BCH if necessary. And they have the ability of knowing when the high sell was and can buy in low at any point they really want.

Below that I'm seeing support levels of 5200ish, 4400, and [hopefully not] 3300?

Let's say the algorithm is predicting a ceiling price of $6300. The bot starts buying up coins at cheaper prices.
Highest volume traders don't pay fees, so it's a good way for them to buy at the average price over X period of time instead of putting a single buy order in. Also makes the market seem more stable due to not shifting the curve as much.

There will be a flash crash at 6400 to 6080 soon OR over the next 3 hours it'll peak at 6700, collapse to 6300, momentarily rise to 6444, then collapse to 6050 to 6000. Mark my word. Or maybe i'll be wrong ;)

Let me tell you a story.
In 2014 (the first over 1000 boom) I bought $100 USD of BTC at ~740 each. The economy was crashing. I was actually planning to the majority of it for a transaction and planned to keep a few dollars in it just in case shit got cray cray. By the time payment info was exchanged, BTC had further crashed to ~450 and I was ~$20 short of my purchase.
I was pretty pissed because the seller was extremely slow and kind of fucked me, but oh well. Shit happens. I said I'd wait a few weeks and divest. So I let the .135 sit. 
1 year goes by - in that year I never had an opportunity to make my $$$ back. 2 years goes by. I check and it's worth only $33 and I'm pretty sure I'm fucked. At that point, I let go all hope of ever seeing that $100 again. 
In summer of 2016 I had an opportunity to sell it and lose only a few bucks, but fuck that. Not doing it. If it recovered from 250-700 once it'll do it again. 
After that, it was just steady gains. Now I'm sitting with ~$878 with .128 of the original .135 I bought. 
As for this drop? I'd say it's pretty significant. If you invested at the peak (7500-7700) it could be a while or never. 
In 8 months it's gone up almost $6000 per coin. If the bull trend continues, I'd expect you to be profiting in ~3-4 months minimum. 
Moral of the story? Be patient.

I had a few fuckups this week, but ultimately came out ahead on BTC and am only down a few bucks (think I started at .1302 BTC  during the peak and ended up with 883/.1366). A couple times I sold right before dips. A couple times I sold quickly after a few dips and bought back in high. Honestly, I prefer playing the short-term market vs. long term. Worst I was at was .125 BTC and worst I was at was 808 USD. 
I'm kind of at a crossroads. If BTC recovers to sustainable gains I'll stick with it. If not, I might cash out. So I try to balance total BTC and USD. IE, if I sell and BTC takes off I'll buy back in and hope I make it back up later. 
I actually kind of predicted the crash a few days prior, but bought back in when it started skyrocketing as I'm pretty sentimental about having my .1302+ BTC. 
EDIT: I realized I didn't answer your question. Here are my most recent buy/sells (yes I lost on some of them and would have been better waiting). Bought at 5759.33, sold at 6025.01. Bought at 6100.0. Sold at 6269.9. Bought at 6269.89 (mistake). Sold at 6050.72. Bought at 6001.
