I've never read the book, so I didn't realize the people thing was just added in the film.  I'll have to add it to my reading list.
Obviously, nobody is going to actually think it contains ground up old people.  For me, the problem with the name is the imagery it brings up.  When I first heard of this product it conjured up an image in my mind of a dystopian future where food is incredibly scarce, and our only hope is Charleton Heston (shudder).  There's no actual harm to using the name "Soylent", but when you're marketing a product you typically want the name to have positive connotations.  For me, "Soylent" has very negative connotations.

It may indeed be worth more in the future, but that's meaningless to someone who doesn't already care about Bitcoin.  If you give something that is currently worthless to someone, and you tell them "it will be much more valuable in a year", they're going to laugh in your face.  Giving tips that are perceived to be worthless by the recipient is only going to be looked at as irritating noise.

You're making assumptions about me based on zero information.  I didn't say anything about Bush v. Gore.  I'm simply asking you to provide some actual evidence for the claim you're making.  Telling me to "go read it on the internet" is ridiculous.  Anyone can find claims to support any pet theory on the internet, but evidence is what I'm asking for.
If you can only reply with insults when asked to provide evidence to support your claim, then you're just another conspiracy theorist as far as I'm concerned.  You've already taken the time to rant at me about how uninformed I am, so why not take a few more minutes to cough up some links that actually support what you're saying?

When it says it's only been confirmed by 1 peer, it basically means it never made it out to the rest of the bitcoin network.

This happens all the time, and the results are altcoins.  They aren't all carbon copies of bitcoin, but most of them are almost identical in how they work.  The value of bitcoin comes from the consensus among its users of how valuable they all agree it should be.

I know Coinbase has instant buy.  However, the process to get verified is incredibly frustrating and time consuming, or at least it was when I did it.  OP's complaint is that there is too much of a barrier to entry, and Coinbase's arduous verification process doesn't help at all.  Circle, on the other hand, has a very painless process to get set up with instant buys.  Hopefully, this competition will push Coinbase towards a getting started experience that's more user friendly.

From what I hear about MtGox (I've never used them), you got lucky in that MultiBit didn't correctly send the transaction onto the network.  That's what the "seen by one peer" status means.  To get the "missing" BTC you may need to export your wallet's private keys to a newly created wallet, and they should reappear.  Once you get access to your BTC again, DO NOT send it to MtGox.  Use any of the other exchanges.  I would recommend Electrum as a better wallet than MultiBit.

Do you really believe non-GMO crops don't require any pesticides?  In fact, some types of genetically modified crops require fewer pesticides.  I think you might be confusing genetic modification with monoculture, which is completely different.  Monoculture crops may require more pesticides because they lack biodiversity, but that has nothing to do with GMO.


This would only be true if the GMO crop has traits that give it an adaptive edge of the native crop.  The GMO crop usually dies out quickly when it gets out into the wild, since it's only able to thrive in specific conditions.

Until I see some extraordinary evidence to back it up I'm going to assume the more likely explanation, which is that she's fucking bonkers (That's a medical term).

Whole Foods exclusively employs post graduate self important hipsters, so that won't be a problem.
FYI, they don't just stock organic foods.  They have most of the conventional foods you would see at any other grocery store, although I wish they would come to their senses and stop selling "homeopathic" shit.  A lot of what they sell is more expensive, but some of it is actually cheaper, and their customer service is incredible.

100 bits is worth about 4 cents.  There's a threshold below which receiving a "tip" is just an annoyance, especially to someone who isn't already interested in Bitcoin.   For me, that threshold would be something on the order of a dollar.  If you want to give tips to people on other subreddits who probably don't use Bitcoin yet, it should be a minimum of about 2000 bits (2 mBTC).  Anything less will just irritate people.

You sure gave the impression that you were saying that.
It takes a very big logical leap to go from saying something reasonable like "the government is not trustworthy" to saying something crazy like "the government is trying to give everyone autism through vaccines".  The second statement requires actual credible evidence, of which there is none.  Believe what you like, but when someone with a large audience like Alex Jones says this sort of shit, it does actual harm to a lot of people.  There have actually been recent outbreaks of whooping cough (resulting in many deaths) as a result of people preventing their kids from getting vaccinated for fear that it causes autism.  People like Alex Jones continue to perpetuate myths like this that are genuinely dangerous, and the scary part is that people listen to him.

I really like the measures you're taking with security, but I'm still not really comfortable storing a significant amount of money with Coinbase.  I need to know that I will still have control of my coins if:
* Coinbase unexpectedly goes down or somehow ceases to exist.
* Authorities attempt to force Coinbase to freeze my holdings. (I have no intentions of committing any crimes, but this is a matter of principle.)
If you can guarantee that the two cases above are covered, I will become a big Coinbase advocate.

I'm strongly in favor of legalizing all drugs, but saying that doctors are drug dealers is just plain stupid.  The goal of a doctor is to improve the health of a patient.  The goal of a drug dealer (legal or illegal) is to sell their product at a profit.  Sometimes these two goals align, they are two very different things.

I think the appeal is that it allows you to spend Bitcoin at any merchant, regardless of whether they accept it or even know about it.  Ideally, this will become unnecessary once all merchants start accepting Bitcoin, but there's a long way to go before we get there.

That's how HD wallets are meant to work.  Each address is derived from previous addresses, so you should never need to use the same address twice.  The old addresses are still part of your wallet, but only the newest one gets shown.

mBTC is short for milli-BTC, or a thousandth of a bitcoin.  To convert between mBTC and BTC just move the decimal point three places to either multiply or divide by 1000.

@_date: 2014-10-01 16:55:05
I'm saying that, from the perspective of people who want to cause as much fear and panic as possible, it was a success.

The article you link doesn't contain a single mention of Reddit or the new (or old) CEO.  Care to back up your claim with actual evidence?
@_date: 2014-05-19 04:24:21


It was Jan 2001.

What have they done that you find disgusting?
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:46:27
I've submitted two help requests, and each time I got an email response from a human being within a day.  However, the issues have yet to be resolved.  This is still a huge improvement compared to Coinbase's support.

Removal of spam is not censorship.  When more than half of the new threads are all basically the same post, that's spam.  Letting the sub get overrun with noise isn't helping anybody.

No.  What is the drill?  Are we supposed to hijack his AMA with Bitcoin comments?
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:16:07
It still seems very amateurish.  Handwritten text on an official piece of currency just makes bitcoin look like the school project of someone who can't get the word out any other way.
Also remember this is 'Murica, so crossing out "God" and replacing it with "Math" is bound to be offensive to many.  I'm personally all in favor of removing "God" from printed money, but I'm in the minority.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:39:32
Please explain why.
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:41:36
Once you export the private key of the wallet, you should probably stop using it.  I think this is a bug in MultiBit, so you might want to use something else.  [Electrum]( has worked well for me.
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:54:31
Who cares?
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:28:03


They sort of are the only way to easily buy bitcoins in the US.

When you post simething like this, you had damn well better provide a source.  Otherwise, you're going to get crucified on this sub, and rightly so.

They don't owe you anything.
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:24:31
The fact that nobody here seems to have heard about this before seems like a bit of a red flag to me.  When/how are you going to start getting the word out?
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:45:50
I can deal with most of the fees, but the $4.95 monthly fee is fucking insane.
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:24:34
Is it as buggy as the Android version?

Why would it be a problem for Bitcoin?

What problems have you had with Circle and Coinbase?  They're both pretty reliable.
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:55:01
Did you send it to an address that's in use, or did it go into the void?  If it's an address that someone owns, you could send another very small transaction with a message attached explaining the situation.
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:41:56
Yes, I did.

When you tag a post as NSFW, you had damn well better deliver some nudity!

The "good news" is that the number of people who say they are likely to buy bitcoins (18%) is significantly higher than the percentage of people who have already bought bitcoins (~3%).  This suggests that Bitcoin adoption isn't anywhere near being maxxed out.
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:45:34
As far as I know, btcaddr.es isn't decentralized, and you cannot change your address once you've created an alias.

Don't you mean "bitcom"?

I had the same thing happen, even after I tried to reset the blockchain.  I ended up exporting the private keys from that wallet to a new wallet, and the correct balance reappeared in the new one.

"None of the above" probably shouldn't be the first of four possible answers.  Otherwise, I like it.
