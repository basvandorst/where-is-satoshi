id rather use an online service so that other people can manage it too. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:49:13
Except in Ecuador we use the american dollar
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:22:54
well yes, im not even the finance person im just the idea person. So id give it back to that person once it was set up. So did you say not to use coinbase?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:17:40
CEO of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:00:40
ah there we go. I had a personal coinbase account would you recommend on as well for an organization?
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:18:19
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:58:49
well there will only be two people running that finances. so how would blockchain work then
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:27:50
libertarians disgust me soo much 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:01:20
No queer is different, its a sort of catch all for the other letters and also includes a more active, political, grassroots approach. At least thats the idea
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:19:11
These are like the gag headlines from simcity lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:03:54


thanks for posting. I can read a bit of it from learning german. lol
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:40:45
Yes the concept seems to b the same.
@_date: 2013-09-12 00:22:40
Ill take one. Can I pay the shipping in btc
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:26:40
well im sure the prices will go down the question is how high will it go before it goes down. If prices go up to 500 and i didnt buy at 350 ill be a fool
@_date: 2013-08-31 00:59:13
can we have one on Wednesday and maybe in SF?
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:39:35
Solar charger?
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:05:29
why would ppl buy from Local bitcoins instead of directly from coinbase or something
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:09:08
i thought he was gonna buy a subway fare with bitcoin. Now that would be exciting 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:02:32
huh that makes no sense
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:15:37
im not sure that chart is accurate how is it prices have kept steadily rising, in fact merchant themselves tell you that prices raise a couple of pennies a day
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:26:07
thanks for that, ill give it a try
@_date: 2013-08-30 01:26:39
I lived through the dolarization it was very contentious. It made everything crazy expensive and inflation was not stopped was the governments hope. Prices are getting closer to American prices but we very low salaries. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:39:07
well i can afford to lose 25 bucks, im sure itd be better then the while i had one share of Ford and 2 shares of citibank
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:02:03
its not so much being scared as to the fact that i am broke. If invested the 500 dollars i have and it goes sour then id have no emergency money. Emergency money is good have. What exchange do you recommend 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:49:04
ah thats smart
@_date: 2013-10-15 05:59:07
just food
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:12:25
just think about how desperate we are as a population when food makes us go this crazy. These people werent buying TV or phones. they were buying basic human needs, we are so starved in one way or another that we go crazy when we can have free food. That says something really sad about our society
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:05:57
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:13:10
hmm well im rather socially akward, the idea of meeting up with someone in a dark park is scary. How would you do it?
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:56:25
well youll have to tutor me on this cause i got no idea
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:28:24
no, this is just speculative right now i cant even afford to have a place to live but soon enough i should have something to invest by then i should hope to have a better idea of if doing this as an investment is a good idea or not.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:11:04
i just dont want to give my checking account number to have them drain my measly savings. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 01:54:26
well i couldnt imagine a better way to spend empty time then making some coins
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:27:27
thanks for the answer believe it or not its more math then is easy for me to do. I have worked with large currency numbers as i lived in Ecuador during the sucre period but ive never really had to look at more then to two digits to establish a price. In terms of research what exactly do you mean, i hope its more then just learn how to divide the coin
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:01:25
what exchange do you recommend 
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:58:09
Like .05 usd
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:28:04
But if I have a phone and it's idle in my pocket won't it contribute at least something instead of just sitting there
@_date: 2013-09-12 02:12:26
I hope ive made enough btc to cover shipping
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:58:41
Its not surveys its tasks I got it from the getting started link in the subreddit
@_date: 2013-10-15 05:59:54
if food were plentiful and easy for everyone to have then there wouldnt be this issue. To me this just shows a larger systemic issue.
