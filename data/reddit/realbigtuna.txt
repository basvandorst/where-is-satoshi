Thats the tough part. Its easy to quantify the energy used for mining, because its just one metric. Much harder to quantify for Fiat because you have so many areas of energy consumption to look at. For example, how do you quantify the energy used by consumers traveling to and from the bank/atm to withdraw funds? Its a common sense argument that the total energy expended in printing and distributing fiat is significantly higher than that of btc, although much harder to quantify.

Hiring a firm to manage and diversify your portfolio with some crypto exposure in some capacity. Not everyone wants to (or has time) to manage their own money.

If you have no job skills, no history of demonstrable work ethic, how can you move up the job ladder? If UBI provides you with water, food, etc, how will you have money left over to engage in entrepreneurship? In order to pay for UBI, you'd have to tax. If you create an entrepreneurial enterprise, and are then taxed at a high level, increasing the difficulty in re-investing in your business, wouldn't fewer people succeed?
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:39:41

Governments can fund wars overseas through printing money. By printing money, they do not need to seek the approval of the public to fund war. The public ends up paying for a war they did not consent to engaging in with interest on top. In addition, the money they previously held is now worth less due to the increase in supply as a result of the same printing. Every taxpaying US citizen gets screwed by this every single day. Those on the lower end of the income distribution get screwed the hardest due to being the most impacted by devaluation of currency. 
Another example, the bank bailout. Money was printed to bail out the banks without the consent of the public.

Moved off Coinbase to Gemini about 6 months ago after a bad support issue with Coinbase. No complaints so far, other than being offline for 8 hours a few weeks ago (coinbase was offline too). Other than that, I'd say its been stable. You can deposit more than $500/day if you use a wire transfer. For the daily bank deposits, although its a low limit, they make your deposit available to trade immediately which is nice.

Other jobs will always be created to fill the gap. Human innovation will naturally shift to create value in other areas. Whether its entertainment, art, science, etc. The same rules will apply. Develop a valuable skill set or be at the bottom of the economic barrel. A UBI simply ensures that bottom rung is larger. Keep in mind, for the sake of this argument, I'm assuming a UBI takes the form of currency. If you provide basic food/water/shelter, and thats literally it, I don't think it would be an issue and would support that.

Creating your own ISP is far more complicated than simply founding a charity. The legal agreements these ISP's have with governments guarantee them a monopoly or duopoly in a lot of cases. They have also been granted ownership of the infrastructure in a lot of cases as well. Comcast has shit customer service, but in terms of censoring or throttling connections, none of the ISPs have done us any wrong to this point. The tech giants like Facebook, Google, Twitter on the other hand, have been censoring content to an ever increasing extent. Our focus should be on these providers at the moment.

Actually, thinking about this, if you removed the minimum wage, and replaced it with a UBI, you may spur job growth at the lower rungs. It would then become valuable to hold any job to boost your income and job skills, so long as the UBI isn't taken away the more money you earn (which would remove the incentive). You would see jobs that have been eliminated return as businesses would be able to hire labor worth say $5/hr. There are a ton of potential jobs out there, all worth under the minimum wage. As of right now, for anyone with a skill set worth less than the minimum wage (say a 17 y/o kid just starting to work), it is essentially illegal for companies to hire them. This makes it significantly harder for young people to gain the experience to climb the ladder.

First world countries also have higher average IQ than 3rd world countries. IQ is a better indicator of birth rate trends. You can have a high IQ without a high level of academic achievement, but you usually can't have a high level of academic achievement with a low IQ.

Its not free money, you have to work to get money to invest first. Then you need to invest the time and energy to research the investment, determine its viability, find a means through which you can invest, etc etc. Now, some people can blindly invest and get lucky, but that only emboldens them to make uninformed investment decisions in the future. Eventually they will get burned with this line of thinking. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:27:02
Yes, you remove the incentive to do anything, to better yourself. You become completely dependent on the state for everything. This stifles innovation, suppresses job growth, basically makes it illegal for anyone with no work experience to try to develop a skill set (jobs at a pay level matching their skill set don't exist). 
I like the good intentioned nature of this project, but it would be a philosophical nightmare. Its fundamentally anti-freedom.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:56:58
Ya, it is a bit conspiratorial in certain areas of the article, just try to look past it to the core message. 
Its funny you touch on the deflationary nature of btc. Its something that I've been curious about as well. It encourages saving, not spending, which in turn slows economic growth. I'm not sure how that would play out in a mass adoption scenario (particularly if it reaches global dominance). What would that look like? I would think that eventually the price would stabilize enough to encourage more spending. I'm not a macro-economist, so I'm not sure how a society would function with a dominant deflationary currency. Goods/services would still have inherent value, so people will purchase them if that value is worth it to them. If bitcoin became the world standard currency (fully matured), would people be less motivated to spend than with USD? Wouldn't that mean other asset classes would need to provide greater returns than just holding currency (bitcoin) in order to encourage investment? It would be a complete overhaul of the entire economic and social structures in place today. This would be extremely disruptive, but would it be worth it in the end? Could you get enough people to buy into the entire philosophy? I honestly don't know.
At the same time, I don't see how the USD or any fiat currency for that matter can survive against such a competitor. Why hold a currency which loses value the longer you hold it when you have an alternative with greater utility and is appreciative in nature to boot?
