I personally put Drudge on the same level as Buzzfeed, although Buzzfeed has more fact checkers. I do like how the internet is filling up with copies. I'm just glad no one has made a good Bitcoin copy, the world has enough shitcoins.

To buy with cash, local bitcoin in a major city, in a public place. Exchange funds after transaction confirmed. I've never had a problem in NYC. I wouldn't trust any offers on that site over PayPal. Btc e doesn't need verification and neither does bitfinex. I want to say there's more, but I'm not sure. Good luck
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:52:35
Well it's more than likely a scam. Did anyone happen to throw them any bones?
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:31:42
That's good to know. Do you have any sources for these bugs?

I looked around the website, seems like the last time one of their wallets paid out was in August. I emailed the guy. We'll see what they say. I just checked my login and I'm at the payout. We'll see! Wouldn't want to have shared a false article, right?!
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:33:53
I reached the site payout when I reached the payout threshold and cashed out. Most bitcoin share referral links, although I haven't checked in a while. If they don't have a referral link, it's probably a sponsored post. We're an independent news provider. My transaction was part of this:

Nobody uses the bitcoin wallet program anymore? I remember that was the first way I had to use a wallet, before there were phone apps. It's a tough decision to make nowadays, considering the blockchain would take considerable time to download. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:32:37
I think that's what I wrote about in our site's article:   Storage is easy, but blockchain wallet isn't help for getting them off there, hahaha.
@_date: 2015-12-31 23:23:04
I like blockchain.info was not aware of any significant bugs that caused these massive losses. I see this article  that links to another redditors post who lost 99 btc.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:45:32
Does anyone have any suggestions for articles? We're documenting our bitcoin interactions across multiple platforms.

To buy anonymously you gotta pay. Over the Internet most sites charge about 15% but they don't directly say that. Like virwox, which requires exchanging USD to linden dollars then to Bitcoin. The fees are harder to calculate because of that. Websites that allow gift cards without id, are more direct with fees, but still high. On local Bitcoin or Craigslist you might be able to find someone who you can build trust with a d eventually go below 7% but that's hard to beat.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:13:56
You have a Bitcoin related website? We have one and are looking to team up with additional independent Bitcoin bloggers.

How I imagine "easy" being is this: Scan withdraw address, scan private key. That simple? I like how it sounds!
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:40:33
Damn right, no verification whatsoever. We don't like to verify. We're real people, but we don't want every exchange to know our specifics. Our website tries to stay true to that mentality. As long as you deposit Bitcoin, you can exchange it to USD, then loan it.
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:43:24
Correlation does not imply causation. There doesn't need to be a reason, the correct response is to play the market. Day traders would've seen this coming. Long term holders, keep holding. Most importantly mitigate risk through diversified interests.
@_date: 2016-03-29 09:05:08
Bitcoin can be used to invest in a variety of "securities" bitfinex has a margin lending program with solid returns. Btcpop has an investment pool. Btcjam loans. I'm very careful where i invest bitcoin and document my experiences with that.

He's making alot of broad assumptions and stereotypes about Bitcoin, the community, Libertarians, etc.

Bitcoinpaperwallet.org has instructions for the best way to print using ink and laser printers. I forget what the "paper" is called, but I've got Mylar for drawing and I'm going to try that.

As much as we love Bitfury, I (more than likely) won't watch that video. Their videos flaunting the new chips are awesome though!

Hardly livable income, but we figured it represented consistent returns without constant work.

Bitcoin has tremendous potential, but some do a great job of depicting only one side. Bitcoin will never be mainstream.

That is an incredible website. Wordpress rocks, it's incredibly flexible. Let's work out the details. I'll write a post for you, you write a post for me. I'd prefer to be given a topic, but I can't think what you could write for our blog, let me know what ideas. Or any other way to do this.

We have been margin funding for a couple months now. I wanted to share the article to hear what redditors strategies/ideas on this. I'm not sure if any other sites do this. Thanks!

What's the best segregated witness article? I don't understand it at all. I'm sure there's a simple way to define it, as well as the other side. I know there's two. Thanks redditors!

No verification necessary for moving bitcoin into the exchange, trading it, or for moving it out. Plus no fees on bitcoin deposits or withdraws (or minimums). Let us know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:34:37
I will be posting my results by tomorrow. That is, or gains thus far. Interest rates are correlated to the movement of bitcoin price. But I'm impressed, it is passive income, or interest. With little to no with, and no verification required. I've got from 48$ to $51 in a couple weeks. Good luck. Let us know how it works for you

We'll let the content we put out be the judge of the strength of our brand, "crook" name or not. How many countless other companies are out there big and small occupying major sector spaces have engaged in unscrupulous behavior at times with seemingly innocuous sounding names and mission statements? Passed on Do-Gooder Capital, went with something edgier instead. Bitcoin Bandits.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:45:02
 Come on, the article name is clickbait. I believe bitcoin isn't meant to go mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 04:50:31
I remember when my friend first bought bitcoin at the Bitcoin center. They were like confused that they had to pay over the spot price. I said look, if you're buying Bitcoin, you're making an investment. You don't hear people complaining about fees on stocks, but you do hear people complaining about income tax and capital gains taxes. Needless to say, the 5% premium on his 200$ Bitcoin was overcome in time. Now it's worth 6x much. Yes it's annoying, but it's like anything else, if someone wants to buy, there's someone willing to sell and make some dough.
@_date: 2016-03-29 09:08:01
There are plenty of honest mining pools. Don't be driven by the fear mongering of others. It can be a back and forth.
The only thing we can do about bitcoin scams is expose them, not invest in them, and contact them. People will do what they want 
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:46:39
I don't understand why people think the economy has to go up forever. It isn't practical. The more people admit that the economy goes up and down, the better they'll be able to plan for the downs. Humanity innovates, it's how we thrive. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:10:50
Have not used Poloniex yet don't know too much about them. We feel the margin funding rates are reasonable on Bitfinex, sometimes it adds up to close to one percent a month. In traditional investments thats dare I say astronomically high as well as risky. It's like just keeping your money on the exchange is a risk in of itself and we have a decent feeling on Bitfinex for the time being. 
Haven't gone through verification yet too much headache, not worth it for our purposes just yet. Just push it back to a wallet and cash out on P2P or an atm if we wanted to. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 02:06:30
Such click bait. Some people know they can get attention by saying bitcoin has failed, sold out, dead, etc. I see his point though actually, "putting on the suit and tie".

I think you answered your own question when you used the word "avoid" and "legal" in the same sentence. On the same note, Bob Dylan said "anything's legal in Jersey, as long as you don't get caught"

We wrote a review on indacoin. It allows anyone to buy bitcoin with a credit card and phone number. The initial limit is low, but each purchase it goes higher. There is a premium price but our readers get a discount.

To answer the question (ahem): The power of google! We don't really use reddit much, hahaha. But these guys know their stuff!

Concise, yet powerful. It embodies the internet culture in a way that moves it forward. Opens up more possibilities.

What do you mean? I have the link at the bottom, it's a button. I'll hyperlink every "coinomi"
@_date: 2016-02-02 05:08:10
Very cool! We run a site too, it's this reddit handle's name dot com. Running these sites are difficult though, it's essentially a hobby for us. But we figured it's a great way to learn about bitcoin and disseminate bitcoin interpretations across the internet. Which is another reason to get into bitcoin! aha!

Does anyone think we missed anything? We're mainly in the investment pools, but the exciting things are IPOs and stocks. Although many websites offer this, nothing on the scale of BTCPOP!
@_date: 2016-02-08 13:53:44
We'd like to hear what anyone thinks of coinomi. We tested other apps, but think this one is best. Thanks!

So I can't mine to a mycelium created address? Is there a way to do this? Does anyone have a link or easy way to describe HD security? Hate to be the odd one out, but everyone here is always so helpful!
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:05:29
Has anyone mined to a coinomi wallet? I tried mining to a bitcoin wallet with clevermining, but my stats didn't show up after 6 hours of mining. I'm not sure if it's the HD security getting in the way, or what. If anyone has info please share, thanks for the support everyone!
@_date: 2016-02-02 03:00:32
Is that your site? Very cool!
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:04:34
That's the beauty! It can be exported to several different wallet programs. Plus message signing for proof of ownership!
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:03:18
I think the benefit of the wallet is to transfer some bitcoin to it. Backup the phrase, then use shapeshift to trade! I hope in the future they're have a cross-altcoin transaction log that can keep track of buys and sells.
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:04:02
Thanks for the support, I haven't hurt a bad thing about it yet! I also use Mycelium, they're very similar and have integrated "exchanges" in different senses
@_date: 2016-02-22 04:33:22
I do wish they were both more transparent  on the fees, and they integrated a cross-wallet ledger for keeping track of trades. Mycelium rocks too, we use multiple wallets!
@_date: 2016-02-02 05:06:15
Care to elaborate? Bitcoin is only worth what people will pay for it. Without fiat, there would be no relation. Prices would vary wildly and be comparable to borrowing. I understand fiat money has to be stored in certain ways, and is never actually "owned" by the person holding it, as the government has the right to take it back, without notice. Their control over banks and vice versa make your argument quite valid though.

It's useful for those who thought it wasn't possible. It's not spam as long as you use quality RSS feeds. If you have a blog, you can use it to automatically tweet your articles. To make serious money, you need to have a large amount of traffic.

Is this a horrible idea? I don't understand?
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:14:36
We've had that problem so many times. The way they rate loans and people separately is a sham.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:16:36
The key is to go for new members and small loans. They're mini-ponzis. "reputation loans" are small and they usually pay them back since they're acquiring reputation to pull a bigger scam.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:15:41
Does anyone recommend any other sites for crowdfunding bitcoin investment "loans"? I know of bitlendingclub, but I was wondering if there was a hidden gem, or a more popular site with better results?
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:39:54
Great question! You should hold several positions: Daytrading 20%, 10% Short/Experminental, 70% long. Start small and build up.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:49:41
Awesome I'll have to check out that app. I use android myself, but the other person on my site uses ios. By paraphrase, you mean password, right?
Do you have any to recommend for android? Also, did you like our website? 
I'm sorry I'm shamelessly promoting my own website, but I want some input. There is nothing in the rules that says I can't share content I created. We have worked hard on it for months!

What are the benefits of bitaddress.org? I'm wondering because I looked at that one too but I like the design of the ones that printed with Canton Becker's wallet maker.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:16:15
What do you mean verification tools? I made one with Canton's and tried to spend but I lost a couple cents inside it I can't spend. Which wallet do you use on your phone?
