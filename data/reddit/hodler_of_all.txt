I like money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:28:24
Some of us make new accounts every few months or so. I've been on reddit for over 9 years.

THE BUBBLE POPPED!!!!
ABORT! ABORT! ABORT!
HOUSTON! WE'RE FUCKED!

r/silverbugs 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:20:48
Go a step further and try not to post anything.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:51:56
And a tax cut.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:05:31
My brother was mining way back 08' and was sure it would be worth something but nothing near what it's at now. 
I would have more but I thought it was a joke and was happy to get $100 a coin when I sold.
Turns out I'm the joke....
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:34:55
I have over a dozen. 
Ya gotta keep em' separated.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:50:33
555 video playlist????
Ain't nobody got time for dat!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:31:30
Well you're wrong there. But that's ok.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:53:51
I was already doxed once about 6 years ago and had some crazy fucker show up outside my condo. He knew me by my reddit name. 
So now, about every 6 months to a year I change it up. And now with crypto I could only imagine the crazy fuckers around now, it's also one of the reasons I rarely post pictures of anything I own. I don't even have much of a social media side, I have a FB for my phone games and a twitter cause its funny but never post anything. You never know who is watching. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:45:23
You had a good run friend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:26:46
Just make sure she signs a prenup.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:58:21
Second best time is now.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:02:45
4 years ago. 
In 2013.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:13:36
Because reddit is a shithole circle jerk.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:31:25
Guess their going to lose a lot of business.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:30:41
I lost over $100 million on my portfolio in the last 3 days...
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:06
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:44:51
It would be a smarter use of money to teach them something. A skill perhaps.
Giving poor people money is just a waste of money. They will still be poor. 
If they we're taught something, they could work their way out of poverty. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:37:04
YOU HEAR THAT BEZOS! FUCK YOU! WE'RE COMING FOR YOU.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:36
And buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:15:04
I agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:56:03
I feel a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money (or all of it) due to not paying taxes, or thinking they wouldn't have too.
The tax man **always** gets his money, it only a matter of time. 
I don't like it but it is what it is. I learned that 20 years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:29:32
ITT: so much envy.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:48:09
Havana banana haha haha!
Oh.....you're serious.

@_date: 2017-12-02 15:51:52
Like I said, I thought it was a joke. I knew it was 08' or 09' but wasn't sure. It was around Christmas when he told me about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:38:27
That's what I got my first bitcoin for.
(Ok, not really. I paid $13.24 for my first bitcoins)
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:45:12
I bought more rentals. Depending on the price, I'll be cashing out a sizeable amount after the first  of the year to pick up a few more places.
And big boy toys. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:27:15
I like popcorn.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:15:24
Ahhhhhhh. Another bubble.
When will the terror end.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:39:39
BUY THE DIP!
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:57:40
YOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:01:17
I'd be bitter to if I missed the rocket ship. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:23:34
People are bitter because we were right.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:32:14
5 years to the day that I was given my first coins.
Congrats. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:23:15
Been on reddit for going on 9 years and I change accounts every 6 months to a year, just depends. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:02:40
Oh really.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:32:05
We have our moments.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:47:53
As why I have a little bit (hehe) of everything.  Diversity is your friend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:46:26
I just cashed out as will. A whole 1% of my holdings. 
Congrats on the house purchase. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:56:17
Nope, never be afraid to take profits and if you have a loan I would cash out as much as I could to pay that loan off now.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:53:32
I can remember talking about million dollar BTC back in 2012.
Only a few more years...
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:52:28
I'm sure there are a lot of folks like that.
I got a buddy that while very well off is kicking himself in the ass.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:14:00
Yep. I was close to selling everything at $100. The only reason I kept anything was that my brother said I should just hold it and forget about it for a few years. I got rid of close to 75% of my BTC which was in the 5 digit range.
Can't think about that though, (well, try not to) just think of where it's going to go and jump on and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:35:19
I'm enjoying it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:34:25
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:44:15
Well everyone already knows how to buy Gold, so this is no surprise. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:40:03
I don't care.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:24:23
This is the exact reason I buy Gold every week and have been for the last 10 years.
I love my metals.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:24:01
Are the zeros in the right place?? Is it written backwards? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:52:35
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:03:18
Best time was yesterday,  second best time is now.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:54:08
That's just reddit in general. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:40:53
My go to place is a LCS (local coin store), I have a weekly order I pickup every Friday. 
For online purposes my goto places are:
These guys can be a bit overpriced but they have a lot of very nice pieces and every once in awhile you will find some nice stuff on sale. 
I really like these guys and they are my favorite place online. I buy from them 3 to 4 times a month.
Have fun if you take the plunge,  nothing feels better than a nice pile of [Gold]( in your hand.
Edit: also, I forgot to mention r/silverbugs. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:33:03
He'll be "found" soon. Hopefully he'll still have fingerprints. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:26:42
Less than that, a little over 10% of what I had. I have seen lots of profits though and have bought a few toys just to say I bought it because of crypto (even though I could have bought the stuff without cashing in). 
I believe I'm sitting on 12 different coins right now. So yes I'm still doing very well, and I know hindsight is 20/20, but I can't help but think, what if?
But then again, I could say that about apple stock as well, but I don't want to...
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:47:23
Ummm....you do know what that would mean....right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:51:12
Based on what I just said....can you not read?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:07:25
This guy stalks.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:58:55
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:29:52
All the stupid fucks saying " I told you it was a bubble" then watch it rebound to $15K next week.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:16
I have sold here and there just to get back my original investment but yes, the rest is on HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:24:07
I kept 6,250 and ended up selling a bit more last year to diversfy a little bit.
I still have a little over 10% of my original holdings.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:13:12
1 million per BTC. 
The perfect number. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:00:34
And I thought I sucked that I sold 18,750
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:54:04
It's only money...
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:42:52
My brother gave me 25,000 BTC 6 years ago. To bad I laughed at him and sold 75% of it when it hit $100... :/
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:47:05
Whoa. Simmer down sweetheart. Pull the panties outta your crack.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:45:11
I don't want to think about everything I used and sold in 2012, but it's one of the reason we are at this price now.
I still have a very good number, but I can't help but think, what if?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:05:47
I love my BTC, but I love my [Gold even more.]( 
 The only thing that feels better is pussy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:29:22
You bettcha. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:45:46
Guess it's time to start selling and buy back in after the crash.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:13:34
Come and get me motherfuckers!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:08:14
And that's why he poor, right?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:09:38
If you want to pay the highest price possible.  Sure.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:58:28
It's in the garage. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:04:58
This is the only way. I have over 50 addresses.
Just like investments, never have all your eggs in one basket. I learned that 30 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:06:30
Tommarrow?  Sweet.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:40:06
One Satoshi = 0.01 cent
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:27
I don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:52:47
Why not both? I like money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:07:59
Fucking Becky....
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:34:02
I like money so I have both. :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:42:12
High risk, high reward. 
I still had a decent amount from my BTC gift from my brother in 2012 and from an early purchase of ETH at the beginning of 2016. But I went ahead a put in a small amount (to me) of 2 million dollars into cryptos in June 6th 2016. I have sold enough in the last 6 months to recover my 2 million and then some. I am going to sell another 25% of my crypto holdings over the next few weeks. After that I will HODL the rest until a future point that I will get off the train and enjoy the rest of my life.
Never thought this year would turn out the way it has...WOW!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:54:49
I like both because I like money.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:26:34
I take delivery of my 812 SuperFast next week.  I am excited.
