Yes. The porn industry has been a main driver of online innovation for many years and a "killer app" is more likely to come from there than from remittances.

I use Bitpay and like them as a company - they are one of the flagship companies within the Bitcoin economy and have done a lot for merchant adoption and Bitcoin in general.

Yes and no. It depends on whether the 1BTC balance in your wallet is made up of many smaller amounts (inputs) or not.  
If the 1BTC was sent to your wallet as one whole Bitcoin, then what you describe above will happen.
However if your 1BTC  is made up of say lots of 0.1BTC inputs, your wallet would just send one of those and there would be no need for change. (ignoring fees for simplicity)

The receiving addresses you give out are not the public keys - they are a hash of the public keys. These, and the corresponding private keys are what give you ownership of your bitcoins and are linked within your wallet as a pair. Only you can generate the private key required to spend the bitcoins and this is done by your wallet software. When you send bitcoins, the network recognises that you have used the correct private key without you having to reveal it.

Retailers usually price items in local currency and collect the BTC equivalent of that amount. So lower BTC price means they receive more bitcoins for the same item.  
Payment processors like bitpay carry the fluctuation risk and fix the price at time of sale so if retailers opt to convert to local currency, they still receive the full price for their goods.

If you are meeting someone away from home to sell them bitcoins and are using localbitcoins "transaction service", you will need internet access to release the coins (either wi-fi or a mobile/cell data)

I remember those events yet I still stand by my point-  
The Bitcoin price stopped reacting to "news" about 2 years ago. The last massive price spike from £80 to £800 in Oct/Nov 2013 was mainly due to big chinese money entering the market and nothing to do with any "news".  
And similarly, other events which could have sent the price up or down have failed to do so.

Legitimate uses of Bitcoin include everything you would do with any other currency. However, Bitcoin offers several advantages over other currencies. With Bitcoin you can send payments to anyone in the world cheaply,  instantly, securely and (sort of) anonymously without the need for a bank or other third party. This was never possible before Bitcoin came along and the number of businesses accepting Bitcoin is growing by the day as more and more people see the benefits. Have a look at this ...

I hate these massive price rises of the last 6 weeks or so.

If you have 10 grand in Bitcoin, then the majority of it should be in offline cold storage. You can then have a wallet on your computer containg Bitcoin for buying stuff online or receiving payments. Then another wallet on your smartphone to which you transfer say 1 BTC for when you go to the bar. Each wallet will allow you to generate new receiving addresses which you should do for each new transaction. Although the balance of each individual address is public, the wallet that contains the private keys to access these addresses is not known. In other words, a wallet may contain 100 BTC spread over thousands of addresses so tracing an individual address to a real person is very difficult.

Assuming that they do have control of these bitcoins, I think they will keep them to use in future stings. Then again, they might buy some alpaca socks for the coming winter.

Pyramid schemes promise investors a high return on their money and pays them using money from new entrants. Bitcoin makes no such promises. It's value derives from its utility and its price is decided by market forces.  
And well done for being a software engineer by the way, I'm sure your advice and expertise will save a lot of people from losing lots of money.

Reindexing the whole blockchain can take up to 24 hrs. It starts off quickly and you'll find something like 95% is done in an hour or so but the last 5% takes ages. Your transactions will start to show up and appear as a balance once you reach the date of your fiirst transaction. Check your addresses on blockchaininfo. If the coins are there, you're fine. Don't worry.

Ignoring the obvious VI of the article, the average of 0.9% arises because the big companies who do a lot of volume are charged lower rates and this skews the figures. Your average independant retailer will be paying nearer to 2.5% and these are the people that Bitcoin is targetting.

It is technically possible that two different people could generate the same bitcoin address. In such a case, both would be able to spend the coins on that particular address. The odds of this happening are, however, so small that it is almost impossible

I sold some bitcoins to a guy the other day and he said that he was going to give one of them to his girlfriend as a birthday present.

When you click  "receive coins" and then "new address", in the "label" field you write in the name of the person (or whatever) who is sending you coins and then when you click "OK", the new address will be generated.  
Note that if your wallet is password protected (which it should be) it will ask for this passsword as part of the process.

Larger charities are too wary of the tax and/or regulatory systems. I don't know about anywhere else, but here in UK we have something called "gift aid" whereby the government will add the donor's income tax to their donation. So for a £10 donation, the charity will receive £12-£14 after reclaiming the tax. This does not apply to Bitcoin (at the moment) so would constitute a large loss of income should people start donating in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-21 13:22:39

Think of Bitcoin as the same as any currency: earn some or buy some.                  But earning them from faucets is a complete waste of time.       They're ok while you're getting into Bitcoin (we've all done it and it's nice to see your balance going up by a few satoshi every hour or so) but as a way of accumulating worthwhile amounts, forget it.

You are more likely to be robbed if you pull out a big wad of cash in the bar. But leaving that aside, you seem a litle confused about wallets and addresses and should read up about the difference to clear it up in your mind. It is important that you understand the difference so that you can conduct Bitcoin transactions more securely and protect your privacy.

"OH SHIT" .......... (as the feds came crashing through his door)
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:35:35
Of course it won't "tarnish your image". It will give your customers another way of paying. Advertise the fact that you take Bitcoin (a simple sticker in the window will do for now) and see what happens. You can start by doing things manually but if it takes off you can start looking at an automated system.
Good luck.
@_date: 2013-08-01 08:59:04
Aggregating the payments somehow is the best way to keep the fees down. Not only will the transactions be larger but the coins will be "older" which also reduces fees. Nice idea by the way.

What a bummer. Remember folks when doing a face to face trade with LBC always use the transaction service and not escrow. This is better for both parties security-wise and also allows either to cancel the trade. If you are an experienced seller and are contacted by a newbie buyer you should be explaining this to them and not letting them dictate the rules. Beware of scammers and if you're uncertain, back out.
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:28:01
You don't have to meet in person. I'm sure the moneygram method is fine or you can do a bank transfer or cash deposit at a local bank. But make sure the person has a good reputation and use the escrow/transaction service.

If you sign up to localbitcoins (it's quick and free) they will automatically provide you with an online wallet where your coins will be deposited when you pay for them (make sure you enable 2-factor authentication)  Ideally, you should transfer them straight out and into a local wallet on your computer or smartphone to increase security. All online exchanges (and SR) provide wallets which function normally when it comes to receiving and sending bitcoins but they are not the safest place to store bitcoins long term.

In answer to your other question about bitpay... if you buy something from a merchant using bitpay (online or in a physical shop), you will be given a unique one-off address to send payment to. Bitpay then collects this payment and then pays the merchant (either in Bitcoin or local currency depending on what the merchant specifies) Neither bitpay nor the merchant has any way of knowing how many Bitcoin you have in your wallet(s)

Good luck. I followed your exploits last time. I think you'll find things a little easier this time.

You can have as many addresses wihin your wallet as you want. In fact, it is good practice to use a new receiving address for every transaction. When you click "receive" you should then see a button  "new address"  Click this and a new address will be created which you can then "label"  so you can kep records of who sent what.  
If you have your wallet encrypted with a password (which you should) it will ask for your password as part of the process of creating a new address.

It's comforting to know that nobody has fallen for this (yet) ...

For a newbie, faucets are a fun way to earn a few satoshi while you're learning how things work and it's fun watching your balance creep up. But as a way of accumulating any significant amount they are a waste of time and effort.  
 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:20:33
You need to distinguish between bitcoins as currency/payment system and Bitcoin as a new protocol.  
It is the protocol which is the new technology and is what gives the coins value.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:42:05
Yeah, and I have sat in loads of concept cars at motor shows.
@_date: 2013-08-05 09:24:35
Bitcoin is the first, the biggest and the best. Unless another "coin" has significant benefits over Bitcoin and/or can do something which Bitcoin can't, Bitcoin will remain the biggest and best. This is why Bitcoin has got the best future potential.

A paper wallet is not a good place for a newbie to start. They can be difficult to set up and it's very easy to lose money when you come to spend them because of the "change" issue.
I suggest you download a simple lightweight client like electrum or multibit onto your computer and if you have an android phone, the "Andreas Shildbach" mobile wallet or blockchain's mobile wallet. When you have done that you will easily be able to start sending and receiving bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-28 12:34:52
....... Anyone?
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:51:28
Speaking from experience, I have to say that localbitcoins provides a very good service and well done to them for reaching out to Spanish-speaking users.
@_date: 2013-05-25 11:08:41
Where is your local area?
And do you know many Bitcoiners?
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:15:52
When you make an offer to buy using the "transaction service", localbitcoins will verify that the seller has deposited the Bitcoin and will give you a secret code number that only you know.
When you meet the seller in person, you give them the cash and they release the Bitcoin to your wallet. 
The seller then receives the same secret code that only you knew and should be able to show it to you.
The only way they can know and show you this secret code is if the Bitcoin is now in your wallet.
The buyer doesn't even need a mobile device to use this service.
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:02:00
Congratulations. Your discovery of Bitcoin has coincided with one of the biggest ever stories in Bitcoin history. Where are you based?

Then don't advertise and/or sell until your product is ready.  
It's taking so long, I wouldn't be surprised if it was obsolete by the time it comes out.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:38:15
Has it downloaded the whole blockchain and ready to go?
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:42:27
The good thing about using a payment processor is that it requires zero up-front costs to start using them and even if you don't make a single Bitcoin sale, you've lost nothing.  
A custom made package requires an up-front cost with no guarantee of return.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:43:37
Right, go to "receive coins" then "new address" and post the address on here. I will send you some coin and then I'll give you an address to send it back to (we might lose a bit in fees, but whatever)
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:57:32
@_date: 2013-08-21 11:59:30
Do you mean "how do I buy Bitcoins"?
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:45:38
In your FAQ under "payment" it says 
How can I pay?
Currently we support only PayPal. If you think we should accept other payments (like Bitcoin), let us know!
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:30:43
This is becoming a joke now.  
They might as well offer 5 for the price of one. There is no sign of any of them turning up.
@_date: 2013-09-28 11:23:34
Some localbitcoins sellers will allow you to deposit cash into their account without meeting or instead of cash you can do it online with a bank transfer. Again, choose a seller with good feedback and ask them as many questions as you want. A good seller will answer any questions and guide you through the process. But make sure you use the transaction service or escrow.

The trouble with these password strength testers is if you test your actual password, it might come out as super strong but it becomes somewhat compromised having been used on the tester. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:28:54
The Bitcoin protocol was written so as to mimic real world gold production - the deeper into the mine you go the harder and more expensive it is to extract the gold.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:44:12
Everyone thinks the same.  
They either wish they bought some or bought more.
What's done is done. Get on with life and stop beating yourself up over it.

That site is full of malware.  
"bitlisten" is the site you should use.

The actual article says  "So now that we have been informed that **(allegedly)** the US government is in possession of former Silk Road-controlled Bitcoin"     .... perhaps the title should be changed

If it's just for online donations then just paste a Bitcoin address QR code on the website with a little bit of text and  the Bitcoin symbol.
It would be a good idea to change the address once a week or whatever, depending on the volume of donations.

Why don't you try localbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:40:51
Do you accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:54:53
.... Unless they were unable to act.
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:45:58
This document says they have the "authority" to seize the bitcoins and transfer them to their own wallet. It does not say that they have done.
@_date: 2013-09-27 09:16:30
Why would anyone pay someone else to do something they could do for themselves for free, more securely and with much less hassle? Pointless.

You should look out for the next London Bitcoin meet-up and come along.
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:03:56
Have you tried  ?
@_date: 2013-10-03 11:14:06
Silk Road needed Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't need Silk Road. An alternative will soon pop up so everything's cool and Bitcoin and life goes on.

@_date: 2013-09-28 09:49:47
The method of payment is fine. But I would pick a seller with a bit more history and +feedback just to be a bit safer.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:49:10
keep trying to contact the seller and if you get no luck, contact localbitcoins support
@_date: 2013-09-10 09:43:03
When buying bitcoins with a CC, it's the seller who is most at risk of being scammed, not the buyer.

Assuming you have read up on everything you need to know, the next thing you need to do is get youself a wallet. See here...

Fair play guys. That is awsome. Well done.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:39:15
Of course it's safe.  
If you don't let people know your address, how are they going to send you bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:30:17
Nice one jason.  
Do you provide ongoing support for these guys?
@_date: 2013-08-01 10:26:20
Sorry. I misread it. As you say, for transmitting funds across the world, Bitcoin is perfect - providing it can be exchanged at the other end.
@_date: 2013-09-21 13:37:05
Well, have a look for yourself and see what you think. Here's my website... 
click on one of the order now buttons and see how easy and quick it is to use/pay. I would imagine it would be even easier for your customers because they wouldn't have to provide a shipping address. Two clicks, payment. Job done.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:58:29
Received. Happy to have helped demonstrate how easy Bitcoin transactions can be. When you have enough Bitcoin, you might consider buying a T-shirt... 
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:40:12
I mean obsolete in the sense that someone could be secretly working on something as good or better and manage to bring it to market before trezor.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:12:14
No offence, but ...  
@_date: 2013-09-17 13:00:33
Leaving aside that this story is at least 3 onths old, it is also factually incorrect. I have visited the Pembury Tavern and whilst it is a great pub and accepts Bitcoin, it was not the first pub in Britain to do so.
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:25:43
Whereabouts in the UK is he? I sell but I only do in-person cash trades. But wherever he is, he should be able to find a seller on localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:22:35
I do this with every person I talk to Bitcoin about. I have about a 50% success rate and always follow up by sending them a few millibits to get them started.  
The last time I did it was 2 weeks ago. Sat in my local bar (which accepts Bitcoin), using mobile phones I sent someone enough for a beer. They didn't spend it and I have just bumped into that person and told her that she now has enough for 1.5 beers. Needless to say, she was impressed.
@_date: 2013-07-31 14:01:52
You're welcome.
And I've posted the story on my facebook page   
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:02:43
I think this is what the OP is on about...
Looks like an expensive way to buy bitcoins.
Once in your blockchain wallet though, they can be sent anywhere
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:46:22
I thought the robocoin ATM allowed you to sell bitcoins as well as buy.
@_date: 2013-09-28 15:11:53
Without a fee it could take days, but it will confirm eventually
@_date: 2013-09-06 08:40:21
How about a nice T-shirt?...  
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:49:00
... and the connection to Bitcoin is...?
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:44:46
Use localbitcoins.  
You could sign up and have bitcoins in your wallet within 15 minutes.
