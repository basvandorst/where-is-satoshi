CEO of Swissborg explains in a very simple and understandable way, why DAOs are the future. That certainly includes Bitcoin in my view, the creator and father of all DAOs

Bitcoin is not a fiat replace but a storage of value equivalent to gold or even better. But expect governments to make their own digital currencies to include thinks like interest more over . Bitcoin has a limitation . Every product that is produced by humankind need an equivalent. If the 7 digits after zero of the bitcoins are exhausted, how do you wanna give Proudced items an equivalent?
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:51:45
That’s correct. A final financial crash is unavoidable as its part of every financial system. I hate the US for having this bloodshed form of capitalism and they spread this virus over the world. As Germans, we currently still do good but you are feeling economic boom is over once and for all. Most cities had an real estate increase over 1000% or more in the last 5 years.  We need to switch over to the Scandinavian democratic model. Cut the super rich but keep them st the top. We don’t say to the super rich, spend your money to the poor but folks help yourselves !!!  A welfare state will always increase the wealth of everyone, even though you are the last one on the ladder. This is the only solution we have got. Some European countries adopted it already but that’s not enough. Us people need to repeat its independent war. The lobbyism eats its own children!!! Viva la bitcoin

Ok but please reply my second part. Do you know why more fiat is printed in general? To have for everything worth someone, an equivalent. Most bitcoin maniacs are relating that fiat is printed to pay out interest, this is just a part of the truth but not the truth itself. How bitcoin gonna solve this problem ? (Scalability)

Real estate is real. A stone and the ground under it will always have value. The goal is to find an optimal entry point.  So never invest everything in one thing but diversity. Real estate, crypto and stocks with yield
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:00:57
I think you don’t get my point tho.. if you don’t print for every valuable object an equivalent, how do you wanna pay new stuff, if don’t have any sats left and how do you want to identify it’s bitcoin value even. It’s theoretically not possible. You can’t break the sats into 2 pieces and therefore you can’t scale bitcoin once it’s exhausted.

I advise you to read the book das Kapital from Karl marx before trying to explain the term socialism. :) 
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:28:16
No, im not a marixist, but he made good examples on how socialism should work. There isnt a singular theory on socialism but one of the most popular came from Marx &amp; Engels. Stop switching topics. Admit that you have literally 0 knowledge about what socialism is really about. Im out. argumentation as trump kills rational people like me. Fuck off dude
@_date: 2018-11-12 02:38:05
We in Germany have a social democracy and this is the best what ever happened to this country. Still improvement there..
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:07:44
I disagree. I studied history and what happened in 33 and upwards didn’t have a single crossover with real socialism. Just look up for the Vierjahresplan. Everything was set to build an army within 4 years to overtake the east included Russia, there was no space for socialism. People who paid monthly for a new car, invested in tanks instead. Der sonntagseintopf was just a try to adjust the German to rationed food especially meat. And those are just 3 examples out of dozens. Unlike many other countries Germany has the so called erinnerungskultur. The country is doing everything to not repeat history and it won’t hopefully 
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:11:43
Fake news. Yeah there were some incidents. But as you know rapes and so on happens on a regular basis and the criminals aren’t mostly refugees. There were some of them, and they need to be punished but don’t trust every shit on the internet. I worked the past 2 years as security in my hometown dusseldorf and never had any accident. My brother who is a German police officer never experienced any gun or rape violation in Düsseldorf and around which was initiated by refugees. Most of them just came for work, to earn not to fuck their brain outs. Because fucking won’t fill your stomach

These Nigerian scammers understood that the scam “your multi millionaire uncle died and had no kids, transfer 500 $ for the fees and we will transfer the whole money on your bank account” doesn’t work anymore ��
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:10:29
Multi utility tokens incl. networks like eth + bitcoin.   The rest will die, every single coin or token that hasn’t any real use case and marketing will die. Stop this ponzi shit ! 
BTW: lee once insulted me for saying that ltc can’t be the silver currency  behind gold bitcoin. There is no reason for a digital silver, when you nearly the same technology. Gold and Silver can’t be compared ! I’m still sharing this opinion, noob lee

As exchanges mostly fear laundering , you need first to verify your identity... no one privately will trade such amounts without exchange or trusted institutions as middle men

As a little kid you might get scammed really fast. I really prefer that you get your mom or dad to find a solution otherwise you lose everything.
