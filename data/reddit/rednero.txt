I agree. The thing is, people wont pay hundreds of dollars per transaction, they will just use an altcoin. Bitcoin is opt in. Making it expensive just pushes people out of the network, which is suicidal because the only thing giving bitcoin its value is its user base.

Realistically they don't. The majority has the power. Either a compromise will get reached or 80%+ of people will move over to XT and go from there

The fees will never get too high because bitcoin is opt in. People won't pay $30 per transaction, they'll just use an alt

People seem to not understand that bitcoin is opt in. People aren't going to compete with each other to pay higher fees to get into small blocks, they will just use an altcoin.

There wouldn't be hard fork after hard fork because it would only have to happen a few times before people learn trying to impose your own ideal on the ecosystem as a dev fails, because the ecosystem forks around you. Its learning the hard way vs the easy way, but it is still learning.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:12:59
How is it core shut down? Bitcoin doesn't need one master implementation. If development splits between the two then the ecosystem is more decentralized

They're not socks, they're people that understand the situation and they are the clear majority.

You realize this works both ways? The 1MB block limit was always supposed to be temporary. People signed up for global p2p electronic cash, not LN. Why should one groups opinion be forced upon another? Especially as it is the minority trying to restrict growth for the majority.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:19:26


Forking just proves anti-fragility. If it can be controlled by 5 people against the wishes of the majority *then* bitcoin loses all credibility. If progress in a decentralized system can be vetoed by a vested interest group, it has no credibility.


The least trusted devs are the blockstream devs by a wide margin. I don't know if it is justified, but it is a fact.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:25:00
If the blockstream guys were a bit smarter they would have compromised to 2 or 4mb, it would have been in place by now and people would be looking forward to lightning network. Digging their heels in against the majority and then desperately parroting 'alt-coin' backfired horribly. They get code but they don't get people.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:54:17
From the outside it seems as though Gavin was the only one making any compromises. He proposed 20MB but through talks agreed to bring it down. His opposition wouldn't give an inch. This is what caused the whole issue. We could easily have a 2/4MB block limit right now, there would be no drama and people would be looking forward to LN developments. It took the threat of Gavin and XT to light a fire under the 1MB-ers asses. The latest BIP proposal I saw was ridiculous, with tiny potential for growth, clearly an appeasement tactic. Its probably too little too late but it should be a lesson in why devs sticking their fingers in their ears and ignoring the majority isn't going to work in a decentralized ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:06:01


Its not unappreciative, it is facts. The only devs we know that are paid by a company that can directly profit from forcing specific types of payment channels on the ecosystem are the blockstream devs. Thats called a conflict of interest. And it means anything they do is, and should be, doubly scrutinized. It also means that naturally, they are the least trusted.

"Using bitcoin" isn't just making transactions. Everyone that holds bitcoin is using it as a store of value.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:47:33
But it highlights what makes bitcoin/cryptos strong. Individual opinions don't matter. 
That's why I am not worried about the upcoming fork, it demonstrates bitcoins strength - even the people that write the code don't hold the power, it remains with the majority.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:49:33
You don't understand human nature at all. That would backfire horribly.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:24:17
There's little chance of anything going wrong because the fork only occurs when 75% of miners agree. The last 25% dont want to lose money so they will move over to xt pretty fast

If your coins are at coinbase it wont effect you, coinbase will update you. If your coins are static you don't need to do anything.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:00:37
No one knows their motivation and that is part of the problem. None of us know if they are in it for blockstream profits or not, so everything is questionable, no matter how innocent they may be they will be scrutinized and theorized against because of a clear conflict of interest.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:19:06
Then they have learnt nothing from this and the xt fork is inevitable. This whole thing came about from an unwillingness to compromise.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:21:03


It is a compromise when the majority is behind the raise.


You would take the matter to arbitration, who's job is to enforce rules *made by the majority*, judging that we have property laws and it remains all his property. 
The smallblockers are ignoring the majority. That's how this all started.

Yes perhaps, there is no way of knowing their true intentions. Whether it effects their current actions we do not know, but the conflict of interest is still there.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:14:36
If the xt fork happens, at 75% of the hash rate, 'current bitcoin' will become the alt because it will only have 25% of the miners. Xt will be bitcoin by definition as the longest chain. At the fork Core will have already lost because miners aren't going to stick around on the dying chain for long.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:52:34


Right, which is what happens in reality.


The want of the majority is what decides what the rules of the system are. That's how it can function as a decentralized network. If 5 people control it against the want of the rest, it is centralized in nature.
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:01:59


Yes. By a factor of eight.


All they have to do is follow the concensus rules of the network. They can make core accept bigger blocks and carry on working on that. This would actually be good for bitcoin.
Growing the block size and finding ways of increasing transactions on the network are not mutually exclusive.

No one will be effected yet. Nothing has happened and it wont until 75% of miners are running the xt code. If your coins don't move they aren't affected whatever happens. The only people that need to be careful are people that are actively transferring coins during the fork (which isn't yet)
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:33:16
1MB blocks are only invalid when the majority says they are. When the majority (+75%) are running XT they are no longer the minority, so they can't by definition, be invalid.
You seem to think validity and consensus are these arbitrary settings opposed to their actual definition. The only rules are the rules of the majority.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:36:55
The only reason people are moving to xt is that it is the only currently viable big blocks implementation. People will choose the best of bad options. If there was more compromise we would be running Core with 2/4MB blocks right now and no talk of xt. But the 1MBers don't want to, so it has to be xt.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:11:11
There's been deliberation time, over 2 years of it. There is no point in deliberating with people that do not concede any ground, it's a waste of time. Gavin did what was right and forked the code allowing the community to decide the path bitcoin takes instead of a small group of devs.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:45:12
Learn that his actions have the exact opposite effect of what he is hoping for. Xt will piggyback on the censorship/centralization debate and be all the community is talking about now, it's not like this is the only place on the internet. Also painting yourself in a bad light with authoritarian censorship and petulance, and then strongly associating with one side in the debate pushes people the other way. He probably single-handedly doubled xt nodes.
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:06:21
Wow. You still didn't learn.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:24:25
We do know this for sure because that is what economic incentives ensure. Its why the miners are mining bitcoin and not pandacoin

The problem is you seem to think that right and wrong is objective, which it isn't.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:21:43


Which is irrelevant because the devs don't decide, the community does. That's why bitcoin is antifragile, it can fork around a handful of people stifling progress. See how the positive reception of xt has caused panic stations among the blockstream devs? Thats how you know it works. You work *with* the majority or you lose out.

@_date: 2015-08-17 16:11:26
I think many people understand, they just aren't as risk averse. But it also makes no difference who is right. In a decentralized system you have to compromise with the majority or you get cut out, that's how it works. Something I think the blockstream devs are just learning.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:41:02
Outsiders can't know what any of the devs motivations are, so being affiliated with a company that have the potential to directly profit from the actions of the core devs creates a conflict of interest, regardless of whether it is acted on. I'm not saying you or any of the blockstream devs are doing anything they would not be otherwise, I'm explaining why there is extra scrutiny, because of the potential for shenanigans.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:56:34
No. It might feel like it is going against what you want personally, but for the majority it is what they want. That is what bitcoin is, the want of the majority.
@_date: 2015-08-18 06:03:49


Its ultimately self sabotaging because a) it is riskier than just accepting bigger blocks and b) people will see a rise in xt nodes as support for xt because the majority aren't going to be technically knowledgeable to know what spoofing is.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:17:54
This is called an appeal to authority.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:23:05
People know what they are getting into. If dumb stuff starts happening with xt development then what happens is exactly what is happening now with core, it gets forked.
@_date: 2015-08-17 00:59:36
Because these problems aren't technical, they are ideological. It is obvious when supposed 'leading engineers' are calling xt an alt-coin that they have an agenda and are willing to play fast and loose with facts. They undermined their own position. This incident has shone light on how their egos have compromised their decision making. To act as though Core is the divine implementation and anything else is an alt. They may be great at coding, they could be the best, but it makes no difference if they have these kind of ideological delusions of grandeur.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:58:11
So would a lot of people, but that isn't an option because a few devs believe only their opinion matters. Luckily the bitcoin ecosystem can combat this by forking around them.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:56:57
Then the blockstream devs have nothing to worry about because 75% wont be met and their won't be a fork. But their actions betray them. Even they believe they may be in the minority, else they wouldn't be denouncing XT, they could just ignore it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:48:43


This change has been bought about by 1mb-er devs. If they had compromised XT wouldn't have gotten any traction. The ideal would be a BIP, but it has been made clear that they were not willing. The move to XT has been forced by small blockers, no one else. The fork isn't really about the 8x increase, its about a small group believing that they could veto aganst the want of the majority and finding out that actually, no that doesn't work in a decentralized system.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:14:58


We do. The 1MB-er devs thought they didn't need to listen to anyone else. This is a good reason to fork. If their egos get in the way over something as basic as raising the temp block limit, what about bigger decisions later on? And that's without taking into account blockstream.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:35:45
That's understandable, and now that you know the position of the majority of subscribers, that xt is not an alt nor is it off topic, you can adjust moderation to reflect this.

The fork isn't the fault of mike and gavin. They are just doing what the majority want. The fork is the fault of the blockstream devs that refused to make any compromise whatsoever, against the majority, until their feet were held to the coals by XT gaining traction.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:21:53
The longest valid chain is what bitcoin is, which once 75% is reached it will be, so no, XT is not an alt. Unfortunately you attached your ego to a single implementation. Bitcoin Core isn't bitcoin. And consensus dictates what bitcoin is, there's no list of commandments.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:33:08
Its comical how badly it has been dealt with. A real comedy of errors. And it has no doubt increased support for xt by making smallblockers look like authoritarian nutjobs
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:13:49


Right, which is whats happening, which is why its funny that they are complaining. It won't be an alt because it will be the same blockchain and token. The core devs don't have to implement any block raise. The result of which will be them being devs for an implementation that doesn't follow consensus rules.
Its how it works in reality vs how some people think it should work.
