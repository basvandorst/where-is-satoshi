bitFlyer. So you guys know has Free trading without commissions until Jan 31. I was approved in less than 30 min for $50,000 daily deposit limit. My transfers to Trezor fast and cheap.  No app but if you use Safari from
IPhone it’s as simple as coinbase’s app. Also after purchasing you don’t have to wait 7 days for your coins. Their trading platform is as good as Gdax as well. Bitflyer is biggest exchange in Japan. I left coinbase last month. Forget segwit (which is a big deal$ Ridiculous times for transactions. Market orders $1500-2000 above price! I had enough. I pay less than $5.00 to transfer to trezor and goes through faster than coinbase.

Hours? Really ? Of course with coinbase. ��. You must be used to them. I like your description of BTC as “hot Crypto” ��
I have transferred from HitBTC, Kraken, bitFlyer, and used many wallets like GreenAddress,
Breadwallet, Exodus and HW like Trezor,Ledger and it does not take hours even with the current mempool. What all this means : exit your coinbase bubble.

Great recommendations. Will check them all out. Bye bye coinmarketcap.

Because of this I switched to Bitflyer and can’t be happier. Wire transfer was easy. If you require $50,000 daily deposit/withdrawal and approval for this in 30 minutes. Free commissions until Jan 31.  Withdrawal was $2.50 to Segwit address. 
I did apply to Gemini but my account is still under review. 
I made 2 recent purchases in coinbase app and I got filled $2000 and $1500 above market price! plus their “cheap” commission fees of 1.5%. Add the politics and you would be out of your mind to stick with coinbase. I am out of coinbase.

I am including YouTube videos that you can stream like a podcast.  I do like WCN and Tone Vays for the news. TA for long term holding BTC is when I stop watching. 
I like Bitcoin &amp; the markets with Lindner. And the bitcoin knowledge Podcast with Trace Mayer.  Magical crypto friends is also entertaining but content very sporadic. 
I see your points of why you dislike some characters. JW weatherman is very hardcore politically but I think he is a smart guy with interesting points. 
Not everyone is great at WCN but at least they put out material frequently to stay in Tune with what’s happening. 
Even though we disagree you have written a very good analysis. Interesting to have diverse opinions. That’s how the world is. Refreshing to see we have different ideas when it comes to the space.

Congratulations on running a full node. I want to thank you for helping the network stay stronger. I run a node as well to help bitcoin with no financial gain. I have not setup a LN; you can also download armory and verify your own transactions. That’s the recommendation from Trace Mayer.

I have used Gdax, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Bitflyer, Square Cash. 
Easiest by far is square cash and you can withdraw ₿ immediately. Link your debit card and you are buying btc in 5 min.  My favorite for small amounts. 
For larger amounts I like Bitflyer (largest Japanese exchange now in USA) with wire transfer and limit orders. Transaction fees are zero. 
For ACH deposit I like Gemini. Gemini has Insurance on fiat and BTC.  Gemini is class but expensive. 
I don’t use anymore Coinbase/Gdax  since I got screwed 3 times with major slippage plus they don’t really support ₿ with their actions from last year. 
Good luck

Only one currency USD and Bitcoin you can transfer out to bank linked to debit card USD and ₿ to bitcoin wallet. You can’t transfer ₿ to square cash though. You can apply for square cash debit card but you don’t pay with ₿. If you want to pay with ₿ you can simply use the app to send ₿. More info here :
