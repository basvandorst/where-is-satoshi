Again that Neal Palmquist guy is commenting on a Bitcoin article in a very negative way. What a fucking douchebag.

As if that two year Bitcoin chart can just be compared one on one with a life-cycle chart...

The last plateau was between 60 and 120 USD and lasted for 6 months. The one before that was between 5 and 20 USD and lasted more than a year.
Now we have a plateau of around 450 to 650 USD and this has lasted for 5 months.
You need to be more patient.

Exactly. In Holland we have Bitonic.nl:
Anyone with a bankaccount and internetbanking (99% of the population) can buy bitcoins within 2 minutes.

Just say that Bitcoin is protocol which can be used for different things. One application is currency but this application is not really all that interesting right now for companies, mainly due to the price fluctuations.
The most important application right now is that of Bitcoin the payment system. And then just name the upsides of Bitcoin compared to existing old world payment systems, like no risk of chargebacks, very low fees and very easy to integrate on your website.
And of course explain that to make use of Bitcoin the payment system you can use a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase, who will take away all the risks associated with Bitcoin. 
And to close I would name the venture capital that has found its way into the Bitcoin world and into companies like Coinbase and Bitpay and then also name some big names like Expedia and Overstock and maybe share some articles with your CEO that show that these companies are quite positive about their implementation of Bitcoin the payment system.

Lol, again that loser Neal Palmquist is being a huge douchebag. Why would you be cheering that people are losing value in Bitcoin due to the recent price drop?
You don't have to like Bitcoin but this guy takes it to a new level. He needs to get laid and chill the fuck out.

What's bullshit? Is this bullshit?
"European merchants have processed more than 28 million euros this year in bitcoin payments compared to 1.4 million euros for the same months in 2013, which is a staggering 1900% year-over-year growth. "
But dude, 28 million euro's is nothing compared to the entire European economy. You have to be patient.  This article just shows things are heading in the right direction.

Exactly.

You should also mention Expedia when you name big companies who started accepting Bitcoin.

A double charge happens all the time in creditcardland. Somehow a signal ends up at the creditcard company twice and you are charged twice. 
My company has been told this is an issue with the creditcard payment systems themselves.
So doesn't have to be the user's fault or Circle's fault.

I never said it was your fault. Where are you reading that?
I said this could be an issue with the creditcard systems. Sometimes two approvals for payment are given for the same purchase. That doesn't make any sense, but it happens. 
If that happens, the company (Circle in this case) will only use one of those approvals (since you only gave one order) and then the other approval will be released again automatically by the creditcard company in 5 to 10 days.
The confusing thing is this shows up on your card as two charges, when it's not two charges. It's two approvals of which only one will be used.
If you want to speed up the release process of the 2nd approval code, Circle will have to fax your bank.

Be sure to include money-laundering and Mexican drug cartels.

I believe pedophiles use the internet as well. So maybe we should just shut down the internet.
