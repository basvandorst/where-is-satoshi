I've spoken with our tax guy and I'm fully prepared for the tax implications, so that's not an issue.  I am concerned about getting my checking and/or savings accounts flagged, or, worse, getting funds frozen.  I've considered trying to speak with somebody at my bank, perhaps with an attorney and/or my accountant, to make them aware of transfers, but I'm concerned about even doing that for fear that merely mentioning bitcoin will result in a negative response.
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:58:06
For sure!  It sounds like you're further along than me, but I do plan to meet with a few local credit unions to have a chat.  Unfortunately, I currently bank with one of the big guys, and I'm all but certain what the response will be.

Hey guys, I'm bullish on gold if somebody will sell me some for ~$600/oz.
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:05:16
The answer is obvious.  Because like gold, bitcoin is heavy and difficult to send across long distances.

The exchange rate isn't determinative of success, but it is somewhat indicative of it.  An exchange rate of single digits at this point, or any point in the future, would be a bad thing.
On the other hand, if bitcoin comes to sustain larger volumes of economic activity, the exchange rate will reflect that as higher values.

I'm not sure what you're yeah-no-ing to.  The idea of some institution tracking coin use for specific coins?  The idea that a wrapper would be required to do this?  The idea that it could be done at all?
Starting from the bottom up.  It can easily be done.  And, it can probably be done without a wrapper since coins can easily be tracked, and if the parties are known, as they would in this use case, users can be tracked and contracts could stipulate approved uses within a context where parties agree to abide by a contract.
To my mind, this is the sort of thing where bitcoin offers real innovative solutions.  There are a lot of use cases for a global, decentralized, trustable, ledger that's easy to mine data from.

Bitcoin addresses like this, 1BTCorgHwCg6u2YSAWKgS17qUad6kHmtQW, can have values of bitcoins assigned to them.  Knowing an address does not give you the ability to spend the bitcoins associated with it.  Bitcoin addresses with values of bicoins associated with them, or ones that have had values associated with them, are publicly visible in the blockchain; but again, knowing them doesn't tell you anything about the private key that you **need to know** in order to spend an address' bitcoins.
The blockchain does not store private keys.  Whether somebody has encrypted their wallet (which essentially means hiding the private key behind a password) is not information you can gather from the public blockchain.  The only way to know whether a person's wallet is encrypted is for them to tell you that, or to have access to their wallet, which typically means having access to their computer, either physically or by hacking into their computer remotely.
If you have access to a person's wallet, say you hacked into their computer and took the file, and it's encrypted with a strong password, then you won't be able to spend their bitcoins.
You asked why you need an online wallet.  You don't.  They're convenient because you don't have to download the growing blockchain and you can easily use them from other computers.  But, they can be less secure than a wallet hosted on your own computer.  Or, they could be more secure if you don't encrypt your wallet and your computer is at risk of getting compromised by an attacker, say, if you have bad security habits (e.g. clicking on unknown links in emails, running old versions of Java and Flash, etc).
You asked what is the central repository for addresses and their associated bitcoin values.  It is the blockchain, which anyone can gain access to.
If you want to send coins from a computer other than your own, you would either need to import your backed up wallet (perhaps you emailed an encrypted copy to yourself, or you have a copy stored on a key ring USB) into a bitcoin client installed on the computer your want to send the coins from.  Or, you would import your wallet into an online wallet service, in which case you can spend them from any internet connected computer.
In bitcoin jargon "address" and "wallet" do not mean the same thing.  A wallet is more than merely a collection of addresses.  It is a repository for the private keys needed to spend bitcoins associated with addresses related to those private keys.
Bitcoin can be technically confusing, and I do see this as a barrier to entry.  I think understanding some relatively non-technical basics is helpful in understanding how to keep your bitcoins safe, and I think if bitcoin grows in popularity it will require and reflect people becoming better educated, to some degree, about how it works.  I can't see it becoming too widely adopted without people becoming somewhat educated about how it works, because not doing so poses a security risk that will likely turn people off because their poor understanding prevented them from safeguarding their bitcoin wealth.
PS.  The address in the first paragraph is to the bitcoin foundation.

I corresponded briefly with somebody at Coinbase a few weeks ago, but unsurprisingly they are unable to facilitate the sorts of transfers I'm interested in.  Let me know if you get any response from CampBX.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:20:44
As I mentioned above, I have yet to speak to anyone at my bank.  My hesitation is that merely mentioning bitcoin will cause problems I don't want to have.  Before I meet with my current bank, I'm a bit more inclined to hunt around and have meetings with local credit unions to see if any of them would be friendly to the sorts of transfers I'd like to do over the next few months.  In fact, if I could find one that would work with me, I'd be willing to do all my banking with them.
@_date: 2013-08-18 14:34:28
This.  There's very little trust in Gox's ability to release USD funds.  Bitcoins are still easy to withdraw, so people are buying bitcoins in order to withdraw them.  Lots of people are moving those bitcoins to other exchanges in order to sell and withdraw there.
Also, IIRC, Coinbase uses Bitstamp as their reference price now.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:11:13
Your criticism expresses a valid point, though I think you're over stating the risk and under appreciating the benefit over most people's far inferior password habits.  Understand that I'm trying to target that demographic that uses no multi factor and passwords like "funnycat1987".  Most cracking algorithms don't target long padded passwords, because there's still enough to be gained by targeting much shorter and simpler passwords.  I think the best solution with the best balance between security and convenience is Lastpass with strong passwords and multi factor auth.  Padding is somewhere between that and obviously weak passwords.  In any event, when I get home I'll update the post to reflect your criticism.
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:27:27
If anyone in banking sees this, it'd be nice if there were a banking product designed for (what banks percieve as) high risk banking.  It'd be an account with higher than standard annual fees that you could only open with more than the typical KYC documents and proof that you have a CPA who helps you with tax compliance, etc.
There are at least 2 people in the US who would probably use something like that, haha

The NSA stuff is really troubling, to say the least, but I'm hopeful they have more to worry about than somebody with no criminal background, who's always paid his taxes, who's expressed intent to comply with tax obligations, and has never done anything shady with his bitcoins.  Admittedly, given the revelations of the past months, my hope may be misplaced.

So.....should I buy more or sell everything?
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:13:07
I'm sure the "wallet" terminology was picked up because bitcoin is intended to be an online medium of exchange, and talk of wallets is the way conventional systems work.  It allows people to talk about bitcoin in a way that's consistent with our conventional means of transacting online.
The trouble, however, is that obscures what's going on behind the scene.  And what's going on behind the scene is something very different than the way conventional systems work.  I think not understanding this on even a very basic non-technical level is a security risk for individual users that can compound into a problem for the entire idea.  If enough people fail to sufficiently appreciate what's going on behind the scenes to lead to enough compromised wallets, then the reputation of the whole project is hurt.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:57:17
I agree that bitcoin's technical complexity is and will be a problem for adoption.  Many of those who don't take the time to understand some of the basics will end up losing their bitcoins to theft, and this will, no doubt, be a big turn off.
I believe part of bitcoin's mainstream success, if it does become more widely adopted (which I don't think is a given), will depend on raising the collective security intelligence of the world's connected population.  A daunting task.

Jesus christ!  It's incredible to think that the network is estimated to be making over 1 trillion guesses...1000 times...twice...every second.
When I first found out about bitcoin the difficulty was around 50,000.  I started mining with a single 6990 around 80,000, IIRC.  The next difficulty target makes mining over 3000x more difficult than when I started.

As I understand it, because of the way the main bitcoin client processes blocks, you really don't want to store the blockchain on an SSD (lots of reads and writes, or something like that).  Traditional hard drives are better able to tolerate the blockchain, and, of course, HDD space is a lot cheaper than SSD space.  The blockchain could get almost 400x bigger than it is and I'd still be able to store it on my $90 HDD.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:03:55
Well, this is awesome.  The infrastructure is still young, the protocol is still being refined, and in the meantime, Max Keiser wants to pump the system to a valuation that it likely cannot presently support.  If bitcoin fails, and people are massively turned off of it, I think it will be right to say that Max Keiser played a significant role in its failure.

"Unlike gold or dollars or other things that have widely accepted utility, Bitcoin's price is determined entirely by what someone else is willing to pay for it."
Will somebody ELI5 how the exchange rate between gold and other things and dollars and other things is not determined entirely by what someone else is willing to pay for them?

He's more than merely a bad presenter.  I don't understand why it's been so easily forgotten that Amir was an active party to one the largest hacks/thefts in bitcoin's existence.  His irresponsibility helped with the loss of many tens of thousands of bitcoins, worth some millions of dollars at this point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:43:53
That is very doubtful.  What's more likely is that this is the beginning of the next big correction.  An enormous amount of money has left the MtGox order book ($6+ million at this point, see blockchained.com).  Much of that is probably due to a lot of early investors cashing out to pay off debt.  That cashing out by enough people will easily overwhelm the order book and probably signal a catastrophic crash, similar to June 2011.
This crash will burn many, many more people than in 2011, and therefore I expect any possible recovery will take many years, but there's a good chance that this turns enough people off of the idea of bitcoin that bitcoin will simply limp along and never fully recover.
TL;DR - The new high for bitcoin was reached, the price probably won't recover to those levels for many years (assuming it ever does).  This is potentially catastrophic.

...and you can use non-padded, arbitrarily long, mixed character passwords, because you don't have to worry about remembering them.
The downside is, obviously, that if your manager gets compromised (an attacker key logs your password and steals your two factor mechanism) then you're screwed.

I think he's looking for something a little different than what's been posted on the forums.  If I understand correctly, he wants a spreadsheet that can calculate the average price he'll pay to if he executes an order for X bitcoins.
We need to get the MtGox orderbook data in the spreadsheet and get all the data parsed out.  I don't know how to do it, but I've wanted to do it for a long time.

Weak hands are getting spanked right now.  And, unfortunately, as I've witnesses in movements like this since early 2011, most of the people losing out are those (1) new to bitcoin and (2) new to trading in general.  I'm sorry to break this to some of you, but those of us who can create "scary" sell walls just took a bunch of your bitcoins.

Yeah, the tax issue isn't a problem, as I said.  Our accountant is aware of the issue and has been helpful.  I haven't tried Bitstamp, but I'm open to trying it out.  The issue really isn't whether I can initiate a transfer from an exchange (Gox excepted, of course).  The issue is whether or not my bank will freak out when they get significant transfers from bitcoin related businesses (Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc.)

I agree with you that the vast majority of consumers won't want to wait days or weeks to download the whole blockchain to participate, and that's why online wallets are a useful service built on top of the fundamental protocol.
When I found out about the project in early 2011 most participants were talking like bitcoin would always be a system where its users contributed to the management of its infrastructure.  The vision of what bitcoin is and what it could be has shifted quite a lot since then.  The view now seems to be one of of an underlying protocol upon which services and additional infrastructure can be built.  Basically, the mostly crypto-anarchist early vision of bitcoin failed, in my view, to fully consider and appreciate bitcoin's full potential as a robust, flexible, and scalable system for world finance.
Among other things, what's revolutionary about bitcoin the protocol is that for the first time you can choose at what level you want to manage your own banking and/or participate in international financial infrastructure.  If you want to be completely responsible for the security of your own value, then you can do that, but at an upfront convenience cost.  For example, Using Armory you can manage an extremely secure air gapped private banking system that requires physical access to your computers with multiple levels of encryption to transact.  Or,  If you want to just jump in and use the system immediately, then you can choose among service providers who are building convenient services on top of the protocol (blockchain.info, coinbase, etc.).  There are trade-offs, but the world's traditional financial infrastructure doesn't even give you these options.  This is part of what gives bitcoin its value.

Hey OP, proudhon here, from bitcointalk.  Welcome to bitcoin.  I've been messing around in Coinbase recently and tried to send you a bitcoin last night, but Coinbase is having some trouble getting transactions out for some reason.  Since I'm impatient, I went ahead and sent you a bitcoin from a different wallet of mine.  Also, I'm not going to cancel the Coinbase transaction, so when they get their system working again you'll be getting another bitcoin.  Merry Christmas!
