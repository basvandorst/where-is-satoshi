Absolutely this. The actual "market cap" of bitcoin can only be reflected as a declining price in a panic sell off.  Their value remains constant over time. Trying to theoretically define it in dollars using a simple multiplication of coins X price is incredibly foolish. That price is just an estimate of what people's extremely emotionally tainted belief of the value is today. The ability to communicate value across the world or to carry millions of a currency in value with you in the form of a intangible brain wallet across borders is priceless, and that is what bitcoin gives us. So the price could be $3000 next week after a crash and it won't matter one bit because the utility of bitcoin never changed.

Actually no, they still lost value.  Even if they never converted it because bitcoin's buying power is still set by its worth in USD/EUR.  So if they needed those funds 2 months down the road to bay a bill, they would still be paying more bitcoin.

This is not unique to *bitcoiners*.  This happens every day all day on any financial show on television.  The market goes up or down or these numbers do x, y and z.  And in every situation the analysis team is ready to explain to you exactly why it all happened...which is all a bunch of hogwash.

It doesn't have to originate from the "Crypto Community" as you say.  What we have now is opportunity.  If there was a better way to use BTC for p2p lending, you or others might utilize it.  But to say that someone on the btc ground floor or avid promoter as it were is a necessary part of the equation is a bit pessimistic.  Go make the product you want if you aren't satisfied with what is available.  If you have any part of a resource chain at your disposal and believe you understand some nuance that could make bitcoin more useful, safer, etc. then, by God, go do it.  And if you are smart, figure out a way to monetize it.

You should read Taleb if you think you're accurately predicting anything. He has a whole series called Incerto. There's a 50/50 shot you'll be right, and if you are you'll use that as evidence of you using the correct method of prediction, when in fact it will have a 99.9% chance of just being attributable to randomness. You are confusing pure noise with signal.

Not by me. Doubling isn't a bubble. I strongly believe the true value of BTC to be well over $100,000, but emotions and ignorance will slow that ascension for quite a while. This is a bubble bc the bulk of the current investment is speculative and originates from people who don't understand BTC very well. So when things get shaky, they are gonna bail. It's not a bubble in the context of the theoretical objective value if everyone in the world had perfect knowledge and understanding of crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:27:35
Maybe that's likely but definitely not for certain. I owned 1100 at one point, but they tend to find their way into other people's pockets as the price increases.  But it would be very easy for someone to have purchased 200 bitcoins 5 years ago for not that much money and disconnect from bitcoin news until recently. That being said, your knee jerk reaction assuming they're full of shit is probably more jealousy than practicality.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:14:15
[I posted this to no avail 4 years ago after the bubble was around $40...]( (just read the top comment) People don't get it and never will. When the price is fully realized, its going to be a factor of 100, 1000, or even 10000 more than it is even today. To the HODLers like myself, keep doing what you're doing and wait for the world to change.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:40:10
Not just bc of the China thing. It's been a cycle and always will be a cycle that continues to happen on larger and larger scales. The day to buy is the day people start posting the suicide hotline number or it appears in the sidebar. Take it from someone that's been here long enough that I had to buy in with western union bc of the lack of access to trustworthy exchange sites.  This happens over and over again, and people can't imagine that 3 years from now we'll be seeing the same thing with an extra 0 or two before the decimal and it'll make this look like nothing.

How much it has risen in the last 90 days is what is troubling.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:17:18
500% run-ups make people a lot of money and so long time holders sell out to lock in their profit while speculative money buys in. The increase in price makes news and drives more speculative money in further increasing the price. It looks like a rocket ship so people start buying in before they miss the boat. Positive attitudes and hype aren't what keeps the price high. This is a short-term bubble.

I think you meant to describe the concept that the news has virtually no effect on the value of bitcoin, but can cause fluctuations in the price?
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:31:07
That's not at all what happened. No one has advised me to recruit anyone. I'm volunteering my time to try and organize people who have been scammed.
@_date: 2015-11-28 13:35:41


 
The combination of moving bitcoin out and the fluctuating price resulted in me believing I had more $$ tied up in the exchange.  I have 21 BTC in the exchange.  


I won't name a lawyer until he is totally on board.  


This is a rhetorical question.

I'd say future value will be based almost entirely on usability.  If Amazon starts accepting bitcoin, I'd be surprised if it stayed under $5k/btc.  I mean simply by buying bitcoin you insure yourself against inflation. Maybe its more esoteric than I give it credit for, but the housing bubble and bank account garnishing in Cyprus make btc look about 80% as attractive as gold to me.

This is going to be highly debatable in the near future.  If I converted some of my USD for hard Euros and then used those Euros to buy a plane ticket a year later after a much better exchange rate emerged...would I need to report that on my taxes...I don't think so.  Am I wrong about even this example?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:27:11
We'll see.  Before it hit $30 for a second time people were conservatively estimating the top to be $50.  After it spiked, people were talking about a 1:1 valuation with the US$ being over &gt;$100,000.  Everyone is an expert.  Right now smart money is buying in as fast and as cheap as possible.  If people at popular online trading hubs (i.e. Amazon, eBay, etc.) buy in and then announce they will start accepting bitcoin, it will be one the biggest tax free value gains in history, as they will never have to move out of Bitcoin to $ and thus never pay any capital gain.  That's what is continuing to drive the price up in theory to me. Your thoughts?
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:31:50
Well, after recent Congressional hearings, I think record keeping requirements for US based btc exchangers will make you very traceable.  So who doesn't like Europe?  My personal preference is Brussels...and citizenship isn't that hard if you are bringing in wealth fyi.

Don't take it to heart.  The fact that people automatically reject such an analysis is an indicator that you, and now at least me, have an edge up.  It is a dense and easily digestible bit of information that can inform our future decisions that they will not have...(haha!)  I initially invested in bitcoin because everyone had such a negative knee jerk reaction to something they didn't understand.  If everyone "knew" how good it was, it wouldn't have been so easy to make a boatload of money. 
P.S. Here is my Black Swan guess: Its a positive black swan too.  Some big, national retailer out there is going to realize how much they have to gain from accepting bitcoins (and holding on to at least a portion of those coins).  The new money made from bitcoin will make an example of what a good idea this is by shopping there.  Others will follow suit, and we will see a boom like you won't believe!

We are about to transition between the awareness and media phase.  IMO, we are going to see an unbelievable bubble as more and more retailers get on the bitcoin bandwagon.  True, it has received *some* media attention...but when you can buy groceries at Wal-Mart with btc, lord help us all.
