We chose to trade XBT against USD as we felt that this would bring greater liquidity and a tighter spread to the Australian Bitcoin market.
Funds can be deposited in AUD for free via BPAY and these are immediately converted by Independent Reserve into USD. Funds are converted into USD at a rate that is typically 2-3 % better than the buy rate offered by major Australian banks, as we use a specialized FX provider to do the conversion.
We are currently developing a solution which will allow us to have a combined liquidity pool in AUD, USD and other currencies but this is a month or two away from being production ready.

Bitcoin withdrawals are approved manually by back-end staff as a security precaution and also to allow for funds to be moved out of cold storage when required.

This is Adrian, Adam's long time friend and co-founder of [Independent Reserve](
Before he died, Adam was working on a book about Bitcoin. It is a book written with the general audience in mind, and is a project that Adam was very passionate about.
We will honour his legacy by completing the book and ensuring it is published in a fitting manner.
The Bitcoin Association of Australia has kindly offered to [collect Bitcoin donations]( which will be used to fund publishing costs of the book.
All proceeds from the sale of the book will be spent on promoting the use of Bitcoin and digital currency.
