I can't make anything. I'm just a guy. I want to hire people whose business it is to find people in states like Nigeria and go into dangerous situations with the intent to rescue these people. Private military contractors exist for a reason. Life isn't a movie but stuff doesn't get done unless people... Brave people... Do it. These girls have been held hostage for WEEKS by people the U.S. and Nigerian governments deal with on a political and economic basis regularly. Tweet the hashtag  donate a few bits, like and share the Facebook page, if you know any podcasts, bloggers, producers, journalists etc. Let me shoot them a press release... Just don't stop one of the only movements in the entire world that is making actionable progress to save these children!

We've reached out to: groupe-ehc a French PMC with extensive operational background in sub Saharan Africa, the ISDI a multinational Israeli led organization with a specialty in Intel; and other groups. This isn't a movie my friend. We are looking a to hire a company that provides a certain type of service. That's it. Its not complicated.

Thanks. If there's anything you need. Get at me.  It'd really help if you'd tweet it with  and like/ share Facebook.com/bitcoinrescue

I disagree. Its exactly because they are so large that finding the girls is possible. This is an exercise in coordinating clandestine intelligence gathering with extraction or negotiation. Its easy for a local one man private eye to infiltrate the large organization. If we connect with the right people we can be effective and most important QUICK. Most likely the Nigerian government has some idea where the girls are, but are so intertwined/afraid/in collusion with boco haram that they can't oppose them. We can. People that stand up to bullies, even if its only with their money.

Great why don't you fly out for a conference and pitch me four or five contingencies.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:23:05
Anyone know a podcast or blog that might be open to talking about this idea?
Does anyone have any ideas about paramilitary organizations to get in contact with?

An actual operation may not be possible, but trying to help people that no one else is helping can't be described as anything but heroic.

I'm a cab driver in Oklahoma City. I accept bitcoin. If you want a ride I'm  or call/text 4058385242 
Also I'm only charging a flat $2 per mile instead of the normal rate if you use Bitcoin

The organization has already reached out to several PMCs for service quotes, consultation, and references to specialty operators in the region... This is happening people. We just need donations and to spread the word
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:26:32
You're letting your imagination get away from you.  we must consult with EXPERTS on the viability of a campaign. You nor I is qualified to discount the possibility.

If you're for real, what steps would you suggest to make this happen?
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:20:14
This is important. Let's make this happen together
If you'll use  and tweet  and link Facebook.com/bitcoinrescue I know we can at least elevate the moral status of Bitcoin, and at most... Rescue 200+ little girls.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:03:56
You want 4+ million bucks... You can hop a plane to OKC... You got some series selling to do. Are you a one man army, do you have a team?  Weapons, transport? You got your own arsenal? 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:00:53
I've set up a Facebook page: 
Go there to donate
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:16:34
You can already hire killers with bitcoin. What I want is to hire heroes.

Is used something you'd be interested in? I've been in contact with a couple girls from and if they get a box as a gift, they'll send the gift-giver a special pair.

We don't even have to be successful. The campaign and positive publicity it generates is what we want... Of course if we were successful well that's 200 little girls saved... Shouldn't we try just because its right?
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:31:35
I think a lot of people are over estimating what we're trying to do here. 200+ Girls are being held hostage. It takes a lot of people to hold that many prisoners in the jungles or wherever. Captor have to make supply runs and stuff.  Finding the girls is as simple saying a sentance, "the girls are here.."  is going to hire someone who can that sentence out of one of the innumerable people who is part of boko haram. One of these companies employs an ex CIA who has a friend that can get the answer to "where are the girls?" That's it. That's all we want. It may cost 400btc to get that answer... But we CAN get that answer

There are real publicly traded mercenary groups for hire. Think black-water. If we push bitcoin as a source of good and compassion it will do wonders.

I know bitcoin holders can afford it. I myself bought 20btc when they were $13 each... If we all put our efforts together we can afford "millions" in fees without actually losing much at all and doing a whole heck of a lot of good.

Hi. This is neat. Help me build up to my first "whole" coin.
@_date: 2013-01-01 05:42:06
Here's the problem. I get that the bitcoin is broken down into smaller pieces scientifically. dimes, pennies, millies, satoshi. But that doesn't help the situation. See if a laptop costs 50 BTC, the sentence becomes the laptop costs 50 Bitcoin. If it is 50.4, the sentence is the laptop costs 50 bitcoins and 4 bitdimes. If 50.45, is the sentence laptop costs 50 bitcoins 4 bit dimes and 5 bit penny ? Or 50 bitcoins and 45 bit penny? And what if there's a Ham sandwich it costs.  .074 Bitcoin? Does that equal 7 bitpennies and 4 millibitcoins? See we need 1 alternative and since no real item are less than a cent I propose we find the BTC equivalent which right now is  the last decimal spot in this number 0.07399 BTC the hundred-thousandths spot. So we count the change of Bitcoin from there. I still nominate the "Quant" so a dollar equals 7399 Q (for Quants ) 50¢=3700Q etc. So an 50.45 BTC  item reads 50 Bitcoins and 45hundred Quants. Now we can all communicate in a standard, easy to understand fiscal Bitcoin language.

No it's just some old lady who couldn't remember the word bitcoin. And just made up a funny name that vaguely sounds like it. 
@_date: 2013-01-01 13:56:40
The problem I see with that is that it's too formal. People make mental connections by linking the image of an item to the image of some number. Point zero four three one nine nine Bitcoin is 1:too long to be the same as a candybar 2:too cold and mathlike to be turned into an image, scientific numbers by their nature or perhaps by our many years of primary, and secondary indoctrination, imply a required precision.3:a turnoff to would be adopters because frankly it's not sexy.
An easily identified and most important easily communicated image of a number is needed to propagate use and success of Bitcoin. An image of   .03497 that I can draw for myself and others -quickly - is 3500 Quants. Read simulacra and simulation
