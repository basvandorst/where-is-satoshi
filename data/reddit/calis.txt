You've squandered your opportunity. You should have talked him into bringing back iGoogle.

Those things always turn me off of a website. If I can't even look at what the page is about without an annoying box or popup, they obviously don't want me there.

Or perhaps you need to own 22 bitcoin.

4. Just skim the headlines like I do and only open the thread if it seems interesting.

It has happened at least a few dozen times. I never get it updated. I've been trying for weeks.

Last night before I went to bed I rebooted and started it up. At 7AM it said it had 4 hours to go. That's a great deal longer than it has ran any time before. I'd check on it now, but I have something messed up in my xrdp settings apparently :(

I"m not going to question if OP should be in an advanced placement class or not, but over this topic? No. The answer here is that the teacher needs to come to grips with what an 8th grade student knows and thinks about. The learning disabled kids in 8th grade should be writing about washing a car or cleaning their room...not a normal 8th grader. 
I tell everyone I know that the reason kids always think they are smarter than their parents is because they ARE...not speaking of wisdom, but intelligence. We want it to be that way though. I want my kids to be smarter than I am (and they are in many ways) so that our species can continue to advance. We need to get dinosaurs (or at least dinosauristic thought) out of our school systems.
That being said, I would say it is quite likely that that OP would certainly benefit from an advanced class.

I was trying to come up with a humorous or inspirational story to "win" some free BTC tip...but was unable. In retrospect, give that BTC tip to someone that doesn't have any...spreading it around probably does more good.

Fuck you, I *do* have a crystal ball. It's in a box in my garage along with some runes and tarot cards.

Awesome. Our paths cross again. I one time recorded and downloaded one of his shows because he forgot to set his DVR. Then I RAR'd it into 4 or 5 parts and spread it all over the web so I could send it to him. He even said thanks, but I'll bet he thought I was some sorta nutjob the way I sent that file....it was the best I could do.
