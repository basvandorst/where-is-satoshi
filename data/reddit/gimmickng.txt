no, i'm not. why? what did i say that made me sound like a troll? i don't know much about bitcoin (except that i'm kicking myself for not buying it earlier in 2013-ish) and I mostly only use online wallets. The fact that I keep hearing about bter being hacked every now and then makes me wonder whether they're very trustworthy to keep whatever little bitcoin i put into their funds or whatever.

(Seeing as this has got more attention than the other ones, I have a question which I reposted):
I wonder if it's safe to use BTER now. The only reason I signed up there is because their "interest" feature seemed appealing, should I recover any bitcoins I have (if I lost any) and switch back to Coinbase or similar wallets?

all electronics contain gold and/or silver as it's a wonderful conductor. it's also nonreactive, so it has some applications in chemistry - i forget which.
