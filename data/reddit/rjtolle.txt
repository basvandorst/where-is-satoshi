Congratulations you married a complete moron. 
Don’t have kids with this woman.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:21:03
Oh boy - don’t use this website people. The scammers will never stop.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:42:34
How do we get round these pricks 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:55:58
What about the shadow government spending in the billions that are off the books.
Edit: sorry I misspelled trillions 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:12:02
Yeah exactly. They’re going after the average joe’s crypto profits but they turn a blind eye to companies like Amazon where they aren’t taxed at all. Billion’s untaxed.
I appreciate hospitals, roads, military etc - very grateful for those, but imagine how better our society would be if they spent more on the things that matter. A society of  abundance instead of greed.

You’re going to get a knock at your door after a month asking wtf are you doing with your utilities.

Downvoted because this a totally useless thread that clogs up what once used to be a pragmatic board. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:22:29
We can do that ourselves. I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:32:27
Nah honestly dude this board used to be a decent place to read people’s thoughts on bitcoin but now normies feel the need to post their every single thought here. 
Next time before making a post and hitting the submit button just pause for a second and consider if it’s important or valuable to anybody. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:56
Downvoted because this board does not need threads like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:04:16
I meant shadow spending, by the government.
Trillions in vague military spending where  the books aren’t balanced.
500m spent on Al Qaeda propaganda
Not to mention bailouts of the banks which I don’t need to cite.
Not wanting to argue with you but the governments spending is not transparent at all.  
I’m pretty sure they found a clone Hubble telescope somewhere. They built two - unknown to the tax payers. Millions upon millions they just decided to spend without letting anyone know - on something that isn’t even used.
See where I’m coming from?

This is begging right?
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:43:18
This has been answered ad nauseam
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:58:07
Why would someone want to let everyone know this?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:16:35
Does liking something immediately mean that you share the exact same opinion as it? Is this the world we live in.
Maybe he was just sitting on his couch at come getting blazed, eating Doritos and reading Twitter. He saw a total bullishit arbitrary post maybe chuckled or whatever while farting and just hit the like button not giving a shit, continuing to not giving a fuck about anything because he’s rich bitccchhh. 
He isn’t sitting at a desk right now wearing a suit stroking a cat like some sort of evil rich ceo guy.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:09:32
Let’s be honest nobody is surprised by this
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:19:36

I think these comments are dangerous and they need to stop
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:36:39
Thanks dude perfect answer. 
21m seems to be the perfect number considering how many people there are on the planet?
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:37:36
Thank you

You don't know that fuckboy, you're coercing newbies into buying a volatile currency for your own gain. Psychopathy at work here.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:08:51
lol this is why bitcoin is never going to be mainstream ever. This is like putting all your money into a glass box and leaving it in the middle of a city. Oh and the box and the money are made of sugar so when it rains you're fucked.
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:08:22
How many bitcoins we talking here, bro?
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:59:06
