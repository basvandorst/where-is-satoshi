Haven’t withdrawn FIAT in ages. Last time was about 3 months ago. And took about 5 days and 5 attempts.

Why dont They work? Is the Connection blocked? Or does the Exchange not allow people from Turkey. 
If its the first. Try setting up a VPN from a country which allows iT. Like here in The Netherlands. 
If its the second try finding a Exchange Where you dont need to verify. 
Hope that helps. 
Have fun with Erdogan

Takeaway: 
Read up before you buy crypto. Litteraly almost everywhere it says don’t leave your money in a exchange account. 
And about the 2fa. Duh. 
And check out internet before selecting a exchange. Poliniex is all over there with comments about their terrible support. 
Sucks balls but could all easily have been prevented. 
Hope you get your money back. ✌️

No I think you misunderstood me there. Everything is always in a offline wallet here. I never leave my coins in a third party wallet. I’m not a day trader but there is no use. 
Besides that. If there is a fork with multiple coins. Coinbase could decide not to give you the coins from the forked new coin. 
So we are on the same page. Just wanted to explain, not to you but to people who haven’t read up on segwit2x, what the possibility is.

Actualy you are right. Bad sunday. Apologies to OP. 
But still, you wouldnt just call a bank and say give me an account number and start transfering your money there. You would first find some info about the bank. 
That’s why I don’t understand why people don’t do their research with crypto.

Get a hardware wallet or an offline wallet which only you have the keys of. Then let everything play out and wait until there is enough information on how to use your coins without danger of replay.

First of all. My condolences. Even though it will be good for my electricity bill as the UK will illuminate the Netherlands as it burns. 
If Bitcoin is widely known, easy accessible and safe by 2019 I agree. At this moment I think most people won’t trust it enough or find it to difficult to put their life savings in Bitcoin.

Again please provide me a source. As per  my info, which I might have misunderstood or misread or is just wrong, Segwit has nothing to do with block size. Only with the way the size in the blocks is used and certain transactions which can be resolved outside of the blocks. The segregated whitness.

I checked the Exchanges I work with But All have adress verification. 
Try bitonic. Bought Some coins from them throug something only Dutch people can use. So its definitly legit company. (Dutch company). But They do also have an Exchange. Their website says its available in whole of europe.

~$3885 is correct

I never had any problems with Kraken so far. Response time is terrible though. But that’s the same everywhere

Everything I read says the blocks are limited to 1mb. This because before they were 20mb and spamming these disrupted the processing so they decided tot limit them to 1 mb. If I’m wrong please provide a link to the correct information so I can read up.

Was only talking about the Satoshi limit, which you confirm. The rest I read. For the rest my BTC are in a wallet until after the fork. I’ll just watch how it plays out. 
Only point 4 I have a little note: you don’t have to change. That’s why it will fork. If both forks have equal strength you don’t have to change. If the 2x fork comes out as the winner then you will have to change.
