They have access to the full live games, full dvr games, condensed dvr games, live nfl network, live nfl redzone, and access to games for the past 4 years. Plus they seem to be cheaper. $25 for a full year or $38/90 days via sportsaccess. I have cable provider information for ESPN channels to watch college football and college basketball and thats all I watch.

I think ive figured it out. Idk why they need to make it so simple that it makes it more complicated.

Yeah the same login gets me access to fox sports as well, then CBS has their livestream for free on their website of games. So NFL2go just fits the pro football fix. I used to pay for gamepass (service they pull the live feeds from) but that was $200+ a year.

yeah the smaller schools for those networks dont get much coverage unless their playing a top school.

Its actually NFL2Go. I have access to all other sports I watch but use that for HD NFL games. The $25 gets me access until the HOF game next season and works on my Roku. SportsAccess does not.

I signed up for circle on their website but cant figure out how to use their site. When I click add money it take me to add my card or bank account, I click card enter the info and it says it added it but when I add money it takes me back to the same page.

Thanks but I finally got the $3.70 last night after about 2 hours of messing with it.
