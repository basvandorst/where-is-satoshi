A Harvard professor came on and explained that the blockchain was a giant spreadsheet, with nothing but addresses. Everyone could view it, but no one would know who owned what address. Additonally anyone could add to the spreadsheet by sending or receiving bitcoins to any address and creating new addresses. 
A lot easier and better fleshed out than "a public ledger". Which is the typical explanation given. The last eli5 I saw about Bitcoin used quite a bit of tech jargon to explain that. Which is fine, if whomever is reading it understands all that.

If I had even a single bit I most certainly would. Also I don't use Twitter, but that's a small problem.

Ok I am extremely new to bitcoin. So obviously I have questions.
I know a wallet holds your coins. But what do addresses do? Are they like pockets of a wallet? Holding some of your coins, but not all?
If I have old machines lying around can I use them to mine? I know mining is where you confirm blocks of transactions. Also are there pre-made programs to help you mine?
I have my wallet backed up and passphrase protected. If someone cracks my pass phrase can I restore my wallet from my back up and get my coins back?

Ok. Im a noob to bitcoins. What is going on here and how is it bad?

I guess they really did clone the server, whoever they are.

I was able to log inti d2.vu no problem. So I guess they cloned my username and password from the old demoniod?
Too bad for them there is no way in hell to get into that email I signed up with years ago, seeing as it no longer exists.

bitcoin-qt. I have nothing in this wallet. I was installing it on my main computer to add my other addresses to, but I haven't done so yet.
