Has anyone done any research into what block-size would become prohibitive to running a node? From what I understand, it's a connection speed problem.
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:42:10
Interesting. Is there a cheaper way to get cash into a Simple account?

The bandwidth problem get's strawmanned a lot. The real argument is: Consider a scenario where &gt;50% of the hashpower existed on one side of a bandwidth bottleneck. Let's give this bottleneck a hard limit such that if block size goes above 10MB, propagation time would be so high that orphan rate on the &lt;50% side would skyrocket. When orphan rate skyrockets, the side of the internet with &gt;50% hash power will effectively become bitcoin.
Idk if that helps. But essentially, we already have that bottleneck in the GFC, and I thought I saw someone do some analysis that the real cap would be around 8MB or so. I don't know though. I think it would inevitably happen somewhere before the network got to 1GB blocks.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:31:48
No sorry, i meant it was unreadable because autocorrect changed a bunch of words. No big deal. 
Anyway, I still think you are misunderstanding the argument. Let's look at your scenario:




Alright, let's say node 1 is on the &gt;50% hashpower side (strong side) and node 2 (N2) is on the weak side. Now, you can't assume they have the same hash so whoever has the stronger hash will win. Since the strong side has more hashpower, lets assume Node 1 will win (since it will overall). But there is a difference in propagation rates. 
So now both nodes, having found a block start working on the next block. But they are working on two slightly different chains. One minute in (because of the slow prop-times):
 - N2 gets N1's block, realizes it is working on a weak chain and dumps all it's work. Starts over working N1's chain.
 - N1 gets N2's block, sees that it is weaker, and discards it, continues working on N1's chain.
Now, this won't happen every time, but it will statistically happen more often than the other way around. The strong side of the chain is constantly working on stronger chains, and discarding less frequently than the weak side. Every time the strong side gets a block it forces the weak side to discard work. This means that the strong side get's much more advantage than you would normally expect from its 51% hashing power. 
Do compact blocks, thin blocks, and weak blocks fix this? I haven't analysis either way, so I can't say.

Is that a real problem? Datacenters taking mining equipment?
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:41:55
True. But it seemed your argument was that trusting datacenters is less important than trusting asic makers. I was just curious if that was something that happened often. Especially because it isn't all that expensive to make something smart prop right?
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:04:10
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:45:25
Well, you want a dedicated computer for sure. Nodes should be on all the time ideally, because transactions/blocks happen continuously.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:11:26
Maybe. I still wonder what it would take for BTC to reach stability against fiat. In theory, if that ever happened, we would start thinking about fiat as being unstable vs Bitcoin (since BTC has predictable inflation). For some reason I think that that is unlikely to happen after a massive pump and dump. 
But I don't invest shit. I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:25:52
Thank you for your opinion. I do comment with support for segwit on Because I care about our community. 
Honestly, I often get argued Down Rabbit holes that don't answer my questions. 
BTC has become anti segwit, and I'm not sure why. Segwit is good for everyone. I'm all for being anti censorship, but I also think some good ideas come from being able to filter verifiably bad ideas. So a balance needs to be struck. Where do we strike the balance?
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:32:28
I get that your nodes are waiting on a hash from you. I don't think you read my explanation. If your node is on the weak side of a bottle neck, it won't tell your miner to start looking for a different block until later than the strong side.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:47:38
What? Vps should be fine. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:07:10
Segwit comes with an effective blocksize increase. I agree we need a blocksize increase. But let's do it via softfork first then let's talk about hf increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:03:50
One quick thought, that I haven't totally thought through: say it splits like you said with BU taking 80% hash power. The remaining 20% have to suffer until difficulty change aka for up to 2016  blocks. But...They also get every block. So where originally, they would statistically have gotten 20%of the 2016 blocks in two weeks, they now get 100%of the blocks in 2months. Economically, aren't they un affected?
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:15:20
Miners have to connect to a trusted node, that is true. It's not really true that "nodes are just waiting on a hash" since the miners decide which transactions go into that hash. 
Anyway, I've laid out the actual argument. You don't have to accept it. Just wanted you to know that your "I could go up to 30MB blocks on my connection" doesn't address the actual argument.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:53:25
Yeah. I worded my comment stupidly; I meant almost the oppoaite. Sorry. I mean to say you think DIStrusting datacenters is more important than DIStrusting chip makers. 
I'm just thinking out loud if that's true. I suppose it would probably be fairly easy to notice if a chip maker isn't making chips right. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:54:46
Holy crap that is almost unreadable. 
You say that you just need a node on each side of the bottleneck. Well yeah, if there were only 2 nodes, that wouldn't be so bad. But there are thousands or tens of thousands on each side. And if one side can replicate to itself faster than the other side, they will start on new blocks quicker. 
Also, my thinking isn't getting controlled. I was pointing out that you are attacking a strawman. I'm also saying, it will be an issue at some point. We shouldn't dive head first into a non-solution, lets look at solutions. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:29:25
Hmm. Idk that I agree that blocks are going to go to 10k with LN, or any other payment channel. We might stall here with 750k blocks, but I doubt we ever get down to 10k. We might need bigger blocks in the near future, but I think we as a community don't quite understand what "need" means yet.  
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:18:10
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:19:16
That is extremely interesting. My first thought was no miner would ever do that. But when voting on bigger blocks, a miner could be getting more fees from more transactions. So essentially with this system we are incentivising the block size to raise whenever the expected TRUE fee increase is greater than the number of burned coins. Now the question is, how do we know how many coins need to burn for a given size increase? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:37:53
The problem with extension blocks is not that it is a softfork. It is that it would need to go through and even longer development/testing/acceptance lifetime than segwit. And segwit took over 2 years. I don't think anyone has even started on ext blocks. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:46:40
So in the end, was it decided that it wasn't worth the effort? Or has work started on this?
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:09:29


Segwit has been in the making for years. Ext Blocks is cool, lets keep working on it. But it isn't tested, and it isn't ready. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:12:10
Not that I have really thought it through, but I wonder if tying block-size to time is the best method we can come up with. Ideally, it should be tied to some unspammable marker of need to increase blocksize. Ideally, it should tie to bandwidth, since network speed is probably the biggest problem. But bandwidth never really shows up in the protocol as a number to calculate against. 
Just spitballing here, Maybe we could make the miners "pay" for a blocksize increase: they vote in the block (set one of the signalling bits), but only count the vote if the mined coins do not move from the mined address for X blocks. I think this would work for fighting against larger pools trying to vote out small competition, because the larger your operation, the more money you would have to lock. I'm not sure how that would work with P2Pool mining though.

Eh, but bitcoin disappear over time, so there will never be 21million btc. $1mil per bitcoin does seem high though.  
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:59:52
Well, I'm going to ignore your ancap musings because we aren't discussing politics. Market forces isn't an answer. If you set up a system where miners have to make an assurance contract to burn X btc from each block for Y blocks, we need to set X and Y beforehand. Otherwise, miners will set X to be 1cent and Y to be 1 block. 
Now, we could set X to be a percentage of the reward, say, 10%. And Y is less important, so 2048 blocks. But why is X 10%? No reason. Maybe 50% is better? But who decides? If you are trying to reach consensus, you have to find a way of hardcoding X. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:22:30
More than likely this is just a fancy password. Encryption is generally encoding a message so it can't be read. And Bitcoin uses cryptographic signatures, which is the inverse of encryption, using encoded messages to prove an author. Neither are related to the concept of passwords, unless you abstract all the way out to access control. In which case this is saying:
Ownership of an asset requires control of access to the asset. 
Still, looks like a cool solution to that problem.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:24:48
Isn't that worse? That means instead of having to compromise 100% of the PoW algorithms (1 of 1), you only have to compromise 20% PoW algos (1 of 5).

Maybe that's true...but it is completely irrelevant. 
You said EC has only 1 protocol rule change. I said there is more than 1, because EB and AD are part of the EC protocol. Doesn't really matter how often they "come into play".

This is not true. It also adds excessive depth and acceptance depth signaling to the protocol. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:48:02
Schnorr is a signature scheme. So,  a new altcoin could in theory implement it without segwit though it's unlikely a brand new altcoin would forgoe segwit. But Bitcoin could not implement schnorr without a hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:42:07
Sorry. Gonna call you out on this. The base layer to the internet (tcp/udp) is faster the web (http). This is fact. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:53:39
In a certain sense. The original transaction format says which parts need to be signed, and which parts need to be hashed. Since the signatures end up being hashed, the transaction id (the hash) changes. Generally, you do this all before publishing the transaction, but with certain multisig opcodes (which came later), that may not be true, which creates the malleability. It doesn't change the inputs or outputs though, so it doesn't really break anything unless your wallet software relies on the TID to be constant. 
So, it's not really meant to be malleable. But it is technically part of the design. All segwit does is move the signatures outside the hash. I could be wrong on some details, but that is my understanding.
Side note: Transaction Malleability and ECDSA malleability are two different things (though they are somewhat related). And with Segwit, you can do a softfork that enables Schnorr signatures, which don't have the malleability that ECDSA does. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:18:04
Ooh gotcha. You have no idea what you are talking about.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:55:14
You weren't talking to me, but for the sake of argument: to have any real utility, bitcoin needs to solve the scaling problem and the confirmation time problem. Btc can only have max 3.3 t/s (scaling problem) as stands and  those transactions in a best case scenario will take an average of 10 minutes to confirm (conf time problem). The scaling problem is partially and temporarily solved by raising block size. The conftime problem is not solved. 
With segwit, you have another temporary solve to scaling and no change to conftime. So same real benefit as blocksize increase. But...you allow for Layer 2 networks to get some actual development interest/funding/etc. And these can potentially solve both problems. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:32:00
It will be 1mb blocks at day one. It will be a slow increase to 2.7mb over the course of a few months likely. But transactions should time out after 3 days. So you can resubmit then as a segwit trans No? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:02:26
Oh? What is the purpose of transaction malleability?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:01:42
Thanks! So the 40% number comes from the fact that most multisig will be close to 2of2, Thus condensing 2 sigs to 1?

If you have Comcast, aka the most common isp in the US, you have a datacap of 1TB. I BLASTED through my limit the month i spun up my home node (1.3TB). The block chain is over 120gb now, and that first DL is brutal. It must have been easily 600gb, cuz my previous usage was only 3-400gb a month.

I could of course Google bat wing evolution and post a breakdown of how the finger elongated and lost bone density, but I didn't think you came to a bitcoin forum to talk about cool animal facts. I figured you were referring to evolution in general. In general, species transition slowly, with each morphology having some use. 
Also, I don't really see how any of this is relevant to bitcoin or the OP. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:01:47

@_date: 2017-05-19 04:33:04
In general, a very wealthy person has a wealth manager. In the future, WMs will need to understand bitcoin and these changes. So they would cause the person to split their holdings on such a way as to minimize risk. The situation you are describing would only happen to a strangely lazy/stupid/gambling billionaire.

There are mining pools, but even then you won't get any money with only CPUs. You need ASICs nowadays.

@_date: 2017-07-22 17:16:57
Right. if you go up two levels, you did say that. I replied specifically to the comment where you argued that LN causes centralization and only quoted from that. 


Payment channels aren't bad period. They are the only thing that could be considered "True Scaling". Increasing the blocksize is not "Scaling" because it would be linear at best, and sub-linear most likely. Blocksize changes also don't help the fundamental problems with widespread adoption which is that transactions need 10 minutes average to confirm, and require fees relative to the byte-size of the transaction. Payment channels are the only things that fix this. 
I'm all for an upgrade to 2MB too. But I wish y'all wouldn't rush it. We as a community have been working on segwit for years now with myriads of tests and copious amounts of planning. We should do the same for a block-size increase. And I know the politics of the issue are strange. But the big-blockers need to quit bitching and plan a change the right way. No more closed-door deals. Build it in the open. Plan it in the open. Build community support. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:57:08
Oh gotcha. You are referring to the interim period, where reorgs can cause transactions to be rolled back. It would be temporary though. 
If someone held a billion coins before the splitting period, and don't transact them, they will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:15:53
Hmm...how do schnorr sigs reduce transaction fees? I thought they were more for complex multisig actions
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:35:10


This is going to be true of ANY payment channel. Fundamentally, you will need to lock funds to get a payment channel advantage. Otherwise, how would you get funds into the channel? Sure, you could make a new transaction every time you want funds in the payment channel, but then why even make a payment channel?
And to prove this is true, think about the payment channel you (likely) use almost every day: VISA. You can't hold cash and use VISA. You have to "lock" your cash into a bank or credit union account. While it is in that bank account, you cannot use the cash accept through the payment channel. 
Knowing this, let's examine your other assertions:


Maybe. Maybe not. The only thing keeping me from getting multiple bank accounts at multiple banks is...oh wait. I do have multiple bank accounts at multiple banks. And now with other apps like Venmo, PayPal, Cash, Dwolla, etc, I have a bunch of payment channels open.


Yep. I would want one of those too. 


Yeah, but many more transactions would have been on chain without it. Though I do agree that the timing kinda sucks since they are all racing to get on the chain. But hey, at least there is recourse. If a bank suddenly went under, you'd be screwed (well, FDIC, but that's different). 
I appreciate you bringing up potential flaws. It's always good to think these things through. But I think your arguments work against any potential payment channel. And because of that, they don't work at all. There will always be some advantage to payment channels, specifically in speed and fees. And you shouldn't stop people from wanting to take advantage of these features. That would be blocking progress.
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:02:01
You are mostly correct. But isn't that off topic? The question I asked was what benefit malleability has, not if segwit completely solves malleability. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:41:46
Every transaction initially converted to segwit trans? No. But the incentives that segwit offers via the discount make segwit transactions initially cheaper. So many will use it. Over time the discount goes away. And people still use segwit transactions because there is no harm and the tid stays the same which is nice for wallet software
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:19:10
I think the person you were replying to was saying that they think you can't logically claim that. I.e., you can say that on chain scaling is best, but you'd be misinformed.

It's possible to erase your computer and lose all your bitcoins forever. This is good. This a feature. It's up to you to make backups. 
And there are very few, if any cases that a fork purposely steals coins. Even less likely for a soft fork. Plus, all they would need to do is read a little and figure out how to avoid that scenario. If they don't secure their coins properly, that's their own fault. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:13:40

And what code did they change "last minute"?
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:21:49
I had been thinking about this too, and I think it definitely could. Though, maybe not with colored coins. I think the biggest problem would be distribution of the votes. In an anonymous system, you would need to make sure that each voter definitely gets 1 votecoin. One way to do this would be to do regular vote registration, but the voter also gives the state/municipality their public address, and the state/mun. sends them the votecoin. Then, come voting day, the voter sends the vote to the address of their candidate. 
Advantages would be that there would be no way to miscount the votes as presumably everyone who wanted to would be running a votechain node. It would also allow for cool things like voting by proxy. You could then as a voter sign up for a PAC by forwarding them your vote coins. This sounds kind of scary until you realize that most people don't have the time to research every politician, nor should they devote the time. 
The biggest disadvantage is that this then requires that you have both a computer and an internet connection. It is also very difficult for the average non-tech-savvy person to comprehend. If bitcoin gains popularity, I think the average person will become more comfortable with crypto-addresses, and start understanding that they are very secure. 
All in all, I think it could work. The implementation details would be very important though, as a poor implementation would be worse off than our current system.
