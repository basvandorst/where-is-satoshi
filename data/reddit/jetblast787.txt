Any graphs? One thing lacking at the moment is graphs for android based trackers

What is causing the double drop in the past couple of days? Are they linked to the same reason? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:58:20


Doesn't this mean that the government can reverse any positive decision they have had so far in the future?
Also how soon till we see new exchanges opening up based in the UK? I've been itching to buy and sell from a UK vendor!

That increases the price

Good bot
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:11:13
Uh guys, should we tell him?

Does it really matter if we do or don't know who created bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:59:56
Also I might be a little too confident in buying now... Bitcoins anonymous anyone?

Armory with paper and offline digital backups within truecrypt containers
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:15:26
I've noticed in the past two days there has been a very sluggish movement in the price, with sometimes barely any movement. Any reasons behind it?
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:57:30
I hope there's a temporary drop some time soon. I brought some last week when it was around $740 and now regret not getting more than the measly 0.1 I have. It sounds greedy I know, but its all I could afford then
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:02:49
Also can someone give me the easiest way to buy btc from the UK please? I've brought some via localbitcoins, but that was when the price wasn't so far off market prices.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:59:29
Let also hope there will be easier ways to buy BTC with £. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:09:26
They better start blocking amazon for selling various items that can be used for illegal activities such as knives!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:13:45


They already are
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:51:33
Sad I only got 0.1btc last week when it was at $748. It's not easy obtaining them in the UK at all :(

Is having 3 armory encrypted backups in truecrypt containers on 3 separate usb sticks (one being used regularly on various computers) plus on paper backup enough? [Serious]
plus of course the two factor authentication
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:25:05
I would buy more now but unfortunately I was dumb enough to buy £500 last night at around £790.... Really been tempted to buy more and equal the amount I have currently to 1BTC, but can't afford to spend anymore. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:47:36
This. Also, why didn't you wait for the amount to be deposited into your account fully before releasing the coins?
