This guy's writing style is very hard to follow.  Nothing concise or convincing.
My takeaway is that he's mad about Augur raising so much money in their sale.

This guy's posts are basically unreadable.  Compare to anything written by Vitalik, who's writing is concise and to the point.   This guy talks in circles and tangents all day long.
Painful to read.

This is great news for Ethereum.  Co-founder of Ethereum now CDO of the TSX.
R3 and 11 Banks now using Ethereum to move assets.  Will be good when he recommends Ethereum as a technology platform to adopt.
Probably this is in the wrong subreddit.
I mean, we could put a turing complete scripting language into Bitcoin to eliminate the Ethereum threat -- but we're too busy in a 2MB civil war

 The trickle code appears to have been designed to make IP tracing of transaction origins harder and breaks out transaction IP origin tracking capability.
Once they have convinced miners to use Classic's codebase, they'll start implementing things like this.  Hence the "Let's do it after the fork".... Very surprised that this is being downvoted.

After seeing all this hard work, we should keep in mind that Many of these core devs have indicated they will quit if Classic fork wins.  
Food for thought.

Actually, they cannot all 'cross work on all' because they all have different consensus rules.

Hopefully the new devs as Classic wouldn't be stupid enough to merge something like this.

This must have taken forever to put together. Good job.

All of what you said is false.

Other comments from  on freenode, but I'm not sure if the channel is logged. 
Frankly, I don't blame them.  If they feel Bitcoin will no longer be decentralized or able to maintain privacy for users, why would they be interested in contributing? 
They could do a crowdsale and start a new coin.

Ethereum is being used by 11 Banks. Not bitcoin.  I can see why bitcoin maximalists would be worrying.
@_date: 2016-01-27 21:19:39
Ether was $0.33 in the sale. Now its $2.50. In a few months, after Chinese exchanges list ETH, it will go to $25.
11 Banks now using Ethereum.  It's obviously a good investment at this point. Only $200m vs Bitcoin $6B.  Lots of room to grow. 
This is obvious. 
No point in being mad about it.

No he didn't.  Coinbase just decided to process a transaction that by definition wasn't secure.  They took their own risk in doing that.  They should have waited for 1 confirmation.
Also no intent to defraud because he immediately offered to return the $10.

Name-calling is a sign of desperation.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:29:03
Do it in a neutral forum where ideas are researched and vetted based on 3rd party analysis, and devs can reach a consensus in a non hostile environment.  Rather than what we have now, all-out war in the open.  With mobs on both sides, name calling, and all sorts of nonsense like Mike's NYT article.

Is there any evidence that shows how the hack happened?  Even with the backdoor, how did this shitcoin client have access to a system with 13,000 BTC in it, that should have been in cold storage?  There's no way they were stupid enough to run their main BTC wallet and shitcoin clients on the same server.
