Greetings, Hassan
I happen to be a Nigerian prince Bitcoin investor. I am able to fill your request, only problem is my funds are stuck on coinbase. If you wire 100btc to me first I'll be able to sell you upwards of 400 btc a day for as long as you want!!

Leave recovery instructions in a safety deposit box and give the key to a lawyer who's in charge of your will.

You might notice you can log in to gdax with your coinbase account..... Hmmmmm
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:31:28

Still lots of money to be made in the crypto space. You should learn what you're investing in before investing in anything and expect 10000% gains. You could gain a lot but you could also lose a lot.
Lots of people would act differently if they knew what they know today, but we can't see the future so all we can do is learn from the past and make the best decision you can today.

Just giving you tips man.
I know experienced traders that consistently made profitable margin trades only to get called by one or two very unlucky trades in crypto. 
It's not easy when 10-20% fluctuations is considered normal.

Dogecoin. Up 117% just last week

That's not why people use hardware wallets. With hardware wallets you'll have your coins if gdax is down for maintenance, you'll have your coins if they get hacked, you'll have your coins even if they decide to freeze your account. 
Dodging tax is stupid with or without a ledger. But with a hardware wallet your coins are under your control.

Good plan, me too

If you're asking reddit to help you decide on your position then you shouldn't have access to margin.

Considering all btc sells before the massive rise this year is a "loss", a single coin could be considered a "loss" by every single previous owner. 
So in the end the statistic, even assuming every single one is valid, is largely meaningless.

2FA everything.

Good thing I took a large chunk of my coins out earlier this week.

Ahh, the days when I had 10btc... Only if I had hodl
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:20:56
Econ teacher back in highschool mentioned it in senior class around 2011. Forgot it until after the 2013 crash and got in (didn't hodl) :/

Think from his perspective. If he gives in now, he makes less money now. If he hold for as long as he can, then he makes more money now and make less when he can't hold any longer. 
Since he'll make the same once he gives in, it's logical for him to hold as long as he can.

Blockchain gets hacked. This is less likely than the banks getting hacked so don't worry.
Exchange gets hacked. Happened before and can happen again. Using a desktop/paper wallet can prevent losing too much if it happens.
You getting hacked. This is the most likely but also the most preventable. Don't go flaunting how much you have irl and enable 2fa on exchanges.

No single person controls the price. That's the inherent risk with investing in crypto currencies. 
You said you've been watching the prices for a while, did you research the basics of investing?
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:37:53
Nobody's stopping you from converting all your bitcoin to litecoin or eth.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:19:46
What the fuck are you talking about? They're just trying scrape some extra money before giving in. They don't reaaally have their "honor" involved.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:25:26
The only way btc can lose all of its value is if the blockchain gets completely cracked (not just on one computer, but the whole network...at the same time). 
Bitcoin is specifically designed to protect against this type of attacks. And the hacker don't have any incentive to do this. So not likely at all.

Where so I apply to be a shill? I'd love to get paid for shit posting on reddit
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:02:08
There's always people advocating for both buying and selling at all times. Follow what you think is right. If you're panicking this hard then you should've done more research before going in. 
The fact of the matter is nobody really knows what's going to happen. If I were you I'd hold on to the bitcoins unless you need that 6000 to survive (then again you shouldn't have invested)
