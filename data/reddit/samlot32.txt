Serious question. What makes us think that lightning network adoption would be quick? If segwit is any measure, lightning rollout will take forever.

FUCK YAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

So if one exchange can clog the bitcoin network than shame on the network. Robust systems need to be idiot proofed.

What is this the fucking gustapo?  fuck you. I'll use my bitcoin how I want.

Can’t wait till coinbase implements Segwit and batching and the fees are still high. Red herring right hurr.

Bitcoin was put on the map due to merchant adoption and that is slowly being eaten away. Newegg just dropped bitcoin acceptance. While smaller blocks are ideally better we have to be pragmatic at this point in keeping bitcoin useable as a currency - because that is how the world sees it, and the moment normies come and see high fees they will run away. 
I was hooked the moment I sent my first transaction for practically nothing. New users don’t get that experience now unfortunately.

I used to think coinbase dragged their feet on purpose, but after the bch debacle, I think they’re just incompetent.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:01:25
I own bcash as a hedge against core incompetence. Look at my post history, I’ve trolled btc with shitcoin posts in the past because that’s what it is.

OR we can get, you know, a block size increase until layer 2 solutions are ready? Once L2 solution is ready, reduce blocksize.
I know. Difficult.

Your either a troll or don’t understand engrish. I think the latter.

Other coins have perfectly executed hardforks in the past (e.g., monero, eth). I’m not sure why we your using this self-paralyzing argument.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:41:42
Where did I say they were incompetent? I bought bch as an insurance policy against them because at this rate, no merchant will be accepting bitcoin within 6 months. Lots of hypersensitive four year olds in this thread.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:48:49
This is what scares me about the crypto market. Lack of understanding about...lots of things.
Pro tip: you can buy into etfs or mutual funds that track the Dow Jones.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:41:55
I'm pretty neutral in the debate, but the moves tend to go opposite the herd. BTG was expected to be 0 but is now 350 lol. BCH, once listed on coinbase, will moon imo. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:49:23
Reddit is not the crypto universe and even within reddit not everyone fits or wants to be apart of the tribal wars. I'm here to make $$, idgaf if it's through layer 2, on chain, or through the use of a flux capacitor.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:47:56
Because they've already hinted at adding other coins to GDAX and also for purchase, and also because they've been working on at least BCH token withdrawals for the last few months, I don't think it's too farfetched to think they wouldn't add it for trading and purchase.  I'm sure someone in Coinbase is licking their chops over the amount of exchange fees they can get from the 3rd largest crypto in the market. Money talks. I would call this educational speculation lol.

“Not a great strategy for any investment” were your exact words meaning the DCA strategy is not great for long term investments. I’m not saying bitcoin is a retirement product more or less pouting out that your statement is inaccurate.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:48:04
Uh? What? Nothing wrong with a DCA strategy for long term plans like retirements

Bitcoin isn't anonymous.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:05:20
Yes, big one. The 2X fork goes through and your balance is 0. 
Real possibility (though not likely in my non expert opinion) considering a lot of exchanges are treating the chain with the biggest hash as as btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:35:44
You mean mint blockchange?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:25:52
Agreed. I just hope he confusion causes a temp sell off that I can increase my position in.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:24:18
There's too much uncertainty to say for sure. My plan is to just hold both as this is a game of survivor; only one chain will remain. There may be a point where it's clear which chain will survive and if the other chain still has some value, I'll sell them.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:39:19
TLDR: no idea. I’m not reading that monstrous wall of text.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:19:48
Only reason I am pro 2x is because of the chance of a nice correction to get some cheap coin lol. Still dca'ing every week either way. Have some fiat on hand for a large purchase, however.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:10:38
There is a slight risk, imo, that the hash rate fluctuating causes mass confusion and the price corrects till we get clarity. Imagine if coinbase calls 2x the real btc while another exchange calls the original chain the real btc. That moment of colossal confusion will be interesting.
