Agreed. Yes you can buy $10 worth of bitcoin.  Also consider fees for all interactions with the bitcoin network, with fees being charged on buying and sending bitcoin.

I think the op is pointing to article’s title as a claim of importance for obtaining the other 97% not in crypto at the moment. 
You’re right to say I already use another wallet and this doesn’t affect me really.

We need people like you who won’t be sold. We need people who won’t buy today (because it’s not what they want to define as valuable) only to eat their own words and buy later when it’s inevitably higher in price.

There’s wallets where you can pay like 1 satoshi (like blue wallet). I also prefer samurai wallet. I’ll pay the extra 0.005 usd, it’s worth me paying the miners.

1. Trust Wallet's telegram has people watching for susceptible  victims. They will direct message you and ask for your seed phrase.
2. Mycelium for iOS hasn't been updated in over a year.
3. Attempting to restore a BTC wallet created in the Trust Wallet app via the seed phrase will not work for iOS version of Mycelium.
4. Attempting to restore a BTC wallet created in the iOS version of Mycelium app via the seed phrase will not work for Trust.
5. Attempting to restore a BTC wallet created in either iOS version of Mycelium app or Trust Wallet app via the seed phrase will work in Blue Wallet app.
6. Wallet restored from seed phrase for BTC wallet created in Mycelium properly imported into Blue Wallet app.
7. Wallet restored from seed phrase for BTC wallet created in Trust Wallet app generated a different BTC address in the Blue Wallet app than that which was originally created in the Trust Wallet.
8. I sent BTC to this new address to make sure, and no coins showed up in Trust Wallet but were visible in Blue Wallet.
9. This is still Too Long to Read, negating the point of TLDR.
10. Still can't restore the Mycelium created BTC wallet into Trust Wallet via seed phrase.
This has got to be more of a headache than anything else I've experienced so far when it comes to crypto, but probably because I'm only now paying attention after the whole Proof of Keys announcement.

# If you have an iPhone, please take note!
Mycelium app for iOS hasn't received updates for over a year!
All this confusion is due to Mycelium dropping iOS development! I'm taking active steps to review and rate this app and request it's removal from the iOS Appstore.

I hope Tulsi Gabbard isn't as salty as some of my friends. Article mentioned she bought ETH in Dec 2017, $1k-$15k worth. Think she's even familiar with the term HODL? I wonder if she's pro-Bitcoin or if she's like my friends and she thinks it's dumb because she now has an exchange account full of worthless altcoins.

Ok so the Mycelium Wallet generates a BIP44 P2PKH address, and Trust Wallet's multi-coin wallet does actually generate a BTC seed, but it's a BIP49 P2SH address.
This is why I wasn't able to import the seed from one wallet into the other, however I was able to import both seed phrases into Blue Wallet to determine the issue. Upon further research, I learned that the leading **1** or **3** of the public address also can be used to determine if P2PKH or P2SH.
Either way, I'm now 100% sold on using the Trust Wallet as my only wallet for BTC and ETH. Just waiting on XMR.

They claim this is not an admin but a fake account. Maybe someone will find this useful during the Proof of Keys event. 
Can anyone confirm that the Trust Wallet allows to restore a BTC wallet from a seed phrase. So far I've determined that the BTC wallet in the app is just for a "multi-coin" wallet, and the seed phrase from the wallet created in the Trust Wallet app doesn't restore the BTC Wallet in the Mycelium wallet app.
At this point, I'm just going to stick with Mycelium until proven otherwise.

Most wallet software provides a function to add another wallet and be able to switch back and forth between.
Create a new address, backup private keys (avoiding previous issues), and send the BTC from you’re old wallet to the new one.

I ran into an issue. I restored a BTC wallet address in Blue Wallet using the multi-coin wallet seed phrase from Trust Wallet, and it gave me a different BTC address.
I think I've spent too much time trying to *understand* if I truly have access to my BTC private keys in the Trust Wallet since it's listed as Multi-Coin Wallet, and I'm not able to restore the wallet in other applications (in the event that Trust Wallet were to disappear in the future).
I still like Trust Wallet for Ethereum, and I will keep checking for when I can import my BTC seed phrase from Mycelium.
