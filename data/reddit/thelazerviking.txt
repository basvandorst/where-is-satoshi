Just do what you can in proportion to your stash.  Many people very close to you may be struggling.  Keep your eyes open for opportunities to help like Gofundme.

I actually checked just now and the money is already in my bank account. &lt;shrug&gt;

The same exact thing happened to me.  They took the money out on the 17th and the bitcoins were supposed to be in by last night.  But, when I checked last night the transaction was gone.  I clicked on the purchase details of another transaction then clicked "history".  It showed that the transaction was canceled yesterday.  I just figured I must have fat fingered the cancel button on accident when I was looking to see if the bitcoins came through or not.

Please do your due diligence before buying from Provident Metals.  I almost bought from them because their prices are so low.  But after reading all the terrible reviews, I'm glad I steered clear.

We want to end the Fed, not by petitioning the state or by violent means, but by making it obsolete by encouraging people to voluntarily choose alternatives to the dollar like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as their medium of exchange.
The title is also a nod to Ron Paul for first awakening us to the corrupt nature of the Federal Reserve system.  This is what made us want to actively search out alternatives like precious metals.  But, knowing the limitations of sending precious metals in a ever more digital world, we were always looking for something better. Once we were introduced to Bitcoin on an Adam vs the Man episode(shout out to Adam Kokesh!) in early 2013 during the Cyprus debt crisis, we knew right away the implications of such a technology, and were immediately hooked and have been Bitcoiners ever since.
We are a two-piece rock band from Austin, TX and we have been playing this song in our live set since early 2015 and recorded the song later that year.  This year we got in touch with Zenith Quinn aka redditor “gapmunky" because we saw that he was accepting Bitcoin for his badass animations.  After lots of work, and several drafts later, this is our piece de resistance and we really hope you enjoy it!
If you have any animation projects that you need done, we highly recommend Zenith Quinn.  He was extremely professional and didn’t stop until we were 100% satisfied with the animation.  We paid for the work in Bitcoin and everything went incredibly smooth.
We encourage everyone to go download the song for FREE at our bandcamp page. We also have two other albums you can check out as well.

We will be putting up our new e.p. in the next couple weeks, which will consist of 5 previously unreleased songs that we recorded in the same recording session as “End The Fed”.  You are really going to dig these new tunes, so don’t forget to hit the like button to stay updated on that.
Thank you!
