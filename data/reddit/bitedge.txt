* Global and unrestricted, all players are welcome no matter where they are.
* Free and instant deposits and withdraws of any amount 24/7
* The betting operators save so much money in transaction processing, chargebacks know your customer and anti money laundering that they can give higher payouts
* Betting anonymously makes it 
 - impossible for a sportsbook to limit you for winning too often
 - impossible to miss for the operator to misuse, sell or have stolen your details and credit card information
 - easier to avoid legal restrictions and tax burdens

That is not the choice that the man on the street sees presented to him. People consider practical things that affect them directly not the trade off between the potential to partly fund a bailout Vs guardrails and insurance.
The choice is do I want to have to fill out a special form to send more than $10,000? do I want to wait 5 days for an international bank transfer? do I want my paypal suspended every time I log in when traveling abroad? 
So why isn't the man on the street using bitcoin for all these things? Because people already have an existing relationship with their banks and its hard to get your first bitcoin. So the potential future convenience considerations are mitigated by short term convenience consideration.

For bitcoin to take 50% of the gambling industry it needs to be easy to use offline which is a long way off.  


To get to 5% we will pass through 0.5% and 2.5% et cetera, the unknown is in what timeframe.

**Paywall buster**
Is it an attempt to protect the country's big state-owned banks from competition, or is it indeed a genuine effort to crack down on fraud? The latest move by the Chinese central bank to cap the amount of money that Chinese consumers can send through online sites has left commentators sharply divided.
In any case, the new guidelines released by the People's Bank of China on Friday are a big setback for the two big firms that dominate China's online payment system: Alipay, an offshoot of the ecommerce giant Alibaba, which controls almost 50 per cent of all Chinese online payments; and TenPay, the payment arm of the social media and gaming group Tencent, which controls about 20 per cent of the market.
These two big online payment groups are threatening to invade the traditional domain of China's big banks. Not only do they allow the payment of online purchases, but users can also use them to pay bills or settle the cost of a taxi ride. What's more, they can be used to make funds transfers within seconds, as well as offering financial investments.
Online payments are expected to hit ¥11.8 trillion yuan ($2.6 trillion) this year, up from ¥8.1 trillion last year, says Chinese internet market research firm iResearch.
The Chinese central bank's proposal, which will be adopted after a consultation period with industry, says Chinese citizens will be limited to making payments of ¥1000 a day on payment sites that require only one source of identification, and up to ¥5000 a day on sites that require at least two proofs of identity. Larger payments must be done through the payer's account at a commercial bank.
Faced with opposition to its latest proposal to cap payments, the Chinese central bank took the highly unusual step of issuing a follow-up statement on the weekend that responded to the criticism.
The PBOC quoted figures showing that last year, 71 per cent of online payment platform users made payments totalling less than ¥1000, to support its claim that most users will be unaffected by the new cap.
The central bank also emphasised that its new rules were aimed at improving the security of internet payments.
'A HOLISTIC CONSIDERATION OF PAYMENT EFFICIENCY'
"Transfer limits are proposed based on a holistic consideration of payment efficiency and convenience, as well as factors such as anti-money laundering and client fund security," the bank said.
But although some believe that the PBOC's latest move is an attempt to introduce some order into the unregulated and chaotic world of internet finance, others see it as an effort to protect China's big state-owned banks.
They say Alibaba and Tencent are not only engaged in a fierce competition with each other, they're also facing resistance from the big Chinese banks, which for the most part have failed to come up with the innovative, easy-to-use interfaces offered by China's two internet champions.
Even worse for the Chinese banks, these internet players are threatening to move further into their core activities.
Alibaba has already launched an online money market fund, Yu'E Bao, which offers attractive returns to Chinese savers. And after receiving a banking licence in June, Alibaba's finance affiliate launched a new online lender, MYBank, which will make loans of up to ¥5 million to private individuals and small firms. This follows Tencent's creation of WeBank, which began offering a commercial banking service in April. Both new operations are looking to take a slice of the estimated ¥23 trillion household loans market that is growing fast as more Chinese borrowers look for credit.
This move shouldn't worry Chinese bankers in the short term – Chinese banks filled the four top spots for profits across the global industry last year, earning almost double the amount of their US rivals. But they are worried that they could be missing out on a shift that is about to transform their business.
Fortunately for them as they battle to stave off growing competition from the country's internet giants, they have the ear of China's banking regulator, which is concerned about the growing risks in China's financial system.

I thought the post was a joke because miners always get 25 BTC for minning every block. If you actually want to pledge a separate reward I suggest you change the amount. 
I am not sure about technical feasibility but if it was possible a cool way to do this would be to make a transaction 1.1 MB in size with a  30 BTC miners fee. Only a big block miner could get it and they could see that they definitely will get it, not  just your word.
Or perhaps it could be done as a smart contract with an oracle watching the blockchain.

Yes although only in a small way that is more than made up for by doing the other things. The things is by voting at all you are endorsing the idea that a small class of individuals should rule over all of us, demand whatever taxes they want, limit our freedom however they want et cetera. I think that very idea is wrong. 
If there ever was a vote that honestly would make a difference, like if Patrick burn was running with a credible platform to end the fed against Donald Trump who had a credible platform to invade Iran. I think the reality of making a real change for the better would outway the above.

The financial system in the country you live in is the same as in Greece and Puerto Rico, they are just further along the inevitable path to default and devaluing or confiscating the people's money which will be the end result of your government currency as well. The Debt can never be paid off because all new money is new debt.

Here is the presentation at the conference
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:34:12
**TL;DR**   
Bitcoin Rush took my bitcoins from my account because they did not like the [review]( I posted about them (the review was more positive at the time than it is now). 
I am James Canning, I run [Bitedge]( which used to be called the Bitcoin Betting Guide. 
[Here]( is me giving a presentation at my local meetup (go to 4:19)    
[Here]( is me in the bitcoin doco (go to 22:22)    
[Here]( is me interviewed for Bitcoin the end of money as we know it. 
I am posting this because I care about the bitcoin gambling ecosystem and I am sick of amateurish operators acting dishonestly.
**What happened**   
After [some disagreement]( about our Bitcoin Rush review and inclusions on my site I was surprised to receive the following in an email from Bitcoin Rush.


I thought it was petty and a bad business decision but if that was all then I would not be making this post, it’s their affiliate program after all. However it was much worse than that.
Bitcoin Rush took my cleared funds out of my account! The previous day I could bet with those funds or withdraw them just like any user who has deposited their own bitcoins or had affiliate payments in their account. Then my bitcoins were simply gone from my account.
I was surprised because I had always defended Bitcoin Rush as being an honest and reliable operator, I did not think they were as high quality as the best bitcoin sportsbooks but I did say in the review that users funds were safe with them. Now we know they are not.
I sought clarification and to get my funds back multiple times and was told I had gone against the affiliate terms and conditions without any specifics of what I had done that was against what term or condition. I could not see anything in those vague terms and conditions I had gone against so I asked again and was told.


So there it is, Bitcoin Rush stole my bitcoins from my account because they don't like what I said about them. I never called Bitcoin Rush one of the worst sites around, that is them exaggerating, and even if I had have done so that would not be against the terms and conditions. Even if I had have gone against the terms and condition nowhere do they say that gives Bitcoin Rush the right to take the cleared funds from previous deposits or affiliate payments out of my account.
As such Bitcoin Rush should no longer be trusted by the bitcoin community, [provably fair]( does not help much if they steal your bitcoin for reasons they make up as they go along. Luckily there is no reason to risk it as there are far higher quality, more professional and more trustworthy bitcoin sportsbooks and casinos [reviewed on Bitedge](
For those interested here is the full backstory of the disagreements leading up to the theft.
After I posted about this here and on [Bitcoin Talk Forum]( BitcoinRush defended their action and refused to pay me back.
They dishonestly labelled me as hostile, threatening, unreasonable, slanderous, childish, petty and immature. Most of what they said publicly was deliberately misleading, they understated the amount, they said it was after I stopped linking to them, they said I was an affiliate and not a player, all untrue.
After they saw most community members disagreed with them they edited some of the above mentioned comments and paid me the amount owing. So I do owe thanks to the bitcoin community for pressuring BitcoinRush to do the right thing which they otherwise would not have done.
Good luck and have fun bitcoining!

I write up in full why bitcoin volotility is not a problem for gambling here
Bitcoin volatility is not an issue for 
1. The vast majority of bitcoiners who believe in the currency and accept the short term fluctuations. 
2. Recreational gamblers who are doing it for fun.
3. Anyone who thinks bitcoin is likely to go up in the short term.
This only leaves a very small subset.

No, we can be sure they won't as I and other people I know have successfully withdrawn double figure bitcoin amounts from them multiple times anonymously. This experiance is part of the value of [Bitedge](


People want to gamble online, in the US that is almost always illegal. The laws are the problem (restricting freedom for religion based morality) not the act of going against them. Their are good operators and bad. 


No it isn't, I do constantly get contacted by less trustworthy sites offering money to be included on [Bitedge]( and they do not get on there.

For real change don’t fight the system, ignore and bypass the system. Powerful ways to do that are
* Don’t vote, a vote for anyone gives legitimacy and support to the system and to whoever wins even if you vote against them
* Minimise the tax you pay, taxes empower the state and fund the war machine
* Don’t use banks or governmental currency, the answer here is bitcoin. Preferring bitcoins to the government’s currency undermines their power in the most fundamental and all-encompassing way, it damages their ability to print and borrow wealth and fund all the things they want to do that you don’t want them to do.

The current methods to transfer domain ownership require one party to put himself in a position where the other party could rip him off or the use of a slow, expensive, fallible and corruptible middleman (escrow).
The bitcoin solution is an open source smart contract with an oracle that receives the buyers bitcoin then monitors the domain’s whois information for the change of ownership then transfers the bitcoins to the seller.
This requires no change to any laws, no change to the ICANN domain name registration system and no change at the domain registrars. We can do this today!

No news on the Winks etf is very bad news for it. The longer it goes unapproved the less likely it is to ever be approved. 
Many mistakenly think the Winks are Wall street insiders, they simply arent, they are almost nobodies, they certainly dont have the clout needed to influence regulators. 
I assume the regulators needed to approve the ETF have been told by their real bosses (one of the big banks or similar) not to approve this so that an actual wall street insider can do it first.

Well that is an interesting issue. When I started writing about bitcoin gambling in 2013 most operators were unlicenced and did not require any identifying information. 
They still don't require any identifying information but many now have flag of convenience licenses which is where the change to the T&amp;Cs has come in. 
Still I have never heard of any of the quality sportsbooks that I recommend request a user's identity. Some ask for an email address but you can get around it. 
Probably the most anonymous is [Nitrogen Sports]( ([review]( as they do not even ask for an email. I still maintain that bitcoin gambling can be anonymous.

@_date: 2015-07-05 22:00:29
There are no specific laws relating to gambling with bitcoin. As such we assume that gambling with bitcoins falls in the same legal category as gambling with government currency. If online gambling with your local currency is legal where you are then online gambling with bitcoins is also legal where you are. If online gambling is illegal where you are gambling with bitcoins has the benefit of being anonymous. The laws and legal systems exist to serve the state and no one else, there is no moral obligation to comply and I recommend you mostly ignore them as they are a hindrance.

Well after the confirmation link in the email is clicked it takes a week for the transfer to complete to in that sense no one is doing anything quickly.

Reasonable in what matter? Giving Bitcoin Rush the review you want rather that the review I felt was accurate.


Lie, I stopped linking to BitcoinRush about 20 minutes before I posted this.

Generally the register found in whois info is the upstream whole sale register that the owner never actually deals with. For example I have a domain registered and namecheap but the whois lists whatever whole sale provider namecheap use rather then listing namecheap.

The short answer is no.
The longer answer is it depends if this was part of a business, I assume not so no.
The full length answer is here

Not with .com, or any extension average joe can access in his browser. 
But for sure the things that have and have not worked well on the namecoin system would be a great case study for anyone making a system like the one I propose to study and learn from.

I just had an idea about using bitcoin escrow to trustlessly transfer domain name ownership. The idea uses smart contract + oracle but multisig could also be part of a solution, details here.

legal in the US for people in the US? impossible, and people in the US are the majority of this sub. 
Licencing situation is pretty much the same as at government currecy sportsbooks
They have a licence to offer their product globally from their licensing jurisdiction but other governments (like the US) may not recognise those licences in their jurisdiction. 
Yes its all a big fuckup based on greed for taxation and religious morality, I encourage you to break these laws

Indeed. I left my old job to work full time in bitcoin and I feel like the no-change/small block crowd are attacking my livelihood and my dreams.

By a small group of lawyers and politicians yes, by the general public no. At that point things wouls start to unravel and fall apart.

So I guess their big picture must be for this device to get enough traction that PC manufacturers start integrating it into their computers. As in this HP laptop has graphics by NVIDIA sound by DOLBY and Bitcoin by 21.

Thanks so much if you can help :)

You're right that what is needed can be bought but only over a long period of time. Legal advice is not needed, having long lasting mutually lucrative relationship with decision makers in power is needed.

The 6 best bitcoin sportsbook all have odds on it that can be compared side by side here
 
So you get the best possible pay out. You're right that overall winner is hard to find but you're better off betting on individual games anyway Good luck.

A lot of people mistakenly think the Winks are Wall Street insiders. They simply aren't. Getting approval for a bitcoin ETF would require major insider clout. 
I have no hope for this particular ETF. It's just a matter of time until someone does it but it might be 5 years andI doubt it will be a couple of C list celebrities.

That's actually amazing there are so many small and medium scale uses for this like keeping track of contributions to group projects or allowing and recording access to restricted things.
The fact that there is a very small fee for sending these monetarily worthless tokens can actually work well in some of those use cases. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:12:24


You could transfer it to a different account which is the equivalent of withdrawing.
Yes this assumes the absence of capital controls but so does the idea of withdrawing cash.

There are 2 good options, [Nitrogen]( and [Betcoin]( reviewed here.
For torments Betcoin is better. They are not shady they are just not that good at managing their operation. Nitrogen is a better operator. Run good!

And if x% of transactions through the channel are disputed (as they always are with bitcoin) they will shut it down.

I gather the 12 is assuming one needs to get a 7 12 times in a row. The amount of consecutive 7s required changes from 12 to 13, I am not sure what Nitrogen are doing with that or if other numbers are possible.

ah cool, so make whatever bet you like with someone else who has the app but it's up to the loser to pay the winner out? So you should only bet small amounts with trusted friends? Hence the term social betting.

These are less than 0.1 % of sports bettors, they do not rate a mention but since you do wait until we can offer Trustless no account 0% house edge sports betting as per
TLDR the "sportsbook is softwear paying out 100% of bets.
