All major currencies are speculated on daily...

Sounds like a problem with existing financial institutions, not bitcoin.

I think the general idea is that localbitcoins can be priced more speculatively because they feel less constrained by exchanges, since they essentially ARE the exchange in this case.

I can buy an iPhone 5 (?) now, or I can wait and buy an iPhone 10 in 5 years. But amazingly enough, people still buy the iPhone 5.

Have you read his posts? The guy is clearly not right in the head, he is perfectly fine with allowing his sister to accrue debt when she has NO idea what is going on because he LIED to her. This is much more than a mistake or two, it is indicative of a gambling problem.

For sure. I'll leave this in writing so I can go back and laugh at myself later, but I do predict BTC to reach $1300 within the next two weeks. After that... I'm not too sure.

In the specific case of Just-Dice, what variables can you control or watch in order to turn a profit? I count cards professionally and I am intrigued by the notion that you have in fact found a system that beats a dice game.

Has anyone gotten their tip yet?

Does anyone have a quick tutorial on how to use the tip bot? My aunt adopted a cat from here once and I would love to give back.

So you don't have a system, you just rely luck to push you over the house edge? That's not really a strategy, that's gambling.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:27:55
Yes, you are correct with regards to Risk of Ruin increasing with bet size. I'm not sure why you think I don't understand that - after all you're the one getting upset that I am using "theories" instead of "real world" results (even though real world results are merely the reflection of a theory). You realize, of course, that you are still employing a fundamentally flawed mindset if you believe a strategy with less than 50% chance of winning is fundamentally sound.
Now, if you are going into it with the mindset of "There is a tiny tiny chance I could lose it all, and the parameters of the game favor the house  long-term, and I accept that," well, that's fine, but it's gambling (because your strategy is inherently unsuccessful long term). Whereas I (and casinos) can say "There is a tiny tiny chance we lose all our money - but it is worth the risk, because we have the security of odds in our favor." Yes, casinos have a better shot at staying in business than I do. Bankrolling is a huge issue among counters for that very reason. You are making tangentially connected points that don't address the question I am asking you. Obviously having an edge doesn't eliminate Risk of Ruin, but it does help to have odds in your favor, I'm sure we can all agree on that as a basic mathematical concept.
My blackjack strategies are built with the inclusion of bankroll limitations and variance. I can do that because I have knowledge that *in general*, I will be winning 51% of the time. I can further increase my profits by varying my bets with the count. Do you understand that the basic principle behind this strategy is the knowledge that long-term, I am statistically likely to come out ahead? 
You are taking a gamble with your strategy. It is a well calculated gamble with minimal chance of loss, true. However, it is not a gamble that can be repeated with success long-term, and I would not classify it as anything other than slowing down your loss rate.
Let me ask you - do you have a bankroll large enough to run your betting system to its limit? Or are you left with real-world limitations, just like card counters? The difference between you and card counters is that a card counting system can be applied to a limited bankroll and still remain generally profitable. Your system relies on luck to push it in to profit. A true professional does not rely on luck.
And before you talk about variances etc., please understand I have been doing this professionally for quite a while. I have established a consulting business for advantage players and I have played all over the world. I have been down $70k in one night and I have made over $200k in a single session. I understand profit fluctuation better than most, and the thing that keeps me sane is the knowledge that I employ a winning system. Can you say the same?

I got mine promptly. Thank you :)

But the odds aren't in your favor. When I count well, I am playing at a 0.5-1.5% advantage over the casino. You, however, are still playing at an overall disadvantage, regardless of your approach. If we ran my card counting system 34 billion times, I will come out ahead. If we run your strategy 34 billion times, we will come out behind. That's the point I am trying to make.
You are operating a system in which you are inherently at a disadvantage. You're only fooling yourself if you believe that the Martingdale (or any other betting strategy) is a consistent winning formula. It may have performed in that manner in the past for you, and hell, you may have great success with it for the rest of your life. Just remember that numbers are numbers - I only play games where I'm supposed to come out ahead ;)

Not to rag on you but with the price at $1088.04 currently (four days after you posted), this comment is funny. Just goes to show how unpredictable day trading is.

You haven't shown me any method by which you push your long-term chances of winning to positive. Using a method in which your chances of profiting are less than 50% is gambling, period. If you find yourself using the phrase "as long as [statistically unlikely event] doesn't happen, my method works," you don't actually have a solid strategy. You are employing the same flawed logic as a Powerball player.
You are correct, I can be expected to win in blackjack and still experience losses. This is actually a topic that I have addressed before on the terms of bankroll, i.e. if I play a $25 minimum with a fairly aggressive betting strategy, I will need a $12,500 bankroll to ensure a 99% chance that I do not bust during profit fluctuations - but there is still a 1% it could happen. I accept that rate because I know that the odds are in my favor and by playing more games, I am likely to eliminate short-term noise and enter the long-term.
You seem to have an issue with using "in theory." May I suggest to you this simple statement: All gambling models are based on theories, because otherwise we would forever play games over and over, never learning from our results. You cannot convince me that playing a game with 49.5% odds is somehow a good strategy - it may be good for YOU, but that does not mean the theory is sound or worth pursuing. If you think in the proper long-term mindset (which you should if you are serious about gambling), that means that every time you place a $100 bet with 49.5% chance of winning, you have cost yourself 50 cents, regardless of the short-term outcome.
Everything I am saying is pretty generally accepted amongst professional advantage players. Everything I have seen you write (unless you can throw me some math showing that you have in fact increased your odds to beat the house long-term) is simply post-hoc justification for a bad gambling strategy. 
**If your gambling strategy still leaves the house with an edge, it is not a strategy.**
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:06:07
What are you talking about? I even said I don't have a 0% Risk of Ruin a little later in my post, haha. Casino's don't employ a strategy similar to that - they have a winning strategy that can easily handle outliers because the odds are overwhelmingly in their favor.
I guess I'll ask again. Can you show me any way in which your gambling strategy gives you 50% or greater odds? Because otherwise there is really no discussion worth having here.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:32:38
Looks great. Sent you a PM.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:44:24
Right, so in every case, the house has a long-term advantage. This means that any "strategies" applied to this gaming model are, at best, methods of losing money less quickly.
