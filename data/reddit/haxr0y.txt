wat? Typical buttcoiner persecution complex on display for posterity. I didn't even mention bitcoin, I simply scoffed at the notion that internet is more essential than clean water.


And the consequences of that are millions dead every year from diarrhoeal diseases. Are you so drunk on crypto-koolaid that you're actually hallucinating a reality where a world without mpesa is even comparable to a world without clean drinking water?
If buttcoiners were sane, the response would have been something like "well of course clean water is an essential human need, we're not saying that internet access is even comparable to that, however buttcoin has the potential to..." then follow with something about remittances and some hand waiving regarding the fact that actually cashing or spending buttcoins in the developing world is a pain in the ass - whatever, the point is that internet access is clearly less important than basic human needs like clean water, and only a staggeringly ignorant and delusional buttcoiner could rationalize their way into believing otherwise.

Rome funded its campaigns with increasingly debased currency because Rome's currency was increasingly debased, gradually, over hundreds of years. It's a pretty narrow view of history to suggest that Rome debased its currency primarily to fund wars. Once again, a state, particularly *an empire*, doesn't need to debase its currency in order to wage war, its monopoly on the means of production during war-time is sufficient for that cause.

Yeah, except apples and computers are clearly different.

"The current state of bank centralization" is what exists now and for the foreseeable future. Even if bitcoin goes mainstream, it does not preclude the use of centralized banks. My OP stated "you need a better bank" not "you need to use bitcoin" because bitcoin doesn't solve any problems in this situation since the recipient needs to 
A. Have a bank.
B. Pass bitcoin KYC checks.
C. Wait 1-5 days to have the funds deposited as usable currency into their account.
With the "get a better bank" approach, steps B and C are unnecessary. 


Where did you argue that bank centralization is a bad thing? You seemed to imply that a banking *monopoly* (something totally different) is a bad thing, but I don't see what that has to do with anything since nobody is in favor of a banking monopoly and a banking monopoly does not exist in the developed world which is abound with big banks, small banks and plenty of credit unions in between. Of course, there aren't as many choices in the banking world compared to the bitcoin world, but that is *by design* since rigorous oversight is the difference between the reviled BofA and the reviled MtGOX
With that in mind, it seems to me that bitcoin payment gateways are way more centralized than fiat banks, but nobody seems to mind that if coinbase or bitpay get hit by a DDOS then the entire bitcoin economy will slump into stasis while they try to bring their systems back online.

Nobody is arguing against that. It's like stating that $200.00 Nikes are more achievable for inner city kids than affordable healthcare...

I can see why it makes sense to accept bitcoin-to-fiat as payment through a centralized bitpay-style approach, I don't see why any company where bitcoin doesn't relate to the core business model would be incentivized to hold bitcoin.  What are the advantages? 
The disadvantages I see:
* Regulatory grey areas are always scary to businesses.
* It costs money to deal with the technical issues related to securely storing, auditing and keeping the books on bitcoin.
*  Even once secured, bitcoins still run a small but real risk of being irreversibly stolen which is not a risk with fiat.
* It is risky for a business to store any significant amount of money as bitcoin because of volatility and the potential for a big crash.
* Large or emergency liquidation of bitcoins could prove problematic depending on the amount of funds.
* It will likely be undesirable to have the blockchain maintain a public record of any substantial financial activities (especially wrt paying suppliers, employees or entities you may not want to publicly link to your business)
Please let me know if I'm missing something.

Dumb idea. Bits already have a clearly established definition in the context of computer systems, that's the whole reason bitcoins are called bitcoins; money (coins) that are stored, transferred, and represented digitally (bits). Calling bitcoins 'bits' is akin to referring to screwdrivers as 'screws', it makes no sense, you're simply cutting off half the meaning of the word.

Nothing is objectively good or evil. First of all, "good" and "evil" are clearly human defined labels that have no absolute meaning. Rape and murder regularly occur in nature, but these acts do not qualify as evil even though non-human animals physically suffer just as humans do from these acts. Moral labels evolve to match society's values. In many places in the world, blasphemy is considered so immoral that it is punishable by death, yet many of us would consider that a ridiculous judgement. 
Further, in certain societies that we might consider less enlightened, acts such as rape are not always considered immoral depending on the circumstances, your instinct might be to simply label this as an evil society, but that doesn't change the fact that there is no objective truth  we can highlight to demonstrate that *your* form of morality is the valid one.

It's a strawman because nowhere am I suggesting anyone use any particular type of bank, my point is no way related to that, my point is that "the small handful of banks" are the banks that most people use, hence: 


is not a meaningful criticism because in practice, most people that have a bank account **will** be eligible for this type of transfer. 


It's not a strawman because it's not an argument, it was just a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the fact that your facetious "transfers will be instant" remark appears to take for granted that bitcoin can only achieve secure instant transfers through bank-like centralization.

Nice moving the goal post, now that you've been presented with evidence and citations, you backtrack into "WELL THAT WAS SO LONG AGO AND OUT OF CONTEXT". Not a good look. Now let's see what type of evidence *you* provide.


Here, we're talking about a specific individual (Neil Cavuto), you asked why he was called terrible, a plethora of evidence was provided for you to consume regarding this INDIVIDUAL, and you respond with vague bullshit about a nebulous group called "left wing commentators and politicians" which could include thousands of individuals. Yeah, I bet some of them lied, what's your point? We're talking about Cavuto. Notice how you had to take an entire category of "left wingers" to compare with ONE fox news idiot. 


Wrong again. Obama sucks, let's just get that outta the way. Why are we even talking about Obama again? You've moved the goalpost so far that you have to reach for Obama failures to bolster your defense of FOX NEWS. LOL. Why don't you defend your beloved Neil Cavuto since that is the topic of discussion. Start with some evidence.

I just don't see it happening. Nobody has an incentive to use bitcoin as money. 
Obviously the hodlers don't have any incentive to spend it and the masses similarly have no incentive to convert their fiat into bitcoin in order to spend the bitcoin. 
Bitcoin really only seems to make sense as a store of value since deflation will continue to encourage enthusiasts to hodl and bitcoin will always be more difficult to use for day to day purchases than fiat money. In a future where bitcoin is stable and more secure, it seems like it'd be an ideal way to store wealth independently, but realistically, I just don't see a way to make bitcoin viable as money.

Yeah, seems like this is something that isn't available at all banks, I could imagine a scenario where bitcoin works out a bit better, but it seems similarly fraught with difficulties since the receiving party needs a bank account *and* to deal with the bitcoin broker's KYC process (if they can pass it, which is not always possible)

Man you guys are dense.


Notice how you had to append that strawman qualifier to your sentence in order for it to make sense. *Obviously* if you have communal access to water, plumbing and electricity then *those basic needs are being met*.  I didn't think I had to explain that *access to basic needs* precludes *not meeting your basic needs*. Jesus. Once again, if you have access to clean drinking water, then you aren't at risk of death from lack of clean drinking water.


How is this for some citations with a capital B:


* 1.6 million people die every year from diarrhoeal diseases (including cholera) attributable to lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and 90% of these are children under 5, mostly in developing countries;
* 160 million people are infected with schistosomiasis causing tens of thousands of deaths yearly; 500 million people are at risk of trachoma from which 146 million are threatened by blindness and 6 million are visually impaired;
* intestinal helminths (ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infection) are plaguing the developing world due to inadequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene with 133 million suffering from high intensity intestinal helminths infections; there are around 1.5 million cases of clinical hepatitis A every year.

You're misinformed. No information can be transmitted. For the purposes of understanding why this is the case, a better way to think about entanglement is that two particles P and Q agree on opposite spins at the time of entanglement, when you measure the spin of particle P on an axis, you can infer the spin of particle Q on the same axis without measuring it. This isn't a completely accurate model of how things work, but it's close enough for the purposes of explaining why no information transfer occurs.
