But using a LN we would have our private key, not give our private key to coinbase.
The only information we would have, it's a warning saying "you're sending bitcoin to a certified wallet, certified by xxxxx"
Nothing would change, we could still have anonimous wallets, and one certified wallet.
The biggest problem will not be to scale up bitcoin, but to fight the states regulations and prohibition. 
I think in this way, we would have a choice certified wallets or/and normal wallets.
The central node wouldn't have control over my bitcoins or private keys, and the only thing the central node have, would be the same that all the exchanges have... Our ID.

But coinbase would have the private key of that person. If we use the LN, the private key would remain with both users.
No one would have control over the coins. 
And i don't want that registry on a database, but on the blockchain, where only the central node can see, but can't change. 
But yes, when coinbase create a LN node, I would know that those wallets are fast and trusted.
This is just an idea... I'm almost sure that someone will create this in the next few years

What if the winklevoss brothers create a central node, where everyone would just open one channel to.
We wouldn't need to open no more channels, because everyone would connect to there channel?

Nothing would change in the blockchain, it would keep decentralized... I could have 10 normal wallets and choose to have one certified wallet.
It wouldn't be impose to me... 
We already give our ID to exchange...and I would be more confident in sending bitcoin to a certified wallet than to a misterious anonimous wallet.
That would be a game changer.

Why open channels with everybody?
Why not open a channel with a "central" node... And everyone that want to have fast transactions open one channel with that node?

But, i  want to keep my documents and id private. 
I want to have a certified wallet, that only a court can make the entity where I certified the wallet to disclose that information.
I don't need to have the ID, photo, passport of the person I'm sending bitcoin, I just need to know that it has been certified, and if there exist a litigation, I can ask a court to disclose that information.

If the LN it's built in form of smart contract, I suppose they could make in the way that when i make a transaction with someone connected to that channel I would know 
Bitcoin is built in the base ou liberal use... And to not impose something to someone.
So I think it's a good idea to have the possibility to give the user a choice between a private anonimous wallet and/or a certified wallet.

So... If they implement lighting network, our clients could make payment in less than a second? Receiving in dollar automatically?
That would be a game changer.

I just want to know it its possible.
Because when selling products with low margin, and using a very volatile bitcoin would be very risky for the business.
But a small side note, the exchange wouldn't be used like a wallet, it would just exchange the bitcoin to USD and regularly send it back to the business account.
I'm looking this in a business perspective.
