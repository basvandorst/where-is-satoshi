You won't last long on Reddit if you plan to submit same lame link to 20+ subreddits. 
And regarding the law - they already had history of doing it, now they just made it official, big deal.

No, you didn't. Right now, I would invest a bit of money into BTC, but even more money and time into education about blockchain and bitcoin trading. 
It will benefit you more in the long run.

C'mon Trevor Noah, talk about bitcoin at least in "Between the scenes" part, your fellow Africans will appreaciate it

Gold is the closest thing we can compare bitcoin to. Kind of like an encyclopedia is the closest thing we can compare the internet to.

Ok, Bill:
No one has ever used USDs to purchase drugs or fund terrorists. Ever.
But then again, facts like this keep my warm at night:
Simply put, bitcoin is better money.
Provably scarce.
Global, independent of governments.
Difficult to seize or block. (barring torture)
Easy to transfer.
Humanity has never had better money. As more people realize this, price should rise. Substantially.
Gates, Buffet and other old farts will easily switch over like they always do.

Depends on how much common sense you have. What do I mean?
If you are rational and level-headed when buying and selling shitcoins then go with mining rigs. Then go and mine shitcoins, let them pump and flip them at the top -&gt; accummulate bitcoin.

I am afraid that other dictators will figure this shit out and start messing the crypto movement with their shitcoins.
This is a great way to draw attention away from your corruption and criminal activities. Or even claim big losses (as many Youtubers did in the tax season) when people ask where is the state money.

The massive UTXO set consolidation continues: We're down to 54.8M from 64.1M UTXOs, already a reduction of more than 14%. Especially, in combination with the expected increase in segwit adoption, this will dampen the fee spike of a future transaction demand spike.
