2 empty blocks in a row...

That is not fungibility. Fungibility is the notion that any two units of currency are equivalent. If there was a merchant only accepting coins from coinbase wallets for example, that would be low fungibility. As my non-coinbase bitcoin is no longer equivalent to someone else's coinbase bitcoin.

Well miners can already invalidate previous blocks, they just have to mine the block they want to invalidate and all subsequent blocks up to the block height +1. It would be ok to invalidate a block with more transactions than the last so long as 2 rules hold:
1. The invalidated block is the most recent.
2. The replacement block fully encapsulates the invalidated block. (To avoid transactions going from 1 confirmation to 0)
The only thing that concerns me with this is possibly wasting a lot of hash power. For example, say a block is mined at time t. I come along and replace it with another bigger block at time t + 5 mins. The last 5 mins of mining is completely wasted, for every. single. miner.

Great article! I learnt about change addresses only last night when I nearly shit myself seeing my bitcoin sent to a *mystery* address. I feel that confusion to do with things like this will be a major roadblock to widespread adoption.

If they're really developing on their production server I'm not surprised at all that they failed due to incompetence.

Ok, thanks for your reassurance. I've just moved from a web wallet to a local one so I'm still learning the ropes. I guess all I can do now is wait. Thanks again!

That is not proof...
I went to Mars and met the aliens. I can prove it but would be betraying a confidence to do so.

Because the company that uses ASICBOOST takes a different political viewpoint so therefore using it is morally wrong and an "attack"... this mining shortcut is not a problem anyway, the problem is that they're even allowed to patent an algorithm in the first place. It's like patenting a recipe, or a series of directions around a park. Sorry, you must grill your chicken, unless you purchase a frying license from KFC.

Seller sends a message to buyer to be signed. Buyer signs message with private key for address holding the bitcoins using the wallet of their choice. Buyer sends signed message to seller. Seller verifies signature using his own wallet or an online tool.

This is not a travelling salesman problem as you don't want to visit every node. We are only interested in the shortest path between addresses A and B regardless of which intermediary addresses are used. Transactions are directed and have equal weighting making this a "shortest path on a directed graph with unit weighted edges" problem.

I like the image of one person chanting a signed bitcoin transaction to another person so they can transmit it to the network

You're right, we can't know what kind of volume tumblers were getting around that time without them divulging some information which kind of undermines the whole point of a tumbler.

Classic Australia. Our country is constantly shooting itself in the foot by stifling innovation and blocking out entire industries. Take the state of the internet for example. There are entire industries based around it that just cannot operate here. So sick of this short sighted bullshit.

"private blockchain" is such an oxymoron

Despite you publishing the code on github there's no way of verifying that the code in the app store app is the same as the github code AFAIK. If you figure out a way of doing a checksum on app store code or something let me know because I'd be interested.

Tumbling is supposed to spend other peoples' outputs to your address.
For example, consider 3 users A, B, and C who want to tumble 5, 5, and 10 BTC respectively. The role of the tumbler is to send A's 5 and B's 5 BTC to C. And split C's 10 between A and B.
Now let's say C stole those 10 BTC. There now exists no set of transactions that link the address C stole from and C's personal address, since C's personal address contains BTC from A and B. The side effect is that A and B are implicated in the theft by using the tumbler service since the stolen BTC now reside in their addresses.

Yep, it's a fairly common problem in computer science. Take a look at [Dijkstra's Algorithm]( if you're interested.

I'd like to know an actual answer rather than a half-assed opinion... I thought SegWit is (all-but) locked in and 2Mb is on the roadmap in a couple of months. I don't understand why the fork?

Honestly this is the best one here. Bitcoin is an easy way to avoid overzealous and greedy online gambling regulations.
