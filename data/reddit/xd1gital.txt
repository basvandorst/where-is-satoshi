I do understand your point. But when I compare between raising or not raising the limit, the raising has a far better future then not raising it.
If you think we are currently fine with the current limit, then look at the mempool and the daily transactions trend, all the numbers indicates we are hitting the limit.
If you think we still have time to find a better solution, I think we are running out of time, this debate has been dragged since 2013 or earlier.

Agree! If you a developer, you know this is a simplest fix and less unknown problems. Dynamic increasing requires a lot of changes in the code, so it comes with a lot of unexpected problems. By simply increasing hard limit, it buys us more time to think and evaluate solutions for the dynamic increasing.

Agree with OP!
People who are running full nodes right now **will not drop out** because of the blocksize limit increasing.  People seem to think there will be a big jump in blocksize after the blocksize limit raised. IMO, This is wrong assumption.

First, Most merchants are already taking and accepting the risk on zero confirmation, So the % of transactions really need to RBF are pretty small. Secondly, I don't see any problem for both parties to come to an agreement to raise the fee by deduct the amount from one party or split it in half. So FFS-RBF is perfectly fine.
I had asked this question in but were ignored:
**Did core-dev really do any research to see how RBF will affect the current FFS and also what are the percentage of transactions really need this feature?**

I wished I could up vote more! I was going to post a similar one. Peter Todd keeps telling increasing block size will cause the decline of full nodes because of the incentive and bandwidth.
* Firstly, I have been running a full node for more than a year just to support the Bitcoin network without any incentive. I think most people who currently running full nodes are the same.
* Secondly, the increasing of block size limit won't happen now and importantly **the size will not jump up to 20MB right away. It will gradually increase so Nielsen's Law and Moore Law will take care of the bandwidth problem**.
* Thirdly, by the time 20MB filling up (possibly at least 5 years from now), if Lightning network or side-chains are successfully developed and tested and we may not require to do any hard-fork on the block-size again.

They simply go "YES" until all of the sudden all of their money is gone because of bad security or the company who own the keys lost them (for whatever reason).

I did't like the change either. But after talking to a lot of people about bitcoin, I realized it has to be changed.

I agree with all of your points there. But they are just a few minor disadvantages when comparing bitcoin to credit cards. So I don't think It's going to replace credit cards.

iPhone App is not important as Hardware Wallet. To become mainstream, there should be a secure but easy to use bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin apps or any bitcoin wallet software run on generic computing devices are honeypots for cyber-thieves, so hardware wallet is the only way to go.

I can make a free wallet app. A few year later, when there is enough users putting their money on my app, I will silently collecting all private keys and transfer them at once to my address and disappear.

Use Electrum to generate HD wallet with 12 words seed. If they are hard to remember at the first glance, generate a new one, until you find one that you think it's easiest to remember for you. Now try to remember them, when you done that, print a list of generated public addresses, distribute your money across these addresses. You also can email these public addresses to your friends (just in-case you want to check the balance on them). Now destroy the digital print of the wallet. From now on, every times you wake up repeat that 12 words on your head to remind you. You can also tattoo the 6 hardest-to-remember words. Good Luck.

If you own bitcoins before the fork, you coins will be on both chains. You don't have anything to worry about.

I have been running a full node for 2 years just because I love bitcoin and the main idea behide it. I think majority bitcoiners here are doing the same, running a full bitcoin node is just a way to support the network without expecting getting anything back.

Raising the limit doesn't mean we will see 20MB blocks right away. If the bitcoin adoption is expanding, more tech companies and computer geeks will join in and they will run full nodes for sure. My Internet bandwith is only 10MB at home, but I have no problem to run a full node (and download more than 500GB of TV shows every month)

My idea is that Bitcoin after a hard-fork, caused by about 75% of the network hashing power, is a new Bitcoin, but It's not an alt-coin. You may not agree with this idea. The question is:
Will I get banned for promoting this idea?

This is just a theory. 1MB limit has the same chance to be DOSed as 2MB. 2MB will cost 2x for spammer to spam the network.

Bitcoin at the current state deserves this lame. Because Mike points out a lot of facts. If bitcoin wants to success, these problems are needed to be fixed. But I do believe we, bitcoin enthusiasts, will overcome and make bitcoin stronger. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:55:13
First, the fork only happens when 3 things are happened in order:
* **1**. 75% miners show their support (It may take minimum a week to see this; 1000 blocks)
* **2**. 1 month grace period before Classic nodes accept blocks above 1MB and up to 2MB
* **3**. A miner set their block-mining limit above 1MB
So at minimum, bitcoin nodes will have 5 weeks (of 1 &amp; 2) to consider and decide what they gonna do. Especially big exchanges, exchanges most likely will follow the hash power. And miners need exchanges to sell their coins. So it's a very close loop and incentive to follow the hash power.
For number **3**, It's gonna be very interesting to see which miners have the courage to raise their soft limit.
edit: fixed grammar

Up until now, everything in bitcoin protocol is based purely on math. So the outcome is somewhat predictable. If BIP 100 is implemented, the blocksize limit will be based human, especially miners. We know math can't be bribed and greedy, And human does make errors and change. So we can't put 100% hope on miners doing the right thing. I seriously hope people see this problem and don't put your XT hatred by agreeing on any other solution
@_date: 2015-08-05 12:45:01
When you solve the problem by putting all the valid unconfirmed transactions into a block with a special number including a special transaction that rewards your-self 25 bitcoins, you tell everyone on the network that you have solved this block by broadcasting it, Everyone can easy check and see if your block is valid. If all the people agree that your block is valid, then the reward 25 bitcoins becomes valid. But you have to wait at least 100 confirmations before you can spend this newly minted bitcoins. In short: your bitcoins is valid only all people on the network agree so. Virus can steal bitcoins from infected machine but can NOT create new bitcoins or spend invalid bitcoins.

I have a few questions: Bitcoin network is not aware of the real-world exchange rate (and it shouldn't be), how can we define a spam transaction? How can we 100% sure that a spam filter won't accidentally reject legitimate transactions? 
IMO: spam filter should be optional. Rather than enforce it in the protocol, individual nodes will decide to enable it, or automatically enable it when some parameters are met. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:52:56


Just like Bitcoin the earlier days, to have a wallet you have to run a full node. Now, you don't need too. OB will be the same, someone will offer to host your content/products for a fee. 


This is true, people pay premium for protection. All the items that you can buy with credit card have included at least 3% to cover credit card's processing. This is a hidden fee that most consumers don't know. If you're a high rating seller and sell things cheaper, people will take that risk and buy from you.

Hashing power = security of the network = value of the coin. The network will split only if 75% of hash power on one side. The coin with more hashing power will have more value, thus attracts more hashing power.

"shitload of money" from bitcoin mining could be 10 or 100 millions top. For Intel it is a very small market. The problem is the more chips produced, the harder to sell them. You constantly have to make the chips better and can sell only a certain number of the chips.

The way I see is an alt-coin with different rules, it could be an opened or closed system. Because bitcoin is an opened system, so it needs "Proof of work" to secure its network. A closed alt-coin system doesn't need that much power to secure. Bitcoin likes an open-forum without registration. A closed system will require some sort of ID to join and participate. That's why I agree with Andrea Antonopoulos about future market will have multiple coins co-exists, Bitcoin will be the big one and serve general purposes, then there will be a lot of other alt-coins for other special purposes (without using sidechains)

I might not explain clearly or you see different thing than me. So I will try one more time :)  
In my opinion: Blockchain is a distrusted trust-less network that provides a tamper-proof data structure across the network. Please don't separate these 2 keys thing.  
* I can put some restriction in my network to enhance the security of the network; such as: only allow some certain nodes, but It doesn't mean it's not a trust-less network. It still is because if less-than 50% of my nodes are hacked, my network still operates properly. So I have a redundancy and security. A simple centralized server doesn't have these 2 things, especially security. Yes a hacker may be able to get my database, but it won't be able to do big damage to it.  
* And Data Structure can be SQL, no SQL or other types of database. It depends on the need of my application.
@_date: 2015-03-22 07:15:34
CorporateCoin/FedCoin/BankCoin can use blockchain technology. To secure this type of closed network isn't hard. Here is my 2 cents.
1. Every nodes will be miners and need to be in a central approved list. You can not join if your identity is not on the list. This central approved list is signed and using multi-sig (modifying the list is required multiple parties to sign).
2. All nodes should have similar hash rate, so a compromised node won't be able to do much. The network will monitor its self if a node appears to have more power.

Just a reminder, you are asking about the developers of just 1 software that is built for Bitcoin network. Yes it's the main one right now and most people use it. But You can build your own software as long as your software supports the protocol that most nodes use, it will work fine. In another word, if a change is made in a protocol (hard-fork) by one of these guys, it won't affect the network unless the majority (including other bitcoin software) agree to upgrade.

@_date: 2015-03-10 22:43:46
I think you misunderstand about the blocksize limit problem. This problem is not a current problem. The network will work fine with 1MB cap for 5 years (or even 10 years) from now. This is a known future problem only if bitcoin is getting bigger. Fixing a future problem, with a consensus network like bitcoin, needs a lot of times to get everybody upgrade their software to get a better consensus on the network (meaning the hard-fork will happen smoothly). So I think you just worry too much. First, it won't happen right away, it would take at least 3 years (in my estimation). Secondly, you won't see the size of the block jumping big overnight after the switch. It will just gradually increase. You will be fine
