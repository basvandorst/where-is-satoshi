Agree \- for some time it could still be around 7k, but I think that will change in the near future. The market is still new and there are so many great projects out there besides our main "Bitcoin".

Woops, actually this is the linK: [

Luckily, it should be able to be translated through google chrome....Might as well try to make a translate action available on the website, thanks for criticism!  
Right click on the page \*Translate to xYourlanguagex\*

Sorry to hear that, I just tried it on my browser and it works great if you translate it to english on PC. Next step is a translater for mobile ;-)

I think you are right!
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:34:48
Actually agree again. It helps a lot that we have a "main" coin to focus on and not 10.000 different coins! 
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:33:54
Hahaha, made me laugh a lot!

Doesn't matter, I have been told that reddit is a great place to post ideas and discuss stuff. Rather than twitter which is full of people who just likes and doesn't give a damn :D

I too think it's a bad time to sell off. The technical analysts are also turning their head upside down right now, because no one knows how to figure out what to do. We might go into a long time bear mode if this continues, but also I think there might be some good things about these drops. Obviously people wants to buy in more than ever.

Honestly I think he is right. In 1 year, I think there's a whole new level of what we call "bullrun".

I think you are right, honestly \- if it breaks 7800 I think we could easily see 9200!

Maybe a little bit more, but I am not so sure about it!
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:23:50
In that case, it doesn't really matter selling now. You can just hold on and spend crypto as usual. I think we are early adopters comparing to what's going to happen in the future.
