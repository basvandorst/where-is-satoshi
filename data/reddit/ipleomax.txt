I'm ready.

If by two years you mean this year's January, yeah sure.

VISA hasn't had existing companies bullshitting with their adoption, Crypto-currencies are direct rivals to these giants and are still thriving. 
Its probably people like you that's impeding the technological progress too. Anyway, I'm not arguing with someone who knows little to nothing about technology. And the fact that you used the term 'nerd' negatively shows how you think. Meh, worthless.

Roger Ver is damaging Bitcoin AND BCash at the same time. What a retard.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:36:51
'Withdraw'. The part its trying to replace, lol.
Wallet to wallet, f\*\*\* third\-party accounts.
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:12:23
Oh no! Don't act like regular credit cards don't have any flaws at all!
1. Lost.
2. Expired.
3. Have to carry multiple cards for multiple bank accounts.
4. Blocked if transaction fails multiple times.
5. Stolen \[report to bank to block existing card and get new one = inconvenience\].
6. Regional restrictions in many cases.
7. Have to go to ATMs to 'withdraw' cash.
8. Damaged.
All of this can be avoided by a virtual crypto\-wallet. 
Also, ever heard of Offline wallet/Ledger Nano? You could literally set up same wallet on any number of devices. Losing your ledger \+ store not having internet \+ no charge on phone at the same just means you are unfortunate. Don't blame crypto\-wallets.

Worthy of daily repost tbh.

If you lose your phone, your wallet is NOT lost on that phone. As long as you have the seed/phrase, you can literally regenerate the same wallet with the same balance anywhere in any device.
Please educate yourself about crypto/blockchain technologies.
And no, if someone steals your phone, they cannot see the wallet seed, its never shown. You get the seed when you create the wallet \[or account in case you insist on using a third\-party service to manage your wallet, Coinbase for example\].

VISA was founded in 1958. Bitcoin in 2008. Give it time and it will. Go check out Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

Is this for Odoo? Any GitHub or website I can view?

``` sounds great. kek.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:14:16
Its either because of [this]( or [this](

Visa UK &amp; Ireland's ex-CEO has recently joined a crypto currency project called Crypterium.
Its all his doings! /s
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:10:21
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:51:02
Yeah, more appropriate to compare Visa and Lightning. Just need some more months for Lightning to mature. Then we're set.

You think a war can wipe out every copy of bitcoin's ledger?
Goodluck recovering fiat from a city wiped out by nukes.
Bitcoin on the other hand, I just ask another node anywhere in the world. I get a full copy. In case communication via internet is disabled, I can physically gain it using flash/hard drive.
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:08:17
This is for you fam.
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:28:18
You need an authorized seller or verified middleman to know that anyway. In both cases, digital currency or not.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:55:15
Agree. I did add Bitcoin to my reply, didn't mention its data only. It's just common sense that I'm referring to Bitcoin core being open source and block chain data being public.
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:23:27
How do people not realize this. SMH.
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:32:16
He's obviously talking about Bitcoin and its block-chain data being open-source. Not the explorer.
Sorry if I failed to read your sarcasm (if any).
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:47:13
If you actually read his post, you'd find out that he talks about moving money out of Dubai first (before investing). And the responses I showed talk about that part specifically.
So he wants to do both "Transfer" and "Invest".
I'm talking about the transfer part.
EDIT: I'm not allowed to post links on this sub-reddit, but here is the quote from him:


You can search it on personalfinance subreddit to cross-check.
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:30:32
Let me evaluate your response:


False, this is a real problem.


False, I only provided solution to one problem here, which is transferring money.

Its almost like bitcoin vs bcash = round earth vs flat earth.
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:15:23
Thats what most people don't seem to understand.
Yeah, a lot of us are smart enough to not get scammed by this shit. But imagine beginners / regular people who want to get into crypto. It will only leave them with bad taste in their mouth.
