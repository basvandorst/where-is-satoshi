We wrote the contract so that up to a week before the agreed date either side could cancel.  Something I typically do for people I personally know.  I don't want to be an 'asshole' business owner who only cares about money and not about his clients.

That's kinda the one fear I have that I believe could kill crypto currencies.  If the large banking conglomerates decided to 'take a loss' and buy up enough of the coinage of crypto currencies for the express purposes of wrecking it.  Blowing $100,000,000 to maintain their financial dominance would probably be seen as an acceptable cost to them.

I can personally vouch that ~1000 coins of mine have been obliterated into nothingness when my netbook was stolen back in 2011.  Thankfully it was encrypted, so at least the thief didn't get rich.  Wasn't so much of a big deal when they were 2$ a pop... now it just makes me sick. 
But its my fault for leaving my netbook in my car when I was out eating.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:13:40
Some of us came to get into crypto currency for philosophical reasons and **not** as a way to get rich.
As such I split money amongst several crypto currencies.  So I've made *a lot* less money than if I dumped everything into bitcoin.  But id rather support cryptocurrency in general and see its wide spread adoption. 
If you've made millions where I've only made a few thousand (if I sold them all) - so be it.
 If that makes me a loser - so be it.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:25:00
I wish there was something we could do to combat the wave of crap that will be said about btc whenever the bubble pops.  
I just hope we can keep pushing for real ways to use them for daily life.  My gut keeps telling me if we can make it eaiser to use... in the long run (10 years or more) bitcoin will be stable.  We've just got to figure out how to keep the commercial early adopters on board when it does come down.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:00:51
To be completely blunt... neither one of us considered what November would hold. We both figured a mild change, maybe something like 10%.   Which we were both comfortable with.  Depending on which way it went one of would benefit.  A 300% never even entered our mind.

@_date: 2013-11-18 23:28:54
Only thing is... as the price keeps jumping... more and more people are going to want to buy Btc to hold for 'getting rich'.  Which will just keep driving the price up until it runs out of steam.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:08:56
Problem I see is that there is so much of a buying frenzy... that every time we hit a quick dip... they are bought up because people just want to buy when its down 20 points.
So any correction the market may make... is countered by people buying for emotional reasons.  
I see that as dangerous.  As bitcoin become emotional...it makes the backwards swing worse.  Whenever this breaks... a lot of people will have all those positive emotions turn very negative.
The higher it goes before breaking... the worse the backlash.
My fear is that if the backlash is bad enough... it'll hurt societal adoption because it'll leave a bad taste in peoples mouth. (So to speak).
We've seen this before in our lifetimes... anyone remember how near impossible is was to get an upstart going *after* the Dot Com bubble burst?

That type of clause may be something I use in the future... but basing everything on the USD rate seems somewhat counter productive.
Because then I'm just working for USD in the form of Btc.  The point of using Btc (for me at least) is to get away from basing everything on USD.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:25:57
What's the point of a currency other than to be used?
The agreement was made with the understanding that the price would change a little, but we did not expect a 3 fold change.  We were both ok with a slight change in price, but a drastic price obviously isn't something he's comfortable with.  If you take the cash value of what the coins were worth when we made the contract... he's not willing to pay that equivalent in bitcoins, because, 'Those coins might be worth 10 grand in a year.
So regardless of what the USD/BTC rate is... he's unwilling to spend **ANY** Btc because they 'might make me rich'.

when an alt coin is first made its extremely fragile... and also cheap. Look at the list: 
Besides... If you're the banking institutions... you dont attack Bitcoin by attacking bitcoin.  You attack it by undermining the overall trust and faith in crypto currencies in general.  The most obvious way to do this is to attack the  spot.  Wreck Litecoin and use their media buddies to slander crypto currency so that the general population wont touch it - using the Litecoin fiasco as proof that crypto currency is bad.
A well planned out attack against the public image of crypto currencies, would set them back for probably a decade or so.  Crypto currency is still in its infancy, its more vulnerable now than at any other time. 
They wont need to buy up every currency if they can utterly destroy one quickly. And if the Banking Institutions decided to... they could bring any crypto currency down to its knees within a day.  That memory will be burned into societies mind.
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:17:00
I cannot even begin to explain how much this winners/losers mentality pisses me off.
OP, Bitcoins long term viability depends on the very people you are calling losers.  We need people who have not jumped in to get involved.  Even if they haven't gotten into the bitcoin ecosystem - we still need them to.  Even if they were naysayers - we still need them to get active.
Turning this into a "lol - u mad bro" joke about how they "lost" is downright childish.
Bitcoin as an *investment currency only* will ultimately fail.  
Bitcoin will only reach long term viability once it can be eaisly used as an actual currency.  Until that happens it could be said that *we all are losers*. 
I can't wait for the *'I want to get rich'* bitcoiners to leave.  For a currency to work... it must flow.  Not be hoarded by people who just want to be richer.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:14:51
Assuming OP is a true geek... i'd wager he sat at his computer watching the price go up and down while muttering under his breath... *'come on, come on, just a little more... almost leet... just a little more... almost there... a little more.... BAZINGA!'* [queue SCREENCAP]
That's probably *not* what happened... but I want to believe!

Thanks for the alt-coin comments.  Specifically I was thinking about ltc or ppc.  Not one of the smaller less know coins.  Basically one that someone can eaisly change btc into on a site like btc-e.

Yea I expected that... I keep hoping that common sense will actually come into the btc universe.
Maybe its wishfull thinking... but afterall I was an idealist for getting into btc in the first place... I really want it to survive just for philosophical reasons.  Just worried the 'get rich quick' mentality will eventually kill it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:30:37






I tried to save the contract.  But in the end, he's unwilling to spend **any** coins, because they 'might make me rich' as he said.
I was even willing totake the cash value of what the coins were worth when we made the contract... and have him pay that cash value in Btc today.  But he's not willing to do that because, 'Those coins might be worth 10 grand in a year".
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:40:58
Yea i think someone was definitely trying to stop the slide there with a couple of those transactions.  When you see the price dropping and then all of a sudden you see a flood of trades buying at 20+ points above what people are selling for... and all at the same exact value - it stands out.
I think I saw like 50 seperate trades fly by at 650 when selling offers were in the low 610s.

Trying to sell my 98 Triumph Speed Triple for btc.  Almost finalized a deal with a local buyer last night, but he decided to get a Ducati instead.  Ill keep listing her.  Kinda hard to sell for btc only in the real world... but I'm trying.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:02:03
Fair point, but then what's the point of even bothering with Btc then?  The point was he had coins he was comfortable with spending, and I was fine with doing the work for non USD payment.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:38:10
and yet there are people out there that still consider the btc 'stable'
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:51:05
Ya know what's an even cheaper way of transfering USD?  USD.
Using Btc as a transfer service is pointless to me (others might think its great).
I've got tons of other options to transfer money to other people... including my own two hands.
Transfering money is not why I want to use Btc.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:27:11
wow, thanks man.  Totally unnecessary, but very appreciated.  That's my first Btc tip on reddit. :)
Let's **not** say *you* were my first though... that might make things uncomfortable. lmao
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:05:13
yea, but in contrast to what they would be worth today... 2000 seems trivial.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:17:17
I don't really care what the price is... just as long as its somewhat stable so I can use them, and encourage other people to do the same.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:22:13
I understand what you saying from an economic point of view. (ignoring the generation of wealth via mining)
That's actually in line with the position I'm making my statements from.  I'm not talking about bitcoin being used for the aquisition of wealth, but as a practical currency. 
The arbitrary number value of something I want to buy isn't really important (to me) as long as its priced adequatly compared to everything else.  That's why a college education in the 50s from Harvard was like $6,000 a year and its closer to $60,000 today.  Yes it was 10x cheaper in the past... but everything was 10x cheaper in the past - "Thanks Inflation".
Unfortunately there is the intermediary cross over period were one currency is compared to another - and that's where the 'get rich quick hoarders' come into play.  
Maybe I'm the weird one, but I don't really care what the exactly 1btc = in $s.  So long as the btc cost of something appropiately priced.  (Yes I realize there is a flaw in this logic, since until a currency because dominate... its value will directly be viewed according to its exchange rate.)

I don't have an arbitraty # to give you that I've calculated out.  I'm not making a statement about what the rate *should* be... I'm making a statement about what it *shouldn't* be.  Those are not the same thing.  Inclusive vs Exclusive.
A 300% increase in two weeks is not realistic in my opinion.  If it is... then if that 'realistic' trend continues then a single Btc would be worth +$16,000 by the end of December 2013.
An exponential increase in such a short time (imho) is not realistic or viable.

@_date: 2013-11-18 14:57:28
Yea I didn't think about having that in there and not enforcing it.  
The client already had Btc, so he wasn't going to be buying any to pay me.  He was just going to use what he already had on hand.  That's why he liked the idea of using them for payment.  But the 'I might be rich if I hold onto these' idea got into his head, so he doesn't want to spend them now.
I tried to convince him to just pay me in USD based on the exchange rate on the day of the contract signing, but he doesn't have the USD liquid assets to pay that out right now.  Another reason why Btc was appealing.  He wasn't spending any USD from his business bank account.
