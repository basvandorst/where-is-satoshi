I would report to both... the Australian police should be helpful on this. Also try to provide their information like what is there Australian Business Number. Here it is 
Also the busines names owner and address is listed on the Australian securities and investment comission site. I would call and complain to them and see if they can advise on steps you can take. 
I would send a formal letter (snail mail) to the address listed for the business owner demanding your money back in X days or you will commence legal proceedings. 
Take to twitter and publicly request your refund ensuring others can see your request in their twitter feed. Do this daily. 
They are also listed as supporting the bitcoin foundation. I would make them aware of this issue as well.
Put the pressure on this crook. All the information is there to find this guy and make him pay.

No, so you're missing the point a bit, you don't connect BTC with the bank. You're transferring to a friend and they give you BTC in exchange. I have actually bought BTC with CC before but after on time the bank kept shutting down my CC. I blew up at 'em ehh mate.
