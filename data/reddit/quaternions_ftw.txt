Thanks for the advice. I just joined this  sub and this post popped up. I was going to Google how to get started with bitcoin, any other good sites/videos/links you know of?

Yeah, but the internet is just a fad; like the pet rock.

It's crazy how many mailing lists I *accidentally* signed up for using this email...

And you could demand millions in bitcoin, by representing yourself as the hacker

There is no specific reason I can give you why I suggested localbitcoins. I asked the question precisely because I don't know. I'll look into bitcoin ATM. Thanks!

I'm not saying that. The poster was a little ambiguous, and I was attempting to clarify what I interpreted his post to mean. 
If the hacker already sold the list on the dark web, there might be many people with it claiming to be the hacker and that muddies the water. 
I really have no opinion on this, as all of it is way over my head. I was just attempting to clarify what that poster had said, and why he may gave said it. Cheers.

Yeah, you might 5 be right. I'll keep looking. In his post he says the exchange cost is 17 EGP per US dollar. So to buy USD 100 costs him the equivalent of USD 280. So I think even at $900US per coin it would save him a ton of money

I am new to bitcoin. I was introduced to it in the Joe Rogan podcast interview with Andreas Antonopoulos. He mentioned the ease of transferring coin between people and it's low transaction cost.
I was thinking he could buy bitcoin in Egyptian pound and send it to his family where they could buy what he needs (using bitcoin or) after exchanging it to their local currency and bring the items to him personally. Or buy bitcoin in Egyptian pound, buy what he wants online with it and have it sent to his trusted family/friends to bring to home personally. Would this be cheaper than the exchange rates he's getting now?
