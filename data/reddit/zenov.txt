Store a copy of your seed words somewhere other than your house people. If your hardware wallet and seedwords are in the same house what the hell is the point? Keep a copy at your parents, or bro/sis etc. If you have more then around $10k I would question why not have a copy in a safe deposit box at a local bank. 
Do not lose your investments because of complacency. Think about what you're doing and how to be smart about it then go one step further.

Hi Sara. I believe you have a ledger nano s hardware wallet there. Do not ever tell anyone that 5 digit PIN OR any of the words on that list.
The 5 digit PIN is to unlock the wallet and it is entered on the USB itself. To move past the first number you actually push both buttons at once to confirm it then it will move to the next. Once you complete the pin just use the buttons to scroll to Bitcoin and push both at the same time again. Computer will likely connect and pull up the wallet app. He may have used Google chrome apps in which case you may need to open the Bitcoin ledger chrome app manually.
Again, please don't give anyone anymore info than you have here. We don't need more than this really to help you. If you would like further help please don't hesitate to reply here or to anyone else who has offered in  this thread, as keeping it public is good to have consensus that the help is legit. 
I am very sorry for your loss. That is far too young. I do wish you all the best for the future.

You want him to use half his btc for a trezor? Just do a paper wallet.
