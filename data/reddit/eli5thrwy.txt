Depends. If you bought $1000 worth of BTC right now and traded it for $1000 worth of ETH like 3 seconds later.. you'd most likely owe zero taxes but technically you'd still have to report it.  
Now, if you trade $1000 worth of BTC (at today's price), that you bought for $200 a year ago, for $1000 worth of ETH you'd owe taxes on $800 of gains even though you didn't cash out to USD at all.

At an extreme cost of time and money to enforce it. Look at the biggest example of that... the whole Java debacle.

Bitcoin are never in "offline" storage. They're always present in the blockchain. You mean keep your private keys offline.

Calm down. Open source is a security risk too. You can't guarantee the APK you download from the Play Store is built from the same code posted on Github. No one audits random small open source projects thoroughly. The whole idea is that it *could* be audited that creates a false sense of security with open source software. Are you going to audit it? Then how do you know even if you compile it yourself from the code available that there's nothing nefarious going on? Because people would say so? How many bitcoin traders have enough coding and/or security experience to properly audit an application? Very few. How many of those would be using this app? Even less.  
Not everything in this world can be open source, especially if he's trying to make some money off of it. He open sources it and there's immediately be nine other apps out there taking up install numbers and revenue from him. If you don't trust the app don't use it, don't knock on people who want to make a living from their side work though.

What do you mean? You can fork it right now if you wanted. You can go create your very own altcoin called DesmondJonesCoin in 3 minutes for free that comes with a wallet program that you can start mining in to. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:54:09
I think you're misunderstanding the point in using a hardware wallet. The weakest link any the chain of any wallet is compromise. What's more likely, someone infects a million PCs with malware that scans for wallet.dat, private keys, etc and harvests them all.... or someone breaks into your house and steals a piece of paper? It's definitely the former.  
You also don't HAVE to keep the seed written down. You could put them in a text document, encrypt that with AES256 and store a copy on each of your computers, your phone, your tablets, in your email accounts, on all your cloud drives, on a USB stick at your relatives house, in your car, etc. I mean at that point if someone obtains your encrypted document and breaks AES256 to get your seed to recreate your wallet... I feel like they'd just break into the Coinbase wallet and take all their coins.

US as a whole, federal level. Trading BTC for ETH on an exchange is a taxable event. It's absolutely ridiculous because of situations such as autoexchange mining pools where you might have 30,000 transactions that are taxable in a year.

"Zero-fee Crypto Trading"  
Can't happen
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:50:40
The fuck? You do realize for a trade to happen (and yes, an Exchange could technically hold all Exchange coins in one wallet and change your balance on the screen without moving any coins) it has to be inputted into the blockchain. For blocks to be confirmed you need people "mining." People aren't going to mine for free. You can't have PoW with no fees, period. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:13:40
Why do people do it? Free money. If you had 100 BTC and created a 1:1 fork you'd have 100 of those new coins. If you could somehow get it to say $3,000 like Bitcoin Cash did.. that's $300,000 for free. Imagine why someone like Roger Ver, who probably had a ton of BTC wanted to create a fork and get it as valuable as possible. Same thing with altcoins. Create one, pre-mine a bunch and hold, get it listed on an exchange, pump it up and dump all of your coins. Walk away. Or go for the popular new con of "Initial Coin Offerings" (ICO) where you pre-mine millions of coins and sell coins directly to clients for what you market as a substantial discount to what it'll debut on an exchange for. That way you're straight up collecting money and don't have to "gamble" that it pumps up enough for you to make a decent chunk of change. People are making tens to hundreds of millions off ICOs right now.
Why CAN you fork? Options. What if the Chinese eventually controlled 80% of the network? Can't really trust it. You could fork it over to "Bitcoin2", everyone who had X amount of BTC has the same amount of BTC2 now and you can start fresh.. maybe even do a few upgrades to the code that you couldn't do to BTC itself.

But the intent is to keep your seed as safe as possible but still retain control over access to it. If I put my seed in a safe, you just have to break into the safe.. not exactly hard. Even if I put my seed in a bank vault, there's insider threats, robberies, etc. These also are very centralized. If I'm in Dubai and need access to my Bitcoin wallet right now but my Trezor got destroyed, and my paper seed is in Chicago in a safe... doesn't really help me. So I can encrypt it and use something like "abluedinosauronlyeatspurpleorangesforasnack" ... that statement is a lot easier to remember than 24 random words and is effectively just as secure. Now my seed isn't stored *anywhere* in plain text (in a safe, in a bank vault.. still plain text). I also have access to it from anywhere in the world, I can download the encrypted file on a sanitized VM or live cd, pull the machine off the net, decrypt the file and voila.. there's my seed.

What do you mean how could it exist? If all of the exchanges went away today... there would still be all of the Bitcoins there are now. Do you mean how would people obtain new bitcoins? Mining. If not mining, you can conduct peer-to-peer transfers without exchanges. We could meet up at starbucks, I could hand you $300 cash and you could send $300 worth of BTC to my wallet. Or I could pay you in kit kat bars. Now you have BTC.. send it off to someone anywhere in the world. If they want to convert it back to their own fiat they can do the same in opposite. Doesn't require a formal exchange like Coinbase. Coinbase just facilitates an easier way to exchange for the common person. It was pretty hard to "buy" BTC years ago. Not many exchanges accepted bank accounts or debit cards. Nearly zero accepted Paypal. You had localbitcoins but a majority of those wanted paid-in-cash with receipt gift cards in exchange... which wasn't a quick thing and somewhat of a hassle.  
Point being, Bitcoin doesn't have to be tied to a fiat. It just is right now because it makes it easier for the average person to assign value to it. If I asked you for 10,000 BTC right now would you give it to me? No, you'd see they're worth ~$15k USD each and tell me to fuck off. You're assigning value to each bitcoin based off value you derive from the USD. If I asked you for a dollar on the street would you give it to me? Maybe. Because you know a dollar isn't a whole lot. You don't have to convert USD to anything, you just know instinctively what you can buy with a buck. Exchanges help bridge that gap.

Then let there be some option that allows you to customize the fee. Default is whatever it is now for the avg user, more knowledgeable people can change it.

Have to be ID verified though, which doesn't work half the time if you haven't already gotten verified. And if for some reason it doesn't take your ID card you're just shit out of luck... Coinbase has no procedure for talking to someone and working through it manually.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:46:58
People are worried for no reason. You can't just randomly decide "hey I'm going to short Bitcoin!" and get paid if it drops. There has to be someone on the other side willing to accept your short, and pay you if it drops.

Sadly for a lot of people it's impossible to get verified right now :(

Sorry to hear that but..  
1) Sounds like you couldn't afford to sink $1000 into BTC if that has put you in a position you can't pay rent, buy food, etc.  
2) Are you sure they really took it out twice? Sometimes you'll get a preauth and an actual charge and it could be your bank just hasn't dropped the preauth yet (so you really haven't lost the money, the bank is just showing you having less of a balance until it drops).  
3) Your bank shouldn't require investigation time before giving you your money back, most good banks these days will credit your account immediately for fraud charges... then investigate... and if it was fraudulent you keep the credited cash, if not they take it back.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:54:24
Why not? You're looking at bitcoin as a legacy system. You don't have to buy one bitcoin. The price of one bitcoin is just a number when it comes to the average person. I can go buy $20 worth of bitcoin right now. If thousands of people do that the demand for 0.000004 bitcoin goes up, the price might rise to $25 for that amount.. and the overall price of one full bitcoin jumps a thousand bucks.  
That's why people who think it'll crash are absurd. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:49:52
I kind of look at it as legitimizing Bitcoin even more. The Bitcoin network uses more power than 150 countries now. Meaning there's inherently a physical backing to the currency in a way (power production). So even though people like to talk about how Bitcoin is just some fake made up digital numbers it's very different than say... me claiming I have invented a new digital currency and everyone in this thread gets 10,000 of it. That's meaningless. Bitcoin has "physical" $$$ behind it in the terms of power cost.. so at a minimum it should never drop below the value to create it.

Is that like a coping method? Saying Bitcoin will correct itself to an arbitrary number?  
One, you don't know it'll correct itself. If you did you'd be making billions flipping stocks/crypto. Two, you can't use historical data to make accurate future predictions when things are changing daily like more countries getting into Bitcoin, userbase exploding, investment firms saying they might start buying coins up, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:43:48
Doesn't really matter unless you were intending on flipping them immediately. Coinbase charges you immediately and you are locked in at the price when you click buy. If it goes up $2000 in those 10 days you still have the same amount of coin as when you hit buy they're just worth more now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:30:06
Terrible idea.  
And I only say this because it takes about 9 seconds to go to a mining calculator, plop in the Antminer S9 and electrical cost and see if it will be profitable. Why would you ask on here?  
And what are you spending $40k on? 10 S9s is like $15000 from Bitmain (which you have to buy via Bitcoin Cash). Their power supplies and some AC units are not going to cost you another $25000.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:41:03
There is no inherent value of one altcoin versus bitcoin.. they both are based off the USD. So converting $400 of LTC to BTC is still $400 (minus any sort of fees associated with the conversion).

Not fundamental but an important part combined with scarcity and work. Imagine if gold just appeared on the surface of Earth in mass quantities. It didn't require mining. Everyone had equal access to it and it required no work to obtain. Do you really think it would hold much value? Even ignoring it's rarity, do you think gold would be as valuable now if it didn't require expensive mining operations to obtain?   
Obviously right now Bitcoin's value is very speculative, but people who say it has no value because it's digital I think are ignoring the whole tangible cost of producing the coins. At 30 TWh (and I'm sure it's more now) of global energy usage on the network, that's about $1.5 billion USD per year in energy costs. That's a lot of money.
