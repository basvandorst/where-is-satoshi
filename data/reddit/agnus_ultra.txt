I think you got phished. What kind of documents did you give them? Did you have 2FA set up?
They were vague with their reasoning to "freeze" your account so they could scare you into giving up the documents. (I imagine they attempted to brute force their way into the account, locking it in the process, and emailing you pretending to be Binance.)

Greed is the excess of wanting things. Wanting things and striving for things is healthy. When you accumulate something to the point of detriment to yourself and/or others, that is Greed. Sure we don't need laptops and Internet, in the same way we dont need cars or trains or planes.
Apathy is rampant, and it is definitely an issue (you can observe this in realtime by scrolling through this board!). Lack of sympathy for ourselves, and in turn lack of empathy for others. 
I'm not sure that we are ready for the world that Satoshi envisioned.

"Cryptocurrency" is over.
The parentals are here are are laying down the rules. It is done. We are moving towards official adoption and definition. Now is the time to re-assess and commit to your assets of choice before its too late. Avoid any new "ICO"s, they are fraud; new projects are too late. Look for new projects after regulation is solidified near the end of this year or early next.

I'm not saying that anyone trying to make money is inherently greedy.
I am saying there are entities that utilize things like trade bots on massive scales (which are a detriment to any economy, imo), to manipulate prices and exploit naivety, making ridiculous amounts of cash while destroying the market in the process. That is what I consider Greed. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:08:17
I agree that lack of consciousness leads to inhumanity. And I don't think paying to have a building named after you is Greed, its just Lust for one self (Even more so if it was under the guise of charity).

Its extremely inefficient. If BTC becomes 'the one', the hope is that the combination of energy inefficiency from mining and the global reliance on the currency itself will spur innovation in the energy sector (think nuclear powered quantum mining rigs, ha). I hope this happens for the sake of BTC, otherwise we will be unable to physically sustain the system (this is obviously a world-shattering problem if BTC does indeed become 'the one'. Imagine a world where everyone owns a boat, but only a small fraction of the entire population had access to the water required to sail them).
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:48:52
Not worse, but it probably depends on one's goals. If body count is the focus, nuclear weaponry is probably one of the most effective things at our disposal, but population density is so high nowadays it would be difficult to actually contain a nuclear detonation's damage to just one target/area. Everyone is connected now.  
Disinformation a more effective tool to divide, control, and conquer. Once you control a population, be it subliminally or ideologically, you can sicc your group onto any other tribe at any time. An army vested in your personal interests where each individual is a potential weapon/tool/asset. I think it's much more condusive to achieving actual change. Destruction through cultivation. Isn't that something.

It helps moving the tech forward by keeping those who know how to control- in control. 
The thesis is: modern human civilization is not ready to govern itself yet. We do not know how properly communicate or reach consensus with eachother, nor is there enough compassion towards eachother for a sovereign system to be sustained. When the masses are given sudden power, they tend to annhialate themselves after initial propsperity. Lack if moderation, rationality, and balance.
Technology like social media and telecommunication was supposed to help with this, but certain forces have infiltrated certain infrastructures over the years, and these technologies are now another tool for crowd control (misinformation, obfuscation, distraction; all done at the speed of light). 
I believe this entire market is an experiment to test whether or not we are ready to discern truth and lie, whether or not we are able to put empathy before greed, and to see how participants react to crises. I imagine the majority of the participants in this experiement have reacted exactly as expected so far. Consider each "coin" or project as an experiment of its own (pay attention to the types of people each coin attracts and pay attention to the rhetoric in the individual groups as well as the overall space). The test is ongoing.
