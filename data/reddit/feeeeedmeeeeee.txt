I hope the guy that said he would literally eat his left testicle if it 10k in 2017 has been looking up recipes, and setting up a live stream of the event.

Im really sad those didn't catch on in the US. We had them for a couple years under the name "Chevrolet SS". u/dougdemuro mentions in a video that they only sold about 5k of them. Thanks Obama...

thanks! I'll give it a shot!

I don't know, but I've been trying to find a litecoin miner that doesn't show up as a trojan for almost two weeks. Got any leads?

I agree. I've been using this app for a minute this drives me crazy. The website allows mBTC, but the app doesn't. Oh well, I'll just move the decimal in my head like some kind of barbarian.

I'm not sure what he's *trying* to say, but to me, it appears as though he's trying to plant a seed of discredit in the minds of **potential** Bitcoin supporters who may only be hearing about it now. Older investors, and maybe preppers looking to get out of a failing currency without having to move across the planet to get into a good economy.
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:25:46
And it's THIS kind of logical publicity that has banks, credit card companies, and governments who issue money scrambling to find a way to stop it, regulate it, or outlaw it.
Mark my words, Bitcoin is going to be dragged through the muck, linked to "Terror plots", and all sorts of other stuff- very publicly, while stuff like THIS gets blacklisted.

This is why I have some faith in Bitcoin. People don't just throw 500K around on risky investment schemes. At least not anybody I've ever met....

Thank you, sir.
 I appreciate your interest in educating yourself about his emerging technology. If only more elected officials took the initiative to ask the citizens directly what their thought and opinions are...
I also appreciate the link!

I'm thinking- buy into bitcoin, and wait it out. I WILL spend it, but there has to places locally I can walk into and buy stuff, everyday stuff. Gas, Food, Maybe clothes or whatever. That time, I believe, will come. When it DOES finally get here, I'll have, in essence, a very good yield on a "savings account" of sorts. 
History has shown that Fiat currencies, left to run rampant (as is the case here in america now), will ultimately fail. The US's credit ratings are getting lowered, and I'm sure the rest of the world isn't comfortable having the reserve currency as unstable as it has been in recent years. If, by chance, the IMF decides to use a pool of the worlds top currencies, averaged out, to act as the reserve currency, the dollar is going to go to shit, and quick. Why not sit on Bitcoins and have the future liquidity at the ready? It's already shown that it can function as a daily currency, if only it's infrastructure would spread.

Well, there went a pretty slide...254 in bitcointicker.co

This reminds me of something I very recently read that Senior economist François R. Velde wrote when he was describing Bitcoin in [this]( Forbes article.

This person joined 11-16-13 and this is the only post they've ever made. Just goes to show you how people are quick to get online and bitch about something, but won't go online and praise something.
Thank you for your input BBBB.

It's not risky. It's stupid. The USD, in terms of "spending power" is losing value every year. That's what inflation is. They continuously print more, debasing the current supply. In fact, I can't think of a single instance where the dollar has gotten MORE valuable. 
It seems far less risky to invest in BTC, than to invest in something that we KNOW loses value, and will continue to lose value through inflation.

Judging by his reading skills he so eloquently showed off, and is absolutely flawless logic, I'd say this guy is an expert. If not for the reasons already mentioned, there's also the fact that he's loud. 
Being loud and yelling always the best, most intelligent way to prove that you know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:07:40
Fear, worry, doubt. Panic, scared, worry, fear. Doubt. Worry. Panic.
That's all I can see in this "debate". If, instead of speculating on a myriad of "could" and "might" and "what if", you were to base your decisions on "research shows", "comparative analysis reveals", and "logically....", I think it might be more beneficial to everyone. 
However, if you insist on worry and speculation, don't bring others down with you until you can undeniably prove your assumptions are correct.

This whole article reeks of reputation stain inducing breath.
Although it points out that bitcoin IS a viable alternative to state currency- Velde's words might be construed as....off putting.

the main currency is based on an extremely complex code understood by only a few and controlled by even fewer, without accountability, arbitration, or recourse.”

Don't get me wrong- I like the fact he gives it a thumbs up, but I think he's giving it a thumbs up for the wrong reasons, while trying to give a nefarious image to those who buy in....
I guess ANY PR is good PR, though....right?

[SERIOUS] Why does it have to scan your palm? I thought this was supposed to be anonymous, using your address as your unique identifier.

Its not about helping the traditional economy, its about replacing it with something immune to central banks, fractional reserve banking, and inflation(once all 21 million coins have been mined).
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:43:34
Interesting. Thank you. 
I find it odd that governments try to keep from recognizing bitcoin as a viable alternative to their currencies by down playing it, while at the same time ensuring they benefit from it through capitol gains taxes. However, I  may not fully understand this situation.

Wouldn't it have been easier to use a heat exchanger and small pond pump? Pump the water from the Aquaponics through the heat exchanger, mounted on the output of the miner's exhaust fans, and back in to the barrel?
