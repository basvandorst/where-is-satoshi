Hey, it is here:
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:29:40
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:57:56
Oh dear, the Nazi comparison again. No different from saying babies are dying because of a failure to scale Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:31:32
I agree on Segwit2x
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:02:20
The list of accusations against me and my intentions is long.
I have a podcast, I interview people, I have been attacked for giving a platform to people. I am trying to fairly give airtime to two sides of a debate. I am trying to neutrally understand the debate.
I read the Wikipedia post, I see the comparison to the slavery argument with a middle ground. To me that compares apples with tractors. Slavery to me is wrong, no middle ground.
This is a debate about scaling technology. 
The toxicity of this means I’m damned if I do, I’m damned if I don’t and eve damned if I might. Very draining.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:33:35
Okay, no worries, if you choose to listen to the others then fine. You may also want to read what I published last night, first to release this. There is sometimes a bigger play at work:
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:36:02
I'll add that to the list of accusations. I think there are now at least 10 categories of them.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:07:38
That achievement is easy to unlock, I just don’t think it’s worth it.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:52:04
It’s not about the people. I’ve read things but Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik which I find interesting. I’m interested in the scaling arguments.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:53:33
attempts have been made, give me time
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:56:33
Just trying to consume everything from both sides. There is a considerable amount of information. It’s easy to pick a side and argue for it. To be as neutral as possible is hard.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:04:45
Just out of interest, I have also read things by Mike Hearn, Gavin Andreson and Jeff Garzik which are interesting. They also seem to be people with skin in the game. What are your thoughts on them?
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:17:14
I've always used the example of Louis Theroux, who interviews Nazis, pimps and murderers. Is he giving a platform for their nonsense? No, he is telling the story.
FYI, I am not saying I am of his standard.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:10:06
I don’t agree that comparing it to flat earthers is the same. I think neither scaling solution can prove 100% theirs will Work and have many challenges ahead.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:50:32
I can see how things could be considered a conflict of interest. I know the authenticity of what I am trying to do 
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:16:47
I just noticed I was doing that. If I can’t figure this out then how am I meant to understand how a protocol works ������
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:58:12
This is my point exactly. When I first started out I used Local Bitcoins and it was a pain, I had to create photos of me holding signs with passports numbers and other nonsense. When I created my wallets I needed to have far more technical expertise than I had and then I was in constant fear of being hacked and having them stolen.
With Coinbase it was easy to signup, register and verify identity. Buying and moving coins is easy. The vault appears to solve security issues.
They have great usability like other disruptive businesses such as AirBNB which is good for the non techies.
The only downside I have is the requirement to deposit money via the bank, this stops large quick purchases.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:59:34
This is really cool, thanks for pulling this together. I would subscribe to an email list for something like this.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:47:03
Ah okay but really you are likely in the top 100,000 or something because the coins will never be that evenly spread. I better go and buy another 1.5 bitcoins then :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:31:20
Thanks for the points and feedback. I have edited the post but I guess I can't really do anything about the comments discussing it now, so be it. I wasn't trying to be competitive though.
I get what you are saying and I have ordered a Trezor which I will migrate to when it arrives.
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:31:59
I think this post with its answers gives a better picture than using a search function and meandering through endless articles.

@_date: 2017-02-04 14:35:12
What is the 21 about, I have heard this before? I've also read about the mtgox thing and it appears that they were a pretty badly run exchange, it seems to be with Coinbase being in the US they are tied to some pretty heavy restrictions. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:16:32
But what will happen to me?

@_date: 2017-02-04 14:16:13
What does this list mean? Is it a bunch of people who have had bad experiences? Doesn't this happen with lots of companies across all different trades? 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:57:35
Well I've ordered a Trezor thing but that is coming from the US so I am using the Vault until then.
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:18:12
20.5 bitcoins to go
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:35:38
Why though? Surely they freeze for a reason and even if they did then they would have to give me my coins back right?
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:12:11
Is there any risks with Breadwallet? Also what is the max you would keep on it? What if it gets pulled from the App store and you lose your phone?
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:12:56
Thing is if I buy something for £50 from an American company and the $ changes against the £. When they refund me they still refund £50.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:54:50

hahahahaha so right :)
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:29:12
This is what I am thinking, funnily enough in the refund email they sent me their terms as I guess people question this.
With my Nano S I paid in cash. If I hadn't have bought the Trezor then I would still have the bitcoin and they would have accumulated in value.
Equally though if my bitcoin had decreased in value I wonder if I would have been annoyed.
Like I say, I am not sure how I feel. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:37:48
Good, we can forget it and grow without it.

You missed a great show with Szabo
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:30:38
True but I paid in Bitcoin, by returning by Bitcoin they would be in the same position.
They have made money and I have lost.

Okay, I am not sure how I do this to make everyone happy. lots of people don't trust what I am saying. 
Anyway, the winning coin is Komodo, I will give £100 right now to someone to try and prove I am not talking shit.
I will setup a new sub-Reddit and see what happens. I have no idea how to make everyone here gets involved, let's see what happens.

Good question man. No, I am committed to this for the year. Firstly I believe in the market and can't see it crashing to a place where I can't do it anymore. Secondly, I can easily partition actual £ to cover this. I have enough to cover myself.
I guess we will see in a year. Hopefully, I can continue beyond a year and raise it up.

Okay people think this might be fake. I tell you what, to get the ball rolling, I will post a random crypto away later today. I'll announce which coin in 3 hours. It will only go to someone who comments here and they must have had an account for over a month.
I dunno, give me other ideas to prove the legitimacy if you want. I have nothing to hide.

Yeah, totally down to them really but cheers for looking into it.

I'll write down each username, find a website where I can do a random selection and then announce the winner.
Unless someone had a better idea.

Sorry man, I have transferred the Komodo to and waiting for him/her to confirm they have received it. The Komodo Block Explorer appears to be down so I can't post the transaction yet.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:52:56
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:37:38
Yeah, I like Coinbase. I know others don't but if you are patient with customer support and getting your account up then it is a really user-friendly place.
If you get serious with Crypto then I highly recommend a hardware wallet like a Nano S.

I don't share my security because I am happy to ave a public profile. But I keep my hardware wallets in a random and secure location and the hold the majorly of my coins.
For smaller coins I use either a desktop wallet or Coinomi.
For some I keep on exchanges but only small amounts.
I'm a long term holder who rebalances his portfolio, I believe in the tech and market long term so I don't worry if I miss a market cycle.

I had my own company, sold it, pumped a load into Crypto in January. If you had Ethereum, Digibyte, Ripple, Antshares, Bitshares and sold at the right time then you definitely made a shit ton of money.
I've two years freedom ahead. Now it is time to see if I can make this a lifetime.
People do it with shares, Crypto volatility is a traders dream.
I'm finding out if I am good or just lucky.

Sometimes you get the feel for how an interview should go during it. I’d also read some things about how Pieter just wants to write code...
@_date: 2019-08-07 09:00:37
Yep, it’s on my to do list, I’m on holiday though so need to find some time.
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:55:48
Nice one, thanks for your kind words.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:29:06
So kind, cheers dude
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:33:29
Apologies. I am not trying to spam the SubReddit and only post my most important interviews.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:10:02
Of course, I’m not even sure why I said that. Thanks Bryan.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:47:09
Potentially but it is out of the timeline now. I am not sure how much value there is to this.

He did a newbie show with Stephan
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:48:01
I didn't think there was enough in this. Really one main question around why he did the statement, which I am not sure you would get the truth about anyway.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:48:24
No, more than that
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:32:59
Me too
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:40:48
Which is why I didn't debate him :)

Maybe if you are Bitcoin bipolar Cobra

A BCash shill, how fucking dumb are you?
@_date: 2019-04-27 21:05:00
Apologies if this annoyed anyone. Yes I’m not technical, yes I maybe don’t know the history as much as others etc...
I think there are more people like this than people realise. My show really doesn’t reflect my thoughts, it tends to reflect the listeners I talk to and the interviews I do.
The download numbers would imply that there are people who like the show and the DMs and emails I get suggest most are new people struggling to understand the space.
I’m sorry if you think I’m a fucking idiot but I am doing this from an honest position. I might misstep at times but it’s a process.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:05:19
Would love to and working on getting access.

There is no real incentive other than ask questions and find answers. I could have a very easy and comfortable life asking Bitcoiners safe questions.
It feels to me, and just to me, that I think it is a bit more nuanced than you said. 
I think that there are people who believe that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash, blah blah blah. I don’t agree with them but they do. I feel that they want to do this by scaling on chain. I also feel there are “some” who wanted to do that and takeover Bitcoin but I don’t believe it was just an excuse to attack. 
I think different people have different incentives and reasons and some feel that Bitcoin has ideologically changed.
I’m a pretty honest and transparent person. My podcast reflects questions I have and things I have not found clear answers too. Sadly this pisses people off regularly.
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:17:56
I think it might be that some of the topics I am wrestling with resonate with listeners. There are other podcasts which are better suited for people who have already been through this.
I'm not sure figuring stuff out makes you stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:30:10
Transcripts are provided by [rev.com]( I do skim read them to check that everything is okay but sometimes there may be mistakes. There is a disclaimer with each transcript which highlights this. 
Of course I don't intentionally misquote people, only an idiot would do that.
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:28:36
Last two episodes have got them, take a look. I do need to do the old archive now :(
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:28:06
My experience of over debating with a guest doesn't make for a solid interview. My job is not to convince them, my job is to bring new thoughts and ideas that we haven't heard. Too much debate might detract from getting the guest to deliver their points.
@_date: 2018-11-30 13:28:15
Okay cool, thanks, feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:20:28
Thanks, I used to do those but they take a long time - I might bring them back, thank you for the suggestion.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:38:51
The someone can create a better cryptocurrency is totally flawed. Shows they do not understand proof of work and what it means for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:29:09
Thanks, not sure if it is okay to share your own content here but it did well on Medium so I thought I would try and increase the reach.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:52:34
Sorry but the argument that the banks could buy it to destroy it is completely flawed. Only around 1m are actively available to trade in any day, if they tried to buy all them then all they would do is push up the price of BTC for holders.
Cash, computers, mobile phones, cars and all kinds of things are used for drugs. You would be a fool to use Bitcoin as it is completely traceable.
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:41:54
They make money on both, every income stream contributes to the bottom line
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:32:37
No worries dude, we all have an opinion which is cool. The high fees were arguably an attack, though technically I am slightly out of my depth. This is where the memepool was flooded right?
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:53:37

I’m definitely not going to try and debate somebody who starts a sentence with “the you are ignorant.”
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:08:10
Apologies, this is my article that someone has shared. I am not here for an argument. I am not anti-Bitcoin, I hold and love Bitcoin.
Just a couple of things I want to pick up on though:
* Would you not say that "-Instant transactions? -un-confiscatable? -un-forgeable?" are features rather than utility?
* I agree we are within the baby steps, all I want to do is avoid a bubble bursting and if retail adoption is paced way behind utility we do run the risk of the bubble bursting.
* Bumps in the road I agree, my concern is that it is in the interest of some parties to keep transaction fees high.
I do like it, I am just debating things from my side which I see as a concern. It is definitely not a shit article though. I spent two days writing it and researching in depth. I'll accept a debate but I won't accept it being called a shit article because you disagree.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:09:01
Do you need to be a 'somebody' to have an opinion? I don't understand why there has to be such defensiveness. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:40:32
For now they are!
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:43:02
There is still more news to come.
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:12:03
No, you can't but you can spend money easily. I think people are missing the point here, I am saying it can beat the best quality of both.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:26:01
I agree with Roger on the point he is making though I want to also be clear that I am No2x, Small block off chain scaling fan.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:55:07
Hi Mark, I will be in Japan at the end of the month, would you do an interview for my podcast, What Bitcoin Did? It would be good to explore this together.
Previous guests include Charlie Lee, Jameson Lopp and most recently Lyn Ulbricht, mother of Ross Ulbricht.
Apologies if this isn't the best way to reach out and hijacking the AMA, I have tried Twitter.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:46:53
We all get burned a few times, I did on tech stocks a couple of years ago and learned some painful lessons. The crypto market is very similar to me, just more exaggerated.
Those who got burned will the potential and get back in.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:57:11
Hence why it is possible to manipulate the market.

I really like that big number you just wrote ^^
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:56:45
Really? Isn't it the case that the price is set by what people are willing to sell at too?

I agree with the comma but why the capital M?
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:10:31
If we are in a bubble it is the early stages and will go much higher before it pops. Bubbles are usually ridiculous. We're only $600 above the bubble burst of 2013. 
Come back when we're over $5k and then it might pop.
Prices are moving fast but we're no way near in bubble territory.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:30:39
Actually it took around 4 years 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:25:59
But it might go down, then up, then down, then up
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:22:25
That sound sensible then.

An AMA would be good too
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:49:30
I am just saying you can't guarantee that is the reason. There are lots of other things going on a the moment which are affecting the market too. I think is a combination of factors.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:38:52

It could clearly hit any random number in the next random period of time.
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:19:00
I've a feeling that they might rally prior to August 1st. Every other coin which has activated Segwit appears to have done so successfully and this has led to a price rally. One way or another Segwit will be activated, split or no split.
As confidence over Segwit activation occurs the price will rally.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:29:12
What is Bip91?
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:47:28
If Bip91 locks in then what is the point of Bip148, aren't they trying to achieve the same thing

You can't guarantee the prices are dropping because of scaling. The prices went up when there were scaling issues.
