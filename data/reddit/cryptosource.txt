The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has stated in an email that gains from transactions in Bitcoin will be taxed as Income Tax, for companies and individuals based in Singapore. It was also mentioned that if the Bitcoins were held as a long-term investment, then capital gain profits will not be taxed. Also, all transactions where Bitcoins are used as payment for physical money, services, and goods will be taxed if both parties involved are in Singapore.

Haha, touche. However, it is still more profitable now to mine Altcoins and convert back to BTC. There is definitely room for altcoins in the crypto world.

Bitcoin is very interesting to many people, however, many people get scared off when they start investigating how to purchase Bitcoin. Many people are uncomfortable with verifying their identities or linking their bank accounts with the various Bitcoin purchasing services. People don’t like waiting 4-5 business days for their transactions to be processed. Then, a wonderful service like QuickBT comes around and changes everything.
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:54:13
It already exists. Bitcoin 2.0 is a scrypt based coin with the same parameters as Bitcoin. Check Bitcointalk altcoin forums. haha...
But seriously, Bitcoin has the following right now, so it would take a lot to knock it down. However, it's not impossible. The biggest flaw is the long confirmation times, making it unfeasible for direct exchange (say at a grocery store, the lineups would be crazy with everyone having to wait 6 minutes for payment confirmation).
IMO, I currently like Digitalcoin. Transactions are confirmed almost instantly. Litecoin is currently the next contender simply due to the following. It would take a lot of work/investment/community support from any other alt coin though to truly rival Bitcoin. The most plausible scenario is that Google, Facebook or Amazon launch a coin and invest millions. If one of those giants implement their own crypto (properly), it's game over for Bitcoin. Simply because of the advertising power they'd have.

Wow! We didn’t see this one coming. Today, mcxNOW users were greeted with a message stating the popular exchange would be shutting down for “a while”.  Users will have up until December 20th to withdraw their funds. We have no words… this is definitely a shocker and we feel terrible for whoever shelled out some hard earned money to purchase mcxFee shares. This announcement was made just a few weeks after the exchange had earned over $1 Million in fee sales. The reasons given were that only a single person was running the site and that the work load had become too much for this person to handle. You would think that with a million dollars in your pocket, you could afford to hire an extra pair of hands or two. We are not sure what to make of this move… we just hope that the exchange does in fact return as planned, but this move has so many red flags written all over it. Best of luck to those affected.

That would be even cooler! I'm sure it's the next step. There are already Bitcoin ATM's being deployed around the world as we speak... though they will work with QR codes instead of a debit card.

Actually, this will likely affect Litecoin much more than it will Bitcoin. SilkRoad is still going strong... and even then, Bitcoin has many legitimate businesses now accepting it. It will be very hard to take down now.

The recent rise of Bitcoin has caused the alt market to go into a steady decline. The price of many alt coins have more than halved in the last week causing some turmoil and uncertainty in the field. It’s not like we haven’t seen this before though. Bitcoin rises, alt coins drop. This causes a domino effect where people see their investments crashing and everyone starts to panic sell their precious alt coins, which in turn causes more panic. The other reason people are selling their alts is because people want to hop onto the Bitcoin gravy train and reap the rewards of this incredible rise.

Well, Litecoin was the first true innovative competitor to Bitcoin. Using a different algorithm and faster transaction times. Say what you wish, but Litecoin changed the way we currently mine coins. Bitcoin are being dominated by ASICs while Litecoin is currently immune and give people with GPU's a chance. Totally different coins...
@_date: 2013-09-08 19:36:12
Sure, the mark up may be higher than most places, but how many places offer instant access to Bitcoin at the moment? You literally have access to your purchased coins minutes after you buy. I can't find anywhere else that offers this other than Coinbase.

It seems like every day a new alt coin is released to the public. Many of these are nothing more than a simple clone of Bitcoin or Litecoin, offering nothing new other than revised block times or difficulty retargetting algorithms. The crypto coin world hasn’t seen anything really innovative in quite some time. However, there are a few projects out there that are planning to revolutionize the way we look a virtual currencies. This is a testament to all the great ideas and wonderful people in the alt community. People are always willing to bring things to the next level. The following is a list of 5 currencies currently in development that are all significantly different from their counterparts and truly set themselves in a pack of their own.

Bitcoin has a massive following right now. They also have a ridiculous amount of support and services and established businesses already accepting it, so it would take a lot to knock it down. However, it’s not impossible. Bitcoin’s biggest flaw right now is the long confirmation times, making it unfeasible for direct commercial exchange in a practical setting (say at a grocery store). The lineups would be crazy with everyone having to wait 6 minutes for payment confirmation). Many coins out there have much faster confirmation times and would seem to be much more practical in a typical commercial setting. Coins like Litecoin and Digitalcoin are much faster. Litecoin confirming in just over 2 minutes and Digitalcoin confirming in about 1 minute. What do you think? Is it possible?

Also, for information on wallets or just getting started in crypto, you can start here: 
For your question, I suggest Coinbase. It acts as a wallet and a purchasing service all in one, so you only have to sign up for one thing. Though we recommend you do your research thoroughly before making any decisions.

It's more of a precaution. We don't really want to be associated in promoting the deep web.

If people really want to know, they'll find a way ;)

Latest Announcement from SR:
Atlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go. Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well. They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay  we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty.
There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well. Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming. What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life. I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another.
I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause. I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter. If you haven't read it yet, please do. Here is the link:
The bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart. I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here.
Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don't have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain. And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site. Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms :)
Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able.

Bitcoin and Crypto-Currencies have long been associated with a much shadier side of the internet than many of us would like. Many of these black market websites are almost a clone of Amazon, except users can purchase illicit products such as drugs and fake id’s from the comfort of their living rooms.  These sites are mostly accessible via secure anonymous browsing on the Tor network. The most popular of these sites being The Silk Road.
CryptoSource tries to stay away from announcing news from such illegal sites, however, we cannot ignore the importance these sites had on the market price and stability of Bitcoin. Regardless of how any of you feel about these websites, Bitcoin enthusiasts need to recognize that these underground sites are a huge reason that Bitcoin was able to accumulate real monetary value. Without these sites and the increase in value, Bitcoin would have been much less desirable for legit business to start accepting them.
@_date: 2013-09-07 15:53:42

This was much more the case in the earlier days of Bitcoin. The article suggests that shutting down these sites today won't have much of an impact, if any, due to the fact that so many legit businesses are now supporting it.
While I agree about decriminalizing drugs as it would most likely lower crime rate and allocate funds for actual police work. This was not the point of the article.

In the interest of releasing this to the public quickly, we are proud to announce our Beta launch of Debit Cards that will work with ATM or POS (Point of Sale) terminals in Canada and even some internationally! For faster withdrawals you can now sell Bitcoins for CAD and then take out the cash at ATM’s! There is a one-time fee of $10 to have the card mailed to you, once you have the card there is a low administration fee of $1.50 to add funds to the card. You must have VirtEx CAD to withdraw to this card and you must be cash or online verified but no bank account is required. Loads are performed once per business day at 5 p.m. MST.
The first step is to make sure your contact information has your correct address, this is where your card will be mailed by regular mail, next go to Withdraw CAD and choose an amount to withdraw. A debit card (with PIN) will then be mailed to you but the amount will not be loaded until you have confirmed receipt of the card by submitting a ticket under the new category: “Prepaid Debit.” You will then receive a confirmation email when your first amount is loaded. More details will follow with the release of a full fee schedule for card use shortly. When Beta ends in approximately 1-2 months we will enable live 24/7 loading of these cards the moment you press withdraw CAD! We will also allow for Canada Post Xpresspost rush card delivery shortly!

These articles are submitted via our Earn &amp; Be Heard program where users can submit opinion pieces and earn some Bitcoin for doing so. 
I believe this article isn't about the protocol itself, but raises a question on what happens if certain companies hold too much power. If for instance, in the future, Bitstamp is the go to place for Bitcoin, all the US gov would have to do is shut one site down and the Bitcoin economy could be in turmoil.
Bitcoin in itself will never be centralized. However, if certain services get large enough, it may feel like it is.
