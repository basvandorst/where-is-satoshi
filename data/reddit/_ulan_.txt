Then after a few rounds : 
"Okay now I really feel like selling, so this mean it's gunna go up right ? Let's buy more.
Arrgh it's crashing, cauz I actually should have listened to the deeper me. Let's buy more.
Me ? An addict ? No, look I made the right decisions and just broke even ! Let's buy more."

There was not "evil plan" that is just how market goes,  waves of hype come and go.
If there was one evil plan, it was from those who made the hype in the first place

You don't betray anyone, you just put value where you think it is best. Betraying would mean that you have emotions, and the first rule when dealing with money is to not behave on emotions.
If loosing 14% is painful, you are doing it wrong.

No. It does have an environmental effect, even in Iceland. Geothermal has its own problems, and has been widely advertised as entirely green ... I guess its like nuclear energy, it doesn't "pollute" in the usual way. And warming the air by consuming that much electricity has an impact as well.

Countries like China don't fear crypto, in all its worth it is a great technology an has a promising future. Every time an unregulated tech emerges (same for Internet) they have to deal with all sorts of groups complaining about being scammed, loosing their business, their capital, etc. They are still supposed to write law for their citizens (the richest ones, often)  so eventually they have to forbid, tighten the regulations.
Also , all countries will not fear loosing their economical power. Most of subsaharian Africa still use the French African Franck which is still printed in France. It's been good for them so far as printing it in the country could have led to issues, but they are not against loosing a power they did not have in the first place. Same for countries basing their currency on the dollar.

You're not wrong. Yet the "clean" millionaires are either like-minded to the criminals, or they are the best customers on the silk road. I usually would rather not advocate for the cholera even if the pest is worse, which is what OP is indirectly doing by saying a bad person is worst than a less bad person. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:52:44
A good benefit from DCA is to remove the emotion from the decision. So if you come every day to buy the dip, It seems to me that it is worse than buying all at once. IMHO, I prefer to automate the operation.

I don't think you should regard them as crappy dirty dealers. Most of those shady people needed to learn about darknets, privacy, go through scams, phishings, hacking attempts... Although that doesn't make you a good person, it does at least require you to have a half working brain.
If you compare that to the money-hungry guys working in the trading pits in the 90s, I'd rather have the geeky drug sellers.
These guys stayed in remote places to produce what they needed to sell, and basically ran an amazon delivery service all day. They might be rich, or they might have converted all in fiat but at the end they are just producer of some consumer product, in high demand.

You only loose money if you sell your bitcoin for $$ . Else you are just seeing a theoretical price. No loss.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:38:12
I think a lot of people are getting bugged by this airplane mode stuff in your question. 
Yes, you can profit from buying low and selling high.
No, you don't need a desktop wallet or anything else than the exchange platform to do that. You have 1 btc, it won't move until you give it away. You don't need to put your dollars in a safe to make it worth more.
Some services let you store bitcoin while getting interest. Like a bank, they play with your coins and give you a share of the profit. That is as near from the " airplane mode " as you can be.

That makes more sense haha, you might want to specify that in your main post, it ll save you from bad karma :)

Suspect of ?
If you mean that he uses his reputation to catch investments in a non-stable technology, then that would be only possible if the code wasn't open-sourced. In the case of etherum, he might have tricked investors in spending money on something that was unsafe... But so was bitcoin in its initial days.
We are all a bit jealous of those who invested 1000$ in bitcoins in 2011. But back in the days, did you think they were geniuses ? Or scammed investors who trust the words of a bunch of anonymous geeks ?
With time, we will see which one had the best strategy
Edit: too many words words
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:08:36
Oh, I see what you mean :) 
So what you are describing in what they call HODL. Buy regularly, don't look at the price. (And then you can use a few extra coins for playing around)
What peopleare surprised at, when they read you question is that it sounds like "why don't we put a few euros in my safe at home and put them back in my purse on the morning". Wherever the coins are, they are yours and they don't gain or loose value. So the answer to your question is to put them wherever you fancy, juste remember that : 
1. The real value is when you hit "sell"
2. each transaction comes with a fee, so playing around wallets is not a cheap game

Eeee .... Who knows ? I didn't do the maths
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:09:06
It's the whole point of trading, desktop or not desktop. You buy, and when it suits you , you sell.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:49:17
Let's ignore bitcoin and imagine you were trading Euros / Dollars : you buy 100€ with 100$ at noon. At 9pm, your 100€ now worth 500$, what a great gain! But you live in U.S. so these euros are useless until you sell them back.
If you sell them at 9pm, you will pocket 500$ and make real gain, but if you fall asleep and wake up on the next morning where 100€ now worth 90$, well you better avoid selling it because you ll make a loss. Wait until it's back up.
Same for bitcoin, you can put them on your exchange, wallet, desktop, rapberrypi anywhere, the only time you actually make it worth is when you press the 'sell' button, the rest is hypothetical.

Eeeeh ... In my humble opinion, all solutions are solutions and their integrity is equal. However, I am pessimistic about the human decisions involved and somehow not sure if that this is the end of the issue or the start. Hopefully it will look like the issue is solved, so that people start buying again ;)
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:25:26
- if the update succeeds - and it works , and no thing else bad happens then yes it will go up. If not enough people follow, I guess it ll continue to decrease.

The whole bitcoin blockchain is having a scaling issue. The current amount of transaction generated in 10mn is too much to squeeze in one block. This could be solved various ways, but instead the community and developers preferred to argue for the last 4 years about how to improve on this issue. 
It has been decided that a solution will be effective by the 1 st of august. Naturally, investors would rather wait a few weeks than blindly buy.

Because no one can take your bitcoins away. You might not value the safety of bitcoins, but a Venezuelan would love to have some bitcoin instead of his local money.
With all the laws that protect your credit union, if your country economy collapses or if you were to go to war, those fund could be re purposed and you would not see them back. This mathematically can't happen on a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:09:45
This is the idea. I don't know what you include in crypto theft, but a tribunal or a policeman cannot knock at you door with a letter saying your coins are seized. This means a lot if you are not certain about the stability of your justice department.
Scams, hacks are a different issue : clever vs not clever.  But there is nothing one can do about that.
Edit: and to fully answer your question: only a full majority of miners could possibily censor your coins, yet can't steal them. Because science :)

Hey , the ransomware encrypted your computer, but might not know about the wallet inside !
Just make another wallet, buy bitcoin separately and pay, if the ransom-ware actually free your machine you will get your "work files " aka wallet back. Depending on your wallet software, the wallet file itself is not stored raw on your drive and the ransomware might not have seen it :)

There has been many other corrections, and the real value is not on the graph but on how many people trust the tech and the need for it. There has clearly been some over-hype on the last months, and going back down is the best way to teach early investors like you to treat your asset carefully.
If you want to feel reassured, look away from the chart for a week and look at some company stock like Samsung over the last years. They have seen some nasty correction when their product failed on their government did some mistakes, but the clever investors were the one who believed in the company and did not bail out.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:56:50
There's no win if you don't get some kind of insight, just luck. Thinking you can magically get to "choose" an asset that will surely grow is a first mistake. The game is rigged and unfair. It only is enjoyable by those who love the technology behind it, know other enthusiasts, and ultimately get into the word-of-mouth network.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:08:23
I don't see the issue with using transaction a a communication mean. However It is an issue that the current implementation cannot hold 6 billions users, and that after 4 years of scaling talks, nothing has improved :/
