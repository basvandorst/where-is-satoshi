Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 
But I think BitGo has a good point, if they got hacked, other clients would be affected.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:18:26
Once the attacker has the keys (2 out of 3 in this case), you can't stop him. That's the nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:25:29
Either he did, or had one key and got access to the signing system.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:26:40
But out of all BitGo's customers only Bitfinex got affected. Doesn't that (nearly) exclude them as the source of the hack?

SegWit2X was a bait-and-switch project to get the not so popular Segwit through the doors. As soon as it went through, they started pushing the idea that the 2X part is not going to happen. 
The fork will happen regardless, because the opinions are split.

"geeky" is an understatement. I've been programming professionally for years, and their conversation makes little sense to me. It's full of domain-specific terminology, sounds like some cryptographic exchange protocol.

You mean the way it's been working for years?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:22:14
Why is 8mb ridiculous? Storage is cheap, including server storage. And it's getting cheaper all the time. 
It will take years for 8mb blocks to get consistently full.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:42:54
No, you almost got it. Segwit support is like 30-40%, while Segwit2X is 93%.

Even if you calculate the ratio in BTC, the ratio will remain the same.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:01:36
Like with all crypto currencies - the demand. Bitcoin users have long wanted low fees and fast confirmations, and that solved the problem.

Don't. This is not a pyramid scheme. Why do you feel like you have to sell it?

Bittrex has the most volume, doesn't require account approval.

Because until recently Javascript didn't have a good source of entropy, so you had to use the mouse. 
The standalone apps can get the entropy straight from the OS.

How is it being manipulated exactly? It's pretty useless in the modern world. Only 10% of it is used industrially. It's not a very good store of value, if it can be easily manipulated.

Ok, sorry if I insulted you.
You can create a wallet by importing from the QR code. Blockchain.info allows that, Mycelium allows that.
You can try scanning the QR code and converting it into a private key string with this:
(but I would only do it on a VM - load the website, disconnect from the internet, scan, save the private key, kill the VM instance).

Supernovas happen around once a century per galaxy. Around 30 per second in the observable universe.
Considering our galaxy is 13 billion years old, there have been hundreds of millions of supernovas in our galaxy alone.

Timings of keypresses, mouse timings/speed/position are random, because humans are just not that precise. 
Try to press the any button exactly the same way twice, within a microsecond difference (the resolution of the high precision timers). It will take you a long time. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:35:49
To whom? Other people without money?

What is your solution exactly? Where will the Greek government get all the bitcoins? With what money?
Just sit and wait for the businesses to move in? You are an idiot.
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:26:13
Bitcoin's industrial use is being money. That's what it was designed for. It's truly scarce, unlike gold. It's very easy to use, unlike gold. It can be easily used for buying things online, while gold can't. Etc, etc, etc.
Gold is yet another commodity that's one step away from becoming aluminium 2.0 (I hope you know the history of aluminium, they used to make expensive jewelry out of it).
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:59:15
Sure, if you cherry-pick the time period. In reality gold dropped from $1900 to around $1083. That's a 43% drop. In that time period bitcoin went up thousands of percent.
You see, I can play your stupid game too.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:32:56
I disagree. If they print their own money, they have no problem.
They can't print euros or bitcoins.

I'm not very familiar with Tails in particular. It's a Linux system based on Debian, so my answer would be "Yes, most likely".
If you want to be 100% sure, contact Tails devs directly.
Also keep in mind that Tails has never been security-audited, as far as I'm aware. It can easily be some NSA project.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:11:58
So you got hacked. Did you install something shady recently?
* Make backups, label them as "compromised".
* Wipe your OS / format everything
* Check for rootkits
* Reinstall OS
* Change passwords to everything sensitive - email, banks, credit cards. Make sure the passwords are long and random. Store them in Keepass. Backup your Keepass database.
* Inform your bank, paypal of the fraud
* Consider that your smartphone may be hacked as well. Backups. Factory reset.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:07:53
LOL. For $13/month you get






So with 50% off, $6.50/month, you get "unlimited" everything? I doubt they will honor that deal for longer than the bait period.
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:05:19
Doesn't matter. Unlimited it is not. Space, specifically. 
If space were unlimited, I would simply create a competitor to Dropbox, Backblaze, Crashplan - all on one server.

Is that a multisig transaction that didn't get released by all the parties?
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:09:08
Most operating systems already use the keyboard / mouse as sources. So yes, it can hurt. If you use the same source twice, it effectively reduces entropy.
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:57:07
If you don't trust your OS, you're fucked.
And yes, Mac, Windows and Linux all have entropy pools from which they generate cryptographically secure random numbers. 
Linux, for instance, does use key press timings, mouse movements, IDE timings as sources. Some flavors let you use audio and video data as sources.

You don't need thousands of generations of stars to have so many supernovas. Most stars live 1-10 billion years. A fraction of them go (and went) supernova, but because there are so damn many of them, a hundred million supernovas over billions of years is absolutely normal.

Not really solved. People don't have any money. They can't even get the money they have in their bank accounts. Where are they going to get all the bitcoins? The adoption is simply not there, not yet at least. It's slowly getting better, but definitely not as fast as you or I wish.
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:12:51
They can't use bitcoin, because they can't "print" it. They don't have the money to buy enough to run the economy. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:52:03
Who said anything about gold?
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:24:16
You don't get it. They need to run the economy *now*, not when all these hypothetical businesses come to Greece.
Their only option (besides an unlikely bailout) is to print their own money or make their own cryptocurrency, or both.
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:25:48
KB and mouse are fine as sources, they are just slow. But once you generate even 128 bits, you can use derivation functions to make more random numbers from the real ones.

Why not just pay the standard fee?
0.00001 is way below the standard

Sure, there are patterns, but there's a shit ton of randomness in that data too. Try to move the mouse cursor along a certain non-trivial path precisely with the same exact speed as you just did. I guarantee it will take you centuries.

I prefer to use popular distros, as they have more eyes on them, from both hackers and security professionals. So there's a smaller chance of an undiscovered vulnerability / backdoor. Any popular one should work - Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, openSuSe.
For serious bitcoin operations I boot from a live CD, so I know it's less likely to be infected than a system that's been running for months. I never browse the internet on it apart from downloading the bitcoin client. I use it unplugged from the internet as much as possible.

Ah, yeah, that's just some tiny island economy. Their population is 1,142 people. They are not talking about covering all of Greece, they simply don't have the gold to represent their economy.

It's actually a drop from almost $1900 that started in 2011.

That's not true. It's only prioritized by default. Miners can do whatever they want. And what they usually choose is to maximize the fees, or maximize the hashing speed.

They can be "followed", but you don't really know who they belong to. So not really "followed". If, let's say, they buy a car with these coins, all you will see is coins moving from address A to address B. There's no real way to find out who owns address B. At this point we don't even know who owns A.

Increasing the block size is not really a tradeoff. You lose a few pennies worth of storage per day, and a few pennies of additional bandwidth. 
As for the hard forks, they absolutely were, by definition. I agree that ETH hardfork was political, and I did think it would kill Ethereum, but it didn't. In fact, the opposite happened. Look where we're now. ETH is about to overtake BTC in the market cap.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:08:38
Bitcoin is doing fine only if you ignore (or are unaware of) a million complaints about the fees, about the transactions taking days, about the transactions not getting through at all. 
The blocks are full, that's a fact. It means Bitcoin network cannot process more transactions than it currently does. It means it sucks as a currency, because it creates bad user experience.
I'm fully aware of the proposed "solutions". They simply aren't solutions. SegWit, at best, doubles the bandwidth, but not really, because it doesn't solve the problem of the regular block transactions in any way. Lightning network is just another off-the-chain solution, it's not Bitcoin.
As for "lurk more and read more", I'm pretty sure I've done more of that than you, unless you played with multiple bitcoin libraries, generated private keys and addresses with code, etc.
I did lurk a lot, including this very sub, till the admins started banning anyone who disagreed with the party line.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:24:30
I'm not buying the storage argument at all
1) Storage is ridiculously cheap. An 8TB drive is $160 on Amazon. Calculate how many years it will take for the blockchain to fill that.
2) Segwit doesn't reduce the size of the information.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:04:41
I proceeded to explain why it's not a tradeoff, but that went over your head. The costs of increasing the block size are minuscule.


You mean the main metric used to assess the performance of every single (publicly traded) corporation? *Sure, fake.*
Sorry, it's clear to me you're clueless, there's no reason to continue this conversation. I won't be replying anymore.

"Voluntarily". There's no choice really, unless you want your coins to be frozen in your wallet forever.
That's why I stopped using bitcoin for small and medium size payments, it's just too expensive.

No, they aren't shitty at their primary function. They might be missing modern features, but that's about it.
Bitcoin though is shitty at its primary function.
Ethereum is doing much better, btw. I just bought a bunch, and it was a pleasure watching the money flow. Fast, cheap.
Don't forget, Bitcoin hard-forked a [couple of times]( in its early days, and it only made it stronger, so it's a really dumb argument.
