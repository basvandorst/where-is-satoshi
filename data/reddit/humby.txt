Well look how long it's taken for a 4 character password

I was lucky enough to be there and I'd say I agreed with 90% of what you said.
As far as 21 million cap, I think moving the decimal place (bit / uBTC) solves this. Also bitcoin will be inflationary for our lifetime.

Yeah he's been asking me to set up a page for him. You can contact him on the site if your interested.

Awesome. My brothers artwork is on this site too :)

Keep learning about Bitcoin and your question will answer itself

Federal income tax, State income tax, sales tax, capital gains tax, death tax, inflation, fees, tolls, licensing, permits, parking tickets etc etc. I'm getting mad just thinking about it

Chill out dude. Life is a marathon not a sprint. If you can keep it cool on the downs you'll hit the high of the highs. Life is full of surprises.

If he cant inflate, manipulate or tax it, I doubt he cares.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:18:54
right on! right on! thanks!

It sounds like you dont listen to Rush's show very often. For one, He almost never has guest on his show. He does take calls on fridays but he very rarely cuts off people he doesn't agree with. You may not like him but what you are saying here is not true.

Bitcoin marks the spot! Congrats!

Installed. Some initial thoughts... the address bar behavior is a bit confusing. If I want to visit a site I have to click the + Thats fine, just took me a min to realize I wasn't in an 'app' and in a browser. Maybe an arrow/guide would help people understand how it works. Also I liked the confirmation click on reordering app icons. 
Edit: Confirmation email looks weird on my iphone5 (ios7)

As long as it makes the price go up I dont really give a shit :)

My bad, i hope Im not coming off as an ungrateful jerk. I would have done it for free :) I always try and give startups honest feedback so they can improve. Thanks

I showed my family square a couple years back and some of them use it today. Getting a wallet setup on their phone and sending them some millibits is pretty easy to understand.

The excitement I felt when discovering the early Internet has only been matched by Bitcoin.

You're right.

The best roller coaster I've ever been on!

In any other money system a transaction like this would be unknown to all of us, let alone in real time. Bitcoin is amazing!
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:22:13
I think this is a werid question to ask. It's like asking if its to late to get in on the Internet because information is already on the Internet? If Bitcoin is mildly successful, long term, the flow of money will be unlike anything we have ever seen. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:35:00
The shift to bitcoin will require a long term view.
