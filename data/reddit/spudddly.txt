What is this splitting actually good for?

Yup and it's noobs that have inflated this bubble to ridiculous proportions and noobs (as always) that'll lose their shirts. Any real investor knew, and repeatedly warned, that there was absolutely nothing fundamental supporting the price and that it would inevitably crash hard. A huge bunch of complete amateurs decided they knew better and most got burned, and it's going to get a lot worse.
My guess is that the price will drop to $10's-$100's over the next year or two, stabilize enough that it will actually find some users instead of just speculators, and then struggle on for a few more years before being replaced by something much better fit for task.

more awesome advice from a technical trader:




lol how are those gartley 222 patterns and tall rejection tails working out for you?
personally I favour the reverse teacup with descending dodecahedron, but only if the date contains a prime number, ofc.

You can't seriously believe with the amount of worldwide coverage Bitcoin has had over the last few months still think there are a significant number of people who have never heard of it and will be willing to invest in future. Even if there were, they would see the crash in price over the last couple of months and never want to go anywhere near it. Bitcoin has peaked, and many ignorant amateur investors have/will get wiped out.

lol the confidence only an amateur investor can have.

I think this is very likely accurate - at least one more pump and dump effort will be made by institutional investors once the price stabilzes in the hundreds. They'll hope to will catch the few million amateur investors that came late this time and even after the crash regret not buying in when it was &lt;$1000. They might even bid the price up to &gt;$10k again at which point the whales will crash the price again.
