@_date: 2017-12-01 19:34:11
Yeah I got POWR at $.44, sold at $.80, and then rebought at $.58.  Not a lot of shares but it is an interesting coin and not based on nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:00:46
A business closing its doors and the US economy closing its doors is *not* the same.  If BTC collapsed down to $100 or less because something disrupted it very suddenly, would that be a significant problem for a lot of people? Not that many right?  
I'm not saying this can't or shouldn't replace traditional currency.  I'm saying I want the transition to be peaceful and good for most people, not just us brave investors. 
I don't know about you but of my large family only a couple members have listened to me and taken any stake in this.  If it moons that's good.  If it moons and destroys the dollar that's bad.  Most of my friends haven't invested, and most people I talk to range from no knowledge at all thus not investors to shaky knowledge at best and thus not investors.  This progress has to go slowly or it will do more damage than good. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:59:49
Thank you. I am diversified with btc, ltc, xmr, xrp, and a small amount of powr. I know xrp amd powr are considered shitcoins right now but they had excellent PoW concepts so i got on. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:54:27

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:55:26
The plow of progress does not care about the dirt underneath us.  If this is a revolution of money like a lot of people believe it to be that is good but only so long as it doesn't just collapse currencies that are older than it, at least on a fast progression scale.  Then early adopters and the rich that can afford the investment of BTC are the new rich and the now richer whilst the others whom have nothing to invest are at best the same or likely worse off.  Furthermore if Kodak closing its doors is bad for thousands, US dollar is bad for millions and possibly billions. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:32:34
A lot of innocent people get hurt in a shift like that. The collapse in the 2000s left my mom a lot worse off and she never fully recovered. It is easy to say something like that without understanding the ramifications that come with it

Because you know... everybody has money to invest or the knowledge of this from years ago.  I get it that its not our responsibility to anyone, but I think OP is talking about things like schools.  I donate my time at underprivileged middle and high schools.  Most of those kids are just like any other but with a harder background or just having the odds stacked against them.  Lets be good to our fellow humans and make the world a better place to live for anyone... not just us.

The Trezor gives a warning message if its been tampered or altered.  I feel completely safe with my third party purchase.  I basically had to stab the box open too.  No way in hell somebody opened it and put it back. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:14:54
I wish something like this was stickied.  It took me quite a while to get to something this clear and concise. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:14:11
If my Trezor has been tampered with such that it is compromised and my wallet gets stolen I will give you my remaining assets on coinbase and abandon crypto for fiat and live my schmuck life.  I read through all of the information about why it can not be compromised on Trezor's on site so if I am one of the poor bastards that owns a thing that proves them wrong then the least I can do is send it in to them after it happens so they can learn what to fix.

Good to know!  I am still learning more every day myself.  I guess I am thinking more about the company advertising it rather than the end user figuring out a way. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:06:54
HODLers are absolutely the reason why BTC price is increasing.  I think you have it backwards my friend. The supply is not *really* going up because hodlers refuse to release their clutches on their coins.  I do agree that spending it and gaining infrastructure to support its widespread use is important but I have no doubt that hodlers are the reason for the pricing season.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:47:04
I would only keep at most 10% of any asset on coinbase.  I migrate whenever I buy to a hardware wallet.  Yes, there is a fee, and no I don't think $2 will be relevant in 5 years time to me.

I have a decent sized amount waiting in the wings for a drop like that. Otherwise its average cost model for me  
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:56:38
I think the idea being that governments and private interests control a much larger supply in the world than individuals, but I have only heard this and I have no research on the topic to verify that claim that was made.

@_date: 2017-11-20 20:44:18
Yeah its definitely not a good long term strategy. There has to be more implementation but thats why instead of telling retailers i shop at that i want them to accept bitcoin i tell them i want them to give me btc as change. They look at me like a moon man. I hope in 5 years i am. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:46:21
I dont think i am being clear enough. Bitcoins price is because of hokders not releasing any supply at this point AND because the amount of real worl application is increasing, but people not wanting to release their coins is  pushing our supply and demand curves over by at least an order of magnitude. Nobody wants to buy a pizza with a fortune anymore unless they are already holding a significant stack of btc. If we see a drop in the next year it will be because a lot of panicked holders sell out of fear all of a sudden. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:13:01
Thanks for the response.  I dont believe the BCH hype. Someone from there told me that businesses were moving from btc to bch and i asked which businesses so i could be more informed. They called me a fool and that was all i needed to know they were full of shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:30:06
No. A lot of this whole system is predicated on some amount of trust and as the community grows so too does our collective trust so long as we dont perversely change it. Could the 1 mil btc in Satoshi's wallet suddenly move one day?  Sure. Could enough mining power in china corener the market. Yes. Could a powerful government buy until they have enough to attempt to control the market? Yes. These are all possibilitoes but they are possibikities for gold stores, fiat, companies, everything. No risk, no reward. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:01:15
Having rules for investing is a good thing.  It helps you make calm decisions even when shit seems like its on fire rather than letting emotion rule you. Even though I am a newer player to crypto it doesn't change the fact that the rules are the same IMO.
My 10% rule:
Keeping an eye on the news and what's going on is a good thing.  When Bcash peeps were pumping their coin I sold my 10% bitcoin and bought again at 6k. 1.7 per and even at 10% its not nothing.  Also with just 10% of the asset I am not betting the farm so if I *do* fuck up I am not fucked.  
Also, once it hits my hardware wallet it stays there permanently. Period.  Even if the price is going down. Even if I want to for some reason. I pretend its a one-way flow of money just like my IRAs. 
Finally I do try to make purchases with my LTC and BTC, especially if I see that a new vendor is accepting cryptos I want them feeling rewarded for doing so.  I know people disagree with needing cryptos to be mass accepted as money for it to continue its moon journey but I don't care.  The more infrastructure that supports this the more likely we increase its anti-fragility and decrease its volatility. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:33:56
Yes. When governments were using gold or silver to back their currency it was very common to secure large stores. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:02:01
I'd like to talk with some of them.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:24:55
I agree that if nobody wanted to use BTC for purchases it would not have its price.  I also see that we have a shifting S/D curve which means that if hodlers were not hodling we would have a lot more supply of coins on the market leading to lower prices.  Of course this is more complicated than a single factor but hodling is most certainly a huge driving force for price just due to the demand shift we see. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:48:05
I always add a caveat when i tell friends and family that they should decide for themselves. I tell them pros cons and say now i want you to make a glod decision
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:33:07
When i got back in to crypto very recently i was confused as all bell about why r/bitcoin and r/btc were so different. I didnt have a fucking clue what bcash was beyond a fork i knew nothing about. A completely new person hops on r/btc and asks where to buy bitcoin and what do you think those fuck nuggets are going to say?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:08:58
You probably wont have time to do that
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:18:53
Global economy of scale, way to transport vast sums of money with lower risk of theft or loss and decreased size, easier to move in quantity than precious metals or jewels, and i am expecting that eventually more and more vendors get on board with it. What do you think happens if tomorrow amazon says it accepts bitcoin now? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:22:02
Married guy of 14 years here with a wall of text for you:
1. You have an amazing potential to diversify your portfolio.  You should do that.  Just 2 bitcoins could start an IRA for you and your wife in a more stable market with longer term outcomes you can't (read "shouldn't") touch.  As bitcoin grows you can keep siphoning off in to those IRAs for years just off the growth of the coin without investing a dime of income and at the end of 20-25 years likely have both lots of bitcoin still and lots of US dollars that would lead to a comfortable retirement.  Even if bitcoin tanks just this one diversification if done for the next 10 years puts $110,000 in IRAs which is better than a lot of people can do or know to do and they are super safe. 
2. Compound interest works for you or against you... always.  While nobody knows what will happen with BTC, a mortgage will always suck.  If you have the capitol to buy a house in cash you should do that.  Houses can plummet in value but a lot less likely as well.  Another diversification point as well in the equity of your house.  Now you have 3 in your portfolio. I made decent money with the stock market in college but I felt more like a gambler than a smart guy so I quit that.  When I got married I married my wife's debt. I paid off all her loans even though it made her nervous.  She liked having the nest egg because seeing a chunk of money feels good.  We don't owe money on a car, a credit card, all debt free except for house and I would pay that shit off immediately if I could.  Even so I put a good amount in to the house.  Wife and I could both lose our jobs tomorrow and be fine for 1 year without any income before we would face a problem.  Not many people have that freedom.
3. While your wife could divorce you and take half your stuff that is not a concern unless it is.  Let me explain. Look at the following equations and tell me where you fall:
* 1 of 2 BTC &gt; wife
* 1 of 2 BTC &lt; wife
* 1 of 2 BTC = wife
If you are the first equation don't tell your wife, but do work on your relationship.  Money matters can destroy trust no matter what type they are.  What are you going to tell her 10 years later if you kept all this secret?  What if she resents you for being afraid of financial problems when you had answers.  They are the same what ifs as if you tell her and everything is awesome or she takes off, or quits.  Only you have (or should have) insight on your marriage and partner and you need to trust some instinct.  If you are afraid that she would split with your cash though if you got wealthy then may I ask without insult how you will EVER answer questions about where the money is coming from?  Also she isn't entitled to all your stuff so if you lost half would you not still be in a favorable position? 
If it were me I would tell my wife and already have a gameplan to present her about what to do with this. To you this was a wise investment you saw grow in time.  To her this will be a windfall and people do stupid stuff with windfalls if they don't have a plan.  Good luck, make smart decisions, and don't fuck with suspicious women.

I am buying nothing on black friday.  Most of the time shit's a scam and you can find the same deal (or better!) any other day of the year.  Furthermore I am giving out LTC and BTC paper wallets to friends and family who don't know about crypto yet this year for Christmas.  Fuck consumerism. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:10:22
25k in to BTC, 5k in to ethereum and LTC, maybe splurge 1k on something interesting like POWR, 5,500 in to Vanguard IRA, get a nice dinner, and pay off or down any serious debts you have.  Crypto is a volatile and risky space still but if you owe money that is guaranteed to be whatever percentage being taken out of your ass at all times. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:41:54
Its hard to predict a volatile market.  I tend to stick to the ACH method.  If I believe that all times are good to buy right now but don't want to consistently hit ATH I buy amounts over time.  If it dips down then great! I will buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:15:53
By buying bitcoin we are investing in it as a commodity that has the backing of the underlying technology and the fact that it has branding while moving mainstream.  That is not a blind gamble.  Investing now is more like looking at winners at a particular wheel that is not perfectly random, seeing that 99/100 times the wheel lands on red and picking red. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:25:30
I agree. Being a new player it feels more like a bunch of childs play with real money.   We should be treating this with more respect and getting people to see it for what it is: a truly futuristic and transformative thing and cartoons and memes are mot acceptable to that if we want to be taken seriously. We cant tell people that dont "get it" to just trust we arent in a bubble and this is serious when they do a quick search of our sub and find they are actually in a DBZ sub. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:29:58
Hey thanks a lot!  Do you use a hardware wallet and if so which one?  Yeah I know I was asking for crystal ball stuff but I figured maybe somebody had insight on previous forks that may be useful. I figure if the moon is where this goes for value 2-3 bitcoin for now may be very lucrative in the long term.  I am not looking to retire off it, that ship sailed already I know, but if I can finish paying off my house... then I have no debts to speak of.
