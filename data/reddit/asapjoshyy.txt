i feel like every weekend coins go down to RED 
bitcoin down a couple hundred again in the last 24 hours... just trying to buy at the perfect dip may buy another 33.3% today then save the last 33% until around aug 1st to see if it drops once more

bought 33.3% today of the 100% ill buy of bitcoin , will be watching the market to see if it dips more i think is my best plan

im only using gambling profits, so its disposable income
wouldnt go all in on such a risky thing , but i really think crypto currency is the future... but you have to hedge your bets so you dont get buried betting on just 1 coin...
hence i would like to go 40%bitcoin/30%eth/30% alt coins 
i would like to get my initial investement back with one coin then have the rest to hold long term and hope one blows up big for all profit basically... thinking bitcoin will rise back up and ill sell 60-75% of bitcoin i own to get my initial investment back then hold the other 25% along with my eth, alt currencies

i want to hit bitcoin at 3k or under cdn
it was there slightly for 10am today, but now its back up to 3.3k cdn
coinbase was closed all day while i watched prices... really hurt to watch since it was all the price point i wanted to get, hoping itll go back down under soon so i can get in and wait it out until it grows more.... same for ETH

a dip is when i want to buy, you think it will continue to drop until august 1st , or during august 1st week is when the main drop will come?? its already dropped a ton the last 3 days.... waiting for a time to pounce and invest

when are you predicting prices to hit under 2k???
i was considering buying 50% bank roll for btc now when its under 3k cdn after dropping $800 this week.... then holding off and hoping it hits under 2k and use the other 50% then , if somehow it doesnt drop ill just use the other 50% bankroll on an alt currency or ETH
a lot of people really sure bitcoin will drop under 2k before august 1st though it seems

@_date: 2017-06-16 00:22:14

@_date: 2017-06-15 17:05:24
so this is just a trolling thread apparently ?
will take nothing from this, thanks everybody

yes, no , maybe , maybe not
wow great analysis / info here lmaoooo
im just going to closely watch the pricing , if it hits 2k i will invest right away... anything under 2k would be amazing... i think BTC can hit 10k in a year or 2

im holding alt coins only right now... was waiting for dip in bitcoin to get in.... last 2 days $750-850 dip so i want to dive into some bitcoin now... just contemplating if the price will dive even deeper because i want to hit it at the bottom price of course
