As a Swiss person I don't see this happening.

I'm a Bitcoin noob too but I found the best deal with GDAX in my opinion. I set my limit orders every now and then and with those free trades it's actually worth dealing in my opinion.

Good analogy. I'll try to focus more on spreading the word instead of spending btc for now.

Besides hodling, I'd just love to actually be able to use this currency in every day life. Specially when traveling and buying stuff in other countries. That's what we all should aim for but I don't know how to do my part on this...

Lmao this is true. It's just that you are so convinced that what you are doing is great, you just can't figure why others don't see it and you can't help but tell others.

How does one support the community though? I really believe in the philosophy of this currency but it bothers me that I can't use it anywhere. I've not seen one place where I actually could use bitcoin. Also, I read a lot about Japan having more and more BTC accepting stores etc here on this subreddit - went to Japan during holidays and couldn't use bitcoins at all. I'm trying to get others to pay their debts to me with bitcoin but that hasn't worked out well either (kinda difficult for "casual" users to set up). What else can I do?

I recently started doing my part by asking others to pay me their debts to me via Bitcoin. When someone owes me a small amount of fiat money, I kindly ask them to check out the bitcoin ATM nearby and get me a paper wallet so we can make that payment with BTC. Perhaps they then see the benefits too.
