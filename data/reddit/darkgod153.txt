They are counting trades as selling to fiat, then buying another currency.

In theory the fees should be extremely minimal and thats the whole point of switching over to this type of system. As for the other question, i’m sorry but i can’t help with that. No clue.

I don’t think many people realize that while only .01% of people use it it isn’t bounded by one country alone. Bitcoin or whatever crypto-coin takes over wouldn’t be bounded by boarders and the world would be seeing its first ever global currency.

Oh wow this explanation finally did it for me. So let me just give an prepaid card analogy to make sure i got it right. So its really like having a savings account and every time you want to spend money the network automatically “deposits” money to your card and lets you pay but it all happens instantly right? So i wouldn’t have to take out money from my account, “deposit” the bitcoin to the multisigwallet, wait for that to go through, and then finally purchase. It just all happens at an instant and its to take the transaction off the blockchain network to allow for smaller transactions to take place without cluttering up the main chain. Right?

Yeah this is the dream but remember, not all dreams come true. While bitcoin is reigning as  in price and community backing it also lacks in technical aspects that other coins do hold. We might see one of these coins out so bitcoin over the next ten hears or so. Now as to whether we’ll make a decent amount is dependent on how much you hold but to say we’ll all be rocking chains that drag our necks to the floor and driving the same color lambos is crazy. Just be happy with whatever gains you make!

You can dump your own coin with zero fees or just use dogecoin. Fact: The more a network is used the more higher the fees rise. We can't escape that. After a 8MB block one needs a 100MB block, then 1GB blocks etc. It might be possible to scale the network to the size of VISA or paypal. But that's not what people with a vision have in mind. We want microtransactions and single Satoshi transactions. We want THE internet of money, the primary network for value. And that means that value is streamed, not like today sent in blocks of cash or in monthly bill payments. It means realtime money transfer. That network needs to be able to process around 10^6 the number of transactions VISA handles daily. No block size increase will fix that. We will need higher layers on top of a secure value store for that matter.
If you want/need to spend money in crypto today use Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin etc. But that's obvious and doesn't even need to be said, because no one will pay super high fees for a coffee.
Bitcoin (BTC) takes it slow with increasing the blockchain's size, because it envisions something much greater than what we have today and sees every coffee transaction written in the blockchain as a waste of space. It's a completely different approach, but it has it's right to exist. Of course every investor takes the risk that something like lightning will never work as envisioned, so it is still a very risky investment. 
This is something i copied from another post because it explains the whole bitcoin vs bitcoin cash situation from a more neutral perspective. I personally believe in both. I can see why we need quicker transactions and less fees, but the people behind the movement aren’t the most trustworthy of people. For example Roger Ver has been involved in fraud in the past and most are skeptical due to this alone. I personally find bitcoin cash to hold a lot of value but i’d rather see it be done through the original developers who haven’t done much if anything to break the community’s trust. I’m planning on writing a very detailed explanation over this very topic to clear up some misconceptions across multiple communities online(and I’m currently in Guatemala but i’ll be back to working on this by the 25th.

Well there a number of us who do day trading. I personally day trade off multiple exchanges but i make a living so i somewhat have to keep my btc on exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:03:11
Me. I received $11 worth about 3 months ago and damn its paid off haha. I moved all my btc to an exchange a month or so before and crazily enough i received $11 to my old wallet last i checked. Kinda made me laugh but i never thought how crazy it is to have had that happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:13:58
I got into crypto when my family of 4 was only making 23k as a household. I had been basically begging my parents to try and buy bitcoin cause i thought it I was being some smart kid who could make $20 from his investment and at least not be called stupid for once.  Of course they didn’t listen cause for one we were broke as fucking hell. Now the second reason was most likely because i was in middle school lol.

Damn this is kinda inspiring. I love the quote at the bottom the most. I’d only ever dream of being in the .0001% with more btc. I’ve been thinking of buying a small amount of the top 400 coins just incase one of the coins pumps up like crazy. This excludes the obvious shitcoins like jesuscoin.

Bitcoin actually takes a while before they actually sent the btc over. So for now you'll see "pending" on the transaction but later you will be able to view the transaction progress once they actually put it trough.

Someone stole your account. Probably social engineering through localbitcoins customer service system. I don't know much about any recent attacks but thats the most vulnerable access point to most of these accounts so that would be my guess. I don't know how you can hold a negative balance though.

Hey man, i turned $3000 into btc at 4000 and 4100 but i had a bit extra i wanted to exchange. I follow another trader on r/BitcoinMarkets called chewy who gives fantastic advice. I just recently asked him about when it is good to jump in again and this was his response. I hope it helps you as much as it did me.
