You make a good point. But how does one get experience of trading without trying? 
I think I'll set a certain percentage of my salary aside for bitcoin each month and try to buy on a regular basis then. Just have a bit of remorse for buying in so high and wanted to bring my average down at the same time. 
Thanks for your input.

Thats for me to know really, not something I am going to post on reddit.

I dont have so much spare money to continually invest into BTC at the moment so that wasnt really an option im afriad, or yes that would have been the best bet.

Its exciting to wait and see what happens. I wouldnt be as invested in the idea of Bitcoin if I wasnt invested. We are all on this wild ride into the unknown.

Read the stickies post on bitcoin FAQs for newcomers. Can't imagine there is anything else you need to know.

Breadwallet has been great for me.

I have a 12 word passphrase. But if the app goes under, how can I use that to have access to my coins? It's not a question of me losing my app or my phone. But if breadwallet themselves for some reason disappears, what happens then?

So what is a full node and what is a non-full node in this case? And what changes about the future scenario that bitcoin will not then be vulnerable to attacks, so that it doesn't need the full backing of bitcoin mining?

I don't know. But I'm leaving a comment to bookmark to read the replies later.

The community is welcoming which is great.  At least I am not getting slammed for my naivety 
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:55:36
I see, I was under the impression that the 12 word passphrase was for use with bread wallet only. So thanks a lot you have been a great help!

I just bought in at £817 per bitcoin. refresh Preev 10 mins later and it is at £766. Someone comfort me.

I didn't realise that the 12 word passphrase was transferable between wallet interfaces. Thought it was unique to breadwallet, and so if bread wallet disappeared, me having the keys or not, it wouldn't make a difference. But now I know the key is the key to the wallet, not the key to their service in particular.

What is FOMO?
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:44:55
So the 12 word passphrase which I have is not only for use in breadwallet, but any other wallet interface aswell? I am understanding correctly? Is this 12 word passphrase a universal for loading your wallet using other software, or do other wallets have other systems?

Did this yesterday myself. I am searching for posts like these to tend to my swollen heart. I wanted to be invested but got too eager and excited. Oh well. Long game it is. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 21:53:41
Thanks a lot that was a big help

Someone explain to me why I thought to buy in at $1000 please

What is this chart? I seem to see it everywhere. What are the good sources for bitcoin data?
