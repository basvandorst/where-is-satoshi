I know I know, I'm a silly dreamer in my ridiculous notions that someone in charge of a financial corporation operating in 42 countries, 1300 offices,  60,000 employees and US$1.9 trillion in client assets would be keeping an eye on future headline grabbing disruptive technology.

The writer of this article Alex Hern does seem to have bug up his fundament when it comes to Bitcoin. 
For what it is worth his  Twitter feed reveals he also seems to have a permanent semi for Dogecoin

Hey Good work fella.
As I originally posted the link I thought you'd appreciate this. 
Back in the late 80' &amp; 90's I worked for various dealing room technology companies including Reuters. I was part of the team that trained users on your own companies [D2000-2]( in 1992 
Back then we were all genuinely amazed that the screens were in colour (all fixed terminal green-screens before that).
I can't even imagine that anyone could have even comprehended the idea of crypto-currency let alone guessed that in less than twenty years we'd have reached this point.
Paul Julius and his pigeons would smile upon your good work.

*"do daily your jobs and you will be really great..."*
Always a big winner to have quotes that wouldn't seem out of place written on a big banner so you could read it whilst pushing your plough for nineteen hours on a collective farm.

I knew it was a bit of a shonky experiment 
I took more heart from the fact that a major business news outlet such as  Reuters are obviously taking Bitcoin et al serious enough to be doing such articles.

So they want a single currency just as long as they have complete control over it.

This was on my front page and I just assumed he'd posted it in I couldn't for the life of me work out why the fuck so many Bitcoiners kept asking him about rowing.

I'm now picturing you sending this whilst arguing with her in a motel room.

Just a side note: The Izabella Kaminska mentioned in that article has now written about Bitcoin at least [21 times]( in the FT since April this year. Which works out at about one article every two weeks for the last nine months.
In every article she's ridiculed Bitcoin and predicted its absolute and utter imminent demise.
I can't help thinking such consistently poor predictions would shame an inept astrologist let alone a highly qualified economist.

Define irony:
Twenty five years ago I was a young pup working for Reuters /Extel in the City of London. We had the only worthwhile online dealing system in town. 
Then along came a Yankee ex-broker upstart with his new fangled boxy-terminal with its weird orange type face.
The same types of people appearing on Bloomberg TV are exactly the same type of people who were dismissing Mike Bloomberg's new dealing tech back then.
