You can also get a lot of bitcoin through theft, or just by buying them.

True, but there should be a steep dropoff in the past month.

It depends on how completely its documented.  For instance, is the structure of data before encryption is known, so that transmitted data can be checked against data predicted from published protocol?

I posted something on this about an hour ago.

I'm pretty sure you can't prove that ECC doesn't have any vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:23:58
There's a lot to investigate.  For one, it depends what denomination transactions the alleged thief used to get gox to double spend.  Were they common denominations (1BTC) or oddball values with 8 decimal points?  Additionally, there should be a similar lag between the two accepted transactions, over all of the Gox double spends.  Duplicate transactions with this lag should now be significantly reduced in volume.

I hate to break it to you but cryptography is not pure math.  There are zero mathematical proofs that bitcoin is secure.  Its a belief based on the scientific method, where you publish something, then others try to repeat your work.  The cryptography has stood up to repeated tests.
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:44:43
cryptography ~~is~~ uses math.
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:09:34


How is that possible?  I thought your encrypted passwords were sent to lastpass servers.  How can you be sure the encryption happened in a way that lastpass couldn't decrypt it?
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:26:44
I agree.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:00:42
technically, you could ask the seller for his old keys, he doesn't need them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:11:10
If no one has looked, consider it a suggestion that could help shed light on what happened.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:08:42
There are allegations that the heist involved at least 3 transactions.  
1.  The first withdrawal. 
2.  The malleated transaction of transaction 1 above. 
3.  A third transaction gox sends out when they see transaction 1 has not been accepted.
Thus there should be matching transactions incorporated in the blockchain (transaction 2 and 3 above).
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:25:19
But ... there doesn't appear to be any way to verify that?  You could sniff the traffic, but you'll just see random bits, and there's no way to tell what those bits represent.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:01:24
I dunno.  A lot of areas of science use math.  Just because something uses a lot of it, doesn't make it math.  In mathematics the goal is the proof.  Even applied math isn't math.  As I am aware most academic cryptography researchers aren't in the math department.  Actually this is all a lot of beating around the bush.  I wasn't simply objecting to someones claim that you didn't have to worry about bitcoin security because it was mathematically proven secure.  Thats not correct is it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:14:18
I am suggesting looking for trasactions with the same value output.  In order to steal money from Gox with transaction malleability, you need to be able to get Gox to send you coins twice.  The output values would be the same for the two accepted transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:47:06
Just because of the intense scrutiny currently on Gox, and no one has found a smoking gun such as this.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:47:56
Don't really know how to efficiently, and I haven't lost any money personally.  I just assumed there would be people looking for this since they lost so much money.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:02:04
In my experience, with bitcoin heists, people always seem to be analyzing the blockchain.  I could be mistaken about how the heist worked, but it seems like a pretty simple first thing to do when 750k bitcoins are allegedly stolen.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:06:20
1.  If you have to buy btc to load it on the device you might pay much less (half as much, a quarter, whatever) than the mining energy, but we're only talking about saving a few cents, a silly amount to worry about.
2.  Forcing people to load satoshis adds complexity and hassle, making it feel like you are depending on outside humans to keep the device working.  Its a tether.  Its not as elegant.  Letting the device acquire its own bitcoins is more "trustless".
3.  The companies that sell these devices no longer have to depend on any outside "replenisher services" to keep their customers happy, nor will have to run it themselves.
4.  Devices, such as phones won't have to drain battery,they can just mine whenever they are plugged in.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:52:13
Not sure what you mean, the blockchain is forever.  If you mean the memory pool, then I don't follow you.   The proposed theft mechanism involves real double spends that get in the blockchain and thus are permanent.
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:49:45
Can you spot the logical fallacy in the article?
Here's a clue: we don't know the address of all of satoshi's coins.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:12:40
Okay I just found it interesting there was an obvious logical fallacy.  So I'll just point it out.  You can't state as a matter of fact that satoshi never cashed out any coins.  There's no way to no know each and every satoshi coin.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:46:23
The author of the post himself admits that Satoshi might use misdirection.  In other words, the extra nonce variation might be satoshi misdirecting people so that he could cash out some coins covertly.  The nonce clues don't rule out satoshi mining other blocks that don't employ the same nonce algorithm.  Satoshi might still be mining blocks.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:25:47
Article states that satoshi never cashed out any coins as a matter of fact.  We don't know that.
@_date: 2013-10-07 19:58:22
I think what they mean is that they can attach strong penalties to any spending of SR coins.  And if they know the addresses they can monitor them.  This is all they mean by "prevent" spending.

How do the clients search through all the prior transactions in to find the one you are spending the coins of?  Its got to make sure the prior transaction exists which gives you the right to the funds.  It seems like there are an awful lot of transactions.  Is there a transaction database or something?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:26:59
Most automated trading programs aren't programmed to account for this.  When 1000BTC bidwalls get chewed up in a few seconds, many will panic sell.  I'd guess market manipulation by a buyer.

Use a live usb stick for a secure btc environment, perhaps a Tails install.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:21:33
Thanks, but I guess I was asking how the blockchain is searched.  I guess it is a few GB of data, so how does the software search through all the transactions?

Deep web was always used to refer to webpages that google and other search engines couldn't access.  For instance, say you go to a shopping website and search for something and results come up.  Because the shopping website never linked to those pages directly, webcrawlers like google can't find them.  This is technically the deep web.
