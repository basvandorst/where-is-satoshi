You're not making sense. I'm after answers.

I have a bitcoin question, if only because someone wishes to be paid through bitcoin and I think fine, whatever.
Looking at bitcoin info on the website it starts talking about downloads and 130 GB sizes and then things such as processing power for my PC come up as being mega important so I think woah woah, back the fuck up. I'm not mining anything.
Why? Because it really doesn't explain why all of a sudden I'd have to be melting my computer running wtf computation calculations to generate numbers out of it's own arse for these things I'm supposed to be generating.
Now, 1 bitcoin is approximately AUS$8850. If I only need AUS$80 worth of bitcoin, how is this broken down? I'd rather buy the bitcoin outright then nuke my computer, which I can do, apparently. If I do am I buying a percentage of a bitcoin? As there are no cents separating the distinction between what a positive amount of bitcoin is called compared to less than a positive bitcoin amount I would be buying, do I literally just provide the figure amount I see, even though it would be an extremely small number?
As I said, I don't want to mine. I don't have the hardware, lifestyle, or shits to give, someone wants to deal in cryptocurrency so I'm doing my bit to be informed so I know enough to make this painless. Wallets can go mobile for under $1000 so it should be possible yeah? If this stuff is traded how can I be sure that $80 in cash will stay as equivalent $80 in bitcoin? I don't want someone screaming down my neck after payment saying I ripped them off, never wanting to do business with me again. Thank you.
