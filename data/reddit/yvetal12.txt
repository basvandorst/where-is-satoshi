Ok so I was obviously a little overly ambitious when I said to use it for food and books on campus at this point(lol), more so just looking to do an information session, once students begin to understand the ideas behind Bitcoin and the potential it holds with ideas like being your own bank and not having to rely so heavily upon the flawed and damn near archaic banking system we have in place I believe more and more people will see potential and that's what I'm trying to accomplish.

Appreciate it! I am relatively new to Bitcoin myself, but have been spending hours of reading and researching since my summer session of classes ended and have become completely captivated by the potential it holds for currency and the digital world.

I am not, but from this post I've been hearing a lot about it and that would be awesome if you could do that, I really appreciate it

Oh yeah, definitely going to take the payment in the form of BTC
