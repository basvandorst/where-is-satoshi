Hey, thanks for the suggestions! I'd definitely look into adding some of those next time I update the ranking. Do you know if you there are any negative things you don't like about those news sites, so I can keep them in mind?
Also, if you check the 'Notes' column for bitcoin(.)com, you'll notice that I already mentioned that ;)

I will keep updating it here: [
But it would be worth a lot more if I get everyone's input. Keep the comments "open-source" so we can be less bias.

Its a search engine full of research papers and reports about Bitcoin.

I think by "genuine", the mod was referring to the "no fake posts" rule in that sub.

If anyone is interested in getting high-quality news articles / content on their reddit feed, I made a new reddit account (u/Digital-Assets) for users to follow. I have been noticed users complain about shitty articles or articles that is based on assumptions; so I made this account to post articles the users want. Any suggestions?

"Any fool can know. The point is to understand." - Albert Einstein 
If people still find it hard to understand Bitcoin after reading the [white paper]( then they should use [Bitcite]( to do more research on the things they don't understand.

You're right. Knowing how to use Bitcoin is a *brief (or basic) understanding* of Bitcoin. Which is sufficient based on each user's reasons of using Bitcoin in the first place. In this case it would be a user just using Bitcoin. However, knowing the details of Bitcoin would be *understanding the fundamentals*; and in that case it would be developers, innovators, or institutions. Both need to understand Bitcoin, not just knowing what it is.
