 You’re new to crypto I see.
 
 Google it. They’ll explain it much better than I ever could in many less words than I’d use

It’s fucking useless
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:37:39
Yeah? No shit Sherlock. No way someone as dumb and clueless as you are has 9k to buy a “single BTC”
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:54:36
 CME futures settle soon. That’s why the price drop. Covering their short positions then when the public panics and sells for an even bigger price drop, the big boys swoop in and buy at favorable prices thus driving the price back up.
 HODL’ers aren’t making money in this market, but the traders certainly are.
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:28:29
 170,000 USD and your family is set financially? That is 70k shy of our annual income. 
Where do you live that you could be financially set with this little bit of money?

Live comfortably on 40K a year?? 
In what fantasy land does this happen? 
Even with no mortgage or car payment you still have to eat and pay property taxes, heat and cool your home and maintain a vehicle. It certainly wouldn’t leave much to travel or enjoy life on if my income was only 40k a year

Really? I own just over 6 BTC. Average cost less than 1k, and I know at least 6 others that own more than I do at a lesser cost average than me.
 I’ve never even considered that I would be an “elite” owner of BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:48:15
You’re right, brah! Only been in crypto for 6 years, brah!
 Not long at all! ��

Dump Tesla yesterday. I’m short with it, and sellers make me money, but I say sell this stock before you lose any profits you may have made on it.

Good luck with that brah!
 I not into catching falling knives so I’ll wait for 8K to get me some more of that bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:08:39
Like, OMG!! there are like 4 places I can use BTC as a currency! Like, go me!!
 If your definition of “using” BTC is simply hodling it, then English must not be your first language.
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:44:30
This. If you dollar cost average your purchases and BTC continues to go up, then you’re making money along with the rise in price.
 If BTC begins to drop, you do the same thing and each purchase buys you more and more BTC this increasing your stack.
 But if you don’t believe that someday BTC will see another ATH,  you probably shouldn’t be in this space in the first place
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:42:55

So what if they do? The question is where in the world do you live that you could survive for 30 or more years in retirement on 170k?
 I’m not debating salaries or anything else— I’m asking where you can survive on this amount of money for 30 years.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:50:09
Yesterday, around 5:34 am GMT it happened
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:06:08
 I could care less what the tax laws are with crypto. 
There is nothing backing crypto. It’s vapor ware. With stock, you actually own a piece of the company. 
 And you can’t use bitcoin for anything, o clueless one. 
I can’t believe I just replied to your complete cluelessness ��
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:41:58
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:42:15
Just buy what you can on a regular basis. If it keeps going up, your earlier purchases are worth more. If it drops then they buy more BTC.
 100 a month investment for a few years and I’d be shocked if you didn’t own at least 1/2 a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:42:53
By 6:24 pm eastern standard time today  we will be there
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:18:39

Fuck bro, why you gotta harsh my buzz like that, bro?
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:06:37
Nah, it’s based on the fact that the stock is shit and many are finally seeing that fact.
FA is nearly as worthless as TA, but let’s not let that fact get in the way of you thinking you know what you’re talking about.
 And obviously you care or you wouldn’t have commented.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:43:23
When you’re sitting on 100 billion in cash even a 1% return is generating huge profits
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:55:31
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:41:48
You go, big spender!
 To be safe, reserve at least 250, or 25% of your investment for when BTC pulls back a bit, because it will. It may not be next week or next month, but it will and when it does, you’ll have some ammo to fire.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:55:03
This is correct. But why do you need possession of .005 of a BTC?
 Robinhood makes it easy to jump in and out of BTC. Sure, there’s a big markup when buying but if all you’re looking to do is make a few bucks then Robinhood meets your needs
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:16:55
None and no
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:50:08
These guys commenting must not have any assets other than their .000456 of a BTC to be this clueless.
 Gimme a lifetime of steady 5-8% average gains and I’ll be a wealthy old man one day... which I’ve already achieved at age 55. 
 I also own some BTC and lots of shitcoins that may or may not make me some fiat in the future.
My point is to never dismiss any forms of investing/ speculation that may increase your net worth.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:48:39
If you like paying way too much of a premium and it taking forever for your fiat to hit your account, then yeah, use Abra.
 Coinbase for deposits then move it to Coinbase pro and don’t pay any commissions.

Tree fiddy by noon tomorrow!

Don’t know what you’re doing wrong then. I’ve been using them for 5 years now.
@_date: 2019-09-13 18:19:39
I could easily do that here in the middle of a cornfield in Iowa, but combined we make 250k. Don’t have a mortgage and haven’t in 10 years. We pay cash for slightly used vehicles and drive them until they die. My kids attend public schools and we will pay 100% of their undergraduate degrees through saving in a 529 plan. 
 Saving nearly 75k a year currently and we will be very comfortable in our retirement.
 We understand how fortunate we are to be able to earn the amount of money we do in a place that costs as little as it does to live.
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:05:03
Why would I give a shit about the dump? I’ve owned bitcoin since 750 and I add to my holdings every time it drops under 5000.
 You tools that own .0001 of a bitcoin that you bought at ATH should just sit down, shut up and learn something already
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:25:52
You couldn’t be any more clueless if you tried. But I’m sure you’ll give it your best shot!
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:18:12
Yep. Futures contracts settle tomorrow, then watch the quick return to at least 10k, maybe 12k if we get enough FOMO.
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:41:16
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:07:46
Cool story, bro!
 have your fiat ready and buy like a madman anytime it drops below 10k USD.

Nope, I don’t grow anything. Never been a farmer, just live in a small farming community because we chose to.
 We are both professionals with masters degrees. She’s an environmental engineer and I’m a regional sales rep for a Fortune 500 company.
 Our town of 5000 is 20 miles north of an area of western  Illinois/ eastern Iowa known as the quad cities. It’s a metro area of 350k about 3 hours west of Chicago.  
Her plant is 15 minutes east of our house and I’m on the road 3-4 nights a week and both regional airports that I use to travel from are within a 45 minute drive. 
Again, we truly understand how fortunate we are to be able to live in a quiet and safe area and earn the salaries we do. 
Those same airports I use to travel for work have taken us to places like Tanzania last October for a 10 day safari.

You, too?
 I’m holding 1.75 million DENT and am also hoping I can upgrade to a supersized meal when its time to get rid of them.
To be fair, I’ve owned and traded DENT since shortly after its ICO.
Rode it to nearly it’s ATH of .11; I sold most of my holdings between .077-.105. Made some nice money and held a bunch hoping it would continue to go up.  You know what’s happened to its price since January of 2018. Ugh. ��

IRS audits less than 2% of all taxpayers and of those most are extremely wealthy. 
 Unless you’re buying and selling tremendous amounts of bitcoin, your exchange won’t be reporting it anyway. 
 But if you’re that worried about it, I’m sure calling the IRS directly would provide you the answers you’re seeking here.
