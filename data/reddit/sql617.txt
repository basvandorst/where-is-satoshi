I’m in accordance with much of what you said, however I wouldn’t totally correlate BTC to the latest apple products. There is a reason why sales are declining and have been for a while. Companies, like Huawei, have been selling superior products for a fraction of the price. I’d be more apt to describe BTC as the first generation iPhone. A total game changer.

With the volatility of BTC these days, it can rise or fall 2% in a matter of an hour. Won’t that be a turn off?

We’ll likely hit 3700 this week. I’m sensing we haven’t bottomed yet.

Pretty much all wallets will take about 5 days for a bank transfer. Some better ones than CoinBase include kraken and Gemini.
Don’t be fooled, CoinBase says 5-7 days but for most people is far longer and even more days to send.

Ah sorry I misspoke. Let’s hope you’re right! 
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:14:49
Gotcha, I’ve only used it to track my transactions getting confirmed. Is that ok?

“For VPNs and stuff...” You said it yourself, at the moment there is very little convenience to pay in BTC other than niche products and black market items. Until people can use it to pay for groceries, gas, and other necessities it is a far more inconvenient method than fiat (other than in Venezuela apparently) . You are the 1%, if that’s the only reason for you to own BTC. I truly hope this changes.

Sure, but I thought we were talking about the upcoming fork. I’d love for BTC to reach 1 Million by then, but reality says that’s a pipe dream.

Why avoid blockchain.info? I’m new to this whole thing but have used it prior.

I’m not so sure then. I purchased bitcoin on February 21st via ACH bank transfer. By the 22nd it had cleared my account, and Coinbase says there are two days left on my hold.

Look like a poem. A for effort.

After the 72 hrs, the BTC will arrive on my  kraken address. Do you know if I can send it to another address immediately from there? Or are they known for this 72 hrs nonsense?
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:51:02
I’ve been thinking about the long haul, I’ve only been doing shorts for the past few months. I really want to learn more about the technology before then.

This is if you do a bank (ACH) transfer. Using a debit card is instant. It also depends on what level of access your account is. Mine is level 3 and ACH have a 5 day hold.

After a 5 day hold on my ACH from CoinBase I finally have my BTC available to send. However, when I try to send there is a 72 hour hold to “prevent fraud”. 
Is it possible to send my BTC over to kraken and then send to another address immediately? 
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:13:04
Me too. I have been a customer of CoinBase for 3+ years, their new policies are ridiculous. There is clearly something wrong with their business strategy.
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:20:06
What is it?
@_date: 2019-02-24 14:47:11
Bought again at 3,790$ couldn’t agree more. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:17:13
He is probably talking about ACH bank transfer. Those are never instant, no need to be so accusatory.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:36:21
Try 5-15 days.
