They might not make mixing illegal - but policies that reject stolen coins can make it a stupid move for those who are engaged in legal activities.

If early bitcoins were put into a trust that Satoshi no longer fully/easily controls then there is a good reason why he originally tried to use human trust to convince everyone.
Edit: Obviously he now needs to put up or shut up, but this is a storyline that is consistent with Craig Wright being Satoshi.

If all investors allocated 1% of their portfolios towards gold...
(Interesting how these stories sound the same)

It's like the internet bubble of the 90's. Most of the valuations were BS and massively overpriced/overhyped, but there was still a lot of value that came out of it for a few investors - Google (granted it was a private investment), for instance.
Bit coin is different because it is one thing. The irrationality here seems to be around certain bitcoin based companies getting funding. Either these companies need the ability to easily switch to doing something else or most people investing in the companies should just be long bitcoin if they aren't trying to do a philanthropic investment.
Note: the 99% of times isn't about a specific thing like a fiat digital crypto-currency. It's about claims that a new tech paradigm is going to change the world.

Have you seen any of his stuff? He's [pretty awesome](
And yes, he's very outspoken. He'll call it like he sees it. And any student of history &amp; finance looking at bitcoin is going to see the telltale signs of past bubbles and will act accordingly. In that sense its completely within his paradigm.  If he lives long enough to see that he is wrong about crypto currencies he'd be frank about how he missed it.

1. A lack of supply of bitcoin is driving up the price - this is great for bitcoin to some extent (at a certain point it makes investing in a competing crypto currency very profitable - and when competing crypto-currencies exist it will be bad for bitcoin). Selling bitcoin now - not to drive up the price but to create more supply to accommodate demand should help the bit coin ecosystem more than hoarding coins. Edit: You've probably thought about this a lot more than me and given that you haven't sold many coins yet you obviously disagree - but  is the more important point.
2. You can do a lot more than buy "things" with your money. You can start investing in smaller projects that have low probability/high impact potential. You don't have to wait until you can afford to build a seastead or buy an island to make an impact. At some point it makes sense to take a large amount of money off the table to invest in other projects. 
Good luck.
