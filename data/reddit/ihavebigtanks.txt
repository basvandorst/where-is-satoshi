Ooooh I'm the one throwing out assumptions? 
That's interesting, considering that's what this entire post is: *you* making assumptions 
Don't attempt to validate you're own point, I don't care. But if you won't, don't bitch when I call you stupid for saying stupid things

Hahahaha omg! What a well thought out and intelligent rebuttal!
You're clearly just really really fucking stupid. You couldnt refute a word I said so you've resorted to insults and threats. *That* is truly fucking pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:15:21
You did a wonderful job at avoiding the entire question. You cant actually discuss the economic concepts at the heart of the discussion, so you just point to the current state of affairs. The federal reserve has existed for more then 100 years, and the concept of fractional reserve banking for much longer still, and yet you think the last 6 years is a rebuttal of the entire concept. Yes, the current monetary system is so horrible because of the last 6 years, even though the last hundred have been amazingly prosperous. 
Jesus christ are you serious? Are you even capable of discussing the concepts at work, or are you just capable of cherry picking data?
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:02:00


No, you just want it to mean that! How in the world could you possibly think a 100 year old system that functioned fine for a hundred years is entirely discredited by 6 years? Its wishful thinking. Its confirmation bias. You cant draw any clear line between the two, but it fits what you believe so it must be true!


And saying the last 6 years has been shitty is not a good argument to scrap a system that has functioned fine for 100 years. 
Thats why all of this talk about the current economy is a pointless distraction. For any sort of productive discussion to be hard, the economic concepts at the heart of all this need to be dissected. But you are refusing to do that.

Im trying to discuss something! I'd love to have an indepth discussion about either the federal reserve, or fractional reserve banking. What your problems with those systems are, and why you're wrong. But you cant do anything but make unsubstantiated claims and ridiculous statements. 
Once again, you've entirely ignored everything I said in the last post. Wanna talk more about how a 100 year old system is a failure because of one 6 year period?

Libertarian isn't exactly an economic philosophy. I more refer to the rabid Austrian teenagers that seem to populate this sub that think they know what they're talking about, but really have no clue. " Ron Paul says the dollar has lost 96% of its value since 1913!! The sky is falling the sky is falling!"
And Keynesian newbies? Why are they newbies? Classical Keynesianism made a lot of mistakes, but post-Keynesian analysis is unquestionably the most accurate description of how things work that we have

Oh god the idiocy is strong with this one.
Do you really wanna have a discussion about bitcoin and economics? 
Lets start with the basics, the one thing all of you seem to want so badly: bitcoin as a truly global currency, eclipsing all others. 
Do you honestly not understand how a stagnant monetary base, and therefore built in deflation, can destroy an economy? If you can't understand the basic logic behind that, you're an idiot. 
Oh and don't even get me started on your irrational hatred of the fed. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 01:39:39
What part do you want me to refute? 
The nonsense claim that banks stole $16 trillion though the fed, when really it was all overnight loans paid back within 48 hours of being issued? 
The red herring that somehow suggests the tax payers would have some how been better off without TARP, just letting the banks collapse? 
For real everything this kid said in the second half of the video was fucking bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 23:54:56
Because its $16 trillion in *overnight* loans. Nothing was stolen from anyone. this kid is a fucking idiot
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:39:49
I have no idea how anyone thinks that graph makes sense, considering the dollar has only existed since 1913. 
Oh not to mention your graph covers over two centuries and bitcoin dropped 28% in less than a week. 
Oh and not to mention the periods of greatest decline, after the creation of the fed, also happen to coincide with the period of greatest economic prosperity in american history. 
Maybe theres something about basic economics that you dont understand? Maybe that applies to basic history as well?

What the hell does this have to do with anything? Ok so a smaaaall fraction were long term loans. 1/26. 
It doesnt change the fact that a loan thats been paid back isnt stealing from anyone. All of the money given out was paid back. 
This kid is still an idiot.

.....The Dollar in its current form has existed since 1913. Different forms of US currency issued by entirely different entities have existed since basically this country's inception, but they have nothing to do with the current dollar

So, I'm in the bitcoin subreddit. I'm not here to troll or hate, I like and use bitcoin. I'm more trying to talk sense into some people. It's a great currency fit perfectly for the Internet and is a great innovation. But no, it will never entirely replace existing currencies. More likely, those currencies will adapt to the digital age. Within a few decades dollars will be digitalized and many advantages of bitcoin will be folded into the existing currency system.


So even ignoring problems with wages, how do you think credit would function in a deflationary economy. I know you probably irrationally hate all debt, but credit is what builds economies. Deflation makes it exponentially harder to pay off debts. Can you imagine what a mortgage denominated in bitcoins would cost taken out just a year ago? Jesus Christ. Not to mention the bank runs and financial panics that would ensue without a central bank to provide credit when it's needed. 


You're wrong in thinking that low inflation in inherently bad, and that the fed is destroying the dollars value so rapidly, and that thats a bad thing you might not be wrong about the actual function of the fed, although I suspect you might be, but you're wrong about the implications. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:41:41
The very purpose of the 2% inflation target is to push people to spend money instead of holding it. Im not sure if you realize, but an economy doesnt work very well when everyone just sits on their money. 
Please go learn basic economics and then come back and talk to us.

You do realize that net debt is 0, right? A nation cannot magically get more prosperous because it borrows money, because that money, by necessity, comes from someone else that has saved it. Borrowing money is simply putting to use savings that would otherwise have sat idle. 


I understand fully how fractional reserve banking works, trust me, you dont need to explain it. There is no need for 100% reserve banking. Anywhere. If you dont like banks loaning out money, put your money in a safe hidden away somewhere. The entire concept of 100% reserve banking is nothing but a pure waste of savings. Thats it.


Fake liquidity? What? More liquidity than the market determines is needed? As if, without a central bank, in a credit crunch the financial market can simply decide its going to "make" more liquidity as they see fit? No. Thats *why* the fed is there. The level of liquidity isn't always what the financial system needs, they cant just make more. That makes 0 sense. 


Oh my god no. Do you have any concept of how things work? Simply supplying more loanable funds to banks doesnt mean theyre going to give out loans to whoever wants them. Banks still arent going to willingly lose money on an investment. Theyre still only going to give out loans to people with investments that they think can realize a return. Increasing the amount of money available to banks to lend out only allows them to realize the full potential of their lending, it doesnt cause them to just give out loans to whoever wants them, because theyre still only concerned about making a profit on those loans, which requires the investment to be sound.


*Someone?* You do! We do! That 2% increase in prices comes from an increase in the money lent out by banks!


Lol 7%!!! Oh my god where the hell are you getting your nonsense numbers? Shadow stats?? Checked the price of gas recently? Flat for years now. Oh the inflation!!!
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:47:58
If your understanding of monetary policy is that prices will increase proportionally to the number of dollars created by the fed, then sure, thats a reasonable thing to expect. 
Of course reality is absolutely nothing like that. Creating a massive amount of excess reserves and thereby increasing the amount of available loanable funds, doesnt actually increase the demand of those funds by the banks theyre offered too. If it did, QE would have created a ridiculous amount of inflation. The monetary base increased by 400%, by your logic prices should have increased by 400% since the start of QE. Of course the increase has been more like 1-2% annually, so obviously something else is going on here that you and utuxia arent understanding. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:51:17
Theres one giant problem here. All of this is based entirely on the technological aspect, and not the economic aspect. Sure, bitcoin has a great chance of replacing other payment protocols. But it has basically no chance of replacing fiat currency outright. A bitcoin economy would be one with built in deflation and no central bank. 
I know how good some of you think that sounds, but it just shows how little you know of economics.

While its true that bitcoin *couldnt* have a central bank because any such bank would have no power to create bitcoins, and therefore would be pretty much useless, people here really do need to realize the problems that come without a central bank. A bitcoin based economy would be disasterous because of this. Theres way to provide liquidity to financial institutions in the event of some sort of panic.

@_date: 2014-08-05 17:34:52
And yet even there you're sorely mistaken. The amount of money the fed prints isnt actually directly linked to inflation. The fed has nearly quadrupled the monetary base in 5 years, and we've had average to below average inflation. Because most of that money still sits at the fed. 
This is why people hate this subreddit, 90% of people here are ignorant of economics. Demand-pull inflation, what you're talking about, is often summed up as too many dollars chasing too few goods. Pumping more money into the system cant make businesses and workers magically produce more. The problem is in a depressed economy, producers *can* produce more. 
Without capacity utilization being filled, money printing isnt going to cause inflation. Instead, producers will produce more. Once they cant produce any more, they will raise prices. And not only that, but to further complicate things, banks dont just lend out money because they have more money. Theyre still looking for good investments, theyre not going to lose money on a loan by giving credit to someone that will default. So in a depressed economy, the fed attempts to give money (simplified) to banks, but banks have no worthy debtors to give it to, so it just sits there waiting to be used. 
Please stop ranting about inflation and money printing when you clearly havent the slightest idea how this works. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:14:53




No, the purpose is to provide liquidity to credit markets, ease the deleveraging of debt, and deter hoarding (which is detrimental to an economy in a very basic sense a kindergartener should be able to understand.)


The level is savings is too high, in a healthy economy the interest rates should create a situation where Savings = Investment. Investment is too low, because businesses do not have enough demand for their goods. 


What a massive failure to understand basic economics. If you save too much, inflation does fall. Because...that economy falls into a depression!


For realz!?!


God you're an ignorant prick. You obviously have no idea what I think, nor how the economy works on a basic level. Both saving and spending serve vital functions in the economy, but without investment opportunities to utilize those savings, theyre just slightly more than entirely pointless. 




Oh spare me your austrian holier than though bullshit nonsense economic theories made by first graders in between nap time and finger painting. 2% inflation is destroying the world!!!! Yea right. You think this is a keynesian proposition, the idea that low inflation is beneficial? Son this goes back to the 70's. This is milton friedmans main contribution to monetary policy. This is basic economic knowledge accepted by anyone that has more than a single brain cell. 
Go the fuck back to school and leave the actual economic analysis to people that know what theyre talking about. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:58:32
Is it a coincidence that the creation of the federal reserve and the solidification of the fractional reserve system coincide with the greatest period of prosperity in american history?
Fractional reserve banking puts savings to use. 100% reserve banking is the most inefficient possible banking system. 
The federal reserve system provides liquidity to the credit market while maintaining a *healthy* 2% inflation target. 
Wanna discuss either of those things? Or would you rather continue to just assert the superiority of your viewpoint because you watched a couple youtube videos after school one day?

You realize how transparent this is, right? Im sure you've deluded yourself into thinking that you're actually right, and that im brainwashed. But the problem with that theory is your inability to stick with this conversation or refute even a single thing i've said. You're the one whos brainwashed into this austrian nonsense. You cant actually have a discussion about economics, because you dont actually know anything about economics. You can only speak in exaggerated claims and nonsense platitudes.

Its insane to you because you dont know what you're talking about! It could be much worse soon, except that all the fed has to do is unwind the asset purchases by selling the treasuries its purchased. Again, you do not know what you're talking about. 


Is that your professional economic analysis? Because when you say "Basically everything and everyone is over-saturated because of the previous mania phase", even the wording you use makes it clear that you have a vague understanding of whats going on. 


Man....I wish i had the power to turn random statements into fact simply by virtue of claiming something is true. 


Most of that is nonsense. Sure there are periods of higher and lower growth, or even contraction, but the notion that uninterrupted periods of prosperity necessitate a recession in the future is just nonsense. Its faith based economics, there is no logic or science behind any of that thought. And the idea that most of you seem to have that doing anything to alleviate a depression is just putting off the inevitable, is again nonsense economics. All this talk of some natural balance, where a crash must ensue and you have to take the pain as punishment for the prosperity, has absolutely no basis in reality. 


Oh, banks profit. I'm not really seeing how its at the expense of other people though. 


Oh jesus christ. An economy where bitcoin was the central currency would be a disaster. You think *I'm* in some fiat centered circle jerk? Jesus christ kid go look in a mirror, this sub is fucking economic cancer.
