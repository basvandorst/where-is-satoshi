I have not watched bitstamp chart for a very long time. I guess they are still open.

I think one of the main reason Bitcoin went $1,000 was because of China. I still do think it will go up but not too much in short time. Maybe possible after 10 years but not within few years.

I get 5% from winning pot and advertising (point faucet)
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:34:58
Oh. I see. At the time of writing code, I wasn't able to find API for DASH. I will include it on next update. :)

You can collect points every hour or win points then buy crypto raffle tickets.
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:21:39
I will think about it. Thx :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:34:34
Should be already in the list.
@_date: 2014-09-08 09:35:41
no one knows...
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:16:46

I started this project more than 4 month ago and it's still on-line without any incident. My cut is 5% and I get most of income from google advertisement. Also check out  for previous post.

Also don't forget to use free welcome points to buy Point Raffle Ticket for chance to win $10 worth of CT USD.

Its Faucet site. You are not welcome.
@_date: 2016-03-13 09:13:10
 I don't welcome rude people so if you too then don't.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:41:03
Exactly.. when I posted this I had to use converter to make sure it was correct amount in Bits
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:28:33
I don't think most juries will know what Bitcoin is and understand..
@_date: 2016-03-24 05:46:10
Thats why I dont use bank deposit. Here in Canada coinbase allows interac e-transfer. Its instant and simple. ($3,000 daily limit..)
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:27:06
It is not an open-source project at the moment but I might consider it. Thx.
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:16:41
Okay. Thx

Not everyone is smart like us.. (Bitcoiners) Lol!
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:17:39
cool. is this going to be free after beta?
@_date: 2016-05-15 02:12:08
If you use adsense, yes. Its is profitable until you get your account banned. Make sure to read and understand terms of service.
@_date: 2016-07-25 18:09:31
It is possible. The problem is chargeback. Credit card/PayPal can reverse the payment but Bitcoin can't.
