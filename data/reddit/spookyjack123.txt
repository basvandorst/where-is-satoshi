Remember that correlation does not equal causation. Bitcoin is not YET at a point in which it can cause this large of an interruption in the global banking system. This level and this type of hype is tripe.

It's entirely likely that there are groups or individuals in the Chinese banks that are holders of Bitcoin, and are attempting to produce bull or bear markets to suit their Bitcoin trading desires. This seems like a ploy by the Chinese banks (or the media) to manipulate the price.

Am I the only one who has Bitcoin not show up as a payment option when checking out on Newegg ? I'm trying to buy a backup camera using Bitcoin for my truck, but I can't seem to find where Bitcoin is listed as a payment option.

How to pay Bitcoin taxes ? Easy, you don't. Sorry brah, I'm not throwing money at a bunch of despot vultures who don't give two shits about me, or my country's people. My Bitcoin will outlast this oligarchical cleptocracy.

I'm actually currently living almost entirely off of Bitcoin,  I buy my groceries at target &amp; whole foods (Using Gyft), I buy my electronics at overstock, &amp; Newegg, Gas is the only thing I have to sell Bitcoin to buy. If I could buy gas at the gas station of my choice using Bitcoin, then I would truly be living 100% off of Bitcoin.
Living off of Bitcoin completely, in a comfortable way is surprisingly easy to do.

To be honest, I'm only 17 so I still live with my parents haha
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:12:08
I'd do 100%. Then again, am 16, so even if I lose everything, I'm not really screwed.

If any of you guys want to print to my RepRap, I'll gladly accept Bitcoin haha, it's my own personal printer, but I only use it on rare occasion so I'll gladly print whatever you want me to in exchange for BTC.

As someone running two Bitcoin nodes, one at home, at one at an office I do IT work for (Owner is a supporter of Bitcoin and allowed me to do it, even thanking me after I got it running), Block size honestly doesn't bother my storage requirements, The blockchain could be 250GB on my current servers and I literally **Would NOT CARE**, Can we just up the damn block size already, and go on to more important issues, like how we can use this amazing protocol to address micropayments in greater depth, or B&amp;M establishment integration. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:39:11
Bitcoin as a protocol in way forces you to give said Bitcoin to any of those people. Everything listed are actions you can do with Bitcoin. Federal reserve notes are inheritanly fraudulant, by their nature of existance. Bitcoin is not. That is the difference.

Let's create a Linux distro that hosts a p2pool node &amp; a web page interface, allowing for basic users to use p2pool with ease. Programmers &amp; supporters PM me if interested, we are going to tackle this issue, right now.

Don't worry guys, even if all the current miners were to stop due to global natural disaster, We can just fire up all of our 350 Mh/s USB ASICs that everyone seems to own

A valid point indeed, it is sad that we still live in a world where socioeconomics and geopolitics stand in the way of a type one society. Bitcoin is an answer to the global financial unification question, however third world countries need bandwidth to match, thank you for bringing this point up, I believe, as I'm sure many in here as well do, that we need active politics in these nations that encourages uncensored, fast internet access, not only for Bitcoin, but more broadly, something even more important than currency, that being the education of our world's children. Sorry if I went a bit off topic, I just think you raised a good point and it is imperative that we as members of the global society address it both for our own financial drive in Bitcoin, and as well as the betterment of the world through education and free information.

Do the conditions described actually affect entropy?

I've been wanting to watch "a film about coffee" on Vimeo, but I can't because they don't accept Bitcoin. The moment they do, I'll be first in line to buy the film. It's a shame they don't accept it yet, because I've heard good things about the movie!

Ripple is still a thing?

That's not an SHA public key, that pertains to your GLBSE login, not a BTC wallet.

*complete scam
@_date: 2013-10-09 20:09:49
Okay. Here is what you do. Ready ? aaaand Go:
Create a system that is capable of generating large amounts of wallets (Private key and public key) with as little resources as possible, but has the highest level of entropy possible ( using a physical random number generator that cannot be exploited by the NSA comes to mind --&gt;  )
Next you make each generated keypair good for one transaction only, so one wallet deals with one sale, and then is never used by the site's escrow system again. The keypair will be visible to the buyer, allowing them to retrieve the funds if the site goes down mid transaction.
As an added layer of security (and this is paranoia grade shit) you have a hardware button that doubles as an activator for a script that announces issues on the site and routes the domain to a second server in a second location, allowing for the user funds to be retrievable even if the buyer loses his/her private key mid transaction. 
Finally, the site's revenue is routed through a shared wallet of some time that trickles the money into a large number of public keys that automatically regenerate.
Bear in mind that There is NO perfect online open marketplace, and even with this level of security there can still be issues. I am not advocating the sale of anything that is outlawed, and I am not interested in coding such a site (so please don't raid me Mr. Officer). HOWEVER it could easily be done. Take my information with a grain of salt.
EDIT- replace the power button with the hardware switch button, and superglue the electrical cabling (not safe I know I know) so that if the Feds try and hit the power button, it activates the script, you could even have a sensor in place where if it appears that the power switches are being pulled, or the server is being yanked/moved/shaken etc etc it activates the script, this could be done with ease using tin foil contacts for contact protection, and a Memsic 2125 (here-  ) and a Raspberry Pi operating on the same VLAN as the main server.
@_date: 2013-07-10 21:26:33
Okay, thanks :) Give me a public address and I'll send some of my dividend money your way as a token of my appreciation :)
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:59:04
Okay, so if the public key shows that there is still funds in it, you should take the private key, and do a WALLET SWEEP using Armory. I'd be more than happy to show you exactly how to do a wallet sweep and walk you through it on Skype if you message me :) Best of luck !

USB Miners are a great tool to ensure the natural decentralization of mining, and prevent only the "Big boys" from getting a slice of the pie. I hope to see even more powerful USB miners available for the same price too !

I'd do .05 :)
@_date: 2013-10-08 00:32:19
Okay okay okay. These type of posts piss me off. Here's why; 
Imagine if I go out to my local bodega and buy a red bull with some fiat (let's say a 20USD bill), but at one point years and years ago, that 20USD bill was used by a random lad to by a small amount of Marijuana, does that mean the feds should take my 20USD that I recieved legally ? NO. Just because the Silk Road processed 600,000 Coins, doesn't mean that it has 600,000 coins ripe for the taking.
Next we have the simple fact that once a Bitcoin is in my wallet, it is now MY bitcoin. It isn't John Smith's, or Sally Smart's, It's my coin, on my device, my paper, or in my head. And unless they take the private key via either bruteforce, or by manually breaking my door down with guns, they will never, EVER be able to take that coin.

I could build one of these for less than 1,500 USD, easily. Actually you know what ? Let's do it. Anyone with any experience with the Rasberry Pi, Arduino, 3D printing, and general electronics, drop me a message, let's build a prototype for less than 1,500 USD, and make it retail for ~8-10 BTC

How do I find when the increases are ?

It's now at 48, should I sell on the next increase ? Right when it reaches 0 ? is that when I'll get my dividend ? when bitcoincharts thingy that shows how many blocks to go reaches zero ?
@_date: 2013-08-29 00:14:28
Have any experience in programming or electronics ? I'll give you a split if your interested in working on this with me, drop me a message, I already have plenty of components for making a prototype

Add a repo that supports it and then YUM install bitcoin-qt 
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:26:11
One thing we have to bear in mind is that this may be merely the Bitcoin-qt software, that downloads the entire blockchain. Most Bitcoin users (My grandmother, my father, and most of my friends included) don't download the full Bitcoin-qt software, they instead install Electrum or another piece of software that connects to the nodes, which may not be included in this Penetration Degree table.
That being said, I could be wrong on the table's data, but either way, I do believe that the actual numbers are significantly higher.

I totally agree ! 
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:58:18
Why not instead of viewing Bitcoin as something that hold until it hits the moon, let's look at it as a new paradigm in currency, a true deflationary currency that can be sent globally in SECONDS, a currency that has saved businesses, farmers, and lives. Let's stop looking at Bitcoin as an investment like gold or silver, and start looking at it as currency. I for one have 8USD to my name right now, the rest is in Bitcoin, and I use it every day without trouble. If we all did the same, the world would be a better place.
