I think few merchants can accept with zero confirmation and if payment is not received later for some reason the service provided to the customer can be cancelled, for example cancel hotel room booking or flight ticket etc.
Volatility can be minimized if they instantly sell it for fiat, merchants who can hodl should be okay with the volatility

I don't agree that bitcoin doesn't need miners. It needs more and more miners to join from different geo locations and mine using their own pool or join some pool which has less contribution to total hash power

"As a default policy, only compressed public keys are accepted in P2WPKH and P2WSH. Each public key passed to a sigop inside version 0 witness program must be a compressed key: the first byte MUST be either 0x02 or 0x03, and the size MUST be '33' bytes. Transactions that break this rule will not be relayed or mined by default."

Yeah non kyc derivatives exchanges can help provide to an alternative solution to fix the volatility issue as well for the merchants accepting bitcoin payments
I had read one medium article which looks interesting and relevant to your comment:
 
Also Jack Mallers had talked about on chain fees derivatives in the recent LN conference
For now solutions like payment forwarding looks good imo

Wow! Thanks for my first ln tip on Reddit
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:23:23
I never said it's new
I said I referred to it and think it's compression
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:14:43
Okay Thanks
I hope you read my first reply to a comment above about the things I read about before posting this like compression of public keys 
Anyways you are more focused on PNG JPG not the basic proposal. So thank you so much for destroying everything.
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:39:46
Now I am sure you are here just to express your sadness and not interested to comment about the overall thought mentioned in the post 
First you had an issue with PNG JPG now trying to assume things and stop me from discussing something just because you think Peter Wuille and other Bitcoin devs are fools that they see it as compression and you are smart by calling it as truncation 
Have a great day ahead!

I am not from Italy and never been there. I have listed everything I got online about Bitcoin payments and Italy that could make some sense. Still wasn't sure about the numbers and have mentioned it in the medium post.
Also I missed a point about darknet markets activity in Italy

Agree non kyc peer to peer to exchanges are best for privacy

- You dont need to be a social media influencer or CEO/CTO etc. to be a speaker in the meetup. We value your research and knowledge.
- Meetup is free, dont have to pay anything for the event
- Few extra benefits for the speakers
- Research topics should focus on problem solving related to Bitcoin and LN 
- Its fine if someone cant attend the meetup but still wants to share the research, we will include it in the event
- Meetup will be recorded for the presenations part however live streaming may or may not be possible. We will share the video and slides+research docs(if any) after the event
- There will be a small party after the presenations and few giveaways too

I was hoping if it was possible to compress the transaction before being included in a block by miner but after a user broadcasted it so that more transactions can be included in the block 
Few things that I read before posting this:
Compressed public keys: 
bcash xthinner protocol to compress block which is ironical but read about it just to be aware of technical possibilities 
Maybe more improvements have been suggested earlier similar to this and will have to research more

Use xmr.to

It was a not a direct comparison but I had initially discussed it in a telegram group earlier and wanted even less tech savvy people to understand what I am trying to say that's why used such example

I was doing this calculation for spending transaction so that fees can be decided by user accordingly in such a setup 
Thanks ��

"grind the key" 
Can I read more about this somewhere? Or any post which talks about this and/or has proof of concept?
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:01:15
Interesting. What do you suggest?
@_date: 2019-12-09 10:17:34
Thanks for explaining. Got the idea of what you were talking about. Will read more about it.

Thanks for your response
In the example mentioned here:
 
I see 1 input and 1 output, how would I calculate the size of script?
