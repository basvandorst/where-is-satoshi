a) Do you own bitcoin?
b) Which coin would you buy - why and and at what price?

At [tempo]( we are partnering with [Maicoin]( and you could use our service to pay from Eurozone to taiwan in BTC...
That said it has not yet launched so you could get the person in Taiwan to create an account on Maicoin and then send them BTC there that you have purchase at a European exchange (kraken, Bitstamp etc). Maicoin allows Taiwanese to cash out their BTC to accounts.

LN is not in the blockchain so they are not bitcoin tx. they are a layer on top of btc that said they look data wise much like a bitcoin tx with a wrapper.

I made 128% return on my small investment. only one bad loan. Maybe atypical?

Again going back to the original question. Anne prints out a bitcoin on paper and hands it to bob. Does lightning help? No.
Second use case:
Anne sends 1 bitcoin from her Coinbase account to Expedia (Bitpay). In this case my understanding it works seamlessly.

Why Did they force out Gavin? that is my main question. We would have 2 mb a year ago if they didn't. 
Also why not just setup a off chain netting system between exchanges and wallets? Why try to force it onto bitcoin?

kraken is popular.

Regulation depends on the state and the exchange can depend on how much leverage you want to use.
The most popular ones are Bitfinex and Kraken. GDAX (coinbase) may be ok I haven't tried. OKCoin is also popular.
Localbitcoin can be good if you have cash or can negotiate directly with a local whale.

In Europe (FR) the incentive is that the funds have to be deposited in a segregated account if it takes more than 2 days...
@_date: 2016-06-07 12:16:00
and kraken has more volume already on USD/BTC...
The current issues are not number of exchanges they are:
1) Fees are too high for Interac/getting money to the exchange
2) Volumes = Bid/Ask spread
More exchanges will not fix this...

" To date, DFS has received 26 BitLicense applications, and has approved four virtual currency firms for charters or licenses"
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:46:48
So my understanding is that is a risk based approach. So the answer is "it depends"...

any idea of the channels management? It comes with a server (python based?)
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:15:40
any way to cash out? Or can you buy a ticket with btc?
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:43:40
Yes and Options has [19 million messages per second]( Capacity is not necessary for Bitcoin success depending on the use case.

shakepay.io is canadian company basically the same as shift. Maybe less support. Bit cheaper for international payments.
They don't have a CAD card though and occasionally the cards get blocked as they are issued in gibralter

No we traded control by bankers for control by Miners ;-)

Which country? Due to interchange fees buying with CC will always be more expensive than SEPA, ACH, etc. Wire transfers will be cheaper for large volumes.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:18:28
Sometimes higher - sometimes lower over the past couple of years....

remind me to short when btc passes gold - currently: 1,253.20 On Nov 30th 2013 it was 1251...
 or when the market cap meets 10% of GLD and the btc price is $63,000 ;-)

From here..
Should I use their new merchant API?

Can you tell me more about the bitcoin scene in France? How many people do you think have a bitcoin wallet? 
What do you think about the [Bitcoin VAT ruling]( and the recent [EU controls proposal](
@_date: 2015-11-18 14:39:46
Actually your integration with Kraken makes the decision easier

For airbnb - many of them are "fake" - ie they are listed but are not available and not rented.

Similar issues - they told me they have a backlog and their Luxembourg payment processor is asking for additional kyc info on clients. See below the issue seems to mostly with non US USD deposits via PayCash
