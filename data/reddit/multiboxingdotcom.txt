Unless I missed it, there is no code posted, no code repository, no any of that.   That won't really help :/

Same here :(

While you and I might agree on that, the severity and forensics of what has/is occurring needs to be impressed upon them with a priority of the highest level.
Oh, and upvote for you just because :)

Please post the letter that Paypal has sent you, as well as corresponding dates to your public notification of Bitcoin.
The community needs to understand the correlation of Paypal restrictions and Bitcoin.
For example, it is very easy for Paypal to "flag" a site due to their automation of looking for the word Bitcoin on a site, and then flagging the site for manual take-downs.
The community needs to gather all information and start building up records of this happening.  I have a feeling this is going to happen more and more.
This is especially important to me personally as I sell a product which does a great deal of Paypal transactions and I am also looking to accept Bitcoin.

I'm not trying to stir up drama, but rather, locate the truth about what occurred, what is being done to prevent it, and overall a public statement of acknowledgement.  
It doesn't take an economist to understand the massive amount of wealth transfer that can occur if situations like these are planned from any entity in advance.

The easiest way to answer is simply this:  Dimmdrive was built specifically for gamers, whereas none of our competitors are.
One such feature this can be seen is our direct Integration with Steam, the largest PC gaming distribution network in the world.  Dimmdrive auto detects Steam games and is configured with just a couple mouse clicks.  There are a lot of other features, but this one seems to resonate in a tremendous way to our customers.
Dimmdrive was also built to be extremely easy to use for PC Gamers with technical abilities of all levels.
Also note that PC Gamers constitute a market of between 100 to 300 million individuals world-wide.

Yea exactly.  It shouldn't be hard to code this by hand.  I just thought that there is a repository somewhere, or something linked already out there.   Maybe I'll be the first to do so... :)

I do appreciate that some of the processors/wallets have chosen to pay back the people who lost BTC.  What I don't appreciate is the ones who basically wash their hands clean of the incident and walk away.

Hey there!
First question:  RAM is always cleared when a PC powers down.  That being said, we've thought of that.  Dimmdrive automatically synchronizes files back to your normal hard drive in real time.  For example, lets say you change/save a game you are playing.  The moment you save that file, Dimmdrive synchronizes it back to your traditional hard drive.  So if your PC crashes/turns off/etc, nothing is lost!
Second question:  The overhead for a small investor isn't management.  While I would consider something potentially smaller than $50k, this project is definitely built in mind for the more serious and capable investor.
Thanks for the questions!
