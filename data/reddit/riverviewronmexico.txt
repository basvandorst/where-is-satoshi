incorrect. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:48:15
is it currently listed? i'm interested.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:51:43
physically backed by what?
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:01:22
thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:49:52
so did you actually sell them or no?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:46:15
wouldn't it be a single private key? lol. Regardless, it's not a physically backed ETF. Physically backed ETFs are physically backed by the asset the ETF tracks.

how do I know you're not making this up?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:00:06
What's the difference between a whale and a controller? So you would consider guys like J.L. Van Der Velde and Giancarlo Devasini who could hypothetically print tether and artificially increase the price of bitcoin/other coins to be "influencers" and not controllers?

what's the halving in 23 months?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:26:06
so are there no "controllers" in the crypto-realm?
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:07:36
wait you're saying there might be some form of corruption going on in the crypto-realm? **GASP**
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:10:25
doesn't affect how it's taxed.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:32:50
ignorance is bliss

The academic paper most of the articles refer to was published like a day ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:25:26
The burden of proof is on the taxpayer not the IRS. If you're being audited and say, "oh, I donated X amount of bitcoin here", then they'll request documentation that proves that. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:31:41
that's like saying there are $120 trillion pennies in circulation instead of $1.2 trillion dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:09:50


Exactly.. just like 21 million bitcoins = 2.1 quadrillion satoshis

kid? he's thirty fucking four
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:01:46
if he realized a gain, then yes he does. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:46:43
wait is this Pete? you're a legend. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:57:22
hey at least you'll be able to write off some losses this year. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:20:54
don't forget to pay the taxes on the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:34:56
still classified as property by the IRS. As such, this transaction/barter is taxable. 
FMV of services received - cost basis in property surrendered = your taxable income (or loss)
