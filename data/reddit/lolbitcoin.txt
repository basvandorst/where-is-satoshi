Run this against that drive. You may need to boot a live cd to do it though. Happy hunting!

lol. Not me.

You should still be able to use the python script.
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:35:58
Stop running an OS on that drive. It *could* still be intact.Every moment you continue running off that drive, you risk overwriting the data. Wait a moment, there was a python a script I found for situations like this. No really, turn off that computer now.

185+ BTC Not bad.

I have created to help you and others like you who would like hackers and pentesters to take a look at your website/product for fun and profit!
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:18:04
This is the list I use, I hope you don't mind they are referral links
[Coin Reaper](
[Bit Hits](
[Bit Visitor](
[Coin Tube](
[Free BTC](
I particularly like Free BTC, and coinvisitor.

Next time, as it says at the top, I am done taking requests for now. The next time I do this I should be able to take a longer list of requests. I need to sit and write a little code to help automate this.

Forgot a few good ones, check these out as well.

So close to zero that I don't even feel like math.
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:45:06
Your post did not go by unnoticed, I get it.

If anyone was interested, [here]( is a rather shitty photo of the solar rig. It's dark now (running off batteries) so a better photo will have to wait. I have 6 custom built solar panels, some toys to handle battery charging and discharging, and 2 deep cycle marine batteries (AGM). Once the batteries get charged, I have literally nothing to do with the power generated from the panels, it just goes to waste. So, I mine bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:43:58
Here are just a few, there are a ton of "free" bitcoin sites. Coinvisitor seems to be the slickest I have used.

I tried to do not really mechanical turk style, but more security related bitcoin bounty aggregate. More distilled than but it never really caught on.
I'd be interested in this well.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:59:32
Yeah, always looking for new faucets, what's the link?
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:29:37
No u! One hour is complete. Don't go spend it all in one place.
@_date: 2013-10-17 02:20:43
Glad to see someone else is moving this kind of idea forward.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:55:24
Here is my list of free bitcoin sites.
[Coin Reaper](
[Bit Hits](
[Bit Visitor](
[Coin Tube](
[Free BTC](
I really like coinvisitor, bitvisitor, and free.btc.pt.
Yes, these contain referral links.
@_date: 2013-08-25 23:32:42
Please check out @_date: 2013-04-15 02:48:53
Very very true. My intent is not to give people free money. [It's not about the money]( but rather to get more people over the edge and hopefully providing them with enough interest in bitcoin to mine on their own, or something equally as interesting.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:41:16
No worries man, don't worry about it. Check out the [bitcointip intro]( Easy breezy.
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:24:54
Don't get your hopes up, it's not going to be very much. Like pgrily said


@_date: 2013-04-21 22:22:54
If you are just such a website or content owner, you should check out a place where you can offer BTC bounties to hackers and pentesters to find and report (privately) bugs and vulnerabilities. &lt;/shameless plug&gt;
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:37:58
Not to be confused with btcto.com of course.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:21:37
Like I said on some other corner of the net:  soon someday maybe perhaps they will think about discussing the possibility of at some point begining the process of shipping.
@_date: 2013-06-01 00:52:48
It would be nice to be able to sort the page by the column name, sort by user name, sort by status, etc etc.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:50:15
I can mine on whichever pool you like,  just send me the pool address and the worker credentials. 
**edit** Spelling, and whooops!
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:30:13
Done with your hour. Taking a break for a bit. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:57:34
Here is my list:
[Coin Reaper](
[Bit Hits](
[Bit Visitor](
[Coin Tube](
[Free BTC](
Yes, they are referral links. I just found Free BTC (the last one) and this one looks to be the winner in my opinion!
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:58:21
Not in the least, this is for companies/websites that have called out for these tests. I have posted 5 targets, and the links to their respective "Proof of intent", postings by the websites or persons themselves asking for it. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:38:59
Well, here we are.  the new single case is shoebox sized.
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:52:09
Short answer? [You don't.]( Also, it's likely that IP is just a pivot point, not the actual point of origin. Welcome to paranoid bitcoin users land.
@_date: 2013-06-08 09:24:30
So, uh, I actually own a vending machine. It should be pretty doable. I'll post back later if I end up doing this.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:26:05
Solar or bust, your hour is up!
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:30:42
[lmgtfy]( is a top contender for sure. :-D
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:07:30
Done!
