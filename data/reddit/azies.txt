You mean you think you won't get thrown in jail for not paying taxes, or at the very least they'll take all your stuff.

Don't know how it works where you live, but in Denmark (where I'm from) your employer reports your income to the tax office, but even if they didn't (and which would be the case, if you were self-employed, or generate money other ways), if you were living in a house, getting food etc, I'm sure your government would ask you how you're paying all that, when you're reporting a 0 on your income. It being digital/crypto-currency doesn't really change anything.

With the rate Denmark is going, you could probably buy Denmark for a reasonable amount. You might have to be a shady US business, but I deem it possible! :x

Point is, the programmers suggests changes, we the community (miners) have to accept them, if the majority don't want them, they will not go through. Democracy.

I suspect it wasn't his first time being scammed.

Well if you can match these numbers, you could just find the date(s) where the number of bitcoins exceed the supposed number, should limit your scope significantly. 
Granted that it's a lot of data but definitely doable.

More like you blaming the $ (or whatever currency) you used to buy the gun.

And as a miner, you can choose to disregard unwanted changes.

Iirc even Slush's pool was attacked, and I would believe they know their bandwidth usage.

Would it not be possible to count all bitcoin in existence, and just see if that number matches how many there should be?

because not everything can be fixed by coding, and requires hardware to handle what you want to do. Obviously you want to do both, but one is certain, hardware will advance and rapidly.
10 years ago we reached 500GB disks, now we're at 8TB+. What do you think it will be in another 10 years?
@_date: 2015-08-21 16:09:15
Yeah, because in 2036 (or there abouts) we wont have access to bigger storage.

You could say an average of 1.44 blocks per day, but a block doesn't equal 1 btc. Right now a block is 25 btc, and halves about every 4 years.

Unless there's some EU overrule, Denmark has removed capital gains regarding Bitcoin, businesses excluded.

Well that worked, and quickly. Thanks!

Bought 19BTC recently (just before the 140-&gt;180$ jump). Looking to keep them as a long term investment.
