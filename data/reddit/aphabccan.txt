Guys. I heard Burnie Sandals would have given me free kollege if he got elected. Do you guys think he would've given us free bitcoin too? I think he would've given us all free bitcoin too and everyone in the world would be rich right now and we could've all sold our bitcoin and the world wouldn't have to work! Burnie Sandals 2020!

I will own bitcoin again as well. Have owned some for 4 years now.  This is just sick though. Sold out everything. Everyone popping in here has no idea what bitcoin is, throwing money at it talking about getting rich. They don't plan on doing anything with it other than holding and selling it. Yikes

Sell while you can everyone! Last opportunity

Definitely not. This chart looks nothing like Bitcoin 1 month and the description of the stages sounds nothing like I'm hearing in here

I'm not saying this the ultimate bubble that will end bitcoin but it is a bubble. I would expect it at $9k or so at the bottom. The only interesting variable here is futures trading tomorrow night. Otherwise it's your textbook bubble. I sold out of mine up about 1200%. The holders are brave beasts indeed. Pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered
