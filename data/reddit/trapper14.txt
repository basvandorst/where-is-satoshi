They can't actually rewind the blockchain. He's referencing in 2016 when there was a giant hack, they did a fork to ensure that investors could have an opportunity to get their money out of theDAO. The eth blockchain is too large now for there to be a generally agreed upon fork (see bitcoin cash) so splitting the network would be pointless.

Based on 88000 coins. If it was only 4083 then it isnt anywhere close to that.

Almost 60 million dollars. Wow. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:27:25
It was a mistake. If you were to go from 800$ to 60 million$ it would be a 70 000 000% increase. Ishhh

Not a great sign

Use jaxx or mycelium. I'm pretty sure blockchain is a online wallet

I do have a good understanding up public-private key cryptology I am just having trouble understanding the signatures. Thanks though!

So far.
Serious Brainpower with serious funding hasn't really been applied to the problem yet. 
Id say there's a good chance the EF will figure it out.

I mean people lost a lot of money but I made a killing riding it up from 0.0027 to 0.03...like, tens of thousands of dollars

They get DDOSd quite often I wouldn't be too worried.

Have you checked to see how many blocks have been mined in the last 30 mins? I've seen it occasionally take 50 minutes for a block to be mined. It's possible not many blocks have been mined since you broadcasted the transaction

Not really sure how this is a ETH style attack vector? ETH DoS attacks were caused by poorly priced opcodes. The DAO was a coding issue not directly related to ETH, and the recent chain divergence was a client bug, not a malicious attack.

Sometimes it takes 3-4 blocks for the transaction to get picked up by a miner and then on average 10 minutes for each subsequent confirmation after that.

It would have been smart to send those coins around 5-6 times then before selling them to people who are most likely going to sell them on the dark web

If satoshi is still alive and has access to his private keys a 1 million dollar bitcoin would make him the richest man on earth by a factor of 10. The world's first trillionaire.

Yes but the funds are much harder to anonymize compared to bitcoin, so the law has power to reverse the fraud.

One of the major downsides of bitcoin is that there is no fraud prevention. The bitfinex hack for example would be much less likely to happen to a bank because we would be able to see where exactly the money was sent, and just take it back.

Many exchanges offer corporate accounts that are able to trade hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. Otherwise, many large transactions are rumored to occur privately between two parties who do not want to largely decrease the price via a large transaction.
