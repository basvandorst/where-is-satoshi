The problem is not debt per se but the debt based system we live in. Much poeple have a hard time understanding this concept. A debt based monetary system means that money is created exclusively out of debts which means no debts = no money. Bitcoins are not created out of loans even if they can be loaned out.

And you can't stop the bitcoin protocol to process bitcoin transactions no matter how low or high the price is.

You didn't answer my question at all. What can I DO with it that I CAN'T with bitcoin? This fundamental question will be asked by the market sooner or later, if you can't answer it, that's your answer about the future of this altcoin.

1. Click on "import/export" tab
2. Click on "export unencrypted" on the left.
3. You'll see a text with something like this with your private key next to "priv": {"addr":"1GQfGVM39EVW7cnEeuXvi1zG21E2eMCKkg","priv":"**Aq8XiRuKVQEn66XfomrzSZwv2qCTBsLyCArSqE8yYH31**","created_time":0,"created_device_name":"javascript_web","created_device_version":"1.0"}
The private key is in bold in my example.

@_date: 2014-11-20 23:46:49

You forgot 16. global
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:45:04
Yeah, because one of the main advantages is that Bitcoin is international.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:33:55


Exactly. The blocksize limit the number of transaction that can be included in a block.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:28:01

This is actually a pretty good idea.

OpenBazaar should get out of beta somewhere in 2015.
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:31:53
If bitcoin continues to grow at this pace, bankers will become much more useless and threaten them to lose the power of creating unlimited amount of money out of thin air. They have no power to stop it and that’s why they are scared.

A bail in is when banks can take the money from their depositor directly to bail themselves instead of taking government’s money (bail-out). 
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:30:59
Banks create money exclusively out of debts which makes impossible to pay them back entirely enslaving the population to give them continuous interest on those debts. That's the very reason why there is so much economic problems.

I don't see any reason why sidechains would be somehow more centralized than any other altcoins. What would be the point of using an altcoin blockchain when you can use a sidechain with same functionalities but with better liquidity and network effect. There is none.

Indeed but that deflationary spiral is only true in a debt based economy. When I previously said that deflation is supposed to occurs to everything, this is true except for debts. Since the money we use is always a representation of a debt this lead to price fixing. When we are in a situation of deflation in a debt based economy, people can’t afford to decrease their wages because they have credit cards and mortgage to pay back, government can’t lower their taxes because of the debt and companies can’t afford to lower the cost of their products because they also hold debts. So when the economy is weak and people/companies or the government are afraid to contract more debt, the money supply shrink (because of previous debts being paid back) while the prices are merely fixed so the result is the economy is being chocked in a "deflation spiral".

Yes, if you delete, your wallet is gone. That's why you should create backups. Also, bitcoin core requires the whole blockchain and takes a lot of time to synchronize, you should use another wallet unless you want to contribute as a node on the network.

First thing you should do is to learn how to secure your bitcoins properly. You should also read about “cold storage”. Then get some pocket change worth of bitcoins and play with it by making transfer from a wallet to another. Once you feel more comfortable you can then start gradually playing with bigger amount of money. Forget about mining for now, competition is too high so it’s not for noobs.

I know well bitcoin.org thanks but it is just an information website that has no relation to the protocol and the github project. The people running this website are no way any kind of "head". You are clueless on how open source projects work right? You should educate yourself on that matter.


I just tried and it is. Thanks for caring though. 


Miners don't make money out of it since a long time now. Most miners can't do their math properly and are mining at a loss but this is irrelevant since miners are being paid in *bitcoin*. 


Really? Colour me unfazed lol. 


[Nope.]( Do you want me to explain you how to read graphs? 


Nope again. This is not how mining works you should go buy a clue before making ignorant claims. Mining is a self adjusting process.


What are your source on this? This graph kind of prove you wrong 




LOL you are becoming really pathetic you know that? That chart is related to mining cost operations. Nothing to do with users transaction cost. 


Nope. Again, the system is self adjusting. 


Pretty much like any other market no? Since I'm a buyer, am I at my own mercy? lol




Errr you are at the mercy of banks that process your transaction. Are you trying to make a point here? 


Are you telling me that you know some markets that are not being manipulated? Which ones??
My bitcoins are safely held in cold storage and split wallets safe from hackers. Thanks for caring.  


Not free but much much cheaper ;)


If is was less efficient I won't be using it. Again, thank you for caring. 


Nope. I use mixing services. Thank you for caring about my privacy. 


Yup that's why I putted my bitcoins into cold storage and split wallets. But this is money I don't really care about either way. 


I don't mind because I am very aware that I'm using a beta system with no guarantees. Bitcoin has some level of risks that I am very comfortable to take. That's exactly why I'm using my recreational money. You, on the opposite, seem very very very afraid to take risks. Do you need your mama to cross the street? :)


Cool story bro. In the end, I enjoy using bitcoin MUCH more than using any banks. I'm sorry if it makes you angry :(

The 6 last years period is enough to show us that this system has clearly became unsustainable and that nothing is going to get better if the money creation process is not fundamentally changed. Past indicator performance are are not indicators of future performance. So saying that is has done well in the last 100 years is not a good argument to say it will continue to go well in the future.

Do you consider a *public* ledger to be anonymous? Also, I was not aware that privacy was a crime.


That's a problem that needs to be addressed.

No, 2FA is also different from BIP0038 and brain wallet. 
1. BIP0038 is a private key encrypted with a password. So you need the key AND the password.
2. Brainwallet consist of a passphase that is used as a private key root. You can retrieve your private key only by using the passphrase. (Not very secure unless you have a very long and very good passphrase using numbers and CAP). 
3. 2FA (two factor authentication) is a wallet that need authorization from another device you control to send the bitcoins. i.e. your phone by sms or your email.

No because all money is tied to debts that are not deflationary. The results is that people can't afford to lower their salaries or the price of their houses because their mortgages or their credit card balance will not decrease.

Well I do think the actual inflation rate, even if small, still have some effect at those rates. New buyers need to support 3600 * 600$ = 2,160,000$ each days just to maintain the price which I think is not negligible.

No they can’t. Even if they have international banks, they must comply on foreign banking legislation which are not under their authority.

Someone acquiring more than 51% of the total hashrate have the ability to validate double spending on the network.  There is no real incentive for that pool to undermine the network and screw their entire business model but Bitcoin wants to be a trustless payment system so having a mining pool with more than 51% of the total hashrate requires us to trust that pool and therefore bitcoin is not a real trustless system anymore.

It's not a gamble because you can analyse and *predict* where the market will go depending on current events. It is a high risk investment because those risks make these *predictions* hard to be accurate. Predictions are impossible in gambling from an event to another. If you don't try to analyse and predict the market then yes, you can consider it as a gamble.

Deflation in a debt based currency results in a shrink of the monetary base which is very different than deflation in a non debt based currency AKA gold or bitcoin which results as an increase of the purchasing power of that said currency.

The difference is that when the work is done, its done and you're not continued being paid for doing nothing, like any other industry.

I understand what you mean but this situation is not inherent to bitcoin. Financial institutions facilitate fiat/bitcoin interactions which is very useful but not mandatory. Even if no financial institution would use bitcoin, you CAN still use it in a closed economy.

You can use coinbase as your wallet but keep in mind that coinbase is holding your bitcoins. If you want to be in control of your bitcoins then transfer them to Hive. For security measure you should make proper backups and use strong passwords.

"Other ways of creating and destroying deposits
Just as taking out a new loan creates money, the repayment of
bank loans destroys money.(3) For example, suppose a
consumer has spent money in the supermarket throughout the
month by using a credit card. Each purchase made using the credit card will have increased the outstanding loans on the
consumer’s balance sheet and the deposits on the
supermarket’s balance sheet (in a similar way to that shown in
Figure 1). If the consumer were then to pay their credit card bill in full at the end of the month, its bank would reduce the
amount of deposits in the consumer’s account by the value of
the credit card bill, thus destroying all of the newly created

@_date: 2014-09-29 00:10:49
Pyramid 101? Pyramid scheme does have a head and does collapse when the base stop expanding. Can you point me the head of bitcoin? If bitcoin's base is shrinking then the price does go down but the whole system continues to work on. You think bitcoin isn't free? Then who exactly can stop me from sending funds to someone else? The government? Bitcoin related corporations? How?
You have very biased conceptions of what free and decentralized mean. 
I consider myself as a real market participant rather than a speculator because I personally use bitcoin to buy stuff online. I'm using it because I just hate the pull process of credit cards, giving my personal info online, the hassle of getting your cash back when your CC info has been stolen (yes it happened to me once and it has been a nightmare)  and the fact that credit cards aren't global. The bitcoins I hold are only for convenience purpose and it is money that I don't mind if it fluctuates. Am I being manipulated? How? By who? Who is pulling strings to my disadvantages? How does it affects me? Should I stop using it because it makes you mad? Why speculators that speculate on the fact that there will be more people like me using this technology as a tool in the future should be considered as the most dumbest people on the planet? Maybe they are right, maybe they are wrong but that's what speculation is all about.

There is the network fee that is set at .0001 btc by default (for now). If you set up lower fee it may take longer to confirm. You should always put a fee even if very small otherwise there is chances that your transaction will never get confirmations (unlikely though but may take very long time). One thing you need to understand is that no bitcoins are stored in your computer. All bitcoins are stored in the distributed ledger (blockchain) within the network (also the reason why bitcoin core need to synchronize each time you open it). What is stored in your computer is your private key (contained in the wallet.dat file which is what you can backup) that gives you access to spend your bitcoin from your address to another. Thin wallets like electrum doesn't require to download and synchronize the blockchain in your computer.

It's not a random thread, it shows from coinmarketcap.com that they grew the supply by 300% overnight. Just like that. 


Yes. 


I don't trust the miners neither but I don't have to. Do you think some miners didn't tried to change that limit the first time? It's not in the best interest of miners to mine infinite amount of worthless bitcoins that everyone will dumb in the market switching to the original scarce version of the blockchain.

The main advantage I see at the moment is that you don't have to buy bitcoins each time you want to make a purchase. You can buy a bulk amount of bitcoins and send them to a bitreserve account ready to be used in the future. The second use case I see in the future is those buying and selling stuff on decentralized marketplaces like OpenBazaar will be able to do business in bitcoin only using bitreserve as an edge against volatility.

option is to grant the IMF more direct control over Bitcoin by granting it and other digital currencies quasi membership status.

Bitcoin is a fascinating and ingenious technology, but most promoters are mindful of neither the monetary nor the tax issues. For all practical purposes IRS regulations issued in March preclude bitcoins from being used as an alternative currency.
The IRS treats bitcoins as property. The result is that bitcoin transactions trigger a taxable event. Buyers incur a tax liability for the difference in dollars between what they paid for a bitcoin when they acquired it and the dollar value attributed to the bitcoin when they spend it. Sellers of course are subject to a tax based on the dollar value of the bitcoins they receive for a good or service.
Enlarge Image
A Bitcoin sign is seen in a window Reuters
To comply with these tax regulations, buyers and sellers must log all bitcoin transactions and report them at tax time. For transactions that require future payment, buyers and sellers undertake an exchange-rate risk involving the dollar value of bitcoins. This will greatly reduce, or perhaps eliminate entirely, using bitcoins for settling future payments, which is the principal use of money.
Some bitcoin zealots reject the effect of triggering taxable events on the theory that bitcoin transactions are anonymous. That is arguable. What is not arguable is that one who doesn't report a taxable bitcoin gain is guilty of tax fraud, which is a felony.
In other words, the future of bitcoins depends on users willing to log all transactions, report them at tax time, and pay a tax or to engage in tax fraud. As soon as one of them ends up in prison, that will be the end of it.
Why bitcoins to begin with? We already have a virtual currency, the dollar, which has the purported benefit of being the world's "reserve currency."
Some people see a problem because dollars can be created at the whim of the Federal Reserve, and as former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan once put it, "without limit." This depreciates the purchasing power of dollars saved or promised for future payment, such as pensions. At least the quantity of bitcoins is supposedly limited by the mathematical algorithm that creates them. As an interesting aside, the bitcoin folks call the creation process "mining," an allusion to real money.
Bitcoin supporters understand that dollars are no longer money in the classical sense, i.e., something that has a unit of dimension defined in the physical world, as Sir Isaac Newton put it circa 1699 when he was England's Warden of the Mint. With neither debate nor anyone voting for it, the dollar has been transmogrified into an ethereal concept of money without any tie to the physical world, created out of nothing, and forced into circulation with legal tender laws.
As Australian comedian Michael Connell so brilliantly put it, what we used to call money has been transformed into "the idea of money." Mr. Connell's metaphor is that it's like playing musical chairs, but instead of chairs there is the "idea of chairs." It is absurd.
This brings to mind a related issue: U.S. Gold and Silver Eagles, which are legal tender for their face amounts under Title 31 of the United States Code. Yet as with bitcoins, the IRS arbitrarily treats these coins not as currency but as property, thereby preventing their use as money.
Consider: If you pay your taxes with a $50 Gold Eagle, you get credit for $50. No mystery there. However, if you spend a $50 Gold Eagle (or a $1 Silver Eagle), you trigger a taxable event on the difference between what you paid for the Gold Eagle and the market value of the gold in the coin when you spend it. Two recent cases challenging the IRS on this matter went up to the Supreme Court, but the court declined to hear the cases.
It is thanks to the IRS that no one uses so-called gold clauses, which would give creditors the right to demand Gold Eagles as payment in contracts. In other words, IRS policy that has no statutory authorization has rendered inoperative gold clause legislation passed by Congress in 1977.
Bitcoins have neither the advantage of being legal tender nor laws enabling their use. Folks who are accumulating bitcoins should take note.

If it generates the right public key the problem is on blockchain side so you can use electrum or multibit client and import your private key directly there. If it doesn't generating the right public key it means your private key has been compromised somehow.

Bitcoin scarcity and hoarding is not a problem because they are highly divisible so we will never run out of bitcoins (in comparison to gold that has a physical and practical limit to divide it.) If you can divide the number 1 infinitely it means the number 1 hold infinite amount of liquidity. There is always enough of the pie to use it. 
Also I don't see wealth inequality as a problem because people who takes greater risk with their investment of time and money building companies and hard work to bring tools to the market should be rewarded more than those doing nothing, taking no risk and whining about everything. The problem is not how much wealth do you have but more how you acquired it. If you acquired a lot of wealth honestly or by just by being lucky I don't see any problem about that as long you didn't stole it from someone else.

No one really knows. Since the total amount of bitcoins are limited to 21M, most people here think bitcoin's value will go up over time with adoption growing up. Right now there is more people speculating on the price than people using it as a currency so this results in a lot of volatility.

Online wallets are very convenient but you need to trust the provider for holding your money. It means that if they are dishonest they can steal your money or if they got hacked, you also lose your bitcoins (which happened a lot of time in the past). For these reason you should never put any amount of bitcoin you can afford to lose in an online wallet.

The purchasing power of wages remain the same because not only the wages decrease but also the cost of everything else. When there is deflation, everything should deflate (just like inflation).

It's a good thing because it means it can't be stolen from you. Unlike USD you hold in your bank account can be stolen through inflation to those (unelected) who print it at will and largely abuse of that power.

Are you telling me that the market is impossible to analyse?! That is pure non-sense just like that piece of paper you are talking about. It’s totally the opposite. The market price is correlated to a LOT of things which is why it is hard to analyse accurately. It is correlated to event based speculation / market sentiments / direct usage etc etc. Read more about multivariate linear regression which is used for that kind of analysis.

Bitcoin works as a pair of key. One is public and used to receive payment and another one is private which is used to sign a transaction from that respective public key. Now that private key is just a string of letters and numbers and devices like trezor and bitstash keep your private key in an external hardware. That device allows only signatures signed from the private key to leave the device and go in the internet. That way it is almost impossible for a hacker to access the private key stored in the device.

Currency is not only about network effect but there is also a great portion of trust. In no way bitcoin 2.0 can build a network effect faster than bitcoin is doing right now because of the trust factor. Trust can only be gained over time by showing resilience over all sort of shocks and attacks on both technical and social aspects. Bitcoin 2.0 or any other type of alternate money will need to go through the same process.

Let's put it simply. Mastercard is lobbying against bitcoin because they are fucked and they don't know what else they can do to compete with a worldwide distributed currency outside the reach of their control which is open source technology no less. This technology is driven by a distrust on banking and financial systems at large so a MastercardCoin would be one of the most epic cryptocoin failure by design and they sure know it. 
You claim that they can use their 1B $ pocket change to do a 51% attack. Problem is, they are way too greedy and fearful to risk even their pocket change into that kind of risky operation so they'll stick with the only thing left they can still do: lobbying.

I'm trading bitcoins since their $5. I won't show you my stash as it would be too complicated and I have nothing to prove. If I can give you an advice is to not hold all your coins in the same place *specially* on a blockchain wallet.

I know but adding a new pool is not a solution at all.

If bitcoin can be used to force transparency at those who rob us at the top I am all for it but privacy is still a basic human right. I don't want to world to know that I bought a 15 inches mumbo jumbo dildo. Transparency for OUR democratic governments and privacy for the people. That's how I see it.

I've watched the first 1h30 and basically the senators was being educated about bitcoin. They also focused a lot on the VAT taxation over bitcoin being a bad thing and wrongly categorize its usage. Senators seemed to agree and are seeking for better ways to fit it in the legal framework. Experts suggest to categorize it as a currency instead of commodity.

Of course but who's going to trust this? Centralized currency always lead to abuse and lack of trust which is a real problem to attract people building infrastructure on top of it. These blockchains will be not better than all of these 500 existing altcoins.

Yes. All bitcoins are stored in the blockchain which is basically a public and distributed ledger that indicate which public key owns how many bitcoins and you need that private key to reattribute a new public key to those bitcoins. This is basically how bitcoin transactions work.


Also correct.

I'll reply with this: how this is a bad thing? As I said, bitcoin only stops people from stealing trough money creation, it doesn't stop people for doing bad things with their money and money itself is not a solution for that. Money is just a tool which you can do both: good and bad things. Just like you can with a hammer, a knife of a gun. This is a human problem and you won't find a solution through the tool they use. Someone with a lot of bitcoin for example can do a lot of goods or a lot of bad but he can do it once while he is spending it. The power that be is sticking in place no matter what.

Well the point is that the crypto that receive the most investment will be the winner. Period. Bitcoin has received about 100M$ on infrastructures investment only in early 2014 and other cryptos pretty much about... 0. So I am where the money flows and bitcoin is by far the winner up to date.

Basically you have different fiat denominated accounts as well as a bitcoin account. If you send bitcoins to a fiat account, they sell your bitcoins and hold fiat for you. When you spend those bitcoins from that account, they reverse the process by buying back your bitcoins with the fiat before sending out the bitcoins.

One thing you need to understand is that bitcoin is disruptive. Big and powerful institutions hate disruption so don’t expect anyone depending on these institutions be anyhow positive about it. You need to trust yourself for what you can understand from it, period.

As a Canadian, I couldn't care less what the IRS think bitcoin is or is not. Their opinion is not mine.

[The graph you showed](  demonstrate a clear increase of trading volume after each bubbles because after each bubbles the bitcoin value stabilized higher than it was previously allowing a bigger market cap.

There are a few ways you can buy bitcoins. The most common is to buy them in an online exchange depending of which country you live. You can find some listed here 


Bitcoins are stored in a public key which is your "bitcoin account" and are accessed by using a private key corresponding to that public key. Wallets manage all these keys for you and make it easy to use. A list of wallets can be found here 
Take some time reading about how these wallets operates. You should also take a look at paper wallets. 


It all depends on which wallet you use and if you trust yourself more than a third party to hold your bitcoins by using a desktop wallet or a web wallet. You should always use passwords and two factor authentications. 
Also, you should first try with small amounts of money to get comfortable at transferring and storing bitcoins before putting any substantial money in it. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:46:23

Better and more reliable exchanges that won't mess with other people's money by doing the same mistakes. The first generation of bitcoin exchanges and businesses was made up by amateur and teens in their mom's basement so that was to be expected. That's part of the evolution. Maturity comes by learning form mistakes and bitcoin is still a young teen currency.

There are several exchanges where you can sell them all at once. Coinbase or bitfinex. Bitfinex has the largest liquidity.

Ask them 
There is nothing to stop banks to adopt such policies. Deposit ratio are only there to put some limits and are in any ways *required* for banks to create money out of loans like if it was any kind of unbreakable natural laws.

Do you really expect something to take off without the infrastructure needed to be put in place? How?
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:17:02


I'll go further than this, without any single party, nothing has value. Which prove my point that nothing can have intrinsic value. 


You're confusing definitions and theories here. The Wikipedia article you pointed me was a *theory* and yes, you can absolutely disprove any theory because by definition a theory is something unproven.


I think the exact opposite. Without any government interventions and bad policies it makes it a MUCH better currency. Are you telling me here that the first ever programmable cash that you can send instantly and frictionless through internet is wost than gold as a medium of exchange?! If gold is soo useful and efficient as a medium of exchange, when was the last time you use it as such?

It depends. You never should leave more money in a online wallet than you would put cash in you pocket. Offline / paper wallets are recommended for larger amounts. I personally use mycelium app for day 2 day transactions. Otherwise Electrum is a good desktop wallet too.

I'm reading this place and the forum for more than 2 years now but you still didn't answered to my question. 


Sure and that's why I'm using 2 type of currency instead of only one. I use the Canadian dollar when dealing with the government because I have no choice but I do think it is a very bad currency. That's why using bitcoin as much as I can as a second currency because I trust maths more than any other human institution and also because it offers me more features than CAD does.

There is no risk associated with price volatility because once the payment is done in bitcoin, they are automatically converted in fiat and deposited in your bank account. In other word, you never hold these bitcoins so the price volatility risk is on the buyer side.

That 30K wall got eaten pretty fast at 300$ so that's why I consider Schiff's arguments pretty empty. Again, maybe Peter is right but I don't see anything in the market indicating this.

Simply because normal Joe is too much insecure to take care of his bitcoins by himself so there will be bitcoin banks to take care of it. The main difference is that bitcoin banks won't be able to create money out of thin air through fractional reserve because it won't make any sense to customers to trade with bitcoin banks note. Bitcoin banks will act as optional security and financial services. Here an overview of the first bitcoin bank coming up in Cyprus at the end of February.

Mining rigs need to mine on a node either yours or on some mining pool node. These device doesn’t mine bitcoins but are basically running bitcoin core on a stand-alone device. If you plug your mining rig on this device, then you become a solo miner, mining on your bitnode instead of using a computer with bitcoin core on it. You need a node to mine but you don't need to mine to run a node.

New investors in Coinbase include The New York Stock Exchange.
Coinbase has raised $75 million in Series C funding, in what is believed to be the largest-ever funding round for a Bitcoin-related company.
DFJ Growth led the round, and was joined by The New York Stock Exchange, USAA, BBVA (Spain), NTT Docomo (Japan), Valar Capital, Vikram Pandit, Tom Glocer and Carlos Rodriguez Pastor. Returning investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Reddit Capital and Union Square Ventures. No word on valuation, although an earlier Re/Code report suggested that the deal would value Coinbase at around $400 million.
“Our original goal at the beginning of October was basically to raise around $50 million at a reasonable valuation,” says Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who declined to elaborate on ‘reasonable.’
Ehrsam adds that earlier rumors of a $100 million target at a significantly higher valuation were unfounded: “I don’t entirely know where all of that came from, except that people in the Bitcoin community try to over-hype everything because everyone has a stake in Bitcoin.”
Coinbase’s fundraising success — particularly from established financial groups like NYSE and BBVA — must be welcome news to that community, which has seen the value of Bitcoin erode by around 75% over the past year. Ehrsam says that the price decline did not affect investor interest, and optimistically suggests that it will ultimately improve the Bitcoin ecosystem by teaching important lessons about cyclicality and expense management to cryptocurrency miners.
“Price volatility isn’t good for certain uses of Bitcoin but, in that same time period, we went from 600,000 users to 2.1 million users, so it hasn’t caused the number of people signing up on our site to go down,” Ehrsam says.
Coinbase has now raised over $105 million in total VC funding since its 2012 formation. It currently employs around 100 people (50 of whom are full-time in the company’s San Francisco headquarters), and is hoping to soon roll out a new sort of site for outside developers who want to build apps on top of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-01-07 16:44:24


Sure as long as you trust that bank.


Not really. In this case, the bank is lending real asset like bitcoin or gold and they cannot lend more than they have in reserve. This model is a full reserve ratio and does not allow expansion of the money supply. In this case, banks does not create money out of debt from money they don't have. This model is more sound than fractional reserve lending and could be enforceable using the blockchain. 




I couldn't agree more.

It is still debt. The money you hold in your bank account considered as M1 is basically someone else's debt. 


Yes and I don't see why it is inevitable. A monetary base based on gold or bitcoin can't be expanded by loans. 


Hardly but not impossible. Why someone would accept a bitcoin credit note? The bitcoin networks wouldn't recognise this as legitimate.  


I wouldn't say it is the only difference but it is the main one.


My personal opinion is that debt as money is bad per se because it enslaves entire nations to private banks and lead inevitably to abuse and manipulation as you mentioned.

Yes.Yes it is. It is absolutely the solution to debt based currencies and all the fundamental flaws they have.

wtf is this. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:11:20
Don't get into something you don't understand. You should dip your toes first before doing anything stupid.

I saw a comment mentioning Bitcoin on a YouTube video explaining how this crooked banking system works. It then picked my curiosity and here I am. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:07:56
I'd take 10%.
5% in bitcoin and 5% in my bitreserve account. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:37:37
Because the sheeples are waiting for this.

I can't bribe using bitcoin?? Oh well...
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:33:28
I don't see this as a bad this at all. If it does something it can only improve the quality of what people post.

@_date: 2015-01-13 22:47:17
That's very relevant. In the spectrum where are still entrepreneurs who will understand how it works and monetize on ways to make it useful to those you don't give a damn on how it works. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:41:57
I just installed it. Seems legit. I wonder who is paying for this. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:30:05
It's not less sickening.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:10:38
We are talking about simple addition VS division concept. Either you use a pie, a horse, a dollar or a bitcoin. You are assuming that division is the same than addition, which is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:31:38
I heard they are trustworthy 
@_date: 2015-05-29 01:18:23
I'm using Xapo only for their debit card. I don't put there too much money as I trust more my paper wallets though I think they might be trust worthy but they still need to prove themselves.

Sure, everybody on the street from anywhere on the planet can tell you what bitcoin is and how the blockchain work. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:49:17
How's your shorts doing?

You can use  to generate paper wallets offline. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:08:34
Fist off you should stop replying to the changetip bot ;)
First you should create a another wallet. There are plenty of them  Desktop wallet, mobile phone wallet and web wallets. Use the bitcoins I sent you to send transaction from a wallet to another while you figure out how they work and which one is the best for you. Security is also a concern. You should do proper wallet backups, always use a password and 2 factor authentications for web wallets. I personally use Mycelium as a mobile wallet and electrum as a desktop wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:14:34
Ah my bad.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:23:36
Welcome and have fun! 3000 bits @_date: 2015-01-29 12:01:13


Do you have to ask permission to use Bitcoin? Can someone stop you? Can someone stop you to send or receive any amount to any country in the world? How is it not freedom?


Good luck sending gold over the internet instantly and cheaply.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:01:43


By citizen you mean the top 1% bank owners? You're right. Because the average citizen is also heavily in debts and are in no ways real contributors as lenders. Pretending so is just absurd. 


Totally irrelevant. 


Again to ensure the government is paying interest to that top 1% through perpetual interests. If you never wondered why wealth inequalities are ever increasing and why the middle class is slowly disappearing in a "free market" environment, now you know.  


I know exactly wtf I'm talking about. Here some good read for you:

Well duh.

Ah yeah I always forget the USA is the center of the world.

I don't understand why Bill Gates associate himself with these crooks. It's questionable. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:43:08
And how does that make division the same thing than addition? You are really making no point here. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:58:32
They choose =/= democracy. We choose = democracy. That was my point.

You can decrypt your private keys directly from bitaddress from the "wallet details" tab. So you just have to right click on the bitaddress page and click "save as" so you have bitaddress on your device and you can run it offline anytime you want.

You can't compare bitcoin with pointless copycats.

Hard to tell at that point. Hopefully bitcoin will save the day.

So are any currency on the FOREX. Bitcoin will be stable when its usage as money will outpace its usage as a speculative asset. We are slowly getting there but that's not for tomorrow.

But you can't open order book where you ask for your own price. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:24:00
No. It means the protocol can break a bitcoin down to 8 decimals at the moment while in theory the protocol can be changed to add more divisibility if needed in the future. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:02:37
Yeah sure, the fact that more than a 100% of the country is liable to private banks is totally sane. This is very good to ensure a permanent pay off of interests because paying back the debts is just impossible. Make sense. You must be an economist.

bitreserve.org does just that. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:39:38
Yes I have one and its pretty neat. I had to ask again by email after a few months and they sent it right away. They still don't ship it the US as far as I know. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:02:20
Simply to focus more on the privacy aspect. Privacy is one of the lowest priority on the OB team at the moment. They admittedly told that they will try to push it that way to separate the legit stuff from the illegal stuff. You don't want your little sister to shop her barbies beside of coke.   
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:59:08

Geeez calm down. Did you had a bad day? Do you need someone to talk?
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:10:35
It's pretty slick. Your card is linked to your Xapo app in real time. Your bitcoins are debited instantly when you swipe your card in a POS. It is free if you use a card denominated either in USD, GBP or EUR. The card is international but there is a 3% fee if you use your card outside of these currencies zone i.e. I have a USD card but I'm using it in Canada so I pay the currency conversion fee.
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:41:52
Yeah sure it does work like that. Are you telling me it's not a problem?
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:32:46
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:48:35

No it's not right around the corner. Bitcoin is still beta 0.9.3. Maybe you want me to educate you some more? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:06:59
That suck. I also lost 1 BTC by sending to an old and wrong instawallet address. It was worth 20 buck at that time but I would still have that BTC...

That's also what I would do  to cheer me up if I had a miserable life with no friend and family. In some way, I have some pity for you :(
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:24:35
Bitcoin software needs to scale and handle more transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:40:29
Why don't you use the Xapo debit card instead? 
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:14:36
I understand that you don't understand simple math concepts. You're a lost case at this point.

Indeed but it doesn't make the situation better to ignore the absurdity of a national debt way above the GDP. People can ignore it all they want but shit gonna hits the fan sooner or latter. And this is no FUD but hard cold reality.

The real power that creates wealth illegalities are not wealthy people like Bill Gates but privately owned central banks which nobody knows who they really belongs to but have the power to create money out of debts to enslave populations and governments. One thing you need to understand is that creating money doesn't create wealth. Money is the representation of wealth, not wealth itself. So when someone has the ability to create money, he is literally re-attributing wealth of others to himself and this is theft. The only scenario that would be morally OK to give this power to someone would be to a democratic government own by the people. This has never been the case (expect of a brief moment of the USA history under the president Washington).
First, having a fixed number to represent wealth stops the power that be to steal the people. Secondly, having those numbers not being a representation of a debt breaks the loop of never ending debts of governments and its people. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 05:20:00

LOL @ what? Can you analyse charts?

Proof-of-announcement or GTFO

It means if the price of 1 bitcoin goes to $1M then 1 satoshi would worth $0.01. If the price goes higher then that it means there will be not enough satoshis for everyone and stay convenient as a medium of exchange so a fork will be required to break those satoshis even more.

Sure it is unless you can't analyse the anatomy of a bubble and market behaviours. From that perspective, any entry point is a gamble.

The Xapo debit card is better IMO. You need to load your E-Coins card each time and holding fiat in the card while the Xapo one is fully synchronized with your bitcoin wallet.

Buying bitcoins depend on where you live but can try circle.com or coinbase.com
The simplest and safest way to store bitcoins is on paper wallets and send bitcoins to the address generated. You can generate a pair of keys on  from an offline computer, print them out, make copies and put them in safe places. You can also go on "paper wallet" tab, BIP38 Encrypt and add a passphrse then click generate so you will need to enter the password when you'll redeem the bitcoins. 
You should make a try with small amounts just to be sure you understand what you are doing. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:39:18
Exactly. That's why I think mining will never really be centralized. It will be run be tons of idiot who can't do their math properly and think they will get rich easily. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:55:00
They explain it in [this video]( Basically they will use their bitcoin reserve to fill out accounts when the price drops and remove bitcoins from accounts if the prices goes up with contract terms. This will be optional though.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:48:22
You should just give it a try. It will open wide you eyes.

No, These are just assumptions which I don't believe to be true.

No but it is probably to hide himself from the power that be. People that tried previously to create other forms of digital cash ended in prison. Look at liberty reserve.


Yes, by moving his coins on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:29:09
Stock market has been artificially inflated by QE money and low interest rates. Now that QE is ending and the interest rates will rise expect a reversal on the stock market. That money will be destroyed (monetary contraction) and will go where it came from, nothing. Smart money know this and will sell at the top creating a panic reaction on the market.
 
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:02:57


The market disagree with this, obviously. It is now more scared about doing nothing than using a compromise. BitcoinXT is now a safeguard. If Bitcoin Core doesn't come up with a solution to scaling problems, when it starts to bloat and fees rise too high, all businesses that relies on transactions will naturally migrate to BitcoinXT. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:25:05
Yeah me too. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:39:36
If demand for bitcoins rise, the price will also have to rise to accommodate its usage. Also you can actually break them down to 8 decimals which is enough for the whole world economy so we won't run out of bitcoins anytime soon. 
It is the exact opposite of the dollar mechanism. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:21:16

@_date: 2015-08-15 07:00:00
The reason for this is people are getting deeper into debts to increase the money supply through fractional reserve which create inflation that doesn't keep pace with wages. My question for you, do you really think these trends can continue forever? 
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:52:37
Indeed. As a Canadian I am glad to held some bitcoins when the CAD dropped.  
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:39:55
I don't see why Satoshi would do anything bad to the market. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:03:53

@_date: 2015-08-13 19:28:09

No proof = no credibility. Period. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:42:51

Most governments and banks already knows they can't manipulate bitcoin and there is nothing they can do about it. That's the whole point the this technology.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.
Goldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology’s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.
Circle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.
The new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.
Goldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank’s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”
Circle said in a statement that the investment bank’s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm’s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.
The funding news coincides with Circle’s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.
Also joining the investment round were Circle’s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms’ individual contributions weren’t disclosed.
Goldman’s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.
Also, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin—its so-called “blockchain” digital ledger.
The strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm’s founding philosophy.
“We’ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview.
Dollar account holders’ funds will reside with Circle’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.
Unlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own “closed-loop” networks, Circle’s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm’s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.
Circle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba’s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent’s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.
It is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a “Superwallet” for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.
“The opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,” says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners—both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments with IDG.

considerable promise, making it possible for users to transfer value (or other information)
quickly, efficiently and securely, providing a permanent record of what has taken place, and
without the need for a trusted third party to oversee the process. 


protection is the right step to take at this stage, in order to address the risks identified but
without imposing a disproportionate regulatory burden on the industry. The government

They are relevant in comparison because capitulation is always characterized by a very high trading volume at a very low price.

Banks will have to cannibalise their market. It means they will make a lot of money but a lot less than what they actually do. It's kind of the point of removing the third party out of the equation.

Again, you need to see money as a language. The market won't take the hurdle to switch to another language even if there is a slightly better one. The incentive to switch from a protocol to another one must be huge and clear for everyone OR  slowly proves itself to be much better over time. But that's a possibility.

To hack bitcoin you'll have to change the blockchain and fool every one in the networks, that are all mutually and constantly checking themselves to make sure they all have the same version, that your version of the blockchain is the good one. The only way to do that is to overtake the network which is a 51% attack. It can be done by obtaining 51% of the hashing power of the network and then you can create the longest chain and openly fool everyone. However the attack is extremely costly and only theoretical so it makes more sense to use that hashing power to take the profits instead of openly fooling the network. This attack can only makes you openly spend bitcoins twice (double spend) and authorize it. It cannot steal your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:52:51
You will pay a flat $5 plus 3% conversion frees. I don't think your bank will notice it because it is done through cash advance.

Simply because the price rose much more than the real market usage because of short term speculation. Greed is a powerful sentiment in small and speculative markets. The actual post bubble price shows that the market grew 2-3 times in 1 1/2 year. Not 10 times in 2-3 months.

First, bitcoin is not a *product* per se so your logic is flawed.
1. Can you copy infrastructures and liquidity needed to make a currency works?
2. With mass adoption the price of product always FAILS because productivity of that said product increase to match demand. Since you can't increase the supply of bitcoin by increasing productivity your logic is flawed right here.
You really don't understand basic supply / demand laws don't you?

Halving happens on the blockchain and has nothing to do with Coinbase the company. 
Some people expect the price to rise because at the moment 3600 bitcoins per day (~$864000)  are hitting the market and need to be bought to sustain the current price. If the demand remain constant, the selling pressure will go down with the halving and the price should go up.

Nope, money is a *medium of exchange* to *exchange* products. 
1. So easy that every altcoins have the same liquidity and infrastructures than bitcoin as we talk now? hmmm. Care to explain why it's not the case actually if it's THAT easy? 
Money is not a product, it's a language used to vehicle information. I'll let you figure why copying languages is pointless.

Thing is, there is no point for litecoin to has demand because bitcoin is already there. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:24:24
Bitcoin is not ready for that sort of move. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:33:19
Chinese just woke up about bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:24:17
I learned about bitcoin in 2012 so.. meh. and you know what? tons of poeple out there are still don't know about bitcoin and they will regret it in the future. Bitcoin is still a very very good deal IMO. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:54:04
Fuck yeah, I can't wait to be able to buy back soon!
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:38:48
Awesome! I can't wait to listen this show!
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:10:11
It's helping because having opportunities to spend your bitcoin is also an incentive to hold more bitcoin. Plus, if more and more merchant are accepting bitcoin, less and less will want to turn them into fiat. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:21:02
My advice would be to buy 50% now and 50% if/when it’s gonna crash. I think it’s a fair bet. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:32:29
Buying/selling back and forth on an exchange doesn't appear on the blockchain when you speculate.

Yep, just like the FBI bitcoin address can be monitored. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:59:18
Thing is, the market does not really care about the mining process, only miners care and they are not the market but only a small part of the market.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:12:43
If you think that bitcoin is JUST a speculative asset it's because you really misunderstand this technology and its adoption curve.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:40:57
Is this service working in Canada?
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:04:14
You are all wrong. I really don't care about making money, my only interest is for killing the fractional banking system and bitcoin is THE tool to make it happen. Get lost. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:20:58
it requires consensus and such consensus will never happened

I hate banks too but for other reasons 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:53:49
Calm down people, I just made a test by purchasing something and I can confirm  that bitcoin still work as a currency just like it did before this announcement!
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:05:58
First purchase I ever made with bitcoin was on Black Friday last year. This is a very good opportunity for poeple to try to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:03:00
It's because they are from the stone age of money. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:33:35
Personally, I find them pretty funny 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:55:22
I'll be happy to just pisses them off in a response for their crappy attitude. I would not like to have unwanted attention coming from the government or the police force but coming from a private bank? meh. As far I as know, I'm a customer and they have no authority on me. People tend to forget that. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:08:28
Deflation feel soooooooooooo goood :D
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:22:39
I mean that the price will stabilize or at least will become less volatile when poeple will use bitcoin mostly for other purpose than pure speculation. Right now, this is the oposite. Most poeple using bitcoin are speculating on a small market which create huge swings in the exchange rate. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:44:03
adoption + scarcity madness

Are they listed on coinmap.org?

Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is an open source protocol and anyone can make its own analysis on it so no one really care if Satoshi is an alien chick or a 1000 years old dwarf because it is completely irrelevant to the system itself.

lol so true

Keep in mind to not invest more than you can afford to lose.

A lot of things can influence the market rate between different market. Basically, what explain the difference is a different ratio of buyer/seller from an exchange to another.

@_date: 2013-12-10 18:45:34
Maybe, but maybe not. If bitcoin goes mainstream, why should I still use a bank when I can do all transactions I want by my own? I don’t expect the banks to use bitcoin any time soon for that reason. Nobody can predict the future but I am sure of one thing: the corruption among the banking industries is at its highest level since banks exist and I have lost faith in their system forever. THAT is not gonna change. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:27:54
Will it stop inflation in china? I don't think so.

@_date: 2013-12-27 03:02:24
They only reason we switched to fiat is because paper is much more easy to carry than an heavy bag of gold. Therefore, creating fiat based on gold standard allowed banks for tremendous abuse in a way they even remove this standard and fiat is not backed by anything anymore and printed at will by greedy banksters creating huge misalocation of wealth.

Such a misleading title
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:52:16
Bitcoin does not create wealth but steal wealth from other fiat currencies which are 75% own by the 1% (banks and central banks), from debt based to non-debt based. Bitcoin is literally a redistribution of wealth and have definitely this potential of capital creation. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:05:24

Store of value. Better hold bitcoins for the next 20 years than fiat.

No it's not. It's speculation.

@_date: 2013-12-05 23:54:28
That is called speculation and most fails, yeah
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:11:10
If by definition a currency can be used as a store of value, I definitely don't see why it is not a good thing to use it as such. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:48:44
Fiat is the real scam 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:58:42
Ho well, same for Canada...
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:28:14
The key difference is that litecoin brings nothing new.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:35:24
I guess in the short term, those USD not used by countries like China can create quite a lot of inflation inside the US.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:49:19
1. I assume that you have downloaded the bitcoin-qt client which requires a lot of disk space because you need to download the whole blockchain which is the record of all bitcoin trasactions up-to-date. You should install this one instead  which is a thin client (wallet). 
2. Make sure to encrypt your wallet with a password. Be sure to remember it because if you lose your password, your bitcoins are lost forever. 
3. Make a backup of that wallet in case something go wrong with your computer.
4. Your wallet number is a string of number like this one: 1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty
5. Yes, you can buy fractions of a bitcoin. One bitcoin can be divided up to 0.00000001

Basically because in a debt base currency people/government need debt simply to have money. It's not the case with bitcoin. With bitcoin you replace debts with capital.

You should avoid all altcoins 
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:53:38
This will not work because of the only fact that mining is not a useful aspect of the currency and the end users dont care about that.

1. You can start with a wallet here
 or 
Make sure to put a strong passworld that you will remember and make proper backups of that wallet (with the password). 
2. To buy bitcoin it depend where you live. You can find a local reseller here 
or open an account in an exchange which you can find here  depending of your local currency.
3. Decentrilized mean that no one is in control but all the users together as a network.

Bitcoin will plummet when another type of much superior money will be created. Not before and it's not for tomorrow. Do you know that all fiat currencies in history have plummeted? It's just a mater of time for all of those in existence. Yes USD will plummet too and banks don't seem to care at all.

Where does it come from?
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:47:41
Then those miners will be able to do some double spending. Even is this very unprobable scenario would ever happen a fork can be made and the rest can go with the uncorrupted blockchain.

@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:39
Bad press yes but China is still in the game. They clearly said bitcoin was legal to use. Press was not that bad, this is why I see it as a correction too.

Never used it. I live in Canada.

I'd wish bitcoin can go back to some obscurity right now. It is getting way too much unwanted attention by governments and banks. Bitcoin is still not ready for this IMO.

Yeah he said that while the FED thinks they can create their own bitcoin so of course they think it is a good thing! You guys are wishful thinker, the FED clearly don't understand yet the threat bitcoin poses on them. Watch out their reaction when they will get it.

Yes and no, it's true that the Bank of Canada is own by the government but it does not make any profit. It just act as a regulatory agency for Canadian banks. The bonds issued by the government are bought in majority by the same big banks around the world. National bank of Canada (which is private) is the biggest owner of Quebec province debt. The game is bit different but it is not much better...

It is true only in a debt based economy (where money is all and only created out of debt). Bitcoin is not debt based so deflation in that situation does not lead to a depression.

There is a development team with a mailing list. Gavin Andresen is the developer orchestrating unofficially the whole thing. He is paid by the bitcoin foundation but bitcoin does not rely on him or this organisation at all since it is an open source software. This was made up to ease and accelerate the bitcoin software development. You can actually divide 1 bitcoin up to 0.00000001

Just go through all the advantages it offers as a payment system. Then just tell that the supply is limited but can be divided as needed. Never use the argument that the price will increase. Let them figure it out by themselves so it will sound less like a scam.

Nothing has intrinsic value, even gold. This concept does not stand at all. For something to be valuable it needs only 2 things: utility + scarcity. utility is very subjective from a person to another and from a situation to another. i.e. if you are left alone on a desert island where there is tons of gold. You will probably see little to no value to gold because you cannot use it for anything. Food will be much much more valuable for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:12:44

They are all copies of the bitcoin protocol with no real innovation plus a big lack of network effect. Unless a new altcoin will come up with new features than can't be added to the bitcoin protocol (maybe zerocoin), they are all doomed to stay a niche.

Quarkcoin? success? Where are the venture capitalist please? For me, price pumping is not a sign of success. Secondo, how mining is such better in quarkcoin since only 2% still be available to mine? Anyway the end user don't care about mining as much as I am. I never mined a single bitcoin. Quarkcoin is pointless to the market and the end user and venture capitalists know that, so don't put your expectation too high. When another altcoin will provide new features for the end user that bitcoin don't and can't have, let me know and I'll invest for sure. Meanwhile don't put too much effort on any pointless bitcoin plain copies that the market will reject. They are only full of miners mad that they can't mine bitcoin easily. I'm sorry but that's the whole point about scarcity so get over it and move along.

Chocking bitcoin/fiat gateways will not allow them to take control over bitcoin but will slow down its adoption for sure. They will always be in control of the fiat side, not the bitcoin side. On the other hand, I think  it will force bitcoin to bypass the current banking system in a way that they will be even less in control (because no fiat interaction at all).
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:34:22
I just replied you. With bitcoin you can replace debts by capital. If money is no longer debt based, you can reduce 95% of all debt in the society by capital. Why need debt if people have capital to buy a house directly?

It's frictionless money. You always control your money and never rely on banks. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:34:58
Awesome! I'll try to make it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:40:37
Thank you queen drama
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:44:03
What for the crash and buy more!
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:31:45
And sometime like in Cyprus they steal the money themselves directly from the bank accounts. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:53:45
Fuck this
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:07:09
Well, fiat and bitcoin are from two different paradigms for sure. No one can argue that. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:41:13
Nice! Too bad I'm not in Vancouver :/
I'd love to be paid in bitcoin :D
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:01:48
I can't beleive the fungibility of bitcoin is at the forefront. I'm completely against tainted coins!! I AM PREPARED TO FORK THE PROTOCOL IF ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENEDED!
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:00:42
Here it is 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:23:25
Doesn't looks like a scam to me... Seem pretty darn serious
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:53:14
What's the point of holding something until you die without ever making any use of it?
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:22:40
Yeah. Technically you can, but you won't be able to compete at all 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:52:18
Freedom has a cost. Which is just waiting the free market to come up with competition.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:39:58
Quark guys are trying to highjack this post lol.
Hilarious 
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:42:10
The market cap is far from meaningless within the bitcoin economy. A greater market cap means a greater potential for commerce inside the bitcoin economy itself. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:40:49
If one day I want to use bitcoin everywhere I go, yes, I need to talk about it. It won't happen by itself. You'll have to accept that people want to make it more useful so more accepted. People are working to make that happen and it won't stop ay time soon. Get over it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:55:56
yeah, sadly
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:41:15

And laws can be approved overnight....
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:41:22
It would change a fundamentally corrupted system to a non corrupted one. People itself will always be corrupted, I agree.

Your analysis didn't take in consideration people holding their coins in an exchange. You can't see it in the blockchain...

The Chinese want to get rid of the petrodollar and now this. The US dollar is in deep shit these days. I hope the US citizens will wake up to the fact that bitcoin is a very good alternative otherwise they are heading into real economic troubles….
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:06:39

@_date: 2013-11-27 03:27:16
I called them when they where in beta. Now it seems they are way too overloaded. Send them a ticked. it worked well last time I did it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:39:11
Care to tell us who owns the major US and European banks and what is the history of banking Mr. Genius? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:29:33
My guess is that it's both. Legitimate growth amplified with a bubble. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:38:49
Hard to read... was it good?

Don't forget to encrypt and backup your wallet
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:44:23
Yes but android is not a disruptive technology that will face huge resistance from the most powerful industries around, banks. Bitcoin requires way more trust as a system for the general public than any other technology around because bitcoin is money and money requires trust. You don't gain trust without passing the "time" test and getting through a lot of uncertainties. You and I are not afraid of taking risks. Normal Joe and my grandma hate risks
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:22:43
You can also look at paper wallets for long term / offline  storage.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:10:03
Satoshi was a genius. Period. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:25:20
It depends where. In canada virtex is the only exchange so it will likely being shut down with all the bitcoins. No dump could even occur. Idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:25:31
I hope this will work. It will be the second governemental usage of bitcoin after the FBI.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:45:12
The second one was in Istanbul airport. This one is the third one :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:58:33

The crowd is growing so I guess noise on reddit has to be expected. I won't complain about it though because that kind of affluence is only good for bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-22 14:27:58
It blows my mind o_O
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:20:53
Right. That banker also said China will start purchasing oil from Russia with yuans instead of dollars.
@_date: 2013-10-12 04:02:41

6. If you are in Vancouver, there is an ATM
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:00:39
Problem is, this is not the last bubble. Bitcoin is becoming less volatile so we cannot expect that history repeat itself exacly the same way. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:35:40
Is that real?!
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:13:25
Apparently, someone came up with a solution using coinbase in canada 
Otherwise you can use 
 or  or the ATM if you live at vancouver
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:15:05
Would be awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:25:17
Nice idea. I might try this once.

Tell him to list them all on coinmap.org
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:57:02
Indeed but try to explain that to a bank hehe
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:53:19
Great job guys. I hope you will integrate interact for national bank any time soon!
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:56:08
Bitcoin prices are not based on a strong market. It is still very speculative so when the Chinese will start cashing out. Get prepared for the massive crash. Bitcoin is NOT going mainstream at the moment simply because bitcoin is still not ready to go mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:05:09
That's why Satoshi put this message in the genesis block "chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:47:30
Do you deal with bitcoin addiction? :p
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:53:23
Maybe this site can help you
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:18:51
I don't give a shit neither. I'm wise enough to not depend on them and I keep a minimal amount of money in it. If they want to freeze it, I'll just laugh and move around. If you want to be a bank whore that is your choice but definitely not mine.
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:37:13
Yes but I think only the highest level of the government is really tied to the FED. Right now, they are way above the sky to realise what's happening right under their nose. They are much more concerned about how to steal oil from Iran than to even bother with bitcoin. Too bad for them and good for us. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:07:45
I believe in myself and Greenspan is an old idiot defending a system from the stone age.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:56:05
I'm not hoping anything. The dollar WILL collapse and wishful thinking won't save anybody. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:14:46
and what if we are in fact in the first S chart instead of a bubble?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:37:57
They are banned from all the banks in USA. No joke. Pretty hard to do some business with those conditions...
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:54:59

You mean the FED?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:18:40
Bitcoin will rise bubble after bubble until the market becomes bigger than speculators. Expect that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:13:28
Well, bitcoin is open source so the best way is to look at the code itself by yourself and make your own analysis.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:19:04
Volatility is fun as hell :D but yeah, time and adoption is the only way out. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:50:27
That's also my thought
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:32:25
Quote: " Should
bitcoin become widely accepted, it is un-likely that it will remain free of government intervention, if only because the governance of the bitcoin code and network is opaque and vulnerable. That said, it represents a remarkable conceptual and technical achievement, which may well be used by existing financial institutions (which could issue their own bitcoins) or even by governments themselves." 
LOL what a bunch of lamers
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:19:18
It that case you shouldn't be idiot enough to confuse bitcoin and fiat.

Nice one. Love it. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 03:36:22
Thing is, we cannot live on our means in a debt based economy without collapsing the whole system. The only way to get out of this is to change profoundly the money creation process.

@_date: 2013-11-14 17:56:52
There is coingig
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:37:04
This is part of the protocol and is therefore a global concensus. In order to change this you need the majority of users / miners to update their software with the new rules. Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:08:07
No. Litecoin is just a copy that brings nothing useful for the market. Don't expect it to take off as much as bitcoin. There is no point. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:17:21
Should be. Both addresses shouldn't be compatible.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:28:59
Litecoin brings nothing new to the market so the market will find it pointless. There is no doubt about this. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:31:06
Really?? when is the last time you bought something with gold? Gold is not a medium of exchange anymore from a few decades ago. You cannot make generalities with exceptions like the link you just provided.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:23:15
Welcome in this exciting new world :)
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:15:13
Of course but I don't see why it will create any chaos. I don't see any problem with wealth redistribution. I think it will solve a lot of promblems caused by poverty.

In a deflationary environment (where money doesn't represent any debt) there is no need for credit. People will Just use capital like they did a few thousand years ago with gold. Rome was not built on credit lol

Is Brazil will lead the next rally?
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:49:51
OK so here is the Quark scheme for the noobs: 
1. Set a very high number of total coins.
2. A few people mined 95% of all quarks in a very short period of time.
3. Agreement among the early miners to hold on their coins expect a very few for trading on the market.
4. Give quarks to people with some decent audience (Bill Still + Max Keiser) so they can promote it.
5. Resulting a high number of buyer on the market + very few coins available for trading = high market prices in a short period of time.
6. High market prices X total mined coins (which 95% held by a small group of people) = super artificially high market capitalization. 
7. Noobs look on coinmarketcap.com and say "WOW quark is very promising!"
8. Rinse and repeat
9. Dump and profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:53:50
Just do it. When more and more people will do it, the others will then adapt. The market will adjust itself.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:53:06
You should take a look at how banks work behind the scene...
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:24:31
and don't forget Canada!
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:43:43
Yea it's crazy because banks suck...
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:02:07
Yeah but you don't need to trust a phone as much as a payment system. What risk there are for a user to use a bad phone? It's not like your gonna put all your live savings into that phone....
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:10:12
I don't give a shit. I'm Canadian.
(will be a good opportunity to buy though)
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:20:35
Be sure that if bitcoin will become illegal, you can say goodbye to some exchanges, goodbye to the ATMs and goodbye to all the nice way to acquires them. So yeah, the supply is going DOWN you fucking idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:43:31
Don't use the word bitcoin with bankers. They seems to be afraid of it... 
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:44:47
FYI the dollar is not backed by any precious metal anymore for almost 50 years ago when Nixon removed the gold standard. The dollar as we know it today is just a global concensus that we can use it as a medium of exchange and it is nothing more than paper and numbers. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:07:30
Fuck fiat
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:46:11
Stop whining. I suggest you to look at the definition of whining.

What are the main purposes of namecoin? I just don't get it. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:53:20
No. It will only force bitcoin to move around faster than expected.

It is because you are too stupid to understand that I meant the user INTERFACES need to be stupid proof for any apps to succeed. You are so stupid it blows my mind you can actually use bitcoin.

Yep. When people are losing all objectivity, this is when you know we are in a bubble.

And they are calling themselves money experts. How pathetic.

Who care about this troll?!

Warn you beloved one. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:26:19
I'm 100% into this. You should setup a website to get started.

Kudos to Jeff Berwick for doing an EXCELENT PR exercice promoting bitcoin an speaking the truth. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:16:54
The governmnent will only prove how draconic they are. People will be outrage.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:07:32
indeed 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:01:06
In prohibition times the price goes UP because the supply goes DOWN. Same with bitcoin. Where do you get bitcoins if the exchanges can't operate? Does the demand will go down? Maybe but not entirely. This is hard to say.

Bitcoin - A Primer for Policy Maker
" Finally, even if the United States prohibited the use of Bitcoin, it is likely that many other countries would not, recognizing the technology’s many potential benefits. The Finnish central bank, for example, has stated that the digital currency is not illegal,and as a result many Finnish businesses have begun to accept bitcoins. By prohibiting Bitcoin use, the United States could put itself at an international competitive disadvantage in the development and use of what may be the next-generation payments system."

Tight your seat belt for the bumpy ride :)

While users are anonymous (not really), corrupting the bitcoin system would be really hard because it is fully transparent and monitored by thousands of people. Everyone is then responsible to make sure the system has not been compromised. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:30:33
That statement just blew my mind
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:27:10
It's based on free market supply/demand . Bitcoin supply is limited to 21M so when the demand rise. The value also rise. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:42:05
Cool, you have a fast computer :)

Virtex is pretty secure. If you don't hold anything in there and just make quick transaction there is very little risks. I know that fees sucks though but it is my best option so far. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:19:44
Bitcoin isn't debt based like fiat so the market don't owed its bitcoin to the elite.

Even if bitcoin security has been compromised (which I highly doubt), QuarkCoin should be the last choice of everybody. Can you show me the link?
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:07:54
Cool so spend all your bitcoin, never save a single one and stop whining. Problem solved.

You can buy and sell bitcoin with the ATM. The fees are probably higher than using cavirtex. I never tried since I don't live in Vancouver.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:37:59
It's not about bitcoin, it's about this 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:04:14
How a mining period of 6 months can provide a better distribution. It’s completely the opposite! Bill Still is either a f*cking liar of a complete idiot! We should do a 51% attack on this scam…
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:45:07
Once you will start moving some bitcoins, you will find that moving fiat is a real pain in the ass because of the archaic banking system. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:52:14
Quark is the worst altcoin around. Obvious pump and dump scheme. You have been warned. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:08:39
They are doing more money selling those machines at poeple mining at a loss than mining for themselves
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:55:41
Conceptually, there is enough of a single bitcoin for everybody on earth.

Gambling should remain a game. Not a way to earn money. Try to keep that in mind...
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:42:10
No. It increase the market cap and make everyone else's bitcoins worth more until you spend them. Saving is good, spending is good, trading is good. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:36:54
In any cases, I'll stick with my bitcoins!

Welcome in the club. Here why I hate banks 
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:55:13
The only way is doing a double spend. I don't know how to do that though

You can't mine bitcoin using GPU anymore. You need specialized hardware (ASIC)

If you bought with money you can afford to lose, why worry?
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:54:07
Agree but there is just no ask wall ATM...
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:38:05
I agree with all you said but the thing you seem to not understand why banks fear bitcoins and the whole concept behind it is because they are literally losing the power of creating money out of debt which is their core business model. They can't control cryptocurrencies. It's all about losing their control over money. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:23:26
My advice is a 50/50% bet. Buy 50% now and 50% when it’s gonna crash. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose and buy bitcoin for the long run. Not for a quick few bucks or you’re gonna get burn.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:20:47

Yeah and the ability to create money out of nothing with the deposits.

I'm from Montreal too. I can sell you some if you want. Just PM me
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:51:33
From now on, every existing altcoin are totally useless.

Cash and bitcoin are very different and that's why bitcoin has been created. Litecoin is just a copy of bitcoin.

Too bad it's just for the US

No litecoins distribution is spread on many years. Quarkcoin has the worst distribution scheme of all alcoins together. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:42:00
Microsoft is a bunch of assholes. This will obviously fail. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:38:46
Exactly. A huge amount of people are now getting into bitcoin no matter if it fluctuates wildly in value, no matter if bussinesses around it fail or succeed, no matter if it is legal or not but because of the idea behind it. That's why bitcoin is here to stay no matter what.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:51:40
They still think the government can shut it down. Hillarious.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:21:57
I agree with OP but you can't stop speculator to speculate... 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:49:37
Much more irrelevant than anonymous central banks stakeholders that own 75% of all fiat in existence and can print all the fiat they want. What about that?
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:02:24
Thanks for pointing exactly where I'm wrong! lol

@_date: 2013-12-19 04:27:12
Nothing has intrinsic value. Value is very subjective. For something to have value it needs only 2 things: utility + scarcity. Utility can be remove by competition and scarcity by an abundant source of supply. Same is true for gold. Gold has lost its value as a medium of exchange, that's why we use fiat. Gold still have some physical properties i.e. as a good electrical conductor but if you find a cheaper and better material, it will lose its value as a conductor. Gold is still a good store of value but if we find a mine with tremendous amount of gold or if a meteorite full of gold fall from the sky, we can say goodbye to the value of gold as a store of value.

@_date: 2013-11-28 17:25:38
My guess is that there were a lot of miners in Canada in the early days and  the supply of bitcoin in comparison to the demand is above the rest of the world.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:01:14
bitcoin is hyper monetizing 
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:49:08
bitcoin is not fiat. Here what is fiat 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:35:03
If the prices of bitcoin stand only on speculation, then a crash would be a good thing because all people (me) waiting for cheap bitcoin will be able to buy in again. Otherwise, if bitcoin prices are going to get monetized by 2014 then we can forget about the crash :(

you can use  for small and easy purchase. At least it allows you to make a try with bitcoin. Otherwise use

@_date: 2013-11-25 12:27:13
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against altcoins innovations. I'm just saying that no actual altcoins are real innovation and that is why they have no chances to take off. They are pointless to the market and cheaper prices is irrelevant since they can be divided unlimitedly. I'm still waiting for a real inovative altcoin but right now, there is none. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:45:07
Awesome! Are they listed on coinmap.org?
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:02:09
Yes when they will open the bitcoin store on the first floor. It's planned for mid-december if everything goes well.
