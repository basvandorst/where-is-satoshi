All Internet security in 2018. But what about post-quantum cryptography?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:36:15
I bought one from them back in December, it’s pretty good. Unfortunately Ledger is sold out at the moment, so OP would have to either pre-order or buy from a third-party (and hopefully avoid the social engineering scams that resellers of Ledgers are pulling right now.

If your bitcoin is on Coinbase, you don’t own bitcoin, you own an IOU signed by Coinbase.
Withdraw it to a wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:57:54
Imagine the fees to put those bits in those wallets. How much for 1000 output transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:05:08
You’re *not* holding them, Coinbase is. You should probably hold them. To find out the difference, ask someone who had MtGox hold their coin.

You write down the recovery words on paper. They mostly all use the same BIP seed word standard. All the brands/apps that use that standard for their hardware or software wallet aren’t going to vanish.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:04:26
Yeh, probably waiting until March or whenever they are back in stock os a good bet.
Though if you can avoid social engineering, there shouldn’t be any way a reseller can physically tamper with the device without the software picking up the tampering.
But, yeh, I bought from Ledger themselves just to be sure.
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:37:33
Look in to free Coinbase withdrawl via GDAX. I haven’t used it but it’s apparently the way to go.
With Binance I think you will have to pay a mining fee to withdraw.

I’m using CEX.IO, I’m pretty sure their fees to deposit from a bank account was higher, that’s why I chose to use my credit card.
4% isn’t much compared to the 30% I lose in commission and BTC withdrawal fees.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:54:48
It works like an auction (kinda), you choose the fee you pay, offer a lot less than other people’s fees and your transaction wont go through.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:07:40
It’s **pseudonymous** meaning you generate one (or two or a million, whatever) identity in the form of an address, everyone can see what that address does (what address it receives from and sends to) but nobody knows who controls that address or how many other address (and which) the same person controls.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:28:53
With a hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor, theoretically it should be impossible to hack. So that’s your best bet there. Just use the correct set up procedure and verify your seed words and keep them safe. Avoid social engineering tricks by resellers.
With an app on you PC/phone then there is a risk of hacking. I believe several have already suffered various levels of severity of hacks.
I don’t know really how to advise avoiding scammers. Scammers are pretty smart and adaptable, sadly. :(
Edit: just to emphasis, if buying a hardware wallet, buy directly from the manufacture if possibly, be aware of social engineering tricks pulled by resellers. Also, validate that you have written the newly generated seed correctly.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:50:19
Still pretty expensive to get in. Minimum order on the exchange I used (CEX.IO) is 0.01 BTC, which is about £120 now. When I bought, it was about £100 but with them taking a fee on deposit, then another fee on conversion, then a third fee on withdrawal (I know Coinbase allows free withdrawal, but they won't verify me), it cost me £150 to get £100 worth of BTC. I understand if people don't have £150 and just want to throw in like £10 or something.

@_date: 2018-01-31 21:26:02
You mean increase the block size by creating a hard fork?
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:14:59
When I withdrew, they paid about 0.01 BTC in fees (less actually, I'm rounding) for the transaction to about 20 recipients, which is about 0.0005 BTC per recipient, and they charged each recipient 0.001 BTC so they made an extra 0.0005 BTC per user out of thin air by paying less in fees than they collected. Each output address adds bytes but not that many bytes.
I'm sure at other times, they end up sending to 100 or more recipients depending how busy they are, and still charge each user 0.001 BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:00:55
To generate a paper wallet you:
1. visit a website, 2. wiggle the mouse around until it says you’re done, 3. hit print
**HOWEVER... that’s not secure** if the website is malicious and/or compromised, or your computer is compromised
You should visit a trusted generator, download the code and validate that it’s not hacked, isolate your computer and run it offline, preferable from a Linux live CD and print it preferably from a non-network printer.
All those extra steps are just to ensure your security. But the basic act of making a paper wallet itself is easy.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:25:18
I heard they set it to 5 sat.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:42:40


If they're British then your **maths** is obviously off.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:20:53
Also remember if your computer has malware (probably less likely on Linux than say Windows, but not impossible), it could theoretically watch you generate the paper wallet, note down the key and send it to an attacker when you next log on, or even give you a fake key. That’s why people say to do this from a Linux Live CD.
Personally I feel like the hardware wallet is the more secure route.

By the time the block reward hits 0 Satoshi, it will have for a long time been significantly less than the total mining fee per block.
So it won’t matter when it switches over from near-zero to actual-zero. All the miners still around then will have already stopped caring about the block reward already and only be mining for pure fee.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:32:00
I wouldn’t be surprised if one day Apple build a hardware wallet into a later revision of the Apple watch, with a user-friendly Apple Pay UI on the phone. Probably not for a long time though. Maybe 5-10 years

Create a new account and see if there is an option for recovery from the seed. I’m not familiar with the particular wallet but there probably is an option when you sign up.

Not having a printer is an issue since you would be writing down a long string of letters and numbers. One mistake writing it down and you’ll essentially end up never being able to recover the coin you put in there. Goodbye coin.

Yes you can withhold the block from the pool.
But all you would gain from that is screwing over the pool, meaning the pool would have less coin to give out to it’s participants (of which you are one).
No you cannot submit the block as if it were your own. The pool hides necessary information about the block content for you to do that.

True, I don't expect blacklisting to create a hard-fork that anyone would actually opt in to follow.
But, I can imagine a situation where mining pools agree not to themselves mine a transaction from a blacklisted address (but they will mine on top of a block containing one).
Then it's not a hard fork, it just means having to find a pool which doesn't follow the blacklist, which depending how widespread the threat/coercion goes, might be difficult, or maybe there's just one such pool and it has 0.1% of the hash-power so your transaction takes forever to go through. You can get your transaction in to the main chain but at a snail's pace for the 1st confirmation.

If you'd said "1 cent fee to send 1 cent", it would be equally true and less impressive sounding. So $10,000 is not relevant information.
You always beat a percentage-based fee by just writing a big enough number. If BTC fees were $1000 you could just say "only $1000 fee to send $1,000,000,000. Cheaper than banks now!" and it would sound impressive.
What you should be saying it 1 cent fee for any amount.

CEX.IO, the only exchange which verified my ID, has a *minimum* purchase of 0.01 BTC ($109.00, or $119.98 after commission) and a mining fee of 0.001 BTC ($10.91) to withdraw any amount. So I could spend $119.98 to get 0.009 BTC ($98.10). Actually, I'd be more than $119.98, since CEX.IO takes a 3.5% commission on fiat deposits, and my bank also charges a couple of extra bucks for purchases on cryptocurrency exchanges, so say about $125 to get $98.10 of BTC a month. Certainly, that will get me started, but BTC is going to have to moon pretty hard before I get my investment back.

I just looked up the details of repayment.
Interest is 0.9% per year. If your salary is under £22,000 you're not required to be making any repayments, above that they are deducted rom your paycheck. Anything not paid back after 35 years or when you reach age 65 or die is automatically written on, or if you become permanently disabled and unfit for work it's written off.
I can't find any information on whether or not they an be written off in bankruptcy, but I imagine not having to pay payments if your salery is not high enough makes that mostly a non-issue.

Where did I even mention being *"very"* experienced in something was necessary? What does that have to do with anything? I studied the TCP/IP stack in my university degree but I'm not "very" experience with it.
The average Internet user at least knows how to operate Internet Explorer. The average person off the street does *not* know how to operate a bitcoin wallet or what the hell the difference is between an address is vs a private key, and why can I not just send my private key to the seller instead of waiting an hour for this "blockchain" thingy to do a thingy.

I am aware than Coinbase sells BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC. I don't think selling BCH is promoting BCH over BTC. If they were calling BTC "Bitcoin Core" and listing BCH at the top with ads saying "BTC is dead, BCH is the new BTC" or something, then I'd say they're promoting BCH. Just saying they have BCH isn't promoting it. Most exchanges have BCH.

The minimum you can pay (other than 0 of course) is 1 sat total. So if you paid 1 sat, the take 1 and divide it by the number of bytes in your transaction and that fraction &lt;1 is your sat/B.

Because the blocks are full, you need to compete in the fee market against the other transactions trying to get in to the next block. You are in a bidding war with other transactors. What would the miner pick a transaction with 0 fee if another had 1 satoshi? That’s where the bidding starts. Look at Dogecoin, blocks aren’t full, so you can pay 0 shibetoshi and get mined still.

Moving Bitcoin out of Coinbase to your wallet requires a transaction on the blockchain, this requires paying a fee. Coinbase will chose the amount of fee to set. And they will probably set it too high.

They may or may not decide to support some fork, since it’s their BTC, they decide.
I’ve never used Bread Wallet, I don’t know what key derivation they use, but if it’s like other wallets, you can get at the private keys if you know the seed.
In general, if your BTC is in a wallet, you and you alone control what happens with it, it’s your coin. On an exchange, the exchange controls what happens with it, including locking you out if they decide they don’t like you, or vanishing completely if they MtGox and go out of business. Nobody can do that to you if it’s in a wallet you alone control.

If there are quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin's PK cryptography, then 1 BTC = $0.00 since they could take all the owned BTC too, so who cares? The same quantum computer owners who pick up the lost BTC would also pick up my BTC, your BTC, and Satoshi's BTC too.
It would have to be forked to a quantum-resistant blockchain **before** then and nobody would care what happens to the original BTC and nobody would mine on that chain anymore.

I don’t know the laws in all (or even many) of the countries they operate in, but if one deliberately ran off with all the crypto I imagine they might face some kind of defrauding charges in some countries they operate in under some law, like taking people’s fiat and not providing a promised service. Probably someone with a law background in the relevant jurisdiction might be better to answer that.
But they can definitely withhold coin sent to wrong addresses, or refuse to support future forked coins they hold etc.

2. Bursery - up to £1,875 of free money depending on household income (means tested) - don't have to pay it back

If the price drops, fewer miners will be interested in playing, meaning the difficulty goes down, meaning the profitability goes back up. In theory is should self-sustain at just-barely-profitable.

Seriously, if I had kids, I'd be teaching them about crypto using Dogecoin.
Adorable mascot, quicker transactions, nearly empty blocks mined, nearly empty mempool, optional fees, and cheap enough you can own hundreds of coins for a dollar.
It's the same technology as BTC, but less of a barrier to entry to learn about.

Grandpa? What’s Bitcoin?
Well little Shib, it was the original blockchain cryptocurrency before Dogecoin became the worldwide most accepted standard currency. I think I have a couple of 1000 BTC laying around from my old mining days, but they’d only be worth about 0.00001 DOGE now. Such disappoint. Wow.

Exactly this, if the smaller pool mines, say 1% of the blocks as a large pool in given time period X, but the smaller pool would pay out 100x as much per unit of hash power (per block mined) to it’s members, so it exactly balances out.

For a while now, people have been using student loans to invest. The "news" part is it's Bitcoin now. I know some people who just dumped it all into a high-interest savings account that locked away for a few years.
I don't know how student loans work elsewhere but here in the UK you don't even have to start paying them back until you earn above a certain income threshold. And they're not really considered "real" debt in a financial sense. It gets erased after age 60 or 35 years after graduation or if you die or are declared unfit to work /disability or something. It's the most generous loan you'll ever get. Definitely take advantage while you can.
Personally, I didn't actually take out a student loan, but I really wish I had and put it all on BTC. :(

If you don’t control the private keys, then you don’t have cryptocurrency, you just have a balance on an exchange.
You can’t claim the forks, unless the exchange decides to give forked cash to it’s customers, because the BTC is not under your control.

The first BTC I got was about $8 and I put it in a paper wallet and then moved it to and wallet in Electrum and set the fees really low and it didn't move, so I replaced by fees twice until I was spending like $6 in fees and it moved. Probably could have done that smarter in hindsight.

What is this “invalid address” of which you speak? Are you talking about intentional burning? People can do that with their coin if they want.
Please read up on how bitcoin are actually sent.
People lose bitcoin mainly because they lose or forget their private key.
There’s no way to know if bitcoin sent to an address has a person in existence who knows the private key.
Also it doesn’t matter if bitcoins disappear from the system forever. All that does it make the remaining ones more valuable.

Correct, thus you could not distinguish between coins that don't belong to anyone and coins that belong to people who never got around to manually upgrading. So both types would have to be left behind.


I never suggested an automatic process. I'm imagining a manually upgrade. Any coins that didn't get manually upgraded (whether owned or not) would just be ignored and not be usable in the new chain.
The point is we wouldn't have to worry about "distributing" them among users who upgraded, or explicitly "burning" them. Just any coins that didn't get manually upgraded are by default not considered spendable on the new chain. This would be functionally the same as if burning them but you don't have to pay any attention to them specifically. Just whitelist all the coins that *do* exist on the new chain (the ones that manually upgraded).

Yes you see which UTXOs were used if they used one the other.
But also it could be that B has a 10 BTC UTXO and another 10 BTC UTXO and sends a transaction using **both** as inputs and outputting 10 BTC and taking 10 BTC back in change in which case the concept of which was sent would be meaningless because the two UTXOs were merged together in that version of the transaction.

sodogetip is a Dogecoin bot not a Bitcoin bot and you're posting in the sub.

Coinbase is used by more than Americans. There are users around the world, and global businesses processing Bitcoin payments through Coinbase. And if the most popular exchange went down, it's would pretty much destroy a huge portion of the public interest and confidence in cryptocurrency as a concept.

I think the best way is to use Bits (1/1000000 BTC = 1 Bit = 100 Satoshi). It's already an established term supported by many wallets, and it has the property of being divisible into 100 units, just like the dollar. Adding kSat to mean 1000 just adds another unit when we have a unit for 100 Sat.

Bitcoin is not a Pyramid Scheme. Google Pyramid Scheme or read the Wikipedia article on it.
Bitcoin is a decentralise system that nobody owns. The risk involved in investing in Bitcoin is that it may (I stress *may*) end up being a tech “bubble” akin to the 2000’s web bubble (google that too).
But we hope it is not a bubble and become a more stable investment in the future.
But it by no means a pyramid scheme.

If I say *"Send BCH to this address and I promise I'll look after it for you and give it back if you ask."* and you send BTC to that address, or BTG or whatever other BTC fork uses the same address format, and I don't put in extra work and effort to go retrieve the coin for you, I haven't broken my promise to look after BCH you sent to that address.
Another way to think about it. Let's say you send 0.1 BCH to the BCH address (correctly sending BCH to the BCH address) and I promise I'll give it back when you ask. I'm allowed to go lend that BCH out to someone else, get it back, shapeshift it to Dogecoin, and spend the Dogecoin on hookers. And then when you ask for the BCH back, in order to keep my promises, I'll go buy 0.1 BCH from some guy on Craigslist and then send it to you and I've kept my promises since it wasn't your coin while I had it and it's not your address so all I need to do is give back the same quantity of BCH you sent to the address when you ask for it. But if you didn't send BCH to the BCH address, then I wouldn't owe you any crypto. But if you think of the BCH address on the exchange as "your address" then you're making a mistake.
