What about btc-e?

There really isn't a 'best' software. Just find a program that works for you and use it!
A Google search will get you a long way.

As someone who lost over $6000 in bitcoin, I feel your pain....

Not anymore....

IF you have 10 bitcoins, TAKE IT TO AN EXPERT.
That's my best advice.

So bid: buy price
And ask: selling price?
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:17:35
I still feel worse

YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL.

From the pic it doesn't look too badly damaged.
Just Google 'computer repair shops' and call them up. Ask them if they can fix a USB stick.
Explain that you have *important* files on it. Just **DON'T** tell them you have bitcoins on it. The flash drive might just 'break'.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:49:16
Just be careful....

50BTC is the mining pool. I have 6 bitcoins in my account. I sent myself 0.07 bitcoins to test whether or not I would get them.

Well, when miners stop mining, the difficulty will lower. Eventually an equilibrium will be reached of difficulty v.s. profit.

It a **text** post. I'm not whoring karma....
