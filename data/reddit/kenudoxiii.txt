When you take your morning shit and check your blockfolio to see it had dropped 50% over night... then you shrug your shoulders and wipe your ass thinking that was one hell of a shit.

Came across that app as well.   I got a notification from my device (iOS) that said it was an I trusted app.   So I just deleted it and use the site on safari.

There’s no light in litecoin.   But there is in lightning network.

I love bitcoin...  but I’d rather not pay $16 in fees for $5 dollar meal.

What exactly is the definition of a scam coin in crypto?   
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:39:42
I think crypto just attracts a specific personality type.   You either hate it or you love it.

Well if it’s temporary, once power returns, any working machine running a node would be able to re create the network.

Regulation scares off scammers and whale groups looking to coordinate pump and dumps cause their accounts may get audited for the huge volume trades.    
Regulation is good for the market overall, it’s a signal that the world is acknowledging crypto.  It’s the first step towards mass adoption.

Isn’t Lloyd Banks a rapper?

No.  It’s two different cryptocurrencies.   And theoretically, if they could, both coins would have to fork at the same time resulting in bitcoin cash, bitcoin core, and bitcoin reunion.    I’m guessing the amount of BtC+Bch you own would be equivalent to your forked BCR amount.

If you invested more than you could afford to lose, than you deserve to shit in your pants.   
To the rest who can shrug your shoulders to this blood bath, here’s a beer for you.   
All I can say is Cryptocurrency has gained so much momentum, it’s here to stay.

Well if you kill yourself now, you’ll be wishing you’d still be alive when bitcoin hits 20k in the spring with s total crypto market cap of 1 trill.   Just sayin...

No, it applies to everything and everyone involved with cryptocurrency.    As I understand, rumors state that tether was used to pump up bitcoins price, without any real dollars backing it up, this is evident by the massive trade volumes coming out of bitfinex.    If this is true, the current reflected price of bitcoin that you see right now may be $10,000 dollars, but without the accused tether pumps, it may only be $7,000.   Since almost all of cryptocurrency is tied to bitcoin, everything is devalued by %30.

That’s exactly what it means.   But technically, you cannot physically hold a cryptocurrency... therefore you must hodl it.

True... but a lot less progress had been accomplished with cryptocurrency and blockchain in general compared to today.
