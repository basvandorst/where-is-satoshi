Obvious shill. Transaction times and cost on the way down, and will heavily decease if the crash continues. There will always be faster alts, and guess what those are in the shitter, too.

Right, it's the same thing that happens in a REGULATED market where officials can do manipulation or insider trading and they are exempt from the laws for citizens regarding it.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:24:59
They are right about it being nothing, and they are using Fiat which is even worse than nothing (it is inflation and debt).
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:13:08
That's patently false.

Bought in first time at $17k, and have dollar cost averaged more buys all the way to my average value now being $12k.
Happy as can be, ready to hold and buy dips for a very long time. The tech is amazing, and the wealth gain potential in the meantime is a bonus.

Then you're not ethical. Ethics aren't a matter of practicing it only when it's convenient are harmful to others.

The confusion is coming from BCH. They have a vested interest in causing the confusion, which will harm BTC and everyday harm all crypto (including BCH). They win rather way, by displacing BTC or by collapsing all crypto, because the market movers and promoters of BCH have proven they are in it to cash in and out while taking as much as they can from others.
When the major movers of an idea or movement have to start changing names of the idea, it pretending their idea is something else, and then use paid shills in media and take over Twitter and sub-Reddits that are named something they wish to destroy, them you know the idea or movement is completely selling to just profit any way they can off the caused misfortune of others that they create.
Now, I'm speaking of the major movers in BCH, not the individual supporters who actually value that movement or idea. If you support BCH honestly, and feel it's superior, you need to silence and ruin those major movers who are discrediting your movement by using those tactics.

Complete lies or extremely dropping of context. However, let's pretended it's true... Who cares? Who the fuck cares? Stop being envious, petulant little shits and move YOUR life. Your life and success isn't harmed by the wealthy, and in fact had secondary consequences for a century that has spread and grown the quality of life. Get out and do something with your life, instead of post or spread bullshit based in envy or skewed "equality" crap.

Really, because government officials constantly do this in a REGULATED market as well, manipulation or inside trading, and it's perfectly legal for them, too.

I got in a week before you, got verified on Coinbase/gdax, poloniex, Gemini, binance, kraken and one or two others, but it took all of 3 weeks before they were all done. Thankfully coinbase verified quickly and Gemini not much further after.
I can't imagine how hard it was a week after I started, I think the user requests quadrupled after my first week. Stick with it, post in their subreddits and social media accounts and you may get bumped up.
Oh, and wire transfer in the money, ACH or debit/credit is God awful and takes forever.

Just explain to them in terms of how fiat actually operates, and when they laugh at that tell them you didn't describe cryptocurrency but actually what they use and accept right now. Then it's they are interested tell them how crypto is better.

If you don't have money to the side to take advantage of dips and opportunities in all parts of life, you may be over extended. You may want to take some gains from time to time and stick it back in wait, or consider if you have too much tied up somewhere in your life.

Is this how little the brain is used today? People want so badly to find the "gotcha" idiotic point-out that they don't even look to see that it's a graph that's been scrolled back to July, and the January 16th 2018 at the top is CLEARLY just the date when he pulled up the graph?

Because government prevents it mostly, and you guys there a fit because now government was taken away when net neutrality was removed.
Instead of complaining about net neutrality going away, demand the FCC be dissolved and that government gets removed from any power with granting coercive Monopoly to ISPs, even locally.

Noob here. Last couple of weeks I bought at 15.7k and 17.2k. Saw it drop to 13.5k and spent 25% of my remaining funds I allocated for drops. Woke up the next morning and saw 10.8k, jumped out of bed like it was early Christmas and bought more. It was exciting to use FUD as a motivator to actually buy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:42:00
Pull 15-20% when that happens, wait for 30%+ dip later and buy some back.

People should not be congratulating him...
He's lucky, but it was still a horrible idea to use all the money he had to buy a single investment. That type of situation is why people panic sell. That practice harms the investment.
If this is how he handles his finances, it doesn't matter how much money he lucks into, he's going to crash and destroy his life eventually.
Invest smart, user proper ratios on your risks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:16:10
Except the BCH collusion will fail, and the market will have caused it to fail and punish this act...
Yet, if this happened in the actual stock market, it wouldn't have been prevented, and it's highly likely those involved would either point of a single scapegoat to take the fall, or get a slap in the wrist, it with enough money or political connections they'd completely get away with it.
Regulation is evil.

The answer to capitalism? There's no answer needed. We've never had capitalism on this earth. And if we did it would be the most moral and proper system we could achieve.
You're mistaking our current government and elitist cronyism/collusion as capitalism. Sorry, but that's more related to socialism.

LOL, this is my study. I know how it works. I know how risk factors into personal finance. Even finance 101 classes discuss it.
I know it's bad to live a millionaire lifestyle with risk. I live one without the risk. I see those around me who choose to use the risk to get there, and then the nearly inevitable collapse that happens to them, either from their own personal doing, whether it be their fault or not, or global economical events out of their control.

I won't affect anything by taking away rules that, if you actually read them, have nothing to do with equality if data but rather government censorship and growth of powers.

Which is no excuse to allow regulation, but rather get rid of the system that allows thugs to take control at the threat of fully banning things.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:55:37
It can luck out in the short term as a move that was beneficial. It is not a smart move. Investing and personal finance is more than a math equation, and even in finance education there's the inclusion of risk (which you've completely ignored) as an equation that obliterates your claim.

It cause artificial harm and fluctuations even worse than wild speculation. Regulations are not good and do not prevent collapses, it just monopolizes them for the few in the know or with government inside knowledge for them to take advantage of and move a market.
Crypto was made to combat this paradigm, stop promoting the very thing crypto was supposed to resolve by your brainwashed government-regulation-is-benevolent claptrap.

It is a bubble, just like it was a dozen times before, just like other things in economy have been bubbles before, and yet they all persist and grow later. Being a bubble, at a specific point in time where you point at it and declare "bubble" does not mean it's perpetually unsustainable or bad.

Morally and logically bankrupt petition, it calls for removing OVERregulation. Government has no right role in regulating it at all, to call for just a little bit by bureacrats is to say they have a rightful role and that central planners can be god-like enough to make the right decisions for billions of people.

So between FBAR and having to report values of coins at the exact moment they are mined or bought or moved or traded it means tax reporting is essentially impossible for crypto.
