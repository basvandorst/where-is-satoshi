Lol Bitcoin is paypal's competition why would they do that? If Paypal's service is more efficient and can handle more than 3 transactions at a time bitcoin is only good when buying coccaine or something illegal.

Bitcoin is still a stored 'value' right if there is really value there. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:39:35
Did dogecoin came into the picture? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:20:44
Satoshi's vision all along

Dogecoin is better lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:14:05
This community condemns people who notices the flaws in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a hobby not for mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:37:14
Well said this Community is a meme. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:10:59
True that's why people here bash people who critisize bitcoin. All they want is to cash out
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:15:15

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:52:46
True these guys gang up if you question the flaws in bitcoin. They're so defensive they don't like the cristism. Can't take bitcoin seriously as long as I see it alongside Dogecoin for God's sake. BITCOIN IS A MEME Coin
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:42:28

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:53:24
Bitcoin takes 30 minutes or more for it to confirm transactions that's not really convenient. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:29:40

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:23:12

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:56:53
Bitcoin is doomed to fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:39:10
Your friend willing to wait 30 minutes per transaction or nah? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:43:18
Where does the bitcoin fee go?  When transferring
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:52:14
I can send someone money in 10 seconds through Paypal though. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:32:06
I bought some bitcoin. First thing I really noticed is how slow it is and incovenient. 
@_date: 2019-12-16 12:04:12
Paypal send to friends or family is free though
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:52:09

@_date: 2019-12-18 14:28:18
too many steps, until you can do this in just 1 step your grandma or uncle won't understand it, the average joe can't understand it easily. we have to wait until it becomes a standard not an option a really hard option.
@_date: 2019-12-18 10:44:45
You mean like designer products? like LV Gucci etc?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:06:34
Have you guys ever go shopping and wait 30 minutes for you pagment to go through it's awful for business
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:40:05
It can't. people use it only  for 'investment'
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:25:15
It's inconvenient slow and out of date. 
@_date: 2019-12-18 11:17:46
how so? can you swipe it in 2 seconds and be done with it? I'm just wondering large scale adoption wise, why hasn't it took off yet? I was ready to buy some bitcoin but more questions seems to be hindering me. I saw that it takes 20 minutes or more for confirmation that isn't gonna be convenient enough like Alipay. Also how can it be adopted if everyone is HODL.
@_date: 2019-12-05 05:57:02
* Time to sell everything
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:53:57
