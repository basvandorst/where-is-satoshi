For some, there are always nits to pick. It’s much better then waiting for six months and as technology improves it will only get better.

It’s not going up as quick as before, but this thread from a few years ago makes sense to me. If you believe it will keep going up, after 10 cycles you end up with 80% still invested but have consistently taken out a good amount. I waited until 4x before starting a 10% rake.

I just wanted to point out there are some who have made solar powered camper vans. Here is a VW conversion that gets ~50 miles PER DAY on solar. [Solar Camper Van](

Tesla Roadster 2.0
The days of fossil cars are almost up.  Even Ferrari said they are making an electric to try and beat the Roadster to market.

I believe people got use to electronic payment with PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, etc. The idea that there is an alternative to plastic cards and paper cash is not too extreme anymore. Bitcoin is the most recognizable name and had the largest user base.

If you are buying on Coinbase, you are getting today’s price even though it takes two weeks for the bank transfer. You can also setup the account on GDAX and wire the money from your bank account.

How is this different than Grayscale’s GBTC trust which you can trade with a normal brokerage like Fidelity?

I have GBTC in an IRA for crypto exposure. How is it different?

I used my gains from last ATH to buy a new electric car.  We have actually had electric cars since 2013.  Don’t even know how much gas is where we live.

Let it grow to 4x and then take out the original money. Or let it grow to a larger percentage of your net worth.  Every time it doubles after that, take out a percentage, 10-20%. This will allow you to get your money out and still have enough to take advantage of growth without FOMO. Decide on the plan in advance and stick to it.
