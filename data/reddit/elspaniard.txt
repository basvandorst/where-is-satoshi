I remember when it hit 1200. Boy there were some drunk ass folks that night. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:28:37
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this the 5 minute or the full half hour?
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:42:50
Yeah. I've been watching BTC steadily and slowly decline the last several months. Seems like ~360 is some sort of ceiling it refuses to go beyond. It just jumps 10, falls 12, jumps 15, falls 18. Not very confident at this point. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:32:04
Any idea why their price keeps slowly, but steadily, sliding the last week?
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:13:35
I'll let them sell then. I bought a handful of btc back in 2012 at $65. So I have just a few hundred bucks invested at this point. Just kind of watching this little experiment. If it works out, great. Maybe I'll have some extra money to give my son for his college tuition. If not, no matter. Only cost me that few hundred to watch something really interesting for a while. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:18:25
Yeah, I see that. But I was wondering *why*?
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:40:20
Under Buy/Sell on CB, there's a Recurring Payments option in the left sidebar. You can set it to auto draft on price or btc. I buy 0.1 every week with it. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:36:34
Elaborate, please.

Every single one of you cats saying Newsweek can't be sued over this, and shouldn't be, would be singing a different tune had this happened to *you*. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:13:57
Alright, thanks for the explanation. 
So, if the Wall Street boys get into the game (legitimately), then the crazy times we've seen the last year have basically only just begun, because here comes the real money.

That, and Stewart's appearance on Crossfire right before it was shit canned. That man just knows how to twist a knife. I love it.

I personally started with a five year plan. Bought 5 btc back in 2012 at $65 and planned to reevaluate in five years. I'm not selling or using. Just wanted to experiment and see where it goes. It was real hard for me to just sit on them when that $1200 run hit last year. But I did. I'm interested to see what Wall Street is going to do.

And you'll have your nice vacation in a federal pound me in the ass prison shortly thereafter, as well.

I've told you once.

Defamation, perhaps?

iOS devices have never been about hardware. Ease of use, accessibility, and the fact that phrase they "just work" is what sells them. The average consumer doesn't want to navigate the 2400 different versions of android os, that apps don't consistently work properly with, and the experience is consistently a mess. And the average developer doesn't want to deal with the minefield that is the google play store because of the rampant piracy there that makes it next to impossible to turn a profit on that platform. Rovio literally gave Angry Birds away on the play store because the theft is so bad there they saw no point in even trying. And don't even get me started on the joke that is the Microsoft App Store. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:03:06
I'm not panicking. I haven't sold a single point since I started buying in 2012. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:47:44
I'm not arguing anything. I'm simply stating that had *any* of you here just been accused of being a person who may be hiding the keys to a half billion dollars in your non-fortress home, and having your name, address, car, photo, and license plate published for the entire world to see, you *might* not be so, "Oh, well. I might be murdered or harassed the rest of my life for something I don't even have, but hey. What they did was legal and I'm ok with that."

"not hearing from customers" = we have our own currency plans and aren't listening to our customers anyways. 
This pretty much puts them right up there with Apple, IMO.

I wasn't able to get Showtime this year. Without any spoilers, was this last season of Homeland any good? I've seen the first two seasons, and will eventually get 3 on blu ray when it comes out, if it's worth it. Your opinion?
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:04:54
No problem

I've had my wife under a gag for years. She won't shut up about it 😏

A journalist should investigate the journalist then.

Guess I will be getting the bray then. Thanks man :)

No, but I'm getting really sick of every time one single individual in the community acts like a certified turd, my portfolio takes a 15% nose dive.  One person from one shitty exchange should not be able to throw the entire system into disarray like this. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:02:14
I weathered the plummet of last year. I'll weather this nonsense. Everyone is hating on me because I get a little frustrated. I just want some kind of protection that one individual can't ruin what could be a good thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:27:08
Across all exchanges too. I'm really sick of this shit. One asshole from one shitty exchange shouldn't be able to fuck everybody in the blink of an eye like this.

People who got in in just the last year or two have become frustrated and/or disenchanted with no upward movement. The problem is though, they're not leaving en masse, which would cause the price the sharply tick down, giving investors the opportunity to buy in cheap bulk, which would dwindle supply and drive the price back upwards. They're leaving (pun intended -&gt; ) in very small bits at a time. Which, in turn, very slowly increase supply of Bitcoin, which very slowly melts the price a little here, a little there. Never going up. Just very slowly downward. In short, Bitcoin is eating itself, one tiny bit at a time. 
So what's the end game? Well, one of two things is definitely going to happen:
1) Bitcoin is here to stay, and is in for the long haul as adoption slowly builds. Price will (eventually) slowly creep upwards. 
2) Bitcoin continues wasting away and dies. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:00:44
Thanks man. I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:19:48
Awesome, thanks!. One other question. If I take the bitcoins from my Coinbase account to an offline wallet, does that mean I can no longer sell them back to the Coinbase exchange, or can they be loaded back into my Coinbase account at any time?
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:20:41
Bitcoin isn't special in terms of price. It relies on the same supply and demand principle all other commodities do. The less bitcoins there are available, the higher their price.

Recently consolidating 2 of the top 3 most sold products by all carriers in the U.S. Is "downhill"?
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:52:50
Oh wow! Thanks for the aurum!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:35:44
I bought mine at 65. 
Unless you're a millionaire, you're not going to make money off bitcoins in the short term. You don't have the money to buy and sell for small gains on large quantities. Think long term. Bitcoins are being accepted at more establishments and sites every day. Chinese investors are snapping them up left and right, draining supply, which will drive up their price. And the US Congress just gave it a piece of legitimacy. 
Wait. Bitcoins aren't going anywhere anytime soon. As as demand grows, supply shrinks. Prices will go back up. I have a 5 year plan. In 4 more years, I'm going to take a look again and see where they are.

The reason is simple. The Android OS ecosystem is a mess. There's a huge number of variations on the OS, spread out all over the place. Apps written for one version work like ass, if at all, on another version, creating an extremely inconsistent experience full of bugs, crashes, and developer loss. Angry Birds just gave their android version away because they knew there was no point in charging for it, as the android app market is rife with theft. Granted, Apple's has it's own piracy issues, but it's nowhere near as extensive as what developers have to deal with on Google's store.
Source: I'm an app designer &amp; developer. 
Furthermore, though Apple's products are much more closed down (you can still jailbreak and do whatever you want), the "just works" and accessibility aspects of Apple products is the reason they sell so well. 2 year olds can pick up an iPad and be a pro in an hour. That was the genius of Apple in their iOS products. They were easy to use and they just worked. 
Android based devices, though commendable for trying to be partially open  (don't kid yourself, they're not open source) just have far too many variables that leave the common user with a bad taste in their mouth when apps constantly crash and you're always having to deal with updates that make even more apps crash. 
Source: I have a couple buddies who were *hardcore* Android users. And I mean they had tattoos of Android logos. Bought an iPhone and threw their Galaxy s3's in the trash a month later and haven't touched an android device since. Another buddy of mine fought with me for two years, said he would never touch an iOS device unless he was dead and they forced one into his hands. He now owns both iPhones and iPads and says he'll never touch another android again. I asked him why, he said, "these things just don't crash."
