Really? Bitcoiners remind *me* of the people who told me the Segway is going to transform the world... or the Nintendo Virtual Boy... or New Coke!

Couldn't agree more. It takes quite the imagination to assert that bitcoin will ever even come close to replacing the Federal Reserve. That's some Falkor from *The Neverending Story* level shit. Congratulations on your vast imagination.

Gold has been used as a store of value for more than two millennia; the world's most powerful nations store a significant portion of their national reserves in gold, which represent *trillions* of dollars worth of GDP and productive capacity.
None of these things apply to bitcoin, not even a little. Bitcoin solves a problem that doesn't exist. The most credible justification of bitcoin's utility (that it can be used for international remittances while avoiding expensive fees) falls apart when you consider that a large portion of remittances are sent to people in poor countries with little to no internet access.
The rise in value of bitcoin is a classic case of speculative mania. People only have a cult-like devotion to it because they honestly believe they're going to be made into bitcoin millionaires.

The bot isn't saying this is a repost, it's saying they linked directly to your submission.

So in order for me to win the bet, I would literally have to wait until the end of the universe to prove that bitcoin never reached $100k USD. If bitcoin fell to $0.01 tomorrow, and stayed at $0.01 for the next thousand years, that still wouldn't prove that bitcoin will never reach $100k.
By the way, I'm pretty sure you yourself must be a troll, because this is fucking hilarious. I especially like, "the digital instrument that would inevitably free humanity from financial tyranny." Nice touch.

No, it's everyone else that is crazy; I'm the sane one. They obviously don't like bitcoin because they lack the mental faculties to understand it, and not because bitcoin is fucking stupid. Is TulipCoins also your Yahoo! handle? You freedom hating statist shill.
@_date: 2014-07-21 01:29:49
So you're predicting that bitcoin will be worth $2.5 billion each in three years? Yeah, okay.

It isn't possible to prove a negative. You could come up to me with a handful of "magical" beans given to you by an invisible elf and tell me they will be worth $5 trillion someday, and there's no way for me to prove you wrong.
But we can have reasonable expectations on the value of things. If the only reason you believe your magical beans will be worth $5 trillion someday is "because I think so," then your expectations on the value of your beans are *without* reason and nothing more than wishful thinking.

My point is that *they aren't wishing for a better world*. They are guilty of falling for the same sort of selfish investment mania that OP is talking about, and they just use the "save the world" line as a bullshit justification for their own greed. That was my point.

Dear god, no! If you turned this into a drinking game, we'd all be dead within the hour.

To be fair, he wasn't the one making the comparison, he was just responding to it.
@_date: 2014-05-03 02:50:57
So instead of the value of your BTC fluctuating, the value of your newBTC would remain constant but the *amount you have* would fluctuate (i.e. if the value of bitcoin drops 50% then your 1000 newBTC are now only 500 newBTC)? I don't see the point. Isn't that even worse? Six of one, half dozen of the other.

The value of M-Pesa is essentially pegged to the currency of the market in which it is being used... it is nothing like bitcoin. If I buy 10,000 Kenyan shillings worth of M-Pesa, and then a month later send it to a friend, it's still going to be 10,000 shillings. On the other hand, if I buy $100 worth of bitcoins, and then a month later send it to a friend, who the fuck knows what it'll be worth.

If you're willing to go as low as 100k, [this guy]( has an offer you can't refuse!

Bitcoiners love to claim that it has nothing to do with greed and that it's not just some get-rich-quick scheme, but then people post shit like this. "OMG BUY YOUR CHEAP COINS WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!~1! WE'RE GUNNA SEE 12,000% RETURN ANY DAY NOW!!!!! TO DAAAA MOOOOOOOON!!!!"
Has it ever occurred to you that, perhaps, assholes who make comments like that are just looking for rubes like you to buy their coins? Seriously, at what point do members of this community finally wake up to the massive pump-and-dump that is bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:18:32
Feel free to teach me all about economics, Mr. Professor. Please, what in the world makes you actually believe bitcoin will __*EVER*__ become *even close* to "10 percent as popular as gold?" I'm dying to see your evidence, seeing as how you're such an expert in economics.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:58:06
At least you're upfront about your reasons for being in bitcoin. Most bitcoiners seem to spew some bullshit about lifting Africa out of poverty or magically ending all evil and corruption in the world.

But that would be accurate... Newegg doesn't accept Euros, Visa does.
edit: people can downvote me all they want, it doesn't change the indisputable fact that Newegg doesn't take Euros.

Right, but if bitcoin goes to zero and the entire network shuts down, their prize is bitcoins that are now worth $0. So if they win they get nothing and you don't have to do shit, but if they lose they have to do something disgusting and degrade themselves and you become a bitcoin millionaire. This is literally the stupidest bet I've ever seen someone try to make, which is why I'm convinced you must be a troll.
