"OK" might be a little strong, I'm sure we'd all prefer it not to be this way right now.  Some severe growing pains, but like they say, pressure makes diamonds.  When Bitcoin comes out the other side of this problem period, it'll be that much stronger.

I thought consensus around these parts was that the txn fees were a result of spam, and inefficient use of blockchain space by some large actors that refused to use segwit and batch?
Surely lower fees in that context is a good thing?

It's optional, but it's supposed to make economic sense to use it. It's supposed to align incentives naturally, rather than forcing people to upgrade in a given time frame.
Yes, everybody is being priced out, however as a segwit user, I pay less for transactions than non-segwit users. The lazy are being priced out more than I am. Sooner or later those who refuse to use the network efficiently will be entirely priced out, or out competed by businesses that are more efficient.

Nobody competent that is accepting bitcoin would ever wait "only" 15 minutes.
But fine, batch in 1 minute intervals.  If Coinbase is really using as much of the block space as they appear to be, even batching every minute would help the network.

@_date: 2018-01-03 11:46:10
The problem here is that fees are non linear once blocks become full. If enough people are willing to spend to jump to the front of the queue, the median fees will be much higher.
Then others see the median (and maximum) fees being high and respond by increasing their own fees.
I'm not sure where you got your volume figures from. They don't seem right to me. Btrash has roughly one eighth of the transactions per block that bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:18:43


I think you have hit the nail on the head here. But here's the follow up question :
Should we upgrade/compromise the network to make allowances for lazy network participants who refuse to make use of the newest/most efficient technology available?
I'd say "no". The lazy need to be replaced by the nimble and efficient and motivated. The lazy should be priced out. It is not the responsibility of the rest of the network to subsidise the lazy.

You are misunderstanding. I talk about "hosted" lightning channel.


The exchange, today, manages the private keys on behalf of the users. What I'm wondering is if it would be possible or feasible to store each client's funds in a lightning channel, instead of a sql database.
I do see a risk here, that the customer funds would be "online" instead of in cold storage. However the funds would be locked in a lightning channel - the only way to get the funds out would be via the lightning network. Which would add traceability, no?

Yeah, that's correct. But with segwit your transaction weight is less, so it's cheaper.

Depending how much you have, coinbase might be "safe enough" until your ledger arrives.
Paper wallet is a good idea for storage, but you need to be aware of the security implications - you should consider things like safe booting to an off-line o/s, for example.

The only way you can reduce fees is to use segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:02:18
Sure it is, but it provides a sense of scale.
If two guys can half arse it in a weekend, a "real" company with a "real" dev /qa team should be able to push it to production in a few months.

My guess would be that the spam engine is set to "normal". However with the holidays, network usage is even lower than normal, so it is not running at sufficient speed to overwhelm the network.
Keeping up this level of spam has to be expensive, even if you are in bed with a miner. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:58
Why do we need more scaling solutions?
Because even if the only on chain transactions anyone ever makes is to put their monthly pay cheque into a single  lightning channel, that would only support on the order of 10 million people.

Segwit has only been live for months. It's only very recently that the pro segwit camp (ie. Users of bitcoin) have started to make noise. Sooner or later services that use segwit will out compete those that do not, simply due to the reduced fees on segwit transactions. The positive feedback effect of that will force other services and wallets to upgrade, or be left to die.
The same dynamic will come in to play for lightning, and other second layer solutions. I'm of the opinion that the effect will be much more pronounced here, given the order of magnitude reductions in transaction fees, and multiple order of magnitude increase in transaction speed, all with no loss of security.
 But it will still take time for the software to be developed, mature, and roll out. Heck, the reference bitcoin client (bitcoin core) still does not support segwit in the gui!

Yes, ok. But for a "hosted" channel it would work just fine because the exchange has the keys anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:53:12


Not well.


You can see the world the way it is and ask "why", or you can see the world the way it could be and ask "why not?".  
I've been emailing my exchanges and wallet providers regularly asking "when segwit".  I've already changed my mobile wallet to one that supports segwit.  I moved my hardware wallet contents to segwit addresses.  As soon as an exchange that is domiciled in my country comes along with segwit support, I'll be taking all my business there.  What are *you* doing to try and move things forward?
Nobody is denying that we need more scaling solutions.  But scaling solutions won't solve anything if the businesses and users in the space refuse to use them.  Unless you decide to hard fork to try to force people to use your preferred scaling solution...  
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:00:52
So, we're of an accord then. This is something that could happen, and would spread the usage of lightning. Great news! 
Although given that getting exchanges to support segwit appears to be like pulling teeth, I'm not sure we'll get there any time soon...

If miners stop mining, difficulty drops, making the miners that remain more profitable.

@_date: 2014-06-12 06:05:55
TIL.  :D
A brainwallet when you choose some words that you use to "seed" a private key generator (if I understand correctly, you effectively hash the words into a private key).
This is different to the password that you use to encrypt a private key (eg BIP038) for a paper wallet, for example.  
This is also different to the "seed" used when you set up a new private key in (say) electrum.  The reason electrum works is that it chooses the words for you and effectively guarantees enough randomness to make it secure.  I guess in theory if you chose to memorise the electrum seed words you would have an effective brain wallet - the difference being something else chose the words for you and you had to try to remember them (hard to do) vs you choosing the words that mean something to you so you can remember them (much easier), but that also makes them easier to guess.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:11:46
Ouch indeed.
But they don't even need to be cash stricken for that to happen.  If they go public and the board decides that the bcash holdings are dead weight, they'll get want to rid of them.  And you can forget about mining bcash, and you can also forget about mining bitcoin to prop up the bcash price too.  That's worth a couple more ouchies.
And then what happens?  Bcash price drops, bitmain stops mining bcash, both price and hash rate plummet - maybe &lt;1% of the hash rate of bitcoin?  Now you've got a true shitcoin that can be 51%-attacked by a malicious bitcoin mining pool, potentially without that pool's members even noticing.  So now exchanges, merchants stop accepting 1-conf or 2-conf (forget zero), start having to wait 10 or 20 blocks?  Now that's an ouch.

I disagree with your assertion that it wasn't theft to perform this attack on mtgox.
Call it "obtaining financial advantage by deception" or whatever you want, but if you make a withdrawal, intercept the tx and change its hash and rebroadcast it so that the network accepts the modified tx, then go to gox and re-withdraw (taking advantage of their automated re-send as well as their buggy implementation), then you are stealing, plain and simple IMO.
And the thing is, the people that did this, MtGox should be able to figure out who they are.  All the double-withdrawals are in the blockchain, and presumably the accounts were verified.

No I mean you as a client can use a random input into the key generation function to generate a brand new address that is still owned by the private key. So effectively everyone generates their own address that is likely unique, because of that random input.

To obtain a massive user base requires a significant monetary value to be constantly transmitted via bitcoin. Given the fixed and relatively small amount of bitcoin in existence, a high value of bitcoin is necessary to achieve this goal. The only other way would be with a very high velocity, however that is difficult to achieve especially given the relatively small number of ways to spend bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is still bootstrapping. Increased value adds legitimacy and encourages adoption. The potential for increased value is one way to reward early adopters for risking their time, money and effort. 
So, while I may agree that increases in the price in and of itself doesn't add legitimacy, increasing price is a necessary part of the transition to mainstream adoption.

To me, the tax avoidance possible with bitcoin will force governments to move away from inefficient and distorting forms of taxation (income, corporate profits, capital gains etc.) and into more efficient taxes (consumption, land).

Amateur here too.  :D
Interest in a fixed-quantity currency environment isn't a problem.  Interest is a function of the flow of money, not the total amount of money.
Yes, loans and more specifically fractional reserve lending inflate the money supply.  But with a fixed monetary base (M1 maybe?), the inflation of the debt-backed money (M2 maybe?) is not only constrained for a given fractional backing, it's also something that is out there in the bright light of day for everyone to see, not hidden in some back room of the federal reserve and Goldman Sachs.  To me, that sounds much better.
Given that Bitcoin is drastically deflationary right now, you'd have to be a fool or a crook to go for a bitcoin denominated loan.  But in however many years time when the Bitcoin value has stabilised, the deflation will probably be roughly equivalent to world GDP growth.  I can't say what that will be, but given how much world GDP growth right now is being propelled by printing money, there is a good chance that it'll be relatively negligible (low single digit percentages).
And as for the spread, some may argue that 0% is the minimum a bank could offer depositors, but I'm not sure that's true.  How much would you pay for a guarantee that your money is safe, secure, and insured?  OK, you're probably a geek like me and have no problem setting up a USB-boot to linux on a laptop to create paper wallets, but what about your parents or grandparents?  If Bitcoin is deflating at 1%, then even if the bank charges 1% on deposits then they are still ahead of today when the bank pays 0% and they get inflated away at 2% (if you believe official figures).
Wherever it ends up, one thing is for certain - we live in interesting times.

That is somewhat what I am saying.  Laser printer toner is deposited via heating.  Laminators use heat.  It is possible (if improbable) that the heat of the laminator could re-melt the toner and transfer at least partially to the covering paper, degrading the image.
Hence my query about you testing your ability to recover your private key from a laminated wallet. 
If you've tested it and it's all cool then good job - maybe your laminator isn't hot enough to re-melt the toner, maybe your paper is thick enough to insulate the toner from the laminator's heat.

I guess if you wanted to try to sugar coat it, you could say that it was identified and fixed fast (once that's done of course), that nobody lost any money, and point to how quickly the community responded to fix the problem as proof of strength and resilience of Bitcoin.

Good question.
If you literally did it at the same time, then half the nodes in the network would see the ramen transaction, and half would see the dice transaction.
So crudely speaking you have a 50/50 shot that the ramen vendor would see the ramen transaction, and a 50/50 shot that the dice vendor would see the dice transaction, giving you a crude 25% chance of pulling this off.
If you are smarter and have the resources, you can try to connect your dodgy clients to the network such that the ramen vendor is more likely to see the ramen transaction first and the dice vendor more likely to see the dice transaction first, however at this point you've already spent more than the cost of a bowl of noodles to pull this off.
**However**, a dice site would be foolhardy at best to accept unconfirmed transactions for bets (or at least foolhardy to pay out winnings from unconfirmed bets), for one.  (I have a recollection that this zero-conf attack has been used against dice sites in the past, causing them to change the way they operate, but in a more sophisticated way - by doing a true double-spend attack, see at the end for more).
For two, smarter clients than our BitcoinQT or Android bitcoin client can watch the entire network and alert on double-spends (which would only take in the order of seconds - similar to the standard propagation delay when paying/accepting zero conf. transactions).
For three, any delay between sending the two transaction will drastically favour the propagation of the first transaction over the second.
There's probably a "for four", but that's all I have right now.
** double spend dice attack
1. You solve a block that includes a big transaction to yourself.
2. You do ***not*** broadcast the block
3. You broadcast an identical transaction to the dice site
4. You lose the bet
5. You release your pre-mined block, effectively re-spending the bet back to yourself
If no block is solved between  and  you have successfully rewritten history and saved your lost bet.  Obviously if your dice bet wins, you just discard your pre-mined block and collect the winnings.
This also shows the cost-benefit calculation of double-spending - the block reward is 25, so you'd need your expected profit of pulling off this attack to be greater than that to make it worthwhile - otherwise it just makes more economic sense for you to mine legitimately.
This sort of attack is more specialised than a general double-spend attack (like for a bowl of noodles) because you can choose to make the dice bet once you've solved a block.  For noodles, you can't practically stand at the door of the shop waiting for your farm to solve a block before you go in and order your noodles (that you then have to wait to be cooked).  Every second you wait between solving a block and doing the double-spend increases the chance that someone else will solve a block and put your spent coins in the vendor's hands.  And this is why double-spends for zero-conf transactions in a bricks-and-mortar setting are unlikely to occur.

For one, you're conflating 51% with a massive overwhelming of hash power.  Someone with 51% cannot rewrite the last 1000 blocks (that's a week's worth of blocks).  Or at least, it would take them so long to catch up to the other 49% that it's not a realistic attack.

I think Bitcoin has value beyond niche.  The infrastructure may not exist today to support all I've described, but two years ago there was next to no infrastructure at all.  Now we have Bitcoin ATMs, we have multiple merchant payment gateways, and more coming online every week.
From where we were two years ago to now, now imagine another two years of accelerating improvement, and then another two years after that.

I think you are confusing "money as debt" with plain old "debt".
The difference, in a nutshell, as I understand it:
For plain old debt: I have a bitcoin, and I loan it to you.  Now you have a bitcoin, and I am owed a bitcoin by you.  End of story.  There is still only 1 bitcoin in the system.  
For money as debt:  I have a dollar, and I loan it to you.  Now you have a dollar, and I am owed a dollar by you.  If I am a bank, I can take that dollar that you owe me to the central bank, and they will create $0.90 and loan it to me.  There is now $1.90 in the system.
The Bitcoin debt can be sold to someone else, or collateralised, but the other side of that transaction needs to already have the Bitcoin.  With "money as debt" a central bank can create the cash out of thin air.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:00:39
No it's not.
If I sell you $10 worth of gold for $10, how is that a transfer of wealth?  And how is that any different with Bitcoin?
And what if you sell me $10 of your labour for $10 worth of Bitcoin?  How is that any different to using currency?
Even if I happened to get that $10 of gold for $1, or even found it in some dirt, it's not a transfer of wealth.
Now, if the dollar dies, and Bitcoin thrives, then those left holding dollars will lose wealth yes.  But if the dollar dies because of Bitcoin then the dollar was going to die anyway.  The lifetime of Fiat currencies is relatively small on the historical scale.
At the end of the day, the use of Bitcoin, unlike Fiat currencies, is entirely voluntary.  People will only use it because they are better off doing so.  Which means that, should Bitcoin become defacto global currency, then by definition people are better off under it than otherwise.  
I would really like for you to elaborate your concerns, assuming I haven't addressed them.

Assuming you're in the USA, you'd experience the same if you bought, say, Yen at 100 to the dollar, and then found a coffee shop that would agree to take Yen at, say, 90 to the dollar.  You'd be taxed (sales tax) on the coffee purchase, plus you'd trigger a capital gain/trading profit of 10% on your Yen "investment".
Not that I'm saying that any of this is sensible, just logical.  I'm of the opinion that should Bitcoin take off, really take off, governments the world over will be forced to migrate their tax bases away from taxes on capital (and to a lesser extent income), and more towards taxes on consumption.  Which I think would be a good thing for everyone.

"If the Treasury were forced to convert the $1.4 trillion in short-term bills (on which it now pays an average interest rate of 0.056 percent) into 30-year bonds at the average rate it is now paying on such bonds (4.919 percent) the interest on that $1.4 trillion in debt would increase 88-fold."
Seeing it put like that blew my mind just a little. I mean, I knew that the US is basically insolvent, but it's hard to fathom just how far in the crapper they are. The numbers involved are hard for an average person to grasp. And if you do manage to grasp it, the problem seems so insurmountable that the idea of fixing it seems impossible. Probably what those in charge count on to continue this disaster...

@_date: 2014-08-14 22:12:02


Inclined to agree, which is why I'd personally lean towards pairing it with a very flat, very simple income tax. Say, no income tax below the poverty line, 1% up to 2x poverty, 1% more from 2x to 3x, all the way up to 10% for 10x poverty.  It's still quite flat, it's simple, it's regressive, and it doesn't give anyone a huge incentive to avoid.
As for the hit to GDP when you tax consumption, you've probably nailed why AFAIK most countries rely on taxes other than consumption.  I personally think a little less consumption and a little more saving may be a good thing, but that's a bit out of fashion right now.
In Australia our GST excludes fresh food.  But it complicates the system, so I'm in two minds about it.  I probably lean in favour of the complexity with the added benefit of encouraging healthier eating.
I'm glad you mentioned sales tax vs consumption tax.  Our GST operates differently to the way described in your link.  
I wonder if the method used by NC would be simpler to implement.  It would shift the compliance burden from businesses to consumers.

In theory and in practice yes.
If you "deposit" 100 bitcoins to my bank, and I lend out 50 to someone else, with everyone knowing full well that my bank operates at a 50% reserve ratio, then it's all good.  And I would be lending out "real" bitcoins, in the true sense of the word.  Yes, you no longer own real bitcoins, you own a promise to bitcoins - but once you put me in control of your bitcoins then they weren't your bitcoins any more anyway.  They became a promise to bitcoins the moment I gained control.
With a single "at-call" depositor I'd be playing a risky game.  With tens if not hundreds of thousands of depositors, the actuaries would tell me that my risk is significantly reduced.
On top of that, the blockchain allows me to prove to all my depositors that I actually hold 50% of their bitcoins (if not more) in storage, reducing the chance of a run on the bank.
And on top of on top of that, I would have not-at-call deposits as well as my own lending facilities available to meet any short term fluctuations.
And on top of on top of on top of that, I would encourage people to keep as much as possible in not-at-call deposits, and possibly institute withdrawal limits, depending on the type of the account.
Please point out the flaws in my reasoning, because it seems we disagree.

Despite how it sounds, they don't truly consider bitcoin to be a safe haven, or anything else. The media has a need to ascribe reasons for things happening. They see an effect and must proscribe a cause. 
Some times they get cause and effect right. Some times they get it back to front. Often times, imo this time, they grab the most obvious thing that can be vaguely plausibly spun into a cause and run with it. If you watch long enough you'll find the same cause being given for opposite effects some time apart (eg.  Market turmoil causes bitcoin to drop today, in a month it will be the exact same 'reason' for a rise in Bitcoin).

Not only that, but **everyone** who holds bitcoins the day before *they* (for whoever *they* is) decide to increase the total supply will experience the inflation/dilution/reduced value.

I'm not even sure that's what he's saying.  I'm reading it as more like as a client you pay (in bitcoin) to the servers (nodes) that send you content.
Just typing this as I think it, but imagining a live bitcoin-based market where you push out a request for content and a price you're willing to pay, and nodes bid to supply the content.  Or alternatively nodes advertise a price and bandwidth, and your client chooses based on your preferences.
Might be a little bit too much micro-transactions for Bitcoin, seriously who's going to pay more than a coule of cents for a youtube clip?  But I think the basic idea is sound.  The technology for doing distributed market/payments is certainly around now.

You still need a bank account on the other end of both the in and out transactions.

If you lose your wallet after making (sending) 100 transactions, you may lose some funds, if you don't back up.

You assume way too much. Anonymity isn't illegal. Bitcoin isn't illegal. Selling legal goods for bitcoin over the internet is not illegal. 
Having your bitcoins mixed with bitcoins used for illegal purchases by the business you use to intermediate legal sales makes your bitcoins illegal as much as having cash deposited with HSBC makes your deposit illegal. At least in my non lawyer and not financially interested opinion. 
Last time I checked legality /illegality of something was determined by a court, not by decree of law enforcement. 
I remain of the opinion that if someone used silk road for purely legal sales, and can prove it, and if they had enough funds stored on the site to make it worthwhile pursuing, then I think they have a good reason to pursue this and(I hope) a decent chance of success.

You *can* do it.  Few do because it's not worth it.
The point is, it's not worth it.  If it takes a six month round-trip between you-&gt;USD-&gt;bitstamp-&gt;BTC-&gt;gox-&gt;USD-&gt;you
then is the hassle and risk and opportunity cost of tying up a few thousand dollars for maybe 10% really worth it?  (and don't forget the risk)
And that's just one trade.  To make any *real* money you need to keep doing it, but given how long the pipeline is you'll need huge amounts of capital just to get a meagre flow of trades.

Money-as-debt is not the same as fractional reserve lending. Money-as-debt is not possible under Bitcoin. Fractional reserve lending ***is*** possible under Bitcoin. Fractional reserve lending is possibly more honest under Bitcoin.
That term "fractional reserve" is a correct one, but it doesn't get to the heart of what I think you are saying (and I agree) is wrong with fiat money-as-debt money.
Fractional reserve banking is possible under Bitcoin.  And given the extreme transparency that is possible under Bitcoin, it would be an honest form of fractional reserve banking.  If you deposit bitcoins with someone and they promise not to loan out more than 50% of deposits, and you can audit this daily via the blockchain, then it's just another voluntary transaction.  And I personally have no problem with the idea of honest and transparent fractional reserve banking - it's the current implementation that causes problems.
Money-as-debt is another whole layer on top of fractional reserve banking, and one we agree is dishonest.  Money-as-debt can't be reproduced under Bitcoin (or anything other money system where the money is a physically limited good - eg gold).  
Although if people start using "promise to pay Bitcoin" as money (similar to the way US Dollars used to be a "promise to pay gold") then we could come right back to where we are in a money-as-debt type system.
To me, the difference between gold and Bitcoin here is crucial - I can totally understand why someone would rather use a "promise for gold" instead of actual gold for their transactions.  However I can see few circumstances where a "promise for bitcoin" would be considered just as good as actual bitcoin.  The abstract nature of bitcoin means that abstractions away from bitcoin are less likely to be more useful than raw bitcoin, meaning the market (people) should tend to prefer the real thing rather than a "promise".  Add to that the ease of redeeming a "promise for bitcoin" and the ability for people to conjur "promise for bitcoin"s out of nothing is severely curtailed.

Didn't bother adding it up. Also didn't bother questioning the 150 million figure. 
The point is, people complain about how "expensive" the Bitcoin network is without comparing it to the current systems. 
And for comparison you can't just compare to the transaction networks. You have to include everything else. The bank branches and head offices. The vaults and the printing presses. Worldwide. 
And trillions per year isn't crazy. The global equity markets turn over trillions in a quarter. Add to that bonds, and derivatives, and a trillion per year isn't much.

I suggest you talk to an accountant about the tax treatment.  I expect you would still be liable for gst on the aud value of the sale. But I am not sure about the income tax aspect. 
Seems reasonable to me that if you paid tax on the aud value of the xbt at the time of sale then you would have a nicely recorded cost base for the cgt event that would be triggered when you dispose of the xbt later down the track.  But that's my opinion as a non-accountant.

Mining isn't about finding a public/private match.  Mining is putting a bunch of (valid) transactions into a block, and hashing that block.  Each block includes a hash of the previous block, creating a chain (the blockchain).
When you send 0.1XBT to an address, you are effectively using your private key to sign a message to the network that says "take the balance held at address X, send 0.1 to address Y and the rest to address Z" (where X is the address you hold that has a sufficient balance, Y is where you want to send the coins, and Z is the change address - another address you control).
The receiving wallet knows its addresses, so when the message comes along that assigns 0.1 to one of its addresses, it now knows it has a balance +0.1 compared to before.
That address Y is controlled by the recipient, with the recipient's private key, so now only the recipient can sign a message spending those bitcoins somewhere else.  The recipient had to give you the address to send the coins to, of course, so they know that address Y is theirs.
That's a slightly simplified view, but I hope it's enough to answer your question.
@_date: 2014-01-03 04:29:51
I think you need to figure out what you mean by "take control of".  
Because if "someone" decided to "take control of" bitcoin by creating an overwhelming amount of hash power then they don't really have control of Bitcoin - there are practical attacks they could leverage, double spends, selective mining etc. that would (or could) damage Bitcoin, but Bitcoin would still be a thing.
But if they tried to "take control" by way of altering the protocol to suit their needs then they would fork the blockchain, and anyone who didn't like the new rules (eg. no more fixed limit) would stay on the original blockchain unaffected (except in the manner that the new blockchain is competing with the old for market share).

Toss up between Avalon batch three miner and Avalon chips, I think. Actually no. My biggest mistake was to stop buying after the $30 crash for about six months.

My hopefully  not too convoluted solution:
Bartender carries a small smart phone sized device that can generate qr codes. Each transaction gets a unique address, private key belonging to the server. 
Bartender has a connected device (I have been to bars where each Bartender carries an IR scanner and scans barcodes next to the till to tally the purchase and open the till) that lets them create a bill for the transaction. 
When tallying /transaction is done device generates QR code.  Customer scans to pay (adding tip?).  Device flashes green (say) to indicate to the Bartender that the transaction has been paid. 
Will be no slower than using cash, possibly faster given lack of change and return trip to till. Will almost certainly be faster than a credit card (and soooo much less prone to Cc fraud).  And the whole system gives great record keeping and audit - ability  to the owner/manager.

Sadly this description doesn't do it justice. 
Most coins on an exchange should be stored "cold". Not on a network connected device. Moving from cold to hot requires someone manually create the necessary transaction. 
So somehow they managed to transfer 750k bitcoin (over the course of years? Who knows?) from supposed cold storage to hot storage without any kind of oversight or accounting or auditing during that entire time. 
The incompetence required to allow this is truly staggering, to the point that I find it hard to believe it is incompetence and find it more plausible that it's deliberate fraud.

Okay, it's possible my understanding of the way master public keys work may be a little off. I need to do more research, even if only to better explain myself if not to correct my own misunderstanding. 
The use case as I understood it was that I give you my master public key, you generate your own address to send to (a new address for each transaction) , and because I control the private key that was used to generate the master public key then I can receive the funds. 
If I need to know ahead of time what seed you are going to use to generate the address you send to then that requires us to communicate further , which as I understand it defeats the purpose of the master public key (or at least one of its purposes). 
So given that you have the ability to generate multiple addresses to send funds to me without further information from me, I came to the conclusion that this would allow two people to use the same master public key to send me bitcoin. 
Time to do some more reading and research.

I can imagine that in such a circumstance, the insurance company would want a multi-key signature to secure the funds (say, two of three), with the insurance company holding one of the keys. That way the only way the funds can move is if both the lawyer and client agree to move them.
I don't know if this is a thing yet, but maybe instead of a 2/3 key setup, the insurance company would want a "one + one of two" key setup - ie. the insurance company holds the "one", which *must* be used to spend, and the client and lawyer hold one each of the "one of two" keys necessary to complete the spend, which means the funds can only move if the insurer and the client, or the insurer and the lawyer, decide to move them.
If I were to insure millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin against theft, I'd either want a guarantee that the only way they can be spent is with my permission, or a guarantee that if they are spent, then I can prove that the other parties to the transaction either authorised their spending, or were subject to such gross negligence that the chances of having to pay out the insurance contract were negligible.

However successfully executing a double spend requires a not insignificant investment of resources.

Only true in a very limited sense and not at all in the way you described using the words you used. 
Block confirmation time is the same for everyone. Nothing you can do short of spinning up several petahash of mining power will get you "faster" confirmations. 
What fees can affect is whether or not your transaction appears in the current block. There are a myriad of rules and heuristics that miners use to decide what transactions to include in a block. But all else being equal, a transaction with a fee will be chosen over one without. 
However once you make the fee "enough" for miners to include it, adding more fee is a waste of your money.

I held on to some litecoins "just in case" for about a year.  In that time they did nothing but track the price of Bitcoin, so I got jack of it and sold out.  They were at about $15 at that time.  Probably broke even on the deal.
Maybe a week later, two weeks tops, they were at $75.

It's a trade-off between size and speed and security.

I'm going to ignore the "taxes are essential" part, because that causes arguments and I think it's not the point of your question.
The general rule is, you get less of what you tax.  
You tax income, people won't work as hard - you have surely heard stories of people that refuse overtime because of the extra taxes/lost benefits.
You tax capital, there will be less capital formation - imagine a "wealth tax" on assets and how that would slow down potential entrepreneurs from starting new businesses.  
You tax capital gains, you get less fluid movement of capital - imagine someone who wants to sell a business but decides not to because of capital gains tax.
You tax spending, people spend less.  Simple that one.
You tax corporate profits, you get corporations spending huge amounts moving jobs and profits to low-tax locations and loading up on debt with the interest payments being tax deductible.  You end up with less corporate profits, in the locale attempting to tax them.
In addition, taxation (and especially complex taxation) leads to distortions.  Firstly in the form of avoidance activities.  You tax income at differential rates to capital gains or profits, people spend money trying to shift from one type to the other.  And also in the form of altering behaviour, as people modify their behaviour to avoid taxes.
In addition to this, I would suggest that one should consider basic fairness, in that people who can pay more should pay more (a progressive system).  A flat income tax of $5k per year is regressive, as the person earning $10k per year pays as much tax as the person earning $1M per year.
So, my thoughts are that a tax should be as fair as possible, and minimise distortions, and be as unavoidable as possible.  Some ideas - consumption tax, land tax, death tax.  Land tax and death tax are obvious - none are avoidable, and both can be made relatively progressive.  
Consumption tax may be contentious, but it's less distorting IMO than taxing income.  Some claim that consumption taxes are regressive, due to the fact that the poor spend a higher proportion of their income.  However remember that unspent income is savings, and savings is capital formation, and capital formation is what drives investment and productivity and jobs growth.  I'm sure a very simple income tax with low income offsets could help without being too distorting.
And I also think that taxes on corporate profits are pointless.  Corporations are owned by people, and the profits are owned by those same people.  Any taxes on profits a corporation pays are effectively passed on to the owners as reduced dividends, or passed on to consumers as increased prices.   Corporations are just middle-men, and taxation should be at the end points.
Anyway, I hope my rambling stimulated your neurons.

A trade happens when a buyer and seller meet by agreeing on a price and size.
Generally speaking, given a book of buy and sell orders, you either execute a trade by putting in a buy (sell) order that will match against existing sell (buy) orders, or putting a buy (sell) order in the market that won't execute immediately and waiting for a seller (buyer) to come and meet you.
When the buy/sell order match, a trade occurs, and this is, for that moment in time (until another trade happens) *the* market price on an exchange.  This is the price that you see - the price of the most recent trade.
This price obviously fluctuates a bit, not only because there is a spread between the best buy (highest price) and best sell (lowest price) orders in the book, but because when someone executes against the existing orders they remove volume from the order book and widen the spread.
I hope that makes sense.

This advice applies to any online service where you aren't in sole possession of your private keys.  Just because someone involved with a service may or may not have done something that you think was scammy in the past doesn't make the advice more important, because it should be of utmost importance for every single online service that you deal with Bitcoins in.
So, I'm saying that you are right, but maybe not for the reasons that you think you are right.  If you were right for the right reasons, you would be posting this exact same advice in every thread relating to all threads relating to all exchanges and any other private-key-held-in-trust web services.

Thing is, spending is hard to hide. For one, the stuff you spend your money on is often visible. 
For two, the other side of your transaction has all the information needed to dob you in, so you need their help to hide your spending.  But it shouldn't be too hard to imagine a system where the merchant has incentives to report purchases made.  Heck, most consumption taxes are collected by the merchant, which means you need the merchant to actively participate in tax avoidance for you. 
Thirdly, merchants exist in a chain of suppliers of varying depth. If a merchant is avoiding sales/consumption tax, he's probably still paying those taxes on his supplier side. And decent data mining of him and his suppliers tax info should easily show a hole that should not be there. So unless the entire supply chain is corrupted, you should eventually be found out. 
Fourth, most * people are honest. They recognise what they get for their taxes. And despite waste and arguments around the edges, would rather pay taxes and get those services than pay no taxes and live in an anarchist utopia (another argument off topic here as to which is better and for whom, and why).   So this means that tax avoiders have a good chance of being dobbed in by others. 
* in my opinion and experience 
TL;DR hiding from tax where spending is taxed is much harder than in systems where income and profits are taxed and methods to convert between the two and deduct from either are available.

One way to prove that Dorian is not Satoshi would be for Dorian to be under guard/surveillance/unconnected whilst the real Satoshi posts a message signed by one of the early blocks he mines.
This doesn't actually prove Dorian isn't Satoshi, but it does prove that someone other than Dorian also controls those private keys, which is almost good enough I think.

They would push up the price a tremendous amount.  But as for "monopolizing" Bitcoin, what could they do then?  Owning a large number of bitcoins doesn't mean you control Bitcoin (note the small b for the unit of account, and the big B for the system/network).
If someone wanted to "destroy" Bitcoin by buying all they could at whatever price (say, the purchased 10 million out of the outstanding 11 million coins), the remaining 1 million could still quite happily be used by everyone in the world.

It's possible, but unlikely.
Let's say you have to choice to spend $500 on mining hardware, or spend $500 today to buy 1 bitcoin.
If you buy 1 bitcoin, you have 1 bitcoin, easy peasy.
If you buy the hardware and mine, the chances that you'll end up with 1 bitcoin after ongoing costs (eg. electricity) are slim.
You may end up with more than $500 worth of Bitcoin in the end - say, if Bitcoin goes from $500 to $5k in the next 2 years, you could double or triple your money or even better.  However if you had just bought 1 bitcoin, you'd have $5k worth of bitcoin.

If you believe in bitcoin, then the best way to show it is to use it as a currency and medium of exchange to pay for real goods and services.
Today, a merchant takes Bitcoin but uses someone like Bitpay to convert to USD immediately.
Tomorrow, the merchant discovers that one of their suppliers also accepts Bitcoin, again via Bitpay, but to save transaction fees they convert only a % of each purchase and start paying Bitcoin-accepting suppliers in bitcoins.
And so on and so on, the more people use Bitcoin, the more people will be inclined to use Bitcoin.  And it will only happen if people start using Bitcoin to buy stuff - it's gotta start at the customer end of the food chain.

2. Hackers can't hack Bitcoin, they hack those that use Bitcoin.  No different to ATM-skimmers or credit card fraud.
3. Speculation will always happen in a free market, and it can be argued that it is useful to help price discovery
4. Differences between Bitcoin and what came before are arguably the reasons Bitcoin will work where others failed
5. May be bad for Bitcoin adoption, but that's a very first-world-centric view.  For someone without banks, this is not a problem.
6. Regulation of some kind is a fact-of-life when you have government.  Could be good or bad.
Lack of central bank has nothing to do with taxability.  The anonymous/decentralised nature makes it potentially harder to tax.  May lead to governments moving away from more regressive taxes (taxes on income) to more progressive taxes (taxes on spending).
Volatility is an issue, as the market matures it will reduce naturally.  First, by price/volume increasing.  Secondly, mature markets provide options/hedging/futures that allow  one to effectively buy price insurance.  Payment processors already provide this in a BTC-&gt;USD manner, doing the same in a BTC-&gt;BTC manner (ie. allow you to pay your bills in BTC without the risk that a big price movement between when you sell your goods and when you pay your bills will send you broke).
Security is improving constantly.  Multisignature wallets are a big step in the right direction.  Hierarchical keys are another.
Hope that helps.

I was under the impression that Gresham's Law only really applies when money has a non-monetary use.
Wikipedia itself says that it applies to "commodity money", ie. money made of something that has value in and of itself, beyond the monetary value.
So, you have two $0.25 coins.  One is made of silver, so has a melt value, for the sake of argument, of $10.  The other is made of nickel, and has a melt value of $0.10.
The good money is removed from circulation and/or destroyed as people "cash in" to get the commodity value.  The bad money remains.
This, in my understanding, is Gresham's Law.
And it doesn't apply to Bitcoin, for obvious reasons such as Bitcoin not being a commodity with value outside of the Bitcoin network.  
But thinking more about this, bitcoins only have value because of the Bitcoin network.  So it seems like the opposite to Gresham's Law applies.  With a non-commodity non-fiat currency, not only does good money drive out bad, but potentially better money drives out good money.  Because of the voluntary usage, and the network effects of Bitcoin, adoption drives adoption, and it makes sense that people will move to the money that provides the best overall feature set and experience (within the bounds of "worse is better").
So if a Bitcoin 2.0 ever comes along that offers a compelling enough feature set to overcome the network effects and inertia of Bitcoin, there is a good chance it will replace Bitcoin in short order.

The key difference here that you seem to be intentionally ignoring is that a lone 20 dollar note in the gutter is clearly lacking someone who can prove prior ownership.
The original owner of the private key that controls the bitcoins you found can with 100 percent certainty prove that they were the original owner by showing ownership of the transactions that put those bitcoins in that address.
To me that is a clear and important distinction that makes it fundamentally different from finding a bank note lying in the gutter.

Growing price indicates growing adoption, by your own words.  Money ("electronic cash") is very much a network-effect type of thing, so increased adoption increases utility and legitimacy.
Therefore growing price indicates increased legitimacy.

Dogecoin is immune to hate, because it's a joke and meta-joke in one. Hating dogecoin makes the hater look like a fool, and draws attention to dogecoin.  And for dogecoin as it is today, any attention is good attention. 
No matter what you do, dogecoin will either succeed or fail on its own merits (or lack thereof). It certainly has more chance of surviving than the majority of scamcoins out there. 
Best case scenario, it serves as a gateway to bitcoin and provides an easy, cheap and popular way for people to get acquainted with the ideas, usage and more importantly dangers of cryptocurrency without risk of losing one's shirt.

The movement of bitcoins is certainly traceable.  You can probably get around that somewhat by buying/selling for cash.
But seriously, money laundering is for big bucks.  You think you can buy tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins with cash, and then sell them again?
But also, this isn't really laundering money.  By my understanding, laundering money is taking dirty money and making it appear legitimate.  $100k of cash with no reasonable explanation of where you got it from isn't legitimate.  If you can't spend it, it's not much use to you.

This would be the absolute best thing that could happen to Bitcoin, in my opinion.
It will legitimise and normalise the idea of cryptocurrency in the minds of the masses.  On top of that, the commercial and banking infrastructure would need to be "ported" to crypto.  People will become familiar with cryptocurrency and its usage, pitfalls and benefits etc, in short order.
Once that happens, it will be trivial, nay guaranteed, that people will look at the other cryptocurrencies around.  And for an individual or business or bank to switch from a "fed" cryptocurrency to an "open" cryptocurrency would be likely trivial at this point.
On top of that, having a "fed" crypto sitting right next to Bitcoin (and other crypto currencies of course) in the open market will allow people to more clearly see the benefits and downsides of each.  I believe that a decentralised and market-driven crypto will out-perform and out-compete a closed currency, crypto or not, over a decent time frame.
In the end, the market will choose, and removing barriers will only make it easier for the market to choose from the available options on their intrinsic merits, rather than based on external forces.
Sadly, I doubt those at the fed are dumb enough to try it, because I have no doubt they know all of what I just said to be true.

Makes no difference.  The protocol specifies that the difficulty is recalculated every 2016 blocks, with the difficulty adjusted such that the average time to generate a block is 10 minutes, based on the amount of hashing power in the previous 2016 blocks.  (Although there is a ceiling and floor to the difficulty adjustment amount).
If you altered your software to mine blocks at a different rate, those blocks would be rejected by everyone else - you would be forking the blockchain, and nobody would be using your fork except for you.

I bought "big" (for me) at the $1000 mark, right near where you did at the all-time-high.  I tried to be smart and did dollar-cost-averaging, but the price stayed high just long enough for me to spend all my spare money.  
That little adventure took my average entry price from around the $40 range to around $150.
It takes every ounce of my willpower to stop myself from "what-if"ing, and to remember these things:
1. I'm in Bitcoin because I believe
2. If Bitcoin thrives, I'm better off than I would have been
3. If Bitcoin dies, the money I've lost is "spare" (as much as anyone can ever truly have "spare" money)
4. If Bitcoin dies, I will have lost less on Bitcoin than I've lost in the stockmarket 
5. I lost next to nothing in Gox, and got to learn that potentially painful lesson quite cheaply
I've also learned that my ability to counter-time the markets is about as strong as yours.   For the first time in probably a year, I've stopped buying a little bit of Bitcoin every week with spare cash - as right now I have no "spare" cash.  To me, this pretty much guarantees that the price will fall in the near future - because I won't be able to take advantage of it, and also because tighter finances increase the chance I may have to sell bitcoin for fiat (rather than just spend it when I find something worth buying for bitcoin).
On the plus side, my ability to force the market to move away from me is not as powerful as the market over the longer term, and in 12 months time those of us with Bitcoin will be reminiscing of the days when you could buy a whole bitcoin for hundreds of dollars, and those who were doubters or haters will either be believers, or hating so much harder because haters hate to be wrong.

Ready to be corrected here, but "not much" is the answer.
Unless you can log on to your hardware and redirect it to the pool of your choice, then it's not "your hardware" (much in the same way as it's not "your bitcoins" if you give the private key to someone else).
A cloud miner could quite possibly profit quite nicely on the back of ever-increasing hashrate using the method you described.
Extreme openness by the cloud mining operator could reduce the risk of fractional reserve mining, and I don't know enough about any of the cloud miners that are out there to know if any are open enough to "prove" that it's not fractional.

It's an interesting contrast here between Bitcoin and the TBTF Banks.  One the one hand, they stuff up, it's their problem to fix (and their customer's problem of course).  With a TBTF Bank, the taxpayers would be bailing that shit out in a heartbeat.
I'm just glad I pulled all but a couple of dollars of spare change out of MtGox mid last year when things started going wrong with their withdrawals.  Until that point they were my main exchange for purchases (not that I bought much, but something &gt; nothing).  
I hope that those who have their funds in limbo get them back, and I also hope they learned a valuable lesson about what it means to trust a third party with your money.

For one, the network effect is what gives Bitcoin (or any system like it) value.  Bitcoin has the bigger (and more secure) network.
Does it matter if Bitcoin trades at $600/USD?  For $100 you get 1/6 of a bitcoin.  For $100 you get 10 Litecoin.
Is there anything you can do with 10 Litecoin that you can't do with 1/6 of a Bitcoin?  No.
Is there anything you can do with 1/6 of a Bitcoin that you can't do with 10 Litecoin?  Yes, lots - for one, spend it at many, many places.  AFAIK any merchant that accepts Litecoin will also accept Bitcoin.

You can use CoinJar (coinjar.io).  Get verified.
I personally wouldn't buy $6k at once (coinjar won't even let you initially - deposit limits start low).
I would buy, say, $500 or $1k per week for the next 12 or 6 weeks.
If you'd rather not go online like that, localbitcoins would be the way to go, but again, I wouldn't be buying $6k in one hit on localbitcoins.  Don't know what sort of prices you'd get though.  And be careful of scams.

I think off-chain micropayments using their platforms could provide a revenue stream.
Micropayments to use (eg $0.001 per tweet) would be the easy one to start with.  But then you add stuff like tipping  (good) and pay-to-promote (some would argue less good) and you could drive significant usage.
Then you could get inventive, with something like "pay to receive/view advertising" (so, you receive $0.0001 for every advert that you receive/view, and $0.01 for every advert that you click on).
Then you could get annoying - pay to not receive advertising, for example.  Pay to block.  Pay to follow.
Same things could apply equally well to facebook.  
Arguably some of these things would improve the experience - a cost, no matter how small, could make people think a little more before they post, for example.  But some could destroy the experience/platform.

This is just the first step.
First a business accepts Bitcoin, converting to Fiat immediately.
Next, they notice a supplier of theirs also accepts Bitcoin, so they reduce the amount they convert immediately and pay Bitcoin-accepting suppliers in Bitcoin, reducing costs for everyone.
Then as more business accept Bitcoin, less and less will be converted immediately, until the point comes when businesses that don't provide an option to accept Bitcoin will be the rarity.
Eventually, people who don't accept Bitcoin will start to lose business.
Then, instead of asking "why accept Bitcoin", people will ask "why accept Fiat".
In theory, the Bitcoin infrastructure will be built up as the popularity increases.

Whoever has a copy of the private key can spend the coins.  Which means that whoever printed this wallet can spend the coins.
The only safe way to transfer a paper wallet like this is to immediately import the private key and spend the balance to an address that you, and you alone, control.

Please, read what I wrote.
To take a hypothetical fractional-reserve-lending deposit-taking institution where customers know what the reserve rate is, and it can be audited in near real time by any interested party.... and then to compare it to Empty Gox, well, the intellectual dishonesty is simply breathtaking, smiley face or not.
Yes, the inelasticity of supply in Bitcoin would put shackles upon any fractional reserve institution - as rightly it should.  Why is why I suggested a reserve ratio of 50%, instead of the sub-10% that banks operate at.
And a bank that operates at 50% reserve would effectively be able to guarantee that depositors could get out 50% in the event of a run on the bank - no need for the central reserve bank to print money to bail them out.  And further recovery would be possible as debts came due.
But ask yourself - what causes a run on the bank?  It's a loss of confidence, a panic caused by the idea that the bank doesn't have everyone's money, or has made some bad choices that will bankrupt the bank.
Now, with a Bitcoin bank, the panic behind that doesn't make sense.  Firstly, the bank will tell you every single time they talk to you that they operate at 50% reserve.  Secondly, they will send you a link to a blockchain audit site that will show you that the bank's current reserves are &gt;50%.  And even if there is a run on the bank or the bank dips below its reserve ratio then the bank can immediately freeze withdrawals of more than 50% of the balance of any given account, allowing for an orderly withdrawal and limiting the damage caused by the panic-induced and rushed liquidation of assets required to fulfill withdrawal requests.
The point is, ***Bitcoin does not inherently stop fractional reserve banking***, and I will keep saying this until people stop falsely claiming otherwise.
Now, I'm not saying that fractional-reserve Bitcoin banks are a great idea - although I am confident that some would be willing to take the risk if the rewards are right.  But that is a choice that each individual can make for themselves.  Don't like risk, choose a bank that has 95% reserve ratio, but doesn't pay interest and charges fees on all transactions.  Like a little risk, choose a bank that does 75%, and get all your off-chain transactions fee-free.  Like to live on the edge, choose a 25% reserve bank and get paid interest on your deposits.
And if you are part of the "F*&amp;k the banks" brigade then keep your bitcoins at home - but there are enough people in the world that are unwilling, uninterested or unable to be their own banks, people that want insurance, people that want someone else to take care of the security so that a lost wallet or a compromised home PC doesn't cause you to lose all your life savings, that I truly believe there is a place for Bitcoin banks.  And one way for Bitcoin banks to get paid is via fractional reserve lending, in a totally honest and open and transparent manner.

 Storage
Absolutely.  Besides plain old safe deposit boxes for your paper wallets, providing dedicated non-internet-connected single-use computers/dumb printers for people to print/redeem paper wallets for said storage, as well as to create transactions for later broadcasting.
 (and also 4).
Absolutely.  Most banks I know currently do forex, and there is no reason they couldn't do the same with Bitcoin.
# 3. POS 
Probably not the way you are thinking in terms of providing PoS solutions.  But I can't see a reason why a bank couldn't provide the same sorts of merchant services that you get from Bitpay/Coinbase.  Add to that a little bit of double-spend insurance and you may have a business model.
I see an opportunity for an institution to get behind a Bitcoin hardware wallet.  2-of-3 addresses provide the ability for the service provider to give effective 2FA for Bitcoin spends above a predetermined limit, where that limit doesn't necessarily have to be in $ (imagine setting it so that every day you can spend $10 at your favourite cafe, and $20 at Amazon, and $5 on Steam, without 2FA, up to a total daily limit of $100, except for at your local pub on Friday nights where hard limit is $50.... you get the idea). 
2-of-3 addresses also provide the ability for a bank to provide secure and insured deposits.  If you store 2 of the 3 keys at the bank, then if the funds are ever spent without your permission then the bank guarantees to cover your loss, for example.  This would work well for a not-at-call savings type account.  For an at-call transaction account, a linked hardware wallet with 2FA and strict transaction limits could seriously reduce the instance of fraudulent transactions in the event of a lost/compromised device (even to the point of providing insurance/reimbursement).

I agree that each individual needs to make those choices themselves. 
But that is not "regulation", that is the essence of the free market. 
And I agree that we as a community needs to demand better from those serving us. But that's the point - we each individually and collectively need to demand that anyone we do business with behaves in the manner we require, or we go elsewhere. 
Each individual has the authority to decide for themselves, and to delegate that responsibility to others is what leads to problems, and regulations handed down by "an authority". 
A call for "regulation" by "an authority" is wrong headed in the extreme. We've all (most?)  been attracted to Bitcoin due to its libertarian ideals of self responsibility. Instead of calling for "someone" to "do something" you should be just plain old doing something yourself. And once you've sorted yourself out you are free to help others in what ever way you and they see fit. 
By all means stand on a soap box and demand security and transparency, and encourage others to do the same. 
But don't use fuzzy language, don't call it regulation, because it isn't.  And you'll annoy people who know better and confuse those that don't.

Very few people disagree that the concepts inside segwit are not worth pursuing. The disagreement is mostly over priority. 
Although after 3 years of stalling, misinformation and lies, those hard-core on the big block side understandably no longer trust the goals and intentions of those controlling the core project. 
I personally am on the fence with regards to the method of increasing the block size, however I am 100 percent in the "block size should have already increased by now" camp. 
And calling segwit a block size increase misses the point. If we'd spent the last 3 years discussing how to increase the block size safely, planning for a hard fork, then the conversation right now would be very different.

As someone whose efforts to discuss have been censored, I call "shenanigans". I'm talking censorship, not moderation.  And there is a difference.






And here we go.  It's the two-faced nature of this discussion that gets me.  Core = SegWit = good.  BU = crazies = bad.  Why are SegWit supporters free to promote SegWit on this forum, but BU supporters are not?  And don't give me any of that nonsense about "hard fork bad, soft fork good".  If we can't talk about a hard fork, then we can't talk about ways to make a hard fork less bad, discuss how long is "long enough" to get the network on board.  We can't gauge support for a capacity-increasing hard-for,, because talking about it is an "alt coin" and is "moderated" away.  We can't talk about the pros and cons of the various options, because "SegWit=good, all else = bad".




No doubt. I'm guilty of throwing out an insult or two myself, out of frustration.  Frustration borne of all I said above.
But whatever our disagreements, I do thank you for engaging in a reasonable manner!
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:03:07
- Because people who support BU or other scaling solutions haven't been free to speak their minds on this sub
- Because people who support BU or other scaling solutions are often called shills, accused of being paid off, or otherwise denigrated for holding opinions that don't conform to the "approved" view
- Because constantly being denigrated, spoken down to, and called names for one's views gets tiring and shortens one's nerves
- Because calling BU and other scaling solutions "altcoins" is offensive, especially to those of us who have been supporters of bitcoin for many years
- Because the sub that we all retreated to, because we were literally driven out of this sub by the moderation team, with the implicit support (possibly until very very recently) of the core dev team, is constantly insulted by Core supporters 
In short, the censorship (no, not moderation, censorship) on this sub has torn the community apart, and an ever progressing escalation of hostilities, aided by well-placed agitators and well-meaning idiots on both sides has served to make sure the levels of animosity remain high across the board.

What you say is not unreasonable.  And if what you were saying what was happening, there probably wouldn't be a problem.
Unfortunately it is far from what happens here.  Having been a victim of censorship whilst trying to have a serious discussion about the merits of the various scaling options, I can say categorically that what goes on here too often oversteps what a reasonable person could legitimately call "moderation" and very much into what can only be described as outright censorship.
And it's not like I come here daily picking fights, or trying to boost other scaling solutions or bashing core or segwit.  So it's not a case of me posting so much noise that of course some of it gets "moderated".  I say with utter confidence that what we have been seeing on this sub is outright censorship by any reasonable measure.
But I do thank you for contributing to the discussion today, and allowing it to stand.

God dammit, third time I've tried typing this and mobile reddit keeps eating it. 
Sending a pm defeats the purpose of reddit, we should be having an open discussion. 
What is happening now in bitcoin (code and community) is an utterly predictable reaction to the behaviour of those in positions of power, especially given the nature of those attracted to bitcoin in the first place. 
The actions of some actors on both sides of the argument are despicable, but that too is a reflection of the schism that has been created, and nurtured, by those in positions of power. 
Professional agitators aside, there are real users with real concerns for the future of bitcoin, who have been alienated by those are in control of the direction of the project. And their response - to rally behind a fork that appears to be taking their concerns seriously, should be understandable to anyone that cares to think about it.

Yep. Satoshi sure was a genius, his ability to predict exactly what block size limit the network could handle, several years ahead of time, was remarkable.

Nice job putting thoughts in my head. 
I don't know where I got the mistaken impression that the temporary block size limit was described by Satoshi as an anti spam measure, but I know for sure it was before came into existence. 
But that does not change the fact that it was introduced as a temporary measure (something you keep skirting around).

That this post is needed disgusts me. That simple solutions are available but aren't implemented is even worse.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:15:15
It's kinda both.
The computational power needed to solve the SHA256 algorithm also secures the transactions. 
I urge you to research elsewhere, but here's my understanding.
The transactions are put into a block and the block is hashed.  The block includes two special extra pieces of information - the hash of the previous block (hence a "chain" of blocks - the blockchain) and a nonce (random number).  By changing the nonce you change the hash of the block, and the value of the hash itself is part of the "difficulty" - only hashes above (or below - can't remember) a certain value are accepted by the network).
This is the proof-of-work that underlies the security of Bitcoin.  But again, i urge you to read up on the numerous online resources to gain a deeper understandin.

It's easy to say that in hindsight.
In 2010 and 2011 it was hard to get.  Maybe you throw some coffee money at it when it was sub $1 because hey, moon shot.  Do you know for sure you wouldn't have cashed out at $30?  Or 230?  Or even more likely, when it crashed down from either of those highs?
In 2012 there were some exchanges around, but mostly MtGox.  Maybe you throw some spare money at it.  But maybe you cash out at 266 or 1000?  Maybe you keep your coins on MtGox?  Maybe you lose interest in it when it crashes from $1000 and goes into a 2 year bear market?  Maybe your favourite exchange disappears and finding a new one is just a pain, so you lose interest.
Like they say, the best time to buy bitcoin was in the past, the second best time is today.  And they also say never invest more than you can afford to lose.

That is your opinion and you are entitled to it.  Some think that the "temporary" block size limit that was added many years ago,  when blocks were routinely under 100k, should be removed - that preparations to remove it should have been started years ago.

As it stands today, a modern phone could hold the blockchain. I think the idea that a modest increse would "price me out of the market" is fanciful. 
As for the bandwidth,  again,  I find the idea that a modest increase in blocksize would leave a  user with half decent modern bandwidth unable to run a full node hard to swallow. Just because the blockchain fits on a phone doesn't mean we need people with the bandwidth and cpu of phones to run full nodes. 
More users means more businesses,  means more nodes. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:26:54
Glad you mentioned the 21 million limit. Because you will see that nowhere in his writings does he discuss the way the limit can ir should be changed in the future. And yet he does discuss how to go about removing the 1mb limit. 
You are guilty of the same thing you claim I am guilty of. The limit was clearly temporary, yet you claim that we cannot change it.  Clinging to the status quo with no good reason other than that it's the status quo is no better than making a change for the sake of change. Just like I cannot know the mind of Satoshi, neither can you. Any argument that relies on his reasons for adding the limit is flawed on both sides. 
What cannot be denied is that the limit was supposed to be temporary. 
However those of us who think that the block size limit should be algorithmically determined, an emergent property of the network, believe that the current status quo is harmful to bitcoin. Therefore changing the limit should happen, needs to happen.

We will need big blocks eventually, people can't get into second layer solutions if the block size isn't there. 
If btrash had been the culmination of a 12 plus month plan to hard fork, I would have sold my core coins instead of selling my btrash.

How can you justify this?  Any of this?


And yet Bitcoin as coffee money or e-cash is exactly how we got here today.  8 years on, and barring recent "developments" such as full blocks and a "fee market", and Bitcoin has been exactly what you deride - coffee money and e-cash.


This is a ludicrous position.  Cash is very "secure-able".  Humans have become pretty good at physical security over the last few thousand years.


You are ignoring the fact that for a good slice of history, gold was "gold" and "money" at the same time.  There was no distinction.  It's only in relatively modern times that we abstracted away the physical gold from the "money", and very recently that the two were entirely severed.  To say that gold can't be money is to deny much of human history.


This is false, and I put it to you that the converse is true.  You cannot forward plan a "gold 2.0".  Well, you can try, but nobody will accept it.  What you can forward plan is a good digital money, and because of its usefulness as money, it will come to be valued as a store of value (ie. gold) over time.  


And again I put it to you that the converse applies - by reducing the usefulness of Bitcoin as money, you undermine its ability to act as a store of value.  The usefulness of money comes from the network effects, which comes from people using it as money.  You lose the network, you lose the value.  If one crowds out monetary usage, the value will be destroyed.

Heck no, but again good job putting words and thoughts in my head. 
I am saying that something other than a hard coded limit is a better solution. 
Satoshi basically said as much himself when he talks about changing the limit. He acknowledged that the value *will* change, and talks about how he would go about it. 
Quite obviously, if you *have* to change a value, being able to do so without deploying a hard fork is a better way of doing it. 
Say what you want about Satoshi, but a brilliant software engineer he wasn't. And what we have here is a software engineering shortcut that somehow has become a holy grail for everyone that thinks blocks should be small forever.

It's my understanding that the law is related to the "intrinsic" value of the coinage (ie. The metal content).

If nothing useful was solved then nobody would be using it.  The fact that people use it (speculation aside) shows that it's useful, and it solves real problems.  To deny this is to deny reality.


And yet here we are, 8 years on into an experiment in e-cash, that was until very recently perfectly capable of being used as coffee money.




You appear to be conflating security of the asset to security of value. Disingenuous to talk about these two very different things at the same time.




If I have no idea what you are talking about then it is because you have failed to communicate effectively.  You keep saying "gold can't be money" as if saying it often or loud enough will make it true.  Until 1971, gold was money (although paper notes were a proxy).  There are still people alive today whom for the majority of their lives, gold was actually money.


Here you go leading with your conclusion again.  And please avoid accusing me of ad-hominem attacks.




Appeal to authority much?  I have a proof, but it's too long to fit here and you wouldn't understand it anyway.




What on earth are you on about?  It wasn't that long ago that, according to some, "accepted science" said that Bitcoin should not have any value at all.  Again with the appeals to authority.


Seems we have very little common ground with which to have a discussion, except for your last line, which I have little choice but to echo wholeheartedly.

No it's not. It betrays a huge lack of awareness of how much energy other aspects of our society uses. From the 747 example posted in this thread by Hines to the huge companies in the financial system that merely exist to be trusted intermediaries between third parties, to the governmental and regulatory agencies who solely exist to ensue that trusted intermediaries don't cheat. There are huge parcels of the economy whose sole purpose is to make sure that the numbers add up - sectors that don't exist in bitcoin because they are not needed.

If I'm not mistaken, people closer to the issue did some proper measurement and worked out that the network could handle 4MB blocks just fine, and that was before the introduction of thin blocks and what not.

If you update your ledger wallet, next time you log in and choose "legacy" (instead of btrash) you will be given a choice of segwit or... Not segwit. 
So if you want to use segwit, you can log in to the segwit wallet, get a receiving address, then log in to the "normal" wallet, and send some coins to your segwit address. 
Fees are very low at the moment, so now is a good time to do that. 
Be aware that if you send all your coins at once, you will be funnelling all your wallet contents into a single address, damaging anonymity. 
I sent some of mine the other day with fees in the 5 satoshi per byte and lower range, some have confirmed as of yesterday, others were still pending.

Well that's the argument isn't it? 
You're talking duffel bags of cash (presumably you're not in Venezuela). I'm talking about buying a coffee. 
Right  now, sometimes  congestion on the network makes the latter impossible, but the former is fine. 
I don't think that anyone could honestly argue against the assertion that the block size limit is now occasionally making some kinds of payments uneconomical. 
Assuming adoption increases, this floor of value that can be economically transacted on-chain will rise. On-chain scaling solutions are absolutely needed, and needed now (arguably needed 12 months ago). 
I'm all for layer 2 solutions that add value. I'm not for forcing people on to layer 2 by restricting the growth of the base layer.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:17:43
That's not as easy as it sounds. There are no guarantees that any particular node will see the same backlog of transactions as any other node. 
Still, there is in theory nothing stopping any particular node from refusing to relay an empty or near empty block when that node's mempool is full. Ditto for miners building on top of an empty block. 
Wonder if anyone has seriously suggested such an "optimization". 
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:30:51
Not where I live.  Sure, you can pick *which* bank you interact with. But interaction with the banking system (ie "the banks", to use your language) isn't voluntary if you want:
- a house
- a car
- a job
- to pay your bills
If I decide I've had enough of the BS from Bitcoin, I can move to litecoin, or dash, or whatever.  If I decide I've had enough of the BS from the banking system, I'm out of luck.
The importance of the voluntary nature of interaction with Bitcoin is nigh impossible to overstate, IMHO.

That would be a great tragedy. 
I guess it's a race between the network effect of Bitcoin and its first mover advantage, against the (lack of)  scaling of the network (plus layers above).
When enough people get sick of high transaction fees and slow confirmations,   they have a choice between higher layer solutions and another crypto.  
I personally think that the higher layer solutions should provide a value add above and beyond the blockchain (eg micro payment, instant payment, multisig security ) rather than simply providing a refuge for those priced off the blockchain. 
I object to what appears to me to  be an effort to force people off the blockchain and on to (as yet unavailable) higher layers by the price of access  alone.
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:44:01
Wow you are something aren't you. 
SegWit *Is* a block size increase. It's not a done deal yet, but there is a good chance it will be activated. Therefore block size will increase. And to suggest that it's going to be the only increase is ridiculous. 
You use a lot of words to convey very little information. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:52:21

@_date: 2016-12-14 00:42:51
That is the aim, in my mind. The idea that we have to be able to do that today or never is ridiculous. 
We can grow in time. The point here is that growth is being stifled by an arbitrary limit that, when put in place was an order of magnitude larger than the actual network usage. If the block size cap was kept at an order of magnitude larger than the actual network usage, we'd be over 10Mb in Max  block size today, and it's anybody's guess what size blocks would actually be. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:11:11


That certainly appears to be the goal of some. I would argue that it's not necessary. 
Yes people that pay deserve priority over those that don't. Miners always have the choice what to include in their blocks. 
Block size will increase, it's a fact. SegWit is a defacto Increase. More will come. The question is how many, when,  in what form, and more importantly who decides. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:33
BIP 141 (segwit) was created December 2015.
Segwit compatible bitcoin core (for mainnet) was released on 27 October 2016 (version 0.13.1).
Command line support for segwit addresses was released 14 September 2017 (0.15.0).
My ledger supported segwit within a week of activation if memory serves. 
I think it's a little hypocritical to give coinbase and blockchain.info shit for not supporting segwit when the reference implementation's wallet gui still doesn't either.

@_date: 2016-12-13 21:21:06
Ok, who are you to decide that a micro payment is a coffee. 
I am no expert in the field of payments, but it's my understanding that micro payments refers to payments measured in cents rather than dollars (and nano payment is fractions of a cent). 
Nobody has seriously argued that on chain micro payments were ever part of the scope of bitcoin. From memory Satoshi himself said in forum posts that layer 2 solutions for micro payments were the logical solution. 
Your straw man argument is obvious and an insult to us all. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:48:06
No argument here. 
However there are two ways to get fees to miners. You suggest high fees on (implied) a small number of transactions. 
The other alternative is lower fees on a larger number of transactions. 
I think layer two is absolutely needed, but I think it should provide added value (eg micro payment, or instant confirmation). Reduced cost of layer 2 should be a second benefit, not a primary driver. Forcing people on to (as yet unbuilt) layer two solutions strikes me as killing the golden goose.

I object because, if it wasn't clear from my original post, the expensive, slow Bitcoin we have now isn't what I believe I signed up for when I first discovered Bitcoin. 
Why don't you object to forcing people off chain? How many potential users are you willing to sacrifice to keep this hypothetical edge case node running that would quit if the block size doubled? 
How many more nodes would we have if the user base of Bitcoin doubled? I believe the answer is "more than we'd lose". 
But hey, a decentralised trustless layer two solution sounds great, I look forward to the date it arrives. In the meantime, we have users we're turning away for the want of a few Mb every 10 minutes.

@_date: 2016-12-14 02:02:30
Agreed. It's the "prematurely" part that gets stuck in my craw. People have been pointing to the need for on chain scaling for a couple of years at least. Full blocks and blown out transaction fees and confirmation times could have (should have?)  been avoided. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:47:34
OK I'll bite.
We're talking every person in the world using Bitcoin for every transaction &gt; $X value.
Firstly: What value of X do YOU think is right?  
Secondly: What scaling solutions are YOU thinking we should take to get us one step closer? 
Me, I think we should go with SegWit, and remove the hard-coded block size limit in such a way that a hard fork is never again required for basic on-chain scaling.  Further block size increases should be at worst soft forks, at best dynamic.
As for X, I think anything that is currently economical with a credit card should be fair game for on-chain Bitcoin, but cheaper.  So, let's a $0.20 fee makes anything over $20 "worth doing on chain".

Indeed. The voluntary nature of Bitcoin is both a strength and a weakness. If Bitcoin can't provide what people need, people will use something else. I don't want people to choose something else, I want them to choose Bitcoin because it is the best solution.

If we're ever at the point where I have to deposit my salary with a LN provider to be able to "use Bitcoin"  (which isn't far past your suggestion of dumping a months worth of coffee money into a prepay with my favourite coffee place) then we've already lost. I doubt it would get there, the friction inherent in your scenario would, I am sure, drive people to other solutions long before it got that bad. 
I joined Bitcoin for the digital trust less peer to peer electronic cash that it offered. If it stops being that, other systems will start to look good.

I reject your implications that moving from 1Mb to 2, 4, or even 8 today will jeopardise the entire project.

Growth of what?! 
Of Bitcoin! Of the user base. Of transaction volume and value. Pretty straight forward stuff I think. 
Yes micro payment needs to be off chain. It was never supposed to be on chain. 
The zero conf payment for lunch or coffee, that was always on the border, you could do it but better solutions will come along. But those solutions need to be better because they add value, not because you can't afford the transactions fees, or your transaction times out.

Satoshi clearly talks about peer to peer payment between buyers and sellers in the white paper. In my mind the implication here is for a traditional purchase of a good or service (rather than say paying for the next few seconds of a video, or for a single view of a Web page).

OK, I need to unpack this.  What I was saying was that an event that would push BTC to $100k in the next 6 months would have to be of the order of size/severity as a US Govt debt default.
If the US Govt did default on its debt, then BTC could quite easily go to $100k.  However, how much would $100k buy you, do you think?  A lot less than it would today, that's for sure.
So, it may not necessarily make BTC that much more valuable (in Euro or Yen), but in USD terms, hodlers would be much better off than the USD bag-holders.  However if you imagine the turmoil that this event would cause, I think everyone would take a bit of a hit ( at least initially).
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:26:31
Bitcoins value isn't from it just being another payment network. It's not from it being just another store of value. It's not even from it being programmable money.
The value comes from its distributed, censorship resistant nature. From its permissionless innovation model. From its immutability. Putting a number on these things, especially when you live in the first world, is difficult. But they obviously have value. 


What I mean is that your transaction does not have to be one input, two outputs. You can spend multiple inputs (aggregating smaller uxto). Yes the uxto set will grow over time, like I said, and it's a concern for scaling, possibly even more so than block size.

Re: Block 481824 - that's the block number where S2X forks.  By definition (according to the S2X rules), that block is going to be bigger than 1MB, making it incompatible with Bitcoin.  And because S2X block 481824 is invalid on Bitcoin, the block reward from that block is also invalid on bitcoin.
Hope that makes sense.
Of course, S2X block 481825 will also be invalid on Bitcoin (because it will reference S2X block 481824).  But the transactions inside the blocks will likely mostly still be valid in Bitcoin (hence the "replay" aspect of replay protection).

A malicious miner (or pool) doesn't need to spam the network with transactions. They can, of course. And they will get back the fees that they themselves mine.
But they can also mine full blocks that contain made up transactions (transactions to themselves)  if they want to. High fee transactions no less.  The net effect is similar to spamming the network directly - pushes up fees and reduces throughput.

On balance, the cost of mining a bitcoin will equal the value of that bitcoin, plus a return on capital.  If the energy consumption of the bitcoin network surpasses the energy production of Denmark, that means the value of the bitcoin network will be greater than the economic output of Denmark.  Seems like a reasonable trade-off to me.


Where do you live that governments don't tax the profits of corporations or individuals today?


Unlikely - scaling solutions will continue to be added (of which SegWit was merely the first).


Yes, as bitcoin value goes up, denominations of bitcoin transactions go down.  Transaction costs are based on transaction size, which is generally independent on the value of the transaction.  The two issues here are orthogonal.


There are many here that subscribe to the Austrian school and similar notions, whereby inflation is not considered to be a good thing.  Keynesian economic theory is generally not well regarded 'round these parts.

You'd think so, but you would be wrong. If you were able to mine at 30 % less power cost, that increased profit would encourage you to invest more in mining, increasing your power consumption. Plus, the cost of mining is what secures the network. 


Indeed. Hence why, despite being primarily a supporter of bigger blocks, I am anti btrash. The decentralised, permission less, uncensorable nature of bitcoin is what gives it value. Miner controlled verwu asicboost coin is rubbish, price pump or no. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:29:06


Maybe not.  But if BTC is using $X worht of power, then it's gotta be worth $X (give or take) to the people using it, because that cost is coming from somewhere.


A tax is a tax is a tax.  If price of energy goes up, if there is a tax on bitcoin mining specifically, whatever it is, the market will adjust.  What's your point here?


Any idea how much energy the financial sector uses?  


No, but kinda.  You can aggregate UTXO, and besides BTC is not infinitely divisible.  But you have stumbled upon another issue with scaling - UTXO set bloat.  Something rarely talked about, but something that will be a problem as BTC value rises and, as you say, average UTXO size shrinks.

For one, I believe it's patented. An "efficiency boost" (not that that's what asicboost is - it's an exploit) only helps the network if everyone has access to it.  
Further to this, efficiency (of the entire network) does not matter. One miner being more efficient than others matters to the individual miners, as it affects their profitability greatly, but it does not help the network. 
For two, the use of covert asicboost precludes not just segwit, but other future upgrade paths that will rely on changes to the block header (is my understanding).

It's the lack of explicit two-way replay protection in S2X that's the "problem" here.
There is going to be implicit replay protection available.  On block 481824, S2X miners will mine a block &gt;1MB base blocksize.  This block will be invalid on the Bitcoin chain.
Therefore the transactions mined in block 481824, and more importantly the coinbase (block reward), won't be valid on Bitcoin.  Additionally the block reward in block 481824 on Bitcoin won't be valid on S2X.
If you mix your transaction with Bitcoin-only coins, your transaction won't be replayable on S2X, and if you mix S2X coins with your S2X txn, your transaction won't be replayable on Bitcoin (This is, I believe, what Ledger are proposing to allow users of their wallet/harware to do to enable splitting of coins).


So, no.




No.  There will be two chains.

If I read correctly, segwit changes the block header content in a specific way. Asicboost (the covert way)  relies on the block header being a particular different way. The header is what's hashed during mining. Thus they can't work together.

The laptop must be old, otherwise it would have no problem running a bitcoin full node.  My 6 year old PC was running a full node until recently - the truly shitty quality of my DSL service, and bitcoinQT repeatedly crashing and taking the entire blockchain with it is why it's stopped.

Segwit moves some stuff out of the block, but miners (and full nodes) still have to get that data to process and validate blocks. It behaves as a block size increase because it shrinks the size of the new segwit transactions (by moving the signature data out of the block).

Segwit leads to, from what I have read an approximate equivalent of double block size, but only if a significant proportion of the network upgrades to use segwit. So we're talking a maximum of 4Mb block with segwit+2Mb. 
If *they* were serious about a block size increase they could put it in as a long dated hard fork *tomorrow*.  
As for what is wrong with this route, "when the network is ready" allows the increase to be postponed until it's urgent, which makes it too late given what has to happen around a hard fork. Put the hard fork in place now with a suitable time horizon, give everyone enough time to deal with the consequences under threat of being left behind if they don't make the necessary arrangements, and I think we'll all be surprised at what can be achieved when the alternative is to go broke. 
"when it's ready for it " rarely works in the real world of software engineering in my experience. Without a hard deadline, there is always something else to be done, something cooler or more urgent, more discussion to be had, more arguments, more of everything except getting the job done.

On that point we can agree.  The only difference is, the people that agree with you are allowed to speak freely. The people that disagree aren't. 
If core had conceded the need for a block size increasing hard fork two years ago, when every man and his dog that didn't have blinders on saw that it was necessary, it'd be ready to go live by now.  
The failure lies at the feet of the core team. If the hard fork block size increase was such a bad idea, it should have been debunked clearly, honestly and openly. Instead those with contrary opinions were insulted, belittled, and silenced. 
You still seem unable to understand that what is happening now was both predicable and inevitable.

@_date: 2016-02-22 01:03:50
There is no "throughput" of zero conf transactions, at least as it relates to the block size.  The "throughput" of zero conf transactions is whatever rate the network nodes can relay them, and the capacity is however much mempool is available to store them.
Throughput only makes sense in reference to confirmations, because confirmations are limited to a probabilistic interval that averages 1 block every 10 minutes.  
Doubling the size of the block doubles the maximum number of transactions that could be confirmed in a given time period - scaling the capacity by a factor of 2.  Changing block size does nothing to zero conf, except by the fact that increasing the block size will arguably allow/encourage more people to use Bitcoin, increasing the overall number of transactions.

I disagree.
Overt asicboost is simply using the unused version bits as a second nonce. Miners can do something similar today by fiddling with the low bits of the timestamp. 
Covert asicboost uses hash collision in the low 4 bytes of the Merkel root* to avoid work. 
Given that the point of proof of work is to prove that work was done, using hash collisions to avoid work is not the same as doing work on bits that technically you should not change, but you can probably do so without Ill effect.

Like I said, and you seem to have not read, I've been there. I experienced the internet being virtually unusable when the node was running (and this was even before the blocks got consistently full). 
If nbn wasn't coming soon I'd consider paying for a second connection (satellite, terrestrial, doesn't matter) just to run a node. But it is, so I wait.

@_date: 2017-09-20 08:28:30
That's true. But at that point, the miner is choosing between including real fee paying transactions, and including fake transactions. At this point they aren't just figurative leaving money on the table, they are literally leaving money on the table. 
As for filling blocks with bogus txn, This is a choice they make every day, every block. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:12:11
What if several major pools stated something along the lines of : we will refuse to mine on top of empty blocks, if our mempool contains enough transactions to fill a block at the fee rate of the previous non empty block, if that empty block arrives within one minute of the previous block.
I'd say that would be pretty strong financial incentive... 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:10:37


Yes, but if you fill a block with fake transactions, you are quite literally leaving money on the table.   You take the downside that comes from a full block - propagation delay and validation delay, for example - but you receive none of the benefits (ie. real txn fees).  Well, you can still asicboost an empty block....


I remain unconvinced.  Your arguments are unconvincing.
Frankly every participant on the network is free to impose whatever rules they like, and as long as they don't stray from consensus, it's all good.  Nodes can set the minimum fee for txn relay, why can't they set minimum block size for relay?  Miners can choose what txns to include in a block, miners can choose whether or not to build on any given block.

Today you learned : you're a moron.
Don't feel bad. The first step is knowing that you have a problem. 
First you need to learn the difference between download limits, and bandwidth. 
I could post my speed test results. I can get 4Mbps down on a perfect day, and half that on an average day. On a good day I can get 50kbps up on a perfect day, half on an average day. 
If you think that's enough to run a full node, and have a household full of people (including kids that just love YouTube) also use the internet in a manner that doesn't make one feel like punching a screen, well, see the first line of my reply.  And forget about trying to work from home too.
So now I'm limited to running a full node between midnight and 7am.  Which frankly isn't worth my hassle to set up. I'm waiting for the nbn to arrive in my street, going to pray that I won't have the problems that I hear so many people are having (people I actually know, not just sensational news pieces), and then I'll resume running a full node (I say resume because I used to - until the complaints from the rest of the household about the poor internet performance became too loud to ignore). 
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:16:20
You forgot to mention that the spammers have a shitcoin to support. If they mine their shitcoin, then others miners can collect their spam transaction fees. If they mine bitcoin to get their txn fees back, they will let their shitcoin die, so they prove that the "big blocks or die" movement was a sham.
So spamming now has a very real cost to them, in both literal monetary terms and in ideological terms. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:00:26
Holy shit, do you even read what you write?  Or what I write?
Do you not think that if a proportion of miners and nodes refused to relay or build on empty blocks when the mempool is full, then that would change the behaviour of those mining empty blocks when the mempool is full (excluding a grace period straight after a block is found of course)?
FFS we have miners today that choose to mine on btrash at significant opportunity cost, for what I can only presume are ideological reasons.  Why couldn't miners on bitcoin choose to ignore late empty blocks when under load for the same reason?  Explain how that wouldn't help.  Explain how that wouldn't encourage miners (in their own self interest) to not mine empty blocks.

@_date: 2017-09-21 12:00:23
OK, we're speaking the same language at least.
Yes, a bad miner can spam the blockchain with private transactions if other miners refuse to mine on empty blocks.   I see two reasons they don't now - first is because of orphan risk, second is because they aren't interested in bloating the blockchain.  
While spamming private transactions would bloat the blockchain, you are also increasing orphan risk of the bad miner (who currently has as-close-to-zero-as-can-be orphan risk).  And it increases the chances of fucking it up from zero to nonzero (like that failed asicboost block we got a while back).
Is the trade-off worth it?  I dunno.  Maybe?

Close but not quite.  I'm saying that the miners have spent the last two years running a temporary small-block fix that is (according to some) obsolete and harmful to their interests.
I was responding originally to your (apparently rhetorical?) question regarding miners acting against their own interests, and pointing out that some say that that's what they've been doing (and possibly you agree).
As to your assertion that miners have spent the last two years wanting larger blocks and core has been  ignoring them, I'd suggest that the lack of support for BitcoinXT, BIP109/102/101, BitcoinUnlimited etc. makes me doubt exactly how much or how badly the miners want larger block sizes.
Given recent soft-fork improvements to bitcoin (eg CLTV), it wouldn't have been too hard for a coalition of the willing (miners) to put their foot down and demand a block size increase in exchange for supporting protocol upgrades, even if only by dedicating a small token proportion of their hash power to a 'protest vote'.  And that's just using on-chain methods to indicate their opinions.  How hard would it be for these ignored miners to tell core directly "put out a hard fork release now, or we will"?
The world isn't short of software developers.  The idea that the current set of core developers are the only ones up to the task of maintaining bitcoin is offensive.
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:35:55
If you are selling because you are scared that the price went down, then you neither understand the technology nor the reason bitcoin exists, in which case I say to you in the nicest possible way "don't let the door hit you on the way out".
But tell me this, were you one of the "if only" crowd on the way up? If only I'd discovered it sooner, if only I'd bought more, if only I was around for the bear market in 2015, if only, I'd be rich.
Well guess what. In two, three, five years, there will be another batch of if-onlyers, but they'll be saying "if only I'd been here at the start of 2018, I'd have bought big and now lambo". So here you are, now, in the middle of the future's "if only" moment. And you need to decide, do you believe in the technology and promise of bitcoin? Or are you just another "if only" person, with nothing but hindsight and not a single bit of foresight.

Definitely high risk high reward. However I think most shitcoin investors are grossly underestimating the risk side of the equation.
Sure, a sub dollar shitcoin might go to the moon (say $1M), but I'd estimate that the chances of some random shitcoin replacing bitcoin in the tens of millions to one against. You'd be better off buying a powerball ticket. And putting the rest in bitcoin.

No.  Slicing bitcoin into fractions of a Satoshi (currently the smallest unit) won't increase the total number of bitcoin in circulation.

Yeah, I'm with you there.  Somehow optional soft forks are coercive (so optional that only 30% or thereabouts of the network is using segwit), yet hard forks are voluntary (everyone who wanted to use btrash *had* to upgrade to the recent 32Mb update).

Maybe the HF crowd has support because they saw the capacity problems coming years ago, and know that the fear mongering about 1MB blocks being too big and hard forks being oh so dangerous is more propaganda than truth? 
But you are Still skirting the issue. 
Everyone acknowledges that the initial capacity bump from segwit will be minor as it requires new software and wallets to make use of it. In that sense it helps nobody immediately. Hf helps everyone immediately. 
If core had put a block number based hard fork base size increase in their initial release of segwit, or if they had put a "segwit plus X months" base increase (similar to the current proposal?) then I am pretty confident we'd already be running segwit.

It *should* be. But it isn't, it wasn't, and won't be. 
If "science" said definitely that somehow the magical one million byte limit that was put in place years ago was somehow *still* the exact right value for today, and for the next six or twelve months, there would only be a fringe group of obvious nut cases arguing for larger block size. 
But it's not science. It's opinion. And opinion is political. 
I don't disagree that hard forking merely for a block size increase is suboptimal. But you can thank the core team for that. They are the ones who failed to sell their scaling vision to the community.

You are happy to sacrifice everyone that has transactions stuck in the mempool, require them to move those coins to a segwit address (how, given the transaction backlog). 
Sure, once everyone is holding segwit coins then there will be more capacity. But that does nothing for people trying to use bitcoin right now. Think maybe that's why the HF block size increase crowd has support maybe?  
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:47:25
Agreed. But at this stage things are so toxic and divided, a simple hard fork is likely the only thing that has a hope of getting activated.

Indeed. I was talking more about the fact that segwit only provides a limited scaling solution initially.

Which is false.

That context being that I was saying that the idea that a limit chosen 6 years ago is still the correct limit is laughable (clearly implying that the limit is too small).  Therefore by the power of deduction and reasoning, it's clear that I think that advocating for a *lower* limit is as laughable, if not borderline ridiculous.

No, you don't get it. You just need an account at Gold Money, and then you simply have to trust them that they'll hold your hold for you. Then you can trust that when you ask them to "transfer" 0.1g of gold to someone, they will update their database and decrease your holding and increase the other person's holding by that amount.
Then all you need to do is trust that they won't screw up, won't get hacked, won't leak your private information, won't give away or sell your private information to anyone who asks (even at gunpoint), and won't give anyone else your gold (even at gunpoint). 
So much easier, and better, because gold has Intrinsic Value.

If one were to squint at this through the most charitable lenses in existence, one might interpret that as follows :

Not really. I mean, yes of course, high fees and backed up transactions are keeping users away. 
But lightning can't scale to all that many users, with a 1mb block size. Channels need to be opened and closed - those transactions have to be on chain.  Even if your only on chain transactions are your salary going into your lightning channel monthly, do the maths : 224 bytes for a transaction gives you 4464 txn per block. 4320 blocks per month, that's less than 20 million users. 
Obviously I haven't accounted for the smaller transaction sizes of segwit transactions, but the commonly cited figure is 1.8x, so be generous and you have 40 million users. And all you can do on the network is fund your lightning channel every month. 
Obviously nobody knows how many bitcoin users there are, but you can guess (
 
Anyway, the point remains - lightning scales the number of transactions each user can make. Getting users off chain makes room for more users, but at the end of the day, each new user needs some base block space for them to be able to use bitcoin.

I would say calling anything "over the counter", that you can pick up and walk out of the store with a "small purchase" is a reasonable guide.
It's not relevant because the window for a successful double-spend without spending millions on hardware is small.  Entirely not worth it for a "small purchase".
And whilst some alt-coins claim to have a faster block rate to "fix" this perceived problem, none of them have block rates in the order of single-digit seconds that would (to the ignorant only) fix the problem you have described.  And it would only be for the ignorant, because super-fast confirmations bring other problems such as long forks and lots of orphaned blocks, due to network propagation delays.
For example, litecoin targets 2.5 minute blocks, which is still an age if you are waiting to walk away with your coffee and donut.

In some (if not many) jurisdictions there is the concept of "theft by finding".  If you find something of value lying in the street, the case of "finders/keepers vs losers/weepers" does not hold much weight.  You are obligated to either turn the property in to the authorities and allow them to find the rightful owner, or try to find the rightful owner yourself.  Eventually, should the owner not appear or be found, you can claim ownership.
Sweep the coins into a safe* address controlled by you. Then as mentioned above, try to contact the owner.  Post here, post on bitcointalk, and send a few mBTC to the address with a message (maybe make the message a brand new email address you set up just for this purpose).
Then to prove ownership, get the person who gets in touch with you to sign a message using the address the coins were held on.  
Do NOT tell anyone the passphrase you used to generate the key, or anyone could claim ownership.  In fact, given that you guessed the passphrase, there is a good chance this could happen.  
If the owner of the coins doesn't get in touch with you for, say, 6 months, then it's probably reasonable to assume the coins are now yours.
*Please make sure the address is safe.  Not a brain-wallet.  Not an online wallet.  A wallet created offline from a non-internet-connected computer.

Yes.  From memory started with a drop to 300kB.  But that has nothing to do with anything, because you said


Now clearly, Luke-Jr thought 300kB was the right size for today (or the day he wrote the BIP).  And with an increasing block size, that block size would have eventually equalled 1MB.  Therefore, not only does Luke-JR think that the 1MB block size is too big for today, he also thinks it'll likely be the right size (if briefly) some time in the future.
So by your own logic, Luke-Jr is a fevered-dreaming numpty.  Good to know.


The writing is on the wall for *all* blockers of scalability.  And agree wholeheartedly, it's about time.

I also kept a backup of my paper wallet (pdfs) on a USB stick - but encrypted.
Try reversing the situation.  Imagine you print your paper wallets from your "regular" PC, over wifi to your printer.  And backup your PDFs unencrypted.
How would you feel if your contents were swept next week?  Next month?  Next Year?  Next Bubble?

Leaving them on an online wallet or exchange on the 31st of July is quite possibly the most dangerous thing you could do with your coins, short of sending them to that nice price from Nigeria who just needs some money to grease the palms of the local officials so he can get a suitcase full of gold out of the country and give you your share.

Peter Schiff really should think twice about *all* of his objections to Bitcoin.  I think his recent interaction with Erik Vorhees (sp?) showed that he has passed the point of cautious objector and into willful ignorance.
The vast majority of his objections are based on strawman arguments, logical fallacies, and just plain old being wrong.  Not only has he had time to educate himself, he's had intelligent people spend time to try to educate him as well.  That he still fails to grasp the underlying concepts of Bitcoin shows a level of wilful ignorance/intellectual dishonesty that I find incredibly disappointing in someone so intelligent.

Bitcoin is not in any way like a Ponzi scheme.
The lack of central promoter, and the missing secrecy that is usually associated with Ponzi schemes are key differentiators IMO.
You could compare it to a pyramid scheme, in that the returns of those "cashing out" at the top are expected to come from those convinced to buy in.  But unlike a true pyramid scheme, returns are not predicated on the ability for any individual to recruit newcomers.  To me the difference is intent.  By definition newcomers must buy from oldtimers, so that alone is not enough to make it a pyramid - the idea of a pyramid is that the profits of those at the top is explicitly tied to their ability to bring in paying newcomers, IMO.
The most realistic "scam" you could compare Bitcoin to IMO is a plain old bubble.  No central promoters, no hidden agendas, just a lot of people deciding that something is worth more, pushing the price up.  But to be a bubble, you have to get above the "intrinsic value".  What's the intrinsic value of a bitcoin, and what's the intrinsic value of the Bitcoin network?  Those that say zero are deluded or ignorant IMO.

Trading?  Who's trading?  I buy bitcoin, I use bitcoin.  
As for not knowing shit, I think you have outed yourself as being full of it.  The block reward is designed to provide an incentive to miners to convince them to expend resources on securing the network, until such time as the coin economy has grown enough that tx fees become sufficient to do the job of rewarding miners.  
The Quark ~~con~~ coin block reward is to hit 1 coin after 33 weeks (US$100 approx at today's prices) of mining.  Unless Quark goes to the moon in the next few weeks, there will be little financial incentive for anyone to mine.
Frankly, there is little right about Quark.  If you can't see it then you are ignorant (if inadvertent then please educate yourself), or you are in on the **scam** (in which case please refrain from dishing your nonsense around here).

You can mine with a GPU "for fun".
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:44:21
Mining runs your GPU at full speed.  Destroy may be an overstatement, but it will certainly reduce its lifespan.
Unless you have free electricity, GPU mining is unlikely to be worth it - you would be better off to take the money you would spend on power to run your GPU at 100% for a week and just buy bitcoin directly.
There are several online mining profit calculators that you can easily google to get some figures.
However just for the heck of it, to give it a try and collect some dust, and to learn about mining and pools etc, I would recommend giving it a go.

For fast transactions people use zero confirmations with about a five second wait to make the chance of a double spend negligible. 
For high value transactions you wait for enough confirmations such as the cost of performing a 51% attack dwarfs the value of the transaction. 
There's no need for transaction speeds faster than 10 minutes.  It adds no value and only adds cost. 
In theory a different block time may be more optimal depending on the definition of "optimal" you choose to use but I highly doubt it would end up with a block rate significantly different to what it is now.

The only thing that stops this is people believing in bitcoin, and either holding or buying into the crash.
Bitcoin is better off with people that believe and are in for the long haul and better of without people that are in for a quick buck and panic at the first sign of a price dip.
Also, if more people panic and bail than stay and commit then bitcoin arguably isn't ready to be at that price level, or even possibly to be what it is supposed to be.
And if a whale were to cash out, cause a panic and buy back in - what would be the point?  Actions like that would cause serious damage to the entire Bitcoin economy.  They may end up with more bitcoins if the plan works out, but those bitcoins would be worth less, possibly zero if the crash/damage is bad enough.

Step 1, do some research into bitcoin.  Understand wallets, addresses, change addresses, and keys.  Understand the different clients.
If you don't want to deal with an exchange, go with a local seller (localbitcoins.com).  Be careful - you are swapping money for ... other money.  You'll probably want a mobile wallet or at least a connection to a site to verify transfer (eg blockchain.info).
You can store your paper wallet as a pdf on a flash drive if you want.  Multiple copies would be safer - choose from multiple flash drives, hard copy, or even a pdf in a truecrypt volume stored on dropbox.  But remember that anyone who gets your private key can spend your coins.
There is a distinction between a paper wallet and a wallet backup.  To me, a paper wallet is a self-contained private key (hidden) and public address that can be given to people.  A wallet backup can be printed (from a client that supports it - bitcoin-qt doesn't) and stored somewhere for safety.

No miner will go out on a limb and mine blocks nobody else will accept.

1. Bitcoin doesn't have a debt-to-equity ratio, because it has no debt and isn't equity.  Similarly it doesn't have a P/E ratio because it has no earnings.  It's a currency and payment system.  
5. Lack of friction in financial transactions is a big potential benefit.  The blockchain can potentially provide irrefutable proof of ownership of things other than bitcoins (by tying ownership of a thing to ownership of a fraction of a bitcoin).  And there are more examples that people are just thinking up.  Bitcoin has a long way to go and a lot of potential to explore.

The way I see it, bitcoin either becomes **the** way of transacting funds electronically, or it becomes worthless.
So assuming it's the dominant method of electronic funds transfer, and assuming a low per-bitcoin price, the only way it could support such a huge transaction volume would be for it to have insane velocity.
And I think such an insane velocity is not likely to happen, because by its very nature people will want to hold on to it.  Heck, if you get paid monthly, half of your salary will be held for at least 2 weeks in a simplistic linear model of spending.
Which leads to the conclusion that it will be worth large amounts, and transactions will be carried out in milli- and micro-bitcoins (or even satoshis).

It would be interesting to see how successful it could be if a bank were to provide OTC bitcoin exchanges.
I also see a future potential for trusted people with the requisite knowledge to provide a safe and secure environment for people to transact bitcoin.  To say that a bank isn't needed for bitcoin is to assume that your grandmother knows how and is capable of setting up a non-internet-connected laptop with a live-CD boot of ubuntu to create an offline paper wallet, to be stored somewhere secure.  
And then when she needs to spend some of her savings, she knows how to create and broadcast an offline transaction based off that paper wallet, that doesn't lose all her money to transaction fees or an unsaved change address.
This is the one of the gaps between the current tech-savy user group of Bitcoin, and the "common man".
This is one of the problems with people "being their own bank".

Also, an unscrupulous operator (not saying you are that unscrupulous) could keep copies of the private keys and spend the sold coins back to himself at the end of the day.  The only safe thing for a buyer to do here is to open the paper wallet on the spot and import the private key and spend them to himself immediately.
I hope you are recommending people to do this as soon as you sell them one of these.  At the very least, for the cost of this overpriced paper wallet, you are educating them on Bitcoin.

Besides being impossible to enforce, it would be disastrous for those attempting to transact in bitcoin.
The network difficulty is changed every 2 weeks (2016 blocks IIRC) and is based on the previous 2 weeks of hashing power, under the assumption that it should take on average 10 minutes to solve a block.
If the hash power devoted to mining dropped from what it is now (5PH for arguments sake) to a pre-asic level (say, 5TH for argument sake), then blocks would take 1000 times longer to mine, meaning we would in all likelyhood not see a single block mined for that entire day.
So not only would the GPU miners not get anything for their efforts, the bitcoin network would be crippled for 24 hours.

IMO, "experts" are experts at "something".  That something has to already be something worth being an expert about.
When something new comes along that isn't like anything else, it's hard to get a hold of mentally.  If you are an expert in something, then you will try to frame your understanding of the new thing in terms of your expertise in the existing something.  For one, being an expert in something is who you are, what you do, and how you make a living - so understanding the new thing in terms of the existing thing also makes sense from a selfish self-preservation point of view.  But for two, because that's how your mind works, and changing that is hard. 
Because the new thing is new, the ability of an expert to grok it will be crippled by their existing world view.  However to someone who has a world view that is less tunnel-vision than an expert, they may find it easier to do the mental gymnastics required to grasp the new idea, and imagine its future.
TL;DR Experts can't predict disruption **because** they are experts in the status quo.

Personally I would think that the savings on credit card fees would be the simple starting point.  Without knowing what starbucks pays for their credit card clearing, it would seem to me that this would be the obvious place to start.  And of course credit card chargebacks, plus whatever delay there is for them to get their cash out of the credit card system.
To me, eBay is more complex.  Ordinarily I'd say the removal of PayPal fees would be the big selling point, but unless I've not kept up with things lately eBay owns PayPal (or is it vice versa), so that is not a selling point.  But PayPal integrates with credit cards, so again you have the credit card fees/chargeback stuff that could be the selling point.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:38:08
I think you're confusing "reserve banking" and "fractional reserve banking". 
If you give me 10 bitcoin for safe keeping and I promise you can have them back whenever you want, and I then loan some of them to someone else, I am now a fractional reserve banking bitcoin bank effectively.  That I did it without your knowledge makes me a lying scumbag, but that's beside the point, and some would argue it's a prerequisite.

Your question is malformed.  You mean the block reward, surely?

Don't "invest" in Bitcoin.  Just use it.  Buy $100 worth and put it on your phone, and then buy stuff using it whenever you have the chance.
Add a little more every pay packet, and if you spend less than you add then you'll slowly accumulate bitcoins.

This, this so much it hurts.  And so many don't get it.  Bitcoin has existed for, what, 4 or 5 years?  We're still in the bootstrapping phase.  Of the many methods built in to the system to assist in the bootstrapping, huge potential upside for early adopters is but one.  Us early adopters are basically VC funding a brand new currency, and if it pays off we get VC-level returns.  And if it tanks, we get wiped out

2.5 minute confirmations mean nothing. For POS applications unconfirmed transactions are the only solution. And for serious transactions the difference between between 10 minute blocks and 2.5 minute blocks is irrelevant. 
As for blocks in seconds, the network propagation delays make me question the usefulness. 
When it comes to security of your transactions the main determining factor is the hash rate.  And the hash rate of the altcoins are a rounding error on the bitcoin hash power. 
The vast majority of altcoins are "me too" efforts or pump and dumps or premine scams. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:16:56
Of course not.  Just like there isn't US$2Tn of capital invested in "the US Dollar".
The problem I have with the market cap figures for bitcoin is that multiplying the last price of a bitcoin by the total number of coins mined thus far is a simplistic measure at best.
For one, lost coins are permanently removed from circulation. In a true M1 measure, lost money is excluded.  But with Bitcoin, short of people volunteering data on lost coins, there is no way to conclusively know how much is lost.

Transactions are validated using the public key infrastructure of bitcoin.
Validated unconfirmed (ie. haven't already been put in a block) transactions are grouped together and put into a block, together with a hash of the previous block, a transaction granting the miner fee to the miner, and a magic number, and that is hashed.
If the hash of the block passes the difficulty test it is broadcast to the network and other miners validate it and then start using that as the basis for the next block.
Once a transaction is in a block like this it has one confirmation.  When the next block is added to the chain then the transactions in the previous block now have 2 confirmations.
There are also transaction fees, so the theory is that when bitcoin is used enough the volume of transaction fees will replace the lost block reward.

Once again confusing Bitcoin with other stuff.  There is no reason in the world an honest exchange should go broke.  Every dollar that goes out has to come in at some stage.  Every dollar that comes in will go out.  If there is a difference that means the exchanges can't pay out, that is because of fraud on the part of the exchanges.  Nothing to do with Bitcoin per se.


The upward trend is driven by there being more buyers than sellers in the market.  Nothing to do with "new" buyers, although new buyers are more than welcome.  That doesn't make it a pyramid scheme.  Nor does it make it a pyramid scheme if everyone holding bitcoins decides to cash out on the same day.  Correction != pyramid scheme.


The current price of most things is inflated value of what it could be.  Every buyer of everything makes the determination of price vs value and decides if the buy is worth making or not.  If I decide the value of a bitcoin to me is worth more than $1000 then that makes today's prices a bargain and I buy more, which also makes me a seller at $1200.  That doesn't make Bitcoin a scam.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:20:23

I see two problems when dealing with Peter.
Firstly, and to me foremostly, is that the people that believe in bitcoin tend to be technophiles.  Talk about blockchains and hashes and p2p and those sort of things will baffle and confuse someone who isn't overtly technologically literate.  The technology needs to take a back seat (it's just an implementation detail after all) to the ideas.
Secondly is his personal gold-bug tunnel-vision.  Calling bitcoin "gold 2.0" is like a red rag to a bull.  If **I** were to discuss bitcoin with someone like Peter Schiff, I would let them define what they want from a currency, and then describe (in low-tech terms) how bitcoin meets those objectives.  If you can get him to admit that bitcoin has something to offer as a free-market medium-of-exchange, then you have hope of convincing him that the other (pretend) flaws he sees are illusory.
That's my 2 satoshi's worth.

They use different algorithms for hashing (ie. verifying/securing the blockchain).
Bitcoin uses SHA256, litecoin uses scrypt.
Bitcoin targets 10 minute blocks, litecoin is faster (can't recall how much faster) - this relates to difficulty adjustments too.
There is less hashing power on the litecoin network, so GPUs can still successfully mine litecoin (in pools).
Litecoin is also much cheaper than bitcoin (US$5 to US$10), but also much less widely used (I believe).

2: I think one confirmation for a $100 transaction is still overkill.  Doublespend detection is still AFAIK an open area that still needs to be serviced.  In theory, any well-connected node can be assured that a double-spend has not been attempted within single digit seconds.  
But I'm not aware of any client that does specific double-spend detection - rather they all just accept the first spend they see, and ignore any double-spend attempt.
If I were a merchant, knowing that my transaction has hit the network would not be enough for me for medium-value ($100+) transactions.  I would also want to know that a double spend has not been attempted.  If I were to compare this to credit cards, it would be akin to checking the signature and asking for another form of ID.

I don't get the problem with early adopters getting gains.
Well, I kind of do, but to me it just betrays ignorance on the behalf of the objector.

If  1e-8 bitcoins  is worth US$1000, then the protocol is changed to add another 8 decimal places.
This would be a small change software-speaking, but a forking change nontheless, so would require a global upgrade.  It (hard fork) has been done before, but not when the average wage is a satoshi per week.  
On the plus side, it's not like one day we'd wake up and bitcoins are suddenly worth a million times more than they were the day before, so there would be plenty of forewarning and chance to plan the upgrade.

The logic you are using here is false, even if the conclusion you come to may be the correct one.
You are investing fiat in Bitcoin.  The question should not be "will I break even in fiat", the question should be "will I break even in bitcoin".
If the $15 you spend would buy you 15mXBT, but you only mine say 10mXBT over the life of the device, then financially you would be better off to have just spent the $15 on bitcoins.

It may be in the form of a QR code representing your private key, or maybe in the form of some random words that can be used to generate your private key, or maybe just a ton of digits.
If you lose that paper, and that paper was your only copy of that private key, then your bitcoin is gone forever.

So, say 100 electrons per bit, by a 256 bit private key...  There are a LOT of bitcoins in an ounce!  :-)

Besides coinjar, localbitcoins could work.

I do in-and-out (cash in, btc out) as fast as possible as a rule.
It means I don't get to capitalise on the dips as much as I would like, but it also means I don't get my funds stolen if an exchange is hacked or closes.

I think their irritation was necessary*.  Peter's demeanour was such as it is when he's lecturing the know-nothings on CNBC.  But the people he was talking at (he wasn't talking to or with them, he was talking at them) were knowledgeable enough to call him out.
When he wouldn't engage properly in a civil discussion and continued to lecture, I think it's reasonable they got frustrated.
*&lt;edit&gt;Maybe not necessary in the strict sense, but entirely understandable.

That's what I thought.  Either they have confused bitcond with a bitcoin miner, or they are just outright anti-bitcoin and using that as an excuse.

Not everybody knows this rule, which would be obvious if you followed the forums or /new.  Between people asking if they should borrow to the hilt to "invest", people lamenting that they lost it all on some shady deal or exchange or marketplace, and plain bad luck causing people to lose most if not all their holdings, it's quite clear that many don't know this rule or don't think it applies to them and/or bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:56:38
I think bitcoin will be valued something between zero and US$1bn.  
In all seriousness, how do you know we're not in the bear trap rather than the bull trap?
Even if bitcoins are destined to reach zero in the next few years, there is no reason it couldn't go for another 10x ATH before it dies.  When bitcoin topped out at $266 not that long ago, people were writing the Bitcoin obituaries, and calling the post-crash bounce a dead-cat-bounce and a bull trap.
If you believe in bitcoin, then this is a good opportunity to buy, because it's cheaper than it was a week ago, and I was buying a week ago.
And if you* don't believe in bitcoin, fine.  Sell your holdings, or put it all on a paper wallet in a draw as a "what-if" lottery ticket.
*by "you" I mean the reader, not the OP, because the OP clearly stated he's in for the long haul and enjoying the ride - just like I am.

They can delete them .  "forgetting" them is one way but there is always a chance that someone somewhere has a backup. 
A better way to delete bitcoins forever is to send them to an address that is valid but which does not have a known private key.  Effectively a random address. 
Even better would be to find an address that is valid but can be shown to be impossible to have a private key - although I don't know if such a thing exists.

Firstly never invest more than you can afford to lose.
If you truly believe in bitcoin and the idea behind bitcoin then ask yourself this: 
If I dropped $16k into bitcoin today, and in a week's time they were at $500, how would I feel?
If the answer is "don't care, I believe in bitcoin and won't stop believing until it goes to zero" then go nuts.
If the answer is more like "man that sucks, I could have bought double" then maybe you should consider dollar-cost-averaging (which is what I've been doing).  Spend, say, $2k per week.  
And finally, spend bitcoin.  On top of your $16k, put some spare cash into bitcoin and then spend it whenver you get the chance.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:12:17
Absolutely.  It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, but the bootstrapping is happening.
Problem is, seems that people like Peter Schiff can't even see the potential of bitcoin.  Or at least, are wilfully ignoring the potential to focus on drawbacks (perceived or real).

And maybe tomorrow they will be worth more.
This may sound harsh but: if you didn't know what you were doing, what you were getting yourself into, then you should have stayed on the sidelines.
Now that you are in, and assuming you didn't put your rent money into bitcoin in the hope of getting rich quick, I suggest you do some research.  Start to learn what Bitcoin is, how it works, what it can be used for.
Maybe you, like me, will start to believe in the ideas behind Bitcoin, which means that you'll start to believe that Bitcoin has a future, a bright future, and what happens tomorrow or next week doesn't really matter.

You're using the word "verify" but that is wrong.  It takes (on average) ten minutes to mine a block.
Transactions are verified as soon as they are broadcast to the network, by every node that sees them.
If a transaction doesn't verify (eg. double spend, trying to spend coins you don't have) then the transaction is not propagated (by honest nodes).
This is why you can accept zero-confirmation transactions after a small amount of time (in the order of a 10 seconds).

Fractional reserve banking can't create new bitcoins because the only way to create bitcoins is by mining. 
But what it will create is a promise to pay bitcoin - your deposit becomes a promise to pay you the bitcoin you deposited. 
Without a central bank to guarantee deposits there will be much more trust required of your bank. Not a bad thing imo.

New change address, not new change wallet.  Think of the wallet containing a private key and a heap of addresses that belong to that private key.
Almost any time you send coins somewhere, there will be change, unless the individual balances of the addresses in your wallet happen to add up to the amount you are sending.
By default change is sent to a new address (owned by you/your wallet of course).  I guess you could look at this as one of the privacy features of Bitcoin.  If your change went back to the originating address then everyone would know exactly how much you have and how much you spent. 
Also for security reasons I believe reusing addresses is advised against.  The recent bug in Android's pseudorandom number generator meant that reusing addresses had the potential to leak information that could allow an attacker to discover your private key, I believe.

Can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to the real debate.

Buy however much mBTC you can afford is the right answer.  Avoid alt-coins.
I have to disagree with the "buy and hold" strategy.  "Buy and spend" is a better one.  The more people spend bitcoins, the stronger Bitcoin gets.  
As for BTC never hitting $200, whilst I agree, I also think that should BTC hit $200 it would be on its way back down to zero.   So remember, never invest more than you can afford to lose.

If someone has the computational firepower to double-spend on a multi-petahash bitcoin network, then they sure as shit have the firepower to double-spend on the litecoin network.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:19:50
I agree.  You gotta pick your audience.  Or you gotta include a small ($5) wallet with a "real" present.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:47:34
Yes true.  Although for a double-spend of a zero-conf transaction to be successful you need to race the network to propagate the fraudulent spend, so after 10 minutes your zero-conf transaction is safe against everything but a dedicated double-spend attack.
If your car is worth the millions of dollars it would take to make it worth doing a dedicated double-spend attack, then you can afford to wait for a confirmation or two.

When bitcoin crashed from $30 to $3 I lost interest in the bitcointalk forums.  Kept mining, but stopped buying because I couldn't get cash into gox and the other local exchanges closed up.
Came back to the forums 12 months later, when it had passed the previous ATH.
All of the conversations that were had in the initial run up from a dollar to $30 were being had again in the run up to $260.
And all the conversations that were being had post $30-&gt;$3 crash were being had again in the aftermath of the $260-&gt;$50 crash.
I found it quite amusing.
The same pattern was repeated in the $900-&gt;$600 crash, but nowhere near as strong because the time to recover the previous ATH was ridiculously quick (a week).

Yes, same issues withdrawing AUD.  Had a friend cancel his withdrawal after 4 months, and bought bitcoin instead (price had doubled since his withdrawal request).
If you just want to buy bitcoin, all the options (plus localbitcoins.com) are worth investigating.  
If you want to _trade_ bitcoins, mtgox is the only one I know of that has an AUD market you can trade realtime.
If you want to cash out, mtgox is your last resort.

Don't know about litecoin (I wouldn't bother personally) but you can buy bitcoins from localbicoins.com.  Or you can use coinjar.io.  Or you can register at mtgox. 
Once you've got bitcoins, you can buy litecoins at any exchange that sells them (eg. btc-e).

If you were to sell your car for bank transfer, you wouldn't let the buyer out of your site until the funds had reached your account 2 or 3 days later?!
If you were to sell your car for cash, you'd want an armed guard (or you have a really shitty car).
If you were to sell your car for cheque, you wouldn't let the buyer out of your sight without grabbing a copy of their drivers licence and/or passport and/or a utility bill.
Or you use bitcoin, wait 10 minutes for 1 confirmation while you go for a final test-drive, hand over the keys, explain where the spare tyre is, show him where you keep the service manual etc.

They could offer demand deposit with fractional reserve, they just need to be sure that the new deposits plus loan repayments are greater than the expected withdrawals for any given time. 
How sure they are will relate to the fraction chosen for the reserve. 100% = no loans of demand account funds. I'm not an actuary nor a banker so I can't say what a realistic number would be. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:49:23


That pretty well sums up that particular argument.
Also don't forget that there can be an unlimited number of Bitcoin clones.  So instead of paying with US pennies, you could pay with Canadian pennies, or UK pence, or Australian cents, or yen, or ....

Yes, that possibly could work, to merely re-establish a bitcoin position on the way down after causing a panic.
It still doesn't change the fact that a "real" crash (as opposed to the ordinary crashes that we have from time to time) could do irreparable damage to bitcoin, negating the value of those holdings.
There are a few things that help insulate bitcoin from this.  Firstly, we have multiple exchanges, with more coming on line.  This makes it harder (but far from impossible) to pull off.
And as bitcoin gets bigger and bigger, I expect we'll see a more solid floor under bitcoin prices.
And as bitcoin gains more traction, the downside risk of trying to pull off something like this increases - if the dump doesn't cause panic then the dumper has merely sold their coins to willing buyers, and bitcoin is stronger for it as the bitcoins are now more spread out. 
And there is a good chance that the majority of people that have held on from prices where accumulating tens of thousands of coins was doable for anyone but millionaires (sadly I'm not one of them) are people in it because they believe in the idea.  These people would be more likely to cash out and buy a roadster or a ticket to space than try to dump and pump.  IMO of course.
