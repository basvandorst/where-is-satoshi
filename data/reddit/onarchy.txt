I will gladly do that the moment the government stops taxing me. Until then I will get some of the tax money that was taken from me by force back through tax subsidized things.

Let me ask a relatively naive question here. It seems that everyone agrees that increasing the blocksize from 1 to 8 MB is peanuts, but that the issue of a bigger blocksize is propagation time due to the bandwidth bottleneck. Well, isn't reducing the block verification time from 10 minutes to 1.25 minutes (and reducing the difficulty by a factor of 8) the same in terms of propagation bandwidth as increasing the blocksize from 1 to 8 MB? It seems to me that we can achieve two things at once here, first increase the number of transactions (over a 10 minute period) as well as making bitcoin more "real time" in terms of verification. It will then only take 5 minutes to get 4 verifications.
Yes, difficulty is reduced by a factor of 8 but this also makes it easier for smaller pools to compete for blocks, and the security of bitcoin is already dramatically oversized already. So why not as a start do this, while we are waiting for solutions to the next step?

Thanks, yes, I suspected base latency plays a role. But that just slightly nudges the calculation. If you add in a 1.25 minute cushion time then you should avoid that, so make the confirmation time 2.5 minutes instead. so you could increase the block size to 2 MB and reduce the confirmation time by a factor of 4.

Thanks for clarifying.

But Spice Girls do not make music in order to listen to it and enjoy it. They do it to make money from being artists. If you counterfeit their songs and listen to them without paying them, you are most definitely depriving them of monetary value. The same of course is true if I counterfeit money. My copy of money actually does dilute the value of your money if I consume it. Counterfeiting is immoral and a violation, and is bad for everyone. This is true whether it is music or money that is being counterfeited.

Of course, but good/bad in a moral sense has nothing to do with market signals. All I have claimed in this thread is that it is impossible for the market to distinguish hoarding from losing money in the forest. They send the same signal to the market, which is to reduce activity.


Yes, that is indeed why investing requires knowledge and intelligence.
Hoarding isn't always pure waste but whenever there exists productive investment opportunities hoarding is usually highly suboptimal.

Again, very few people are using BTC at this time and it is not a big deal for the few vendors to change this, and it is not a big deal for the skilled users to adapt to this.

No, there are two very different kinds of savings. Hoarding is one of them, investing is the other. The big difference between the two is that hoarding brings money out of circulation, whereas investing maintains the money in circulation, even when you are saving.

But why lend your money to alcoholics and gamblers when you can lend your money to the most productive investors?
@_date: 2013-07-22 11:21:44
This I do agree to, but I was not reacting to this per se. Bitcoin is not money yet, and therefore hoarding it is sort of outside of monetary theory. However, it appeared to me that many of the people in this thread made a more general claim, that hoarding is not bad even with real money. The initial comment I reacted to was the claim that "hoarding was a Keynesian slur for saving." Well, Keynes was a monetary theorist and was talking about the hoarding of MONEY, which is what I then continued to comment on.

Actually this is not really that fast. in order to be able to produce 1 block every 2 hours you need to have 1/12 of the total mining power in the bitcoin network. At the moment the total mining power is around 60,000GH/s, which means that whoever is mining only has 5000 GH/s. That corresponds to about 3 minirigs, which are 1500 GH/s each. It could be that they have a few asics running like this, but it is quite puny compared to the total mining power of all the chips they have ordered.

The guy driving the getaway car in a robbery is just as complicit in the robbery as the people holding the guns.

You could say the same thing about money. Money can be infinitely replicated for free, and if I make I counterfeit money I have taken nothing from you. You still have your own money in your pocket. Or?
@_date: 2013-07-21 20:25:02
You are correct. You would be supporting all of them indirectly. In fact, you would indirectly be lending out your money indiscriminately to EVERYONE.

I find it profoundly ironic that a site dedicated to STEALING the intellectual property of other people and depriving them of their rightful income is seeking donations from their fellow pirates. Amazing, simply amazing.
@_date: 2013-07-21 20:30:16
On the contrary, it is precisely because some economic activity is better than others that it makes sense to invest in those particular activities that are more productive and profitable rather than investing in the whole economy indiscriminately.
@_date: 2013-07-21 12:29:09
It is true that as long as bitcoin is money, hoarding does not hurt the economy. But if and when bitcoin becomes real money, i.e. something that is used as a primary currency for nominating salaries, loans, contracts etc. then hoarding does hurt economic activity.
No-one is talking about forcing anyone to spend their money. Keynesian policies is not the only alternative to hoarding.
@_date: 2013-07-21 12:13:31
Suppose you have gold coins, and then you just hoard them under your bed, saving them for a rainy day. This has the same effect on the economy as if you lost your gold coins in the forest (and then rediscover them a few years later). It results in less economic activity.
Contrast this with what happens if you lend your gold coins to your neighbor for interest. Your neighbor will then spend the money, thereby maintaining the same level of economic activity. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 10:05:42
Ok, I take your unwillingness to try to explain how to distinguish a real market signal from a fake one as an admission that from the perspective of the market the two are in fact indistinguishable. When money disappears out of circulation you have no idea why. You can´t possibly know whether someone lost their money in the forest or if they are hoarding for a car or for their pensions. So it IS a signal, but it is so vague that it affects the entire economy equally, by signalling prices to fall IN GENERAL. Indeed when this happens the signal is called deflation. This is an extremely unprecise market signal.
Contrast this to the market signal that occurs if you instead of hoarding actually INVEST your money, e.g. by lending your money to your productive frugal neighbor. Then there is no fall in spending in the economy at large, but it is being shifted away from the things that you normally buy, and over to the things that your neighbor buys. Suppose your neighbor is starting an auto repair shop and he needs to customize his garage a bit for this purpose and borrows money from you to do it. Then money is taken away from your surplus, luxury item shopping, and spent on building capital (the repair shop). The neighbor spends the money on repair tools, on equipment to rebuild his garage etc. This signals to the people who make these things that there is demand for that kind of goods. No THAT is a sharpshooter market signal!
@_date: 2013-07-21 20:29:01


Correct! The ultimate abject effect is if everyone hoards ALL their money. Then you will have no economy at all.
@_date: 2013-07-23 15:14:31
There is a risk in hoarding too. You are taking the chance that your money will be worth something in the future.
@_date: 2013-07-21 21:04:03
This is only sustainable as long as Bitcoin is not money. Once it becomes money continued steep appreciation in value is not sustainable because it makes lending more or less impossible.
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:14:34
"there's absolutely no reason they should wait so long."
Yes, there is. While information is easy to move across the globe today, the same is not true of money. If MONEY TRANSFER were as easy as information transfer is today then there would be no reason why the legal distribution of music and movies could be as easy as the pirate bay. But thanks to the government's hold on money and the insanely complex and expensive laws and regulations for banking and money, micropayment for instance is impossible today.
Therefore it is profoundly ironic that many of the people who are strong adherents of bitcoin (which challenges the existing monetary system and promises to make it more efficient and productive) also are strong adherents of piracy of the victims of the bad monetary system today.

I don't understand why it would be a problem for a decentralized currency. If there is a majority among the miners to implement a revaluation/redenomination then this will happen in the next update.
At the moment there is no-one using bitcoins in the mainstream. Bitcoin is entirely used by really smart and educated early adopters. Doing a revaluation at this time (or when it reaches 1000 dollars) would not cause any chaos at all. And by the time bitcoin reaches 100,000 and is almost universally adopted all the newspapers will write about the big bitcoin update. People read news. It's not big deal.
"I can't imagine how you could possibly think Satoshi would be for a redenomination."
He publically said so in the bitcoinforum I believe. I don't have a reference though.

Hoarding has the same effect as lending your money out indiscriminately to all people in the economy, including gamblers and alcoholics. Why? Because when people hoard, demand falls and the businesses then have to reduce their prices. Reduced prices = increased purchasing power for everyone. So hoarding is equivalent to lending your money out to everyone.
If you instead INVEST your money, i.e. lend it out discriminately to the best and brightest people, then you the money will be spent more wisely and yield a greater economic growth to the benefit of all.

Apologies for replying in the same manner, but do you think that government is the most productive investor? If not, then why did you mention them?

Africa is currently home to the most developed mobile commerce industry, as well as the largest digital currency in the world, the mPesa. Needless to say, Africa is ready to take on Bitcoin, perhaps more so than any other continent in the world.

How does a hoarder signal that he has money that he plans to spend in the future? He can of course go down to the local car dealer that he plans to buy a car in two years, but this seems rather unlikely, don't you think? As far as I can tell, in most cases the ONLY signal that the market receives is whenever someone purchases something. In all those cases, hoarding is for the market indistinguishable from someone losing and finding money in the forest.

But the direct cost for consumers is that quality series are cancelled, and movies that are slightly outside the box are never made. Besides, a rape victim also survives and probably still make enough money to stay in business, but that does not justify rape. It is still a violation. Thus, it is not an argument against intellectual property that the makers are able to surive even despite the theft.
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:09:34
Great, now, can you tell me exactly how the market is able to distinguish between a hoarder who withdraws money from the market and someone who loses his money in the forest?
@_date: 2013-11-02 07:16:28
No, actually this is exactly what I am talking about:
"If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point.  Same amount of money, just different convention for where the ","'s and "."'s go.  e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00."
A revaluation/redenomination, just like I propose.
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:12:17
Sure, this is true to some extent, but this doesn't mean hoarding as such is good. If you can cut down on hoarding and increase investment then this is preferable and will benefit both you and society.
