There is coinmate.io for Czech rep.

We already have PoW :D And it isn't flaw, it's how it works.

Yes, I understand there may be bots that are checking common passphrases, but how they get the seed in first place. They need to know seed to try the passphrase on, otherwise they have to guess the seeds and this is not very effective. Unless you mean they are monitoring common seeds that are not randomly created, like poems or so.

That's correct, it's malicious fork which only survived because of an emergency difficulty adjustment they added. They basically crippled Bitcoin to be able to proclaim their truth.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:24:47
The address has BTC in it :D
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:25:38
Bitcoins slow difficulty change ensures that shorter chain will most probably die because of extremely slow block time, they got around this function by adding EDA and now they are claiming BCH is "the original satoshis vission" :D that's why is malicious, because if they had only increased blocksize, BCH wouldn't have probably existed.
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:37:25
You created you BITCOIN address AFTER the fork to have access to your BCASH... This doesn't sound right to me.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:23:28
This is really sad.
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:22:32
No offence, but start by reading something about mining. That will be a great start. EDIT: In case you don't want to read so much, I can guide you through the whole process. I only charge 3,000,000 satoshis per hour.

It doesn't really matter for how many thousands years, but it may exist until the end of our civilization. The next one may start with seashells, or shiny rocks. We are talking about durability in context of money, or store of value important to us in our time, maybe few generations in the future. We choose gold as money, but this may vanish in the future. So gold is very durable as metal, but do you really care what happens with your metal in 10,000 years? Also there is a change that Earth will be completely destroyed by some advanced weapon but bitcoin ledger will be safe in many copies in our spaceships or colonies :D
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:55:07
Also divide exactly few satoshis of gold would be probably quite expensive. So micro transactions with gold, even though are technically possible, are not convenient at all.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:38:51
Then just moon, there is no volatility on the moon...
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:42:51
Because level of divisibility of bitcoin is sufficient for now, this rating probably has to do with simplicity of division. (Few clicks vs. some tools, scale etc.)
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:38:28
But there is a little bit of atmosphere on the moon, so maybe...
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:17:49
True, still... why Electroneum? :D
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:18:55
Bitcoin should have A\+ durability as gold, yes you may lost the keys, but bitcoins will still be in the blockchain, as if you drop your gold to the deep sea, you will not able to use it, but it will continue to exist. I'm just wondering what is more anonymous though.

I fixed it for you.

This!!! and someone downvoted this guy *facepalm
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:20:11
I understand it's a bad idea, but I also think many people use a singe english word. I am tring to find out what passphrase will be secure and also memorable. So my question is, if I use for example two random english words, how much time would it take to crack it? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:42:04
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:47:18
No, he provided thiefs address, it was stolen and after less than half an hour transferred to other addresses. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:56:05
What to f\* are you talking about? Infrared / radio hacking? Stop spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:25:07
That is an interresting idea, you mean I should create a wallet, put some money in it and send the seed here on reddit without telling passphrase? But how should I know some bot will spend computing power on the wallet which may be empty?
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:48:42
No, but it's good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:45:22
Thanx, I suppose that three random english words should be fine then. If I count with 170000 english words, the result is over 15000 years/gpu.
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:16:28
Because we need bitcoin to be immutable.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:08:35
I just turn the spelling-check on :) Won't happen again with dictionary..
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:38:18
Yes. I used "immutable" because Andreas uses it that way in relation to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-23 13:28:57
So Bitcoin is BCE now? Nice try Roger:D
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:23:51
I assume you mean increasing block size by hard fork. We now have lightning network which is other scaling solution and also you can theoreticaly create sidechain or sidechains. You can also optimize how the network works with data or how users uses the network, we have segwit and batching. More optimizations, like Schnorr signature, is on its way :)

Are you somehow retarded?
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:15:05
Ok, say you are in Venezuela.
1. You have bitcoin
2. You need to buy food
3. Merchant only accepts Bolivars
4. So YOU are gong to sell YOUR bitcoins for Bolivars because you wanna eat.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:04:01
it was wrapped segwit address
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:16:40
Are you sure about that? Year ago, when I decided to stop using their wallet I moved my funds to the segwit wallet on Ledger without any problems.

No need for insults for a f* liar? Yes, there is need... You should stop poisoning this sub and get off. I hope karma gets you soon.
