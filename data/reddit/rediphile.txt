I bought mine just fine without a phone number.

Human rights defined by who? 
I largely agree, but I'm just asking for the sake of debate. Human rights are all made up by us after all. What one nation might see as a fundamental human right, say access to education or healthcare, another may not.

But these are the less-capitalist ones when compared with others. While yes, they are capitalist, these nations regulate that capitalism to a great degree in order to control the harmful aspect of it. 


Come on now, that's silly. I'm ok with capitalism, but not this appeal to tradition. Lots of evil shit has been the norms for thousands of years. Sexism and racism are the dominant social ideologies (especially historically) in the world too, but that doesn't legitimize them for me. If we are talking about human rights, appealing to tradition of dominance doesn't make any sense to me. 
As for the bootlicker comment, that was not made by me.

No, there is starvation and death in all economic systems and to pretend otherwise is stupid.

\&gt;What does that matter?
Many people in this thread are pretending raw, unregulated, capitalism is the ethical ideal. I strangely disagree. 
\&gt;Its not like capitalism was exported to the rest of the world.
in many cases, it very much was. Look at Chile for example. 
\&gt;i'll assume you implicitly agree with him unless you say otherwise
Why assume that? To be clear, I'll happily say otherwise. I don't feel people who support capitalism are bootlickers, I would reserve that term for supports of fascism personally.

That's the joke. The globalized capitalist world is obviously full of death and starvation.

No disagreements there.


Agree, it's an over simplification of owning private property for a profit. 


Agreed. The person I am replying to argues the opposite.

I thought true capitalism inevitably leads to one dominant company/monopoly which works specifically to prevent other companies from existing at all, which is why governments intervene and do not let 'true capitalism' happen.

Yes, thankfully in capitalism no one starves or dies.
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:24:41
They can, sure... But it's absurd to believe the ability to do so is identical.
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:51:56
No it doesn't have to be identical, I just get annoyed when people pretend it is.
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:36:16
Agreed, many attempts at alternative systems have failed miserably. Well at least mostly, [Cuba certainly doesn't not fit this]( I just hate people who pretend that capitalism is a ethically perfect economic system and make poor arguments to support it. 
I like bears (the animal) but I don't go around pretending they never ever attack people or that they create zero harm. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:37:34
Wot? The globalized socialist world? I don't think that's ever happened yet, although yes I suspect it would be full of starvation and death too.

Pretending social conditions have no effect on ability to succeed is absurd. I could perhaps agree capitalism is as good as it gets, but anyone who thinks a kid in a Mumbai slum has the same exact ability to succeed as someone born to a upperclass family in New York City is an idiot. That's fundamentally untrue, and a few outliers do not prove otherwise.

Marx agreed (sort of): "Marx divides the communist future into halves, a first stage generally referred to as the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and a second stage usually called "full communism." The historical boundaries of the first stage are set in the claim that: "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. There corresponds to this also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." - [Source](
This was also always the official position of the USSR/China/etc.
Basically all of the countries people call "communist" are not. They are in a state of "dictatorship of the proletariat" which is really really shitty, at least in my opinion.... and because of this no nation has ever reached what Marx termed "full communism".

The board game is specifically based on the economic system, although it's arguably more fair since the random chance involved between players is equal. In a real game of "Capitalism!", some players would need to start with large amounts of property/wealth from the get go. But that wouldn't be very fun to play now would it?
I need not appeal to the board game at all though, monopolies exist in reality too. De Beers for example. I simply used it as an example almost anyone can relate to. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:47:59
Have you legit never played a game of Monopoly in which there is a winner? 
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:53:01
If your economic argument rests on a 'too many logical errors there to bother refuting" refusal to make an argument at all, you might want to do a little more reading.
Seriously, just name one logical error. What can you possibly disagree with about my statement "monopolies exist in reality too"?

It's a common core worksheet, so likely many of teachers in that area are using it. This teacher did no create it themselves (which is fine and would be a waste of time anyway as many already exist).

Sounds dangerous. Isn't it flammable?
