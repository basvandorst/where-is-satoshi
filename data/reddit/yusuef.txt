I am posting this  thread on behalf of **ni23457** \- It was his funds that was stolen by  [changenow.io](
**What happened:** Illegal exchanger from Russia(the  activities of such services are not legal in Russia) hold my funds and  do all to delay the situation. They demand documents, selfie,  videoverification. But I am not obliged to disclose information about  myself to a group of persons who conduct illegal activities in its  country. It's just dangerous.
**Scammers Profile Link:** [
**Reference Link:** [
**Amount Scammed:** 100 BCH / 11 BTC / $70 000
**Payment Method:** BCH
**Proof of Payment:** Dear friends I don't want to  publish my wallet address. However, fraudsters do not deny the  problem(you can see this in next posts). But in any case, I can show my  wallet to any moderator.
**PM/Chat Logs:** Again, fraudsters do not deny the problem. Of course I have a long long dialogue through email, but it's too big.
**Additional Notes:** I advise you to not deal with this user until this dispute is resolved.
**INVESTIGATION TOPIC WITH THE INFO ABOUT SCAMMERS:**[**
More than two weeks ago I opened ChangeNOW.io and tried to exchange  100 BCH for 11 bitcoins.Why  did I come to this site with such a huge  amount? I confused them with  Changelly, which I once worked with. And  this was only part of the total  amount of exchange.After I sent BCH,  the exchange was suspended and  I was asked for a image of the passport  and an explanation of the  origin of the funds. I wrote my indignation  to them. But when a man with  a Russian name Sergey answered me, I  tensed. If this is a service from  Russia, then why should it establish  the identity of a person with such a  large volume of coins? What  purpose do they have in the time when the  transaction itself could not  cause any suspicion (other than volume)?  This is not for them to be  formally protected from regulators, since in  Russia it is not regulated  by anyone and they work illegally. I decided  that it was just a  formality. I took an image with someone's passport  from google-images  and sent them. And also I explained the origin of the  funds, although  there is nothing to explain, everything is already  visible:
**1. There is only one incoming transaction(a few months ago)  and one outgoing transaction(to ChangeNow.io) on the wallet.2.  The  origin of funds on this wallet is my another wallet. This wallet  was  created 5 years ago(before bitcoin hardfork) and it replenished only   once(5 years ago).3. The presence of many coins on my wallets indicates  that private keys were not stolen.**
But  after that they asked to send selfie with a passport. There was  no way  out and I had to make a real selfie with a real passport.They   accused me that I deceived them and now they will conduct an   investigation. That was 2 weeks ago. All the days during these weeks   they said that they are investigating this situation and can not say   about the completion time[ same thing was said to me when communicating by mail **within 2 weeks**.   Do you understand cynicism? Absolutely anonymous people, without a   company, addresses, telephone, working illegally, appropriated my funds   and in fact declare that they will return it only when they themselves   want it.
They said it until 2018-07-20. This is explained by the  fact that on  Thursday I told them that I found all the information about  them:  their names, phone numbers, office address. I said that the  information  about them will be published and then forwarded to the  competent  bodies of St. Petersburg, as they, having organized de facto  anonymous  exchange service of anonymous currencies (only I probably did  not have  the luck with my volume) brazenly violates the laws of the  Russian  Federation. After that they immediately wanted to communicate  with me  on video communication. And now they are blackmailing: "that's  when you  call us, then we will decide about your funds."
But I do  not like this approach. Persons who conduct completely  illegal  entrepreneurial activities in Russia, trying to steal funds  from those  who feed them, have no right to demand anything to me. I  will not please  them. I do not worry about my funds, I'll return it in  any case, it's  just that I will not leave anything from their  "business" and from their  personal reputation.
Please understand me correctly. I do not  gloat simply because they  work illegally in Russia. It's just a  convenient hook. But I would  never used it if they did not try to steal  my funds.You, having at  least six months from registering on the  forum, think: what 2 weeks  investigation can be carried out by a group  of people doing their  business illegally **in the time when the  blockchain shows that I  own the funds for 5 years, and the presence of  many coins on my  wallets says that private keys were not stolen**.  What  investigation? It's clear even for a fool, that this is a lie and  an  attempt to delay the time to the maximum in the hope that the person   will fall behind and the topic will be forgotten.
I repeat, I  have absolutely nothing against services that work in  the shadow of the  state. Not all states have perfect legislation. But  if you work  illegally and yet have no honor, trying to brazenly steal,  then do not  think that you will get away with it.
