As I understand it (source: I'm from Belgium), trading in **derivates** is forbidden. Buying bitcoins in themself is legal.
My opinion: meh. This is more to make sure banks do not sell things based on crypto. (E.g. buy this derivate, if bitcoin goes up, you'll get money and you do not need to have bitcoins)

Dash (that ubuntu logo in your left upper corner in the dock) -&gt; Search for "Startup applications" -&gt; Disable bitcoin there

You don't need to buy an entire coin. You can just as well invest $20 in it.

**TL,DR**: The solution is pretty obvious: when you request a full node some info -and you get it-, give the node some bitdust.
First of all, you do not need to change the core protocol, there is no need for a hard fork, to complicate bitcoin even further.
Second: a proof of bandwith can never be established. Whatever clever or complex system you derive, a sybil attack is easy to setup. Create three nodes, which send data in a carousel. No-one can verify that this data has actually be sent, except the three nodes working together.
Proof of service, however, is as easy as it can be. 'Proof that you gave blok 618 to someone, by giving it to me; I'll pay 600 bits'. Of course, the escrow problem will be here (you have to trust the client, he might not pay), but this can be solved by authentication and keeping a blacklist (so you get only scammed once).
There will be also free nodes and price differences between nodes, but the free market will play and an equilibrium will be established.

I meant to authenticate first, with a signed (by owners public key) message, not by IP.

The fact that it will be a revolution within computer sciences.

P2Pool just mined another block! The third of today
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:06:11
No, the blacklist is only local. How would you implement a sybil attack with it?
Edit: dust could be solved with a sidechain that is only converted to btc from time to time.
@_date: 2014-05-13 23:34:32
The specialized hardware can be circumvented by asking a different hashing each time, randomly chosen. (sha, double sha, bcrypt, etc...)
What do you mean with network radius? The propagation time of the entire network?
This can be circumvented by generalizing the blacklist to a 'trust'-list, so you know and trust (automatically) some nodes more, especially the ones that are longer in the network. This means that you can send the block ahead and expect to receive some dust.
This would, indeed, introduce some trust into the bitcoin network, but getting scammed once for some dust is acceptable (IMHO)

Some feedback for you:
I do like the icon, it looks slick and clean. However, as you've already read, it indeeds feels a bit [generic]( it could be used just as well for a [logistic company]( "chaining your logistics" or something.
It also doesn't represent the core idea of the blockchain quite well; I'd add some extra boxes of which it would appear that they'd 'fade into infinity', as if you'd be watching down from an immense pile of stacked boxes.
Furthermore, people won't embrace a logo for the blockchain. Why would they? There already is the bitcoin logo which everyone knows -even most noobs. It's a  bit the same with that Ƀ character. Furthermore, it's no use of confusing noobs with 'what is that blockchian thingy? What has it to do with bitcoin?"
However, there is a large opportunity to provide the logo for this new emerging concept of sidechains! If you'd tweak your design a bit to represent the sidechain-idea, that could work out great. A visual identity (through a logo) works even for a strongly technical thing. We have seen that with the [heartbleedbug]( So yes, this logo could have potential.
Last but not least: licensing! The logo is utterly useless for the community if they can't use it under a proper license. Most simple is [MIT]( or [GNU/GPL]( Read a bit about these, and publish your icon under those!
**TL;DR** Logo has potential after a bit of tweaking, eventually to represent the sidechainconcept. Also check the licenses!

I guess that checkbox is for windows? I don't know, honestly.

This can be solved with a small hashcash, on top of the sent dust.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:19:57
Yes, indeed. I kept my explanation short and simple, as not to frighten people here away from linux.

To update:
- Open a terminal. (
- Type:
    sudo apt-get update
- Your password will be asked (in the terminal), with the prompt "[sudo] password for alcoholislegal:"
- Type your password there. Don't worry, no '*' will show up. Your keyboard is working fine. Press enter when your password is typed.
- A whole bunch of lines will appear. This is ubuntu downloading the last info about all installed software.
- Now type:
    sudo apt-get upgrade

Yes! It's very easy and ~~has been routinely done against betting services which immediatly tell wether you lost or not~~ (edit: I thought satoshidice got finneyed once, but I can't find evidence of that). They are called "finney attacks".
Please hang on while I'm searching for a link.
Edit 1: Good stackexchange answer on the matter: 
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:59:13




Let us keep it gentle for the uniniated :p
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:25:59
Because everyone waits for one confirmation at least :p
Note that finney attacks can also be performed with a higher-fee doublespend:
I send you 1BTC with 0.001 fee. You say I lost the bet, and want to keep the coin. I spend the same 1BTC to myself, with 0.005 fee. The miners will favor the last transaction, duping you. If I won some bet, I'd let you keep the bitcoin of course :p

Yes and no
You can embed data in the blockchain, and some idiot posted links to websites, and a claim that these were links to child pornography.
However, it were just links, and these are in encrypted form, so don't worry to much.

Well, the previous posts that asked to vote, had comments as "Hey, I have to log in, I don't want an account". I'm countering that a bit.
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:06:29
I already sent out a ticket to the support, it seems me there is some trouble with the comma.
Normally, to write a half, '0.5' is used (DOT , or '.'). Dutch people use a comma: '0,5'.
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:51:04
I don't know actually. It's just that persons who don't want an account, wouldn't feel obligated to make one.

(Edit: it's free! Forgot to mention!)
You can just download it! It's about a gigabyte (800mega).
Then, you can (with a special program, see the instructions) but it on a memory stick or CD. Reboot your computer, enter the bios and startup from the disk. Then, ubuntu will start up (from the USB, and ask you to install it, including a window to set your partitions!)
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:10:17
More or less... In both images, I say I want to spend $100 (note: my balance was $0 on the moment, so the balance didn't matter).
However, on the English site, $0.5 fee was (correctly) withdrawn... not so in the Dutch part, where $97 would be withdrawn. Oops.

Tomorrow, the dropbox votebox will be open again for free users, I still have to wait 29 hours.
For people who don't know Dropbox: it is a cloud file storage service. If you don't have an account, don't bother making one.

Ubuntu is a great, user friendly linux platform with an easy installer! If you need help, don't hesitate to PM me. I'm a ubuntu-user myself too.
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:53:39
I know, I'm a computer scientist student. I'm also used to use a dot. They used a comma on the site, that must have messed up some scripts.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:35:19
And of other languages using commas...

Hey, I had the problem too... Best thing to do is to download and install bitcoin-qt again (BACKUP YOUR KEYS!)... (That worked for me)
Worst thing that can happen is that you have to rebuild the blockchain (thus downloading the blockchain again)
