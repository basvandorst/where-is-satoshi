It's 50€ dude chill the heck out
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:33:32
Just chill. Don't buy more for a few days or a week. Ride this out and figure out where it's going to land. Even if you lose 10% or 30%, it will be back up in a month.

I'm not american but the FBI took my btc lol.
It was held in escrow, if I was smarter I'd have kept it on my offline wallet but at the time it was only like $50 (and then $5000, and then $20 000, but literally a few days later the site and all the btc was seized) so I didn't really care, plus I was spending it so it made sense then.
They took all the btc held on sr wallets, 'legal' or not, so yes: you, me, and everyone else lost all the btc held on sr.
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:29:11
Not really accurate.
Bought btc at $1 for the first time.
Lost it all on sr when it got seized.
Lots of other people bought at whatever, $.0.30 or $5 or whatever and sold at $100 or sold after the first big crash. Or sold after 200% returns. Most early adopters didn't have the foresight to hold tons of btc to the thousands.

Ah, bitcoin atms. I just looked into it and my city does have one!
I will also look at Circle.


I didn't have to provide this much information when signing up for my *bank account*.

A perfectly working system with no one using it is still worthless, though.

Small local CU in my hometown in Canada. 1 Branch. I promise you have not heard of them.
@_date: 2016-03-18 20:55:45
...not really? A perfectly paved road to nowhere isn't useful. Even if bitcoin works as intended, if there's no one to work for, what's the point? It's just a bunch of numbers sitting around, unchanging.
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:13:51
No it doesn't. You can send a btc transaction with pen and paper
@_date: 2016-03-18 11:04:37
I'm just worried that these sites will either be hacked, or an employee will steal info, or the owners will go rogue etc with all my information. They require so much that it's an already pre-packaged identity-theft just sitting there.
Why can't there be an option to e-transfer funds or something?
@_date: 2016-03-18 11:02:30


and thus the transition between existing financial systems and new ones [bitcoin] is very rocky.
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:00:53
You trust it in the same way you trust a cheque or an old school credit card rubbing.
So it's not perfect. But the point is in situations like this, it will work in a pinch. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:24:24
Canada uses spaces, which IMO is the best.
1 000 000, etc. Because like I just typed, sometimes you want actual punctuation next to your numbers, and spaces don't confuse you. If you need to write a series of numbers, you can use commas, ie: 1 000, 2 000, 3 000. That's a lot less confusing than 1,000, 2,000, 3,000. Though really both are good.
Periods are fucked though. Those are for decimals you dirty animals.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:10:24
Man this is a great comment.
I was in an incredibly similar situation to you at that age, at that time. 
I spent about $1000 at the time in btc on the silk road haha. Kinda sad I blew what could have been a few million on some drugs but at the time no one knew, and it was fun.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:22:11
He mined around 5-10 million us dollars (at today's prices) worth back in the day, sold most of them for about $20 000 at the time, now has a few left over that are worth $75 000
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:11:28
But also shows that he sold what could have been many many millions of dollars for a couple thousand.
Still I think this is a fantastic surprise haha.

You're right, of course. But unfortunately this subreddit is full of get rich quick libertarian Mongoloids who jerk off to pictures of Ron Paul.
Take everything people say in this subreddit with a bucket of salt.

Oh great. A bunch of fucking libertarians chose bitcoin.
This is literally the least confident about bitcoin I could possibly be.

It's the meaningless *comparison* that we are talking about.
No one is arguing that these are both important stats, meaningful in their own right. They just have fuck all reason to be compared in this specific and pointless way.

Yep. The risk/reward is so heavily sqewed to reward that it makes mathematic sense to risk it. 
Also, op says network of 100k, which isn't enough for a house anywhere, just part of a mortgage.

You know what I want? No one to make money. Can btc just sit somewhere? Can it be stable and can we actually use it to buy and sell stuff? Greed has created a currency worse than fiat and that was never the plan.

Well don't upload your content to garbage hosts that have 0 sharability or any functionality whatsoever and people won't need to freeboot.

Another mt gox could potentially crash btc 100% and have most miners move to a different crypto, though the market at this point is I think is too estabished and too smart for that to happen again, most people don't have all their crypto in one place.

I'm saying that your current net worth doesn't affect your credit history

I would take that bet in a second. Not that hard to build up from nothing. Do I keep my job, credit history/score, etc? Yeah I'd go 10:1 on a coin flip with everything I've got. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:02:07
Can't pay rent in btc yet. Can't buy groceries with btc yet.
As soon as I can, I will. Until then I'll hodl, and others will sell to pay for stuff. It makes sense currently, hopefully, more retailers will accept btc and more infrastructure gets implemented to make payments easier and faster.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:56:40
I could go and donate my entire bank account to charity and keep my credit score.

That being said if you can't afford to lose everything, which is just as like, get out.

Bought my first bitcoins at $1. Do I win?

I'm assuming you're not Ellen's demographic.
Your generation invented the Internet and invented computers (as we know them), I think that most younger people can appreciate that but are also jaded because in reality you are the anomaly, most 60+ people got through most of their lives without using a computer and are very tech illiterate. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:40:16
It's still an easy way to conceptualize how much money that is.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:47:08
Sorry I might not have phrased that well, I'm saying that an exchange failing won't kill btc (might lose value though). There isn't a single exchange which has a big enough market share to kill btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:40:28

I'll have you know I absolutely do not. Had them deposited on SR when the lovely American government decided they wanted to have them. 
Should have used an offline wallet, or any wallet for that matter. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:43:51
Yeah seriously. I'm not sure how people can trade quickly with btc, it takes me like 30 hrs to do anything with the exchange I use

If he's not super invested in bitcoins I'd sell like 1 and send him on a really nice vacation somewhere.

price is stabilizing at 2400
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:07:14
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:42:16
Not worth to sell in a few days. Hold for a year and make 10x Roi, hold for 10 years and prices could be in the tens of millions.  
Btc is probably going to crash soon. No spike this big won't result in one. But no one knows if the price goes 2500 -&gt; 15000 then crashes to 9000, or if it crashes tomorrow to 1000, or if it goes to 100000 and crashes to 85000.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:46:25
If it's a serious serious amount and you're planning on just leaving it, don't actually use paper. Can etch into metal, acrylic, glass, etc and will be mega durable and still really cheap to do.

Up $150 in the past 10 minutes. 
As someone looking to buy I was hoping the price would fall a bit more but it looks like we're back on track for the moon.

~~Why do you hope? This can literally only be bad for bitcoin, especially these days when the spotlight is on bitcoin for the massive recent gains.~~

When btc hits 20k I hope you'll be able to buy a Tesla without using fiat. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:28:46
Not really. bouncing back shows it's still strong, but the strongest of all would be slow, steady climbing.
We want bitcoin to be a currency, not an investment or a casino. You don't want your currency fluctuating much. Imagine bread if $4 one day and $12 the next day and $0.15 the next. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:35:25
10m seems a bit high for 2027 unless something drastic happens to other currencies. 
Over 1m is a safe bet though. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:18:51
Fuck no one knows at this point. It seems to be stabilizing (averaging more like) around 2400 but there's still dips and rises of like 100 usd. I'm waiting to buy a bit as well and it's really hard to tell. 
If you're planning on hodling then there's really no 'bad' time to buy, but you can maximize profits if you pick a good time.
it's still very early in asia, I'm waiting until they all wake up to see what'll happen.
About 30 min ago would have been a good time I think.
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:43:49
If you're making decent money just get incorporated. It's nice to have an actual company for other reasons as well. IE if you get sued (or declare bankruptcy) as a sole proprietor then your personal assets are in danger. You can also avoid a bit of self-employment tax by forming an LLC and paying yourself a wage.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:36:31
Meh. Wish I had just bought more. I've believed in btc as a currency before SR existed and will never sell btc. I will spend it, and at the time that was one of the few options and a much safer and more reliable way of getting drugs anyway. And I had fun. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:39:07
It's not super common to have CC underage, but I've had one since 16.
I can't believe no debit cards though. That's crazy. Can you even get a bank account?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:59:18
I'm waiting to buy, but the price is already heading back up. I think that dip was smaller than we were all expecting. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:02:47
I bought btc before I was 18 with PayPal. Though back then it was a muuuuuch less serious thing, so that might be harder today.

If there's a global currency collapse or recession 2008 style and btc rides it out, people see the value in that price will be in the hundreds of thousands if not tens of millions, if that happens.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:28:49
Bought a few hundred btc in highschool for ¢ents and mined a few for fun. 
Bought a drug with what would be &gt;$1m. 
Had a few left over (12). 
Forgot about them until they were worth $1-200ish each (maybe a bit more) bought a bunch of drug. 
Had like 2 left on my SR account when dpr got arrested and lost em. 
If only I knew to hodl.     
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:58:20
This is good I think. Just kill it right away and we can go back to btc at full value. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 05:09:04
Yeah same. When I was 18 I bought what could have been $200000 worth of SR things.  
Still I got 12x more from my initial investment so I'm sorta ok with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:01:35

I'll buy at sub 50¢. Spend like $50 and see what happens. Probably nothing. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:11:50
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:38:28
I agree. I bought my first btcs at 30¢. I'm in it for the long haul. But the difference in hours today has been literally hundreds of dollars. 
I'm not worried about dips, always HODL, just looking to gain as much as possible where I can. personally I see btc as a currency not as an investment anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:29:55
