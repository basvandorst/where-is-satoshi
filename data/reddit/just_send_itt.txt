Exactly, and now that we have livestreaming on top of that, we can have full accountability. Crypto is going to burn all the paper gold on the market.

But what if I fork it? Isn't it only money if we say it's money? What if I agree that another coin is money? Doesn't that have a similar effect to inflation? And wouldn't I want a coin to have some intrinsic demand for a service or resource? Blockchain will definitely increase accountability and bring peace, but it won't be because Bitcoin only has 21million coins. It will be because we can have accountable corporations, democracies, and gold vaults with decentralized control over them.

I've been in the space for 8 years. Bitcoin has been usurped from the people that actually understand freedom and power. You're missing the point of blockchain if you don't see how a fully transparent ledger and large server farms leads to a power differential. That's why you need privacy coins for use as immutable ledgers. Everything else is for eliminating power and providing transparency. Bitcoin, in every one of these respects, is extremely inefficient for what it's failing to do. Gold is secure in its value, and blockchain provides transparency. For everyday purchases, this is ideal. For DACs that eliminate power, look elsewhere. For issues of freedom, if you want immutable blockchains that can't be seen or touched, look to the privacy coins. Bitcoin and BCH are the same, and the community has been sabotaged. Why don't you look at who pays for development?

Having an immutable blockchain is for privacy coins, otherwise the government's just going to come after anyone who isn't a cypherpunk hacker who thinks they can get away with it. They can still put you in prison. And, there are better coins out there. I see it like a company. Why would I use something as expensive, wasteful, and slow as Bitcoin? There are coins that do 100k transactions a second, don't waste electricity, and have way more specialized features.. I'm just going to use those.. On top of that if I want something stable with value that can't be innovated away, I'm going to buy a livestreamed gold-backed blockchain. Transparency solves the gold standard's previous problems.

Bitcoin is easily regulated. People will only find out when it's too late. Bilderberg has been in control of it for a while now. Sad and people don't want to hear it.

Is the Bitcoin community really cheering for censorship? Is this real? You have all lost sight of the principles, or are new and don't understand the purpose of cryptocurrency. I don't even like BCH.

Bitcoin is an open source project - whichever fork is the "real bitcoin" is subjective. This proves to me how ignorant and divorced from the principles the Bitcoin community has become. The Foundation destroyed this project.

We still have legal tender gold from the Treasury. If you livestream the vault and put it on a blockchain none of those things are a problem anymore

Me every time

Are you serious? Just because I have a different point of view than you doesn't mean I'm a liar. What did I say that was misinformation? You are proving to me how interested you are in money, and not the conversation about technology. I deleted my account a while back because I had to focus on school and I decided to make a new one recently. If you can't refute anything I said, what does that say about your motive?
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:03:34
This is great news for crypto! I bet they'll skew the algorithms to put the worst coins at the top though. Classic Facebook move.
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:41:15
Yeah, this is the most ridiculous statement anyone has made about crypto lmao. We're not even going to have mining pretty soon. Mainstream bringing up 5-year old debates.

I don't think you understand what a smart contract is... The very definition is that it's trustless.. And Bitcoin is public, and therefore traceable. I'd rather have an anoncoin, or a smart contract coin that has additional features for replacing fiat. Why would I buy a coin without demand built in?
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:11:05
Dude... come on stop equating it to an oracle. SOME smart contracts use an oracle. That's like saying ALL cars are blue. It's not correct. And what does bitcoin have to do with any of that? We fight by making products that actually work to make us freer and richer - not by having blind faith in a brand name.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:14:34
Who says you need a centralized oracle? Like I said you don't know what a smart contract is. That is a type of smart contract. Why is Bitcoin a store of value? Brand name? Not a lot backing that. I'd rather have a use case that systematically reduces the supply as demand increases. As for privacy, there aren't any right now that 100% solve it, but there are experiments like Dash, Monero, Zcash, and Zencash, which, among others, are all doing cool things. When the next recession/depression comes around, people want coins that aren't traceable. Look at Venezuela - they are buying things off the black market all the time just to survive. If the government can't see it, and can't seize it, it becomes a store of value in trying times. Bitcoin can be traced and therefore regulated. What's the point?
