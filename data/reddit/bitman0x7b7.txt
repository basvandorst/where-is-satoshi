Help to get my BCH from a Blockchain.info (pre HD) wallet into electron cash (bounty 0.225 BCH) 
Hey guys, I’ve been trying for a few days following info I’ve gather in the internets but I think I’ve hit a roadblock. If anyone can help me regain these BCH I’m offering a bounty of 0.225 BCH.
This is the situation: I had a few bitcoins left in a blockchain.info wallet. Those coins were sitting in “imported addresses” since I had them there since before blockchain.info change the wallets to HD and never swept these into the main HD wallet. I realised this after the fork, so I proceeded to move the bitcoins into my Trezor after the fork.
Then I retrieved the private key of these addresses from Blockchain.info in order to import these private keys into electron cash. Problem is when I tried to import the keys into electron cash, it said that there were no coins, and most shockingly, the address that it was added to electron was a different address (not the original address containing the BTC/BCH at the fork).
I tried to do the same in a coinomi wallet with the same result, different address, no BCH.
The original address from blockchain info wallet is the following: 1DieZGFGp7ViSLvmeWgML1yfriSJcTtbxD
You can see in this link that this address still has 0.45… BCH 
But in electron cash the address that is imported with the private key from blockchain.info is the following, 1Fz7mz67iFiE5iokWCKx1Zt6JLreExtLFF which appears empty 
Thanks for your advise.

Thank you for your reply, the issue was solved in this thread, 
Blockchain.info was giving the private key compressed instead of the private key (not compressed), solved it using bitaddress.org. Thanks!
