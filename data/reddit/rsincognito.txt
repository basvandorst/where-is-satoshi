Dude I would love to send you some coin, but I’m afraid that if I did the U.S. would say something like I was funding terrorism or something like that.  As f*cked up as that sounds it’s the truth.  :(

The day I saw “crypto” as a navigational tab at the top of goldprice.org was the day I was like “if crypto is posted on the main website for the worlds gold prices it has to be legit.”    And that was the day I bought my first little hit of crypto ,

After reading Coinbase’s insurance policy just now, it seems like you are very protected against a hack and operation failure of the company and employees. After the whole ledger software issue with people loosing access to their funds I’m torn in the middle on where to keep my coins.

KuCoin will work,  they ask for kyc only if you are trying to withdrawl more then 2 Btc a day,  it’s dreading platform is allot like binance.

Wells Fargo can suck it, they are my most hated bank on the planet,  I have personally never banked with them but I used to be in automotive finance and I would have customers all the time come into me and say we tried to get loan through our bank well Fargo and they wouldn’t approve us, THEN I would end up getting the customers financed through Wells Fargo through my dealership and they would ask how that happened, I would then tell them Wells Fargo doesn’t give a shit about you and they only bought this deal through my dealership because we do so many deals with them,  there is no loyalty in banking anymore.  And that’s why I love bitcoin .  F the banks ! :)

@_date: 2019-08-13 23:41:43
Just buy it and hold, there is no need to overthink, beating yourself up over a couple hundred dollars for the buy in means nothing when Btc goes over $100k one day
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:54:46
Perfect condition, I’m sure once they opened they where like “this is beautiful ! What the fuck is it?”  Lol

Coinbase pro or just Coinbase ?

Pretty sure these don’t have seeds.  Unless you were making a joke. Lol

At what point would you be responsible to pay taxes or traced in the process of doing it that way ?

Yes cashing out coin would be dumb also , I’m talking about to cash in 500k worth of gold at one time ,   You can easily sell 20 oz a gold a week around town with no problem at a couple different locations and fly under the radar.
@_date: 2019-08-31 18:32:05
Kucoin for sure ,  don’t use any of the other ones
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:20:54

It is a cold wallet made by an artist, you can google his website, his name is Max.  He has been creating these for a few years now. It is supposed to represent a type of functional art , the public key is displayed on one side of the art so you can load it .  The private key is only accessible by breaking the glass and destroying the art to get to the private key under the hologram so you can release the Btc to another wallet.  It’s a physical store of value, a quality design with beautiful detail and it makes a great conversation piece,  I have been collecting them for years now .

That would be the stupidest thing in the world to do. Why not wait till it hits $24k and take out a $12k loan against your btc on nexo.io as collateral and never sell and leave your bitcoin in the market? (Your welcome)
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:11:47
I have never been anywhere and sold gold jewelry and been taxed for selling it.
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:39:27
 Bitcoin is 95% of my financial savings wealth. The other 5% is made up of gold and a couple stocks.  
I am my own bank, capable of using nexo.io to take out loans and borrow whatever I want against my crypto store of value.   Every family should have 1 bitcoin per family members, in doing so everyone who has one will be their own bank 5 years from now .
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:24:57
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:27:07
I’m in the USA, so your saying taking a loan while staying in the market avoiding 30% capital gains tax is a bad idea ? Maybe you should purchase a calculator.

Just sell your bitcoin directly for gold ounces on a handful of metal websites . Bullionexchange is one of them.  You can buy up to $9k a day. Then take the gold to a pawn shop or metal buyer and sell off the gold ,  super simple
@_date: 2019-08-24 05:06:34
It’s a big deal. Physically bitcoin settlements, bakkt will need a very large supply of Btc to keep things flowing. Between bakkt , cashapp and Coinbase the market is about to see a supply problem when the halving comes around  next May.    
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:16:32

Well he did ghost us. Lol. Just kinda creepy , I’m a major fan of crypto for years , but I have wondered sometimes . Is the mark of the beast going to be a btc address put on us ? Or some sort of micro chip that works with crypto wallets.  Just a stoner thought I guess.  Lol
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:23:55
No it means you are 1 in a million being there are only 21 million coins made. To be in the 21 club you need 21 full bitcoins in your ownership.

I will do both,  whenever I get caught making a big unneeded/luxury  purchase I make my self buy exactly as much bitcoin as the purchase price of my item , if I can’t afford both I buy the Btc instead , has worked great for years ,  especially right before last Christmas !!   Lol.
