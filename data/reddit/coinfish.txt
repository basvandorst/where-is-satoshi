* If i don't use it , do i loose it? 
ok. always wanted to say that. 
IF i wanted to hire a good coin dev. what kind of requirements am i looking to put in the add? 
I.E : Looking for an engineer with strong Computer Science background. strong working experience with C++, C and additional other languages. Familiar with blockchain and cryptocurrency.
Is something like this a good add? Will it attract a Soft Engnr that will be well experienced in crypto? 
Basically what kind of requirement should there be listed to hire some one like Gavin and not some one who thinks he can apply because he fork Bitcoin once?
cheers!

Thanks for the reply. I guess I am trying to find out if there are any skilled devs that could pull such a move flawlessly. (ignoring the consequence of the market. Let's assume everyone single one is up for it and ready to fork. %100 all of bitcoin services and holders will agree to fork)
Just trying to see if it can be done technically. I always wondered. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:38:45
Just looking for technical possibilities. Can it be done and not mess with the whole transaction history in the past? It is easy to say yes but some good devs have told me it will be extremely difficult to do if not impossible with out breaking the code. 
I am not looking for possibilities of what this could mean if it's done successfully. I am looking of it can be done. With Bitcoin. Not making a copy and forming it as an alternative coin. The same Bitcoin. 
Could it be done flawlessly?

Can bitcoin do a reverse slip? Is it possible to do it straight from the code and hard fork it? 
Like go back to 2.2 million total coins. If you had 10 btcs now you will have 1 once you update
Can this be done flawlessly or will it mess with all the previous transactions history? 
At the same process in reverse. 1:10 split? If you have 1 btc in your wallet after the fork you'd have 10 btxs?
Looking for a solution that the users all they have to do is download a new wallet and synch up. Non of that create a new coin and exchange it!! :) 
Edit: to clarify. I am looking if it is possible to do and if there is anyone comfortable to do it. Ignoring the rest. Assuming everyone is on par and awaiting the new download. Not focusing how will people react. Just want to know of it is doable? Some good devs have told me that it would be a nightmare and maybe impossible to do without breaking the code. They said they would not touch that project with 100 ft pole. They said it would take an extremely skilled dev that knows the ins and outs of the whole code. Even that person would not be able to pull it. 
So the question is then why not? Isn't every code able to be reversed engineered? There has to be few people who are skilled enough to pull this off flawlessly, correct?

Again. Ignoring or assuming full support. I am not asking if it will get the support. I am asking if anyone can pull it of. Ignoring the realistic i possibilities that majority will not want it. Assuming it will have the full support of the same network %100. 
Coming down to the code only. Can it be done. Is there people out there who could?

i am not making any mistakes and if i did they will be mines to make. 
everyone one nowadays seems to have their own opinion about how should be moderated. which is fine with me as long as we all can have the same treat and be allowed to talk equally. 
Having options is healthy and is the only way forward. my cry here is that a lot of people spend a lot of their personal time to create and grow this sub reddit and now we are given no options to discuss. 
i would go else where but here is where the majority is. so for now i have to sit here and try and quickly read some great peoples opinions about new bitcoin features before they get deleted to oblivion. 
i want the option to choose who to believe.

okay ill bite again..
if it is the longest chain, then it also means it has the highest hashrate wich also means it has most of the miners on board. 
the miner wont be on board out of empathy. they would be on board because they will know that there will be a demand of users to buy the newly minted coins. This would also suggest that most of the users, or at least the $$ would be on that chain. Because miners follow the $$ first. 
by your definition, the longest chain is the accepted one. and thus to think that the minority will be able to reject it is wrong. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:49:46
wat. that is excatly what bitcoin offers. longest chain is the main chain.. not sure if you understand that..
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:15:22
agreed. 
altcoin is thrown so freely out here.. 
how can it be considered an altcoin if it share the genesis block.. mind boggling 
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:37:22
if i recall. the "core" team kind of agreed they will not defer from their road map. making it obvious any one else opinion would be pointless
this made it obvious for everyone else that wanted to offer their own opinion and seems like they chose to not open a BIP knowingly it would fall to def ears. 
Now that some one's proposal is getting tractions, your main point is that they did not go through the proper channels? 
i don't blame them. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:47:14
blah.. so tiring to read this.. yeah like everyone who doesn't wants to see more changes then an escrow service as an offer to improve scaling and voicing their opinion or voicing by upvoting must be rooting for XT. 
like its so hard to imagine people get excited to see more options being offered..
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:26:04
what a im trying to point out is that when people use the longest chain they usually mean in the thousands blocks.. not 1-6. 
that is why you got the "wat" from me.
now i understand you mean short blocks "longest chain" welp, that is irrelevant to this discussion.
what was proposed , it would take at minimum 750 block out of 1000 blocks.. and that it is just to kick off. it still has to stay in lead for many more before it is considered the longest..
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:12:34
wat... 
i mean i kinda understand what your trying to point out but what does it have to do with anything? 
so all this time you were talking about 1 block fork... 
also miners are restricted to behave or else all their burned energy will go waste. The scenario you are describing is a speculation. good luck with that.
