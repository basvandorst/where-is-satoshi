Gah, use full when at a bitcoin store buying a video game. It's embarrassing. They should have £10 in hot storage atleast.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:55:08
Yeah I know "you don't own your private keys, it's not yours." 
I wanted to buy an Google play app with bitcoin tries onebit. It wouldn't go through, it took £1 for some reason (ontop of the card price) now they have spent my money. Great.

We will never know, they could be being sold now, and this is the advert.
@_date: 2017-04-11 23:05:25
Also tell him we want UK support
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:35:58
Does it work in the UK?
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:33:49
Burn Bitmain. We must stop them this is a whole new level of unnaceptable.
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:33:21
US banks. What about UK banks?

Do you have an ETA for Canada and UK support.

I might as well get my parents to go to a bitcoin ATM then. (I live near birmingham

LocalBitcoins is easy. Just click Bank Transfer or another online payment method, open a chat with the buyer (They usually want you to verify your id with LocalBitcoins) and send the money.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:33:53
Yeah, but why not have it pay then you walk off, the receipt has an ID QR which can say if they have received payment on there end.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:43:12
If it was printed on the receipt I wouldn't see an issue.
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:46:26
*cough* *cough*
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:51:27
Yes, make sure they have a high rating first, and have verified there ID in there profile.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:42:40
Sounds like good advice*
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:12:18
I'm not the best person to ask since I use bittylicious (a UK service like localbitcoins but with less P2P contact).
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:51:10
Yup, people giving their private keys not their public.

Yes, however developers that develop on the ethereum platform will need to move over, which will take time and money.

Do I smell *sniff sniff* vaporware?
I think this is a good idea, its not open enough, and there is no "Work ID", " Online ID", "Personal ID", " School ID" kinda feature, people want to keep everything separate.
 I don't want the bank knowing they got a detention at school and have an account on cutekittensmokeweed.com and I work at XM360 and got a strike last week for eating a pizza. That would be awkward.

Probably due to the fork tommorow, miners are shuffling around.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:00:30
Yep any app that supports using a seed to recover the wallet.
