I read analogy its like putting a one year old in a jungle all by himself.  Chances that he makes it is very slim, but if he does he will become a force to be reckoned with

There will be custodians for these tokens for the masses soon enough.
\--edit.  I get the whole not your keys not your Bitcoin.  But masses wanting to put these tokens in their retirement plan, and ones that are not technical will want this.   It is what it is.

I like it means bottom is almost in.

i started to talk about it in early 2017.  No one cared until the bull run later in the year...at which point I got all sorts of people approaching me to tell them more about it and which alts I liked.  Moral of the story is most people don' care until it starts going up exponentially again.

At that point it would probably be known more as buying satoshis.

Longer term people are going to inquire about putting Bitcoin in their retirement plans.  That is Fidelity's bread and butter.  Good strategy on their part.

Yeah.  But if a huge custodian got in to the game, I would consider them.  Kind of like storing your gold in a bank safe deposit box rather than a safe in your home.  Both have their ups and downs.

assuming client would need to tranfer crypto to them and they would store.  Article didn't say anything about them trading in crypto.  Assuming less regulatory hurdles for this, but not my area of expertise.

Yes agree Ammous more too.  I like Adreas, but I don't think he go this one right -- The free market  will  select the best store of value.  One will win because of network effects.   All functions of all alt coins can be built on layers of bitcoin.

well put.  thanks for the good explanation  (this needs to be further up in the thread)
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:09:38
If you believe it then it's true

desktop (software wallet)  better than exchange.
I prefer hardware wallet like trezor or nano which offers a bit more security.

Why necessary to generate new seed and  not just add passphrase and transfer any coins to the passphrase protected wallet?

uggg.  This sub is too doom and gloom for everything except crypto.  Some stocks in your retirement fund are a good hedge against inflation.  So is real estate and commodities.  Diversify folks.

nice choices
