Bisq is definitely one of most important projects into Bitcoin universe today. From privacy/p2p perspective, it is far better than local bitcoin website. The issue with them is the UX. The usability and interface are just horrible. I'm sure if they invest some effort on that, they could increase the range.

Nice post, thanks dude!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:59:22
congratulations buddy, I'm really happy for you!
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:35:02
Better than AdcCash? Low fees?
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:10:40
Magnr, Offer Swap in Bitfinex, reserve other coins at Uphold  and BOT at BTCC.
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:40:38
Correct! I'm italian living in Brazil and feel the same!

Dude I like this project very much. Maybe Xapo BTC card or Coinkite Card is similar. Waiting for news.
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:30:19
Amazing! Viva bitcoin y Latinoamerica!
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:53:10
Yeah, you're right at this point.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:07:26
agree, come back score now!
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:59:44
I recomend Bitwala. Coinbase is like a bank to me, they sux.
@_date: 2015-12-06 05:25:55
Wow, good initiative :)
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:17:09
Bisq need improve user experience. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:48:36
I'm living in London. I bought here using Uphold and Solidi. I agree about your concern. Everything here is harder, burocractic. I used to live in Brazil, buy bitcoin is just fine. In UK, it is hard request to open a bank accout.
@_date: 2018-06-19 11:50:47
I love Bisq concept but unfortunately UX is so bad...
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:37:11
He is trying to help but he just should be be quite, then work hard and HODL 
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:32:39
Unfortunately talk about adoption now is not possible because fee is too high.
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:20:06
Indeed. To be fair, Tether is a huge cancer since the beginning.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:08:19
I really like Copay, its great UX and you can disable BACH on Settings if you prefer. It's so good and Dash Dev team is doing a implementation using same code and concept. To be honest, I agree with BitPay and Coinbase when they complained about fees in the past. I agree with part of positions and plans of BitPay.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:09:15
amazing, I read this and buy more straight away
@_date: 2015-11-13 13:41:03
Man maybe I red and speak english very bad... but this guy from TV project the BTC price to 600 USD after 9-15 months, is this?
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:08:19
Hei mate, for investiments check the Magnr website. You can invest BTC and get rate of 2.18%. Other alternative is convert BTC in USD at Bitfinex and Offer Swap. You have mixer. Never put all eggs in the same pot :)
@_date: 2015-11-08 12:35:23
Try Uphold, Circle or Localbitcoins. If you from South America, I recomend FoxBit exchange or Ripio from Argentina. Never use PayPal or something like this... no chargeback.
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:04:05
Coinkite had best API of bitcoin wallets :)

I'm italian, living in Brazil and plannning move to Bristol (UK) in 2016. Dude whats the best exchange in UK? I know Kraken and Uphold to buy. And I don't like Coinbase support and guidelines.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:58:57
I loved it. We need follow that russian guy now.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:31:18
People from USA are so rude. They are not americans, because we in South America are americans too. We spell "estadunidense" for people from USA. Viva Brasil.
@_date: 2015-11-13 14:40:22
Guys, I'm italian living in Brazil and moving to Bristol (UK) in 2016. I need a little help of us. I need 2 debit cards, one is Xapo because it keep balance in BTC and I can spend with GPB currency. Now I need a second card to deposit BTC and auto-convert to GPB, like ADVCash does with Dollar USD or Euro. Do you know a solution like ADVCash? The E-coin Card is a good alternative?
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:44:28
Man, this looks so nice.
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:18:18
They can clamp down company exchanges like Kraken, Uphold, Bitwala and others. Maybe p2p market can be criminalized too. I'm italian livin in Brazil and moving to Bristol (UK) in 2016, worried because my plan is use bitcoin to transfer my coins.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:53:23
amazing doc!
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:54:57
In Brazil we know a case from a student which buy Bitcoins from Coinbase and send to Foxbit (exchange of Brazil) to make some profit with arbitrage price. When volume increase, Coinbase just closed account. And didn't say any arguments. So now we recomend not buy or sell, put the dolar in another place. Unfortunately the UX and price of Coinbase is so good, but now we buy bitcoins from others companys.
@_date: 2015-11-25 08:02:07
very good!
@_date: 2015-11-27 11:36:28
I'm a huge fan of Bitwala. They have good price and UX :) Saludos from Brazil :)
@_date: 2015-10-21 18:31:05
Yeah, I like LocalBitcoins very much. Long live p2p market :)
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:44:17
I'm a huge fan of Uphold. They had a nice UX. Waiting in Brazil for AirTM and link do bank account. They should create a Debit card system like BitGold, Xapo or AdvCash. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:38:16
Localbitcoins maybe has best price... but BTC and PayPal don't match because the engine of chargeback.
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:42:23
Hi 0a0d0s0. You can acess the website exchangewar.info and put "paypal" in the search field. So you can select the exchanges who work with Paypal :)
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:33:00
Very nice engine and solution! I'll release this website in Facebook Gamers group from Facebook in Brazil, because CS continues with a sucess and huge popularity. Cheers!
