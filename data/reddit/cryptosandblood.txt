Its true, however, if you DYOR and truly invest in tech, you should be no more worried today than you were a few weeks / months back . This isnt the first crash I have sat through

No that describes a peer to peer system dumb dumb. It says nothing about decentralization. You can have peer to peer with full centralization, clearly.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:42:05
Exactly, even a moron would have handed down to someone else. Trash? Comeon. It had horsepower to handle mining and btc txs obviously at the minimum, it wasnt trash.

Why is there an investigation into an unregulated market?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:54:27
Aol and netscape were not the most simple and free version of their counterparts

Wow you can buy extremely select tickets at a large fee whoopty doo
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:30:34
Oh fuck you and your mightier than thou bullshit, maybe you were lucky this time, but all of this crypto is built on lies and duechabaggery, you can and will fail all the same in the end. Especially with the bullshit i just read, wow, get over yourself you poor fool
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:34:30
The circle you make back to fiat and specie being a poor value center is pretty great 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:05:07
I see your point however this fails to address these facts.
-1 the value center of bitcoin resides within its functionality no different than paper money.  Paper money is BIG business. It costs billions to create specie and fiat. The real work and real equipment it takes to make coins and to support the network that runs the ledger. That stems to real industries like power, real mining, etc
-2 bitcoin may not be the “best tech” but it is the most simple and unbreakable with the longest legs that evades control of any government. 
-3 bitcoins value started in the crypto community and populous 3rd world countries where its a real tool for them , a tool of necessity

Certainly there are much easier and cheaper ways to kill a person than to waste a 100k$ machine, car accidents dont guarantee death anyway stoney, if the person inside is not wearing their seatbealt they can survive by getting thrown out / around inside the car
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:32:22
But why? You have no foundation for any of that, btc market is now split into several coins, and you have no idea whats going on
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:08:33
Constantly disconnecting its fucking bullshit
 garbage ass website handling billions of dollars?! FUCK YOU!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:21:26
You can have it. You cant spend it and it costs alot to move it around. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:09:19
The average user will never understand the tech, your point is moot
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:34:10
Most ico’s are just a direct copy paste of bitcoin code , what’s wrong with that? Bitcoin is well known, functionally it is no better than any other they all have strengths and weaknesses. Bitcoin has plenty of weaknesses
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:32:16
Unless he is just lying? Can the wallet be verified?
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:32:49
Yep, gold has to be physically stolen, bitcoin can be stolen by some hacker teen or someone in a 3rd world country with literally nothing else to do

In your experience? Have you experienced a BTC hostile hard fork before this?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:42:25
Why would amazon sell dollars? Have you seen the charts? The USD has been going down steadily for decades and BTC has been going up steadily for almost decade. 
When will people understand that the dollar is dying and it’s time to get out
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:05:00
2017 the truth is pretty much the opposite of what the media says
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:25:21
99% of all cryptocurrencies have no purpose or even future, other than making certain people more Bitcoin of course*
