When no one in the world holds any dollars/pound/yen that they can use to buy some. 
Then it's the world's currency, de facto.  
Of course, on the way up that mountain, every seller has to have a buyer, and the Bitcoin seller ends up with some fiat currency. The fiat money doesn't just vanish. But the wish to hold fiat drops until it's worth only the value of the paper that it's printed on.  
So Bitcoin (or a faster future competitor) doesn't stop rising until the fiat bubble has totally burst.

Fair point. At least badly-paid workers can *try* to negotiate a salary increase every single month (without, admittedly, much chance of such).
Pensioners don't have that option.

That's because tulip bulbs have little intrinsic value. Their bubble was purely extrinsic.  
Bitcoin is in an even worse position: Not only does it have a negative intrinsic value (-$50 to sell) - but it costs an enormous amount of time and energy to mint.

Because while it doesn't matter to anyone spending their entire, increased, paycheck the same day, it matters a lot to people living on their savings.
Yes, I get that savers can *try* to find a savings account that pays interest at least equivalent to inflation. But that's just a workaround to a problem - not the same thing as saying there's no problem.
Their cash in a same-day-accessible current account (of which almost none pay interest in the UK) is gradually losing its value at the rate of inflation.
A true 'store of value' is one that you could hypothetically lock away in a safe at home and know it's going to buy the same number of loaves of bread/lambos/whatever in ten years time.  
Bank notes are no longer that store of value.

That wasn't a comment on the morals of HODLers - it was a comment on the mistakes of central bankers.  
Certainly most HODLers are seeing an easy win with recent publicity. Join them if you like, if you agree that the long term utility of Bitcoin is much much higher than the current price defines - and you don't have a better utility for your savings. 
 
If you don't agree with that premise (and if so you're in agreement with the thousands of people with sell orders of "&lt;CurrentPrice&gt;+$1") then don't buy it. It's that simple. The main thing the free market gives you personally is, indeed, that freedom of choice.  The best thing it gives everyone *else* is a price-discovery mechanism - it reveals the price a buyer and seller have agreed today.   
Right now the world is deciding the correct price for Bitcoin. Maybe its too high. Maybe its too low.  
Some of us who got into it a long while ago believe in cryptocurrencies *for their own sake anyway* - *as well as* being greedy HODLers.
So what do I care about hoarders. If they want to hoard, they can hoard. So what? What matters to me *financially* in this market is whether the price is lower than the future utility of a Bitcoin I could buy or sell today.
You're quite right about the speed of mining slowing down, so supply cannot increase. And we both know that demand will increase, at least until the price stabilises at some (insanely?) percentage of global wealth. But it will stabilise eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:49:05
I think we're not so far apart, and you make some good points.
I suspect the difference is that I didn't make clear that I agree that Bitcoin *is* currently a useless form of money - while it's still increasing in value so much. Everyone (us HODLers anyway) is indeed doing the equivalent of hiding it under the mattress. But that's only because it's at the same stage as automobiles were when men were required to walk in front of them carrying a red flag. It's still in its infancy. But in only a very few years its value will stabilise (at, we HODLers hope, a $1m, obvs.), and people will then be able to safely buy pizzas with it again.
I think that where we still differ is: that you view inflation (well, at least a *little* inflation) as a Good Thing, so that the currency keeps up with an expanding GDP and encourages trade.  
I'm not really seeing that inflation as a necessity for encouraging trade and think its disadvantages for savers outweigh it as central banks run up the printing presses. Bitcoins limit of 21m is what gives people confidence in holding the currency.
Other altcoins with dubious origins and potential hidden pre-mined quantities retained by their creators will never give that confidence.   
If gold coins could be teleported around the world instantly, I'm sure the economy could run just fine using only gold coins as payment, even with a fixed amount of gold.  
If worldwide trust in it stabilises (and I concede its a big 'if') I can see Bitcoin (or one of its alts) becoming the 'teleportable gold coin'.

It only causes a crash because a lot of people had weak hands - and had already codified that they wanted to sell if Bitcoin ever dropped to 9000. More fool them.

You're not really paying the ($1,000,000-$125,000) difference for more expensive bricks and shingles. You're paying for the cost of the land. It's the cost of the little piece of paper - the planning permission - that's gone through the roof.
Technology means that we're getting better at making *things*. But no one's* making much *land*.

You've got it back to front. 
It's women's fault.
Seriously, it is. And I'm saying that as a feminist. House prices started to shoot up once women (rightly) started to go out to work. But once they worked, a couple could afford to pay more for a house, and the free market made  sure house prices rose to that expectation. And now we're all trapped in that new reality so it needs two incomes.

Lots of good points. Not entirely convinced by Gold analogy though, because I think its most-recent spike (centered around 2012) was more a comment about lack of trust in world fiat currencies at the time than anyone really wanting to have to hide a kruggerand in their basement.
We don't have to 'trust' a gold coin. It just sits there, shining up at the owner. It willl still be doing that in 10 years as long as it's not stolen. But it's not a lot of use just sitting there, and it's hard to transport. The only reason the average person (outside commercial jewellers and industrialists) suddenly decides it's worth the awkward purchase process is because they suddenly don't trust the fiat paper in their pocket.
We can still have growth with a stable currency. What's needed is liquidity, and that will come when people are willing to lend their crypto to growing companies with good prospects. This is already starting to happen with Initial Coin Offerings which require payment in crypto. There are brand new companies offering benefits to their customers which wouldn't even have got off the drawing-board without Ethereum. I invested in a new one last week.  
(Of course it remains to be seen whether they run off with everyone's money, including mine, but that's the nature of risk taking capitalism.)

Oh sod off. Your ad-hominem comment isn't how logic works. Person A puts up an argument, with some evidence. Person B dismantles the evidence  or puts up better evidence of their own. Come back with either and we can talk.
There was of course a tongue-in-cheek element to my original posting - there are loads of reasons why house prices have risen in the UK. Fast-rising population versus little house building of course. Tighter and tighter planning permission. More expensive environmental regulations. Tax breaks removed from buy-to-let landlords. We could both find loads more.
But I'll stick to my original argument that women going to work was a big part of why. Now tell us why it *wasn't*.

While I hate fiat curencies and inflation, I'm not sure that's true.  
Poor people have the least savings and are more likely to spend all their paycheck on payday. So inflation is irrelevant to them.
The people that inflation most hurts are pensioners, living on their savings.

It doesn't. Problem solving is composed of more than just solutions. Problem solving includes attempting to find the original causes of a problem, so to better understand it.  
I love that you, like a couple of other commentators here, really hate to have to admit the world is not black and white but has shades of grey.
If I'd written 'hospital beds are blocked by old people with no safe home to go' I'm now confident that I'd get a commentator attacking me for having suggested that we machine-gun the crusties out in the hostpital yard.

Governments issued people bills of exchange for gold or silver.
Governments abandoned the people when they stopped cashing in, for gold or silver, the bills it had already issued to them, leaving them with just pieces of paper.  
That's fine - and stays fine - only until confidence in that government drops. From that moment it's everyone for themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:57:42


I hadn't heard that - fascinating - thank you. 
It's a specific example of 'bad money pushes out good' that I had heard the general case of before. It though may actually be an example of evidence of what I believe - that the moment the government starts to inflate the currency by issuing fiat brass coins, people lose confidence in the government-issued (brass, fiat) currency and start to hold on to the real stuff. That's the law of unintended consequences - that the central bankers do something that is good for *themselves* - and in doing so wrecks the economy for the rest of us.
I fully agree about the deflation that's coming - I'm holding crypto because I believe it's the future anyway *but also because** because I'm a greedy bugger who thinks there's an easy win on its way to a $1m per coin, and that rise will, if it happens at all, be stratospheric, with no one selling *any* until they've acheived their 'personally-required-retirement-wealth-level'.  While that rise is happening, it's going to be useless as currency.
I should really put up a 'Remind Me' so that we can talk about this when the dust has settled in 10 or 20 years and Bitcoin has either 1. is the world's currency used by everyone, or 2. has been usurped by an AltCoin with better utility, or 3. been totally forgotten along with all other cryptos
I've enjoyed our talk.

Oh Jeesh - mine wasn't a comment on the rights or wrongs of anything. It was a comment on Cause And Effect. Changes in society have consequences.  It's just how markets work. It's actually equivalent to saying stuff like: "If energy prices go up, the relative price of old, hard-to-insulate houses goes down."  
You appear to have a 'them and us' view, with 'them' being the horrid capitalist 'market'. But a market is just a meeting place for people (all of us) to come together and negotiate a consensual price for an exchange. The sellers of houses are the owners of the houses - your mums, dads, uncles, aunts, neighbours. They're not some Evil Corporation or Secret Cabal. Every time a house is sold the owners look for the best price they can get, and in years with lots of willing buyers the price they can get is higher.
I wasn't blaming women for wanting equality of opportunity - of course that's what's wanted.   
It's been a change that has taken humanity most of its history up to now to start to correct.   
You've managed to twist a comment that was in support of women's equality into support of rape culture. 
You *really* need to check your sensitivity settings.

Inflation is _caused_ by an increase in the money supply. No increase in money supply = no increase in prices.

Granted, paper currency is very convenient.


It may have been just a poor choice of words, but I can't help reading your last two paragraphs as arguing against each other. The market number of dollars has increased - but their value hasn't. It takes more of them to buy a loaf of bread now.  


This is back to front. People demand more of them in their paycheck _because_ the government has devalued them by freely printing and issuing more without a gold reserve to back up their stated value 'on demand'. 
Which, as you say, doesn't matter if you spend all your paycheck on payday.
But for the retired (or anyone else living on their savings) it's a slow and insidious fraud as it's gradually eaten away by inflation. Certainly paper currency is no store of value. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:11:06
Depends if you know the difference between 'money' and 'currency'.
Gold coins are money -they have value. So did silver dollar bills when they used to be redeemable for silver dollars. But that time has long since passed. Between the 1930s and Nixon's final hammer blow in the 70s a trick was played on the public by gradually reducing the true value of US bank notes, and now they're just 'currency', which, like Santa and the Tooth Fairy, are just a story told to children. Everyone agrees to go along with the secret because the truth would hurt too much.
Yes, there's an underlying value behind gold and silver. But there's no gold and silver hiding behind your bank notes - they're just paper currency and have no intrinsic value beyond wood pulp.
They've *decreased in tradeable value* by an average of 2% per year since 1870.
