Happy cakeday! Is Bitcoin mining affordable anymore for someone who doesn't own too much money to invest in miners?

Oh, fuck off, you xenophobic piece of shit! I've been doing freelance work for years and haven't had any complain so far. And like me there are many other honest Romanian freelancers.

You can not tip me, but rather donate to Alzheimer's association instead. Thanks.

What's the difference between yours and  ChangeTip? Why won't your tipping service fail?
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:45:38
Trump won t win though.

Woah! That's generous!

As a Romanian, I'm sorry for this. There are terrible people everywhere, but so far, there is no proof that his guy may be Romanian. Not all of us are thieves, however, the society tends to remember only the bad things. :(

IT WORKED! Thank you!

I've just withdrawn money from changetip to paypal. Worked like a charm.

I too have started this journey. However, for the moment, I have just 0,006 BTC. 
From what I understand, the more people will get involved and will own bitcoins, the greater the value will be. Am I correct?
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:10:10
thank you. 100 bits @_date: 2015-02-03 16:16:20
You definitely want to become the world's greatest tipper, don't you?
@_date: 2015-02-08 16:49:20
Can anyone ELI5 what does this mean, please? I am still a noob.
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:29:37
I wonder if you tip Khan Academy...would anyone collect the tip?
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:26:23
So, why is this important?
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:26:54
Can I have some too, please?
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:36:03
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:14:42
So tipping, eh? Hah! Think fast! 200 bits @_date: 2015-02-04 14:10:24
I'm trying to find a way to not work extremely much, but rather find a balance between work and education. Since I'm planning to study Medicine, I'm talking about a 6 year period in which I can not work too much. This is why I need to find a solution.
