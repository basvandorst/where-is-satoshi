Well I have done one wit 7 sat/byte.. it got confirmed in 45 minutes... And cost me less than a pence...

I took out my origjnal investment before the dip. The rest is win win. If goes to zero it is an opportunity to pump back up and buy at a discount. If stops at any point buy again...

Any semi professional exchange engineer whould have expected this... I never know if Coinbase ppl are incompetent or malicious...
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:44:19
Litecoin would make more sense...

They are operating a fucking crypto exchange... Define as a business anything more extreme, risky and volatile and cutting edge? They should at least have the option... This causes increased fees for them and their users not adopting segwit just doesn't make any fucking business sense...ohh wait they havent even given their users their Bcash... Maybe coinbase just gets off by screwing the customerbase...
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:09:48
The sub went salty because coinbase mqnipulated the market before releasing BCH to their customers...

You can't transfer oil through the internet... There is no way to convert whatever physical assets you can buy for it in Venezuela to sell somewhere else due to embargo... This would only make sense if you could by Oil coal and diamond for this crypto anywhere in the world... Which would mean replacing the USD... That is not yet going to happen...

I appeased the wife showing her the increment in the value of my portfolio of 5 cryptos in the past 3 months. And also told her that I have not spent a single penny for the last 3 months.

You will only need to hold, until BTC becomes an asset which can be accepted as collateral against a loan. Once that happens you don't even have to worry about it losing value as you will be able to get Fiat money against it.

He made a name for himself by talking about the burst of the 2008 property bubble long before anyone built a model for it and about the structural mess the EU was due to the unbalance in fiscal policy among the states.

Are you guys by any chance from North America? I hear banking there is horrid.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:19:38
Due to the volatility of the instrument as long as the fluctuation is bigger than the the exchange fee in a given direction, consistent bumps can be achieved on the return. 
This means you need a larger increase/decrease in price than +/-  2xTransaction fee and sell / buy immediately once these conditions are met). What is required is consistency to sell immediately once an opportunity presents itself.
This strategy is usually used in a wavering market where the price fluctuates in a band. 
This is a basic principle that most long/short trading bots rely on in the largest currency exchanges.
Not hard to see how this can achieve greater return than simple holding.

They have been around since the beginning of nineties and serve both consumers and businesses. Give them a check. They have done recovery from burnt/magnetised HDD'S, SSD'S etc.
Reasonably priced as well. You have a very good chance that all they need to do is to replace some of the soldered controllerchips on the ssd and the memory array can be read again.

Bought at $2.7K couple of days ago sold at $3.175K waiting to adjust down again to $2.8K to buy again and add more fiat into it (also not big buyer I only have like $200 in it and cant afford more than that/month). Has to even out the increases to maximise returns:). 
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:39:21
It only depends on the strategy utilised. Holding and buying is a long term strategy, but if you don't have the capital to just invest and hold, it is a feasible strategy to be an active investor and sell high/ rebuy on dips. The returns are marginally higher although in this case it is the exchange that makes the most money. So just invest into an exhange;)
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:13:58
Sure. Still better than liquidating the coins
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:07:20
I hope it lasts until end of month. So I can buy in when my pay comes:)
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:56:29
Yes. 
Effectively you could access your investment assets current value without liquidating it therefore losing its future value.
This way you would only diminish the future value with the interest payable on the fiat money and not jeopardize the return on BTC.
Banks currently offer cash loans against equity/Bond collateral as well. (Of course it would be a discounted price)

BTC and crypto will be safe haven for institutional diversified funds. (will take over from Gold)

1 million per coin would assume that the crypto market is roughly worth 300 trillion dollars... (300 billion *10*10) which is not realistic assumption if you think about the m0-m4 in the world...

You are asking the wrong question... How much any fiat will be worth once cryptos become the norm/mainstream
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:53:06
You need to buy bitcoin and also someone need to sell bitcoin for you to be able to use it.
It is just so volatile that using it does not make much sense at the moment as the price you end up paying might not be the value exchange you expect.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:40:51
This is offset by ppl keeping their coins diversified across multiple wallets.

I think the intrinsic Value is the amount invested in maintaining the underlying blockchain network. I get it, that Asics are not holding too much Value long term, but the electricity spent to operate them and labour costs do add up as added value in an economic model...
On a crash it is in the miners best interest to keep the punch bowl full and the band playing... Just like it was the interest of the fed in 2007/8...

When does the fork go live?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:20:33
I would never do it at all time high. I will wait for the next dip. Because it will dip when the segwit2x guys cash out.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:45:44
Well I know that my next investment is going to be in ETH. Just need to find the timing. Atm I am 50\50 (as cash invested at the time of purchasing) in Ltc\BTC. I think LTc is undervalued cause of the rally in BTC.  So I will pump equal money into ETH at the end of the month to make a 3/3/4 diversification. They might not all grow at the same pace but balance each other out.. and no I dont have thousands invested. I have the same amount of BTC as the OP. And I have no chrystal ball on what will happen.. but probably the same as with the last fork but faster...

I think in his last video it was funny how he explained why did he design spaceships (Falcon 1x especially) He did not have the money to hire someone good to do it for him.
Elon in business is like a poker player who goes all in a lot of the times even if he has shitty cards. He done quite a few moonshots where he ran almost out of money.

You can always move to a country where the tax laws are laxer... And moving bitcoin across borders is easy...

Is it Cheaper than the tx fee on Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:49:37
It is based on coinbase data.. So only one exchange... There is quite a bit of arbitrage opportunity to move between exchanges.
