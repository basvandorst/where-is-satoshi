That link doesn't work for me, but the concept is interesting. Lowers risk a little for the seller, but also increases risk for the buyer- an unscrupulous seller could send the usb stick, then send the btc to a different wallet just after the stick was delivered. Makes it a case of one's word versus another's. If the buyer chargebacks, the seller has proof of delivery of the physical item.

You misunderstand the way a trendline works. The further you get into the future, the harder it is to predict the movement. That bearish trend I posted 2 hours ago was correct, the price fell to 15 shortly after. The fact that it didn't stay below 15 has no bearing on my analysis.

As a student of economics, there's not really anything unnatural about it. Low volume lends itself to volatility. What would you consider a more natural price motion?
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:34:08
The main reason is that it takes time for the btc to transfer fully between exchanges, and the slippage risk is high. That said, a common technique is to have funds and btc on both exchanges, and when an arbitrage opportunity occurs, sell on the higher exchange an amount of btc equal to an amount you buy on the lower one.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:04:07
I believe it will. Still scary.

There was a delay with LocalTill's account that people speculated was because of LocalTill getting too many large payments, and triggering an investigation last week, but it got resolved within a couple days. 
I think you'll be fine as long as you stay in the 4 figures. 10k triggers some reporting rules for LocalTill's account, but I don't think you would need to show ID for that, anyway. (Might delay your payment going through, though.)

Update: The lower resistance is being tested, this makes the new lines parallel, which reduces the bullishness (chances it will increase out of 119) but increases potential delta. (how far it will go once it breaks either 115 or 119)
The longer we oscillate between those levels, the greater the delta becomes.

The moment a capital asset is converted into cash, regardless of where that cash is located, the taxable event has occurred. So yes, Alex owes gains on the $9500.
Here's the fun part. (DISCLAIMER, I AM NOT A TAX PROFESSIONAL) Bitcoin was identified as a currency by the IRS. People who trade cash directly for foreign currency and then back are forex cash traders. Forex traders get a very special loophole. It's called the 60/40 rule, and involves filing under section 1246 of the IRC. You will have to elect into this by opting out of Section 988, which is not hard to do. 
The 60/40 rule means that your capital gains for the year, regardless of how long you held your btc position, are taxed 60% at the long-term capital gains rate, and 40% at the short-term rate. Let's illustrate with a stock trader.
Bob, single, trades stock for a living. He buys and sells many different positions of different securities during the year. Because he doesn't own any position for more than a year, all of his capital gains are taxed at the short-term rate, which is the same as whatever your regular income tax bracket is. So, say he makes 100,000 in capital gains. This puts him in the 28% tax bracket, and all of his 100,000 is taxed at this rate, giving him a liability of 28,000, letting him take home a decent 72k.
Mike, single, trades bitcoin. He doesn't hold anything for more than a year, and ends the year with 100,000 in gains. He filed the right kind of return to take advantage of the 60/40 rule, and so owes ((60,000*.15)+(40,000*.28)), or 20,200, saving 6,800 over Bob.

Bubbles are a natural symptom of just about every popular tradeable thing. Apple stock is down over $300 a share since last fall. There was no fundamental justification for it to trade at 700 like it did. 
I'm a student of investing and technical analysis, by no means a seasoned trader, but a dead cat bounce is usually much quicker than the 3 day uptrend we're seeing. I believe the bounce was on the 12th when we went to $125 after hitting the mid 60s on the 11th. If I'm right, capitulation was flirting with 50 on the 15th. The return to the mean is probably being exaggerated right now by excitement at crossing $100 again, but the slower gains of the past 3 days lend themselves to more stability. I would be happy to see it rise slowly over the next few days, taking its time. The sharper the price increases, the sharper it'll fall.

I like how the writer says private currency always ends in tears, and lists 5 examples, only one of which has ended. Cigarettes in prison camps, Gold, Silver, and Bank notes are all still around, and not going away anytime soon. 
Also, the article they link to about the failed baby-sitting co-op clearly explains that the co-op failed when they started issuing new currency to combat the reluctance of people to use theirs. That can't happen with bitcoin.

I'm not biased in the least. I do believe bitcoin will still be around in 5 years, yes. But I'm not trading on that basis, I'm trading on the basis of the daily volatility.

I don't think there's a technical cause other than probably not much new money coming in at present. Bitfloor's story is pretty damn chilling to a new investor.
Edit- Actually, the fact that 100 is such a psychologically significant number may well have something to do with it. Look at the last 30 days:  
The two lowest periods of volume are the 2 days before it broke 100, and the 2 days before it broke 150. If it breaks 100, I'd expect to see a short run before the smarter people who bought below since the crash take their profits.

@_date: 2013-04-17 15:40:53
It matters in that time frame. It's been a week, and the crash doesn't tell me anything about what's going to happen in the next 10 minutes. I wasn't suggesting it isn't significant, but it doesn't lend itself to any price guidance unless we get to the highs or lows reached there. The only thing I take from it for short-term TA is the volatility and the volume precedents.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:29:01
I have no idea where we'll be in 12 hours. As I posted when the low support was tested, the lines are now parallel and horizontal, making the direction of the breakout harder to predict.

@_date: 2013-04-21 06:52:33
I don't think coloring works for bitcoin. It's a 24/7 force, and if you recorded the candle as midnight-to-midnight EST, it wouldn't be red. Not very bearish beyond the fact that we're in a downtrend right now.
Edit: and I just realized you did, and are trying to suggest that because 3 low volume hours into the day, we're slightly down, it's a very bearish trend. Sure.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:49:22
That may take more time. Have to fight off the rest of the sellers we'll find in the next few hours. So far so good.
Speaking of technicals: look at the 24 hour chart. 95 was a significant number, too, and it had a similar reaction to being crossed. Still trending up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:09:12
Honestly? If you're going to try to steal from others, I'm not going to lose any sleep if you lose your (probably stolen) bitcoin.

It depends on what you mean by bitcoin. If you mean a physical coin, it wouldn't be too difficult to get one sent up with spacex or some other commercial flight program. 
Not sure how you'd define a bitcoin transaction going to space, maybe someone going to the space station will do that someday.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:54:08
I know a lot of people don't like to talk Technicals or hear us traders discuss price, but the recent dip established a reversal from the uptrend that saw us break 100 yesterday, and I wanted to point it out. 
Now, bitcoin is volatile as nitroglycerin, but this indicates that the short-term odds of it continuing to fall are greater than the odds of it breaking resistance and rising.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:21:32
They'd be more likely to know than us.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:59:22
Delta is the term for a rate of change. Larger delta means bigger gains or losses. Delta is moderate during a range, because the price tends to oscillate between the support and resistance levels.
This part is more a personally held opinion rather than a taught aspect of TA. The longer a currency trades within a range, the more impatient swing traders watching it become, and it is my belief that the longer it takes to breakout, the sharper the breakout can be. It's less technical and more psychological.
The trendlines going parallel removes the bullish slant and psychologically increases volatility in a trader's mind. Instead of having a good idea one way or the other when and which direction the breakout will occur, now it's up in the air, which makes it harder to draw a conclusion.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:11:56

It's been flirting with 95-100 all morning, if it breaks the psychologically significant point of 100, I could see it jumping another 10-20% before drawing back.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:43:51
While I hope you're right, resistance is going to be stronger all the way up than it was when every jump was an all time high. I'd be happy to see it have a slow ride up with bumps here and there until we reached $250 sometime in the fall. We'll see.
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:18:37

@_date: 2013-04-20 05:06:29
You're confused. Strength when referring to currency is a measure of change in the exchange rate, it's not arbitrarily expected that 1 us dollar should equal 1 euro should equal 1 yen. 
When more USD are needed to obtain BTC, the BTC is considered stronger against the dollar.

A horizontal resistance and ascending support trendline is indicative of a break through the resistance in the near term. If 19 is broken, expect a breakout.

If the branch is in a decently suburban/urban area, it's also plausible that he was just curious because you weren't the first person to make a deposit to that account.

If you're serious about getting out, do it slowly. This most recent drop is not the result of a market consensus, it's the doing of a group of aggressive traders capitalizing on Mt. Gox's inability to handle its newfound popularity. I would sell in 10% increments daily, and I'd bet you a bitcoin that on the 10th day, you wouldn't be able to find someone selling a btc for below $250 to save your life. 
Think about taking out some, enough to diversify your holdings. If you have the ability to, invest some into lower risk investment products. But please don't quit bitcoin altogether. It's what they /want/ you to do.

I disagree. You're right of course, cryptocurrencies are growing, but nothing is remotely close to replacing bitcoin. It's not what I'd call a "commonly accepted transactional currency" yet, but it's way ahead of anything else. I can pay my rent in bitcoin. I can buy my pizza in bitcoin. I can buy gold and other precious metals in bitcoin. 
Bitcoin will be threatened by another, newer crypto someday in the future, I'm sure. But none of the other players on the scene today are even a year away from reaching the kind of awareness and advocacy of bitcoin.

Thanks! 
I think reaching 130 was insane, but that we may well see an increase as adoption continues. Seems like there's a new business every other day accepting btc, and mtgox, while far from ideal, has improved considerably in the last 2 weeks. 
Bitcoin trends with volatility one way or another. I'm ok with rapid growth like last night if it's followed by a drawdown and moderate growth like today. 2 steps forward and one step back is an ok way to grow. If we go back to 4, 5, 6 days of double digit growth, then I'll be concerned again.

Are you sure it was your bank and not Mtgox? You could try opening a support ticket with them. If it was your bank, then with only that much yen, I'd just wait for a dip and buy, then either get gox to switch you to usd or pull those bitcoins out and sell them on bitfloor/localbitcoins or somewhere to get usd.

For short-term outlooks, I watch the 12h chart, and require a trend to continue for 3 hours before labeling it. For long-term, I watch the 7 day, and look for a 48 hour consistent trend before labeling that. long-term, we're still under a bull trend. This may just be a partial pullback.

Saying "It's just a matter of time" in the same thread as "we need to convince this man" is a bit misguided.

The manipulation worked, but the end result is reversion to the mean- look at the buy-side walls on bitfloor right now. Supply and Demand will push the price up again. If anything, this crash helped, as it pushed a lot of supply out while people panic-sold to the less risk-averse crowd.

Looking at the 3 day chart, this isn't anything like a bubble. If we start seeing 20% gains daily again, then yes, but this is just a major confidence builder, and hopefully a reversion to the mean.

While some of those currency pairs are attractive (USD/JPN? You could bet down on that for the next 6 months.), I worry about a lack of information. For example, I have no idea where they're getting their btc/usd price. It looks like they might be averaging a number of exchanges together, but without confirmation, there's no way I'm touching that.

I'm not an old hand at this by any means- and I'm still down considerably from my initial investment, which was unfortunately over $200 each- but I'll try.
Panic-any emotion, really- is the biggest threat to me as a trader. It's easy to get worked up about watching bitcoin fall or rise, but in the end I have to remove emotion from the equation and just watch the charts. I don't care what a 0.01 or 0.05 trade price was, I watch for the double digit volume moves. 
At the same time, I have to be aware that most of the other people watching bitcoin aren't as in control of their emotions, and when HFT pushes the price in one direction or another, they amplify that movement, at least for a short time.
One other thing I don't do anymore is trade at night. It's tempting, since I'm relaxed and comfortable in bed, but it's not when my mind is sharp. I trade in the mornings now, and I try not to hold btc in my trading account overnight, or at any time I leave the computer. That's what my savings are for.
Another couple important rules I follow are not to be greedy, and know your fees. On being greedy- if a trade is currently profitable, the only thing you can do to keep it that way is to exit. The longer you hold it, the more likely someone's going to come along with 50 btc to sell and drop you into the red. Once I've turned a profit, I'm ready to sell.
Gox charges .6% on each trade. So for a single In and Out, I have to sell at a level high enough to offset the fee. For every $1 increase, the fee goes up a whopping 6/10th of a cent, so I generally don't bother to average my fees out, I just know I'm breaking even if I hit a 1.3% increase. 
I chat with some stock market daytraders during the day, and the biggest rule according to them (and according to Warren Buffet, considered the best investor alive), is don't lose money. If I've lost a percent, I get out as soon as possible. Sometimes with Gox that's hard to do, so I don't wait around looking for a bounce. As soon as you lose money, get out before you lose more.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:08:40

@_date: 2013-04-19 19:09:26
Make sure you understand everything on bitfinex's wiki first. Margin trading is powerful, but dangerous. Always have a stop order so you bail automatically in a sharp correction instead of getting locked out. The site tends to go down most often during those very corrections. Remember the rule, margin available must stay above twice the margin requirement or you'll get called. That said, if you wait until then, you'll have gone way past losing most of your stash, so don't think it will save you. Always have a stop order to limit losses in case of a sudden move. I say it twice because it's important.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:48:30
Not that I know of. I like bitfloor, cash deposit at any bank of america branch. Bitcoin tends to trade a bit higher on there because of the ease of use, but I've made back those couple percent and then some.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:03:38
Can you give a little more commentary so we can understand better what you're seeing?
I agree with you, though I hope it takes another few days at least, but not on that chart. Rather, the solid trend of the past 7 days suggests we're seeing a real increase rather than speculative. It just needs to be careful not to outstrip itself.

I like how nobody's mentioned trading. The fact that exchanges use a small percentage as a fee instead of a flat rate makes it viable no matter how little you have to start with. It's not easy, but it works. I make about 10% on a good day trading btc on Gox, and as I reinvest that into my capital, the profits increase. Consider learning some technical analysis and investing principles before you gamble away a btc on dice games.

This article is utter shit. It assumes that not only will the rapid growth in new user accounts experienced leading up to the crash continue throughout the year, but that user accounts will grow even faster every month. It also adds a value of $1000 for each account in line with forex exchanges, but forex usually has an account minimum of thousands. Most of those accounts have probably only ever dealt with 1-10 btc. Plenty of them are empty after the selloff, and never coming back.

The challenge is defining a "stable" currency. The yen is down 18% in the past 6 months against the USD. The euro's up 8% from it's low last year. 
Bitcoin spent the majority of the past 2 years extraordinarily stable compared to traditional currency. As adoption increases, it will grow in spurts and crashes for a while, but eventually level out. Don't worry about it.

Some of your numbers are off. You're calculating as though the fees are applied only to your profit. .6% of your 9.94BTC is $8.23, and .6% of your 10BTC is $7.68.
So while yes, you had about $16 taken out in fees, you can't calculate that as being taken out of your profit, you have to calculate it as being taken out of your whole order
You netted $83.49 profit from an initial investment of $1280, that's 6.522% profit. If you hadn't paid fees, you would have netted $100 from $1280, for 7.8125% profit. Does that make sense?
