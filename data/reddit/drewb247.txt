Whos to say they wouldnt just take my 500 the next day
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:46:02
you would never invest 5,000 with me because it is a scheme.  this is for people who are scared and unfamiliar with bitcoin.  sorry im not going to go out of my way and show them all the trends, sell them on it, educate them, cold storage etc for free

i dont believe its giving money away because i believe it will be worth exponentially more in 36 months.  and i havent thought that far about the day trading bit thank you tha k you for this information

Whats the private key
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:28:49
they buy 4500 and i put in 500 there is 5000 worth of bitcoin.  fast forward 3 years.  that 5000 we both put into that account is worth 10000.  my 500 is now 1,000 and potential client has  9,000.  what am i still not getting?

The way i profit is because i own 10 percent of the TOTAL we accumulate together
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:59:48
sure im retarded, thats why im on reddit to be called retarded, do you have a better idea
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:57:59
well the last bit will be held under the legal bounds of a contract and i am potentially dealing with people who hold in me in a higher regard than most.  thank you so much for your input.  now on the thing about it going to 20,000 hmm.  i would probably rather take that out and just stick with the 36 or however many months.  but id like the person to be able to take it out of theyd like to actually sell them on it but i obviously dont want them to sign the contract/bill take it out tomorrow and take my say 500 dollars if they put in 5000 dollars

great, now stay until they leave, casually leave at the same time and stalk them to their car, once they begin to pack their car full of beach equipment go up to them and put ur finger in their back and tell them to give you their cell phone and dont move.  make sure everything is unlocked, have your buddy point his finger through his shirt at them so it looks like a gun.  and you should be all set, if not then idk call the cops, create a distraction and run

this has upvotes because its giving people false hope about their investments.  indicates to me its time to sell and buy in lower, pce ✌
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:09:29
place is cool, they have novelty things like pins and stickers, shirts.  pretty sure all they accept is btc bch dash and ltc.  you cant go in and buy a shirt with dollars.  they also have a map of 8 to 10 businesses that accept crypto.  try going to Street really good food and they accept crypto
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:49:03
if it were a token and they airdopped it to us it would be a stimulus, that would be a nice idea
