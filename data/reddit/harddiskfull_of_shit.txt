A paper wallet is still going to be more secure than just about anything else, same logic there, you can easily create a multisig wallet and keep the seeds separate. Hardware fails: usb drives, hardware tokens, hard disks, etc are all much less trustworthy than a paper backup.

We can come  up with a dozen scenarios where it does make sense, still seems more likely that it's a conversation concocted within a spoofing app.

Then you're managing backup media, doing routine data integrity checks, remembering passwords, etc. It's way more hassle and the risk of something going wrong is greater.
I can't imagine you've dealt much with digital backups over long periods of time if you trust them enough to be your sole backup method.

Could also come from the Ledger folks, as one of the fundamental differences between the Ledger and Trezor devices is the open vs closed, insecure vs secure nature of the two devices.

Timing fuckface, not just the screenshot.

I'm calling BULLSHIT. 
Why would you have taken a screenshot at that moment?
The time on the system clock in the screenshot matches the time of your texts, which seems like an odd time to be taking screenshots if you're busy trying to call your mom. You already have the picture and the text conversation on your phone, so why would you be taking a screenshot in the middle of that? It wouldn't be an odd time to "take a screenshot" if you were using one of the many text conversation spoofing apps though.

"Safe" has different interpretations. I don't think passwords are a safe backup method when you can create multisig wallets instead. If you're putting coins into cold storage and don't plan on accessing them for a while, it's a risk to set a password on the wallet that you may forget. Alternatively, storing the seeds in separate locations is a much safer solution that only requires knowledge of and access to the locations. It is also a wiser decision when it comes to estate planning.

Paper backups are about the safest and most reliable method of backing up wallets, so not sure what you don't trust about them. Use 2-of-2 multisig, one key on your phone and the other on a hardware device; then you can keep your two paper recovery seeds in different locations.  For a general use wallet, what's more secure than that?
