I want to do this with those physical BTC coins.

He likes the idea because he wants to make upper middle class and wealthier even more wealthy with his own take on Bitcoin. Enter tZero ICO; you can invest if you spend $59 to become an accredited investor and have to prove that you've made $200k a year for the last couple years. The dudes smart but I don't like how he's going about his ICO.

 so since I don't fall under the 200k+ a year category how can I become accredited?

So you're telling me that one speculative widget is worth more than another because... banks? I like the conspiracy theory for sure and maybe it's right but it's just speculation.

 No, no it isn't and doesn't change the fact that you need to already be way above the average income in the US let alone anywhere in the world. Down vote me all you like but it's a shitty way to do business.

I've also owned Macs, supported and repaired them; they aren't fault free and tend to have their own problems as well. In some cases more catastrophic failure concerning their SSD and OS upgrades that don't boot up again.

I love comments about how Windows doesn't work, I've created images for multiple companies for Windows (multiple models/driver sets) and if you know how to setup Windows with AD, GPO, scripting software installations, and maintain the OS you can have an extremely smooth experience. Those who complain about problems are probably blaming third party support of a product that goes into Windows rather than the actual product of Windows itself.

Holy fuck, greatest clip ever.
