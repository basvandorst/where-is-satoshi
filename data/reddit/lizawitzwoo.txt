This coinmap is amazing! I wasn't expecting to find information in Toronto. I get paid in Crypto and the challenge was always going to fiat to pay bills, ignoring the crypto volatility. It was the time for an exchange to settle it and the withdrawal to fiat fee.   A p2p fiat exchange would run up to 2%.  Coinsquare.com charges up to 2% and makes customers wait 3-5 days unless you pay a premium.  VirgoCX.ca charges a 1% withdrawal fee and it is immediate.

Who in Canada do you think is good at this? 
I've learned that proof of reserves can be a false sense of hope.  All that means is that auditors, only check the exchange coverage based on a the day they arrive.  They don't do a random check or continous coverage check.  Each auditor is different too. If they are third party that the exchange hired, or is it a bank audit. 
Kinda like when you have friends over for dinner and you tidy up the house and make it look perfect they day they come over. 
I think governance overall, but how do you demonstrate strong governance? 
Plus, the ability to move in and out of an exchange with fiat also depends on strong banking relationships.
I am learning what banks expect trading platforms to demonstrate in order to be "in good" standing.
Each bank has different requirements, not there yet.

If Virgocx advertises, call them out. Exchanges that put themselves out there and deal head-on with controversial topics, have guts.  No guts no glory.  Kraken is a good example of an exchange that is trying hard to be transparent.  OkEX, just started doing monthly AMAs.  Now  VirgoCX is putting themselves out there. Not easy to do.

Old School in 2020 is not a slam dunk for any business and for super hard for crypto.  Driving consistent traffic on google, Instagram and FB is tricky.  If you know any old school ways for 2020, do share.  I am stumped.
