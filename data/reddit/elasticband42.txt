Maybe for the organisers but not the attendees. I LOVE bitcoin and live in A'dam but will not attend at those prices, even though I could afford it I still feel its a rip off price.

Hey Dave, Good to see your doing well and have been traveling around! Are you attending the A'dam conference again this year?
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:00:46
Filmhuis cavia on van hal straat, kind of out old west north west.
It is just bottled beer, but there is a bitcoin meetup group there every sporadic wednesday so I found out.
There are several restraunts where you can probably go also and just buy a beer. Check coinmap.
Feel free to shout me if you fancy a bitcoin beer one day.

If their expenses are so high it prices avarage users out of attending then they should have considered video link to save costs, time, emissions and space.

no cannabis coffeeshops accept bitcoin and due to the grey are of their supply chain i doubt they will anytime soon.

We are all Nakamoto, the ideology that lives in us all  and brings us together. You found Nakamoto when you first owned some bitcoins.

Good to know man! Your GF is one tolerant woman, very lucky man. you should treat her to a trip to A'dam for some fashion, food and architecture. I don't think I will be artending and I might even be back in the UK that week. If I am here, we will have to meet up and yeah boat ride is always possible, I may even own a small own by then.

I love bitcoin(long term user), meeting bitcoin people, learning of projects, sharing and hearing ideas. I also live in Amsterdam and would not pay 400e (quarter of my monthly rent without bills, yes i live i nice life) to goto a couple of days at a conference. Enjoy folks!
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:24:09
None. Cannabis is tolerated here, the coffeeshop supply chain is illegal It will be a long while before you can use btc in a CS.
coinmap.org for all your local bitcoin needs.

your title is misleading. The quote is - "The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way"

Why not turn your saturns into jupiters and safe on space. I owned several jupiters and overlocked them heavily with extra cooling, never were they that loud!

Also I am from scotlan(NE), although no longer living there I appreciate how it can help in winter. Summer, although short is upon you.

I am not a student. The Netherlands already is and has been an import part of the bitcoin community. Websites like  (just eat of NL) who have accepted BTC for over a year now, Happycoins.nl &amp; Bitonic have operated pretty seamlessly for me over the last year and a half.
It's a cool country in general with a high quality of living in my opinion.

My experience tonight as posted on bitcointalk - 
Just used the new feature. Within 30minutea of posting my listing I was contacted by a bitcoin meet up group. I had no idea about thus in Amsterdam on the NEXT street from my apartment!!! Within an hour of making my listing I had met and traded and drank some beer and even bought the beer with bitcoin!
What an amazing experience.
This was my first bitcoin bought beer. The option has been available but I have just never chosen to go to a restaurant to buy a beer with btc.
This random event made my first btc beer that little bit more special in an unknown btc location and it was all because of randomly looking at this thread tonight ( I did already own the wallet) and meeting some cool people right next to my apartment. Small world in a busy(small) city.
Thank you Mycelium!

Well I am not 100% certain yet, as i imagine it will involve postage. The other forum i am giving away on is easy. It is an Amsterdam Coffeeshop based forum and I live in Amsterdam so can meet people f2f - 
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:53:40
any alternatives for the moment?

I expected some kind of troll like comments at some point, I am offering a gift as a learning experience not for those who want to get rich. I really hope you would not be unimpressed if someone gifted you something?
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:23:00
It appears I may have answered my own question, as i said i am new to reddit, but i did not think there would be a r/Amsterdam, I guess i will start there.
