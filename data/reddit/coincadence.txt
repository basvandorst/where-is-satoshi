"In any or every place; in all places."
Yep, exactly what I meant as a 'generalization':
"A generalization is a concept in the inductive sense of that word, or an extension of the concept to less-specific criteria. Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements. As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences. The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation."

Running a Pi as a full node eats up most of your resources, but that would be step 1, lots of tutorials, here is a decent one: 
Then you have access to the Bitcoin RPC on the Pi and can have it do pretty much whatever you want... You can play around with the RPC through a web interface here: 
If you want to spend a little more you can get a 21 Bitcoin Computer and earn some Satoshis with the mining chip while running a full node on the Pi:

Yes we do.
I'm a small miner, but like most we like to include TXs with fees vs. those without.
I'm also a big supporter of decentralization, and in particular mining decentralization. 
Take a look at my P2Pool node:  and yes, we (P2Pool) are in the middle of an emergency hard fork with BIP 66 enforcement imminent.


I'm not complaining about fees. I'm concerned about a future where **high fees** exclude typical users from transacting on the network.
What I do not want is to create a market of transaction scarcity by forcing higher fees through a imposed block size limit that ends up too small to include the majority of transaction demand before that demand exceeds reasonable technical limits.
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:11:28

@_date: 2015-12-18 01:41:37
Miners already can set minimum fees and a maximum block size (as long as it is under any hard cap) for any transactions they choose to process.

I think we absolutely need a future fee market. I don't think we need to forcibly create it by artificially limiting the amount of transactions today.
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:11:39


@_date: 2015-12-14 16:01:05
BIP65 includes OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, which allows you to set a date or block height in the future that a transaction can not be included in a block until.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:06:21
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:47:33


One thing not mentioned that I think is also important to consider: 
* The fee market will be bootstrapped when blocks are mostly full 
* If there is a block size increase after the future fee market is established (pretty much no one sees the block limit staying at 1MB forever) the existing fee market will be completely disrupted
* A new and second future fee market will need to be bootstrapped
IMO this will bring a new level of chaos, confusion and FUD to bitcoin that will most certainly cripple adoption and use.
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:35:35
Correct. 21 mine is running, but mining to 21's pool, just a proof of concept. A single 21 comp would never be able to maintain a share in P2Pool's share chain, 100's or 1,000's of them sure could though ;)

I would agree, this is already pretty much how it works with large pools, working with P2Pool orphans are really not an issue, so we don't worry about it to much. On top of everything already discussed to disincentivize the slow to process block, miners still have ultimate control on anything less than max block size. Remove the limit, let miners decide what to include....

Whats surprising, since you made the inflammatory comment, is your lack of knowledge on the goals of Byrne's T0 platform. 
If you had spent even just a minute educating yourself you would quickly see that the type of transparency and friction elimination he is working to create can only be accomplished with a decentralized trustless ledger.
I think using the Bitcoin blockchain for securities settlement is an awesome and ambitious idea. 
Trying to stifle innovation by pigeonholing bitcoin into the specific application of whatever YOU think it is for is the tragedy.

I know you will understand this, but I'll explain it for those unfamiliar with bitcoin.conf...






Using the bitcoin.conf file miners already have a simple means of controlling what transactions they will include in a block, as well as what transactions their full node will relay to other nodes in relation to the transaction fee.
Why would this not continue to work as it has for the last 6 years?
This is really some game theory level stuff, but it is working as designed and I believe will continue to with blocks large enough to be inclusive of the super majority of transactions without creating "transaction scarcity".

If Bitcoin is meant is meant to be a form of money this is not a good idea for 2 reasons:
Money must be durable and should not decay over time.
Money must be fungible (any one can be exchanged for any other without impacting value)  and older UTXOs should have no more value then newer ones (but in Bitcoin have a higher priority in processing).

This is actually the best defense, and one that pretty much all large pools are doing already, albeit currently working on the big blocks headers... A simple "if block will take more then X time to processs = SPV mine on previous block header" (which may already be implemented by some miners) is all it would take to disincentivize the behavior....

Right now it is not determined by either. It is determined by an imposed 1MB hard cap that was imposed for reasons that are no longer valid.


I'd prefer not to, but not at the cost of excluding people from the network who could easily be included given today's technical limits. A broadband connection, a home computer from this decade, a decent size hard drive and a handful of RAM is all that would be required.

I'm not sure where your getting the "free transactions yay" garbage from, the vast majority of transactions already include a fee today, a month ago that fee was suggested at 0.0001. Right now, estimate fee suggests a 0.00044345 fee to be included in the next block:
This is an over 300% increase in a very short time, and this forced fee market is just getting warmed up.

@_date: 2015-06-24 15:26:33
Well, all blocks are found by a single node, blocks that are found by p2pool may be found by any one of the online p2pool nodes. If there were only 2 p2pool nodes, each with equal hash rate, they would each have the same chance of finding the next block.
P2Pool is completely decentralized, where centralized pools expose all miners as a single entity, each p2pool node has a complete copy of p2pool's share chain and functions as a stand alone node. If a p2pool node I'm mining on goes down for some reason I can switch to any other p2pool node and continue working without loosing any of my shares.

BIP65 "OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY" is currently a little over 50% of the way to enforcement (643 of the last 1000 blocks, 950 required for enforcement).
It allows you to pre-sign a transaction that cannot be included in a block (i.e. Spent) until a given block height or block time stamp (date) in the future.
It's not the same as locking to an amount, but is possible today and can be used to try and achieve the same effect your looking for.

Sorry, but 332976 is not a record block, not by a long shot... 
Block # 332976 contains only 869 transactions
The real record block:
Block # 256961 contains the most transactions of any current block; 3,861
The blockchain.info charts are a little wonky...
Here is some hard data on transaction volume pulled from the Bitcoin blockchain on one of my nodes: 
EDIT: In looking at the blockchain.info chart more closely, the title is very misleading. It is certainly NOT representative of the actual number of transactions per block, my assumption (which I'm forced to make because they do not disclose it) is that they use some kind of moving average of transactions per x blocks.
If you look at the data for all time in their chart it shows 804 transactions as the most ever included in a block, if you look at the actual bitcoin blockchain there are currently 5,132 blocks that contain over 1,000 transactions.
Love the transparency of the real blockchain, wish blockchain.info would change the title and explain their calculations on the page, in it's current state it is very misleading.

From bitcoins perspective they cant. 
All times are in UTC. It is an established convention of the core bitcoin protocol. 
Often sites will convert the time for the users benefit, but the data they pull from the bitcoin blockchain is in UTC.
If they convert the time then their data is not representative of the real blockchain.

The number of confirmations represents the number of blocks that have been found that include your transaction.
When you first send a transaction to the network it will have 0 confirmations, when the next block is found it will have 1 confirmation, and so on...
The higher the number of confirmations, the harder it is for a double spend to occur.
Generally for small transactions, like a coffee, a single confirmation is plenty, for higher value transactions 6 confirmations is the current generally accepted standard.
A block is expected to be found about every 10 minutes, so typically six confirmations takes about an hour.
While 6 confirmations has proven to be enough to guarantee the payment will not be reversed (double spent), mining rewards require 120 confirmations before they can be spent.

Like I said near the beginning of my post, I know my data is not perfect, there were occasionally non-standard transactions (mentioned in post) and nulldata scripts that caused my collector to throw errors.
I may work on trying to solve some of the errors and reprocessing the blockchain, or storing error transactions separately so they can be looked at later.
For this first run if I could not identify an unspent transaction because of some error I had not anticipated it was simply discarded.

Bitcoin will not fit the proposed E-Peso model, they want traditional Government backed controls:
"Regarding distribution, Cojuangco said the amount of E-Pesos in circulation would not exceed 1 billion units in the first two years.

Correct, this is the raw amount of transactions, nothing to do with amount of BTC at all (and in my opinion USD charts are completely irrelevant here). I will make some notations on the charts this week to explain exactly what is being shown.
Also noteworthy is that a huge volume of transactions happen off-chain these days (changetip, coinbase, on-exchange trades, etc...), which was not the case a year ago, and still we see growth. 
These graphs are simply the number of transactions processed by miners on the blockchain.
There are actually no "gaps", it is the total of each month charted by year, after the end of the month (that is why December 2014 is not included yet) the full data set in on the main charts page so you can create your own charts if you would like...

Trezor uses a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) seed (12, 16 or 24 words) + a password of your choice, + a pin number that is jumbled on a matrix on the screen so keyloggers are useless.
Assuming it is set up when you plug in your Trezor you will be asked for the password (essentially an extra word in the HD setup), without the correct password you can't even generate the public keys.
When you create a transaction at myTrezor the device will ask for your pin, derived from the on screen matrix, after the pin is correctly input you will confirm the actual transaction being signed on the devices screen (twice), if you confirm the tx the device will sign it and myTrezor will broadcast it to the network.
Your private keys never leave the secure device. There is no way to "get" the private keys off the device.
Without the physical device in hand the only way to steal the private keys is to know the 24 words, password, and pin.
With the device the only way to sign a tx is with the password and pin.
Entering an incorrect password will simply create a new wallet with a 0 balance.
Entering an incorrect PIN will double the time you have to wait to enter another try, if you don't know the pin the time between tries doubles for each incorrect input. This prevents the pin from being brute forced.
The developers do not know any of the 3 pieces of the security puzzle - the HD word list is generated on the device when you set it up (using strong entropy viewable in the source), and you pick the password and pin.
Short of putting your Trezor in a vault and surrounding it with men with guns it is as secure as it can get.

In looking at this, it uses LevelDB which requires a key to retrieve a value, so I don't believe it is technically "queryable".
i.e. you cant ask it to return the number of transaction per day without first processing the entire blockchain into another means of storage (like an xSQL database)...

@_date: 2014-12-28 20:50:06
My **highlight** reel from the article :)
* Our estimates suggest that the number of daily users has doubled every eight months.
* As of October 7, 2014 more than 64,000 businesses were reported to accept payments in bitcoins around the world, and the exchange rate was more than U.S.$300 to the bitcoin, which is more than 50 times higher than 24 months earlier.
* As the diagram suggests, the entities transact directly, that is, in contrast to most traditional payment systems where various parties, such as banks, processors, and networks, sit between the payor and payee, there is no designated intermediary in Bitcoin.
* Because the rate of making transaction records is stable over time, there is some certainty about the rate of growth of
bitcoins (hence the amount of bitcoins in circulation).
* Moreover, because the rate of growth of bitcoins is set to decrease exponentially, the total amount of bitcoins is bounded at 21 million and the bound is expected to be reached in 2140.
* Decentralized systems such as Bitcoin replace third party intermediaries and the records kept by them with the public
ledger maintained by a distributed information system.
* It appears that, accounting for the large mean growth of bitcoin value, the risk associated with holding bitcoins for very short periods of time has remained relatively stable. Notably, however, the disruptions in the normalized exchange rate volatility are of substantial magnitude and appear difficult to explain or to predict.

"Financial inclusion activists are also excited about digital currencies such as bitcoin, which bypass fee-collecting financial intermediaries and which, unlike banks, tolerate very small transactions at low cost.
Bitcoin’s price volatility and reports of illicit usage and stolen funds haven’t exactly endeared it to poor people. But digital currency’s real promise lies in its underlying decentralized technology, a base infrastructure that allows digital value exchanges in any form. Digital currency startups such as Ripple Labs and BitReserve already allow cheap transfers of claims in dollars and other mainstream currencies."

The really sad thing is the Circle jumps on the "it's for your own security" bandwagon, which is total BS.
It is about 1 thing, attaching your identity to your BTC.
How can that possibly ensure your security? 
Collecting, verifying, and storing this information is only good for 2 things:

A little tuff love...
Very few websites, and especially e-commerce websites, launch and are an overnight success. The Internet is not a field of dreams where if you build it they will come; building a business online takes time and dedication.
I found your most popular sales thread: 
Objections seem to be (in order of ranking):
* They want CPUs and not GPUs
* A warranty where you threaten to have customers charged with mail fraud if they return a GPU that does not meet your criteria
* That you do not offer International shipping
* The fact that it is a small new business and may fail without any recourse for the warranty
* Lack of large selection
* No Nvidia GPU's
After all those objections comes:
* You ran a GPU mining farm
* All the GPUs offered are those that are known to be good miners...
It is your job to overcome these objections.
Honestly, I think the problem is more a lack of credibility (as a new business), and the fact that you were an active GPU miner sharing on reddit certainly raises some red flags about whether or not the GPUs were used for mining (whether they were or not)...
Perhaps there is some way you can prove the disposition of the GPUs you used for mining, however there really did not seem to be a whole lot of people itching to buy from the reddit thread I read. 
At 3 days into your new business, I'd suggest looking for some other channels to attract new customers, and perhaps addressing the major objections you discovered in your posts: 
Offer CPUs as well, fix your warranty (make a big promise, keep it, and make it easy for the customer), offer International shipping (it's really pretty easy), increase your selection (Nvidia seems like a good place to start), if they were not used for mining say so on the site, maybe in a FAQ.
I do not think that removing or keeping BTC as a payment option will have a major effect on your overall outcome.
Just my 2 bits, take it for what you will.
Best of luck with your new business. :)

A cold storage system should meet a handful of criteria:

* The only outputs from the system should be signed transactions or messages

11 Days later, would love to speak with the PETAMINE folks about what we can provide with 0 fee...
PETAMINE is the PERFECT match for p2pool.
Joining p2pool would provide PETAMINE with an excellent balance between variance and amount of payout per block. 
You can capitalize on the existing hash rate and data, and at the same time become the largest single miner in the pool.
It’s a win/win for existing p2pool miners and PETAMINE.
I don’t know how far along the vote is, and we are about 75% of the way there with the most data rich and reliable p2pool node front-end on the planet.
We have more stats publicly available in an easy to use and understand interface then anywhere else.
Coin Cadence is 100% on board to provide our interface for PETAMINE miners at no charge and a 0% ongoing fee.
The interface can be previewed here: 
I can be reached via the site above, reddit.com. bitcointalk.com (windpath), Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or email.
Happy to work with PETAMINE and get the decentralized, trust less ball rolling!

 Toshi is a standalone node (connects to bitcoin network on its own without bitcoind) being developed to run the CoinBase backend and runs on Python/Redis/PostgreSQL

I don't claim that I have found all the "unspendable" transactions here, just that I was able to identify some of them.

No way to say this without sounding like an arrogant ass, but here goes:
My data is correct. Blockchain.info's data is inaccurate.


The Bitcoin protocol clearly specifies UTC, not 24 hour periods counting from the timestamp of the genesis block. A day is a day, a 24 hour period (as measured by UTC in Bitcoin's case).
This may be the source of the problem, and if it is, blockchain.info ~~should~~ could fix it easily as I'm sure they store the correct timestamps.

I do not know how blockchain.info stores the blockchain or where they are pulling the data from. I do know that you can not get directly from the blockchain as stored by bitcoind to "transactions per day", there is nothing in the core client capable of doing that.
There are lots of reasons it could be inaccurate... Maybe they are counting transactions that never confirmed, maybe they are using a timezone other than UTC (all bitcoin timestamps are in UTC so there is never a reason to convert them when you display historical data), maybe in the code that generates the graph there is a typo or error....
Only blockchain.info would be capable of figuring out where they went wrong...

That being said, our luck currently stinks!
But if theirs one thing you can say about luck; it is sure to change ;)
p2pool.info being down for over a month has made it hard for many p2pool miners to see what the pool is doing globally, with the help of many others at bitcointalk I have been developing a new global p2pool statistics front end, a big piece of which was finished today.

Hmm... It was never a scam, the previous owner ran it as a 2% fee public node. I am the current owner and have chosen to make it an information resource for p2pool. We do not run a public mining node on p2pool.org, and do not charge anything anywhere, what exactly would we be trying to scam out of you? Like I said, it is just a free information resource for the pool. Forrest Voight, p2pools creator, owns p2pool.in, it has not been updated in over a year.

Would seem like a smart move to try on your own.
I've thought about it, but have not invested in setting up and funding the various exchange accounts required to give it a try. Btc-arbs looks "interesting", but I'd like to see some proof or hear about some experiences before jumping in.
We have seen over a $30 difference in the spot price since March 7th on 
Right now CampBX is at $584.50 and Bitfinex is at $562.27, not accounting for fees that's a $22.23 profit per BTC (if you had funds ready to go in both exchanges).

It would have to be something disastrous, something causing an unexpected hard fork for example, to get node consensus to change to new code in 30 days.
What Gavin wants to do is schedule the hard fork now, allow time for testing, and allow the network time to upgrade to versions that include the scheduled hard fork.
This scheduling is vital to prevent the need for an urgent hard fork.

Nice paper, congrats on getting published.
Strong conclusion:


transaction of value without trusting in traditional institutions.
Banks and payment processors aren't necessary in the Bitcoin ecosystem; the trade is peer to peer and
no third party has to be trusted with the funds. Central banks aren't necessary; the issuance of new
currency is determined by a predictable algorithm. Governmental bodies aren't necessary; the
transaction isn't secured by the rule of law but instead by mathematical laws in the cryptography.
This new system has low barriers to entry and cannot be manipulated by any central organization. The
cost for sending bitcoins is significantly lower than existing systems, and it is also substantially faster.
If the technological infrastructure in developing nations grows, Bitcoin could give previously unbanked
individuals the opportunity to connect to a global trade network without needing to pay fees or submit

I'm not sure I agree it has been proven wrong, or even that he did not "get his way" as you put it.
If you read the rest of the chat log you cited you see that as soon as BTCGuild (then a huge miner) assured the chat that they had enough hashrate to reverse the fork he asked them to go ahead and do that and then Gavin set the alert in the 0.8 clients to downgrade back to 0.7 immediately.

If every block were at the 1MB limit bitcoin breaks down, this is not a fix it once it breaks problem....
- The unconfirmed TX pool bloats and floods the memory of nodes
- Valid unconfirmed transactions drop out of the memory pool because there is no room
- Those transactions have to be re-broadcast to confirm
- Network grinds to a halt with bloated unconfirmed TX pools and thousands of re-boradcasts
- To even have a chance at getting confirmed TX fees spike 
This limit was an afterthought of Satoshis, and was never intended to remain in place.

This is an awesome post, thank you!
I have three bits to add....
1. We need to increase the blocksize, and we need to schedule the fork yesterday.
2. Other then Gavin's proposal, and the over-time based variations, there is currently nothing else REAL and READY on the table that is proposed to solve this.
3. "The mob is fickle, brother"... After reading your post (and the links) I'm more open to a solution that includes some kind of scaling over time, I don't often agree with Peter Todd, but in this case a scaling over time solution seems to be the safest achievable direction.
TL;DR: The fork is required. We need to schedule the fork ASAP. Either 20MB or some type of growth-over-time solution, but we need to schedule it now....

Bitcoin already has a built in mechanism that will display an error when more than 50 of the last 100 blocks mined are a higher block version then what your node is working on.
"Warning: This version is obsolete, upgrade required!" will display once this occurs.
In essence, once a majority of miners update to a new block version bitcoin will warn you that you are out of date, and not in agreement with the majority of the network with regards to block version.
Code reference: 
For my P2Pool node this has already occurred prompting an upgrade from core 0.9.x to 0.10.x, once the big miners update to a new version it will not be long until you are prompted to upgrade.

Password 1: where you keep all your bitcoin

Hi, P2Pool.org maintainer here (not the p2pool source, just the .org site)...
Thanks for starting this thread :)


Because P2Pool pays miners directly from the generation transaction our rewards tend to have a higher variance then a centralized pool, however this is what makes P2Pool trustless.
**The rewards over time tend to be the same, or a little better then a typical pool.**
As mentioned P2Pool has a donation feature built in that will divide a given donation amount proportionally between active miners.
**There is a handy web based interface to set up a donation transaction here:

I do not believe the genesis block reward can be spent, something to do with actually creating the first block with no previous block to build on.
However there are many early bock rewards that must have belonged to Satoshi, signing (or spending) the reward from block  ( was genesis) would confirm control of the private key.

All bitcoins that are and ever will be were created by miners.
For the first 4 years the reward per block mined was 50 BTC, today it is 25 BTC, and the reward will be cut in half again in 2016, and every 4 years until all the bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined (~21,000,000).
The last "generation transaction" (i.e. mined new coins) will occur somewhere around 2140.

P2Pool (decentralized, trust-less mining pool) has a built in donation mechanism to support miners and node operators.
You tell it the amount you want to donate and it builds a transaction that fairly distributes it to active P2Pool miners.
There is even an easy to use web based front end for it:
Something similar could be built for Bitcoin node operators, the caveat is that many full node node operators do not use the Bitcoin core wallet so you would have to identify a way to designate a donation address on a per node basis.

Just wanted to add my 0.02 bits to the title and in response to some of the comments.
Bit .01: **There are no "fake" transactions in the ledger**, every transaction is real and exists. The data used here is collected from 3 separate nodes (2 bitcoind, 1 toshi) and cross verified for accuracy. 
Bit .02: **"Real" transactions are not hard or expensive to create**, one of the beautiful things about bitcoin. There is some speculation that "they" are inflating transaction volume by sending to self, or creating many small transactions. This is absolutely possible. Is it happening? I do not know for sure.
These 2 bits combined equal a metric that may not accurately measure the adoption rate or growth of bitcoin, however it does accurately represent the number of transactions sent across the network. And the network has clearly been handling exponentially more transactions every year.
The actual transaction volume is not up for debate, it is what it is. The motives behind those transactions can be speculated on until the fat lady sings, or chokes on an olive...

@_date: 2015-01-09 05:18:46
Well, two points I'd like to make:
1. A transaction is a transaction. There are no "fake" or "throwaway" confirmed transactions, they are real. It is broadcast to the network, included in a block by a miner (usually for a small fee), and recorded immutably in the ledger. It will exist there forever.
2. One of the major breakthroughs of Bitcoin is that transactions are inexpensive and easy to create. Anyone on a modest budget can create thousands of transactions if they desire, and people may be doing this to manipulate the volume.  
Transaction volume is not a perfect metric, but it is a measure of what the network has proven can be handled in a day.

Yes, they can. If all miners agree to mine 100kb blocks and set the minimum transaction fee to 1BTC per kb then that is the new Bitcoin. They could do this today without any forks or change to the protocol. They do not because it is not in their best interest to do so.
They believe it is also not in their best interest to keep an artificially imposed cap at 1MB. This is how Bitcoin incentives were designed to work from the beginning. Growth and innovation will not be stifled. The market will demand what it needs, and it will get it one way or another.

Solid analysis, but I disagree with the solution. The fact is this debate has been going on for years, and has recently become a hotbed of hostility and shit slinging. 
To me this seems like a great (and possibly the best we will ever see) opportunity to permanently end the block size debate.
Instead of kicking the can down the road and simply increasing the hard block size cap let's set in code a permanent solution.

I'm not 100%, but I believe it was because the problem it solved (antivirus software incorrectly triggering on the blockchain files) only impacted Windows users running a specific anitvirus. If your running windows and have an antivirus that falsely identifies block data files as a virus then you can simply enable it. However this effected a small number of users.

The game theory dictates that miners do what is in their best financial interest. With a limited block size and exponentially increasing fees it will make more short term sense to keep things congested and drive up transaction costs.

SPV mining only allows miners to start work faster on the next empty block header, it does not allow for faster propagation of a large mined block.
So irregardless of SPV mining, larger blocks still have a higher orphan risk.

I think you mixed up private and public keys here...
Their are no "weird" valid private keys. 
Their are no weird valid public keys, only those for which you have the private key for, and those you do not.
Rolling dice is a highly secure way to generate an offline private key, better still flip a coin....
My suggestion would be to give it a try... roll the dice to create a private key, derive a public key, send a small amount of BTC, then spend it...

Thanks, this is very helpful, but still leaves some questions. 
Going through the last 50 blocks it seems there are still plenty of version 2 (what my 0.9.x node was using), the last 50 were definitely not all version 3, but perhaps a majority.
Is it an average version of the last 50 blocks? 
Then I could see how you might end up with a block version average of the last 50 blocks of 2.x where x&gt;0?

Fair enough, my bad.
Bitcoin addresses are intended to be single use. They can be reused, and often are, but at the sacrifice of privacy for all parties involved. It’s generally considered a bad idea to reuse addresses.
The current generation of trusted bitcoin wallets use HD keys (hierarchical deterministic). This is a single key from wich many bitcoin addresses can be generated. It’s (the HD key) what you back up to protect as many addresses as you want.
With an HD wallet you have a single “seed” to back up, and an unlimited number of public addresses to use.
Look at BIP32 and  for more info on how HD addresses work

Back then 10k was the moon. It was the number many of us held onto as a symbol of wildly successful foresight, an achievement that if reached validated many of our assumptions and beliefs. Bitcoins USD price had gone from over $1000 back down to the low hundreds of dollars precipitated by the fall of MtGox. It was a dark time, suicide hotlines were posted all over the bitcoin space, but some of us still believed in the fundamental technology and ideology, Draper was among us (and still is).
I'd say a comparable number today would be $100,000. For many it seems completely ridiculous. But for those who believe in bitcoin's potential it is a forgone conclusion.
Since I first fell down the rabbit hole and really gained an understanding of the technology, how it works, and what its implications are I have always believed that bitcoin in the future will either be worth exponentially more or nothing. Ever day it has survived it has trended toward exponentially more.

You are right, the max block size of 1MB is not changed.

It does not increase the maximum block size, however it does allow more transactions to fit within the current 1MB limit.

Segwit is by no means simple. In fact the current pull request for SegWit has changes in 80 of bitcoin core's files, and adds over 5,000 lines of code. It would be much simpler to simply increase or remove altogether the max blocksize limit. 
Segwit's main purpose is to fix transaction malleability, with an increase in transaction capacity (as wallets and services adopt it) as an added bonus.

The real problem is that the IRS has been known in the past to use these John Doe warrants, which have a very successful history of being upheld by the courts, and then sharing that information with other government organizations that otherwise would have no way to obtain it.

Semantics. Transferring the sole means to alter the only Bitcoin client then in existence was transferring  control from Satoshi to Gavin, who incedentaly worked to distribute that power to where it has ended up today.

Bitcoin IS the first working implementation of decentralized consensus. It's what's under the hood that makes it work. (Seriously, it's worth learning about, powerful stuff)
If Satoshi had not invented a working system for decentralized consensus bitcoin would not exist.
Basically Greg was wrong, and admitted it, no big deal. What is a big deal is his semantic attacks on who Satoshi left in control of the codebase. No need to rewrite history.
Edit: here is a latter quote from Greg supporting what I'm saying is true:

The fact that Satoshi vanished and the ONLY individual that he had granted commit access to was Gavin is proof enough. Greg is well aware of this and simply trolling for his own ego and satisfaction. It is pathetic. Shows a complete lack of any kind of leadership ability, and is just generally shitty.
Greg was busy yelling the world that he had "proven" Bitcoin could never work while Gavin was writing code and improving the protocol. Greg wants to rewrite history for his own benefit.
Well I for one will call bullshit.

The psychology of it all is very interesting, however I'm not sure parity with any other currency is attainable for any period of time...

I'm not sure how this is a good thing, maybe someone can explain it?
As I understand it all nodes are supposed to relay transactions that meet their minimum relay fee requirement to all the other nodes they are connected to. This is how transactions propagate through to mempool and have the best chance to be included in subsequent blocks.
It would seem that if this service or others like it became popularized transactions and their fees could be horded by popular miners increasing centralization.

No, they won't, the witness data (in your example 0.7MB) is segregated, hence the seg in segwit, and stored outside of the traditional 1MB cap, old nodes will not download the separate witnesses data, or understand those transactions without downloading the witness.

I believe segwit will fail to reach enforcement, there is just too much technical debt and division in the community to shoe horn it in as a soft fork.

What makes you think I'm blocking SegWit? I'm not. 
SegWit, while not a great scaling solution does fix mailability and pave the way for many off-chain services. 
It is not however a long term scaling solution and will not address the capacity problems the network is currently facing in any substantial way.

People often talk about how it's irrelevant to post satoshi quotes as guidance for the direction of todays bitcoin, while this argument has some merit, I do still believe there is a lot to be gained from Satoshi's words.
I also find it interesting that the thread containing the quote you sighted is from way back in 2010, and serendipitously is about the block size debate. Satoshi's very next comment in that thread is:

I understand what your saying, but disagree.
In the case of the fork you are talking about a miners SPV was mis configured and produced invalid blocks, which other mis configured SPV miners built on, it was quickly addressed and the miners on the wrong chain with more work lost all of those mined coins, the game theory in action... extend the wrong chain, loose money.

I think the point is making is an important one. 
If what your saying happens so rampantly then why is there no evidence of it? Why don't you approach them as a BU miner and see if you get some kind of special treatment, document it, and expose this huge scandal to the world?
I'm a small fry, but have still placed 6 orders with bitmain over the years. Having been around mining for a while I can assure you they are the longest standing, regularly delivering bitcoin ASIC manufacturer on the planet. They are indisputably  in the industry. I'd be surprised if the network was less then 75% of miners Bitmain sold or operate.
Now you can look at that as a monopoly, or an invitation for stronger competition. I thought Spondoolies had a shot, but they mismanaged their business into the ground just as they were getting ready to take of.
There will be at least 1 other major ASIC manufacturer that sells to the public, the demand is clearly there.
In the meantime, Bitmain has manufactured and sold a large proportion of the security the bitcoin network enjoys.

Without the miners there is no security. Also you can not simply "abandon" miners who don't agree with you.
The miners vote plain and simple:  "They vote with their hashpower".
It's often misrepresented here that somehow the miners would collude to do harm to the users in some way, however the entire bitcoin system is designed around the game theory that the miners are incentivized to do what's in the best interest of protecting the value that they have mined.

Not to jump in a heated argument, but I think you'd both have to define "blocksize" before stoning each other.
To me "segregated" means that it is not part of the blocksize as defined in the protocol. 
Segwit, by name and function, creates a space outside of the current protocol where blockchain data is stored, which only nodes that adopt segwit will fully understand.
The main benefit is that with segwit txid's are longer mailable before confirmation. Maliability is an important fix.
However, is a soft fork and everything else that comes with segwit worth it? I'm not so sure.

The thing is that users do not decide which chain to extend, and in most cases miners don't either.
The chain that is extended is the one with the most work.
There are some edge case exceptions like withholding attacks, but these are short lived and have been shown to be economically unprofitable, hence they don't happen very often. The game theory disincentivises it.

No need to get personal, and believe me, we are already on the battlefield.
I'm not sure I proposed a solution, other then to say the arbitrary limit is no longer needed at the 1MB level, we have reached it and there is plenty of room to raise it. 
Let's do it before it becomes a more serious issue that requires rushed decisions and emergency hard forks. At least now, today, we have an opportunity to plan it.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:15:44
Don't get me wrong, I think sidechains are brilliant and will add huge value, but they are not ready yet. 
Forks are tuff, even the BIP66 planed "soft fork", which was well planned and well known caused several hard forks when it was enforced.
I'd love to see a long term solution to the block size cap that does exactly what you want, allow for future improvements without disrupting things. Please show it to me :) 
Until then, I believe we are ready today for larger blocks and need to get moving before capacity is reached and an artificial fee market arises out of an arbitrary limit, or worse. Think how hard it will be to re-boot that fee market when block size is inevitably increased.
@_date: 2015-08-29 01:40:39
Enforcement = ensuring the rules that are in place are followed
Control = establishing the rules to be enforced
And as a side note, many of the miners voting for BIP100 were not even enforcing the most basic of rules, like verifying transactions, when the BIP66 fork occurred.

It's just a matter of putting the transaction together, signing with M keys, and pushing to the network.
I think if you have all the keys it can be done with the core bitcoin API RPC:
Create the transaction: [createrawtransaction](
Sign the transaction (include M keys in privatekeys argument): [signrawtransaction](
Send it to the network: [sendrawtransaction](

To be fair it counts some. To both open and close a lightning channel requires a bitcoin transaction. Once the channel is open (1 bitcoin TX) you can make many lightning transactions, to claim the BTC from a lightning channel on Bitcoin you need to make a second on chain transaction to close the channel. However between those two on chain transactions you can make thousands of lightning transactions.

The difference between a frozen node (tradeblock) and one accepting invalid transactions and broadcasting them (blockchain.info) is pretty stark.

Nope, it did not. In fact there was a huge spike in hashrate shortly after the halving that occurred on November 28th, 2012. Right after the halving the next 2 (less than a few) difficulty changes were negative, and negligibly small, shortly after hashrate went through the roof. here's a picture of it for you:

Bitcoins are a truely scarce unit of account, there will never be more then about 21 million.
Central authorities of FIAT currencies are always printing more, and in fact no one knows how much is truely in existence.
If Bitcoin is successful in getting over the adoption curve you can bet that just 1 of the 21 million that will ever exist will be worth far more then current prices.
Conversely if something better replaces it, or if it outright fails due to a catostrophic bug or very contentious fork, or something else, then it will be worth far less in exchange for FIAT....

You have plenty of bandwidth to run a full node, and since you have some miners here is a fun challenge for you:
Fire up your full node and fully sync the blockchain (will take a while).
Once synched download and fire up P2Pool:

I think that after the congestion and fee market builds it is too late because of three reasons:
1. If you wait until there is lots of congestion on the network before you release the fork you loose the ability to plan it in advance. It will end up being a rushed hard fork, and is exponentially more dangerous then one planned in advance. If you plan for it now you can release the code and have the fork set to start at a time in the future, allowing (in theory) the majority of the network plenty of time to upgrade before the fork occurs.
2. If a fee market becomes established before a block size increase, and then we subsequently increase the block size, the existing fee market will fail and a new one will have to be bootstrapped all over again.
3. Bitcoin is not ready for a fee market. As the stress test showed the vast majority of wallets are not yet sophisticated enough to set their own fee dynamically based on the current congestion.

Huh? 
The only reason the hashrate would lower (which it has historically never done for more then a few difficulty increments) is because people unplug mining equipment. Miners are aware of the halving, it's not some surprise, it's priced in.
Hashrate has virtually no correlation to the halvings other then the reward decreasing, and if the system works as intended both price and total transaction fees increasing because of greater adoption, not arbitrary limits.

It depends on what side of the fork the hardware wallet back-end service is running.
For Trezor, Satoshi Labs has stated they support a block size increase to 8MB, so I'd imagine mytrezor.com will run whatever big block fork gains market share. 
For alternative Trezor services, like electrum, it will depend on what electrum does, apparently they have some work to do to support larger blocks: 
What it means for most HW wallet manufacturers (and plugin providers in the case of trezor), is that if a contentious fork happens they will need to make a choice as to which version of bitcoin to run, and that choice will affect all their customers.

I don't see it as changing the game, I see it as calling a new play by adjusting a limit that was arbitrarily put in place (via a secret hardfork incidentally) to solve a problem that no longer exists in the system. 
As far as putting peoples capital "into danger", I think it's far more dangerous and irresponsible to stand by on the sidelines with hands in pockets and allow a system to operate at near capacity when that capacity is artificially limited.

I'm not assuming anything, the OP stated:


OP assumed the lower hashrate, bitcoin dictates a lower hashrate = a lower difficulty. If the difficulty goes down existing miners (that did not unplug) make more. Lower difficulty also reduces the time to ROI for a given piece of mining hardware reducing the barrier to entry for a new miner.
And the chair analysis does not apply. Blocks are not governed by a supply and demand system like chairs. Blocks are found every 10 minutes on average, the difficulty adjusts to try to target perfect 10 minute blocks based on the network hashrate regardless of demand or space available for transactions.

False. I do not recognize or accept this to be true. This is completely counter to Bitcoin's original vision and its growth and use since the genesis block.
The first sentence of the Bitcoin whitepaper reads: 


Even the title of the whitepaper states it is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, not a settlement system. 
Side chain projects have huge potential, and are definitely needed to scale to global transaction volumes. However, we are no where near that point of adoption yet, and these technologies are a long way from being ready.
There is plenty of room currently for scaling block size. Whether it's 2MB, 8MB or some other number is unimportant. Miners will find a balance between block sizes they are willing to create and transaction fees all by themselves, they are incentivized to do so.
To argue that the Bitcoin core developers that work for Blockstream are not incentivized by the opportunity for greater profits by limiting the capacity of Bitcoin is ridiculous. I do not know any of them personally, or their actual motivations and morals, and it is also irrelevant.  
The incentive exists whether they are motivated by it or not, and cannot be discounted or swept aside as irrelevant.
Let Bitcoin grow without your artificial limitations, there is still plenty of room for glory and profit for Blockstream and the Lightning Network.

So what if Bitcoin is being speculated over? It's based on a breakthrough in computing technology and its price is still ...
So what if Bitcoin is being speculated over? It's based on a breakthrough in computing technology and its price is still being discovered. 
by Martin Rogers
"Tulips", "Ponzi scheme", "fraud", "only used by criminals and drug dealers'" have been some of the descriptions of Bitcoin in the past few weeks.
Whether or not "fake news" is driving the price, the mystique of Bitcoin is enhanced by the fact that its "true" value cannot be determined using traditional financial analytical techniques.
That mystique, however, does not justify the gulf between the bad press and what the facts show.
For instance, former ASX boss Elmer Funke Kupper's imputation that Bitcoin is "trade in drugs and other illegal products" drew instant scorn from Marco Santori, a regulatory expert and adviser to the International Monetary Fund at Cooley, a New York law firm.
He described alleged links between bitcoin and criminal activity as a "demonstrably false narrative, long disproven, driven mostly by ignorance and wilful blindness, held by financial intermediaries losing their grasp on the market".
It was nine years ago last week that "Satoshi Nakamoto" (the nom de plume of an unknown author) published a breakthrough paper in titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
The invention came immediately on the back of the collapse of Lehman Brothers during the global financial crisis.
The Bitcoin breakthrough
Bitcoin was a breakthrough in computer science: it built on 40 years of research in cryptography by tens of thousands of researchers around the world.
It combined the speed of the internet to enable global, fast, real-time transactions in a practical way by solving a computer science problem called the Byzantine Generals' Problem.
This, in effect, allowed for trust between different parties over an untrusted network such as different banks or the internet.
Critically, it removed any need for a trusted "middle man" such as a central bank, government, or clearing house. Instead, trust was created through what is called a Blockchain, the decentralised system that underpins the invention of Bitcoin
Adrian Przelozny, CEO of Independent Reserve, one of Australia's trusted Bitcoin exchanges explains it like this: "The existing payment networks are not built for the internet age. There was $500m worth of credit card fraud in 2015 in Australia alone , the brunt of which had to be borne by merchants. Bitcoin is a payment system designed for the online world, removing the burden of fraud and chargebacks from online merchant."
Real-time transfers
For the average user this means value transfers in real-time and without expensive transaction fees. Transferring money online can be done in a way that the user knows is safe and secure, and the legitimacy of the transfer can't be challenged.
The enormous promise of cryptocurrencies as a catalyst to reshape payment systems in the internet era should not be underestimated.
"Bitcoin is by consensus the most secure computer network ever developed," says Professor David L. Yermack, chairman of the finance department at New York University's Stern School of Business
"Many financial institutions have recognised that blockchains are potential conduits for many assets, including digital currency, shares of stock, real estate titles, and the like. Rather than constructing a blockchain from scratch, one might use an existing blockchain as the infrastructure upon which new markets can be layered."
Billions of dollars of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are now being traded on exchanges everyday. Many exchanges charge a small transaction fee and allow for a conversion of fiat currency ($A, $US) to cryptocurrency.
Japan made Bitcoin a legal tender earlier in this year. Japanese banks became backers of this economy and have made investments in exchanges. Since this time the volumes on global currency exchanges have increased 12-fold.
Australia stopped double taxing crypto currencies as assets from 1st July this year. Craving legitimacy, a set of cryptocurrency exchanges have proactively worked with regulatory agency AUSTRAC so they can be reporting institutions.
Institutional money is starting to come in
When a Bitcoin exchange requests Know-Your-Customer/Anti Money Laundering information from a customer, this information can be matched to the public blockchain.
The blockchain then keeps a digital record of every transaction forever. Thus, Bitcoin transfers are considerably easier for law enforcement to trace compared to cash from an ATM, gold or diamonds.
In addition, the New York Stock Exchange became a cornerstone investor in a large US exchange Coinbase and CME announced that it is launching a futures market in Bitcoin.
Institutional money is just starting to come in and a positive networking effect of tens of millions of new Bitcoin users is currently gaining momentum.
Admittedly, overall numbers of Bitcoin users are still small, but they are growing quickly as ease of use for all participants is rapidly increasing. And it is true that the price of Bitcoin today is likely more driven by speculation than actual payment volume.
But this is not necessarily a case of Tulipmania. Speculation is a natural – and some would say necessary – part of the process of price discovery.
Daily currency exchange volume is $5 trillion. Bitcoin's typical volume is still $5 only billion, suggesting that we are still in the infancy of Bitcoin.
There are economists and business leaders who are deeply skeptical of Bitcoin. Perhaps the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin as a daily method for payment wont work, but there will be no doubt a cryptocurrency or a set of cryptocurrencies that we will be making payments with in the future.

I'm not sure how this would help, other then to protect your nodes memory and exclude yourself from the rest of the network.
A min TX fee of over $1 is outrageous!
This flood of transactions is being gobbled up by miners, we will happily take the .0002 tx fees all day long (about $0.05 per tx).... 
That's about $100 in TX fees per fullish(TM) block by current price, on top of the 25 BTC block reward....
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:04:09
I'm not sure how electrum handles, but the Bitcoin RPC has an estimate fee endpoint: 
"Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin confirmation within nblocks blocks."
"nblocks" is the number of blocks you would like the transaction to confirm in.
1 Block:  0.00026809
2 Blocks: 0.00015142
3 Blocks: 0.00010369
5 Blocks: 0.00001881

Here's 2 more...
1. If a fee market becomes established before a block size increase, and then we subsequently increase the block size, the existing fee market will fail and a new one will have to be bootstrapped all over again.
2. Bitcoin is not ready for a fee market. As the stress test showed the vast majority of wallets are not yet sophisticated enough to set their own fee.

I'm not sure DBMS is the best analogy but I'd assume you would agree that a DBMS without basic CRUD functionality is not a solution to a problem that requires a DBMS.
There are numerous technical hurdles to overcome before LN can even be considered a usable solution. IMO the largest current hurdle is decentralized routing, until that is solved LN can not be considered anything but a centralized solution. 
I'd like to believe they will get there, and I hope they do, but no one knows when it will happen. It certainly does appear that fully functional LN is at best years out.

**Google Trends did not prove to be a good predictor**
“A group of researchers at Wellesley College examined data from Google Trends and analyzed how effective a tool it could be in predicting U.S. Congressional elections in 2008 and 2010. In highly contested races where data for both candidates were available, the data successfully predicted the outcome in 33.3% of cases in 2008 and 39% in 2010. The authors conclude that, compared to the traditional methods of election forecasting, incumbency and New York Times polls, and even in comparison with random chance, Google Trends did not prove to be a good predictor of either the 2008 or 2010 elections.[31] Another group has also explored possible implications for financial markets and suggested possible ways to combine insights from Google Trends with other concepts in technical analysis.[32]“

Agreed. Bitcoin price has reached parity with gold price would be a better title.
A random site I found says there are 5,820,203,717 ounces of gold above ground, how much is below ground is unknown, and mining production could potentially vary greatly.
~16.2 million Bitcoin are "above ground", with a hard cap of 21 million and a pre-determined rate of mining.
Given that it has reached gold price parity in a relatively short time, and has a much more limited supply; is it not logical to conclude that it may reach gold market cap parity in the future?
I know your not disputing it may, but I'm a glass half full kind of hodler ;)

Thx for the reply.
I think his main point for "LN does not yet exist" is that it still faces many development challenges which have yet to be solved (I'd argue routing is the current biggest), and that it will take a great deal of time for those issues to be figured out. Because of this, LN is not a solution to our current transaction bottleneck.
Blockstream has argued that by creating this bottleneck it will speed development and adoption of solutions like LN, but my question is at what cost? I believe this road will stall adoption, perhaps setting us back years, perhaps worse...
Another major argument that you did not address is that the centralization of LN hubs will create KYC/AML requirements for LN. I think it's a valid point, and one that could stop LN in it's tracks.


Obviously no one knows how LN regulation would play out, but I think this is a serious concern.

Inside a metal shed in the Tibetan highlands of western China, thousands of microprocessors flank narrow corridors, generating a constant hum and stifling waves of heat.
Outside, the sky is clear and blue, with a mountain peak looming at the top of a narrow wooded valley. A flock of goats ambles idly past a pile of discarded foam packaging. Inside, though, tranquility is transformed into clamor. Red, blue and green lights constantly flash; cooling water trickles down the walls, and large ventilation fans thrum as they struggle to shift the hot air produced by all this concentrated computing power.
This is a bitcoin “mine,” the engine room of the world’s leading digital currency. The microprocessors here approve and record all the transactions that keep the bitcoin system running. They also compete to solve complex mathematical problems and are rewarded with bitcoins: That’s a way of putting fresh digital currency into circulation and incentivizing more people to set up “mining” operations.
Bitcoin began as a utopian, libertarian dream, a decentralized currency outside the control of governments, a system that gives its users the anonymity of cash and the instant, global power of email. This was a system built not just for convenience, but also for those who can’t bring themselves to trust the global financial system, created by a programmer whose identity remains a mystery.
Across Tibet, China is busy pulling mineral resources out of the ground; there is even a gold mine close by. But here in Kongyu, most of the mining is virtual. It is here because of extremely cheap hydropower, cheap wages — and perhaps because Chinese entrepreneurs have a knack for the business.
For a while, bitcoin was effectively kidnapped by drug dealers, becoming the anonymous payment backbone of the Silk Road, a black market in illegal drugs that flourished on the dark Net — until the FBI closed that market down in 2013.
Today it is an industry that is starting to come of age, but whose center of gravity has shifted to China, and away from utopian dreamers toward venture capitalists.
“When bitcoin was invented, the people dedicated to it were mostly crypto-punks and libertarians,” said Eric Mu, the chief marketing officer with HaoBTC, which operates the bitcoin “mine” in this township in China’s western Sichuan province. “Now they are more like bankers and lawyers who see opportunities in the industry. And as they join, the industry is changing.”
In this case, changing also means moving to China.
Today, mines run by Chinese companies account for about 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin processing power, its factories produce the cheapest microprocessors to run these mines, and its exchanges account for about 70 percent of the world’s bitcoin trade.
It is increasingly big business. Altogether there around more than 15 million bitcoin in existence: Each is worth $615 at current prices, with a market capitalization of $9.2 billion.
For some, Chinese domination of an industry once controlled by libertarian crypto-punks is a rich irony. For others, it is a more practical threat: Chinese miners, some argued, have been standing in the way of reforms needed to speed up transaction speeds on bitcoin’s fast-expanding network of users.
But those concerns might be overblown.
“Some people in the Western world were painting Chinese miners with too broad a brush,” said Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University. “It’s not the case that all Chinese miners are part of the same enterprise or are colluding.”
But Sirer identifies one risk with the concentration of mining power here: If the Chinese government wanted, it could in theory crack down on miners and force them to block certain bitcoin accounts.
“They would not be able to usurp funds, but they could stop the motion of funds,” he said, describing exactly the sort of government control bitcoin was supposed to guard against.
These are concerns that have parallels with the way China is using its digital market power to reshape the Internet and influence the global debate about censorship and surveillance.
But here, in the mountains of Sichuan, it is hard to see much evidence of a Chinese plot to bring bitcoin to heel.
The Chinese government has employed a fairly light touch. Although it banned banks from taking part in bitcoin trading in 2013, it left ordinary people free to buy and trade the crypto-currency, and miners free to operate.
The industry is run by a disparate mix of investors and dreamers and is manned by electricians and IT experts. There are people like Ryan Xu, an infectiously enthusiastic Chinese-born Australian who first became interested in libertarian economics while working as a reactor operator in a nuclear power plant. He now describes himself as “both a utopian and a venture capitalist.”
“We need to foresee the next five or 10 years,” he said in a wide-ranging conversation over dinner in the western city of Kangding. “All the governments are printing money and diluting people’s wealth. Is that justice or robbery? The financial system also keeps crashing every five or 10 years. I think that’s an illness in the monetary system and it needs a cure.”
He says he is not sure bitcoin is the answer, but it is at least an experiment that might work.
So why China?
Running microprocessors sucks electricity. Competition is intense, and profit margins are narrow: Xu has moved his mines around the world in search of the cheapest power, from Iceland to Georgia, and then to Washington state, from the coal fields of China’s northern Inner Mongolia province and now to the mountains of Sichuan.
His latest mine is still under construction, between a hydroelectric power plant and the concrete shell of a disused power transmission station, between Kongyu and the city of Kangding.
As China’s economy boomed, private companies set up hydroelectric plants in western Sichuan; then, as the economy slowed, they found themselves unable to sell to the national grid, elbowed out of the market by more politically powerful state-owned firms.
“It took a lot of money to build the plants, but it doesn’t cost that much to maintain them,” said HaoBTC’s Mu. “So it makes sense for them to sell the power to anyone willing to buy, even at a low rate.”
Maintenance staffers are cheaper here than in the West. Mu says his company employs 10 people at three mines in the mountains, paying them around 6,000 yuan ($900) a month, a “decent salary” for this part of the world. HaoBTC runs one other mine in Sichuan and one farther west in Xinjiang, with more than 11,000 machines, earning more than 80 bitcoin a day — a daily income stream worth more than $745,000.
But it is not only Chinese entrepreneurs who have taken to bitcoin. Deprived of good investment opportunities at home, and burned by a volatile stock market, a growing number of Chinese people have begun speculating and investing in bitcoin.
Bobby Lee, a former Silicon Valley engineer who founded China’s first bitcoin exchange, BTCC, attributes it partly to a natural instinct to buy and sell.
“If you look at Las Vegas or Macau or casinos worldwide, how come most of the clientele are of Asian descent, or Chinese specifically?” he asked. “It has to do with some cultural instinct. Chinese people like to gamble.”
Yet as bitcoin matures, it is also experiencing some significant growing pains.
On Aug. 2, the Bitfinex exchange in Hong Kong was forced to admit that hackers had stolen nearly 120,000 bitcoin worth $72 million from customers’ accounts. That news caused the bitcoin price to fall by more than 20 percent and underlined the safety concerns that many ordinary people feel about owning digital money.
At the same time, the system is showing signs of overloading. Bitcoin’s current technology can process only around three digital transactions a second — minuscule compared with the roughly 24,000 transactions per second that Visa can manage.
Delays in processing transactions have grown, as have transaction fees, and the industry has become deeply divided about how to reform the system to solve the problem.
Jeff Garzik, a leading bitcoin developer based in Atlanta, argues that a technological fix is in the pipeline that soon will allow bitcoin to process tens of thousands of transactions a second.
“I think that with new technologies coming down the pipeline, it can scale up to everyone buying their coffee with bitcoin in the entire world,” he said. “It really can be the first really good substitute for physical in-your-hand cash.”
Like Sirer, he isn’t too worried about the current concentration of mining power in China, partly because the market is so dynamic and the dominant players change every year.
“It’s much easier to challenge the dominant players in this space because market entry is so easy,” he said. “If the Chinese miners suddenly power off their rigs, within 24 hours we’ll see the emergence of another competitor.”
Here in the mountains, miners while away their free time playing mah-jongg or poker, smoking cigarettes or surfing on their smartphones. Site manager Guo Hua used to run a small camera-repair shop and still likes fiddling around with machines. Marketing manager Mu, who spends only a few weeks of the year here, likes to translate books in his free time or run to the nearest town to buy cigarettes for his colleagues. Sometimes he hikes into the mountains, toward a remote Tibetan village or a looming peak, a welcome change of change of pace from Beijing and its polluted air.
And all the time, the microprocessors keep on running.

You can’t mine Bitcoin profitably under any circumstances with graphics cards. You can mine a scrypt alt-coin and convert it, but that’s not the same thing.
Bitcoin is mined with specialized chips that serve literally no other purpose, they are call application specific integrated circuits or ASICs.

Thank you. Just to clarify, the original code base did not contain RBF, but a means of replacing an older unconfirmed transaction with a new transaction with no fee requirement (you could even reduce the fee of the original transaction). This was exploited and disabled. Later Peter Todd fixed the exploit by including a requirement for a higher fee.

Rather then complain about this implementation, I figured I'd suggest what I'd like to see in an exchange/HW wallet pairing:
- Login w/ trezor
- An exchange wallet with 2-of-3 multisig: Bitstamp holds 1 key, Customer holds 1 key, trusted 3rd party holds one key (like Third Key Solutions)
- All trades and withdrawals must be signed by customer and bitstamp
- In the event of bitstamps dissolution 3rd party and customer sign to return funds to customer
The first exchange that does this will be the first to be truly hacker-proof and allow customers to retain control of their own funds even on the exchange.
The only downside I see is the increased bitcoin transaction fees that will be paid on each exchange transaction, for me it would be a small price to pay for the piece of mind.

As the provider of the primary source of data for P2Pool miners ( the owner of p2pool.org, and someone who has been active with the P2Pool community for a while I would love to hear how 21 Inc. plans to roll out "P2Pool v2".
P2Pool's biggest strength is it's open source, trust-less and decentralized nature, preserving those traits should be the number 1 priority.
Other large operations (Bitmain Tech) have claimed to be rolling out a new version of P2Pool in the past, but as it turned out they just wanted to capitalize on the good will associated with P2Pool's name for their marketing message while continuing to run a closed, centralized mining pool. I certainly hope that is not the case with 21 Inc.
P2Pool is simply awesome, and I'd like as much as anyone to see it continue to grow, however there are some real challenges that need to be solved for it to be a decentralized, trust-less solution for miners around the world. Some pretty smart folks have been thinking about that problems for a while and the solution has yet to be discovered/invented.
I look forward to hearing Balaji's plan to address those problems.

The only honest answer is no one knows, the protocol is not even fully specified yet and there are still challenging unsolved problems to overcome before folks can start to build lightning enabled services for consumers.

@_date: 2015-11-25 19:33:10
This has been suggested by Forrest, P2Pool's creator as a potential way to deal with the scalability of the pool, and as Peter mentioned is not hard to implement. 
The challenge lies in distributing the hash rate between the various versions of the share chain, or "shards" as Peter called them.
Miners will always be drawn to the shard with the largest hash rate as it will have lower variance. It's essentially the same problem that has caused the centralization to large pools, except the centralization will be towards a shard.
A method to automatically and fairly "balance" the hash rate between multiple "shards" would need to be developed. 
Even then, by dividing the P2Pool hash power between independent shards, you will also increase the variance of each shard to a level not acceptable to most miners.

@_date: 2015-11-25 15:43:52
Not in P2Pool's current form. P2Pool uses a share chain, similar to bitcoin's block chain, except that instead of transactions the share chain tracks shares that are paid out in BTC when the pool finds the next block. The shares are paid directly to the miners address in the generation transaction. 
Here is an example: 
In this case the shares that were paid were spit between 237 miners on P2Pool, each of whom had at least 1 valid share in the share chain.
This share chain currently includes a maximum of 8,640 valid shares that are paid when a block is found. Therefore a theoretical maximum of 8,640 miners can be paid per found block, in practice (as shown above) the number of paid miners is far less.
TLDR: Because miners are paid in a trust-less manner, directly from the generation transaction, no one ever has custody of the coin except the miner who held the shares. This limits the number of miners that can be paid, the more miners on the pool, the higher the share difficulty, the less likely it is a given miner will find a share, and variance increases to the point where if everyone mined on P2Pool it is the same as solo mining.
@_date: 2016-10-15 01:44:37
Yea, it's a pool based on the exact same principles as bitcoin, requiring no trust and completely transparent. Do hope to attract some new miners as our share difficulty is relatively low and as the visualization shows we have a solid decentralized node network with an active dedicated group of miners.

Thats not really the problem I see, and I totally share your frustration with stalled development right now. Forks, soft or hard, that have wide consensus have and will continue to occur with no great disruption to Bitcoin. 
The problem I'm concerned about is that with UASFs the "user" part is easily faked, making it very difficult for actual "users" to agree on what change should be made, AND on which fork the real economic value is...
Is the value on the sybil attacked UASF chain with 10,000 nodes, or is it on the chain with 500 nodes? How do I tell? Hashrate? Thats how it works now...
Maybe the exchanges will be forced to collude and decide where the value is?
Perhaps it remains the miners who end up having to all agree on what chain to secure?
Bottom line I guess it that as far as I can tell UASFs (if successful) break the proof-of-work (and all its related game theory) that is a large part of the foundation that makes Bitcoin work.

I believe for example that the Trezor code has been fully vetted. Having owned one for a while I have seen bugs identified, reported to the Trezor team, and fixed. 
White hat hacker JoHoe (sp?) who discovered the RNG flaw, ~~stole~~ saved, and returned the coins from bc.info reported a unrelated bug to the Trezor team which was rapidly fixed. Then they hired him full time.
Even I reported a bug early on (non-critical) where Trezor would try to include freshly mined Bitcoins when sending a transaction before they were spendable (generated coins require 100 confirmations before they can be spent). I reported it, and it was fixed within hours.
And, even if you believe the source was not fully vetted by good actors, you better believe it's been scoured for security flaws by bad actors....

Actually BIP 9 has worked in practice for non-contentious forks, CSV was activated smoothly.
My biggest issue with UASF is that nodes are easily created without great expense. We have seen node signaling sybil attacks before, and if UASFs were to gain any influence on the protocol I'm sure we would see many more...
Imagine a future where whoever controls the largest sybil attack controls Bitcoin. I'm sure you can quickly grasp how easy it would be to manipulate the protocol for nefarious purposes. 
Until there is a method to **count noses instead of nodes** UASF is easily manipulated.
If this is inaccurate, please explain why...

I think that changing the PoW, which is what gives bitcoin literally ALL of its immutability, is something that would need to be approached very carefully.
How would you roll out a PoW change?
How many algorithms could even be considered? What if as a bad actor I took a gamble on what one of the next PoW's would be and secretly developed an ASIC before it even became the new PoW? Wow, that could be disastrous...
Edit: I think it would be easier to decentralize mining through commoditizing user owned and run hardware than to change PoW.

Its unfortunate that people still use the word spam. Spam does not exist in Bitcoin. Transactions are either valid or not, there is no spam. 
I think it's even more unfortunate that this artificial fee market has been allowed to to bootstrap, and that now thousands of UTXOs are completely unspendable because they are less than the fee required to spend them, and will remain on every node (not just full nodes) forever.

There is a huge logical fallacy in this kind of thinking. As a miner I don't want a limited capacity at all, I want the whole world to transact in bitcoin, all the time, every transaction. Forget coffee, I want the penny candy store to accept BTC for a single piece of candy.
While this is not technically possible today without off-chain solutions, there is certainly room to increase the blocksize without the sky falling.
Miners know that more transactions = more fees/adoption/revenue. Miners did not ask for this fee market to be bootstrapped early, in fact just the opposite.

Agreed, its the most simple and elegant solution to prevent this "debate" (I use the word lightly) from occurring in the future. It's the when and how that has everyone in knots... When=asap, how=adaptive block size?

You can broadcast transactions from many places. If they are valid or not is another question.

There is zero evidence for correlation between government shutdowns and bitcoin price.

Our index (and how it is calculated) is up and running as usual ;)

And while they do sell “stuff” last time I checked there were no houses for sale on amazon...

As a HODLer I'd argue it's the other way around:


If you cant HODL through the dips you will never make it to the promised land :)
Also it's little 'b' when talking about the currency, and big 'B' when talking about the protocol...
Still, cool shirt.

Thanks Pamela, good to know.

Excellent question.

There is a single mention of Bitcoin on the TaxAct site, just 1. 
It is in regrades to the IRS guidance published in March 2014.
There is no mention anywhere else of bitcoin.

Last time I checked it was all open source, so everyone...

I miss his stuff, he is a great educator. Perhaps one day he will re-join the community.

BIP149 does seem more reasonable, hopefully some of the other work going on now will be rolled out before July 2018.

Actually, while you may be fucked in many other ways, bitcoin stored on your Trezor can not be stolen by someone with access to your machine. They would be able to keylog your password, but the pin would remain private, along with the private keys which never leave the device.

Doubt it. Lot of noise from sock puppets, no real economic activity represented by UASF

Dude, thats just plain wrong... man. HODL originated from a druken post on BitCoinTalk as a typo, it's a verb, man... Come on!

1. Is being worked out on github as we speak
2. Already addressed and fixed
3. Not sure what you mean by "custom" software, but plenty of core devs reviewing and contributing to the code.
4. Bullshit, plenty of changes have been made to the protocol with miner support.

This. End the vicious FUD.
