I can't agree with you more. Some people are so damn skeptical over shit that doesn't matter.

It's on paper...

You would have to have some beefy security because there's no way in hell you'll get FDIC insurance.

Oh right. Let me get my shotgun and lynch too!

The Nexus 5 is nice, I'm very happy with it. LTE works extremely well on it (I'm on Sprint) .

It's a currency without a government backing. The government takes no part in or of it. You don't have to say shit to the Feds.

You put $20 in your tank and get gas if you need it later on. If you have a credit or debit card you can just use that at the pump. You can also give the cashier $50 or $60 to prepay. What you don't use you can come back inside and get.

It'll take some time to get everything situated.

This website never loads for me... No matter what ISP I seem to be on.

In my area it's NCR running Radiant POS on top of Windows or IBM using a wide array of different software also running on top of Windows. PacSun uses Travado, Big Lots uses something custom I believe, I don't know about the others.

Enjoy your new found freedom. :)

So? Use Sprint, T-Mobile, or AT&amp;T. I personally recommend Sprint.

There should be no reason to if you're using bitcoin. It would just require transferring back the difference. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 09:00:07
Woooo! I'll have another use for the tiny bit of Bitcoin I have! 
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:36:14
That's what you have to deal with if you use cash.

Pay your debt off. Secure yourself for the unknown.

True, Bitcoin ATMs are common enough for it to be easy and cheap at least around here.

It does manage to get there the quickest though. But an advertisement is still an advertisement.

ADHD is never having anything that stimulates you, never being able to focus on anything, and having a terrible time ever being successful. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 02:33:48
Exactly, there's never enough stimulation. Nothing can keep you focused and you focus on everything. I can listen to multiple conversations at once without much issue. The only time I can't is if I'm really into what I'm preoccupied by.

I wish you understood what your where bullshiting about. The medication us the only way I can get anything done or be on time for anything. Time management is one of the hardest things to get a hold on.

The permits seem to cost stupid amounts of money too. $120-180/year depending on the municipality.

It looks more like a smaller piece of paper on top of a larger piece of paper. Paper comes in different levels of whiteness.

Most cities require a permit. Sadly...
