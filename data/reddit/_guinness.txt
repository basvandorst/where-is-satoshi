Be very careful with NewEgg. They sent me the wrong ram once. Not only that, but it was all busted. $700 worth to be exact. I paid via PayPal. I requested a refund and return to which they flat out denied. No reason. Just said nope. 
I then opened a case with PayPal. They fought it. Fortunately I was able to prove that what they sold me was different from the photos and model numbers on their website. 
In fact I found that all of their RAM was mislabeled. Their photos didn't match what they were selling for tons of RAM types they were selling. 
I gave PayPal this info and they sided with me. Boom. I forced the return. 
But newegg still played games. I shipped the RAM back and unfortunately my tracking info never updated. USPS claimed they never delivered it so Newegg claimed they never got it. 
Fortunately some nice employee there mailed my RAM back to me (took it out of my package put it in a newegg box and sent it back to me, so it wasn't USPS)
So I reopened the case and gave proof that newegg lied and did in fact receive it because here are photos of the package and tracking number. 
So PayPal let me send it to them yet again. This time I paid for FedEx because they tend to be better. FedEx delivered the item and tracking info was updated. This satisfying Paypals proof of my return. I finally got my funds. 
But no it didn't stop there. Newegg couldn't just let it go. They banned me as a customer. I don't know why. I have shopped at newegg for years and I think prior to this I returned maybe one item for $50 or so out of roughly 5k min of orders from them. 
I just dunno what the fuck happened. They really went after me for no reason. I've worked in IT for 17 years so I know how to build computers. 
That was my last Newegg purchase. After that they implemented bitcoin. Had I paid with it, I never would have gotten my money back and I'd be stuck with $700 worth of busted ass RAM.
