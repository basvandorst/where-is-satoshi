A billion dollar company is probably in the process of doing both. What happened to him is that his company was very successful very fast. People act like that's some normal adaptation that any sane, well educated entrepreneur should be able to make. It isn't. The failure (or at least the firing of the founder) of thousands upon thousands of companies is testament to the fact that massive, rapid scaling isn't easy.

Brilliant. Thanks for sharing this. I’m a big fan of Watts but don’t remember this passage. As someone whose understanding of money and whose psychological relationship to it is only just now starting to mature beyond that of a 6 year old, I appreciate thinkers who can talk about money from angles other than mere numbers. Crypto has been a boon for me since the technological layer acts as a kind of protective layer for my psyche and I don’t get the same “OMG IM HORRIBLE WITH MONEY” anxiety when I think about it. I’m able to think rationally about currency and how to manage it without breaking out into hives every time it comes up.

In the sheeple’s defense, bitcoin doesn’t have a simple metaphor that people can wrap their heads around. The “dollar” is a simplified metaphor for the complex system of exchange underpinning it.

Well that sure seems like a barrier to adoption if my buyer has to report every unique instance of spending as a capital gain. Is there a tax code you're referring to when you say this? I mean, I'm not selling weed here, I sell art... I'd like to be able to take bitcoin, but my potential buyers are basically 0 if they have to report each transaction as capital gain. The income on my part seems sort of rational and theoretically wouldn't be hard to compute... this just seems like madness to me to even try to accept btc in a p2p fashion.

I think too broad of a brush is being used here. Left leaning politics can include things like: “I don’t think government should have the power to prevent consenting adults from marrying, I don’t think government should tell a woman what she should do with her body (abortion). I don’t think police should have unlimited, unchecked power over people. I don’t think the military should have a blank check. I don’t think the government should be allowed to abandon those who served their country to poverty, mental illness, and PTSD. I don’t think the government should be allowed to spend money in opaque ways or create more simply because they want more. If the dollar were pegged to bitcoin and all govt spending were on a blockchain, we could see whether politicians are spending the tax dollars that left-leaning citizens are willing to pay in the way they’re supposed to.” 
For those who would say that leftist politics is about “more government” I would encourage you to watch something other than Fox News.

Well, technically yes. I pay my credit card bill off IMMEDIATELY because I don't want to rob Peter to pay Paul as they say. You can sell  portions of your bitcoin back to your bank account from Coinbase but: 
1. they charge a decent fee for that transfer
2. It can take 2-3 weeks sometimes. 
Don't buy more than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is notorious for losing 20-30% over night. If you're going to panic and sell when that happens then you should think about investing in something less volatile. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:15:53
Here's what most are doing: download the Coinbase app, hook up your credit card, buy a tiny bit, refresh the app like 600 times a day, buy a little more once you realize the value is going up (generally...the dips are kind of fun too). Rinse and repeat until you have lots of bitcoin and not enough dollars.

I’m sorry no one is answering you in a reasonable tone. Some folks are into bitcoin because it makes them feel smart that they understand it and others don’t. The responses you see here are evidence of that. Bitcoin’s complexity and the lack of simplified terms, metaphorical analogies, and lack of kindness in communities like this are an ENORMOUS barrier to adoption. Hopefully the second and third layer technologies will continually get easier for the layperson in the same way that everything about the internet has gotten easier for the layperson. There is 100% a need in my opinion for easier-to-use and more robust wallets. They’re likely coming since I can only imagine what the help desks are like at Trezor and Ledger. Imagine the number of people who are losing money simply because the system is complex. 
I’m sorry nearly everyone here has been a neckbearded wallstreetbet dick. You asked a good question.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:46:35
The question is how much bitcoin you’ll have. If you have 1/2 a coin you have 1/2 a coin. $500 will buy ~1/16 of a coin now but when a bitcoin is worth 20k, $500 will only get you 1/40th of a coin. There’s a chance that you may never be able to own a whole coin if the fiat value outstrips the pace at which you can buy it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:40:46

I accidentally didn’t include the link. Why are you swearing at me? Some of the folks in this sub are so self righteously indignant. I’ve been a crypto supporter/owner for a long time...maybe try not to be a douche. Be kind. Be friendly. It’s good for the entire community. Someone else posted the SAME article a few hours before I did (which I didn’t see) and it got some conversation going... I’m sure you feel better believing you’ve been “protective” of this sub.

Thank you for the /s.

What peer reviewed economic papers are you reading? Love to see them. Please share!

I’d like to see taxes collected in the form of bitcoin. And the govt should have to share its addresses for the sake of transparency of their own budgets.

Interesting article. Not from a peer reviewed journal however.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:39:55
Normally I’d preface a comment with IMO. I was just being lazy. And I use downvotes as a way to say “I disagree” not necessarily to say “you suck”. We’re cool, man. No harm no foul.

That’s great that you made money! Personally, I like the amount of coin I have. I’m less interested in cashing out for fiat and more interested in accumulating more coin. Different goals. 
It’s clear that these exchange markets are really susceptible to feeding frenzies and then taking huge dumps afterward.  For those who are trying to accumulate more coin as a long term goal however, it makes more sense to dca over long periods of time. If you’re looking to cash out for fiat, then identifying bubbles before they pop is hugely rewarding!

That’s going to be the tricky part for some...when to pull out.

Because I’m allowed to make assumptions about people. And I alluded to that by saying “if”.

The real breakout will happen sometime in 2021, 12-18 months after the next halving. Everything between now and then is just breaks in the sidewalk. We’re not even ON the rollercoaster yet.

I’m sorry you’re getting downvoted here. It’s very true. So much in the bitcoin ecosystem needs simplified user layers. Think of pre-browser Internet use vs the post-browser adoption curve. And the use of a device like the mouse. And clickable icons... a LOT needs to be done before average joes can actually secure their own coin.

Lol. What do you use to determine when to buy and sell if you’re trading? Animal bones? The fact is that something is guiding when ANYONE trades: intuition, news/rumors, tea leaves, log charts, models based on everything from stock-to-flow to google search trends. We’re ALL crazy and making wagers on what the future holds. Some around here are super crazy and imagining a future where converting to fiat isn’t necessary at all. Maybe most countries will eventually peg their currency to bitcoin. I don’t KNOW the future. I’m guessing based on all kinds of bullshit just like the rest of us.
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:56:22
Wut? Let me rephrase: for those who are in it as believers rather than trying to make a quick buck, have you ever been tempted by the fiat? If so, how hard was it to resist the temptation?
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:20:22
I mean, you do what you have to do.

His timeline is a little off “we may estimate that adoption will be ubiquitous in approximately three years” (from 8 years ago) but the heart of the matter is still the same. Thanks for the recommended read.

Smart women buy their own cars and their own bitcoin.

This just dawned on me: Once everything is mined out, what’s the incentive for anyone to run a node? Does the anti-censorship feature weaken once everything is mined?

This. It’s actually a great idea to use blockchain tech to prove that you own anything. With the number of people who falsely claim an education they didn’t get, this is a great way to verify any kind of contract (which is essentially what a diploma is).

It’s still possible to put fake data on an AWS server too.

Oh yeah, I forgot about those folks. I guess I was more wondering about those who were in a position to be tempted in the first place.

Lately this sub is full of gatekeeping, iamverybadass, lookhowsmartiam, if-I’m-the-most-critical-I’m-the-most-smartest types who are interested in feeling superior to everyone else. Lots of machismo and negativity. I don’t think that’s true of ALL bitcoiners but this sub has devolved a bit lately into an unwelcoming unfriendly space imo. Keep tending the garden though. Someone has to plant flowers. It’s much needed if there is to be wider adoption.

BAT. Skinny little ankles. A shame too because I really like the Brave browser and what they’re trying to do.

Were you TRYING to bait the trolls with this post? They certainly showed up.

I like this. Nice use of mixed media to convey a concept.
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:38:49
I'd never thought about that option... so quit the job without cashing out? Seems crazy that anyone would do that. I guess if it were more widely adopted as a form of payment... but not until then!

I miss this guy. I feel like he’s from an era when this community was friendly and funny and generally enjoyed the collective success of a good idea. I want more Magic Internet Money spirit up in this joint.

Sometimes people are trading out their alts for bitcoin, sometimes they’re trading bitcoin for an alt that’s really bumping. Usually alts and bitcoin are rising and falling in tandem with one another but when one or the other is jumping up or down unexpectedly you’ll see people trying to exit positions to make more coin in either alts or bitcoin.

You poor soul. You should think about raising your standards. If you don’t believe they exist, you’re going to miss out on a woman who’s hot AND intelligent. The second one of those gems gets a whiff of “hot women don’t have to think” she’ll discard you like a used tampon.

What do you mean by "restricting the territory" of competing ideologies?
