Looks like trapcode form for AE

1/1 good experience. Bought $200 6 months ago and it was at MetroPCS in NY. It was easy and I was told that it's not refundable by the guy at the register

You don't have to just hold if you're looking for profit. You can use 15% of it (or smaller if you want less risk) and give out loans at btcpop or a similar site. Just find A or B rated lenders that paid back a ton already so you know they have a good reputation.

.37 btc at the moment

Thank you for your suggestion. I do like the OpenBazaar option with a link to it on my site for Bitcoin customers. I think I might do it that way

Where exactly is it located? I'd love to check it out. I have some friends in NY that would love to buy them physically besides through LibertyX

I came around 2011-2012 and I believe most people were mining and some were using faucets. So I'm guessing 2009 and 2010 you probably couldn't buy them through a site, probably through a forum from other users

If you're in Hoboken NJ, there is a Bitcoin ATM right by the path train

Hey there! Doing such nice things

Damn, the tipping party is strong

Being broke

LibertyX. I did it twice in NYC and had a good experience. I think like most MetroPCS stores sell that card that you then redeem on LibertyX

thank you :)

Good colors, nice layout when looking on the phone. The slider doesn't work when I slide, but works if I tap so it's good that it's functional

I've mined on minergate and would make like $0.20-0.30 a day which wasn't bad. As long as you don't spend money to try to increase your speed, you'll be fine. I wouldn't recommend spending $400 on a card to bring up your profit by $0.20 a day. It would take forever to break even

If you watch the full video till the end, he mentions Bitcoin twice. At the very end(last 2 min) they talk about the web bot prediction and its effect on silver and Bitcoin. They say that patience will pay off to those who have money in precious metals and Bitcoin

I wish my work paid in bitcoins. I shoot weddings and work at a university
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:41:35
I've used btcjam before and it was okay. I use btcpop now and it's better and more reliable in my opinion. I only give out to A or B rated people, and usually for a short term (less than 180 days).

Out of 40 weddings I've shot, 0 of them have Bitcoin. So I wouldn't be making any money
