It was originally a typo for "holding" in a Bitcointalk post on December 18, 2013. It was quickly adopted as a variant of the Spartan HOLD!! meme.

To buy small quantities of Bitcoins, you can fill out a form like this online, make a local cash payment at a store or bank, and your btc will be sent to your existing email account.

You can go to Brainwallet.org and use the same 12-word passphrase. Try sending the 0.581 BTC to your friend there. IIRC this is a side effect of the new guideline that doesn't allow tiny 'dust' outputs into the blockchain. Your transaction included a transfer of zero bitcoins to another address, which is a bug in Carbon Wallet. CW will fix this soon.

Apparently the idea is that on large transactions, the clients would be rewritten to pick inputs that leave larger change amounts, or (plan b) to donate the uBTC as a fee.

If a casino has $1M in BTC and I bring in $10k worth of stolen BTC to play, all the money is now 1% 'dirty'. Ditto for a money laundry. It boils down to the problem that bitcoins don't have serial numbers, and as they pass through many hands the 'taint' gets watered down. It's considered inappropriate to nag honest people for having BTC that is only partly stolen. That said, some of the exchanges have frozen BTC that was too obviously stolen.
Here is a chart of where some of the stolen Linode money went:  --

Most wallet programs completely drain the original address when you spend. Some wallets have a "don't use change addresses" option, which makes the wallet save the change back into the same starting address.

Aha, the smallest fee Electrum will tolerate is 0.0001 BTC. (I tried 0.00009 and got the error.) I just sent this to myself and the blockchain is confirming it OK --

But if you're just trying to accept payment in bitcoins, you may want to use an existing payment processor plugin instead of trying to cobble something together.

Once an output gets sent to an address, it starts accumulating 'bitcoin days'. 1/30th of a bitcoin takes a month to accumulate one bitcoin day, which a 24 BTC transaction accumulates in an hour. It's a measure of staleness / non-volatility. In round numbers, any payment that's been in your wallet long enough to accumulate one bitcoin day is exempt from fees. If you keep moving tiny amounts over and over, they're charged a fee due to rate-limiting, even if they're above 0.01 BTC. "Bitcoin days destroyed" is used as an estimate of real transaction volume.
