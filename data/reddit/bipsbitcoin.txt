Hello, could this be of use ? 
By accepting bitcoin, be that online or brick and mortar store, you don't pay any fees to uphold a [BIPS]( account or monthly fees for having it. You don't even pay merchant processing fees; and can have the bitcoin from sales converted instantly and bank wired to more than 160 currencies in any part of the world.
Also you won't have to buy an expensive terminal to accept it, here I am thinking credit cards. Any tablet, smartphone etc. will work. And using that system I posted an image to, each one of your staff can have their own app, so you can keep track of sales and more.
By jumping on the bandwagon, I'll say you have done yours, and the bitcoin community will love you for it, even though not many will purchase with Bitcoin, Yet!

Indeed. Think of it this way. You want to send money to your family far, far away. If you were to do it with bitcoin, there would be no need to "send" it as the "money" is already there. You would simply need to get your family to exchange it to fiat "down there".
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:25:24
Yes, there is really nothing to lose by accepting Bitcoin, that's the beauty of it. And as already said, you can convert it instantly to any local currency, and receive a wire transfer at the end of the day.

As with everything else, secure it as much as possible, preferred using EV SSL to prevent eavesdropping as much as possible.
For the official app utilizing this concept, the idea is the lock the payment information for 5 minutes or less on the receiver (payment device). So that other “Chirps” can not interfere with what is already received. 
Of cause with an manually reset button, if everything goes haywire.

In regards to this,
@_date: 2013-10-13 08:33:51
And this is the reason we use SSL right ? as per BIPS integration, the generation of the sound identifier for the Bitcoin URI Scheme is done internally and using SSL for the call to “Chirp”. Hence no way of intercepting this when being generated. As "judah_mu" said and the only way I see it failing right now is "Physically proximate attacker"


So what I am getting out of this is a troll fight, and not a discussion of the idea ? You are now on about rogue access points, which has nothing to do with the original concept.
Remind me again, how this makes sense in regards to concept of security of the idea and/or BIPS ?

May I ask which browser and OS was used connecting to BIPS ?
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:00:26
Do you have any knowledge rewiring stuff? As I see it, it might be easy to hook up say a raspberry pi with RPi Serial Connection to whatever mechanism already in place for giving you the coke, when coins or bills are used.
When you can send a signal from the raspberry pi via serial connection to give you a coke, than you can install the bitcoin daemon, and on this monitor addresses for payment. I imagine simply monitoring one single generated bitcoin address.
You will probably want to have a live connection to a bitcoin market rate ticker,  so you can convert the price for a coke to whatever the customer needs to pay in bitcoin.
Than whenever your system sees a new transaction, see if it is the amount required for one coke, and if yes, send the signal to open for one coke.
The smart thing about this, is that you do not need change, but can pay the exact amount using bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:07:57
Thank you for this explanation. The personal information is required if you want to buy or sell bitcoin, or using BIPS bitcoin gateway as a merchant, as we need to adhere to KYC/AML policies.
Yes you do need an account with BIPS to pair your device to your account. However you do not need to provide these documents for using BIPS as a Bitcoin Wallet.
And yes the green box is required since we have what is called cookie law in Europe now. And BIPS user experience is not very nice on resolution lower than 640×960 also one of the reasons we now created this app.
@_date: 2013-10-07 06:20:35

I don't think this project was minded towards sales. More the possibility of developing a really good hardware device and firmware able to provide time-framed Internet access by Bitcoin payments.
**$499 is what I have to pay:**
* 1. Printed circuit board.
* 2. 1GB DDR3 1333 SODIMM Memory.
* 3. Internal Mini PCI-Express Wireless 802.11 b/g/n card.
* 4. CompactFlash card.
* 5. Industrial Chassis
* 6. Antenna.
* 7. Universal 100-240V External Power supply 60W AC Adapter.
* 8. Vertical Stand
And then of course the time used on developing the firmware (free), which I load on the device for free, and ship it out worldwide to customers.
But I agree the price is steep, and am working on getting bulk order price, but with no buffer for this project and no sponsors, it is just not possible **yet**
I tend to believe I'm doing a decent job of support. However I can just not promise support, sorry!
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:09:25

The problem is with the drivers for those specific consumer routers, I agree, they are most likely not open source, hence one would have no chance to make them work in UNIX, and customize them to support captive portal with Bitcoin payment for Internet access.

I also had my worries about this, there is also the security element to this, since the operator of a "BitcoinWifi" access point could be shady. So there might need to be some way of knowing you connected to a authentic non modified "BitcoinWifi" spot.
I am thinking checksum md5 on a locked firmware, or something. But for now HTTPS will have to do.

Very nice. How are you processing the payments ?
@_date: 2013-10-20 21:00:24

The information received in the broadcast is simple payment information, such as public bitcoin address, amount to pay in bitcoins and the label, which could be order id, invoice number, the description of "one beer" or similar, nothing that will not stand daylight if you know what I mean.
So if anyone happens to have an app open that utilizes this system and receives a “Chirp” without knowing where it came from, and decides to pay to the information received in the broadcast, there isn't really much one can do about that.
Sending less than required is handled by BIPS Mobile Checkout, so if you send a single satoshi as payment, the POS or mobile checkout page in this case will update and say pay amount minus that one satoshi you already send.
The correct client will be the one who clicks on "Send Bitcoin" on his smartphone or similar after receiving the POS device's “Chirp”, any other clients receiving this “Chirp” and clicking on "Send Bitcoin" without knowing from where it came, again there isn't really much one can do about that.
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:19:31
We had a few problems with the 15 minute invoice expiring as well when people try to pay, not from coinbase though, but other online wallets.
Why they do not send the bitcoin right away, I do not understand...
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:07:30
It will always be a battle against those who do good, vs those who don't. The operator of BitcoinWifi could block VPN, but when then? The no gooder would just route traffic over ICMP via ICMPTX (IP-over-ICMP) which is most likely the last step in trying to get unauthorized access to traffic over a closed WiFi :)

Now I cannot tell you how other online wallets work, sadly. But per your description I am guessing they hold all of the bitcoin in one single sum ?
However take [BIPS]( as an example, I can explain how your bitcoin wallet works there, if you are able to read this without seeing is as advertising.
When you create an account, as you say, you will be assigned an address (or multiple). The private key of this public key(address) will always contain the bitcoin you choose to fund to this address, since it is kept along with your other addresses in is own "account". BIPS relies heavily on the users bitcoin daemon to tell us how many bitcoins you currently have.
So for all intents and purposes the addresses you hold on BIPS is yours even though BIPS is what is called an online wallet, or hosted wallet.
This also means that you are able to use an address on BIPS for say bitcoin mining on a pool where the output is in the category of "generate" as it simply would go from "immature" to "generate" as it reaches the 100 confirmation and go straight to your own account.
With the system built this way, it also prevents us (as in the owners of the eWallet) to do fractional reserve, as this would simply mess up the system.
**The reason it was created this way, was to accommodate these kinds of concerns as they are well founded**, and also to give you more control over the ownership of your own little part of BIPS.
If you are interested in more information, I might be convinced to tell you in private. However I will not give out more information in public, as to how BIPS is built, as this is what makes BIPS special for bitcoin wallet and merchant clients.
@_date: 2013-08-27 18:53:47
**UPDATE, UPDATE**
I have found and contacted another provider of the parts I need to built the BitcoinWiFi Hotspot, and can now get the parts much cheaper!
The current price is now only $350 and everyone with an order on the old price, has been refunded the price difference!
I hope to lower this even more to around $250 or less, however this require that BitcoinWiFi receives 10 orders at a time, so I can make bulk purchasing of the parts for even lower cost.
Also I've had quite a few interested parties interested in sponsoring BitcoinWiFi, this should bring for some interesting modifications!

The merchant base in the US is a very big market right now for bitcoin, so it could be true, whereas the base in Europe is growing slowly but steady. I can report that [BIPS]( now has 1100 active merchants. It is just a matter of time before the three biggest Bitcoin Payment Processors reaches 1 million merchants each. Than I would like to say that we succeeded in what has become the future of payment systems.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:44:04

You seem mad for some reason ? I am sorry if this idea offended you in anyway... ?
Yes sending a public bitcoin key in plaintext should pose no problem as far as I'm concerned.  However this is using SSL.
You will have to explain in better details what you think the problem is.
**What do you suggest ? An attacker standing right next to the POS device and as soon as the cashier hits the checkout button, they hit checkout on their "attack device" overriding the “Chirp” from the POS device ?**

So right you are about Apple... But no I will not be using "Chirp" app at all, but making the "receiver" in HTML5 as soon as there is support for accessing the microphone. 
I do have an "hack" but this involves recording a video by file input field, and taking only the sound from this, but this is way to cumbersome.
@_date: 2013-08-25 12:45:22

Indeed, in my tests I just found it to be much faster than scanning QR codes with a phone camera.
@_date: 2013-10-13 09:16:59
It is instantly picked up by the "receiver" and prefilled in the Bitcoin address, amount and label.
@_date: 2013-10-13 09:09:49
As per discussing with the “Chirp” app is not going to be uses in production, AKA customer paying. Right now only for seeing what information is being transmitting by the “Chirp”. If you install “Chirp” it would be very cumbersome to copy the information from their app to whatever you use to send bitcoin.
I agree that using “Chirp” app would be irresponsible as it sends in cleartext.
The "receiver" will be an official BIPS app, or HTML5 webapp as soon as access is granted to the microphone in ECMAscript.
The few extra chirps in regards to this would be similar to a double spend when buying a cup of coffee.
However as I already described, using the "Chirp app" is only for displaying the information right now, the idea is based on people developing further on this concept, and integrating into their own apps.
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:54:13
It is based partly on the idea of allowing handset devices to receive payment information without that device having Camera or NFC.
In my tests I even found it to be much faster than scanning QR codes with a phone camera.
If you watch Borderless Solutions Panel from The European Bitcoin Convention - 2013 Amsterdam,
You might get the idea of where I am heading with this.
Think Feature phone.
@_date: 2013-10-13 09:57:42
NFC would beat this idea, totally agree on that point of view. However I believe that it could win over qr code in terms of time saved at the cashier. And the more customers you can expedite in a shorter period of time, the more revenue for the merchant, agree ?

The reason it says "IT SEEMS YOU ARE CONNECTING FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. BE ADVISED THERE MAY BE RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR ACCOUNT" is because there might be enforced restrictions in the future on US customers using BIPS.
Currently it is unclear what these will be but we are keeping ourselves updated on the process.
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:05:56
We are affiliated with a merchant system, and I personally think this is a really nice idea. We have now updated our Point of Sale / Mobile Checkout to support this idea.
Example point of sale:
Where as &lt;cb&gt; is the merchants public ID, URL argument ?tip=&lt;bitcoinaddress&gt; is the waitress personal public address. 
If someone could sit down and show the staff how to get their own bitcoin address, and to "boot up" their POS device with included personal tipping address, that would be very neat.
How it Works:
The bitcoins sent to the "tip" address would go directly to the pockets of the waitress, exactly like cash!
If you can see the idea in the same way as me, and feel like this is something that could be very useful out there in brick and mortar stores. You are more than welcome to apply as Individually Qualified,  so as to sign up the merchant under your account.
@_date: 2013-10-29 04:22:43
Neat!, would you be interested in making another app for our company, if I could provide you with a library in C# .NET ?
I could get you in touch with our lead developer.
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:18:32
He/her was under the impression that the "Chirp" app would be used. Hence tested the receiving part with this app, which sends everything in clear text. And this was also the part that I misunderstood in regards to his/hers security issues.
However in this case it would not make sense, since you would need to copy the "text" Bitcoin URI from the "Chirp" app to your Bitcoin app and from there click Send Bitcoin.
Once the official BIPS native app is ready, or access to the microphone is granted by the major browsers in HTML5, only imagination will be the limit of this.

Did you not write the wrong phone number ? Or was that someone else ? We are going to get back to you on Monday after this weekend.

I believe you, I developed this way of using "chirp" over the past month, and finally got it to work. The sound that is being transmitted is an identified for getting the Bitcoin URI Scheme, so as to prefill the required payment fields on your smartphone. You will need Internet to send the bitcoin none the less.
In regards to your EDIT:
There is always the possibility of simply turning down the volume on the POS device no ? And for the customer paying, quickly look over the information on his screen and compare them to the POS screen, saying "Yup that looks right" ?

Probably yes, however I don't have any experience with consumer routers, and the firmware used in these.

Do you mean for buying Bitcoin? Or receiving recurring bitcoin payments ?

**Return on investment** is not guaranteed, but if you set it up in a crowded place, one can only imagine?

Hello, could this be of use ?

Take this picture with you,
 ?
If they are going to accept Bitcoin out in the store, this might be the easiest way.
Best part ? There are no processing fees for the merchant.
This might be a good conversation starter, asking them how much they currently pay to be able to accept credit cards.

Currently yes! However you will see this message "It seems you are connecting from the united states of america. be advised there may be restrictions on your account." when signing up. This is to indicate that there might come restrictions and regulations on this as well...
US ACH is on the drawing board though.
