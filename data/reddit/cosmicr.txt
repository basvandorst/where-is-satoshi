What was the goal though?
I always thought it was intended to become a new form of currency. Instead people treat it like a commodity investment.

It's a real tragedy that her son died by overdosing on illegal drugs, but this is bad publicity for Bitcoin. She obviously doesn't understand how it works and it looking for a scapegoat.

Just a suggestion - I'd like to see the bitcoin price before I finalise my order. I tried it just now and had to go through to the final step before I could get the price in BTC.

I sea what you did there.

oops sorry. Disregard this post then :)
Strange, since both my firefox addon (which I posted it using) and reddit didn't say it was a repost. I guess I should have searched first.

The irony in having to be able to hand write a digital currency.

I liked bitcoin back then because it was seen as a potential replacement for fiat currency. Now all anyone ever does is talk about "investing" instead of actually encouraging spending and getting more places to accept it.

These are all either subjectively correct at the time or taken out of context.

Last time I checked it's an English word. 
Assuming English is not your first language, you'll find that a lot of English words have roots to other languages, mainly Latin, Greek, German.

As a beginner - I don't trust you with my email to transfer my temporary wallet to coinbase. I mean you were just able to spend on it to make the donations, how do I know you won't continue to use it after I sign up to coinbase? Where is the password stored? How did you spend with my wallet?
