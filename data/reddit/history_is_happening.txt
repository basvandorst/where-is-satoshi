Thanks for writing this down.
I'm not sure, but it seems to dislike that a full node needs longer to sync when Bitcoin grows, and you seem to dislike that the blockchain is transparent.
Good, that you don't need to verify every transaction to use Bitcoin, and good for you, that you don't need to use Bitcoin at all if you don't like the missing privacy. 
You seem to want to prohibit others to use Bitcoin the way Bitcoin is used. Again, good news: BTC does prevent users to use it too much. BCC peacefully splitted away to stop this prohibition of onchain scaling. So you can look forward to LII scaling and stop caring about Ver.

So, in short: 
- Bitwala is willing to not keep the agreement it signed.
- For Bitwala Bitcoin is what Core says. 
Even shorter:
 worshippes authority and breaks agreements
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:12:34
The idea of written agreement is that everybody keeps to the text.
There was nothing in the text about not mining another sha 256 coin. But there was all in the text about activating the 2mb hardfork.
"Good faith" has nothing to do with agreements. In fact, agreements are instrument to not need good faith, but only words.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:56:37
Sure I did.






No word of "But we only do it when Core devs are with us." Signed by Bitwala. So according to their blog they gonna break the promise they signed.

He explained it pretty reasonable with "opportunity costs". Shit, I use Bitcoin for years and it happened that I paid similarly high amounts of fees because I didn't had the time to research and wanted my tx to be confirmed fast. Real live is not scientific theory. It's time you excuse for judging Ver without knowding the full story. Step out of the bubble of 10 month of Anti-Ver-Propaganda and witch hunting.

Now again, step by step ...


You can't grow adoption if you operate at capacity limit. The price can raise, yes, but not adoption. Every high value transaction kicks a low value transaction of


SegWit makes it more complicated to estimate capacity. Since a less complicated and transparent solution is available, this is a serious critique. And no "toxic, incorrect shilling"


Numbers, math, please. When will we hit CPU limit?


I agree that we can demand investment from Bitcoin millionaires to keep the network going and that we should pay this price to let Bitcoin free the world from monetary slavery.


Cost and profit. Experience proofs that this does not happen.


Sure: Even with 1s confirmation times and zero fees Bitcoin is a very bad system to pay your allday coffee, as we already have a solution that works amazingly well - cash. Restricting the use of Bitcoin because of imaginery coffee transaction is just stupid.


Daily number of transactions. It's in the blockchain.


Other then cell phones Bitcoin started as money that was cheap to transact, has competitors (altcoins) that are cheap to transact and developed to be expensive. 


What? What? Who's the one saying that people should not pay coffee with bitcoin? You or me? Did we reach the moment of discussion where you escape in baseless ad hominem? Stay on topic. What's wrong with my interpretation of our different visions?


I can help: You basically want to stop scaling onchain because you cannot scale indefinitely onchain (I agree with this). So you don't want to cure the disease (choking transational growth) because you cannot cure the disease forever, until you discovered the magic pill that scales indefinitely. 


Ah, yes, I forgot. We did not scale cars, because we had flies, we did not scale flies, because sometimes we can beam. We did not scale hdd, because we will have ssd, we did not scale memory, we did not scale cities, we did not scale roads, we did not scale ship capacity, we did not scale size of videos, we did not scale towers, yes.

@_date: 2017-09-06 13:27:17


the solution for this is Bitcoin. You restrict it by restricting capacity.


(1) If governments / central banks really want to destroy Bitcoin as a store of value / a wealth transfer network, they will destroy exchanges and miners. Running a node over TOR cannot help you against. (2) there is a lot of space to increase blocksize without harming node diversity. But since we started our discussion you refuse to talk about the math. I provided the math about upstream - you ignored it - I asked about the math for CPU - you refused to answer.


Ever thought that this plays directly in the hands of the enemies of a pow based currency? 


What attacks? The miners?


increasing blocksize doesn't harm security.


You seem to believe that the term "Paypal" is an argument alone. This has nothing to do with PayPal. Also you use the term "security" like a religious word, as you don't explain what you mean with it / how bigger blocks harm security. 


Who are you to give me commands what to use and what to want? A police officer?  


Who are you to ...?


small blocks have nothing to do with security and wealth storage. Many people think the opposite, as Bitcoin is only a good store of wealth if it is used.


slow, clumby and expensive transfer, you mean ...


L1 does not need to be restricted, transfers do not need to be expensive and slow, to enable innovation on L2. 
It is a stupid scheme that those who want to scale L1 don't want innovation on L2. That's just propaganda. All you arguments are based on a mystical fantasy that we need to restrict the transactions of Bitcoin to create something better.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:11:05


So you are just here to make some bucks? That's ok. But stop raging against us who have the vision that Bitcoin gives monetary freedom to as many people as possible.


You raged against us stupid, toxic big blockers because we call SegWit "more complex". Now you admit this ... 




That's a complicated way to say "I don't know". 




That was not the question. You raged that we stupid, toxic, bloody big blockers talk about harddisk capacity, because you say this is not a primary issue. So what are primary issues?


Again: This is a complicated way to say: I don't know the primary issues or don't want to talk about them. Maybe because you know that your opinion is not based on facts?


He did not say this. He said: "If you are in Bitcoin since 2009, and enjoyed the monetary freedom Bitcoin gave you, and you don't want to afford a 20,000 Dollar Node, to give this freedom to other people - fuck you." And I heavily agree.


Do the math. With 1mbit you can serve 8 peers with 8mb blocks. 1mbit is extremely low today. When we need 8mb blocks there will be no place on earth with that low bandwidth.
Also: You don't want to have monetary freedom, you want to have influence. Sorry to say, but the world does not give influence for free. Not even Bitcoin.


I don't need, my mother don't need, my aunt don't need. Cash works wonderful. Stop restricting bitcoin because of imaginery adoption projection. 


Nobody will use LN when you choke adoption with the artificial transaction limit. Nobody. Do the math. It doesn't work like this.


Here we have the point. Your vision is that only rich people can use bitcoin, but all the poor can run a node and serve the rich to become more rich with Bitcoin. Our vision is that those, who became rich by bitcoin, run a node to allow rich and poor people to use Bitcoin. 


And, again: We don't need to scale to billions of users, but to the actual demand. You basically say: "Let's kill the doctors, because we can't live forever." That's stupid, not "intelligent scale".

It's about the workflow. Calling somebody a lyer because he doesn't establish a workflow to abuse his mining pool to get cheaper fees - and thus reducing the profit of miners - is hypocrite. 
really thought it is an argument that Roger has a mining pool. Instead of thinking that 1) it's expensive to establish the connection and 2) that the reduced fees equal missing mining reward, he decided to join the choir calling Roger publicly a lyer. Another proof that propaganda reduces the mental capacity of people.

Why did you ignore what I found out about CPU? Doesn't fit your narrative? 


It is not. You pretend that LN exist. But it doesn't - while Bitcoin has long reached its capacity limit.


Yes, a total shutdown will be impossible. But Bitcoin will be unusable and no longer any store of wealth. 


Spam attacks: Are more expensive with bigger blocks and do higher damage when operating at capacity limit.
"Centralization attacks": What does that mean? You seem to use the term "centralization" like a fetish.
Nationalization of miners: Has nothing to do with Blocksize. Nothing. 


Wrong under current conditions and with blocks much bigger than we have now.


What stops the communist chinese government to nationalize miners now?


Imho the risk of takeover is more by restricting L1 and driving people to centralized L2 like Liquid or Coinbase-2-Coinbase. L1 was a successfull invention against governmental control on money. L2 does not exist right now and has to proof that it can be as successful as L1.


Ah, these bad people using Bitcoin as intented. But soon your imaginery LN network will help ... LN does not exist right now and it will probably never exist as you imagine. But you complain that people are using Bitcoin right now as it was intented. 


Maybe, but not at the current capacity. We could easily have 8 or 20 mb. You did not provide any fact based reason against this.


They have plans for a malleability fix which will be done if LN is the success you imagine. Most BCH developers don't think it will happen though. They eliminated SW because it opens a spam attack vector 4 times as huge as the base blocksize and 2-4 times as huge as the real blocksize.

I discussed these pointes with you guys for two years, and whenever I raise reasonable arguments, you either stop the discussion or get ad hominem. But, anyway, let's get through this again ...


It's happening right before your eyes. Remember, at some time Bitcoin had more than 50 percent of the whole market share, right? Also, are you seriously ok with the number of daily transactions stagnating for 1 year?


If you are interested in more capacity, SegWit is way more complicated than a pure blocksize increasing hardfork. This was proofen by BCC, which immediately set 8mb blocks for every user and every wallet, while the BTC ecosystem is still struggling to even get a 1 percent increase with SegWit. Also, do you know how much capacity SegWit provides depending on the adoption rate? No? See, it is complicated.


Ok, so we agree that Disk Space is not the issue. What are the primary, secondary and tertiary issues? I always hear "This is not the issue", but whenever I try to discuss the issue, discussion stops or gets ad hominem. 


Do the math for yourself. Upstream is cheap, if you don't think running a node means to have 50 peers. I had a discussion with someone saying he can't trustlessly use Bitcoin because bandwidth. In the end I learned that he was just not able to limit number of peers. Then discussion was over, no answer again, but he kept repeating his lies.


You can run pruned nodes. If we have UTXO commitments, you never have to fully sync your node. If you use SPV (see white paper) you don't need a trusted third party. And so on. Do you really think in the long term non-business will run nodes? See Satoshi's quotes.


Only small blockers bonk on the idea that the whole world wants to pay its coffee with bitcoin. As you said, there are better ways to do (cash). But we big blockers want that it is possible to pay your coffee with bitcoin, if you need, and we are aware that one men's coffee is another men's daily income. 
As I said a hundred of times: The "coffee-attack" doesn't exist, Bitcoin doesn't need to scale to VISA-level. But it needs to scale to the actual demand - and here Bitcoin / the core devs do terribly fail.
Will you answer? Or will you be like every single other guy I discussed these topics with?

@_date: 2017-09-06 13:44:28
Ok, here we go again ... 


So you have been wronging calling this as an example for the paid-toxic-shillness of us big blockers? If so, I wait for you to say sorry.


Getting the most out of anything is what you call an experiment. It was an expensive experiment for exchanges, disturbing for the communities, made Bitcoin loose ~30 percent of cryptcoin-marketshare, cost a lot of wallet developer's time to make better fee calculators, essentially destroyed privacy enhancing things like joinmarket and mixers. The experiment was a failure, but you insist on making it permanent.


Ok, let's look at the [Bitcoin Wiki](


Does this help? It seems that CPU is not the second issue after upstream bandwidth. What is it then? If you don't find one before space, you own us big blockers an excuse.


(1) there is no demand to pay all coffee in the world. Why are you so obsessed with an imaginery demand? (2) I don't ignore SW and LN. I think SW is an overcomplicated way to achieve not so much in terms of scaling, and that LN will never be a real thing. That's not ignoring.


That's again a complicated way to diffuse the fact that the growth of daily transactions did essentially stop about 1 year ago. Meanwhile, my favorite alt, called "Iiiithiiirium" has long succeeded Bitcoin in transaction amount and Bitcoin lost 30 percent of market share.


The solution does not exist. Nobody fights against that those solutions are developed. Nobody. But restricting capacity of the original system because "Sometimes, someone will make better systems" is "choking Bitcoin's transactional growth." That's so obvious.


If LN does, fine. But why do you need to cut growth of Bitcoin transactions because of this imaginery magic pill? And why do you think I'm suffering from cognitive dissonance because I want to grow Bitcoin transactions until eventuelly this L2 thing is finished? Is it cognitive dissonance to not want monetary activity migrate to centralized, paypal-like L2 solutions, to altcoins or back to fiat? Do you really think it is cognitive dissonance to put all hopes on a solution that does not exist right now - or did you just want to use the term for another ad hominem?


Ok. Imagine at some time in history, when we had cars and trains, some core transportation developer set a quote of newly produced cars and trains - which obviously is lower than the demand for transportation - because he thinks that at some time we will be able to fly. The result would have been that we never got airplanes. Same will happen with LN when Bitcoin's growth is restricted. Core kills the demand to use Bitcoin for coffee and other &lt;$10 payments. It will go to altcoins or paypal, but for sure not wait until LN is ready (which is, as I said, probably never)


Not much sense in cherry-picking analogies. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:16:26


LN: Doesn't exit and will not exist in an economic significant way imho (happy to be proofen wrong).
SW: Was promoted as 2mb softfork, which it is not. Doesn't scale enough, increases attack surface to 4mb, makes things more complicated, increases size of transaction and so on ...


When I bought my internet connection, I got clear numbers of mbit up  / down. With SegWit even I, researching Bitcoin since three years, had trouble to estimate real capacity.
I don't say "SegWit ist soooo bad". I just say that it makes things more complicated. Without judging this. Do you agree with this?




(1) knocking on capacity limit IS an experiment in a production network. (2) you again weazel around math. What are the numbers of blocksize which would knock of a four year old $200 laptop?


Imho the coffee attack is an invention of small blockers which argue that you can't pack all the coffee payments of the world on the blockchain, and take this as a reason to not scale Bitcoin with real demand.




I talked about daily number of transactions, not daily amount of fiat. This can easily be pumped up (see the tether discussion). Why do you diffuse this? The chart of daily number of transactions is very very clear.


Can you explain this? I don't understand. Do you think you needed two transactions to transfer 1,000 dollars one year ago?


Yes, I have, and it makes me sad seeing not free bitcoin but unfree paypal 2.0 growing. This lack of freedom and autonomy is a direct result of the blocksize limit. Thanks for pointing out. 


Yes, I understand your intentions very well. But what you essentially do is NOT curing the disease - further choking Bitcoin's transactional growth - because you research a better solution. 


No, this is exactly what the choking of L1 for imaginery decentralized L2 technology does.

@_date: 2017-07-07 15:51:22


I don't compare. I just say it is a lie to say sw = 2mb. That's all.
But if you want me to compare ... 
50 percent of nodes upgrade: With SW only 50 percent of our capacity increase. With hardfork they no longer get blocks. Full capacity increase.
50 percent of wallets upgrade. With SegWit only 50 percent capacity increase. With Hardfork 100 percent capacity increase, as wallets don't care.


Would make you an altcoin. No problem. I respect this. Bitcoin is the longest chain with most difficulty. Do what you need to do.


Ok. Please be more clear about it. Usually people understand "Instant" as "instantly after SW is activated" and not as "instantly after SW is activated, I updated my UTXO and the new format is released and used by everyone I transact with." That's not how people use the term "instantly". Usually they call what you mean "at some currently unknown date after activation depending on several factors I can't control".


2.1mb is 100 percent. That will never happen. With luck we have 1.3 mb in some month.
You want to bet? Average capacity in october (in case SW activates at August and there is no 2x). I say 1.3mb, you say 2.1mb, who is closer? 






Ok, it is the opinion that a hardfork needs a very long time to activate or is impossible. It's an opinion about a hardfork. I don't agree, but it's ok to say this. But you earlier said sw is 2mb. Which is a lie. You agree?
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:37:45

First, you can have soft blocklimits at the same time as unlimited hard limits. Second, miners can "tax" transactions by fees, which stewards blockspace without a limit.






Afaik the math ends in another result. But your formula makes sense.


First, we did not talk about a hardfork. Assuming 100 percent update quote because other people called for a hardfork makes no sense. 
Second, you can't compare the contexts. A hardfork requires ONLY NODES to upgrade AND pushes them strongly to do. The SW softfork requires EVERY WALLET SOFTWARE to upgrade AND does not give them any hint they do. 
Third, if we agree that 100 percent is unrealistic, if for a soft or a hard fork - what percentage is realistic for you? And why do you advertise SegWit with numbers you KNOW are wrong, in other words: with LIES?
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:46:14
Yes, that's an immensive problems and a real obstacle for the development of good wallets. It doesn't get better with SegWit and Lightning, though ... 
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:33:48


Are you a miner? I no, you can't fill them up.


I agree. Your perspective on individual SegWit capacity increase is very interesting.


No. AFAIK just no. Last tests I heard of reached 1.5mb. Where can I access this data.


I don't care so much about my own capacity. I want Bitcoin to be more used, to serve more users and so on. And the best indicator for it is transaction capacity in mb


Even if the data I don't know and which contradicts the data I know is correct - it still is based on assumptions that can't be true. You will not get 100 percent SegWit transactions, and everybody knows this. So it is a lie.
Also it depends completely on an address format that is not even released.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:49:17


No change is also a change. Only a minority in Bitcoin wants full blocks, but they can impose it to the ecosystem. That's far worse than what you describe. What you want is a system in which an extreme minority can impede things on the majority. That's highly vulnerable to a Veto-attack blocking needed changes. 


No, you should leave and work with stones or watch stars or some other really immutable things. Bitcoin is a lot more, it is hard money, it is p2p e-cash. It is not just something resilient to change. That's my grandfather, too. If you are just here for the resiliency against change, you might find stars and galaxies and geology much more interesting than P2P cash.
And no, immutability is not the base of everything else. If you think so, this is, again, a very narrow and monolothic perspective. Every successful person knows that such a mindset is the beginning of failure.
(for example, Ethirium classix, which resistet the change of the blockchain, is way more vulnerable to changes as is Ethirium, due to its smaller hashrate / market cap ... )
Also your "slippery slope" arguments makes everything dependent on the communities backing of immutability. You will never have real and hard immutability, like you have with stars or the center of our planet, as it is just a SOCIAL AGREEMENT WHICH SOFTWARE TO RUN. The potential failure of the community will alway swing over your head like Damokles' sword. That's another reason why you should leave ... 


What people? Take away the employees of Blockstream / ChainCodeLab, take away the racks of faceless trolls, and it is very lonely in camp UASF / anti-2mb. Name just one serious entrepreneur or investor who is against SegWit2x.

Read better. I said: There are thousands of options. 
Also this part of our discussion is that you said, blocks must be full as a fact, and I said it is your opinion. You did not add anything to it. You just say over and over that you don't LIKE the alternatives. That's an opinion.


Thanks, I had the same result, but a more complicated formula.


A 2mb hard fork gives 2mb transaction capacity. Instantly and for everybody. SW soft fork doesn't.


Do you have enough haspower to add new blocks to the chain? If not, you can't. Know your limits. Bitcoin is a consensus system because you need to consent with the majority of hashrate to use Bitcoin. 


Native SW transactions are not even released. So you can't.




Do you say we have 100 percent SW adoption with 100 percent native SW transactions? If not, it is a lie to say SW = 2m. What is what you said. You can change your statement (I would be happy!), but you said this, it is a lie, and I will not let you get through with it (as long as I'm allowed to post here)

Thank you for this list! Awesome! Most is bullshit, and I, as a big blocker, are ashamed of it. But a few gems:


They are, wasn't this the whole idea of it? No malleability, no quadratic scaling, cheaper to spent and so on. You can't have god without the devil.


It doesn't make Bitcoin easier to understand when you have two transaction formats. Can we agree on this?


It does. Obviously. That's the idea of SegWit's malleability fix. And they sell 2nd layer products. That's a fact.


Don't know who runs the hubs, but they likely get centralized


It does, obviously. Or do you think with LN network wide fees will increase?


Depends on the definition. For example, you don't store keys or seeds, but transactions. Big difference for cold storage.


Am no expert here, but afaik that's not an absurd claim.
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:10:31
I agree with most of what you said and I like the term "Big-Block-Big-Adoption". That's to the point.
After all I see Bitcoin wider than you. There's privacy, censorshop-resistence, autonomy, inflation-resistancy and more. This discussion is just about one part of it. 
There is something I think you miss in this: The difference between surveillance and observation. Bitcoin, by itself, makes surveillance hard, and maybe mass-surveillance impossible. Make two transactions to yourself or to your friends, and no surveillance machine can know for sure who posseses the money. That's a big win for everybody compared to fiat system.
Observation is possible with Bitcoin. That's the good old detective's job. Follow every transaction, call this exchange, that casino. There are "cypherpunk"-methods to make it harder, maybe up to the point of making it impossible. But by itself observation Bitcoin doesn't resist observation. And maybe that's good, because it could allow the people to observe the politicians and gangsters. 
By hindering adoption you exclude a lot of people from being protected against surveillance. In fact, you strengthen surveillance on them, as it throws a spotlight on the group of Bitcoin using individuals. It's easier to map addresses with other surveillance data, when the group is smaller and more uniform.


Disagree. Their proposition is that censorshop-resistance (security) will be possible with more adoption and more transactions. That it will even profit from this, and that this will be a profit for the world.
Double-Disagree: This camp is not "mostly comprised of Bitcoin businesses and miners." At the scaling Bitcoin in Milano have been more businesses than at the future of bitcoin. Saying we are mostly businesses and miners is a prejudgement. Neither of us can know this for sure.


Here we are again on the initial question. Good businesses, bad businesses. 
Afaik blockchain.info, shapeshift and bitcoin.com use fiat as rarely as possible and pay employees in Bitcoin. Many businesses of group "Big-Block-Big-Adoption" did successfully fund their growth by income generated in growing Bitcoin and not Fiat-VC like, for example, Blockstream. 
The gist of this whole thread is that you sort bitcoin businesses in two groups, good and bad, and project some kind of techno-ideology on it. Seeing the world just black and white, has never been a good instrument for anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:35:21

I raised on single point: That you never get the needed adoption rate for making SW-blocks 2mb. You ignore it over and over again.

Says who? It is the view of a minority. Not the truth. If you can't discriminate between opinions and truth, it is boring to discuss with you. That's the basis for any intellectual activity to make sense. Many people, amongst them me, don't think full blocks are inevitable and necessary. 


Nobody steals money with a blocksize hardfork. Don't know why this is relevant. 




I do. Very much. But a narrow mindset is not a view. It can evolve to one, but mentally it is something like a dark embryonic state of thinking. Get over it!




That's what I try to tell you the whole time. You announced to leave because the SegWit2x case would be the start of a slippery slope into failing. By itself it is no failure. Since the success of SegWit2x doesn't make future changes more or less likely - it's all a social agreement / construction - it doesn't change anything about your reasons to quit. So better to quit now, because you will never get peace with Bitcoin and will always try to preserve freedom by trying to impede rules which software people should run. 


Why are you important? I don't know you, you could be a sockpuppet of some of the UASF puppet masters. No insult, just - I don't know why your assessment should be important for the ecosystem. 


No, it is not, and saying this is a lie.

Mining is naturally a cartel. And Bitcoin is all about giving power to the miners and not the nodes. If you don't like it, try Nodecoin or some other altcoin which has no mechanism to privilege write access to the ledger.

@_date: 2017-07-07 10:05:11


Nitty-picking: no. Stewarding blockspace != full blocks.


Out of my competence. The data I have separates just signature and non-signature data. It has 61-63 percent signature data, which results in at maximum 1.8mb. Hard to imagine how P2SH changes this, but maybe I miss something ... 


What a??? You promote SW as a soft fork but don't want to carry the consequences? And than you call it unfair to talk about it? What's wrong? It's not about fairness but about facts. 
That's like I advertise a solar panel and promote it like it would run with peak energy production 24/7 - and used a power inverter which is not even invented. That kind of advertisement would be righeously called dishonest. And the same goes for those pumping SegWit with the 2mb fairy tale.
Will not happen. So saying SegWit = 2mb is a lie. You promote SegWit with attributes that will not be true. That's a lie. End of the story. No way around. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:39:53

So, you will abandon the most exciting innovation of our lifetime because you think that "one day another hardfork, to steal user funds or create more inflation" will succeed?
You reduce Bitcoin to "the rules being resilient to change", even if this change is supported by miners, exchanges and a lot of users?


That's a very narrow perspective on Bitcoin, and I think if this is all what is interesting for you, it is better you leave. There are a lot of other things making Bitcoin interesting.
Also a success of SegWit2x doesn't change this a bit. The change is tot "arbitrary", but coordinated and discussed for years. It is just your idea that it will open the gates ... 
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:16:56


So. Will transaction capacity be as big as 2mb compared with current transaction capacity? That's my definition. And if you don't assume 100 percent SW transactions with 100 percent native SW addresses, you agree that the answer is no.


Real transaction capacity with real adoption predictions.


If this happens either Bitcoin has failed or another chain will attract more money and more hashrate.
Please be more polite. I try to make a point without ad hominems and non-argumentative simplifications like "stupid" or "nonsense."


Please be polite. Needing words like "rubbish" do not cast a positive light on your intellect. They make you appear like an old, angry, drunken men not able to react properly when confronted with arguments. 
To use an address to send funds to, a wallet needs to know the address-format. Right? Maybe you can hack an tx to a format your software doesn't know with the command line. But we agree that not 100 percent of users do this, right?


Please by polite and stop wrongly accusing my of lying. I never said that these address formats are necessary for SegWit. I'm well aware that SegWit doesn't need them. It is just a fact that it is IMPOSSIBLE for SegWit blocks to transport 2mb transaction capacity without these addresses. 


I heard otherwise and no expert ever disagreed that transactions originating from nested p2sh addresses are +10 percent in size of signature data.
At least Johoe said this after simulating segwit 
You are the first person disagreeing with this. Not even the strongest supporters of SegWit did. 


Please be polite. Calling me a moron does only show your inability to stand this with arguments.
SegWit is not 2mb if there is not 100 percent SW adoption with 100 percent native SW addresses. I said this very often. Do you agree or not?
If you agree, you either assume 100 percent SW adoption with 100 percent native SW addresses. That's by all means highly unlikely. So SW will not have 2mb. Why is this so hard to get?
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:35:56
Maybe you start to realize that the biggest threat for "us" is that the blocksize is not lifted. We want hard money p2p e-cash on a global scale. 
With SegWit we can only hope for this on LN. And most of us feel not comfortable with betting Bitcoin on the success of such a thing.
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:13:30
You create a differentiation that does not exist. 
The companies of SegWit2x do in no case undermine censorship-resistance and storing value. 
While you can argue that Blockstream/ChainCodeLab do attack it by reducing usability. Less transaction space --&gt; less mixing --&gt; less fungibility. Corporate Sidechains like Liquid --&gt; less censorship-resistance. And so on. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:32:30


Your statement was: "SW gives 2mb capacity". Which is a lie. There is nothing to compare.
That's like you say: "This building is 200 meter high". I say: No, it is not. And you argue: "But it is bigger than that building." Makes no sense.
Let's stick with facts. And fact is: SW is not 2mb. 


I didn't know that you meant "the 50 percent with 99.5% volume". Sorry. Assumed we talked about random 50 percent with 50% volume.


If the hardfork fails, this might happen. I was talking about a successful hardfork. Sorry that we miss our points.


Yes, Altcoins have this too. But Bitcoin should be defined as being the cryptocurrency with most SHA256 work in its chain. If you kill this property, you make everything arbitrarily. This would be the moment I would lose interest in it. That's how this makes sense, to answer your question. 


No. Educate yourself instead calling me three times a lyer. To get the full sw discount both parties need to be able to compute the new native sw address format, which does not even completely exist right now. As long as that is not given, the sw part of the tx has +10% in size.


So, you don't put your money where your mouth is? 




We are not talking about a hardfork. We are talking about misleading segwit promotion. 
So, I try to get this on another way: Will you repeat your statement that SW is 2mb? Is. Not can. Not under this or that condition. Strictly "IS 2mb", like you earlier said. Indicative. Or will you step back from it?
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:30:32
What will you do instead? Working with other cryptocurrencies or leave crypto space as a whole?
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:43:51


That's not true at all. There are thousands of possibilities how 100,000 users not running a full node can make Bitcoin stronger. For example, it becomes a better business to build light and SPV wallets. You can make some kind of pre-transaction mesh network with SPV wallets. They can help share requests, ip addresses and so on. Also the demand of this people makes Bitcoin more valuable and thus helps the "real users" to finance their node. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:26:31


This means your Bitcoins have a velocity of something like 1000. That's very untypical way to use money. Usually money has a velocity of 1 to 2. 


So we will never reach 2mb blocksizes with SW.


Wallets work perfectly with a hardfork. Only nodes are affected. Since Bitcoins are stored at keys, not at nodes, a hardfork has zero effect on old savings. 


How can you say this and still claim that sw = 2mb? You know that it is not true.


If SW does not prevent a hardfork, this is true. But only if. 


It makes it only safer for SW data, which meant it does add no safety to a future blocksize increase. Zero effect, untrue statement from you.


That's bullshit. You can easily fix the damage which can be caused by q h. Every implementation beside Core did this long ago.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:02:31
Didn't you promote UASF for some month? And is it your first node, or why do you need to sync it? Do you have a lot of coins for it, or hundreds of peers? Or why should anybody care that you set up a node, that did not exist before, just for the purpose of ignoring the stream of new blocks?
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:36:29


And this is your opinion, not a fact. Don't make the inability to imagine things to come otherwise the limit of your ideas.


We talked about network wide capacity, not individual capacity. Let's stay on topic.


Yes, but with a softfork people who don't update still use Bitcoin. With a hardfork they just stop using Bitcoin and are force to update.
With SegWit every single Bitcoin software needs an update to create more capacity. With a blocksize hardfork only full nodes need to update. Major difference in disruption. 


What do you mean? 




Your 80 percent have nothing to do with Blocksize. Nonsense can't be applied cross-topical. 
You still did not explain why you propagate the lie that SegWit gives 2.1mb. By all publicly available datapoints this is a lie. Why do you promote it?
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:06:19




Now we come closer. CAN. I don't even think it is possible, but I would be ok with saying "sw CAN be 2mb". If we agree to this, I'm happy.


Agree. They CAN. SW CAN be 2mb. It is highly unlikely that it ever is, but it CAN.


Calm down. You know what I mean. Since you seem to react strangely on these development groups, I will no longer talk about them.
Just this: Quadratic Hashing can make a transaction with a large number of SigOps. If this transaction is &gt; 1mb, it can knock out many nodes. So you limit transaction size to 1mb. Problem solved.
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:46:24
I thought about this


That's, again, not true, and you should, again, know that it is untrue.
Even if your transactions have 80 percent signatures, you will not get this discount for a long time. To get it, you need to update your UTXO. If I look a my utxo, a lot of them are years old, and I pick them as they fit in a transaction I build 
So updating your UTXO organically (with change and receiving) you'll need years to get the full discount. If you do it unorganically, you will pay higher fees. 
For example, I have hundreds of inputs from Cloud mining which have become unspendable because of the high fees. A blocksize increase would allow immediately to spent them. SegWit will help nothing.
So no, your statement is not true, again. 
It's not that I'm against SegWit. I just don't like that it is promoted with lies. Also it feels like it is not an enabling technology, but a preventing technology (prevents a hardfork). That's never good.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:01:12

That's your personal oppinion. Some say that miners will not allow this. Some say that at some point of blocksize every further transaction will increase risk of orphans. Some say that the technical cost of storing music files in the blockchain is prohibitive. Some say that this did not happen in Bitcoin's past nor in Altcoins. And so on. 
I say it again: Don't confuse your opinion with facts. This makes it really boring to discuss with you, as it is determined all the time what you gonna say. No insult, again. Just a request to throw away your blinkers.


That's the important word: CAN. A knive CAN kill people, but also be used to cut bread. You approach is to kill yourself because there is a knive in your house. No, wait, you know that the knive is there, like Bitcoin can always happen to be changed by social agreements, but when somebody starts to cut a bread with the knive, you tick out, because when the knive can be used to cut bread, it also can be used to cut throats. 




I'm sorry. Please see it as a request to open your mind. The single point which bears everything does not exist for in free minds. 


It is not, and you know this. It is 1.5 mb capacity with 100 percent SW adoption, and 1.8 with 100 percent adoption plus native SegWit addresses. More likely it is 1.3 mb capacity. Promising 2mb has been a lie from the beginning and it was repeated over and over, despite people presenting proofs about the real capacity gains.
Ask yourself: Why has not a single SegWit supporter presented a simulation of the capacity in mb depending on SegWit adoption and relation of Signatures? Because they did not want to let people know that SegWit's 2mb has been a lie.
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:16:45


Doesn't matter. There are thousands of possibilites. And if you care about cartels - Bitcoin mining IS a cartel, this way or that way.


Can you explain this part "This allows for 4/2.14 = 86.9% increase, or 1.87MB blocks."? Why 4/x? 
And what's with the P2SH bonus?
In my calculation I arrived at 1.5 mb (without native SW transactions)


They mean that SW will not give 2mb transaction capacity. That's not really hard to understand. And it is true.


I formulated it bad. Simply: Old wallets don't know that they need to / could update. Assuming that they update faster this way than the nodes that do no longer receive blocks is madness. Most people do not update as long as the software is working. While everybody updates if the software does no longer work.


You will not get a 80 percent fee reduction. You will get at max a 62% fee reduction. For standard tx you will get no more than 40%. A real blocksize increase with a 2mb hardfork would give you ~90 percent fee reduction.
Anyway, this still doesn't answer my question: Why do you advertise SW with numbers you know are wrong? And what are the real numbers?
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:06:25
So? Even GMaxwell said in his famous dipshit comment that the devs in Hong Kong promised a hard fork. Where has that hard fork been? When did Matt promote that hard fork? When did he even proposed it? Where is the official BIP for it?
So no, you can't hear it, I'm sorry, but that's the truth. If you don't like it, if you need to ignore it - just ignore it. But don't stop by to waste my time with such comments demanding that I become as blind to reality than you. Sorry, not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:24:56


It's a theory, yes. Your theory. Just stop taking it as a fact. Accept that in reality there is not one ring to rule 'em all. 


What do you mean with this? Fact is, with blockweight &lt;= 4mb there is no chance to get capacity of 2.1mb. Just do the math, if you don't believe me. 


I don't compare anything. I just state facts. 
And last time it was called an advantage that SegWit is a softfork. SegWit is much more disruptive to wallet and exchange infrastructure than a blocksize increase. Much much more. Which is why we never will have 100 percent. You might find this unfair, but it is a fact. 


Do the math.


We have currently not 65 percent, but 61-63 percent signatures. Makes a big difference in reality (~100kb)
IF we have 100 percent adoption and IF everybody uses native SegWit transactions and IF we assume an increase of Signature data to 65 percent - than we have a capacity of 1.95mb. Even in this case - which will never happen - 2.1mb is a lie. 
But as I said: In reality SegWit is more like a capacity increase to 1.3mb. Stating anything else is either a lie or hybris to be able to govern the behavior of a decentralized network.


Yes, sure, but if you get it finally you will quit Bitcoin ;)

@_date: 2017-07-09 17:50:56


What consequences? I have several nodes on several machines, and none of it has been effected by the bs increase from 0.8 to 0.9


Potentially, but not necessary. We can degrade security while maintaining CR, and we can increase security but loose CR. Both is not directly related. For example, Monero has less security than Bitcoin, but more fungibility, and PayPal maybe has more security than Bitcoin but less privacy. And so on.




So, you want an answer ... there have bee a lot, and if you say you don't heard them, you either did not listen or you did not like the answers.
So, to clearify: you can't measure markets, you don't have enough hard data about node infrastructure (CPU, bandwidth etc.), and decentralization is not a defined category for this community, but a semi-religious property which contains more or less everything good (security, CR)
Nevertheless, some scientists, including Decker and Sirer, calculated exactly this question. Their result was IIRC that we could have up to 4mb blocks without losing a significant share of nodes. Since this study identified block propagation as the bottleneck, and we had blazing enhancements in this area (thin / compact blocks, fibre, xpedited), we should be EASILY able to build 10mb blocks. 
There's your scale.
Anyway, I'd be ok with real 2mb. SW however is not 2mb. Never. Saying otherwise is a lie.


Every developer from Blockstream rejected any blocksize increase ever. The president even flied to china to make hollow promises to the miners to prevent a 2mb increase. The CSO printed hats to encourage a mob to fight activating SegWit with a 2mb increase. and so on. So yes, it is save to say that Blockstreams tries to limit blockspace at purpose.
About the reason I can only speculate. I guess it is something about "Cypherpunks write software that can only be used by true cypherpunk" and about liquid, the sidechain bringing liquidity to exchanges even if blocks are full. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:21:01

Stop lying. SegWit will never be 2.1mb, even with 100 percent native SegWit transactions (which we'll never have). This was prooven over and over. Why do you repeat prooven lies?
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:34:55


No, it is not, depending on the upgrade rate it is rather 1.2 or 1.4 mb.


If 100 percent upgrade, with 100 percent using a address format not even released by now, yes.
Upgrading is not the same as for hardfork. I told you before, several times, but I do it again. This are the differences regarding upgrading between a blocksize-hardfork and sw-softfork:
1. In a SW softfork EVERY existing Bitcoin wallet software and EVERY utxo needs to be upgraded to get to 2mb. In a 2mb hf only the full nodes need to be upgraded to let everybody enjoy 2mb. So: **a hardfork needs 10k machines or so to upgrade to let everybody enjoy a 2mb limit. SW softfork needs 100k or 1m machines to do the upgrade to get us to a 2mb limit.**
2. In a SW softfork wallets and nodes don't know that they can upgrade to more capacity, as they work on like before. This makes upgrading slow and will results in reaching never the 100 percent update quote needed to reach a 2mb limit (even I have wallets not updated for years). **In a hardfork full nodes who miss to upgrade become blind to the stream of new blocks. They must upgrade or are no longer part of the network.**
So, you might prefer this way or that way, but saying that "upgrading is exactly the same assumption" is: a lie.
