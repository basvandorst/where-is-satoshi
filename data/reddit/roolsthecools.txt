Doesn’t matter if it was a $40k transfer or a $2 transfer. You can cross getting a response off the list.

Again, it maybe be the only way he knew how to get a puppy. Have long have you known this guy? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:40:10
Not right now though

There are different types of faucets. Some give you something ever couple of minutes, some every hour and others everyday. You get a couple cents. No site will give you 0.0001 bitcoin every hour or so
Some places you do watch videos, or click on ads, or even just go on the website and click claim.

This doesn’t include other bitcoin correct? Example: BTC to LTC

Jordan Belford is that you?

Depends on the Faucet. You can either...
A.) go on every couple of minutes, hours, or Everyday and they’ll give you a very small amount of coin. 
B.) you can watch ads for very small amount of coin
C.) you can play games for a small amount of coin
Emphasis on small amount. I tried faucets for 3-4  weeks and only made 50 cents.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:29:33
You have to have a minimum amount of 0.002 I believe 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:20
No one KNOWS if you would make anything. You could you could make $2 or you could make $2000. On the other hand you could Lose $2 or lose $200

People can never be happy for one another. I understand you don’t agree with the way he bought his puppy (maybe it was the only way he knew how) but I’m sure you’ve done things that were unethical and wrong too. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:00:15
Did you get all your anger out? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:06
Sell as much ass possible. I’d be willing to buy your bit :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:34:54
Then we buy low................?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:43:35
This was literally just happening to me. Request to have a new amount sent to your account and try again
