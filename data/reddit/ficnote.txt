Because of the cost associated with each of those contributions. Tracking the ownership, preparing statements, etc.
There's a reason many mutual funds have minimums - and those are mature companies with lots of automation.
If you want to raise money to build a $5,000,000 warehouse, you would rather have 10 people give you $500,000 than thousands of people giving you small amounts.

Though, there are some reporting requirements even still, so this has not been popular.
There are so many rich people out there who can risk a lot that there just isn't enough demand to bother with even the minimal reporting requirements to let in small time investors.

Bad traders love to blame others for them being bad traders. Common bogeymen:
Federal Reserve
Hedge Funds
Paid shills
Foreign investors
Corrupt brokers
The real culprit is in the mirror. Predicting market direction is hard. Everyone in that list above is also acting in their own self interest and is subject to the same difficulties as you. Just look at all the hedge funds that underperform. They also suck.

Programming and assembling computers are quite different from attempting fusion.
But no, I'm sure there are a few deals there that will work out well. That one just stood out to me in a way that makes the site not seem super serious. I'm guessing they do nearly zero vetting of deals.

Fundrise, etc. All look promising.
While it is true that just because someone is not accredited doesn't mean they don't have $100k to invest - it is also dumb for them to put $100k into one speculative investment. That $100k represents anywhere from 10-100% of their money. It is dangerously stupid for them to invest all of it in one investment that is so speculative it has rules around it to try to protect the little guy.
Having $100K to invest is definitely little guy status. There are many investments they can do with that $100k that are more likely to pay off well: 
Index fund and focus on their career.
Pay for school to advance their career (assuming it's in a field that can pay off).
Use it as a savings buffer to actually participate in a startup instead of trying to seed one.

I have no idea where you are going there so I'll try to restate my point a different way.
Blockchains can track who owns part of a company, if they have chosen to use a blockchain to record who owns it. In that case, the blockchain is filling part of the role of a broker or clearinghouse - tracking who owns the company.
However, that is where the blockchain stops.
In the case of a real company with traditional stock, that company is subject to audit. That company is required to provide information to shareholders. Shareholders can see if the company is actually doing what it is supposed to be doing and if it is actually earning or losing money. They can have some idea of what their investment is really worth. You get none of that (today) with blockchain.
You get a number that says you own... something.

Yup. I'm there right now.
The hedge fund industry overall loses to index funds and is costly.
Private equity historically has beaten index funds, however, it ties up your money for several years. There is also speculation that private equity returns are likely to lag the stock market in coming years because private equity is just so flush with money they are running out of good projects to fund.
Just because something is forbidden doesn't mean it is better.
If I had $10 million, I would probably have $9 million in index funds and play with $1 million just for fun.
There are commissions and fees all over the accredited investor ecosystem. 6% commissions abound. Platforms like Fundrise bring that down to 3%, payable upon liquidation. That's not counting lawyer fees or maintenance fees etc. So for your $1m investment, you're shelling out $60,000+ just for the privilege to have your ego stroked for being rich.
On the other hand, $10,000,000 invested in VTI (Vanguard's total stock index), you would pay only $4,000 per year of expense.

Yes. As people outside of the libertarian and MLM groups learn about blockchain, more people will know that trading coins is just gambling with no basis in real value.
As is evidenced by reality.
Meanwhile, the actual real world benefits of blockchain will be developed by software companies and sold as a service or software package to real world customers. The tokens won't be the value. The ROI provided to the customer will justify a price that customer pays for the system from the maker.
Real uses like: cars sharing data. Do you automakers are going to use some publicly traded shitcoin to manage data sharing? No. Probably going to create networks of their own trusted devices to run their blockchain.
Same for supply chain managers wanting to track food all the way back to the farm it came from. Do you think the FarmCoin is going to be on GDAX and trade for $100b? I don't.

They have responsibility to their shareholders and are accountable to them.
And there is this profession - you may have heard of it - called accounting. That is where they tally up expenses and revenues. There is another industry called "auditors" - something that no one in the crypto community would want to be subject to.

Sure, it's real world value.
Just not $1,000,000,000,000 of value. More like maybe $100,000,000 of value.

Fundrise is the big one for real estate.  is an interesting one to fund games and receive a share of profit.
You can also buy stock in plenty of micro-caps on the pinksheets or own an ETF that owns them, such as IWC.

You aren't missing much. They don't tend to do very well.
I would see it as a useful addition to diversify a portfolio, if your goal is to own a bit of every asset class.
An alternative is to buy IWC

Even without accredited investor laws, you wouldn't be investing in startups because you are by definition too poor. People who raise money for these ventures aren't interested in your $1000. Even for accredited investors, the lowest of low minimums is usually $25k. But the really good deals have much higher minimums. $25k is for scraps.
So even if you do have $25k you want to invest, are you going to be a repeat investor with that broker? No? Why would they invest time in that relationship?
By the way, there is nothing to keep you from investing in your friend's startup. These laws are to prevent brokers from soliciting you to invest in startups unless you are "sophisticated" or rich.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:09:43
And those investments aren't subject to the accredited investor rules.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:13:17
If you are selling to accredited investors, the reporting requirements are _lower_. This is why the people buying into investments that have accredited investor requirements need to be rich or sophisticated. It is buyer beware and you are your own big boy and can decide where to invest.
And, no. The blockchain might track who owns a coin, but you have _zero_ reporting and information about what the entity you are "invested" in is doing. You don't see a financial statement. You aren't owed any of the profits. In fact, it's not an investment. You don't own shares in anything. You give money to some stranger on the internet who just has a whitepaper and likely won't deliver anything. And even if they do, you aren't owed anything.
That's the difference. In real investing, you own a piece of the company. As an owner of that company, you are entitled to know operational and financial details of that company - reporting. Investors demand reporting and accounting.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:08:06
And there are platforms you can do that with dollars.
You are allowed to. Brokers aren't allowed to solicit* to you.

Not if that ownership conveys rights and therefore thousands of people to answer to.

There are - for accredited investors.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:21:24
Wrong. There are multiple platforms for small investors where you do actually get ownership or a real payout.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:44:54
And it will always come back - until it doesn't, because it provides no real value and it requires new suckers to buy in to prop it up.

A hedge fund can do just about anything it wants.
If it is advertised as an absolute return fund or a market neutral fund, then sure, don't compare it to an index fund. But if it is a "capital appreciation" fund or some sort of slick/sophisticated fund that is supposed to beat the market, there are very few that succeed.
Renaissance for example, actually has done remarkably well. But they are the best in the world afaik.
Most people, even the super rich, would be better off in VTSAX than a hedge fund. Heck, just do a bond ladder if you really want to be sure to have positive returns and don't want to score your performance to any benchmark.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:34:55
You don't need it. I don't need it.
I would suggest that those who don't need it will eventually qualify anyway. If you are good at picking investments and earn enough to have money to invest, you don't need access to accredited deals to get rich.
There are a lot of people who do need it. I would suggest several of them post in and probably have an Elio reservation.
