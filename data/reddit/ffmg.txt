I have a spare PC, I am looking for a docker install for a lightning node.
Can anybody suggest one please.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:27:24
hum... not really, but ok.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:15:52
Hey, just following up on this, any chance to have the mainnet support as well?
Thanks man
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:13:44


A scam, really? Do you have a source for that claim?
I would be rather curious to look those up.
From what I hear it is all up and running and rather secure, I never heard the 'scam' claim before.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:27:02


Of course I do, but I am not the one making the claim.


I did, but I could not find any link to show that Verge is a scam, (at any level).
Hence the reason I ask for a source of some sort.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:00:53
A, very, quick google shows that the Wraith protocol is up and running.
I also cannot find an reliable claim that "Verge is 100% transparent like Bitcoin"
But anyway, this is not the correct sub to discuss this, I was just curious about your claims.
One thing I have learned on the internet, claims without any sources are probably not true. This seems to be the case here.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:21:38
Yeah, thanks, I saw it, (well, I asked someone else for it :)).
But your install seemed a little bit more straight forward, (I haven't really had a chance to look at his yet, so I could be wrong).
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:52:45
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:27:03
Actually Verge is better for that :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:24:01
This is great, thanks, I will definitely be playing around with it.
Will you be updating it when it comes out of testnet?
@_date: 2017-02-18 05:04:05
Even better, a wrong, arbitrary number.
@_date: 2017-02-20 03:58:40
Exactly, the insult was more in choosing one religion over others ... to imply that religions are all crap.    
It is just politically more correct to label some religions rather than others.
@_date: 2017-02-20 03:57:05
Really? You got that from my comment?    
    
Maybe read it again and try and actually understand what I am saying.    
    
Anyway, this is not the sub for this, I was just saying, next time pick on all religions rather than just one.    
... otherwise it kind of makes you point moot if you think that one religion is more worthy of mention than another. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 04:04:00
Really?    
So you saying that the people who just got blown up in Pakistan because the believed the 'wrong' kind of islam were not been told to have a different faith?
Anyway, this is not the right sub for this discussion, I just think the comment was wrong because picking one religion over another is wrong. But anyway, it has nothing to do with Onecoin/Bitcoin or Crypto.
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:59:58
Why insults Christians to make a point on a Crypto Currency?
Do you also insult Muslims/Jews/etc... or is that not socially acceptable to insult them?
@_date: 2017-02-19 18:52:19
"I'm not interested in logic or rationality. I believe in God."... sounds a lot like an insult to me.    
    
And insults are fine btw, there is nothing wrong with that, but why just pin this insult on Christians, why not Jews or Muslims or whatever else...
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:13:42
Well, if someone could give me me an image to in install it in my PI3 I would definitely run as a full node.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:39:15
Sorry, but this is not always true.    
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:10:14
I know that this will get buried, but I agree all-heatedly, this sub it slowly killing itself.    
    
Having said that, I don't think it is harming bitcoin itself.    
It is good to hear the opinion of the passionate as well as the sceptics.    
Some points are valid while others are downright crazy, (the EFT been a good example).    
    
I guess the difficulty comes into learning what to ignore, what to take with a pinch of salt and what to quietly agree with.
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:11:58
Every elevator    
... in the US    
... ... that has a screen    
... ... ... that show contents from CNN.    
    
So, everywhere really.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:41:16
Nope, down.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:25:29
Sounds like a good enough guess to me.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:42:00
$3500? That sounds a bit extreme, 
Maybe $3800 is more realistic?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:10:33
$10K was always my personal target, but it seems to be here sooner than I thought.
Now $100K does not seem that unrealistic, 
But $1Million does not really seem possible, not in the next 2 years or even 5 years, I don't think it can be done.
Am I too pessimistic?
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:22:57
Whatever man, 
Your boat story has nothing to do with South Africa.
Your slave story is wrong.
Your Dutch story is wrong.
I can only guess that you are confusing South Africa with other countries in Africa and America rather than Netherland, (maybe?), but then it does not explain you been wrong about the Dutch.
So I can only guess you have no idea what you are talking about and you cannot explain your, very wrong, statement "`The SA hate the dutch`".
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:53:50
I thought most serious miner, (not pools), were selling coins as they mined them, regardless of the price.
Are you saying that they are holding hundreds of coins?
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:34:18


But according to [coindesk]( 
 Segwit should have happened already.
Has it not yet been 'turned-on'?
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:36:13
No, slaves were brought _to_ South Africa, not _from_ South Africa.
And certainly not to the US, I think you are confusing South Africa with the rest of the continent. I also don't get your side point about Jewish boat owners, I suspect you have another agenda.
In any case, Dutch are not 'hated' in South Africa, maybe, (probably), they were in 1652, but they certainly are not anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:12:46
The Dutch were the first westerners in SA, (for trading).
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:12:09
Lol, no you don't, it's a shithole.
Trust the people that are still here.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:33:45
I am _almost_ the same, I used to trade in coins all over the place, but my net worth has only just slightly increased over the year.
Now I just hold alt coins that I actually believe in long term as well as Bitcoin, and I limit my bag to 2 or 3 coins max.
And if, for whatever reason, I choose to sell those coins, I just use them to convert to BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:47:05
Here we go again... apartheid
After 20 years, South Africa is not a 'Young' democracy anymore, apartheid was terrible, but the signs of it are less and less visible in everyday life, (inequality been the main one). The real reason for SA been a shit hole is for the ANC raping the country and not giving a shit about the people.
But to be fair, they don't give a shit about _any_ colour people, so at least they are consistent like that.
Corruption is at an all time high, do you think the poor are benefiting from the SAA/Eskom/Telkom/SABC debacle?
Water security is all but gone.
Crime is pretty much out of control, we all have to lock us in behind bars and alarms.
Schooling is a joke, 30% pass rate! Universities been forced to take students on colour rather than results.
State capture is real and also not benefiting the poor.
Direct foreign investments have all but stopped as well, if you're a capitalist, you know that this is not a good sign. If you are a desperate dictator, you blame 'outside forces'
Zuma faces +700 charges, that he miraculously managed to avoid for 9 years!
The list goes on and on...
Is it getting better? Really? Then I missed that memo ...
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:19:05


Ah.. so you know everything then rich kid, glad you can travel all over the world. 
Those of us who didn't run away, or can't run away, know what it's really like on the ground.
If you are not prepared to have a constructive discussion, don't waste my time.
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:49:07
There are.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:36:24
Not true at all. Where did you hear something like that?
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:42:07
Do I need to do something to switch over?
I checked and I have the latest wallet, (released in June).
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:52:59
This has nothing to do with South Africa or Dutch.
As I said, you clearly seem to have another agenda that has nothing to do with South Africa or the Dutch.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:08:57
... hence the reason I was asking what the "good news" is.
I can see that something good is happening, I am asking what is happening.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:55:31
Yes, I can see the price is going up... but I was asking what is going on with BIP91, the price going up does not tell me anything.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:55:58
Well, reading it, they don't seem too phased about anything.
Pretty much business as usual.
That's why I am curious.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:10:36
If true then it is a bit sad really... that they were prepared to sink BTC just because they wanted things to go their way or no way at all...
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:49:57
You're a star, all clear now,     
thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:09:06
Cool, sounds good then.
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:41:54
Is this just a big advert for an expensive USB drive?
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:37:47
Thanks, am I right in saying that the dev, (or non-miners in general), would prefer SegWit?    
   
And one last question, when will a final decision, (one way or another), be made. Will one ever be made?
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:15:38
Sorry, what does that all mean?
