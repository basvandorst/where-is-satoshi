The only problem I see with this is you can take her public key, look it up on the blockchain.... then see how many tips she gets a day. I don't know if someone wants that as public knowledge.

Just-dice or satoshibet is what I generally use to do this

@_date: 2014-07-07 18:57:09
I am sure it is, but I also don't trust strangers on the internet
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:41:48
Very cool project, you do need to loosen up a little while you are on the camera tho.

I send my dirty coins to a gambling website, do a very low risk wager then withdrawal to a new wallet created using TOR

Today would be the day, I just went and bought some more BTC at my local ATM 
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:06:20
Hate to break it to you but I will NEVER install any software onto my machine (especially bitcoin related) with out the source code given ..... I think every one should take my advice and stop the loss of your coins at the source.

@_date: 2017-03-10 20:56:06
I'm sure there will be many women following us to the moon my friend.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:34:11
This is exactly it, I would rather hold USD until bitcoin figures out what the hell they are doing with the block size debate. Once that is sorted out I am buying back in.

This is how the current ICO's work
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:27:43
There are many websites that list upcoming ICO's.
There are also tons of ICO's with physical products. Its a misconception that the funds raised from an ICO need to be for a crypto related project.

Ive used QuadrigaCX multiple times 
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:28:29
how about this, you purchase something from yourself worth $322AUD, then withdrawal your $1000AUD from your account.
Even if bitpay charges a 1% fee you are only paying $3.22AUD fee. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 17:47:38
This! any other way is nonsense.
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:05:09
Okay so now where do I buy my coins :/ 
@_date: 2016-07-04 20:26:25
That is so ugly

This sounds alot like 
saltybet is more fun to watch then dota imo. Who doesn't want to watch Goku vs mario fight :P 
@_date: 2013-10-13 13:57:57
that is very strange... I think they are trying a new method to crack the wallet password by sending thousands of small transactions in the same amount and then analyzing the data to see what they can get out of it.
