Smart contracts are automatically executable lines of code that are stored on a blockchain which contain predetermined rules. When these rules are met, these code executes on its own and provides the output. In the simplest form, smart contracts are programs that run according to the format that they’ve been set up by their creator. Smart contracts are most beneficial in business collaborations in which they are used to agree upon the decided terms set up by the consent of both the parties. This reduces the risk of fraud and as there is no third-party involved, the costs are reduced too.

Some FS organizations may be interested in blockchain’s disruptive potential. For example, its ability to facilitate secure, transparent transactions in low- or no-trust environments could disintermediate many traditional financial services. Blockchain could make bank branches obsolete, for instance. The trust created by blockchain also eliminates barriers to entry for new competitors in FS, from fintechs to tech giants like Amazon and Google.
