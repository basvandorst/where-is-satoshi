They also could steal your passport/driver's licence information and have a really good foothold into identity theft, verifying on exchanges is a thing that continuously confuses me why people are so willing to do.

"it has mostly purged itself of the potential for major scandals like MtGox to cause another crisis of confidence."

Except the bigger the gap between the biggest and smallest possible block size the bigger the advantage the small guy has. If we make blocks a thousand times bigger then the cunning pool will make blocks the same size as they now and have blocks that transfer a thousand times faster. It doesn't matter if that means a second vs 1000 seconds or an hour vs a thousand hours. It'll always be 1000x faster regardless of the absolute speed.

This time the guys that controlled the network for 12 hours had incentive to be good guys and make more money. Maybe the next group will have a big pile of shorts or be run by someone that doesn't like bitcoin or be run by a real nice guy who didn't secure his computer well and gets hacked or any other of the hundred ways it could have gone worse than it did.

And this isn't some "good news for bitcoin!" thing where the government has declared bitcoin money. 
This is just shooting down the dumb freeman on the land sort of ideas that the law is some videogame where you just need some stupid loophole and obama can't touch you.

I think that sort of thinking should be a big red flag of why it's not going to happen. 
There is just zero chance that a major part of the world economy is going to be diverted into making a bunch of random 'early adopters" multi trillionares. That just makes no sense.

I don't think you can gin up any sort or argument that either pow or pos hand coins out in any sort of fair or reasonable way. neither reward actions that are useful.

Bitcoin didn't actually "solve" the byzantine general's problem  in any mathematical sense. It's really bad marketing that that claim has gotten so much play. It's like how small children can solve the "knapsack problem" and how traveling salesmen actually manage to exist all without disproving P=NP.

I always want to ask: Why the fuck would you give your drivers licence to some random machine? Like if this was anything but bitcoin would that be a thing you'd trust? Some guy just has a ton of your information now, maybe to sell you bitcoin, maybe because he is harvesting a ton of personal information from idiots. 
Why would you hand over so much information to who knows who?

He's laughed at because bitcoin fell and left so few people who's predictions were funny anymore.

"EDIT 2: I want to know where people think bitcoin will realistically go. As one user noted Bitcoins wont be worth $100M or $1B ever so where does it have the potential to go and WHY?"
Think of it this way: there are people that own 10,000 bitcoins.  That is 10 trillion dollars. Bill gates owns .08 trillion dollars. It's just not going to happen. Society is never going to go "welp, this fat guy ran some dumb computer program for a week in 2010, better give him 2% of the entire output of the human race for a year"

The block limit isn't holding anything back, the block limit is 1mb now but every single mining pool holds it artifically at 350kb or 250kb or less.

Ghash double spent before (against satoshi dice) because one employee went bad. It only takes 1 computer if it is the right computer.

The graph he posted says 1.24 for a confirmation in one block. So like, an over 10% fee for a ten dollar transaction.

If people were organized at all there would be two blockchains each with a copy of the historical blockchain diverging at some certain point. Two altcoins called bitcoin. 
Realistic, if two factions each claimed they both had the one true bitcoin and both claimed to be real you'd probably get some shitty nonsense where both sides are submitting blocks to the blockchain and constantly rejecting the other ones forever and ever and have two blockchains that were accepted by different people.

I just don't see how 'the distribution is unfair" can be a criticism of pos when pow handed out almost half the coins based on "who's computer can play videogames the best".

Once the network is running on 2 laptops I will just buy 3 laptops and control all of bitcoin.

The claim is always "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" and it seems really vile to target people that can't afford to lose anything more.

Do remember not to circle jerk too hard about bitcoin winning by the world economy falling, this situation might not actually leave you more well off than you are now.

"What does it mean to not have a bank account in America? You hold your money in cash. You have a hard time getting health insurance. You can’t buy things online where goods are cheaper. You are at risk of losing your money or being robbed. Your cash loses value just from inflation. You lose time standing in line at check cashing places. You don’t have a good credit score so you cannot do anything that requires good credit, like signing a lease. You are effectively shut out of what normal life looks like for all other Americans. "
Bitcoin does literally nothing to help any of these things except maybe shop online for a limited number of things.
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:05:49
Vending machines seem like the worst possible use for bitcoin. Double spending would wipe them out without anyone around and 10 minute confirmation times is unthinkable. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:24:30
Which is BAD NEWS, not good news. Ghash.IO seems relatively benign. They gained total control of the bitcoin network and basically did nothing with it for 12 hours and it was fine. 
Will the next pool that gets 51% act so kind? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:34:07
Will they leave the business then shoot all their equipment into space or something? Otherwise you end up with a low hashrate and someone sitting on a huge pile of mining gear that could wreck the bitcoin economy that lost them money.

Bitcoin was handed out largely by what videocard your computer had in 2010, is "it's not faaaaaaiiiiiiir" really a valid argument that bitcoin is superior?

It doesn't matter if internet gets a bajillion times faster. A bigger file still transmits faster than a smaller file. If one block is 100x the size of another block the block will transfer 100x slower. It doesn't matter if you are using fiber optic or dial up.

megabits and megabytes aren't the same thing. But even if they were, The point is that if 10mb took 10 seconds then 1mb would take 1 seconds and always have the advantage against orphaning

The hype on bitcoin sure has backed off a lot, hasn't it? Now we are to the point bitcoin isn't a killer app, but one will come any day now, serious guys?

Very few people use bitcoin. They basically trade it back and forth with eachother. Less than 2 million people and maybe even less than 1 million people actually value bitcoin.

Why would the unbanked have a credit score in bitcoin that was better than it was in dollars? Why is the bitcoin bank going to deal with them when the dollars bank didn't? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:25:17
not really?  It really comes off as a marketing thing where someone is preying on people's ignorance of what it means to mathematically solve something vs a lay meaning of solve to try to make it seem like bitcoin was some mathematical breakthrough that it wasn't. 
Like the whole thing seems based on "some dummy mathematicians said it was an impossible to solve problem, BUT BIT COIN SOLVED IT"  when bitcoin did nothing of the sort. 
it's like when people look at code and tell you it will or won't halt then use the 'fact' humans can solve the halting problem as proof souls exist.

They didn't say that. They just struck down the freeman on the land style idea that you can break laws as long as you know one simple trick obama hates. In general most laws can't be skirted using simple gotcha escapes like transferring money through poker chips or potato chips or bitcoins or anything.

It hasn't replaced the federal reserve yet or even come close. There isn't even as many bitcoin users as there are people that owned an N-gage. Maybe don't put your cart too far ahead of your horse.

Organized as in: the two sides can speak to eachother with little enough disgust they do the best thing and split the network. 
It's trivial if everyone agrees what a valid block looks like, if one side decides a change is for statists or whatever and decides to be the one true blockchain and another goes with whatever bitpay takes you could have two groups broadcasting blocks that half the nodes call invalid forever and ever. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:00:45
Are you sure that is why people talk about him so much? And not because bitcoin fell by 60% and the one guy saying 99% ended up being the one guy left to mock so everyone double downed on him instead of mocking all the other people that had been right by saying the price was doomed.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.
“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”
“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”
The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”
“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”
“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”
He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”
I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.
“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.
“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.
“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”
It didn’t seem like they did.
“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”
Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.
I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.
“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.
Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.
“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.
I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”
He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.
“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”
“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.
“Because I was afraid.”
“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”
I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.
“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”
He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.
