Fractional reserve does not imply lending. It just means that the sum of your customers' balances exceed the amount of money that the bank actually have.
We do already have what are effectively Bitcoin banks in use (look at Coinbase). For any other banking service, what's to say that they don't sell more bitcoins than they actually have? They would not run into trouble until everyone decides to move their funds into paper wallets.

it stops when i say it stops!

hahaha, this gave me a good laugh

No, it's real. Anyone with a computer can generate a dynamic "list of all private keys". The problem is the sheer size of the key/address space. It's a move to cause naive individuals to sell.

Alright, will do ;) thanks!

So if Alice owns 1 BTC and buys something for 0.5 BTC. She actually cannot use the remaining 0.5 BTC until she receives her "change transaction". If the concept is new to you, I would recommend taking a look at:

Aw darn ya got me XD
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:41:54
Thanks for the tips. I was totally unaware of that last detail... How do we set the fee outside of the BitCoin client software? Say, I send BTCs from address X to address Y using Coinbase or Bitstamp?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:32:41
wi tu lo?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:54:32
HAHAHAHAHAH YOU GOT OWNED ;)
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:47:49
Haha, okay the PayPal thing was a bit silly I admit, but I don't have any BTCs yet. I didn't want to end up making a silly post about things that many experienced people should easily know. Some big questions I have are:
What are the major differences between MtGox and Coinbase? These are the two companies I've been eyeing. I am not interested in making real-time trading, which is what MtGox seems to be geared towards (I may be wrong).
How are prices determined on Coinbase? (I noticed you can't set your own). As MtGox is a big BTC exchange, it makes sense for its prices to be observed from its own market activity.
If I buy X bitcoins today (and export it to a physical copy). Does it not matter in the long term which "buying service" I use? It seems that all Bitcoin services offer some sort of "redeem private key" feature.
I do not have market expertise, but I suspect the recent rises in BTC prices may be due to wealthy, malicious individuals aiming to "crash bitcoin" again. How likely is this scenario?
Aside from MtGox and Coinbase, should I consider any other notable providers?
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:08:51
Wait, I thought there was a one-to-one correspondence between wallets and public addresses? Or is it the case that a wallet is an abstract layer which manages multiple addresses underneath?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:26:36
DON'T TELL ME WHAT NOT TO DO!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:31:43
Yeah I think I might have made a wrong assumption. I think Alice can compute the transaction to her own change (and thus use it later).
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:12:01
Oh, ok. Yeah I'm aware of that, just didn't know what you were referring to exactly haha
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:08:23
Another important detail to note is that the backing of a currency to precious metals is a liability, and ultimately, requires a central authority to enforce. Thus, it is in Bitcoin's best interest NOT to be backed.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:29:34
Yeah i did a 2 gate proxy too
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:33:03
Wow, I knew this might eventually catch on, but I didn't expect for two of the biggest charts to switch so quickly. Good on them!
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:48:51
Thanks for the explanation! Just curious though, who finally decides "now is the time to update" and dispatches the update itself? I'd imagine there is some single move that dictates the start of the process?
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:28:04
I see, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:11:37
Oh, I might understand what is going on. So basically if I have the private key to address X (which holds 10 BTC). I can "announce" what the recipient address is (Y) and how much it gets (1BTC), as well as how much change is returned (9BTC) and where the change goes (old/new address)?
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:08:57
shh, it's sleeping..
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:57:57
they are :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:32:37
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:58:28
Yeah, I find this a bit strange as blockchain.info guesses the recipient and the amount the recipient receives. Can anyone add to this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:08:02
1, holding :)

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:01:20
Well no, this is very possible. Suppose [Bitcoin Bank] holds 100 Bitcoins, but the cumulative sum of their customers' wallets add to 200 Bitcoins. Now they can get away with it perfectly as long as their "hot wallet" size doesn't exceed 100 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:01:21
Companies don't actually reserve a wallet for you to store your funds. This would make off-chain transactions pointless and would tie up the Bitcoin network. They give you public address which can accept Bitcoins to be added to your balance, but these addresses are not storages themselves (they get emptied pretty quickly).
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:27:43
I just asked a similar question in a different thread. Hope it helps! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:10:52
I've updated the post with an example.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:45:30
Massive backlog of unconfirmed transactions. The rate of block generation is having trouble keeping up. Hopefully it won't induce panic (transactions will go through eventually).
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:59:49
It functionally is an online wallet, but it literally is not. When you store Bitcoins on Coinbase, you cannot access a private key. If you want Coinbase to export to a paper wallet, you can do so, but your Coinbase balance will drop accordingly.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:36:56
can we get a holla from ?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:51:15
If you do this, don't expect Coinbase to ever do business with you again.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:43:35
Hey, my first tip ever! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:10:15
A bank is just a trusted third-party which holds your Bitcoins. These services exist today.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:13:49
I don't understand what you're getting at. Suppose the sum of all Gox balances is 1 million Bitcoins. What's to say that Gox may only hold 500,000 bitcoins? Keep in mind that when you use services like Gox you do *not* have access to a real bitcoin wallet which store real funds (until you make a transfer).
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:43:05
From experience, sending two in a row "works", but what is happening under the hood?
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:29:02
Wow, really appreciate the reply! Another thing I was wondering was regarding instant transactions (basically, what merchants would rely on). I read that a transaction isn't "reliably" completely (and theoretically reversible) until 2 or more entities have verified exchange. How does this not pose a problem for said merchants?
Additionally, if I make a transaction, sending BTC from address X to address Y (both of which are mine), is there any chance for the BTC to be lost? My guess is no, since the blockchain will either fail to register the transaction (in which case the money still belongs to X) or it will succeed (in which case the money is recognized globally as belonging to Y). Am I right about this?
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:09:07
With services like Coinbase, which is serves somewhat as a Bitcoin bank, we don't actually control the wallets which hold our funds. We have a "Coinbase" balance which is redeemable for "real" bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:26:41
Even when we touch a 1MB block, the limit won't be that noticeable. Just means there will occasionally be a backlog of unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:34:51
ahh ok I see. I didn't even realize there was a transaction view. So I see now that the 0.0068BTC is the change from combining two inputs. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:57:03
I see, that makes more sense. Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:07:44
Can you explain what you mean? I'm curious
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:19:15
No, people already effectively place their bitcoins in banks. When you use Gox/Bitstamp/Coinbase, you do *NOT* have access to a private key to a wallet which stores Bitcoins. You have Gox/Bistamp/Coinbase "points" (sort of like IOUs) which are redeemable for Bitcoin transactions (into a wallet of your choosing).
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:29:35
Yeah. It will be problematic when the *average* transaction size/rate necessitates &gt;1MB blocks though.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:01:50
Keep in mind that it will take awhile from the concept to catch on with non tech-savvy people. When the internet first came out, the general public had a "wtf is this useless crap" mentally towards it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:41:18
Oh dear....
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:09:33
I like your response, thanks for the feedback!

edit: fool me you can't get fool'd again
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:58:46
Is this how blockchain.info guesses correctly most of the time?
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:25:50
I wasn't even aware that gold claims exceed total gold, haha, wow. But yeah that's the gist of it.
