I decided to research this crypto scamming by Chinese girls, or people pretending to be a girl haha...Yes Tinder is awash with crypto scams from pretty Chinese girls pretending to be located in London, or are in in Hong Kong. It seems it is always Chinese girls from my experience. It takes only a day of using Tinder to have loads of these girls and it is not long with messaging before they try to scam you with crypto. They will send photos of them on holiday, their family, their cars....chat to you for as long as it takes...weeks or even months...they talk about everything about their life. So it is so easy if you are new to crypto to be lead into a scam.  These are quite sophisticated scams preying on guys looking to meet a nice lady. The intentions are good but sadly those they chat to are filth. They are obviously low life's and scumbags. I hate it when people say if you are stupid to believe in them, you deserve to lose your money. How is that an actual thought. More like a short cut to thinking and a display of equally ignorant, low life morals. I have sympathy for any victim of liars and cheats who can't earn money honestly. Its the criminals involved who you should vent your distaste for. They are the detritus of society and deserve to be locked up. My advice to anyone is do not talk to Chinese girls on Tinder. From much research it seems the majority are scammers. Do not trust them and never do business with them. So much of China's population is one of greed and they will do anything to acquire money. Having been there and dealt with them, my advice is stay well clear. Of course there are exceptions but it is almost impossible unless you have Chinese connections to know if they are honest or just down and dirty cheats. And they wonder why they have such a bad reputation all over the world.
Current exchanges to stay well away from are:
Warning...do not trust Chinese girls in Tinder
