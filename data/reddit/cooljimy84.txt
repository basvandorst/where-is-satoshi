Can't help too much, but I would think that the web interface would be on port 80 or 'web'. Can u access it internally ? I.e. 192.168.1.100:8888 
If u have not : then it will be on 80 unless it then forwards you to another port...
I would not (personally) forwarded 80 or the default port to the internet as people may be able to take control of it, unless it has very good security.
Please excuse the spelling mistakes, it's Friday pub time here !

Most of these sites are private invite only torrent sites.
It does make u wonder....

Nuke it from orbit, its the only way to make sure...
