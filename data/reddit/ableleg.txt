It's a good read of how it can be done.  Whether it's still happening is another thing.  But we can't have it both ways - unregulated and yet have some semblance of protection against manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:24:59
Quite obviously, because they don't have the $B in hard cash.  So instead they printed Tethers from thin air to buy the BTCs.  Next step - pay a premium for BTC using Tether.  As people believe 1 Tether = 1 USD, arbitrage steps in and start buying BTC using USD at higher price to sell for Tethers, hence raising BTC/USD price.

If there's a subpoena with a court hearing coming up, there are only two possible routes to take.  A.  Conduct a proper audit so that it's well prepared for the hearing.  B.  Continue and ramp-up the illegal operation and prepare for an exit/disappearing act before the hearing.  They have printed $650m in last one week so which route do you think they are taking?

Hi, I wasn't aware there's an ETF for coins.  Does it really exist?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:56:44
But why call it FUD when these are facts.  I got in at 11.5 and am waiting for this issue to be sorted before I put money in.  Last thing I want is to put more money in and wake up to another Tether bad news and price drop.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:50:14
I think 80% is exaggerated.  There is no real maths and the price will depend on market reaction.  E.g. VMWare's stock dropped over 16% yesterday because Dell is "considering" a reverse merger.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:00:31
I'm more inclined to think that because it's hard to price BTC, it's all based on sentiments and the market is sort of rationalising to itself that 10-12k is 'acceptable'.  So unless there are events that forces a re-evaluation (e.g. news of wide adoption, etc), there is no real push factor for it to go up.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:49:24
Was there an audit?  The only news I heard is that they dismissed their auditor without an audit and got subpoenaed.  Frankly, I wish bitfinex will just do the damn audit and clear the air.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:14:50
Compliance is when the court hearing has been conducted, which it has not.  If bifinex is legit and there are no wrongdoings, it would have appointed an auditor to prepare for the court hearing.  If it's not, it should be maximizing it's illegal operations and preparing for an exit.  Which is what I suspect they are doing.

@_date: 2018-03-01 14:14:48
Our governments are not interested in whether BTC is worth $10k or $100k.  They are also not interested whether we pay $5 for a Big Mac.  What they want is control over how many hours we have to work for that Big Mac.  Fiat is their ammo and fiscal policies are their buttons.  Raise interest by 1% and it brought the whole Wall Street to it's knees.
Now, do you think governments will allow BTC/cryptos which they have no control to take over fiat?
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:34:07

Ok, genius.  The prices of using the Internet, fax and mobile phones dropped with adoption.
Show me a counter example and I rest my case.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:10:57
VISA is fiat and Bitpay is well, BTC.  But your point is taken - I agree that cryptos have potential as a currency for day-to-day usage.  
Cryptos need to be regulated to a level where price manipulations are managed and thus a stable, true consensus based price reached.  Then adoption as a currency and even as a longer term store of value.  As is today, it is not.

New money and momentum.  
The theory is that when price drops, new investors will come in and start building increasingly higher base.
For assets where price is 100% speculative, that's the only way it can increase.  This is unlike stock, where price can increase based on good earning reports, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:52:38
Hello?  "Make MONEY from the price".  
What do you think it's meant by MONEY?  It is fiat MONEY.  If not, a BTC is a BTC and nobody will care about how it's priced in fiat.
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:11:08
I think you should first look at STORM and how it's pumping up BTC.  It's another Tether and both might cause problems.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:01:40

@_date: 2018-03-11 03:06:06
I can easily call hodlers "idiots" as well for believing that the price will reach some moon based on fantasy stories.
But let's not get personal.  We are all just speculating.  What's wrong with accepting that there is a difference between speculating that BTC will moon in distant future and speculating that it will rise 10-15% tomorrow? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:54:50

Lol .... stop encouraging shorting.  He might lose his pants.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:03:46
It's the same - hodlers or traders, we are all just speculating.
The only differences are time horizon and acceptable margin/risk.
To claim that hodl "always work" or "consistent" is being delusional.  First, until the moon comes, funds are locked which can be used to profit elsewhere.  Second, the moon may never come and hodlers will be the ones holding the bucket if it crashes.  
So, make your own decision on whether the 10-15% gain/loss per day is good.  Or if you want to hodl till it reaches 100x (or whatever is the fantasy number).
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:41:55

@_date: 2018-03-02 02:21:28
Just because there is a higher flow of trades in BTC doesn't mean that the price of BTC will increase.  
There are far more people using mobile, Internet, etc but the price to access these services have DECREASED.

My friend, the reason why banks and credit cards flourish have nothing to do with technology, privacy or freedom.
It is all about Debt and easy access to credit.  The average American household carries over $16k just in credit card debt.  It's their addiction to spending more than they can afford and no crypto can help here.

You live in a fantasy world created by the people churning out coins and the exchanges.  It's what I call the False Economy.  
No value is actually generated other than coins exchanging hands and a couple of fools paying cash in the process.
In the real economy where 99.999% of the world lives in, value is created when services are rendered or products produced.  And fiat is the medium for payment and people do not get 'rich' by holding fiat that goes up/down 50% every couple of months.

Don't be too sure.  Remove the Tether pumps and see what happens.

May I know exactly what FUD are you referring to?
What I see in this forum are plenty of claims that BTC will rise to $xxx or whatever ridiculous numbers and equal number of claims that it's a bubble waiting to burst.
The simple fact is that nobody knows what is going to happen next as BTC's price is 100% speculation so either party can be right.

@_date: 2018-03-01 02:14:47
I think what is sad is the amount of hype and speculation.  BTC has spiked only twice in it's history (2013 and 2017) and both are due to price manipulation.  In between, it has stagnated/crashed and we are in the midst of crashing of the 2nd spike.  Facts, bro.

It might go up ... or down, with equal probability.
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:06:59
In short, FSB basically said that cryptos are too small to make a dent to financial markets and they have better things to do.  
In a way, it's good news - that basically means that all the price manipulation can continue and we can see some healthy gains as a result.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:35:00

Sure, go ahead and break the USD.
When it happens, BTC will be worth $1m but you still can't buy a lambo in America because it will cost $500m due to USD inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:49:51
For many, it's a lack of choice.  The largest exchanges like Binance, OKEx and Huobi don't do fiat.  
So Tethers are accepted because they think it's tagged to 1 USD and therefore, not volatile.  The system works as long as Tethers remain in circulation and 'believed' to be worth 1 USD.  But if ever the plug is pulled, there will be chaos.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:45:07

That is the biggest bull crap statement ever.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:54:16
It is possible but there will be resistance - by regulating the exchanges (which is the primary source of this mess).
Exchanges must be audited to eliminate white-washing, price manipulation, etc.  And 'bumpers' put in place to limit price variations (e.g. 0.1% per day).
Exchanges should serve the purpose of fiat conversion, not profiting from speculations.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:11:26
No doubt.
But the problem is that despite the massive flow, your inflation has not increased much so it's hard to justify a tougher policy.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:50:57
10% from 52 week high is a correction.

It is meaningless to apply 401k recommendations to BTC.  These are tied to investments with proven long term viability such as stocks and bonds.  
Trying to do so with an asset which is priced based on 100% speculation is not low risk - it's as good as buying a lottery ticket except you bleed on paper along the way.

It is a futile argument.  I'm not suggesting that BTC is a bubble and will crash.  Rather, no one has been able to give a definitive value to BTC and hence, the price is 100% speculative.  It can be anything between 0 to moon.

Wash Trades = Buy/Sell/Buy/Sell within small group to jack up the price by 300%.  Despite $1.8B of trades, market cap went up by only $150m.  
The pumped up STORM is then used to trade for $446m of BTC.  Most of these trades are also mostly wash trades since total STORM is only worth $250m.  Which means BTC price is also artificially pumped up (same technique as using Tethers).

I'm still waiting for 11.5k to be back in the black.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves.  The 6k crash started from 11,935 and we still need to close the gap before we celebrate.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:16:36
Of course the values of alts are relative to BTC (and other alts) simply because exchanges offer trading pairs based on these.
Where a fiat/alt is also offered, then arbitrage happens during price movements.  E.g., if BTC/USD tanks, it becomes cheaper to buy an alt using BTC on these exchanges.  This puts pressure on alt/USD and arbitrage starts between alt/BTC and alt/USD till there's a new market acceptance of the two pairs.
Because most exchanges offer trading pairs between most of the cryptos, they are now somewhat interlinked whether we like it or not since arbitrage will always even things out.  So entire cryptos rise and fall together more often than not.  And because BTC owns the lion's share of the crypto market cap, it's influence over the alts is much higher.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:25:34

Let me give you an alternative perspective -
Over $800m in USD were dumped in last 24 hours with little price impact.  At some point in time, the buyers will be saturated and the crash will start to the next support level.  
Full disclosure - that's when I will buy in as I believe there will be a follow up pump.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:14:22
Adoption as a currency?  Not going to happen for BTC.  The odds are stacked against it and it is self destructing with all the speculations.

There is no difference between Tron and BTC where price is concerned - both are speculative.
For all we know, BTC might crash to $100 tomorrow and people will be asking "why the fuck would you put 10k into BTC".  Same story, don't gloat at others' misfortunes.  You might be on the same boat.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:33:30
When it starts getting down to that level, there will be people swearing support at $1k, $5k the next month and then the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:29:20
BTC is actually a lot more complicated than stock for two reasons - (a) multiple exchanges and (b) multiple currencies and alts.  
The USD price of BTC is affected by both.  
 is a good place to see both factors at play.  If you want the detailed lot info, you need to go to the exchanges' website.

If you believe in the tech, then why let the price irritate you?
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:14:11
First, you have made $0 until you sell.
Second, all purchases made above current price is on paper loss, which totally invalidated your point that hodling is a "consistent way to make money".
You will probably claim that purchases above current should hodl and will eventually profit.  But that is pure speculation as there is zero evidence that the price of BTC will continue to appreciate.
So what's so hard to understand?  Your mental obstacle is a refusal to believe that the price of BTC may crash permanently.

Where are you seeing this data?

@_date: 2018-03-01 13:29:59
It will improve adoption but no, why should it impact price?
Fiat is the default income for most people.  BTC is an intermediary to trade for the object of desire (say Lambo).  BTC at any stable fiat/BTC rate will suffice for this purpose.  Why should it warrant an increased rate?

The whales, ICOs and exchanges are all collaborators.  That's why Tether and Bitfinex are owned by the same people.  And their largest customers are the whales.

Cryptos will be a good alternative currency in the distant future.
At this stage, it's just a massive scam orchestrated by ICOs, exchanges and whales.  
So what is mostly likely to happen next - major shake up.  We will see exchanges like bitfinex and binance "disappearing" with customers' deposits, tethers and pumpings being exposed, massive price crashes across all cryptos, regulators stepping in, etc.
Then a fresh start with cryptos that are supported by governments and banking industry and exchanges that are highly regulated.

While that is true, have you asked yourself why?
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:41:38
No.  If it wants to be accurate, it should report USD/BTC as what it should be - trades in BTC using USD.  But instead, it includes all BTC trades including those made using other coins and try to "estimate" the USD equivalent.
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:55:31
If it's at a loss, then perhaps not.  But if it's at a profit, I don't see why not in such a bearish environment.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:39:58
It is not FUD.
But neither is it anything serious as it is just the Japanese government insisting on exchanges being properly licensed and Binance is being non-compliant.  Business as usual, no big deal.

Gold has a value because it's held as reserves by governments.  In fact, it is Gold that originally gave USD it's value before fiat was introduced.  I don't see how BTC can be compared to Gold.

There is no science to it simply because BTC's price is speculative.  
But you don't need TA to see that (a) price will hover around 9-11k followed by (b) a crash and recovery.  
So just wait for next crash to buy in.  But of course, if it turns out to be the final crash, then you will get burnt.

Bitcoin will never 'fail' as you correctly described.  But whether it's worth $100 (before 2013), $1k (before 2017) or $10k (now) has nothing to do with it being a limited supply asset.  It's based purely on what the market thinks it's worth and clearly, the market changes its mind by the minute so it's anyone's guess.

Well, there wasn't any reason to increase from 6k to 11k either.  If you are looking for a reason, then it's likely that people who bought below 10k (probably those who bought during the 6k crash) wants to take their profit out.
Without a well grounded 'acceptable' value, the BTC will fluctuate according to sentiments.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:21:37
It goes into safe havens (i.e. dull boring low yield but stable assets).  Most of the money is going into bonds this time because of higher interest.  And please don't put cryptos into same class as gold/bonds.  It's too volatile.

I have no doubt that a failed American economy is bad for everyone.  But the vacuum will be filled by the other major powers.  Let's take Singapore where I live in (which is pro American), and employed in an American company.  I face competitions from China and Japan every day and they are getting stronger.  If the American economy fails with it's companies, Singapore will take a big hit since it's our major capital investor, trading partner and employer.  But I have zero doubt that the vacuum will be filled quickly by China, Japan, Korea and to lesser extent, the Europeans.

Hong Kong, well known for it's business friendly environment, is booting out the exchanges.

Rubbish.  It is totally relevant because without an audit, there is ZERO assurance that each Tether is worth 1 USD.

@_date: 2018-03-01 14:02:58
Wrong.  Metcalfe's law was talking about the multiplying effect of connections.  
if we want to extend the analogy to Internet companies (I assume you are referring to the Googles and Amazons).  Their value is derived from the value added services they created, separate from the underlying network.  
It will be the same for BTC (or cryptos in general).  There will be new companies developing services that take advantage of the unique properties of cryptos.  That means increased adoption but doesn't mean increased price.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:21:04
Either you are clueless or a paid shill.
If someone claims that he has $1b and to transact on that claim; then the onus of proof is on him.  Tether has refused to date, to allow an independent auditor to do that.
Why would people buy Tethers with cash?  I can only speculate - this is a scam run by whales and they are probably paying Tether a dime for every USTD.

Don't.  It has not even recovered to the start of it's last crash (6k).  And this has been going on for over a month.  
So my guess is that price is being suppressed so that everyone who bought between ATH and 28/29 Feb will not sell and make way for the whales to cash out. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:10:15
Don't know about the rest but for me, it's quite simple - BTC has not yet recovered from the 6k crash.

That is a huge "if" that is founded on .... nothing.  If we keep making sweeping speculations based on wishful thinking, it does nothing other than create mirages and crashes and the rest of the world calling it a bubble and ridiculed.
What is more realistic is that BTC gets easier to use and accepted as an alternative currency to fiat.  For that to happen, the fiat equivalent of BTC must first be stable.  When that happens, more and more merchants will price their goods and services in BTC (regardless of fiat).  The price of BTC will then appreciate/depreciate in accordance to it's usefulness.

People who invested in companies like FB profited because FB created value and generated profit, which drives up it's stock price.  
How much profit has BTC generated by itself?  $0.  The price is therefore purely speculative and is thus subjected to The Greater Fool theory.  People who invest now are doing so simply because they believe there is another fool willing to pay a higher price later.  And that person is a fool because there is absolutely zero basis for it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:32:34
You are wrong in so many counts that it's tiring.  
First, the only relevance of Patriot Act with regards to currency is the use of it to launder terrorism.  Which is not relevant here.
Second, you over-estimate the weight of a subpoena issued by an American court.  For a non-American entity (company or person), he is not obligated to respond.  A subpoena from an American court to a non-American is as good as toilet paper.  Likewise, you (assuming you are an American) will treat a subpoena from a Chinese court the same way.
Third, you over-estimate the importance of the issue where governments are concerned.  They have more important matters to resolve than a fringe group complaining about cryptos.
Fourth, it's not the gravity of a trade war that matters.  Rather, it's so insignificant in the grand scheme of things that it's not even worth discussing.  There is 5.3T in forex trades and a declining US Dollar - that is worth discussing.  
Fifth, this is a commercial matter that will be dealt in a Hong Kong court if Interpol/ICAC intervenes.  That's as far as it goes.
Like a lot of people here, you are simply delusional about the importance of BTC.

The primary casualty will be US, not creditors.  Things were different in the 80's when US commanded a GDP that is bigger than China and Japan combined.  It's not today and if America collapse, life goes on in rest of the world.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:37:10
Yes, and that's because it has little intrinsic value.  It's not like stock, which has earnings/dividends to guide it's price; bonds, which has coupon rates or oil, which has consumption.  
BTC's price is 100% speculation with zero guidance.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:42:54
The simple fact is that your so called "massive appreciation" is just speculative pricing.  It's not like someone just invented free energy where the masses can enjoy without paying the energy cabals.
The only reason for a person to pay $8k today is because he thinks he can sell it for more tomorrow.  If there isn't, then he is screwed because there is little intrinsic value in BTC to lean on.
If you don't understand these basics and start calling others a "naive moron", you are making a fool of yourself.

It's a bit disappointing but agree with most of your points.  I was sort of hoping that the bounce will last longer.  
When it failed for the 4th time to recover from the last crash ($6k), I felt that the game is over and sold my last batch at around 11.2.  Well, maybe if it crashes really badly, I might be tempted to get in again and might be one of those holding the bucket :)

Cryptos do not change the wealth distribution, I do not know where this notion comes from.
In fact, BTC has one of the highest concentration - 40% of it owned by 1,000 wallets.  And that means (coupled with unregulated market), price manipulation at their whims.

This is just a personal opinion - We are now in the 'everything bubble' due to 8 years of quantitative easing where almost all assets are over priced.  BTC/Cryptos is the 'canary in the coal mine' and the stock market is now also in major correction.  As BTC is relatively the most volatile, we won't see recovery of BTC until the rest of asset classes are stable.

The important point about Tether is not whether more are being printed but rather, how much of daily trades are made using it. 
As this moment, trades using Tethers is still larger than USD.  In fact, the volume is hugely inflated - the bulk of trades is crypto/BTC which means the actual flow of fiat into BTC is small.  And we haven't even taken into account whitewashing between cryptos to inflate the volume.

I believe the main reason why people hodl is because they need the big 20x (or whatever) multiplier to make meaningful profit.  Its sort of like lottery hoping to cash in big.
If you do have significant resources, then trading is obviously more rewarding.  
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:35:32
It's better to be lucky than hodlers still hoping to be lucky .... some day.

Wow!  You must really believe what you wrote :).
Sorry to burst your bubble but cryptos are just an irritant where the financial industry is concerned.  You have vastly overrated it's significance.

Hello?  Hovering at 11-12k before crash was just 2 weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:36:28
May be the opposite - hodlers may be the ones burnt to the ground if BTC crashes.
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:09:03
Please stop misrepresenting.  It is not bullish news.  
FSB is saying that cryptos are too small to make a dent to financial markets.  I.e., we can crash and life goes on.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:45:19
The price is not as fragile as you think and neither are serious monies trigger happy.
If there is a sell, it means that the news is real and bad, not FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:51:25
"Fiat hates and fears it"?
You obviously didn't get the message - Cryptos are not significant enough to warrant their time to regulate it.
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:35:20
You will be surprise how efficient the bots are.  Nowadays, arbitrage is mostly automated and the bots are pretty fast at spotting gaps and triggering the buy/sell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:08:47
Yes, that's why my opinion is that it's solid at 6k to 7k.  But notice that above 7k, the volume has tapered a lot?  That's why I said anything about 7k is wobbly.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:55:36
And you think you are strong by hodling?  Nope - you are irrelevant.  The only effect you have on the market is to reduce liquidity by taking coins out of circulation.  Which plays nicely to whales manipulating prices.  Of course, you aren't smart enough to figure this out.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:32:18
There's plenty to learn about investing than from cheesy BTC advertisements.
 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:30:42
Won't happen.  One of the most important aspect of corporates' share price is predictability on earning results.  It's an expectation game and Wall Street don't like surprises.  
So how do you manage expectations over a quarter with a currency that can fluctuate over 20-25% in a single day?  I pity the sales managers who have to provide weekly sales forecasts.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:08:41
Most alts are not traded for fiat.  It needs an intermediary like BTC.  So when BTC goes up/down, the BTC/alt changes accordingly.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:25:51
I love BTC, what are you talking about?  But I accept the reality and happily taking calculated risks to profit.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:54:51
Here's something for you to chew on - 
Of all the asset classes, BTC is the most concentrated in terms of wealth possession.  Good night :)
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:54:45
Yes, agree.  It's pure speculation and everyone has a risk/greed tolerance level.  For me, if I had bought at $6k, I will be very happy to sell at $10k and wait for next dip.  
Sure, it might go to $20k but I had enough of these "missed profits" that it won't really bother me.  To me, profit is profit = be happy (even if less profit).   
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:43:57

Probably people who bought at much lower price, believe it's going down so they sell.  Plenty of other possible reasons, don't bother too much about it.

I rather see this as a great place to speculate but don't get caught with the shit can when it crashes.
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:46:46
He's just suggesting that we should be prepared to weather the dip.  Why are you guys so aggressive to anything other than good news?  For pete's sake, this is a neutral forum to voice opinions.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:29:59
No, you don't.  When you sell short, you owe the exchange the BTC.  No BTC is actually traded.  When you liquidate the position, you profit/lose the difference in price by covering the shortage.  You never own any BTC throughout the process.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:38:25
Yes, I know it's on decline since ATH.
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:30:10
Yes, but not in a direct way.  Price on Bitmex, like any exchange, is dependant on the bid/ask prices for people trading on it.  Likewise, GDAX behaves in the same way.
When there is a difference in price between exchanges, arbitrage will happen.  I.e. people will buy from the exchange with lower price and sell it at a higher price on the other exchange.  What then follows is that prices are brought to the same level across the exchanges.
That's why you will always see a difference in price among the exchanges but the gaps will close.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:39:40
Deal.  But 6k before that please.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:39:33
Be careful using coinmarketcap.  What it does is to use the "USD equilvalent" for a crypto/crypto trade with no cash involved.  So what is says as the "average USD price" is very misleading the the volume is hyper inflated.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:14:53
Lol ... f**k u guys.  Let's keep the game going.
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:39:25
Yes.  In my opinion, this is the root issue facing cryptos.
Most start with noble intentions.  Then the whales and exchanges hijack and use them as speculation vehicles.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:51:42
Still not happening.  You sure you doing your job correctly?
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:51:31
Cool ... Best of luck to you too :)
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:35:20
Simple - Bitfinex is not interested in your business.  Their customers are Chinese whales who are buying Tethers at huge discounts (since it cost nothing to print anyway).
That is why their disclaimer on non-redemption.  The whales don't redeem - they just use it to buy other cryptos (mostly BTC) and cash out through them.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:44:38
Why would anyone use cash to buy Tethers when it's terms and conditions clearly state that it's non-redeemable back to cash?
The only logical explanation is that Tethers are printed out of thin air and they don't want to honour any redemption for cash (which they don't have).  I.e., the only real users of Tethers is Bitfinex itself.
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:57:21
That's where debt restructuring comes in :P
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:18:58
Government's concern is the lack of regulation and it's alleged use for money laundering, public exposure to price manipulations, etc.  Get this into your head - Forex is a $5.3T per day market.  BTC is $6B (nobody even knows how much of it is whitewashed).  You think the bankers will bother with 0.1% of their business or that the 0.1% will change the world?  Sigh ...
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:27:43

@_date: 2018-03-25 07:17:17
Ok, I understand your logic.  So you feel that a substantial part of the trades will go directly to fiat/alt and bypass BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:54:37
Maybe we should ask the exchanges to pay dividends.  After all, they are the ones making the money.

Then why are we below 10k?  Poor cat is tired of bouncing.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:22:50
It doesn't say anything that we already know.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:06:37
Well, it's the people who trade that bring in liquidity and move the price.  Hodlers are irrelevant since they contribute nothing to price movement.  Next ATH (if it happens) will be built on the risks taken by traders.
I don't mean to be rude but to me, hodlers are just parasites hoping to gain big while traders are taking the risks.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:54:13
Crash is &gt;20% in a day.  No, we are nowhere near it.

I can sort of understand the lemmings argument.  
But why $12k?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:00:26
Given the volume during the 4 hours, I'm not sure if it's a dead cat bounce.  But whether the momentum will sustain or stagnate, it's anyone's guess.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:42:01
Just be patient and wait till it hits bottom.  That's when you will see strong volume pushing up the price.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:49:37
First, it is not new.  It has been there for at least 8 years (and that is a very, very long time in IT).
Second, the classic argument in every bubble - "it's different this time".
Look, I have been a big supporter but clear headed.  And I stood by what I have been saying - if BTC can't recover to it's pre-6k crash, it is very bleak.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:02:31
We are in bull trap period.  Just to break the silence, thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:09:15
Look at volume (a) during the selloff down to 6k, (b) the pump to 7k and (c) after 7k to now.  Now, go back in time and look at the same pattern during the 14k to 10k crash.  This is textbook pump and dump, and in between is the bull trap.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:58:47
What do you mean?  It bounced and is above 8k now.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:36:17

Don't say that.  It makes BTC sounds like a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:02:30
Where BTC will go is purely speculative.
Which brings me back to my original point - both traders and hodlers are speculating.  
Hodlers are long term speculators waiting for the moon, traders are quite happy to take the 10-15% profit on a regular basis.
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:46:18
I seriously think you place too much value in Reddit.
Oh well, do whatever you want with your life.
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:30:32
I have a theory (seriously).  I believe that a group of people got together, bought a huge chunk when it was cheap (&lt; $1k), manipulated the price to $20k (using Tether) and now, systematically selling it (again using Tether every now and then to pump up the price).  
I got no evidence so it's just a theory.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:49:32
True true.  I'm sure he will tweet soon that the 4% drop is fake news.

It is healthy to question but do so constructively.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:51:44
The only thing about cryptos that worry banks is their exposure when it crashes.  That's why they refuse to loan money (via credit cards) to buy them.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:17:19
And your basis for another "big run up"?  
Don't forget BTC's price is 100% speculative.  Which means, by Greater Fool theory, we need enough retards to pay increasingly higher price. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:48:50
Quite the opposite.  An economy flushed with surplus cash is good for bitcoin.  In fact, the prevailing theory is that 8 years of quantitative easing actually created the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:16:04

Not really.  It's actually arbitrage that sync prices across the exchanges.  These are done by bots, which are very efficient at spotting price gaps and closing them.  It can't possibly be done by humans as BTC is priced against a large number of currencies and other alts.

@_date: 2018-02-21 00:33:17
I kept telling you guys that watch carefully whether it will go above the pre-6k crash (11.8+).  If it doesn't, it's clearly manipulated as this is the 4th time it happens.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:27:48
Look again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:12:49

@_date: 2018-02-03 02:05:11

Banks pay you interest charge to use your money.  BTC does not.
Yes, there is disproportionate ownership of the world's wealth by a minority.  Rage all you want but BTC will not change that.  In fact, most of BTC is owned by the same group.
So what do you hope to change again?

You are still living in a fantasy world.
Since you want to use FB as an example, please tell me how many users of FB got rich by being a user?
BTC's real value is it's function as a currency.  Whether each BTC is worth $1 or $1m, it performs equally well.  There is no basis for BTC to increase in value even if adoption accelerates.
Let me give you a solid example to grill into your little head.  Mobile phone adoption sky rocketed.  Do you think an early adopter holding a Nokia candybar phone will make tons of money today by doing that?
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:52:19
It's been a month since the $6k crash and we have still not recovered to the pre-crash level (28/28 Jan - $11.8k)?
Any of you got any good guess/theory on this?  Would appreciate an intelligent opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:02:41
Here is another reason to hold off any buys -
STORM has overtaken USD and Tether as the top trading pair for BTC.  Tether trades is also bigger than USD and has been for some time already.  So think carefully if you want to put in your hard earned cash.
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:03:43
Simple answer - If you look at the high volume couple of days ago, these are probably the traders who bought at $6k-$7k.  33% profit within a weak is good.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:37:49
Why should they?  The whole idea of safe havens is to whether out the storm.  What you are describing is to jump out of the pan into the fire.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:43:33
Sorry but none of the above has an impact on price of BTC.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:09:41
Wow ... on this forum, most of what you have said is considered blasphemy :).
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:15:25
No - if it doesn't go pass 11.8k, it means it has not even recovered from the 6k crash.  
That is the scary part and also why I have not got back into the game (the other being the Tether issue).
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:13:39
Somehow I get the feeling that the hodlers are currently losing their pants and freaking out.
There really isn't any need for this negativity otherwise.

Hodling is just another form of speculation.  To suggest otherwise just stinks of hypocrisy.
 
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:33:30
First question is not correct.  In order for a currency to function, it must first be a viable store of value.  The most common store of value is of course money and gold.  The reasons why BTC has failed as a currency is well understood.  Which is why most proponents of BTC are emphasising that it's value is actually being a good store of value.  That is of course nonsense as the preservation of value is eventually to be used as a currency in the future.
And no, we are not in uncharted territory.  That's the most common argument during every known bubble and the underlying reason is actually denial.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:15:11
You guys are so full of conspiracies.  Can't you just take the opinion 'as is' and stop making conjectures?

Wait for the next crash to buy.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:07:18
Of course it's done.  That's precisely what stock is and yes, when it appreciates in price, it makes it harder for a company to buy it back.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:23:48
I'm Chinese.  CNY is sort of the unofficially year-end for traders and investors.  So this is the time when most of them will take profit to feel good and pump the money back in after CNY.  Please note that CNY is a 15-day celebration starting from 16 Feb.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:21:52
Considering that BTC/USD dropped 28% YTD, doesn't that mean the other cryptos have actually gained against BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:03:29
No, Central Banks and for that matter, most of the financial institutions, do NOT care much about BTC.  They have bigger issues to be concerned about such as inflation and the impact on the stock market.  You have been reading too much BTC advertisements or listening too much to BTC "Experts".

What the flying f**k.  Crashing again just barely 1.5 weeks from $6k crash.  And I thought this won't be happening till at least 5 days from now.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:23:47
Unfortunately, it is.  Actually, it's quite simple to tell by now.  Solid volume push to a certain level (7k), followed by low volume plateau (between 7k to 8k) - this is the bull trap period happening now before another crash.  
The last time this happened was when it was pushed to 10k, hovered for 2 weeks between 10k-12k (bull trap period), then followed by crash to 6k.
Edit:  I do not think this is natural.  It is too systematic and looks manipulated.  If I have to guess, this looks more and more like whales cashing out in a coordinated manner.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:40:09
No, the alts or rather, all cryptos fall/rise together because most of them are traded as pairs on the exchanges.

Because you are seeing only a small part of the picture.  GDAX USD is only 3% of the trades.  In fact, USD across all exchanges is less than 20%, smaller than Tether.

You must be delusional to compare BTC to Gold.  Gold is what gave fiat it's value and is kept as national reserves by governments.  BTC is just an electronic number currently used as a speculation tool.

I seriously don't think that Bitfinex, being a Hong Kong company, gives a shit about Uncle Sam.  They probably just ignored the subpoena.  This will be a long process - Interpol will have to step in as America has no jurisdiction.  Then ICAC will then have to investigate.  By the time it reaches a Hong Kong court for a warrant, Bitfinex would have shut down and ran off with the money.

Absolutely, the tech is great.  What is killing BTC is speculation and volatility.  Instead of being a great alternative to fiat, it has become a speculation market with zero governance and riddled with manipulation.  If there's a consensus on price (whether pegged to 20k or 5k USD), adoption will go off the charts.

Then you are contradicting yourself when you said "the dead cat is when it bounces up to 17k".  
And a 50% drop from ATH is not "a small dip".  Along the way, each crash was worse than the last.  This is a clear pattern of a deflating bubble.

Cycle seems to be repeating every two weeks, don't know the reason.  As to level where buyers willing to buy, it has unfortunately been dropping (maybe they are testing the bottom):

Volume is a good indicator but you need to see what happened to it.  If the volume is to support an up curve, it's good.  If the volume is to support a down curve, it's a sellout.  Look closely from ATH to now and you will see that the huge majority of the volumes are during down curves.  That's why we end up here in $7k territory.

Careful what you wish for.  At 10k, people are already nervous.  At 8k, more will panic sell.  If enough of them panic, it may crash even lower.  The only scenario that will fit your description is that there are more buyers than sellers at $8k, who in their exuberance, keep buying all the way up from $8k into ... whatever.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:43:12

I think you should look at the volume as it crashes down to 6k, bounce to 7k and ask yourself why has there been negligible trading after 7k.
Now, go wind back and look at volume when it crashed from 14k to 10k and thereafter.  Looks familiar?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:18:01
According to chart, there are more sellers than buyers.  And the buyers are patiently buying it down.  Who are they?  No idea ... may be people who bought low and taking profit, may be panic sellers cutting losses.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:52:28
Why did you say that the price dropped?  It's holding up pretty well at high 8k
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:01:36
If it does, it's more significant that you think.  It means that BTC has recovered above it's pre-6k crash (which it has not so far).

Guys, it's great to see the positive spirit and hello $10k!  It seems that many here have short memories and we need to keep ourselves grounded.  
Remember - we have had 4 crashes in the last 2+ months.  We have also not yet recovered fully from last crash ($11,750 down to $6,187).  
So trade carefully - don't get swayed by many who are overly bullish and there is no shame in taking profit if you ahead.  We are at a point where another crash or a spike are both likely to happen.
Stay safe.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:41:36

Don't hope for that.  A lot of investors don't understand the tech and are divesting among the top cryptos.  I.e., if they pull out, it won't be just BTC.  What we want solid adoption of a few top cryptos, led by BTC.

Tether is a Hong Kong company and is outside the jurisdiction of the American courts.  Yes, they can ignore the subpoena, which can then be used to trigger an investigation by Interpol.

When there's a downturn (which is now), investors move to safe havens like bonds and gold.  The last thing they will do is to move into volatile cryptos.  And you are half right in that cryptos started in 2008 as a product of the crisis.  But NOT in the way you think.  The remedy to the 2008 crisis was quantitative easing, which led to the economy being flooded with cheap money, which led to the crypto bubble.

@_date: 2018-02-10 14:29:24
Volume wise, I agree.  Support was very strong.  But we are discounting the possibility that prices are manipulated.  And with crashes at regular 2-week interval, is highly suspicious.  Not into conspiracy theories but the Tether issue really needs to get resolved.  I'm wary of sinking more funds until this is cleared off the table.

If BTC has a monopoly on the tech then yes - the 21 million BTC limitation is meaningful.  But when there are 1,300+ alts out there using the same technology, BTC's limited number means nothing.

Wait a bit.  If we see a period of low volume (doesn't matter the price), followed by sudden massive dump, followed by a short pump to set up the next bull trap ... then it's classic pump and dump.

More likely Up.  Simply because ownership is concentrated to a level where these owners can manipulate prices in an unregulated market.  But whether the rest of market can accept the price is another matter and that largely explains the downtrend from ATH.

"A few months" is a long time in BTC when you consider the fact that BTC was below $1k for years (since it was created).
It only started spiking in Mar last year so these "few months" is actually an abnormally.

And how much did Dutch Tulips cost before and after the bubble?  It took centuries for Gold to be accepted as a precious commodity, long before fiat was even created.  So if you are expecting the same level of acceptance, then you are truly delusional.  BTC is just an electronic number, nothing more.  Just like fiat, there is value when it's used as a currency, widespread adoption and commodities are priced against it.  By itself, it has little value.

To those who have been preaching "strong support at 11k, 10k, 9.5k, 9k, 8k ...", "buy the dip", ..... please stop.  None of us have any clue so stop the hyperbole as it will just encourage newbies to get burnt.  BTC is current in bear territory, no one knows what is the floor.  It may go back up, it may stay at 8K for months, it may crash.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:22:15

And what if it does not and instead crash to $6k or below?  There is no basis to believe that BTC will always recover and gain in price.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:39:39
No, I'm not concerned.  I'm just a little tired of the level of ignorance that is being propagated.  You are big on BTC not being controlled by governments but haven't you realised that the control of price has simply being passed on to the whales?  It's an unfair world we live in - the wealthy will always maintain control, one way or another.

Yes, there is.  Tether is a known issue but STORM is new.
The difference is - Upbit is regulated unlike Tether/Bitfinex.  So the chance of it being caught is high and when that happens, BTC price will crash hard.
Instead of being sarcastic, learn to be a bit more humble.  You might learn something new.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:32:09
Yes, that has always been the original intent but the greed and it's destabilising effect has destroyed that.

It may crash again to below $6k, around 15/16 Feb.  If it doesn't, I'm happy to stand corrected.  If it does, then you guys decide what you want to do; knowing that the price is manipulated.

Ever occurred to you that all of these are orchestrated to allow for whales to cash out regularly at the highest price possible?

Lol .... dude, it's been bear for months.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:45:50
I wish but that is untrue.  The crashes since ATH - $12.9k, $10k, $8.5k, $6k.  I would say that the both the rate and depth of crashes have increased.
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:26:17
Sub 9k is not low.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:55:40
We can also say that everyone who bought after ATH and before the last crash started on 4 Feb is sitting on a loss.  Don't you think a more acceptable definition of a bull is when prices have at least recovered and trending upwards?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:51:15

@_date: 2018-02-12 14:48:59
For pete's sake, just learn to read a simple chart.  Below the price, there is the volume.  Red means trade at lower last price, Green means otherwise.  Now, see those tiny Green volume during price increase and the huge Red during the down slope? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:57:29
Very likely but that's just my opinion.  Until the Tether issue is resolved, the prudent assumption is that pump (using Tether) and dump (cash out) will continue.

@_date: 2018-02-12 13:32:42
He's saying that the cycle repeated 20 days ago.  Actually, it's rather predictable by now.  Go back and look at the crash on 30 Dec ($12k), 17 Jan ($10k) and 2 Feb ($6k).  He's also predicting the next crash to happen on 15 Feb, which is the same as what I predicted.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:42:10
How did you derive $4k/$5k as "true price"?
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:45:51
You guys are missing the plot by focusing on the price.

Doesn't matter how much it's pumped to.  Every 2 weeks, there will be a massive dump.  Next one is mid Feb.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:15:38
There's no fight, just a difference in investment horizon.  Since BTC is a very volatile market, you have people who buy/sell by the hour, days (traders)... and those who are looking at much longer (years).  The latter are what we call the hodlers.  
We need both for BTC to prosper.  The traders provide the liquidity and the hodlers to bring some degree of stability.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:32:43
No idea, my friend.  But until we see solid volumes pumping up the price, it is definitely another bull trap.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:53:21
Well, we did not recover from the start of last crash - 11,621.
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:58:01
Very different groups of investors so I doubt there's a correlation.  
The closest link is that both are fuelled by the same QE that started at end of last 07/08 crisis.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:44:53
Eventually, it goes back to the old maxim - 'it takes money to make money'.  
If you have millions to invest, then yes - a 10-15% profit is good.
Otherwise, the only viable alternative is to wait for a 10x (or whatever) increase to reap the same profit.  That's why people HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:06:58
It's usually the other way round.  If BTC goes down 50%, the same amount of fiat can now buy twice the amount of the same alt using BTC.  This will push the fiat price of the alt downwards.  If the alt pushes back (i.e. market starts to price the alt higher), then the BTC/alt ratio will decrease.  At some point, new ratios for BTC/alt and alt/fiat will settle in.

@_date: 2018-02-06 13:28:46
True.  But you failed to mention that it's also an asset class that can drop 36% value in a week and 15% in a day, stagnated in value before 2013 and stagnated also between the 2013 and 2017 spikes.  That's a more balanced view.

@_date: 2018-02-08 05:11:36
On most exchanges, you can buy BTC with Tether.  The largest being Bitfinex, which has same owners as Tether.  The mechanism to pump up BTC in USD is not difficult if the allegation that Tether is not backed by USD is true.  (a) Generate Tether, (b) Use Tether to buy BTC using higher Tether/BTC than prevailing USD/BTC rate, (c) arbitrage will occur where people will buy BTC using USD and sell them for Tether at higher price.  Net result - USD/BTC price increases.

It's posts like yours that encourage weak hands to buy and possibly suffer later.  There is no rationale to support your claims that "it will shoot back up".   It may hover at this point for years, it may also crash.  The probability for any of these scenarios are unknown.

I agree.  In my opinion, those persuading others to HODL are doing it for a selfish reason - they are afraid of a more selling that brings down the price before they can sell themselves.  I haven't sold mine simply I'm still in the red (bought at 11.5), not because of some silly HODL strategy.

If you are really playing with serious money, stay out.
Nobody knows where this is going and at 8-9k, it's at the most dangerous point.  Either buy in when it crashes (6k might be good) and it's not too late to buy in at 10k if it starts trending up.
But if you want to listen to morons preaching 100k, it's up to you.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:54:28
It's easier to just use cash or VISA.  
BTC has failed as a currency and is too volatile to be a store of value compared to Gold.  Get over it.

@_date: 2018-02-22 19:20:23
The price of BTC for years before 2017 was about $1k.  So what has changed to justify a 10x to 20x increase?  Yes, the tech has improved but the improvements have not yielded tangible benefits to warrant such an increase.  
So anything above $1k is speculation price.  People are willing to pay the extra ($9k addition at this moment) simply because they think it might be speculated above this price.

You don't get it.  Russia will issue it's own coin and make cryptos with market-driven price illegal (which is probably all current cryptos including BTC).
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:39:35
The volume is still healthy, so it's a matter of time before either the sellers will saturate (price go up) or buyers will saturate (price go down).
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:52:11
Weight.  If there's high volume pushing the price up, then strong support is being built.  I.e. there are more buyers who will not be willing to later sell at a lower price.  On the contrary, if there's high volume pushing the price down, then there will be plenty of potential sellers waiting to take profit when the price recovers.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:24:52
I exited at 11.2.  Wrote off my loss.  This is appearing to be too orchestrated for my taste.

I do not think Elliot applies to BTC.  Elliot assumes a fair market where the collective action of the masses is dominant.  In BTC, ownership is concentrated to the extent where groups or even individuals have sufficient equity to influence prices.

Counterpoint - ATH - $20k.  
In both cases, hodlers made zero profit since they have been well, "hodling".

Really?  So what's the value and the basis for it's valuation?
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:07:33
Price of BTC did not increase in last 8 years because of adoption.  It increased because of speculation.  Unless you are suggesting that adoption grew 10x in 2013, went stagnant till 2017 and then went 10x again in 2017 and dropped by half in 2018.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:13:56
And BTC is based on wholesale manipulation like wash trades, unregulated exchanges and priced using a large number of alts that are scams at best such as Tethers.
Sorry, your point is?
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:03:14
Governments will continue to issue money regardless of whether BTC exist or not.  And if you even think BTC has any impact on their monetary decisions, then you are delusional.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:43:18
But how else will you expect prices to rise?  You need traders who are willing to buy/sell at a price that is higher than current price point.  Who do you think are the people who brought BTC to it's ATH?
If everyone hodl, that's the end of BTC.  Price will just stagnant and we go back into the dark ages.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:29:00
To be frank, either way is good for me.  If it crashes again, I can buy the dip.  If it doesn't, it gives me the opportunity to cash out my earlier buys (11.5k).
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:04:08
Here is an observation - When BTC price is rising or stagnant, trades using Tether &gt; trades using USD.  But when BTC price is dropping, it's the other way round.
My interpretation is that in a convoluted way, Tethers are being using to pump up/maintain BTC price and later cashed out in USD via BTC.  
Happy to stand corrected.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:24:36
It's all relative.  To me, "back" is when price recover to the point before the start of the 6k crash.  And that will be 11.8k+.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:14:14

Of course!  In fact, it will absolutely go to 50k, 100k, 500k, 1m!
In the process, it will also sink the USD, kill the banks, bring down governments, reattribute wealth and even the poorest owner of BTC will be driving a lambo.

Look at crash to 11.2k, 10k, 8.5k, 6k.  After each of these crashes, BTC did not recover to pre-crash value.  Only exception was on 7 Jan and it started crashing on same day.

@_date: 2018-03-17 02:55:32
It's more likely the other way round.  If price stagnates for too long, current owners will sell at a lower price and take their money elsewhere.
Time is important - BTC is not the only game in town and if there are more active and attractive investment opportunities, BTC volume will slow down and gradually drop in price.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:37:34
In the 80's where America's GDP is more than China and Japan, I agree.  Today, it's a multi-polar world and while a failed American economy is bad for everyone, it will not be a catastrophe.  It also doesn't help with Trump's policies, which has marginalised America's relevance to the rest of the world.

GS setting up a trading desk does not mean that it's investing or taking a position.  All it means is that it's a new revenue stream for them from commissions and fees.

Agree - my point is exactly that - new comers should not be looking for short term gains as most got burnt after the ATH.  Personally, I prefer that BTC be less volatile and remain stable (whatever that might be) for awhile.  If it does, it may again function as a proper currency and encourage adoption into mainstream rather than limited to speculators.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:04:17

@_date: 2018-02-01 00:36:00
No, that's the problem - buying at current price, holding or waiting for a dip.  If everyone here is doing just these, why should the price go up higher?  We need people to buy at gradually higher price if everyone is to gain.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:59:57
Very bad.  It's similar to USD/Oil.  Why do you think the Americans are fighting in the Middle East?  If OPEC countries start accepting other currencies, USD will tank so badly that inflation will kill the American economy.  Same for BTC/Alts.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:33:49
Well, there is a chance you get caught at a price which may not recover.  
Note that the last crash (to $6k) started on 28/29 Feb and till now, has NOT recovered to that price.  I cut my losses and exited at 11.2+ (bought at 11.5).

Good point but it won't be reflected in the price (which is largely driven by sentiments).  If price &lt; cost, then the miners will simply stop mining.  There is no other incentive built into the system other than the BTC mined.

Not sure, depends on the mechanism for resumption.  In stock market, most exchanges have trading curbs which acts as a circuit breaker to prevent market crashes.  The curb can last for as long as it takes for the market to cool down and rationalise an appropriate price point before resumption.  I think that's badly needed for volatile market like BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:56:48

It's an absurd argument.  On the one hand, we want a decentralised currency free of the financial intermediaries and control.  On the other hand, we are saying chargeback is a problem but that's a protection mechanism provided by the financial intermediaries.  You can't have both.
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:44:35
I didn't say it's important.  I said it might be useful.  UPS is exploring it's use for shipping, which makes sense given the large number of intermediaries involved.  Plenty of other use cases beyond cryptos.

In stocks, 10% is a correction and 20% is a crash.  As of yesterday, it is now officially a correction.  What made this correction unique is that it was a GOOD news that triggered it - a rise in American wages.  Wall Street doesn't like paying American workers more money.

I don't think it will go to 2k but given the high volume selling, there are plenty of reasons to see further price drops.  It's better to be prudent this time and not be overly bullish.
Let me share a sober data point - EVERYONE who bought between the 17 Dec ATH and 30 Jan are in the Red at this moment.  The only people who are making profit are those who bought during the 6K crash or before 30 Nov.

It's the other way round.  When your government reduce the money supply, it's to control inflation and the price of everything (including BTC) will drop.  Well, at least that's the theory.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:18:15
There are plenty of rationale to support a crash as well.  And I did not say it's random.  I said it's unknown.  As to adoption, my view is that blockchain will have a place in mainstream as more interesting use of it's tech are developed.  But this has nothing to do with the price of BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:32:47
What the heck are you talking bout?
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:09:32
And that's a government policy issue, which both BTC and fiat are subjected to the same risk.  Governments may just outright ban BTC overnight - that was precisely what Indonesia did.  
I'm sorry but while I agree there are issues with fiat, BTC is not the answer and as a currency, the support structure built to support fiat is still far superior to BTC.  Maybe this might change in the future but it's absolutely true for now.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:25:29
"Wall Street likes cheap btc, but they understand the risk / reward ratio"?  Lol ... Wall Street doesn't give a shit about BTC.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:35:39
Yes, only on hindsight.  You mean the regular pumping and dumping is not obvious by now?  
High Volume Dump on 30 Dec ($12k), High Volume Dump on 17 Jan ($10k), High Volume Dump on 2 Feb ($6k).
So we can prudently assume that dumping of BTC may occur around mid Feb.  No, I don't have any evidence other than the observations above so take it with a pinch of salt if you want.
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:38:39
Yeah right, I wish.
If it does, I make 2.3x in less than 24 hours.  Not going to happen.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:44:26
"Volume doesn't matter"?  
Damn!  Got to tell my friends manipulating the exchanges to stop their wash trading!
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:21:33
Lol .... with 1,300+ alts?  
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:48:48
I believe you are speaking for yourself.
Stop being so desperate.  BTC is not going to crash yet.  Still have a few bounces left.
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:07:24
In all seriousness, I agree with you.
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:49:36
A Titanic that can bounce back.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:02:11

Shortage = What you owe when you sell short
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:03:17
Can go either way.  It is true that since ATH, each dive has gone deeper and each recovery after that is also lower.  You don't need TA to see that.  But of course, the trend might change but other than noise, I have not seen any reason to support this.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:05:36
Do you know the difference between investing in an exchange and earning fees and "institutional money coming into the market"?
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:59:42
Ah ... another sign of the desperate justifying a deflating bubble.
"Don't look at TODAY!  Look into the FUTURE!"
It's a variation of:
"Look at the price on the way up the peak of the bubble!!"
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:49:18
Lol ..... blockchain has been replicated literarily to over a thousand alts so if that's your preposition, it's pretty silly.  
And scarcity means nothing if there's no demand.  I can safely bet that there's less than 16M Beanie Babies out there.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:56:57
I'm actually hoping that it will reach at least 9k to make it worth my time.
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:25:28
Dude, the only people entering the market are newbie investors due to FOMO.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:39:11
Based on history, it will crash and bounce up.  Happens every time BTC's price hovers for a while.
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:40:56
Dumb and Dumber
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:28:44
The other possibility is that the cryptos we know today will be dusted to the bins of history and great-grandchildren can tell stories of how stupid you were.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:08:40
BTC's price is artificially controlled.

Hodl'ing does shit.

If he shorted that yesterday, he's a very rich man now.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:16:03
Wrong.  Again, there is no free lunch.
What he is doing is accumulating budget deficits to benefit mostly the corporates and the rich (you get the scraps).  
This deficit is shared by all Americans and you will soon see your social security and medical benefits being reformed.  In other words, the 99% will be holding the shitcan in future while the corporates and rich profit now.
Got it moron?
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:03:39
Actually, he is insisting that only good news be posted here.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:09:50

Well, says quite a lot.  Dude, the world is really a lot bigger and more complex.  And not everyone you know is a cousin, brother or sister.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:21:39
Lol .... Mexicans?  That's the distraction and bogeyman.
I give Trump credit for his intelligence.  It's the 99% that's being conned and still don't realize it.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:28:17
First, we had this wunderbaah crazy pants and now, a conspiracy nut case.  
Hugely entertaining forum .... sigh.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:27:01
What upwards trend?  You noticed that each 'peak' after the crashes are getting lower and lower?
I frankly don't expect higher than 9,000 before it starts crashing again.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:19:20
It says $200 in 2012.
Sorry, no sympathy for anyone buying all sort of shit coins hoping to make easy money.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:36:22
Crashed past 6,700
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:24:23
Do YOU understand crypto and the current prices?
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:30:58
They won't.  Period.  
It's an instrument of fiscal policy, which the fools here will not understand.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:30:06
Dude, we are not even on the same page.  Blockchain is a fabulous tech and there are already plenty of use cases - check out UPS.
But saying that there's institutional money coming into BTC is a very, very different thing.
Also, I work in the banking industry so let's drop the "financial institutions are smarter" bit.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:30:04
But there is merit to his point.
All the tech is useless unless it delivers value.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:55:38
Same :). 
But I took the longer route of seeing it go down to 6,442 and bought the rest when it went up to 6,500.
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:05:15
Ah!  This is where Game theory comes in.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:20:03
Really?  Then maybe I should start dumping now
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:23:31
More conspiracy BS ...
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:54:38
Interesting perspective
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:09:36
I would love to see the short sellers get burnt to crisp.
Never liked them ... parasites.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:45:07
Maybe people just feel like paying more?
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:11:06
Go fuck yourself.  This was funny, now it is irritating.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:03:26
Agree but this quality is only of value if it's widely accepted for trade and at this point in time, it is not.  Furthermore, it is diluted by the fact that it's not unique to BTC as the underlying tech is open sourced and can be forked.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:44:25
A better world is one where people put in the sweat and hours to make it better.  
BTC is not a utopia.  It will make a few rich and it will be built on the misery of many, many others.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:21:00
It's already old news and priced in.
Unless Trump responds and make it worse.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:44:52
China is just sending a message, not create real damage and escalate the trade war.
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:50:54
Yes, it is still too high and will crash soon.  This hover can't last forever.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:57:46
The shorter benefits from a downturn and the long, the opposite.
if you can't even tell the difference between the two, then you are a moron.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:53:58
Because it's really not significant.  
It's just a digital token and the only reason for the all the attention is that it's currently in a bubble with inflated prices.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:23:42
I think quite a number are already in the Fear stage.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:17:40
Volume tapering down on bitfinex .... maybe we will see some movement soon.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:57:44
Recover to?
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:40:17
Sorry, must have been Fake News.  And Jeff Bezos.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:15:49
Aren't you the one buying all the shitcoins?
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:25:35
Well, each time the price plateau and volume decline, the next thing is a crash.  
My reading is that there just isn't enough new money to push it up.  So the only time price goes up is after a crash when people buy the dip.
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:05:40
Good night guys, been a long day for me.  
I did my little part to help push the price up :)
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:43:56
Whenever BTC's price hovers, it usually crash but will bounce up.  
At least that's what happened in the past.  Remember those time when everyone was complaining that it hovered at 11k before plunging to 6k?
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:29:58
He's probably just bored.  Nothing much happening where he lives.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:57:56
I'm wearing only my shorts and topless.
And I will continue to do that till it reaches 9k.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:39:38
Silver and Gold hold their prices because they are accepted as precious commodities and held in reserves by governments.
BTC is a digital token that is nothing but an entry in an electronic ledger.  Similar tokens have been forked or using other technologies resulting in over 1,000 alts.
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:58:51
Interesting.  But short sellers are more often right than wrong.  At least in stock market, not sure about cryptos.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:09:53
Another conspiracy nut case.
Why would "they" want to do that when the bulk of BTC is in their possession anyway?
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:37:59
Busy buying of course
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:23:24
Fuck you.  If you want to make wild claims, show the evidence instead of asking others to do research.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:29:52
Yeap, looks that way.  
But huge blocks building up from 6,750 downwards on bitfinex.  This will be interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:20:44
You can still buy one of those old monitor that shows everything in green.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:23:41
I'm quite amused with some of the people who responded to you.
So naive and judgemental - "he's old, "he doesn't know", etc.  As if any of us understand this any better.   
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:39:51
It is not bouncing.  It is hovering within a narrow band.  So expect a crash and bounce up.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:09:02
RUBBISH!  
I'm holding till 9K.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:24:40
Which exchange u using dude?  It's at 6,494 on bitfinex :)
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:08:09
They are far more people who bought way before the ATH.
Don't believe?  Go look at the top wallets and see their history.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:42:33
Yes.  But don't worry your pretty head ... it will crash again in a month.  Seems to be a repeating trend.
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:31:49
BTC advocates love to (mis)use the Lindy Effect.
Where BTC is concerned, it's not the fact that is it indestructible that matters but rather, acceptance as a long-term store of value (which it has not).  Store of value, yes.  Long term?  That's a joke.
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:56:43
It's already below 6700 on bitfinex
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:32:28
The ONLY accomplishment is that it's price is speculated higher than anyone expected and it's now crashing slowly like a deflating balloon.  
That's a fact that people here are experiencing and understand.
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:21:39
Did I ever said it was a lambo?  
Sigh .... kid, go focus on getting yourself laid.  It's what a healthy, growing up moron should do.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:44:06
When it's crashing every month?
No thanks.  I rather cash in and buy back at next month's crash.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:29:10
Zzzz ..... I'm tired of seeing this 69xx - 71xx.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:40:38
BTC may not even survive as an item of interest beyond this year.
That's a possibility that can't be ignored.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:51:33
Lol ... I very much doubt so :)
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:39:09
But it is real and unique to BTC.  No other asset in this world has such a high concentration of ownership.  Add to this the unregulated exchanges and you get wholesale price manipulation.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:27:08
You comparing a digital token with FB and Walmart?
FB generated $15B profit for it's shareholders and Walmart generated $13B.
BTC?  $0
So anyone paying more than $1 for BTC is overpaying.  The only reason why it's priced more than that is pure speculation based on the belief that it may be worth more in future.
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:01:29
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:08:15
The best news so far - BTC survived the death cross
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:17:35
Yeah right, comparing a digital token with gold.  Sure, whatever.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:04:32
If you would only spend a little more time discerning facts from his hyperbole tweets.  Make no mistake - Trump is just feeding you some scraps to make you feel good. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:41:11
Because most of them believe that BTC is just a bubble, simple as that.
In the meantime, if they can make money providing more ropes for you to hang yourself and charge a fee, it's good business.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:52:24
Dude, it's all a charade.  
You won't find a more pro-elite POTUS in history.  The 99% of the sheeps supporting him are retards.

Your car is not unique.  If there are enough people with similar cars selling it for $100k, then your car is worth $100k (well done).  But if there are enough people selling it for $1k, then your car is worth $1k.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:15:29
2 spikes - 2013 and 2017.  Downtrend since 2017 ATH.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:01:06
It's low volume on bitfinex.
Anyway, I'm going to get busy buying down to 6k.
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:02:41
ah .... the crazy pants is here.
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:34:15
By which time, price would have crashed and FOMO subsided and BTC will be irrelevant because it will be replaced by alts that are acceptable and regulated by governments.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:52:56
You have been duped.  Trump is doing everything other than what he says and pretend to be.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:17:34
I have seen it, you moron.
Like I said - Tech companies and coin peddlers.  
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:37:32
I'm tired of hearing all these repeated stupid responses like "owned by exchanges".  How many exchanges are there out there?
As for newly mined coins - 1,800 per day Vs 700,000 traded.  That's 0.25%.  Don't want to sell?  Fine - 0.25% doesn't move the needle.
Next time you want to come up with a wacko idea, do the maths first.
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:12:40
Honestly?  
Dude, this is just a guessing game where everyone is just betting on a hunch.
BTC has no intrinsic value (or one that people agree on) and therefore, there is NO floor.  For the same reason, BTC has NO ceiling either because all you need is enough people to buy at whatever price.
For me, I took a big bet on 6.5 but I'm not going to hold my breath for a 10x increase.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:03:11
They factored in a drop of 20% after accepting BTC :P
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:11:05
Haha ... that's really funny coming from someone trying to finance his lambo to a another who's driving a 488 :)
@_date: 2018-04-02 08:24:17
Only those hoping to make money from speculation will lose interest.  BTC was working fine as a currency before all these spikes.
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:38:40
Not so sure mate.  It's been this way for 2 days already.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:30:57

@_date: 2018-04-01 14:26:41

@_date: 2018-04-02 08:23:21
Yes.  I have said many times - you cannot have volatile price and adoption at the same time.  
Of course the day dreamers will want both.
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:21:46
Finally going down on bitfinex ....
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:21:18
Sorry mate.  Just very tired of people preaching that BTC is digital gold, safe haven, destroyer of governments and banks, target of cartels, etc.
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:56:27
The price will not go up unless there is trading and people buy at increasingly higher price.  
Gosh ...... do you guys even have an ounce of common sense?
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:48:39
Really?  The last guy told me it's going to go back down to $6k very quickly.
So who should I believe?
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:17:07
China did not start the trade war, Trump did.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:58:20
Yes, 90% is big money.  But don't confuse that with Institutional money to attempt to give some credibility to BTC.  
Consensus?  That's a tech event on blockchain.  Sponsors?  Mostly tech companies and a few coin peddlers.  Sorry, no "Institutional Money" sponsors.
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:04:12
You are so full of shit.
We buy long when the investment has good potential and help to push the price up.  We sell not always because there's a downturn but to take profit off the table.
Short sellers - nothing but scum bags that live off the misery of others.  That's the only way they live.
You may think there's no difference from a technical perspective.  But where principles are concerned, short sellers are nothing but the rodents that feed on shit.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:33:39
Ask yourself what is BTC intended for (other than speculation) and you will have the answer - it's a failure.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:25:23
Don't give me the "BTC is valuable because it is scarce" bullshit
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:47:50
Hey moron, if a full scale trade war starts, everyone will be running to the hills.  
Money will go to safe havens like gold, bonds, TB or saving accounts. 
 WE with vestments in cryptos will be fucked royal.
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:16:46
Cartel is pure BS.  Totally unsubstantiated.
The truth is - BTC was created and is managed by aliens.  Their goal is to make BTC the global currency and have everyone tattoo their BTC address on their hands and forehead.
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:00:40
damn it ... stop getting me mixed up with that moron
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:29:22
Well, I'm not altogether convinced that trading (for goods and services) is happening right now.  I would love to see some reliable charts on this.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:03:58
You do realize that I'm in agreement with you that hodl does not help the situation?

It's going to go down.

Won't happen until the price speculation and manipulation dies out.
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:06:09
If keep repeating baloney like "institutional money", BTC will be discredited as being owned by looneys.  
So do us a favour and stop making these wild statements.
