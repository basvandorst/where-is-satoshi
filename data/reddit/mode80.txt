I like it this, except for the part about "tech priests".  If I didn't know what he was talking about that would make me nervous. I suppose it makes me nervous even though I do.

I like the idea of this but it there are many ways to turn a passphrase into a private key, and none of them are considered to be "the" way. 
On my deathbed, I'd like to be able to whisper my passphrase to a loved one and for that to be enough. As it stands, I'd also have to explain to them the algorithm I used to convert my passphrase to a private key, which might be... inconvenient. 
It's almost a bit dangerous that people might be using something like bitcointools for this. What happens when they're ready to access their coins 10 years from now and bitcointools is a 404 page? What good is their perfectly memorized passphrase then? 
If there is such a thing as a "most obvious" algorithm, I'd like to know what it is.

I've not played the game. I thought it was cool that they prominently display bitcoin as a payment option.

This is true. Tradehill is least likely to screw it up imho

Running a correlation analysis on the OP's data, the so called r-squared is 0.28. You can interpret this to mean that 28% of the variation of one "goes along with" variation in the other. You can't assume google searches drive the price. It may be that price drives google searches, or some 3rd variable that influences them both (e.g. news coverage). 
Math hat off, I think it's reasonable to guess that it's mostly news coverage driving them both. What's interesting is that most of the news in the last few months has been overwhelmingly negative. I guess there's no such thing as bad publicity.
