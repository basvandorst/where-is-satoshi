I got in crypto in July '17. btc went down from 2500 to 1800 a 33% decrease back then about the same as it is now. I'm not saying it will ~10x  as it did since 6 months period, but it should at least 2.5x in a few months. Crypto mining in mass is back now after ethereum crash of august so we will see a lot of hype in the next few months which will drive prices considerably up

a bot is an application/software that buys or sells based on different predefined instructions instantly like no human could by clicking with mouse. Most common behavior is when they fill 5-10 orders instantly of something like 0.001 btc to clear the previous "red" history and create "green" hype and vice versa when they want to lower the price. Other times they put buy or sell walls of 10-15 btc and remove the order as soon as someone buys more than 2-3 BTC of their order. Also they put buy walls and trick people into thinking that demand is high and it's good time to buy when they actually dump their btc and vice versa putting big sell walls and make people believe that price is about to go down when the bot actually buys everything at low steady price. Also they are very good at predicting the market short term and buy or sell at the right time. Some bots may detect good or bad news from social media and different crypto news and trade accordingly. There are probably many other tricks that they do that i'm not aware of.

S9 was $2100 before last summer. now it's $3900 + $200 power supply. I wouldn't get into mining for this reason alone. Difficulty has increased considerably since then, meaning you'll get much lower prifits nowadays. the miner itself is very loud and i heard customer service is pretty bad.

In August '17 it went from $2700 to $1800, about the same percentage decrease as today. If i only new it would reach $19.5k all times high half a year later or had bigger balls back then, i'd be rich now.

major exchanges won't let tether crash and will back it up, maybe not all but some of it with real fiat if needed. Not only bitfinex backs up tether, there are rumors of coinbase backing tether as well. Probably other exchanges do the same. If tether crashes, all the crypto market crashes and exchanges would loose 80-90% of trading volume for the next 1-2 years, meaning 80-90% less profits. Coinbase alone currently makes close to $3 million a day in fees.

market cap is price of crypto times total supply. It's not total worth, you can't pull out $173 billion from btc's current market cap if let's say everyone would want to abandon it. theoretically, on Gdax price of BTC would currently go down to $5k  if only 13000 bitcoin were sold at once. ($100 mil out ) In practice the price would go a lot lower because every single stop loss order would be triggered. Gdax is a big exchange. a few more hundred millions pulled out from other exchanges and market cap of btc would go down to theoretical 1/2 of current 173 billion. or in practice probably crash to a few millions. Something similar with a lot less money pulled out happened to Ethereum when price went down briefly a few cents from ~$300 last summer.
No one would ever dump so much cryptocurrency at once, usually investors with millions/billions worth of crypto sell directly to other investors without the market being affected.

This was very well orchestrated. They bought thousands of bitcoins at $5800+ waited for someone to dump a big amount, joined them and dumped hard. The impressive part is that they didn't even need to sell the accumulated bitcoin at a loss to profit from shorting. Nicely done.

if blockchain transactions change to 1-2 seconds in the future and merchants start adopting crypto in mass then none of the points you mentioned would matter. google and facebook would be all over it. I actually think they did the right thing and did the crypto market a favor. At the time they stopped advertizing crypto, the shit and scam coins were being created at an alarming rate and a lot more people would have lost a lot more money on overly hyped and wortless junk.

He just stated the obvious and i think he is one of the very few decent pioneers in the crypto comunity that shares real information.

So when is the next crash coming? It dropped from $20k to $6.5k like a rock before. I don't believe that the current support at $6k is natural. 
When exchanges claim of being hacked, like the recent hack event which is a lie, it means their price manipulations took a wrong turn and they suffered big losses.
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:25:31
wow, i can't believe this should even be debated. They are a great investment vehicle.
rent = money gone down the drain. own = build equity over time. 
The misconception that you should buy a house and live your entire life in it is wrong. You don't even have to live one day in it, you can move out whenever you desire and rent it or sell it and buy something else. If you rent it the money you get should cover the other area you want to live in. Same goes for loosing a job.   
Paying for rent when you have the option to buy a home is financially stupid. Selling a home and rent instead for the rest of your life is even more so.
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:05:42
Can you explain why are you confident in the longterm? Maybe i'm missing something. In a few years the argument "blockchain is still new, needs more time to develop" won't work anymore like it did in 2017.
The blockchain itself is getting worse performance year after year since it's inception. 
Also Lightning network might be a bust or may only be efficient for big sums of btc where opening closing a channel cost won't matter. 
No doubt BTC will surpass the $20k ATH in 1-5 years, but i'm not sure it will be able to sustain it and not fall back.

the current support is fake, made by exchanges, whales and mining tycoons. The last bull run to $20k was because of hyped regular investors who are nowhere to be seen now. Very often you can see the bots turning off for trading algorithm adjustment purposes and the exchanges are almost dead for a few minutes. 
How long can they keep the fake support? It could be for years or it could end tomorrow. No one knows but them.

real walls created by real traders of course. Fake walls not. Months ago when i'd see this massive buy and sell walls and thousands of bitcoins traded in 5 minutes my heart rate would double and almost instantly i'd hit the buy or sell button which most of the time was a wrong move. Many beginner traders feel the same way probably, but can't help it and repeat the same mistake over and over again. Exchanges profit the most from people like this.

I can assure you, there is less than 0.0001% of people that bought btc in 2012 and never sold it until 2017/18. Also most of the investors who bought bitcoins in 2012 lost them in Mt.Gox.
Ok, let me rephrase it, what do you think is the % of all the profits and loses of crypto investors that ever bought crypto up until now. Is it 50/50% less, or more? What will be the % in 10 or more years?
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:09:18
Altcoin creators own roughly 20% of all altcoins without investing a penny. Half of them are scams and most of them are incompetent. When crypto market hit almost $1 trillion market cap this guys pulled out a lot of money and never invested them back like traditional traders do. They continuously pull cash out to this day no matter where price is going and they still got a lot left to cash out
@_date: 2018-09-15 10:45:31
you misunderstood the idea. Tell me if up until now or in 10, 20, 50, 100 years there will be more people profiting than losing money in crypto considering all those previously mentioned factors that eat up a considerable chunk of value from it.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:16:15
BTC always dictates the price of other altcoins with very few exceptions for example when an altcoin has some great news. Many times exchanges themselves add fake buy/sell walls to let the traders know where the market is going.

fud troll, haha ))) Mt.Gox claimed it was hacked. Look into it. They bought over 800k bitcoins with "borrowed" money and when they couldn't sell them at higher price but instead took to many losses they got "hacked" They were accounted for at least 95% of the trading volume at the time. 
The "hacks" that followed after where no different but on a smaller scale.

Stop loss helps avoid losses. Hodling only works in a bull market. You are doing it wrong if you have a different approach.

This hidden orders on Bitfinex seem very unnatural. There is little trading volume happening then out of nowhere a buy and sell wall appears from and buys/sells thousands of bitcoins in a matter of minutes. It could be just bitfinex faking it. There are multiple profit benefits for them to do so, to name a few, the "increased" trading volume compared to other exchanges which keeps it's top spot in terms of marketing and also multiple regular traders starting panicking and fomo which creates real trading volume and profits. A stable price of BTC and low trading volume is the worst enemy of exchanges.

that's silly. Why pay let's say $1000 rent rather than paying $1500 mortgage? Renting for 30 years will get you nothing. Paying mortgage will get you equity. Can't afford to pay mortgage anymore? Rent it to someone else and move to a cheaper place. The money you get for renting your home will cover most of your mortgage. Oh and let's say in 15 or 20 years you think rent will still be $1000 for you? absolutely no, more like $4000+ but your mortgage payments would have stayed the same $1500 and your salary and home value would have ~doubled. You could have done so many other things to cover your debt.

If gates would have shorted Tether would have eaten all his bets. Exchanges have all the data about what stop losses users place, what limit buys/sell are and what shorting bets are placed. It's easy to counteract those when you have a fake money tool like tether. When it's an insignificant loss for them, micro crashes in prices are even beneficial for exchanges because it double/triples trading volume and fees that are associated with those

Blockchain is great, but a little overpriced for what it offers. It almost lost it's peer to peer functionality while moving towards centralization and it's vastly outdated. In the early days if someone let's say used bitcoin 10 times and payed transaction fees he/she could mine it on an old laptop for a day or two and get those fees back. Ideally it should have stayed like this forever, but nowadays the option of getting the spent transaction fees back through mining on a cheap PC is gone forever.

Bitmain is doing 2.66x worse than bitcoin.
If price keeps holding at $6k range for 2-3 years, i think the antminer s9 may be found for pennies. No one knows if BTC price will ever surpass let's say $10k and if it won't bitmain is doomed. They know that and that's the reason for the IPO, so they can spend people's money for poking at new technologies. AI and Machine learning is not at all efficient with Asic considering the software development time and cost required to work with Asics and if you update/change the software, new asic hardware is needed. AI and machine learning needs 100X+ faster and bigger storage capacity. Processing power is of a second importance. Even if Bitmain succeds at developing asics for AI and machine learning, their revenue won't be near the &gt;$2bn mark considering the global server revenue is $18.6billion. For every 10th server = 1 asic globally won't ever happen.

new nm size don't just develop overnight. They reached their peak performance so i don't think they can develop new more powerful mining hardware in at least 3 years. Also no more fools will believe anytime soon youtubers and shills for a constant, stable profit in crypto mining so even if BTC price goes back to $20000 now the Antminer s9 won't cost even $1000 let alone $4500+  They can't build anything else besides mining hardware at the moment and the promise for skyrocket AI and machine learning future profits is baseless. The baseless promise and the $18bln IPO they got through hype is very similar to shitcoin ICOs. 
It's just my opinion, you don't have to agree with it.

Criminals can buy stolen credit/debit card data in bulk on black market. Spending money online on goods with those can leave traces. Buying crypto with those without extra security measures like id or passport would be somewhat untraceable. 200 worth to buy from one card you ask. Imagine 10000 cards buying 200 worth? Crypto exchanges don't want this kind of business.

Stocks, crypto are doing well only when global economy is doing well and people have savings to play around with. Stock market crash usually means job layouts in mass, people loosing homes, savings, not only in US, but globally.  
Everyone loves to bring up Venezuela example in such debates, but fails to realize that Venezuela's economy crash didn't affect global economy or people's savings around the world. If i lived in a 3rd world country i'd rather invest all my savings in US dollar or Euro rather than crypto. Even though the last economy crash affected US dollar value it affected the rest of the world currencies even more.
I believe we got about 2 more years to go before another US/Global economy crash.

Loosing crypto is not always related to criminal activity. A wallet developer could mess up people's funds (remember 300k eth loss?), an exchange might steal your funds and say "we were hacked". People's hardware failing and with it the crypto, people forgetting passwords, people getting hacked or scammed, people sending crypto to wrong address. None of these losses are covered by a central authority like a fiat loss would. 
I've read enough promises from developers and shill posts but i like to evaluate also real results which are ridiculously low compared to the money that has been poured in. 
By dead end i mean the scalability issue. I've read enough i formation to understand that even lightning network won't solve it and other solutions that could appear in the future will all be centralized which defeats the crypto ideology and adds another security risk. 
Code can't always be added, why do you think Bcash was created? Different blockchains also operate on different algorithms so new developments can't be interchangeable with other altcoins. 
I stand by my argument that crypto is not "revolutionary" anymore, a term that is overly hyped in crypto community without any basis.

In a bear market when multiple fake sell orders are placed and are canceled when they meet buying resistance it means that whales sold most of their crypto long ago and try to crash the market further with other traders hands so they can buy cheaper later. If they sell it all at once they can't manipulate the crash further and risk selling too much in case price suddenly goes the other way. I believe they always bounce their portfolio around 30% crypto 70% fiat in a bear market and vice versa in a bull market

"Revolutionary" means something new that doesn't have any competitors for a long time or indefinitely because of the inability of others to compete. For example Tesla, Spacex were and still are revolutionary. The  "revolutionary" title ends when multiple competitors appear and often do better. Iphone for example is not revolutionary anymore. 
1500+ shitcoins are a reason to believe that bitcoin is not revolutionary anymore. Crypto in general in comparison to fiat may be revolutionary one day, or it may be not. Time will tell.

Best way to invest is when you don't listen to reddit shill or fud posts but filter, detect and evaluate quality information, know what impact on price some news might have, never buy high and always sell high even if you have to wait for months without a single order placed.

"where huge resources are being applied to keep the price supressed" i don't think so, look at the unusually low trading volume this past few weeks. Most of the 2017 crypto investors bought the hype at $12k+ price and market needs time for the new wave of noobs to build strong support

There is a limit to everything. Years ago a very small percentage of people knew about and believed in bitcoin and there was not much media coverage about it. In 2017 the whole world boomed about crypto. Anywhere you'd go or any social media site you'd visit had crypto in your face daily. Any potential investor who had savings, invested in crypto but now there are not many of those left. People's savings have a limit too. Most of those people who bought at $15k+ which is a very large number of holders pray nowadays for the price to reach $15-20k again so they can sell asap without a loss. It will be very hard for whales to pump the price back to $20k because of it. Maybe in a few years $20k price could be real, but very unlikely anytime soon.
Don't forget also that bitcoin miners alone were payed $36 million daily out of crypto market when price reached $20k. ICOs were cashing out hundreds of millions $ worth of btc and eth during the hype and they still got a lot of it left to dump nowadays.  Consider also major crypto markets like China, India banning crypto, all United States banks banning crypto purchases with credit cards, facebook, twitter crypto ban.  
All things considered I'm surprised that price is currently sustained at $6k+ by whales.Those have limited resources as well and can't do it forever.

At current price btc miners alone make $16mil daily, meaning investors must pour into market $16mil daily just to keep the price flat. At $20k miners were getting $36mil daily. At $300k = $0.5 billion daily which i don't think it's possible even if all the world gets into crypto.

$800 is too low, i think it's real value is around $2000-$2500 and the rest is being inflated by tether, exchanges and whales. Keeping bitcoin inflated is a good business for many reasons, primarily trading volume/fees and volatility/profits but i'm not sure for how long they can keep it this way without investing too much. 
BTC at the peak of it's hype dropped from $20k to $6k without a sweat then bounced to $13k. In comparison seeing nowadays such strong support at ~$6k is unnatural. Also btc mining hardware demand dropped almost 10 times while btc dropped only 2.6 times. I know that this is not the best metric, but such discrepancy between the two is suspicious to say the least.

Bitmain reported close to $4 billion profit in 2017,  $1 bln more than Nvidia. Coinbase made $1 bln. All the miners, whales and regular people combined made a lot less profits than just Bitmain and Coinbase. Don't forget about the 1500+ shitcoins which 99% are long term scams and are salivating over people's money.

Bitcoin is a currency, it's price matters. For example if price will go continuously down for a long time or whales won't stop reaping most of the profits with their pumps and dumps there would be no one to invest in it and use it daily at some point even if blockchain was perfect.

It will go lower than 6k for the next dip, otherwise whales don't make much money and it's bad business for them. If it dropped from 20k, 13k, 12k to 6k multiple times with a lot more support back then it should drop lower from the recent 10k high.
Market needs at least a year to recover from the losses of people buying 2-3x overpriced crypto and mining hardware (Oct-Dec '17). There are a lot of issues with the crypto currently, scalability being one that might take a while to solve so the price of crypto will be boring for a while.
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:50:43
Internet created trillion dollars industries and hundreds of millions jobs. Crypto created the blockchain which is highly debatable in it's efficiency and cost and also a volatile currency from which whales and exchanges are the most beneficiaries. 
Just like i said before, there are very few exceptions in which fiat is limited and those very few exceptions is where crypto will succeed. It's a niche market, nothing more.
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:48:31
until they are solved, i'm skeptical and cautious.

At $20k Miners of BTC alone were making $36 mil. a day meaning investors had to buy $36 mil worth of btc everyday just to keep price flat. Take into consideration China, India ban, credit cards ban in US nowadays. Hard to believe price will reach $20k soon. Maybe close to 2020 when halvening will happen
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:31:33

A good portion of btc and altcoins is held by it's creators and mining cartels who invest zero fiat in crypto, another considerable portion is held by early adopters with big pockets who invested actual money in it. I'm not ok with a new global monetary system that would be controlled by this very few people and neither should you. 
It would make them all billionaires or more out of nothing. Crypto is a business in it's nature, not a "decentrilized" currency like many of us peasants hype it. It has decentrilized properties but in general it's not. 
Also don't forget that most of the people are in crypto to make a profit. If people can't make a profit but make losses instead, crypto is forgotten quickly. No one really cares in general about crypto's ability as a currency because fiat is doing just fine, actually much better in terms of cost and security with very few exceptions compared to crypto. Those very few exceptions is where crypto is great at and it should be further developed.

Yea those were buying because they had money, the rest of people didn't. For example you could buy a 2 bedroom house in Miami for $50k+ which was dirt cheap, but no one was buying because not many had any savings for the next 3 years. Same house is worth $250k+ nowadays.

Taking google statistics into consideration people buy a lot more pricey crypto during the pump because of the hype and those new investors usually don't sell at all time high because of the greed. A lot of them then sell at all time low because of fear. It took 4 years for the price to come back to $1000 since 2013 - early 2017. You think all those people held crypto for 4 years? If let's say someone held for 3 years then sold, wasn't that a long enough long term holder for you?

Lower your voice, my ear is ringing :) Of course it does. Money that you donate are not taxed. Money that a non-profit charitable organization receives are not taxed. Gates, Zuckerberg and others created such charitable organizations under their names, so can anyone else with considerable amount of money. They can't spent those money as usual, but they can donate those money for all kinds of favors in return, including cash back or partial transfer to an offshore account.

"all kept secure" you mean like the 4+ million btc that are lost forever? Or Mt.gox falsifying 90% of trading volume with fake money and then blaming hackers after realizing the shitstorm they created, or mining cartels that twisted developers arms for as long as they could to keep the blockchain inefficient and mining profitable for as long as they could. Or Bcash spamming bitcoin's network so the transaction time and fees are kept high. 
The shitcoins are created with the sole purpose of making it's creators rich. Until i see any "revolutionary" results from any of them i believe they are all copycats and hit a development dead-end. I also don't think you can use bits from one crypto to another without forking the later.

Bitcoin will always be the dominating force, no altcoin will ever come close. Trading volume on Gdax decreased from ~50-100k btc daily from last november to ~5-10k btc nowadays. Google search for "bitcoin" is the lowest since may 2017. 
Seems whales dumped on the $15k+ btc  noobs and holders pretty hard and the market needs some time for a new wave of noobs to come play crypto.

I'm in crypto to make money, just like 99% of people supporting it are, but i'm not ok with disinformation and false hype. It's bad for everyone and benefits only whales and exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:28:39
when global economy fails, all the corporations loose money and lay out workers, medium and small size businesses fail, people loose homes and savings. Who will buy crypto and sustain it's high price when no one has money to buy crypto? On the contrary, those who have crypto in such times, would sell everything to make the ends meet. For example you could buy 2bd house in Miami in 2010 for $45k. It was that cheap because no one had money to buy it. Nowadays same home is probably worth $200k+

I sold at $8300, waiting for a ~$4500. Anything above is overpriced. If it easily dropped from $20k to $6k when the crypto hype was at it's peak and there was a lot of support, it would be no problem dropping now from $10k to ~4k level.

Btc miners get 1800 btc daily or $15mil at current price and the investors on average need to pour in $15mil fiat daily just to keep the price flat.  Until mining is over bitcoin indeed looses it's value daily even if price goes up

Bitcoin was beautiful when it started, it lacked greed and people were willing to work for free to improve it and support it. Such ideology and foundation is gone forever and won't ever be seen in any other cryptocurrency. 
Nowadays founders of crypto get hundreds of millions of $ through IPOs, dump their stashes constantly and falsely advertise their roadmaps while most of their investors are taking loses. Not a great example of trust.

because there are cheaper, easier to use, and safer methods of payments out there. Not to say crypto doesn't have special use cases, but for the rest it's a waste of time and money for both the buyer and the seller. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:23:14
i agree with you, crypto has some use cases were traditional payment methods are not possible or efficient. People will pay whatever fees and will wait for transaction confirmations as much as needed because there are not better options. 
In the rest of cases where traditional payments are better, crypto is a waste of time and money as a payment solution

when an asset's value skyrockets for no reason it's a clear indication of a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 09:17:50
In a way it is. On the top are exchanges who make the most of the money, below are whales who consist of professionals, lower are wannabe whales with good skills, tools and who are well informed and on the bottom are regular investors who usually don't know what are they doing.   
Some people here say that with such logic stock market could be also considered a pyramid which is true but it has a different and more complex hierarchy with many safety nets that keep the pyramid from collapsing in case any layers fail. Crypto lacks such safety nets which leads many to believe that it is also a bubble. Last years drop of Ethereum briefly from ~$300 to a few cents (don't remember exact numbers) is a clear indication.

Tether with it's $200-300mil appearing from nowhere and pumping bitcoin is the only thing that kept it $6000+ for so long. If tether is gone i wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin falls to $1000

by regular investors i mean people who are easily manipulated into fomo, bear and bull traps, short squeezes, buying/selling at the wrong time and so on.   
Investment against the banks or free coin is nonsense. You read too much shill propaganda. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:57:35
That's a good example. In case of an RPG game both the buyer and the seller won't ever create any disputes because the items are 100% what they are described, can't deteriorate for any reasons and can't break during shipping. The only dispute i can think of is if buyer/seller/servers get hacked in which case RPG support team will help. 
In case of buying/selling goods and services, Smart Contracts without central intitutions that would add another layer of security and trust would simply fail. Such central institutions would need to hire tens of thousands technical support personnel or more depending on how big you think crypto trading can go. 
Exchanges currently make billions of $ and when there are issues like transactions getting stuck (most common) or sending crypto to the wrong address or wallet, account getting hacked and so on it could take days, weeks, months to solve something relatively simple. Now compare their mediocre service to what could happen on a bigger scale like for example a similar to an Amazon trading volume crypto platform. Smart contracts would likely fail with or without central institutions because there are to many limitations to crypto for such case

Tether itself doesn't make money, on the contrary it loses money. (buying or selling crypto at a loss, paying banks the interest rate) It was created by Bitfinex with intent of manipulatively increasing trading volume and profits made by the fees.

I enjoyed some insights in the article, something you'd never learn by following shill posts. He definitely exaggerated some evaluations, but other than that most of his points of view are valid. He was the first to uncover Bitfinex/Tether relationship so i'm pretty sure he has greater understanding than anyone else who is willing to speak
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:33:49
Exchanges, miners and shitcoin scammers are entities who profit hundreds of millions a month no matter where the market is going and they'll leave investors in the dust if it benefits them.   Fake fiat $ you say? Not as fake as crypto in comparison when 90% of trading volume was faked and Mt.gox bought over 800k bitcoins with fake money to pump up the price, or currently Tether that has $2.8 billion of mostly fake money that are not backed by anything. Crypto is very far from being a reliable and trustworthy investment at the moment and the army of shills with fake claims and information are not helping it becoming so.  
Don't get me wrong, i'd like bitcoin to progress and succeed but it needs to grow naturally on true merits instead of lies for long term benefit.
Most people who got hyped with lies by shills and bought crypto in 2017 then later got burned with loses may be lost forever as future potential investors. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 08:22:19
i guess not
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:02:21
I believe the real backing of Tether from fiat is somewhere in the 10-25% range and they currently have issues paying intetest to banks even on that because Tether bought too much bitcoin and can't currently sell it for a profit without the market going down and with it the crypto hype which is crucial for exchange's profits.
It is illegal for exchanges to counterfeit $ and buy bitcoin with it, it is not illegal to counterfeit Tether and buy bitcoin with it. Legally Tether doesn't owe an audit to anyone unless it goes down.

The greed and corruption in crypto supersedes the banks by far if we take into consideration the ratio of use. 
Why can't we just use crypto and enjoy it for what it is instead of listening to and praise stupid hype of big whales bag holders like this one?

BAAKT is just another type of whale that wants to get into the crypto business to make money. For someone to make money, someone has to lose money. I wouldn't be so hyped about it.

AMD lost 23% today after hours. It's an indication that it's not just a temporary selloff. Once crypto catches over the stock news it's more than likely to follow it's bear sentiment.

A friend of mine that works at an exchange told me only exchanges and whales make money now, the rest of traders are just pawns. The big swings are made by exchanges to make trading volume go 5x or more which equals 5x or more profits. Whales have the tools to catch those swings at the right time automatically and profit. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:30:44
That's an incomplete evaluation of just overlaying USDT distribution and BTC price. Adding trading volume and the amount of buy/sell orders at the time of spikes would have created a better picture.
The pump from 6.5k to 12k or the ones that followed after or when market was surely going down, but miraculously stayed flat weren't all merits of small traders and whales. There is a lot more Tether in circulation than there should be and Tether got to a point where it can't issue more Tether without being absolutely obvious of being partially fake.

It is ok that banks are taking a few days to run their anti scam/hacking procedures and algorithms for security purposes. 
Everyone calls blockchain super secure which is true but the real world use of crypto in general proved to be very shady and untrustworthy over the years. People got and will continue getting scammed/hacked a lot more with crypto than fiat considering the ratio of use for both. Security beats speed, convenience, profitability or whatever else you like about crypto. Due to the decentralized, unregulated and somewhat untraceable nature of crypto which is it's impressive forte it may never be as secure as the banking system.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:53:33
The analysis is utterly incomplete and feels like another shill post to dumb down people.  Where is the percentage of use correlation between fiat and bitcoin, the effects on economy which all the banking jobs contribute to, the fact that something very similar to traditional banks in addition to miners would need to take place if fiat is completely gone. Also S9 is not the only bitcoin miner. 
All things considered, the electricity that miners use and computing power they produce is mostly a waste. 
A better comparison would have been the security costs of both crypto and fiat considering the percentage of use. Security is the only purpose of miners
@_date: 2018-10-26 09:46:20
if price per BTC is 100k = $180 mil / day miners fee or $90mil/day in 2020 when halvening happens.

@_date: 2018-10-30 08:49:48
It's not going to ruin the world, at least not by itself. 
Bitcoin alone uses currently electricity equivalent of about 8 nuclear power plants output. 1 nuclear power plant can run ~100 million household led bulbs. (10w each) 
You can surround the entire globe with LED bulbs 0.64km distance from each other and run them continuously with the electricity bitcoin miners use. 
In my opinion that would be just as useless and damaging to the environment as mining bitcoin. 
If bitcoin or any other crypto will ever reach the potential it deserves it needs to get rid of the current mining waste and find cheaper and more efficient ways of security and decentralization. Current mining is not even decentralized anymore and majority of people will look the other way, ignore the problems the crypto has, and support lies for their own gain which is more of a rotten path than progress for crypto.
Imagine in the near future banks paying off officials all over the world to acknowledge global warming and force all the countries to ban crypto mining because of it. It would be game over for crypto.

Have you ever sold anything on ebay or amazon? Amazon has a lot of peer to peer transactions and ebay is mostly peer to peer based. Many of your credit card fears are baseless and you sound like you are reinventing the wheel. There are thousands of disputes a day between buyers and sellers on this platforms which can be resolved fairly and securely by this trading platforms which have the power of reverting the payments made.   
Who are you going to ask for help if the seller shipped you junk or nothing at all and doesn't want to return your bitcoin?  
"with crypto, now you can transact directly with individuals, small businesses, networks, strangers" You can do this a lot quicker, cheaper and more securely with venmo, paypal.  
You seem like a smart guy, but you are either brainwashed or try to brainwash others.

bitcoin can theoretically grow in price $1000 with just one $1 buy order,  but don't forget it can also go down $1000 with $1 sell order. 
Someone has to buy crypto in order for someone else to be able to dump it at a stable price. Count all the billions of $ the exchanges, miners and experienced whales profit. For every $1 that comes into crypto market, best case scenario people (unexperienced traders) are getting ~$0.70 back on average.

Altcoins are a big problem. In 2014 bitcoin's share of market was 90% , now is 37%. Altcoins, which at least 1/3 are scams are basically printing out money of thin air.

If price goes down by only 1% that individual losses $3 mil. Another let's say 0.25% exchange fee is another $750k. Sums like this are actually sold privately in chunks for a much bigger discount than 0.25% that exchanges charge. Maybe 5% or 10%, i can only guess. To find someone buy even close to $50mil wouldn't be easy and it would take some time.

Last few weeks whales tried to jump start the bullruns but couldn't sustain the price. A few more pumps were made the last few days ("bart") but it was clear that there is a shortage of buyers. Whales can't pump forever at a loss so they dumped and are waiting for lower price to get back in. Considering that the price didn't jump back up strong after it hit sub $6k i think price will go lower to ~$5300.

Bitcoin and all other 1000+ crypto are in a bubble, all of them are highly deceptive, don't live to expectations, and are controlled by fiat. Fiat is "supposedly" backed by gold, and crypto is backed by fiat, this hierarchy will never change, whoever says otherwise is either a troll, whale or a dreamer. We have yet to see a major global economy crash which is due sooner or later and when it will happen all crypto will loose at least 95% because people won't have anymore savings to invest in crypto and will withdraw to make ends meet. A government has means to stabilize, borrow billions/trillions to save fiat. Who will save crypto when a major crash happens? Ride the crypto bandwagon and milk it as much as you can but don't forget to be cautious.

In 2017 everyone on the planet was bombarded with the crypto hype and everyone could buy even $5 worth of crypto. People who didn't buy it in 2017 are very less likely to buy during the next hype.

Well it worked just fine in 2009. People were able to mine close to 100 bitcoins then with an old single core laptop. If you can mine on a raspberry pi nowadays, a 20 year old PC is a lot more powerful. Today we run the blockchain on hundreds of thousands more processing power (compare an s9 antminer to single core cpu hashrate) yet the performance decreased considerably.

3/4 btc is "lost".  If they disbursed the remaining btc to all customers, legally speaking customers could sue again because they received only ~3/4 of their btc. If lawsuit disburses fiat then it's a done deal and customers can never say they didn't receive their initial investment back

If not for the greedy and manipulative miners, scam ICO's, phishing attacks and fake scam exchanges and speculators who siphon billions of dollars out every year, crypto would be at least at 5x market cap right now. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:11:01
technical analysis can't predict someone selling or buying a lot. It's only for statistical purpose and in such an extremely volatile market it's near worthless. News and whales dictate the price. Other signals like buy and sell walls are 90% fake and are made by bots/whales which very often buy and sell their own walls to create fomo.  
needless to say 5k won't happen. Price is held down artificially at the moment so whales can accumulate btc. Imagine if you wanted to buy 1000 btc cheap and you could drive the price down by selling only 200-300btc at the right time. Happens all the time. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:26:53
I believe exchanges are causing it. whenever the prices stabilize the trading volume goes down then price manipulation orders are being placed by exchanges and the trading volume increases 2-3x which is 2-3x profits in trading fees. They are the biggest whales in crypto market and some of them are using fiat created out of thin air (Mt.Gox, Tether, probably many others)
@_date: 2018-11-14 11:23:42

oh please, most of the people in the world didn't even have a landline phone in the early 90s yet alone internet. Pcs were ~$2000 (about $6000 in today's value) internet were available was very slow and expensive, graphic cards could not render much, programmers were rare. Internet was held back by technology that's why it developed so slow.  If you make a comparison to blockchain then internet, processing power, workforce didn't hold it back 10 years ago, and it doesn't hold it back today and  there are no technological advancements yet to be discovered or improved that could benefit greatly the blockchain and make it skyrocket. 
So no, you can not give an excuse for blockchain not moving much anywhere in 10 years and give as example the internet.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:13:11
i'm a cisco professional and microsoft professional: Enterprise administrator so i'm far from clueless. With all the technology and workforce available for blockchain compared to early days of internet, the blockchain should have developed 10x faster yet it did not because of the big disadvantage compared to traditional methods - the cost.

i agree, but information like this could be used to understand that buying at $10.5-11.5k+ right now like some people did a few days ago, is a wrong move at the moment. Whales can pump but not for long if there are not as many regular buyers. I believe price will stay for a while at 9k range until natural support is built up

Lighting network can't scale as well, look up double spend issue. It also can add many security issues and costs too much for single use (open a channel fee) It looks good on paper just like bitcoin but in practice it's not usable on a large global scale. 
In the upcoming years if another altcoin comes up with a scalability solution while keeping the security similar to bitcoin i see no reason why it wouldn't surpass bitcoin.

1. look it up, type in google "lighting network can't scale" What you've been reading are shill posts if you are not aware of issues.  
2. look it up, same as  
3. Transactions on lighting network are off the blockchain for most of the time and are less secure because of it. Hijacking computers, servers, networks that use lighting network is a lot easier than trying to hack the blockchain.   
4. Like for example a store that i'm only visiting once and want a quick lighting network transaction?  
Ok, if you had an option to receive 500 gift cards from 500 stores or 1 visa card with the equivalent cash on it, which one would you pick? This is comparable to lighting network vs blockchain direct use transactions.  
If a more capable and scalable solution will ever appear lighting network will perish.

greedy miners are the reason why bitcoin is not at $30-$40k level at the moment. They opposed any significant improvements to the blockchain for as long as they could so more profits could be gained. It's a bit risky for them to continue this tactic as Ethereum and some other promising projects could leave BTC behind in the near future if no changes to performance are made. Cost per transaction is at 1/10 compared to a few weeks ago, so that's a good start.

buy low and sell high, it took me a while to really understand this and apply it. If it goes lower don't sell, if it goes higher - sell at some point and never buy higher even if you have to wait months for a dip.

the chart seems legit to me and the claims as well. Mtgox was buying  bitcoin with fake accounts and money on it's own. Tether buys bitcoin with "supposedly" real money, at least a portion of it and people also buy/sell crypto with tether. The problem with tether is that no one knows how much bitcoin is tether buying/selling on it's own. You probably already know the story with the tether audit.

fake buy walls could not stop the overpriced btc from falling the last 2 days. As soon as someone dumps a lot on a big exchange whales start dumping on all other exchanges. Many people and whales bought BTC at $6-7k and are afraid of loosing on profits also. Many stop loss orders are triggered also when price goes down. It's all related. 
It could be also tether dumping btc to fiat so they can have proof of funds before having a hearing with CFTC. Vitalik Buterin 's statements like bad scalability, high risk of investment and the like usually cause a big dip after. Many listen to him closely because he doesn't sugar coat issues and tells it like it is.

Bitcoin uses electricity equivalent of 8 nuclear power plants. Of course there is a wind, water, solar % of electricity used by miners, but it's insignificant to coal burning %
It is false to say that bitcoin mining doesn't contribute to climate change. 
8 nuclear power plants is enough to surround the entire land area of the globe with household led bulbs 0.18km (0.11 mile) apart from each other and run them 24/7.  Insignificant amount of energy as some say? I don't think so.

bitmain made $2.3 billion revenue last year. There are miners with considerable savings as well. Both could set up a buy wall with a few millions of $. Otherwise they could potentially loose the business for a long time. When whales who sold at $7-$20k detect that price can't breach new lows everyone will start flooding back the market.

Only a short sighted miner can oppose lightning. Fees won't go away, they'll just be lower temporarily. Bitcoin wouldn't stand a chance to go mainstream in the future without solutions like lightning. In fact with the increased fees and slow transaction time many merchants abandoned bitcoin in 2016-2017. With bitcoin being mainstream miners will have their hefty rewards, no worries.
And once we are talking about miners. The heck was an antminer s9 $1800 in 2016 and why it is $4000 in 2018? Same thing goes for video cards that double or tripled in price. We don't need that many miners that use as much power as Argentina. Mining currently got to the point i believe it's beyond ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:02:41
tether and corupt exchanges are keeping things afloat just fine, no need to worry about miners.

I bought at 8600 and put a stop sell order at 7900. Not that big of a deal for me if it goes below 7900, but i highly doubt it. No regular 0.1 - 2btc investors are going to break that wall and no whales are stupid enough to sell at that wall so the effect will be the price going up. That image is only on gdax but i believe it's about the same situation across all exchanges

Can the blockchain/nodes be tampered to  give an advantage to a certain mining pool? Like for example delay a few seconds information about the found blocks to other pools/miners and make the desired pool look first for new blocks or let's say somehow make other miners find new blocks slightly harder or any other tricky solutions that could give an advantage to a desired mining pool?
I have doubts that all the miners are treated equally. Any major mining company would certainly look for loopholes.

I noticed that as well and i'm sure someone buys or sells their own orders just to create fomo. I also noticed whenever trading volume goes below 15000 on gdax some big pump or dump occurs and trading volume increases greatly. Also gdax is following precisely the price on bitfinex 1-2 seconds after and buy/sell walls are added or removed accordingly in order to keep with bitfinex situation.

because many people and whales believe it can go lower in price and they could increase their bitcoin numbers after buying lower. Some are selling and waiting for the price to stabilize even if they could loose some bitcoin if price goes up. It's much less of a risk doing so at this point. Holding is for inexpirienced

what if a whale puts a 100 btc sell order and buys it itself, or vice versa puts a 100 btc buy order and sells it itself? Would this not skew the technical analysis and give wrong signals? things like this are done very often i believe. Whales are well aware of technical analysis that many traders are following and i don't think it's too difficult to manipulate the TA with a few $ millions and a few thousand btc.

remind me again what are the cryptography puzzles that all the miner hardware solve are used for? Actual transactions that get confirmed on the blockchain don't even use  1% of graphic card or asic full computation power, the rest is a waste.

I don't think the hash computations is what entirely secures the blockchain. The increased number of miners is the main factor of securing the blockchain. Hashrate is just a measure related to rewards for participating on the blockchain and a proof of hardware that can't be faked by software. Anyway, i still believe the blockchain could be put to better use than useless computations while not decreasing security.

you don't know who put that order. Exchanges are not going to let crypto fall dramatically otherwise they will loose 10-20x of their trades and fees for the next 2-3 years. Coinbase for example makes 2.7 mil a day. Bitminer announced recently that they made 2.3 billions $ last year. If the price goes down more imagine their losses if bitcoin becomes unprofitable to mine. Altcoin's value are tied to bitcoin and those would not want bitcoin going down much further. Whales that hold considerable amounts of cash would not benefit from a further price going down. 
I laugh at people who say bitcoin will go down to 5k or as others say 0.

Other internet companies that have a single point of selling products and services like google, apple, facebook could adopt it with a lot less hassle.

Gdax charts are pretty good. You can have also bitfinex open. Sometimes when bitfinex takes off $350+ more it's a good signal that gdax price will follow. When gdax is only about $100 less than bitfinex, gdax price is about to go down. Not always of course but usually. Trade history shows the last amount of btc bought and sold and at what price. Green = bought , red = sold. In order book green = those who want to buy, red = those who want to sell. Aggregation at the bottom of the order book changes the scale of order book. If you scale order book to 10 for ex when you see someone putting a green buy order of 20 btc and there are not much for sale in the red tab for the next $100, price is certain to quickly go up $100 and vice versa when you see a 20 btc red sell order. Very often bots put big 15-30 btc buy or sell orders when they actually don't want to buy or sell respectively but make other traders believe that demand is high or low depending where they want to steer the price. Such orders are usually automatically removed as soon as someone buys or sells respectively a small amount from their 15-30 btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:22:47
bitcoin miners get 1800 btc a day or currently $16 million which i believe it's an outrageous cost that won't grow much over the years. Ads on internet make ~$230 million a day which grows 20% every year.

By depth chart i suppose you mean the red and green lines that you can zoom in and out of? if so depth chart can be very tricky. It represents all the buy and sell orders from the Order book tab in a visual way. Very often you see green line twice as big as the red line for ex for the next $500 or $1000 price of btc which indicates a good demand, yet the price goes down like we've seen the past few days. If you want to take a gamble to make 2-5% once in a while than you can watch the red or green line and place your limit order before there is a considerable spike in price on the line (look "for a total of" or amount of BTC when hovering over the line) 
For me personally I've learned that charts don't mean that much and it's better and safer to follow good and bad news instead.

Many people refer to blockchain as the internet 2.0 . Many say cryptocurrencies are in their infancy, yet bitcoin is 10 years old and over the years it's real use with merchants only diminished because of high fees and slow performance. What most of the people don't understand is the price investors have to pay for blockchain to run (currently ~$18 million daily for bitcoin alone) When blockchain will be cheaper and will run faster than visa, or when applications will be cheaper to run on blockchain than on Amazon cloud, i'd have no doubt about blockchain.

I don't think it will hit $10000 in 2018. A strong dump is long overdue and it will most likely happen before christmass. Low trading volume on recent pumps/dumps suggests that interest in crypto is not going up and whales are exhausted by pumping at a loss. 
Bitmain is the main blocker of bears at the moment but they will eventually remove the buy walls and let bitcoin fall briefly for a few days.

Regulations are inevitable and are good for cryptocurrency in long term. China didn't ban mining, it's only rumors of banning mining which if come true would actually be good for BTC because it reduces the chance of 51% attack. India is not banning crypto, they are against people buying goods with crypto. Exchanges are fine. South Korea wants to lower the illegal cash outflow and fight money laundering, they are pro crypto otherwise.
There are many other major countries that officially supported recently cryptocurrency and some of them have no tax on crypto gains for the next few years. 
Any country that may have it's economy damaged by illegal crypto transactions, money laundering, ponzy schemes, scam ICO's are doing a favor to their citizens by regulating and monitoring closely the crypto market. It's not that much of a big deal as the media and speculators want us to believe.

I'm just saying, paying 20 millions a day to miners even today is a waste. It should be a lot less. Blockchain doesn't need that many miners with super expensive and powerful mining equipment that solve useless puzzles. We are being ripped off by exchanges with fake hacks, price manipulations and miners that oppose any performance changes for as long as they can.

Bitcoin currently pays to miners close to $20 millions a day (1800btc)  For the price of btc to reach $1 million , miners would get $1.8 Billions a day. Do you think there would be enough buyers of btc daily to counter the $1.8 Billion average daily sales of miners? $1 mil per bitcoin is not real even if everyone in the world invested in BTC.

ask your parents, grandparents or anyone else without much Internet use skills to buy bitcoin and send to your address and see how much time they'll spend doing it. 
4 million out of ~17 million currently in circulation bitcoin are lost forever due mostly to negligence and poor/basic PC use skills. Even advanced users often send to wrong addresses, get hacked, have hardware failures and so on.

isn't there a fee for opening a LN channel? please correct me if i'm wrong, but if let's say 2 people open a LN channel just for one and only transaction wouldn't they pay more fees comparing to traditional sending method? 
From my understanding LN is cost efficient only when multiple transactions are hapenning on the channel. There is also the double spend issue with LN i know not much about, but i know it exists.

What if instead of proof of processing power something like proof of ISP address was implemented and only one miner per ISP address was allowed? VPN cost money, separate ISP line/address cost money so it would be difficult and pricey to create an attack. This could probably solve the mining cartels problem.

i checked the dictionary for "manipulation" and the before mentioned terms match perfectly with it :) 
"to manage or influence skillfully, especially in an unfair manner"
"to adapt or change (accounts, figures, etc.) to suit one's purpose or advantage."
Synonyms: juggle, falsify.
I agree with you on "doesn't explain or predict anything" Very often manipulation has it's limits of course, specially if someone stronger like a corporation starts adopting or abandoning crypto unexpectedly. Or a miner cartel decides to sell a lot because of business expansion plan.

you think in a case of a global financial meltdown when people struggle paying mortgages and rent, lose jobs, live from paycheck to paycheck and accumulate credit card debt will have a lot of money to invest in cryptocurrency? 
On the contrary, in such event the whales will dump like there is no tomorrow, and the "hodlers" will sell crypto later at whatever low price to make the ends meet.

Whenever someone is doing a transaction on an exchange, the blockchain is not aware of it. All the transactions are done internally on exchanges, separately from blockchain. Only when someone deposits or withdraws crypto and leaves to another exchange or a wallet the blockchain becomes aware of it and requires a transaction fee to be paid.

@_date: 2018-04-26 16:26:23
they became rich before most of the people heard about crypto and sold before 2018. Don't expect the gains those people had. Gains won't go up exponentially like they did before, considering there is a limit to crypto adoption, banks banning credit card crypto purchases, China and India banning crypto, many people loosing a lot since $20k and spreading fud and a lot of other factors. Realistically expect a 2x gain, best case scenario within a year
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:43:55
no, of course i don't, but i don't think crypto would be better. If you consider ratio of total amount of crypto and fiat in use, crypto has a lot more scams, manipulations and "hacks" going on due to it's unregulated and "decentralized" nature.

create a stop loss order. Let's say at 6500/bitcoin. If it goes down you loose 2% of fiat but have the chance to rebuy bitcoin lower at maybe 6000-6300. You get more bitcoin this way and sell it for more $ later when price goes up.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:00:02
considering it halves 2 times until then. ~$110 mil daily on average , just to sustain the price flat is impossible.

data recovery is fun. Take out the hard drive from the PC, put it into a usb enclosure or connect directly to another working PC. Download at least 5 data recovery tools from torrents. Try filtering the extension name of private keys from the list of recovered files. Expect spending 2-3 days for a thorough search. In the end you may find the file corrupted but it's worth a try
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:56:56
Oh yes, it is. Any asset that involves risk and frequently requires monitoring is gambling. "the house" for bitcoin are exchanges that proved to be highly corrupt in the past, whales that have no end to greed, miners that can easily twist developer's hands. "the house" for fiat is the government, banks. Who would you rather have control your life and savings? 
I'm not saying crypto has no use, or that it won't be beneficial, on the contrary, i think it's a cool new thing to poke around, but i dislike baseless propaganda ideas like "bitcoin is the future of money" or "bitcoin will solve all our problems" similar to top post.
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:19:26
1800 btc that miners mine daily x $250.000 = $450.000.000 Meaning investors will have to pour $450 mil into the market daily just to keep the price flat at $250k.

The trading volume is unusually low for the 25% gain that happened the last few days (only ~15000 btc daily on gdax) which means that not many people got in for the ride. Last time price went from 6-8k,  daily trading volume was ~40000 btc. Because of this, when whales start selling price will go down very sharply. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:10:12
wait, i wasn't talking about market cap. Like someone mentioned before i was wrong about the $450 mil number. If mining reward halves twice it means miners will get 450 btc daily. I'm not even counting rewards for transactions that miners also get. 450 btc x $250000(price per btc) = ~$110 mil.  To give a rough estimate, miners on average will cash out $110 mil daily. Let's pretend that no one else in the market is selling but miners. People would need to buy $110 mil worth of btc daily to sustain $250000 price per btc. To me that sounds impossible.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:00:21

maket needs to recover for at least half a year after whales mess up people's savings on such a big scale. Of course it will drop again.

3% is a bit optimistic. A median home in Chicago was $2000 in 1910. Nowadays it's $235k Which makes it roughly 4.88% inflation each year.
The amount of gold you could buy in 1910 with $2000 is almost the same you can buy today with $235k
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:15:48
i thought arbitrage is when you buy or sell once in a while. The buy/sell walls on gdax are happening almost all the time and their intention is not to buy or sell, but steer the price in bitfinex's direction. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:23:11
It takes a lot less money and less "news" for whales to pump price from $1700 to $20k than it is to pump the price nowadays ~12x to ~$100k.
At $20k price, miners of bitcoin alone were pulling out daily on average ~$36mil. fiat. That didn't work out well. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:24:43
What about "invest in crypto only what you can loose" which is being said all the time in the crypto community. This implies that you can loose almost everything. 
There is also another detail the article didn't cover. A person usually has any considerable savings from ~30 - 65 years old so the inflation would only devalue 35 years if nothing was invested in. People usually buy property though, so inflation is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:51:17

An asset that highly fluctuates in value is called gambling. The problem with gambling is that if you go all in like top post suggests , you may live like a king for a while, but "the house" always wins and one day you may become dirty poor no matter how rich you were before. It happened with stocks, real estate, even fiat in some poor countries which are a lot less volatile assets than crypto. You can't possibly think that every person on the planet will get hooked on gambling in the future and "play" crypto.
Funny thing about crypto is that every shill suddenly is worried about the wellbeing and wealth of humanity, while in fact the only thing they care about is to get rich themselves.
