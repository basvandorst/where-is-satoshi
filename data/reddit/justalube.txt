I agree that this sub is hard-headed. I mentioned a potential threat to bitcoin that I heard from someone else so that people could give opinions and make me feel less afraid of it. Turns out I get downvoted while the dude who replies in a pro bitcoin tone gets upvoted.

Just watched a video by DataDash who explains how the recent months of btc's price looks strikingly similar to the crash that happened at the end of 2013. Basically a huge "correction" should not really be a surprise. Anyone else have opinions on this? 
Edit: I just got downvoted for explaining a reasonable observation that I want to clarify with other people's opinions to make me feel less afraid. While upvotes goes to the guy that sounds more pro-bitcoin and I get half ass answers. This sub is snobby as fuck.

It's still pretty early but I first hopped on at 7000 and I'm so so glad I did

I don't think it's a matter of credibility

So I'm guessing the 50% off sale is over? ):

Just think of it as a sign up bonus. I got one without using anyone else's referral link.

This whole time I thought it was just "hold" and someone made a typo which then became a reference

What did I just read

Well if you're using Coinbase, all you do is enter the amount of USD you want to spend ($1000) and it'll convert it into however many btc is worth that much. Then just complete the purchase, pretty easy.

I'm still fairly new to the scene but I've heard bitcoin being referred to as the internet's gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:04:45
I definitely followed that saying for the first time I started. Couple days later... well
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:29:45
Awesome

For Coinbase it's either bank account or debit/credit card. Bank account has a lower fee but takes a couple of days for the btc to get into your hands. Card has a little higher fee but gives you the btc right away. No prob! Just helping out a beginner like I once was.

Have these guys done their research into what btc actually is? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:47:48
Of course it's impossible. But, correct me if I'm wrong, isn't it these types of articles that heavily contribute to big run ups? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:31:54
Then what?

Is there a bitcoin meme sub? I feel like moving all memes to that would appease people here
