What about forming credit unions? Anyone thought of that?
The members would have control.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:48:14
We would need at least 3000 members to be taken seriously for approval of the charter

This is very relevant news to Bitcoin... I totally see why it was posted here. The gist of the article is basically how much wealth is out there, and where it is being placed to keep it safe. Bitcoin can act as the common-man's offshore bank account. Could you imagine trillions of dollars being held in Bitcoin? What would that do to the value of the network and price per BTC?

Bhutan uses BTN for their currency, so BTC should be available.

I'm sorry, but their business model has scam written all over it. I would never give anyone money without a reasonable and realistic delivery date. When you give someone money for a product or service, you are basically entering into a contract by default. When you pay up, but the other party doesn't deliver, it's called a breach of contract and they can be sued. Fuck their "policy"! I've never heard of anything so ridiculous.

As we are now seeing, reliance on banks and exchanges is the primary point of failure in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Somehow, we need more local exchanges and person-to-person transactions. I believe this was the architect's original intention. Not to be traded like it's a penny stock...
I've had success buying Bitcoin with BitInstant and sending them to a private, non-exchange, wallet address. I plan on holding my coins until I need to spend them. I expect their value to increase over time as well, so I'm not in a hurry to exchange back into another mode of currency. If I do need to cash them out, I will find a local buyer and do a FTF transaction.
Right now, I feel like I have my own personal Swiss-style off-shore bank account... very cool!

The members own the credit union, so it would be self-funded. No need to get loans. If we need $10 million, and say we have 5000 members, we'd need to each put in for a share at $2000. I think that's how it would work.

Both those guys need to go find a hole somewhere and crawl into it
@_date: 2013-04-29 04:46:01
Great concept!
I would talk to the person you are leaving it with first. Maybe leave it at places you go to frequently, so if they need to ask you more about it, you can assist. Tell them it's like a digital piggy bank, and they can check the amount in their bank by scanning the code with their phone.

Yeah, that's exactly what I did. Went to my private (anonymous) address. Not on any site or exchange. I plan on doing it again soon.

I don't understand why he's suing all of these companies. Shouldn't he be suing CA or the US who makes these arbitrary laws which squashes competition because you have to be a big well financed corporation to play the game?

The one comedian I know of that would've loved Bitcoin... George Carlin. That guy could tell it like it is... stick it to the banks!

Cash some out, and take a nice vacation over the summer.
Hold on to the rest of your coins as investment/emergency fund.

You want to use BitInstant cash to bitcoin address option. It is the easiest way to go. Print out the receipt page and take it to a MoneyGram location where they have those red phones. It might be a little confusing at first, but after a couple of times, it'll be a piece of cake!

The "hive mind" of the Internet is also a political entity! We break **ALL** the rules! BTC is what we should use, so push for that. FYI, the market cap of Bitcoin is roughly the GDP of Bhutan... seriously!
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:14:15
Yes, I believe we could create a Credit Union for Bitcoin users.

There doesn't need to be more Bitcoins when you can divide one into one millionth. The value will increase with scarcity, which is the same reason physical gold is over $1000/oz. The properties of BTC are similar to gold as a store of wealth, which is why it is so attractive to users. I expect the value compared to other currencies to stabilize and grow. Who sets the prices? The early adopters and miners. If its not profitable to mine, then the prices will necessarily increase.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:47:13
I found this to be interesting... seems other people are discussing this as well.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:36:38
That's convenient to just make up some rules and start rolling heads! But when the government is supposed to abide by our Consititution, they wipe their ass with it!

I find certificates to be a dangerous proposition, even at full-reserve.
Could you imagine? Counterfeit Bitcoin certificates floating around? OMG!
Not only that, but a company issuing the certificates could fold, and take the coins you supposedly have, with them? What are your thoughts on that? I appreciate any and all insight you can shed on this. Just playing devil's advocate here... know what I mean? Thank you ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:00:28
I definitely think that something like that would work. Ideally, if it's built-in to the blockchain protocol. It would be decentralized and both parties would be able to confirm transfer. First both parties would confirm payment to an intermediate address, and then the goods or services could be submitted upon the initial confirmation. Then, upon delivery, or even shipment confirmation, the transfer would complete. It would also require some kind of cancellation process in the case that either party fails to perform (possibly within an agreed upon time frame). Any thoughts? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:42:49
Of course the highest buyer and lowest seller set the price, but initial sellers are the miners, and they probably aren't going to sell at a loss! Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:06:17
It's not that bad... I'd rather not give my ID and SSN to some company. I will happily pay a fee for some personal privacy.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:39:25
Okay, I appreciate your reply, but what's worse...inflation or deflation? Also, why one vs the other? When the US Fed is pumping 85 Billion USD per month into the  money supply, I see this as a major problem. When wages are static for the most part, and it takes more to cover your cost of living, this is a major problem.
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:16:26
I've used BitInstant through CVS MoneyGram... worked great. Transaction went through and got confirmation email within minutes.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:39:16
No, it's the government that's incompetent, bro. Nobody deserves this crap.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:27:59
Last I checked, rules and guidelines aren't law...
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:53:49
That's a great idea. How do we get the word out so we can see how much interest there would be?
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:44:59
For Bitcoin to succeed, there needs to be a growing and thriving BTC-based economy. The trading back and forth between USD and BTC is the biggest problem for Bitcoin. This is what has the government regulators so upset. I don't think they have a problem with buying BTC, and ideally, it should be one way... USD -&gt; BTC.
So, I believe the solution is to find more ways to earn BTC. Start businesses that accept BTC and keep them in your wallet accounts. Don't sell them (unless absolutely necessary). For a while, we'll have to live and work in two worlds USD vs BTC. However, once we're able to purchase our basic necessities (home, food, clothing, energy, data/comm) in BTC, we'll be well on our way to freedom. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 17:11:54
Wouldn't this "certificate" option just take us a step backward toward the fractional-reserve banking system where the banks and clearing houses are in control of the money supply? I believe the way to keep Bitcoin legit is to keep all transactions logged in the blockchain, don't you think?
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:35:37
I wouldn't put any links or qr codes on the stamp, because if the   monopoly money printers get pissed they will be tracking down either your personal website you print on it, or bitcoin.org. I wouldn't want to see anyone get in trouble. Also, nowhere on this does anything say "bitcoin", so we certainly need that. Personally, I would keep it simple and just put something catchy like: "Save Bitcoin!", "Get Bitcoin!", "Who is Satoshi?" or even "It's time for Plan **B**itcoin" with the BTC symbol.
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:54:56
1. I'm glad you feel that your life is better with government, but I believe the consensus is that we need less government and more freedom. Which is why there is a huge Libertarian movement behind Bitcoin.
2. The people fighting Bitcoin want to keep their monopoly power. Not to mention, a central-bank is part of a communist-based system, which is repugnant to a free society.
3. The OP was not declaring "war", they were simply making a statement of fact... they've taken notice to bank account seizures, new regulations and law suits.

Surplus funds would be great! Then would could afford to put our ATMS everywhere, and build more infrastructure!

I second that! I taught myself to code BASIC in 1985 when I was 10... then, when the Internet went mainstream in the late 90's I renewed my interest in programming, quit my IT support job, and started my own business in web development. Never looked back. Now, I'm totally immersed in the Bitcoin world, and see endless opportunities with this. Bitcoin is a great platform to build very advanced systems, and I love that it's open-source.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:18:52
Let's all just say Bitcoin is a commodity and call it day?! We're all essentially just buying, selling and trading a commodity aren't we? Are there any stricter rules and regulations against that?

When did you order it, and did BFL ever give you an actual delivery date?

Steps to take...
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:46:00
You're talking like you were an investor or shareholder, not a consumer. So which one were you??? At least as a shareholder, you would be able to sell your shares and/or make the company you own accountable for their actions... and if they succeed, you're probably make more money than Bitcoin mining... just sayin'
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:59:55
I agree, with you. Okay, I'm going a little bit off onto a tangent here, but you sparked my interest...
Government should be there to protect our rights and property, and provide us with a fair legal/criminal system, but not at our fellow citizen's expense. Meaning, I shouldn't have to pay for the prosecution and imprisonment of someone who I have nothing to do with. There should never be a State vs Man lawsuit ever! The State is not a person with rights. If someone breaks a law, it is against another person, not The State as some entity with unlimited funds. If I want to start a lawsuit, I have to hire a lawyer. So should the other party.
Government at the local regional level should always trump continental and global levels. As I see it, we need the following with all levels above 1 be completely voluntary... meaning no career politicians or paid positions.
1. Person/Household/Property (What I do on my property with my property is my business and no one else's, so long as I'm not infringing on anyone else's rights to do the same or disturbing the peace)
2. City/Community (Local level of basic rules for the community to coexist in peace and prosperity. It would not be unheard of for "peace" officers to be voluntary as well.)
3. State (Facilitate relationships/grievances between cities/communities)
4. Country/Region (Facilitate relationships/grievances between States)
5. World (Facilitate relationships/grievances between Country/Regions)
I believe this would prevent someone or some entity control over any one persons life, liberty or pursuit of happiness. If you don't like the rules or regulations in one community, you could be free to move somewhere else, even at a global level, without restriction.
P.S. America should not be the World Police ;-)
I'm open to comments...
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:16:50
I agree with "malicious"! I believe we all need to step up our game and really take responsibility for how we want things to be for a prosperous future. That means watching out for each other and pushing forward for liberty.
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:32:45
I love Bitcoin, but this BFL bullshit is a textbook example of a Ponzi scheme! If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I don't understand people who defend this crap and are so gullible... this is not a "circle jerk" bashing of BFL. I actually have my own business and I'm looking out for the Bitcoin community.  Risk is for investors. The customer should never take on this level of risk when purchasing a product or service and having to wait a year or more... insanity!
