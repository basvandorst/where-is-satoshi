What happens to litecoin if lightning network is a success?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:41
Just said how they're going to get burned like they did in november.  Also called it bcash a couple of times.  Asked what makes bcash better than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:26
Last time this happened.  Bitcoin cash got dumped.  A lot of people lost money.  Koreans especially when bithumb went down.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:43
You guys obviously never held ethereum or any other alts.  This is a drop in the bucket.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:00
HAHA noob.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:02:07
Bought the dip.  Didn’t catch the absolute bottom this time.  Oh well.  Life goes on.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:08:57
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:18
I don't know about you guys but i'm buying.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:48
If youre selling your bitcoin for bcash.  You're going to get burned just like everyone who did this the other month.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:05:42
Where are the fucking memes guys.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:46:36
Saw a 100 btc buy there and it bounced right off so i guess..
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:11:36
Get ready for liftoff boys.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:21:40
Theres a error message.  Mine shows the right balance now but won't let me send coins.  FUCK!
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:42:49
Does anyones ledger show the wrong balance?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:55
LOL just got banned from for speaking the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:22:47
It could very well be over.   Too many eyes waiting on the sidelines to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:45:19
Nah bro.  Tyreke Hill.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:28:07
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:24:11

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:04:47
Dude delete this comment don’t tell people how much you have.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:20:47
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:00:37
Don’t think so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:50:33
Heres why i think bitcoin cash dumps in the near future.  If you are said bitcoin cash whale.  You wanna sell large amounts and cause fear and fud.  Drop the bitcoin cash price down.  And if you really believe in the project bitcoin cash said whale will buy back in for a cheaper price than he sold.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:10:14
Remember what happened in November guys.  Bitcoin Cash fucked over a lot of people and they had to buy back into bitcoin with a lot smaller stack.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:07
Remember guys do your part and dump bcash for bitcoin once you get it from Coinbase.  Do your job.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:31:54
Dan bilzarian or Andreas?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:08:28
At least drop the roller coaster guy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:16:43
Who caught the bottom at 13.5?
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:12:05
Yes.  Just sign into Gdax using your coinbase account.  Deposit from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:24:08
Do I start Alex Smith against the chargers or dak Prescott against the raiders?  Asked the fantasy football subreddit but no answer.  Figured I’m going to buy bitcoin if I win my fantasy so you guys decide for me.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:34:36
Wow thanks for such quick responses guys.  I’m leaning towards dak right now seeing how Oakland has been terrible and chargers have been lights out.  So 3-2 for dak for now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:45:28
Is it just me or are these confirmations taking forever?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:34:51
This is not a lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:44:44
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:12:51
Because 70k is definitely worth stealing if a hacker.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:26:36
Yeah started tyreke Hill and Tarik Cohen today.  Going against Michael Thomas,  kamara, and Drew Brees.  Not looking to good.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:29:24
Love old houses.
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:59:43
Whose cutting onions?
@_date: 2019-02-27 05:22:51
I feel so bad for anyone trading their BTC for bolivars.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:01:57
Yeah how do you go about shorting bch.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:45:21
Just bought at 6300.  Bought some at 6800 before too before all the bcc drama.  Hodl.  Been watching on the sidelines with alts for far too long watching btc hit 7900 and realizing it will always be king just because the name itself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:42
Who shorted bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:24:23
Its a lot of things.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:07:03
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:20:36
Anyone else waiting a really long time for confirmations?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:03:46
That sucks man.  But i meant confimations to send from coinbase to my wallet.  I'm under the impression that if you don't have it in your bank coinbase will cancel the transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:33:37
I hear twitter is a good way to get their attention.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:55:00
