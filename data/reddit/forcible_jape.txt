The article said he used British English sometimes due to the fact that he had frequent communication with British companies when he was learning English..  Also, if he was concerned about anonymity, he would probably use a proxy server which might disguise the location of the mining rigs and the origination of the emails..
The reverse Polish notation is also fascinating..  Something an older computer engineer might do.
But yeah, all that seems a little strange and I'm inclined to be skeptical as much as I would love for this person to be the founder of bitcoin.

It's not censorship according to its strictest definition, but I think you understand what I'm getting at.  Equivocation isn't really an argument...  unless you don't have one.

I have been the victim of buyer fraud (chargeback after merchandise is received) on more than one occasion.  I have lost thousands to it, not to mention the time spent fighting with PayPal, etc.

BlockChain.info is not a URL.
 is a URL.

Well, if they're going to use a pedantic technicality to censor their message boards, I don't think it's out of bounds to use that same degree of pedantry in defense of the posting.  
 I thought it might be the other thing at first but was a little confused by the discussion following..  same argument applies, though -- a URL is a uniform resource locator -- something that can be followed to a node on the web.  CoinCadence cannot be followed anywhere.  If I picked the username "Ford," for instance, one would probably not assume that the name was a URL, but placing www. in front and .com after it would clearly constitute a violation of the ToS.

Although I agree that bitcoin is highly speculative, I would hesitate to call it a naked gamble, because with some analysis and a good strategy it is possible to increase the likelihood of a positive return.  Is it real estate? No.  Does a seasoned trader stand a better chance than a monkey throwing darts at a decision matrix? Undoubtedly.

Absolutely ridiculous.  Gains and losses aren't realized from investments until they are sold.
Betting in a card game is completely different.  You must constantly add more money to the pot in order to stay in (unless everyone checks throughout the hand, but that's unlikely in a game with skilled players).  The reason you might consider bets you have made in the past "lost" until you win the hand is that the hand continues to evolve while the cost to see it out rises with every round of betting.
Consider someone who is short-stacked and all-in on the flop.  What reason do they have to capitulate?   
A bitcoin investor should know what they want from their investment before they buy.  Every day after, they should wake up asking two questions:  1) Have any of my fundamental assumptions changed (is it still as good as I thought it was)? and 2) What is the likelihood of movement and in what direction?  
They should NEVER make decisions as though the money the invested has been lost.  To do so would be stupid and reckless.

Yeah, but they could do deep packet inspection and slow down or stop transactions from happening since the state has fairly tight control of the Internet in China.
They don't need to prevent all citizens from using it to dramatically affect usership.

Sure, my point is that they don't have to prevent all transactions to dramatically affect transactions demand.  Most daily users - the kinds of people who will be needed to make Bitcoin a usable currency - will be dissuaded from using it, even if it is still technically possible.
Bitcoin leaving the country might not be affected so much, but then again, who would want to boldly defy the Chinese government?  I wouldn't think TOR would be a sure bet either, since the Chinese government might be able to control exit nodes on their network.
