An equally stupid idea to destroying the fungibility of Bitcoin, but yes, April Fools.

I'm sorry to have to tell you that your overall sales are going to suffer as a result of adding bitcoin as a payment choice. You may experience a temporary increase in sales, but any CC or paypal customers you might have attracted will drop off.
What's worse is that you're going to get a lot of penny pinching people in this thread asking you for a discount to use your already thin profit service(s).
I suggest you delete this thread and forget about it. You're hurting your brand and your core business by integrating bitcoin.
Good luck. Cool product and service.

It seems that you have no idea what Ripple actually does if you think bitcoin works better for transferring funds, or that custody risk, 3rd party exchanges, and data center mining are any better.

Oh come on.. It's a distributed network with a decentralized exchange. The innovation is the decentralized exchange/orderbooks, atomic transactions, auto-bridging, and rippling.

Thanks for referencing the wiki. You should also read it. Ripple Labs has no power to freeze accounts. The freeze feature is for gateways. Bitstamp, Coinbase, and other exchanges have the ability to freeze your account, and this is all the "freeze" feature does, but for gateways that issue balances. 
You have clearly never actually used Ripple. You're foolish to act as if you're an authority about what Ripple is or is not.

Not only have you not used Ripple, read the wiki, or used the network in any way, you have also apparently phoned it in on this point as well. You're wrong again, sir. I think you might want to just read the wiki, and do your own research, rather than keep listening to other "experts" who have also never used Ripple.

Hahahahahahaha.. Oh man, you've said enough. You don't know Ripple or consensus from the back of your hand.

Most definitely a coincidence. Not everything is a conspiracy.
