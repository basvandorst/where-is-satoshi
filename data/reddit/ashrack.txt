I am of mixed emotion about this ruling.  I agree it presents initial clarity so businesses can align to these guidelines and we could see more adoption of Bitcoin.  For non-Americans, this could mean a decrease or movement of mining activities, which could impact mining difficulties, or payouts.  It may also mean the big American money machine might dive in, so this could be of benefit. To the small businesses, most accept bitcoin and instantly exchange for dollars, so probably not an impact.  
  Where this is of more concern is the individual bitcoin enthusiast.  As I make small trades on Cryptsy or other exchanges, each transaction is considered a taxable event, and I need to not only track them, but their dollar values at the time of each trade.  Anything I purchase on Overstock or elsewhere with bitcoin, is something I'd have to report, even if it is a small thing.  
  Is the IRS going to go after me for the bit of FTC mining I do... probably not.  But could they audit me, making my life quite difficult for a time, find small value things I didn't report and fine me, yes they could.  So it's an annoying detail now that disinclines me from using my bitcoin more then I need to. And if that's the effect on me, then it may more profoundly impact new adopters to bitcoin in this annoying complication.

36, Information Systems / Support, Yes. 
I'll note that I believe bitcoin laid a foundation upon which the future shall be built.  I'm not convinced bitcoin is the destination or the perfect solution, but it's an idea.  And the massive altcoin market is the struggle for that idea to catch mainstream popularity on a global scale.  Bitcoin is paving that road.
