This is partly correct, but house values do change aside from inflation, because they are subject to the same supply and demand forces of the market like anything else (including the currency). Houses have historically risen in value faster than inflation, but that may not necessarily continue to be the case given the eagerness of central bankers to accelerate the printing presses.

Whenever you see the word "progressive" think "regressive".
Bitcoin doesn't need legislation because it *can't* be legislated. All that is happening is mass delusion in trying to convince people that the state is in control, when it has absolutely none whatsoever. It is regressive to think this is "fantastic" when it just lays bare the collective delusion statist morons are under.
Bitcoin doesn't need permission, just as you don't need permission to speak. A state can only take away rights. Nothing is ever granted by the state. Any legislation surrounding Bitcoin is something designed to limit expression of possible bitcoin uses.

UBI can't work because somebody has to pay for it. The idea that you can indiscriminately levy huge taxes the well-off is a myth - they will just leave the country and locate to somewhere more tax friendly.
This means you'll be heavily taxing the middle class to hand out freebies to the poor.

If we can add the Bitcoin B to unicode, surely we can add a new symbol for Satoshi's too.

So far the average channels per node is ~16, which seems like a reasonable number of channels for the network to continue to be robust and scalable. Ideally, this should stay around this number or increase, but nodes must increase also. Each new participant joining the network should be opening several channels.
You won't really notice the "significant impact on price" because this will happen gradually and not a single event. There will, however, be a point in future where the realities of Lightning being successful will be hard to ignore and the media will jump on it, which will cause Bitcoin demand to jump suddenly.
You really shouldn't waste your time waiting for the next bull market. Just focus on building and scaling bit by bit, and accumulate what you can. Treat bitcoin more like a pension or a 20 year bond. You are never going to predict day to day or week to week price swings, but you can be almost certain that the price will grow by magnitudes on decade timescales.

The way to make things better for people is to remove the red tape which serves only to restrict their opportunities. Elimination of retarded minimum wage laws would be a great starting point.
Socialists are all too concerned with the wealth gap between the richest and poorest, and seek to close it at all cost, even if that means the absolute wealth of the lowest earners declines. Everyone should be focused on increasing the absolute wealth of the lowest earners by increasing opportunities, demand for workers, which increases salaries.
If the top get richer at a faster rate than the lowest, who gives a fuck. Stop trying to steal other people's shit and take note of how your own standard of living is improving drastically as a result of capitalism.
Giving people "free" handouts for nothing is a fucking moronic idea which will only make the opportunity creators flee to somewhere which doesn't steal from them.

The bitcoin capacity is not important. All that matters is that the number of nodes and channels continues to grow organically. Eventually merchants will no longer be able to ignore the market for payments over LN and will jump on board too, which will cause more of their customers to jump on board, and growth will be inevitable.
Transaction value in Bitcoin is a completely useless metric. The majority of it could be people moving coins between wallets. Some of it is funding channel creation which is not the same as making payments.

Need to make the distinction between *active* channels and *public* channels. Channels can be private, and for all we know there could be far more that are not announced. If 7k nodes are known, perhaps a good fraction of them have private channels and the network is really twice as big as we think.

Use Tor for all communications. Put your Bitcoin through several coinjoin rounds using Wasabi. Exchange them for Monero with Bisq.

People won't do that because they're worried about it being stolen.

If bitcoin consumes 2% of all energy, and still generates a profit, it means energy is too cheap!

Yeah, the idea is you have both a loop-in and loop-out service, and the liquidity coming from one provides the liquidity for the other.
