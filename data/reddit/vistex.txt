The number of Bitcoin ATMs continues to steadily grow. There are [**3,541 such ATMs**]( installed throughout the world, and over 6 are put into use every day. However, just as criminals have targeted standard bank ATMs, they are now targeting cryptocurrency ATMs as well.
 Malware for Sale
Trend Micro has done some stellar cybersecurity research, digging into forums on the Dark Web. Postings concerning Bitcoin ATMs caught their eye. The security researchers note that criminals targeting standard bank ATMs have changed their game recently, switching from skimmers to using malware instead.
Now researchers have found listings of [**malware for sale**]( that is specifically designed to target cryptocurrency ATMs. A vendor was offering the malware for the price of $25,000. The malware exploits a service vulnerability, letting the scammer “purchase” up to 6,750 USD/EUR/GBP in bitcoins. The vendor notes that the malware does not require physical access and can be “maintained as a normal purchase with EMV or NFC2 pre-written card.”
Fortunately for those willing to pony up the $25,000 to buy the malware, the seller is including both EMV and NFC ready-to-use cards for the buyer to use. Even more surreal is that the seller notes that shipping times vary depending upon the buyer’s location.
One has to admit that the malware seller is definitely on his game. The entire package comes with a multilingual (EN/RU/DE) guide, and he even offers 24/7 Jabber support for every customer.
