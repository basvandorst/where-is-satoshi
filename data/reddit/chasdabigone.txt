The hardware wallet has your private key (spending password) and it is the only way to unlock the coins on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:26:43
They don't have much of an incentive to. They outsource the fees to the customers so the customers have to demand it from the companies.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:15:35
yes, people let nicehash be custodians of their bitcoins to use their service. This is an issue with Nicehash and their service, not bitcoin directly

"secure" is really not descriptive enough to make a decision to keep on coinbase or not. I'm sure coinbase takes security very seriously. You can think of it as the difference between having cash in your pocket or in your bank account. If your bank is holding your cash, then if it gets robbed your cash would be gone (they provide may some sort of insurance that will pay you back though). If it is in your pocket, you know it is right there but it can still be stolen directly from you.
Bitcoin is similar. If you let Coinbase hold your bitcoin then if it is stolen from Coinbase then it is an issue between you and them how and if you are reimbursed. If you hold your coins in your own private wallet, you are taking on more personal responsibility for the security of your coins at the expense of the convenience of Coinbase.

in case andreas reads this and was thinking u/hodIing wanted to suck his dick
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:21:32
the fees don't all go to miners, you can include a bunch of transfers in one transaction without paying individual fees... all the exchanges are making a ton from doing this
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:47:16
still a bubble
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:53:44
we just disagree about the primary use of bitcoin i guess
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:37:00
that's the point. there shouldn't be a list of things it is "supposed" to do. There's stuff it can do that nobody has even thought of yet. Make your own crypto if you want it to be restricted
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:41:37
agreed. Nobody should be able to decide bitcoin's use cases after the fact like this. Create another cryptocurrency to be whatever standard-bearer you want. Bitcoin was made to be ALL of the things that it is, whether you think it should be or not

plenty of room in the market for exchanges to make a better experience. As fees get higher then the market will innovate off-blockchain solutions

@_date: 2017-03-12 18:25:03
I agree. If SegWit is such a great solution, it will be no problem for everyone to migrate to the hard fork. If the solution isn't actually needed then the market will reject the SegWit fork. SegWit is a solution that exchanges could provide off-chain as well, with trust being put in the exchange rather than requiring all holders to give up security. I don't care for BU myself, although a blocksize increase seems necessary if you think low fees are important (I do not). In fact, it seems like this whole debate is based on some idea that fees have to be low. They don't. Exchanges can allow you to send BTC for less than the fee and package them all into one/multiple transactions. They don't do it right now, but they could. That's what I mean about exchanges being able to provide this stuff off-chain
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:26:05
I don't like that they denied it, but after reading their ruling I do agree with it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:36:26
hard fork and let the market decide. anything else leaves the protocol too vulnerable
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:52:11
yep, it should be and should always have been a hard fork

i understand, and i am telling you that makes an audit of Tether meaningless to compare to an audit of Bitfinex. They aren't auditing the people, they are auditing the company. I'm just saying that Tether's audit has no bearing on a Bitfinex audit, so i'm not sure why you brought it up as a reason for them to release their statements (which can't be vouched for without an audit of bitfinex anyway)
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:10:27
yes, and no matter how many times you guys parrot the technical distinction it doesn't change what THEY mean
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:59:28
even the statement about the correlation of segwit signaling and price is ignorant and wrong, not to mention the subjectivity of the miner comment
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:37:28
Just listened to his explanation - he is completely right. You can never get it all on chain, it's a reality that we should face now and not later. It is the true path to decentralization. 
For those that want the explanation - it starts about halfway through the podcast.
@_date: 2017-04-01 01:22:55
i've done this a few times and it usually confirms after a few days
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:54:19
nope, i just mean that it's missing the point to correct me on a technicality that I already know about when i'm trying to provide clarification and context. I use the word parrot because I get the same response, and know I will get the same response, every time I mention that people call it a contested hard fork (and yes, we get it, it isn't an actual hard fork)
@_date: 2017-04-28 16:09:54
OP guy has it out for bitfinex and shills hard against them. I'm not saying he is right or wrong but he certainly has a bone to pick
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:10:30
this is not a good idea. The way we find the best solution is by everyone talking about their ideas and hearing why they suck/are good
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:42:08
So are you asking for a bitfinex audit, or a tether audit, or a parent company audit? Those are all separate things. I agree it seems strange that they supposedly have an audit of Tether and are not releasing it (if that was the purpose of the audit). You would probably have to get clarification from Tether. That doesn't really have much to do with an audit of Bitfinex though if they are separate entities
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:35:38
Yes! Glad to hear someone talk about this! Let the market innovate solutions to these other "problems"

I don't feel like I was scammed if I got the hashrate I paid for. I didn't pay for ASICBOOST software so why should I expect to have it?
There is plenty to be mad at Bitmain about without making up other reasons
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:41:52
I own a recent bitmain miner - does this mean I have ASICBOOST or I don't? The real question: do I still have the hashing power they sold me or is it 30% less?
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:30:35
speaking as a former auditor - it's good advice to wait for the audit to be complete before releasing addresses and statements. It will expose you to liability if something has to be corrected. Best let the auditors take on that liability if you will be paying them anyway. I know that opinion won't be popular around here... sorry guys
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:59:48
don't bother man, these guys are horribly brainwashed into thinking some evil man is going to get 51% and fork
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:24:56
debt to gdp ratio is why it is more likely now. That being said, other countries are in a far worse position. The exponential nature of the debt at this point seems unsustainable to me but that is a judgement you can make for yourself. The dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power without the system shutting down though. Kind of interesting

@_date: 2017-04-25 02:07:08

" An appendix to the July 2016 report shows $2 trillion in changes to the Army General Fund balance sheet due to unsupported adjustments. On the asset side, there is $794 billion increase in the Army's Fund Balance with the U.S. Treasury.  There is also an increase of $929 billion in the Army's Accounts Payable. This information raises additional major questions.  "
134 billion net journaled in fiscal year 2015 (929-794) seems to be the real number. Although the unexplained discrepancy between approved budget and fund balance increase shows that this is hardly the whole story
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:44:44
bitcoin is inflationary too
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:18:57
i think the more likely thing is they would steal bitcoin by decrypting the private addresses

"Monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the money supply of a country (or currency area)." we can both do this
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:33:53
price inflation refers to an increase in prices - it is also one specific type of inflation. Saying "Bitcoin is deflationary" is incorrect because it is referring to a money, implying monetary deflation, which is not happening.

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:45:03
the literal definition of inflation is increase in the money supply
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:11:07
that is true, but to call it deflationary is incorrect. In fact, the inflation rate of bitcoin at this time is higher than that of the USD money supply. It is the fractional reserve infrastructure surrounding the USD that makes BTC relatively deflationary to the total amount of debt created.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:40:52
roads brah
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:30:00
not true, the USD is inflating at a slower rate than BTC. It is the fractional reserve infrastructure surrounding the USD that makes price inflation higher than when measured in BTC

fyi for OP - what i would do is download the Mycelium wallet app to my phone, transfer the coins to that wallet using the paper wallet's private key (this way you won't accidentally leave change somewhere you can't get it), then learn about all this stuff and find out what kind of wallet you want and transfer the coins there once you are confident

There are websites that rent out mining processing power in the same way that AWS rents out server processing power. You can buy a certain amount of hash and direct it to the pool of your choice, or mine solo, in the hopes of making more than your investment.
