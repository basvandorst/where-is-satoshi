I'm not familiar with blockchain.info. Does it show that the private key belongs to the address you want? Or is it just the private key? 
Sorry, never really used that wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:43:04
Might be an issue with compressed vs uncompressed keys. 
Is the private key you get WIF encoded? (51 or 52 characters base58, either starting with a K, L or a 5, which defines whether it belong to a compressed or to an uncompressed address)
If it's not WIF encoded, then Electrum has no way of knowing to which address type it belongs. In that case, try to get the WIF encoded key from blockchain.info instead.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:23:40
One of your outputs (probably the change) is extremely small at only 867 satoshis. Depending on the minrelaytx value that Viabtc is using, they might consider such a tiny amount "dust", which means they will not accept the transaction.
Your best option is to simply wait if you're not in a hurry. But it's impossible to predict how long it's going to take until it gets confirmed, especially with such a dust-like small output.
@_date: 2017-02-24 12:04:31


@_date: 2017-02-21 17:25:35
Does Electrum generate the right address from the private key? (Do you see it in the address list in Electrum?)
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:59:01
Tip for next time: when manually writing down private keys (or passwords or anything of the kind really), always write it twice.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:13:23
Pretty sure you have the wrong private key then.

I just tested it, and it seems that Electrum only accepts WIF encoded keys anyway, and no other format. So I don't know what the problem is then. Maybe you have the wrong private key?

The hashrate number alone doesn't mean much. What matters (besides decentralization) is the energy cost behind it, and that correlation is constantly changing due to technological advancements and more efficient mining farms. It's even possible that the energy cost of mining could go down while hashrate is going up.

They have demonstrated their technical inaptitude multiple times, so I wouldn't put it past them that this is simply a bug. They did a big overhaul of their site recently after all.
Last thing you could try is go to  and enter the private key under wallet details, then scroll down and try the other key this gives you (either the compressed or the uncompressed one).
If that's not it, maybe contact their support.

BU is the most absurd and reckless thing ever proposed in this scaling debate. This is just an equally absurd and reckless answer to their increasingily worrisome threats.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:13:07
There isn't goint to be a fork. Nobody involved in this shitshow is stupid enough to go ahead with that.
That said:
1) Yes, you'd have the same number of bitcoins on the same addresses on both chains. You don't need to do anything in preparation of this. And nobody knows how much either of them would be worth.
2) That entirely depends on whether the BU devs are implementing the fork in such a way that the coins can be spent independently or not. This is commonly meant when people talk about replay-attacks.
3)  Any well-intended fork would implement replay attack protections to make it easier and less confusing for users. As it stands, BU is refusing to do that. So in order to spend them independently, you would have to jump through some hoops. I am not going to elaborate on this, because I think it's a waste of time (see my initial statement), and there are other threads regarding this topic.
See this blog entry by Electrum for more detailed information and instructions:

@_date: 2017-03-21 23:59:37
No. But it reveals the public key. This could be problematic if there are any exploitable weaknesses in the ECDS algorithm, or if the revealed public key exposes a weakness in the RNG used to create the private key. But afaik, this isn't the first message that has been signed from this address, so the public key has already been... public.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:34:13
No, because the address itself is a checksummed hash of the public key, and today's transactions no longer reveal the public key of the target address.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:38:20
What you could do is create Child Pays for Parent transaction. What sounds complicated is actually quite easy:
You just spend the unconfirmed bitcoins your received on 1JcqjSLm18amVpX4asCEGbAFv7H7mWSe72 and send them to a different address in your own wallet.
In that transaction you add a fee high enough to pay for all the unconfirmed transactions before it too. This will get it confirmed in one of the next blocks if the fee is high enough.
You might have to do some calculating to get it right and not overspend on fees. I could help you with that if you like.

It's a mining pool doing this as a promotion/charity/whatever. They supposedly will include your transaction in the next block they mine, even if you paid a low fee. You should not rely on this service to work, because it's a purely voluntary thing done by a single mining pool. It's not part of how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:43:23
You can't just simply double spend a transaction just because it's not confirmed yet. People telling you to do that have no idea what they're talking about.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:42:55
When you create a new wallet in Electrum it always asks you to repeat the seed, otherwise you can't even create it. Are you sure it's not just a different address in your original wallet? Have you tried with that password?

Completely missing the point. The incentives provided are such that such a scenario of mutual destruction is not in the interest of anyone, except a malicious actor with the intent to harm Bitcoin. So the fact that BU is pushing for mutual destruction like that reveals their true nature. And that should be enough for the rest of the ecosystem to recognize them for what they are and avoid this pitfall.

Sorry for the late reply.
In order to rebroadcast the tx, you first need to get the raw transaction format. On blockchain.info you can do this by adding ?format=hex to the end like this:
To broadcast it, you can use your own node, or a wallet like Electrum that has raw tx broadcast ability, or you can use a third party website that offers an API for it. A list can be found here:

@_date: 2017-03-29 10:57:11


Not really. What you're implying is that a significant number of people have stopped using bitcoin because of high fees, and that they are now using altcoins for whatever they were doing with it (buying coffee?). I highly doubt that this is the case to be honest. The number of people who are using altcoins for anything other than speculation is absolutely negligible. And fees are pretty much irrelevant for that use case.
The cheaper fees argument is just the excuse for the pump. Every pump needs a narrative, something to convince people that they're not just buying into a speculative bubble. It was exactly the same during Litecoin's last pump, when transaction spam attacks and full mempools became a topic for the first time. Exactly the same. But nobody started using Litecoin for anything other than buying and selling the pump, and there was no significant uptick in economic activity on the Litecoin blockchain.

Because the Bitfinex tokens are their own market, and they have their own price. You can buy more of one token than you can buy real bitcoins with the same money. I still think it's stupid, but that's the rationale behind it.

That much seems obvious by now. That's probably also the reason why nobody from the Core side is on the attendee list, because they're clearly done wasting their time. This meeting looks to be a complete farce.
At this point, I actually kind of hope that there's going to be a fork. And I also hope that this opportunity will be used to implement a PoW transitioning, even if it wouldn't be necessary. Jihan has overplayed his hand, and he has shown everyone how damaging too much miner centralization can be. I hope it results in him losing the whole pot now. While this would definitely not be pretty from a price perspective, it would no doubt be the best for Bitcoin in the long term. I've also got a catchy name for it: The Riddening.

@_date: 2017-03-20 18:34:04
I don't know where he has done that, but it doesn't matter, because your assumption that "economic and monetary principles" trump technical concerns in the case of Bitcoin is objectively wrong:
Bitcoin only has value in an economic and monetary sense because of a sound technical foundation. And this foundation does not just include the code, it inlcudes a whole system of incentives that are governed by a set of consensus rules. Even small changes to this technical foundation, even small modifications of these consensus rules can have large impacts on the system as a whole.
In that regard, BU is indeed the most reckless approach to scaling, because it jeopardizes the balance of this system. And anyone who says they can anticipate all the consequences of something as ill-defined as "emergent consensus" is either an idiot or a liar. Take your pick!
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:39:38
Which wallet software? Do you have the seed for the new wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:24:13
This is the first problematic transaction in the chain of 4 transactions:
It only has a fee of 0.000002 BTC attached, which is below the minimum tx relay fee set in most nodes, so it will get dropped as spam by almost everyone on the network. This transaction is therefore very unlikely to confirm.
The next transaction has a more reasonable fee at 120 sat/B:
But the one after that again only has a 0.000002 BTC fee:
Same problem as with the first one, it's seen as spam by most of the network.
Then the final transaction is the one you linked in your post which again has a reasonable fee.
So there are four transactions. The question is who made the first one, because they will get the bitcoins back should it not confirm eventually.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:35:29
We will never know if we don't try!

What is the suggestion? Spell it out. Nobody is going to watch a stupid youtube video just to find out what it's about.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:56:03
There's only two things you can do:
1. Wait.
2. Do a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction. This means spending the unconfirmed output of the transaction again wiith a fee that is high enough to pay for itself as well as the unconfirmed transaction (needs a bit of calculating if you want to do it right). In order to do that your wallet needs to let you spend unconfirmed funds of course.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:07:55
Not really. The non-HD wallet.dat stores a number of pre-made addresses (I think it's 100 addresses by default?). And if you're using a HD wallet, then *all* future addresses are included in it.
So you would have to create an entirely new wallet to send your bitcoins to.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:06:00
I forgot to mention: enabling Replace-By-Fee comes with a caveat. Because this will actually allow you to doublespend unconfirmed transactions (which is NOT easily possible with normal transactions, contrary to what other people are telling you), some merchants will not accept the transaction before it has been confirmed. So keep that in mind. This is also why it's disabled by default.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:12:22
A hardfork that results in two chains that both retain tradeable value would obviously be a gold mine for Shapeshift.

I'm sure there are others, but I don't have anything bookmarked, sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:02:05
Electrum should choose an appropriate fee by itself. Maybe you need to update to the latest version?
Or you can go to preferences and check 'Enable Replace-By-Fee' unders the Fees tab. This will let you increase the fees after you sent the transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:51:24
No that's not possible. You must have created it at some point, and apparently you entered a password when you did. Maybe try some of your standard passwords that you use for things like that.

@_date: 2017-03-29 11:56:57
I suspect that it's actually the wallet you created and wrote the seed down and the password, but you're not entering that password correctly.
One thing you could try is to restore your old wallet from the seed you wrote down and see if the bitcoins are in there.
Make sure you backup this "new wallet" you're trying to use now first!!
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:02:15
That's impossible to quantify. In my opinion, speculation and censorship resistant store of value are the two use cases that contribute most to Bitcoin's value. I know that's what I'm mostly using it for.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:06:14
Yeah you should be fine then.
If the transaction doesn't get dropped from blockchain.info's own node after a while, there would also be the option to export the private key of the original address (from the first transaction), and import it in a different wallet and send it from there.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:47:17
Okay looking at it a bit more closely, it's actually worse than assumed:
The previous chain of unconfirmed transactions are all using such a low fee that they are being rejected by most nodes on the network for being spam. This is making things a lot more difficult.
Who sent you the bitcoins? Someone you know? Because you might have been scammed.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:55:38
That would be a strange decision by them. But I haven't used it in forever so I don't know.

It is making me so very sad to see that a group that is so stubbornly opposed to a safe approach like that was able to gain such a large following, and do so much damage to Bitcoin. It's an alarming example (and history is full of those) of how populism often trumps reason and sanity.
People don't understand the intricacies of a complex system of incentives that makes Bitcoin work the way it does, but they sure as hell understand when someone tells them that the fees are too damn high! Then they get so ideologically absorbed by this misguided idea that they become willful soldiers in a war that ultimately destroys what they were hoping to preserve. Let's hope it doesn't come that far this time.
Thank you for all your work!
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:22:34
Completely agreed. This false sense of urgency has been the basis of the "big block" narrative for so long, and it's now being used to push the Core devs into making concessions that would be hurtful for Bitcoin in the long run, just so the BU side would finally shut up and stop threatening everyone with mutual destruction.
Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the long term scaling roadmap presented by the Core devs instead. It's really not that bad.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:09:12
It seems to me that Bitcoin is currently in an important phase of transitioning away from the influence of certain early adopters. They might have been instrumental to the success of Bitcoin early on, mostly due to being in the right place at the right time. But they don't offer anything to this ecosystem any longer, other than an over-inflated ego, and business interests that are no longer aligned with the rest of Bitcoin. Their self-important tweets will hopefully soon be a thing of the past. Good riddance, Erik.

In my opinion this isn't so much about the Dunning-Kruger effect, and more about people being mentally trapped in this narrative that they've created and held up for so long. They're entirely absorbed by the idea that they need to "free themselves from the evil blockstream", and the populism around this narrative has grown stronger and stronger over time. Then it really took a turn for the worse when a certain few demagogues have recognized an opportunity to take advantage of this situation, and seized it. They are now acting as instigators, spreading lies, misinformation and distrust, in order to further their agenda.
By now, is showing strong signs of a sectarian movement. This is even going so far that they are constantly alluding to their prophet Satoshi with random quotes from the white paper bible; taken out of context and interpreted whichever way suits their narrative of course.
They are no longer open to reason and logical arguments. Instead they've created a set of strong beliefs, such as that "hashpower is the only thing that matters because something something Nakamoto Consensus" (again alluding to their prophet). And no matter how often they're being corrected, they refuse to abandon their false beliefs. They are trapped in this sectarian movement, and they're constantly deluding themselves by ignoring or outright denying anything that goes against it.
Finally, the most genius move by the instigators was to implant the idea that altcoins offer a way to salvation. This not only allowed them to further divide the community, but it also added a new level of commitment for their disciples: because now they were not just mentally invested in this narrative, but also financially invested. An army of self-motivated zombie shills was born!

It's possible that it didn't propagate correctly. I've rebroadcast it for you.
Edit: And it just confirmed.
Looks like you've sent it using the blockchain.info wallet, and their node didn't send the transaction out to other nodes for some reason. Moral of the story, don't use blockchain.info as a wallet.

Makes no difference, unless you already threw your paper wallet in the trash after sweeping it of course. The problem with paper wallets is that if you spend them, you have to make sure that you know where the change is going if you don't spend the entire balance.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:51:51
Click on the 'Coins' tab, select the address that holds your unconfirmed bitcoins, right click -&gt; spend. Now send to another address of yours, including a fee that is high enough to pay for both transactions (the old one and the new one).
But now that you've used the ViaBTC thing you might just as well wait until they mine another block and hope that they include your transaction.

On the transaction overview page you linked, you can see `Relayed by IP 	Blockchain.info`
'Relayed by IP' shows the IP of the node that sent that transaction to blockchain.info. When you make the transaction with blockchain.info itself, it obviously doesn't get it from an outside node, so it shows its own address.

Easiest is to just rename the wallet.dat in the bitcoin folder in %appdata% (with the Bitcoin client closed). It will create a new wallet on the next start.
Make sure both your old and your new wallet are backed up before doing anything.
Then you can just rename whichever wallet you want to use to wallet.dat before starting the client. Not sure if there's a way to switch between different wallets in the client itself now, there might be.

It's all about different levels of trust for different use cases. For large transactions or as a store of value that doesn't move very often, I want as much trustlessnes as possible, and I'm willing to pay a certain amount of fees for that. When I'm making small payments for my morning coffee or for the parking meter, I don't really care all that much about trustlessnes to be honest, all I care about is that it happens quickly enough so I don't have to stand around awkwardly for half an hour, and that it's cheap enough to compete with alternative payment methods.

Like I already said, they'll either confirm eventually, or the exchange will have to resend. I'm pretty sure they'll confirm though.

Probably not, because the transaction from your exchange is about 20x the size of a usual transaction, so you'd have to up the fee suggested by mycelium significantly.
Quick calculation: To get at 80 sat/byte, you'd have to pay a fee of (4500+200)*80-50000 = 0.00326 bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-11-24 13:19:36
Exactly. But you can send the change to any address, it doesn't have to be the original one. As long as the fee included with that transaction is high enough to make it worth for miners to include both of your transactions.
Assuming your new transaction will be about 260 bytes, then the total size for both transactions would be 616 + 260 = 876 bytes. According to  91 sat/byte will get you to the top of the pile. So that would by 876 * 91 = 79716 sat fee = ~0.0008 btc for the second transaction.
Or if you don't want to pay that, you can of course just wait it out.
@_date: 2016-11-28 11:19:06
Alternative explanation: Bitcoin had a surge in popularity in India, triggered by their demonetization efforts. There are over 1 billion people in India. Mempool spike was less than 100k. So even if only a very small percentage of Indians (less than 0.01%) tried to transact with bitcoin during that time, then the mempool spike can already be fully attributed to (attempted) adoption. Unfortunately none of their transactions confirmed or they were told to pay fees that they can't afford, so this surge in popularity faded away pretty quickly.

It doesn't necesseraly have to be the change output. If you sent the bitcoins to your own wallet, you can do a child-pays-for-parent transaction by sending the unconfirmed bitcoins to a new address. Or if you sent to someone else's address instead, then whoever received it could to the same if they want to speed up the confirmation.

The priority estimation shown on blockchain.info is obsolete. The priority mechanism was essentially abandoned with Bitcoin Core 12.0. Unfortunately blockchain.info is completely incompetent, so they haven't noticed yet.


No, that's irrelevant (in fact, older coins used to get higher priority before Core 12.0, but now it doesn't matter anymore). 
The only thing you did "wrong" was set a fee that's too low. Your transaction size is relatively high at 616 bytes. That's because it takes 3 inputs, and because Armory is using uncompressed keys which make transactions slightly larger as well. 
The best approach to solve this for you is to take the output from the change address of that transaction, and send it to a different address of yours with a high fee. This is called a "child pays for parent" transaction, where if the miners want to get the high fee from the second transaction, they also have to include your first one. Just make sure that the second transaction has enough fee to pay for both, not just for itself.

A trustless solution would be to create an nlocktime transaction that only becomes valid in the future (let's say in a year), and give that transaction to whoever you want to inherit your bitcoins. Worst case they have to wait a year to be able to access them. Also you'd have to move your bitcoins and create a new nlocktime transaction once every year.

The requirement for a fee *market* doesn't follow from this. All that's required is that the total value of fees paid is enough to incentivize miners to provide an adequate level of security for the blockchain. This can also be achieved by simply setting a minimum fee requirement, however low that turns out to be. Admittedly this requires some level of consensus regarding what this minimum fee should be, and a fee market might be a superior mechanism to arrive at that value. But it's not an absolute requirement to have a fee market.

When you're bidding for inclusion in a block, you can only see what others have bid so far, but you don't know what future bids are going to be, which will also compete with yours. But future bidders can see yours, so they have an information advantage over you and can therefore outbid you.
All in all it's just a very bad user experience. That's why a fee market should be avoided as long as possible (and maybe indefinitely). The block reward subsidy is what guarantees miner incentivization for now and for the years to come. We absolutey don't need this premature fee market, and it's unquestionably bad for adoption.

Yeah, sending a third, independent transaction to your change address and sending that out again won't do anything. You have to spend the exact input that came from the transaction that you want to help confirm. Sorry if that wasn't clear enough.
I haven't used armory in a while so I'm not sure if it allows you to spend unconfirmed bitcoins. I would have expected that it does, but maybe it doesn't. In that case, you could export the private key of the change address, and use a different wallet to create the child transaction. If you don't want to set up a wallet just for that, you could also use  to manually create and broadcast the transaction.
