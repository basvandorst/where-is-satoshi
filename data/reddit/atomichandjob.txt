A friend and myself got an email about this a few weeks ago, as we had pre-ordered Neptunes a month or so ago.  One of the reasons this data center is being built is to compensate people that pre-ordered the newest generation of ASICS in the event that they go past their shipping deadline.  In the event that that happens they are providing people that ordered new miners with free hashing power/hosting equivalent to what they would have had had their miners shipped on time so that people that payed 10,000 dollars for each of their new miners don't get screwed out of any mining uptime.
Edit: No shit they are doing it for profit.  They are a business.  businesses try to make money.  It's not like they're going to run the machines until customers get their miners and then burn it to the ground.  I really don't understand why it's a big deal either way.

I'm sure that refunding all of the constantly sold out orders for Neptunes and saying "Sorry guys our bad, better luck next time" would do them a lot of good from a consumer relations standpoint.  I'm not saying that they're not going to use the data center for other reasons, but being a Debbie Downer about everything gets really tiring.
In the short-mid term, even if they aren't doing it for altruistic reasons, it's being used that way anyways, so really, they are.

If you think optimal value for 1 BTC is $1 you're either trolling or on drugs.  Did you even think about that for any length of time?
