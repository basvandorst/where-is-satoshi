Here's a sub from 2016 titled: ELI5: Why did Satoshi originally implement the temporary 1 MB blocksize limit? How would this limit prevent spam attacks at the time?
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:59:15
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:39:02
That's an interesting question and will go down in history no doubt.
I coined the phrase 'altcoin'. Pardon the pun.
Actually I didn't.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:47:25
My question is would Satoshi approve.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:35:20
No, you will not have to change it as long as you have control of the wallet. I advise you to add ETH and other alt coins too.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:02:17
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:49:49
Sounds great!
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:36:39
I know people who hate when there's no comments added. What was the thinking behind the 1MB limit?
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:56:30
You will expect to pay 5%+ on the price on LB.
For big amounts you will need to complete KYC/AML procedures on LB like provide ID  and verify phone.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:13:33
Which country are you in?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:13:20
Satoshi isn't stupid, he though it all through in the whitepaper, segwit is fucked up I think, there's variables that people haven't thought about.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:39:30
I remember when the phrase 'phablet' was coined.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:36:52
Spot on.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:43:02
Bro, it's a community over there like a community over here, of course people will vote you down if you say something they don't like.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:26:14
Coinbase is great, fees are high but the price of bitcoin always go up!
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:35:31
It's worth a punt right?
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:14:01
Asia is snapping up bc*sh, $699,941,000 volume at time of writing. 
I think they know the price is going to triple.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:41:12
It depends on how you look at it, look at it as rent. lol.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:45:25
Yes, the one you have the private keys for.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:42:31
But it the bitcoin price goes up? If it doubles in a year? 2 years? I'm in bitcoin because there's only 21 million.
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:31:41
Keep your private keys and site back and wait. Yes you can profit by splitting your coins but someone will lose out. There can be only one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:36:43
That might be the case but if you're doing it for an investment in the ecosystem and looking to save the coins for a few year then it's well worth it.
My other contract, with Genesis, is only 2 TH/s but I get a couple of satoshis every week! I really like them as a company so invested in a lifetime contract with them.
I bought the contract in Oct 2016 for USD $300 and have defo made it back and then some. Sorry, don't have the stats.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:16:45
Yes, actually I do have a couple.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:47:26
Wow! You're joking! $3k!
Might have to reassess my stance but at the time I felt I was helping the system and making coin too.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:30:07
Maintaining is the problem for a noob like me. Bitcoin.com handle all that so I don't have to, that's why they charge a small fee.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:39:43
Is it ignorant to come and ask if Bitcoin Cash is a part of the Bitcoin Legacy?
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:42:16
I've got 1 ETH on there so I'll be glad to get it back, the value has gone up.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:16:02
I will enjoy pure bitcoin, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:09:28
To the top.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:25:12
Use ShapeShift and accept loads of crytpos
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:37:02
It's funny that's Charlie Litecoin creator has such a big voice in Botcib, he created Litecoin to trade for more Bitcoin, therefore was the first scamcoin.
He will talk about Namecoin but that was a token to buy names on .bit domain.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:31:13
Nothing at all

Dear Btc-e users!
Let's refresh the list of main questions: 
The launch date of the new platform has changed - 15.09.2017!
Is verification of btc-e users necessary on a new platform?
Users can conduct the following operations without verification - trading on all pairs, withdrawal and deposit of funds through codes of the new platform (btc-e code analogue) and also deposit and withdrawal of coins.
Why do I need a verification?
Verification is needed for those users, who need to withdraw or deposit fiat funds through wire transfer, sepa or other payment systems, where identity check is mandatory. 
Can I withdraw my funds from the account at the day of the launch of the new platform?
Yes. 
After the launch of the platform you will be able to find info about main ways of withdrawal on your account. We have widened the net of our partners and agents. If you want to become our partner or agent (in your city or country), then write a ticket to the partners section  
Also new ways of fiat withdrawal and deposit will be available (RF, Ukraine, RB, Kazakhstan, Europe, Asia - any bank). 
Can I withdraw my coins from the account at the day of the launch of the new platform?
“ Please give us a specific answer about fiat. If I had all my funds in USD in my account, will I have the same funds + tokens on my new account, or coins + tokens?”
At the day of the launch of the new platform part of funds will be converted to tokens. There will be no conversion of fiat to coins. Recalculation will be made with a higher ratio than 55/45.
What will be the limits for fiat and coins withdrawal? 
All data about limits will be available on 15.09.2017.
What accounts must be necessarily authorized?
Accounts that were blocked before 25.07.2017 (when you enter the website you see a message “Your account has been blocked. Please contact the support”).
Accounts for which an email change is necessary.
Accounts where 2fa must be removed.
Accounts where white IPs list must be deleted.
Respectfully, Btc-e team

I'm not a newbie but dabbled with bitcoin here and there since 2010. I would sell my bitcoin now, check my history, I sold at a high and now it's going down.
Bitcoin cash apparently will go down toward 400 euro, I would buy that. This is not financial advice.
It's my opinion to buy bitcoin cash after doing due diligence. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:31:43
How is it in the wrong sub? This is a discussion, no?
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:08:41
Hold your horses young buck, Bitcoin Cash is a part of the Bitcoin Legacy (see what I did there) so should be discussed here.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:03:23
Download a wallet and import your seeds 
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:06:49
*Hypocrisy 
I respect those companies who signed the agreement and stuck to it but I prefer Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:37:18
Them guys you talk about are part of the bitcoin legacy, that Ver guy did a lot for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:54:58
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:17:43
Why is LocalBitcoins still running?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:12:37
I'd buy bitcoin cash, apparently it will go down to about 400 euro.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:46:47
Yeah right, you're just waiting for the price to be high enough to cash out.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:51:23
In 10 years time when bitcoin is 100k you wont be able to do much due to inflation/
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:52:14
Looks legit.
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:58:46
I'm shilling because I believe in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:27:11
Clark Moody one of the originators, check out his updated site.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:58:08
I do that, I hold until I need the cash for something or if I want to but sonething online.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:41:31
WTF is Segwit? Why corrupt the system with new protocol when it was working fine, increasing the blocksize is a fucking no brainer, that's how bitcoin intended to be.
Just leave bitcoin alone, it's fine as it is.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:18:48
No you have to do it in advanced
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:35:32
As I see it BTC is being taken over by some new people who are too smart and it's not right, well that's the narrative from the old boys.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:22:48
Cool, another dividend.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:30:00
Bitcoin is only worth what someone will pay for it.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:01:20
I think so.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:34:20
It will take value from BTC, BCC is standing on it's own two feet, check the price.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:33:43
I have faith in bitcoin old because I have used it for so many years and it worked, blocksize increase had been testing and working with no problems.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:28:56
Kraken is quite good but it's a bit slow for short trading but for buying bitcoin it's great.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:26:21
That train has already left, Adam.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:24:11
Bro, this shit has been going on for years, finally they stick the finger out and actually action a plan.
But now some want to stop with the plan but since the plan been agreed some others are going ahead with the plan.
Others thought fuck this, these clowns are long, lets just do our own thing and forked Bitcoin Cash, the proper vision of Bitcoin in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:29:29
You need something like Bitpay that auto converts the BTC in to money like dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:20:13
I'm not a trader so I wouldn't know.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:38:22
What was the need to create litecoin?
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:13:27
Bitcoin Cash has all the mining it needs, it's surviving. If other miners come on board the price of BCC will go up because miners will price the coins accordingly.
Think about it, bitcoin cash is standing on it own two feet and is valued at $700. Rationally think about it, it's a good investment in the free economy. Bitcoin was the first ICO after all!
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:02:16
By the time you get your coins to cash the price will go down further. 
I remember I sent a large amount of coins with a proper fee to an exchange, it took hours and the price I wanted wasn't there so my calculation were wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:48:34
Maybe the list is in date order.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:10:00
Some really interesting stuff, what do you think?
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:34:06
I used Bitpay card: 
You send bitcoin to the card and it turns in to £ or $ then you can use the Bitpay card in shops.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:22:28
Regardless of the politics, they support bitcoin. it's easy, all you do is send the coin to your card and it converts it to dollars or pounds. You can then spend it anywhere that accepts visa.
It's good if you have a mining contract.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:17:20
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:38:10
Traders are not patient, they like quick money, they cannot afford to wait a month to get their money out.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:10:51
Your balance is 0.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:55:28
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:49:09
Maybe i exaggerated 
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:36:15
You have a point.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:37:24
It is relevant
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:34:13
There would be too much fraud
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:40:17
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:39:31
I don't think traders would risk waiting days/months to get their money, they like the miners are after profit.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:01:02
That's not very nice.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:40:06
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:21:02
I really loved BTC-e.com, it was really easy to use and trading was quick, there was literally no lag!
I suppose best is the one which is safest with your money because MtGox was rated but it got hacked.
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:10:49
bbcash is a derogatory term and we should refrain from using it, it's like racism.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:25:44
Coinbase isn't an exchange, GDAX is. 
Bitcoin is a risky business for credit card companies and decline merchant services for most Bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:07:41
Bitcoin Cash will most certainly skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:21:30
I guess but there is money to be made 'short' trading coins, I've seen it done live when Litecoin was pumped from $1 to $5 (or something lik,e that)
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:28:59
Takes too long and price may change, not really worth it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:18:27
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:47:30
I agree
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:16:09
Once the 2x protocol upgrade (hard fork) happens BTC will grind to a halt, it will take weeks maybe months for you to be able to move your coins.
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:58:15
I had about 5 LTC which I converted to ETH. I've lost it now.
Will I ever get it back?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:11:28
I haven't had any problems yet with btce but I have log in problems sometimes then get a cloudfare warning then I need to put in my log in details again. I put it down to ddos.
I haven't tried to withdraw USD or EUR yet but BTC and LTC withdrawals went according to plan although the 0.5 LTC charge is extortionate.
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:03:21
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:44:12
I bought a Bitcoin, just one though. Traded a bit, made a few quid but then I got bored. I'll just leave it in a wallet and wait till it cost £1m.
:)
