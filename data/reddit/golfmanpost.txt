Yeah I didn’t get reimbursed if anyone was wondering. Did get rid of my 2 year old malware!

Yeah windows. You think if that’s the case then it’ll say this was all done from my IP address? And you think Gemini reimburses me? God I feel like I’m fucked

Yeah I’m an idiot for losing the 500 but I’m over that I’m really just worried about how I clean everything from here. Authy doesn’t send me an SMS though I just open the app and there’s a code with a 20 second timer. So how do I guarentee my texts calls aren’t being intercepted. Also how do I format my computer.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:09:00
No because I had to use it when I logged in moments later
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:06:19
So what’s that mean implication wise
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:42:41
They have access to my phone number? What do you mean like everything my phone gets? Or just my Authy codes when I check the app. And wtf is TOTP. And yeah I actually debated doing exactly that to my computer, shits fucked
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:08:18
No, I looked at the log says I bought some eth at a time when I wasn’t on the site 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:07:45
Yeah I did that immediately 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:23:55
Yeah i watched hella bootlegged movies. I asked if it would appear as having been done from my computers IP because then I can claim it was someone else but if Gemini says it was in my computer then they’ll say yeah sounds like malware fuck off
