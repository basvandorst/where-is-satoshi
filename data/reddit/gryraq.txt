I'm also running a full node. Don't need a  fancy server, just a dedicated machine that can stay on 24/7. I'm using a 5 year old comp.

Does cost me about 6.50$ in electricity according to my meter. And I do have it limited to up to 30 connections.

Can't predict if it will make people abandon mortgages.
But it would certainly make just saving money for large purchases more attractive since one would not have to worry about losing value to inflation...
