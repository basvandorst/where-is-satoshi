Well that’s because I am someone who has never read/heard his arguments for UBI. Don’t think my opinion would change after hearing his arguments. He’s not impressive and not that bright if were being honest.

Yes, your assumption is correct. I prefer President Trump because he’s actually delivered on his campaign promises. Being a “stable hamberder-eating, covfefe drinking genius” is icing on the cake, I guess? Kind of an immature statement by you.

Only way he can fulfill that campaign promise is by returning tax payers dollars. It’s not sustainable without increasing taxes. He claims to be a math oriented guy so he must know his promise can only fulfilled by increasing taxes on those who pay taxes while the benefits are given indiscriminately to everyone. Socialism in its most basic, mathematical form. Universal income is what we’re talking about. Sounds great in theory but when you’re taxes go up substantially in order to fund this government assistance program, everyone loses.
Bitcoin doesn’t need a Yang to succeed. He’s not worth the cost. Bitcoin will do what bitcoin wants to do. In time, of course.

Very good video - thanks for sharing. It'll be interesting to see how far the elites and globalists will go to disrupt the global markets.

It all depends on your finances. I’m sure 40 CAD won’t break your bank and is a good place to start. That’ll buy you some bits and will get you comfortable with using the Coinbase platform.

Coinbase is a good place to start. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.
