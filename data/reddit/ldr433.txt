The problem with just giving bitcoins to organizations that actually need fiat is they just instantly sell them with Coinbase or Bitpay which hurts the bitcoin price. The lower price in turn make Bitcoin a less attractive investment to new people and thus its kinda like anti-marketing. Sure you are adding someone new to the community but all they do is sell, never buy. Doge sponsoring Nascar is important because they are using old school marketing techniques to target a completely new and untapped demographic. Also, there has to be value in Nascar marketing otherwise brands like Coca Cola, Sprint, M&amp;M's or Nabisco wouldn't do it.

The problem is when you sue someone, you aim for someone with deep pockets. There is no way that Mt. Gox has anywhere near the amount of BTC that they owe. They would just declare bankruptcy and you would end up owing money for your lawyer and still get nothing. And you can't sue the founder since he is protected behind the company, hence the whole reason people found companies.

Thats a horrible deal. Its a rip off you will never ROI:
A huge part of turning a profit with mining hardware is selling the hardware itself. Cloudhashing you are essentially just leasing it so not only is it overpriced, you don't own the hardware and thus don't get the proceeds from selling it. Now is not a good time to buy hardware because the [Bitmain Antminer S2's]( which are 1 TH/S for $3899 just sold out.  9000 dollars is like 18 BTC. For that amount you could buy 2 Antminer S2s and get 2 th/s and have a $1000 left over. And you actually own it. If you want to buy cloud hashing, [CEX.io]( is a better deal because you can buy and sell hashrate instantly. You also actually own the hardware, if you buy enough GHS they will send you the hardware. Beware though as it is also overpriced compared to the rest of the market, just not as outrageous as Cloudhashing.

Bitcoin Days Destroyed is a better way to measure the economic activity level of Bitcoin. Volume is a bad way to measure bitcoin activity because someone can just send coins back and forth between wallets creating a ton of fake volume. Days Destroyed gives higher weight to coins that haven't been used in a while to negate this. To find the the days destroyed you simply take the amount of the transaction and multiply it by the number of days since those coins were last spent.

You still can't name one product, that can't be torn apart. The more I think about it, Apple's closed ecosystem is actually anti-innovation in a lot of ways. They regularly block and copy apps that are innovative. Case in point Bitcoin, the actual subreddit we are on. Apple blocks all bitcoin wallet and exchange apps. Why? because they are working copying it for their own mobile payments platform. Meanwhile Google and MS embrace and use bitcoin. Keep being a fanboy to a company that is dooming itself to repeating history. In future we will see who will be laughing:

Circle probably waited for the absolute low like stated above, and now are waiting until the price jumps to invite the masses. Its the only way a startup that hasn't made any money can afford to give $10 to everyone even with the amount of venture capital behind them. Say they bought 10,000 BTC at $400, that's $4 million dollars and it can handle giving 400,000 sign ups that promised $10. Since they are smart and waited a couple of weeks before inviting the masses, those same 10,000 BTC are now worth $5.7 million dollars and can handle 570,000 new sign ups.

Bitcoins infrastructure is actually rock solid, the problem is the security of the apps built on top of it. Until bitcoin users start getting smarter this will never change. Everyday I am surprised by the shady websites that people are willing to send their hard earned BTC too. These are sites that people would never ever put their credit card information into and yet they send their bitcoins to them blindly. And then they are surprised when the site gets hacked or when their coins get stolen. Yes the community should support bitcoin companies, but there needs to be some quality control. Everyday on here there is a post from some college kid that thinks that he has the skills to code a secure website because he just finished CS 200 and thinks he is ready for primetime. Since they haven't thought anything through, these developers then make posts on this subreddit like "What app should I make?" and get upvoted to oblivion by people who have no idea what the fuck web development actually entails. Then if you read the comments its full of app suggestions like "MAKE A NEW EXCHANGE!!". The beginner dev sees the demand and then tries to make an exchange even though he knows nothing about how to secure it or even how its economics behind it are supposed to work. The dev hacks together a somewhat working pre-alpha build, without unit tests or security audits. Since bugs are hard to deal with and the project has taken longer and cost more than expected, the frustrated dev then releases it to the public promoting it like its a polished project with the intention of fixing the bugs later. The community, just happy that they have a new shiny site to spend their coins, starts pouring traffic into the site in droves. Suddenly the dev has no time to work on the core problems and instead has to deal with tons of customer service/support that he wasn't expecting. Fast forward a few weeks and nothing has been improved, but the site is popular and making money so the dev thinks he has made it. Then a hacker notices a hole and steals everything, the embarrassed dev acts surprised and the community flips out. Then the entire process repeats and repeats. This problem is even worse in the alt-coin communities that are desperate for attention.
How to fix this? Its simple, stop sending your bitcoins to sketchy sites for quick riches and stop blindly enabling people who have zero credibility because they made something you want.

I had an M15x a couple of computers ago when I was studying game development and it was top notch.

In my experience it was well worth a couple hundred bucks especially when you are spending like $3k on a laptop. The thing was a tank, extremely well made compared to my classmates Asus ROGs and Toshiba Oosimos. It was the only PC I have ever had that had Apple level quality to it.

Inflation means that you will need more money in the future to buy the same thing because the value dropped. Since the US constantly invents money, you need more of it to buy things in the future. For example, a Ford Mustang cost about $2500 in the 1960s, today the base price is around $25,000 or 10 times as much fiat. With inflation you are encouraged to spend now, because in the future it will take more to get the same thing.
Since there is a finite number of bitcoins the opposite is true, over time the value will theoretically go up, aka its deflationary. For example, something like a Macbook that costs $1500 or around 3 BTC today, will probably cost way fewer bitcoins in 40 years. Thus it makes zero sense to spend bitcoins on a Macbook today because it will take fewer BTC to buy that same Macbook in the future. This is why you are encouraged to hoard.

Coinbase is the way to go in my opinion, I have had a bad experience with Bitpay customer service, but thats just my personal preference. Both companies have millions in venture capital behind them so they are your safest bets. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian was even an early Coinbase investor. 
You said in another comment that you want to keep some bitcoins but you need to pay bills in fiat. Coinbase allows you to instantly trade your bitcoins into USD, taking away any risk.  You can specify a percentage of Bitcoins to instantly exchange to pay your bills, while keeping the rest as bitcoins. Just go to the website, sign up, and on the left sidebar there are Merchant settings where you can set up your company. In your account you can make simple payment pages, barcodes and buttons. If you need something more, there are plugins for pretty much all ecommerce platforms and CMS's like WordPress and WooCommerce. If you need something for in person transactions, Coinbase [partnered with the awesome Square recently.](

Techcrunch Disrupt is the premiere venture capital conference/start-up competition. Getting selected as one of the start-ups is a huge honor and basically guarantees raising a big round of investment. The reason it costs so much is because going basically lets you network with a whos who of angel investors like Peter Thiel, Fred Wilson, Ron Conway as well as venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and tech titans like Kevin Rose, Marissa Meyer, Larry Page and Zuck. While its not a bitcoin specific conference, the fact that bitcoin is making such a splash this year is HUGE news, it means that the big time investors are seriously looking at bitcoin start ups.  This is actually way more important than any bitcoin specific conference because its putting bitcoin in front of the king makers. Its evidence that the bitcoin community has grown up from revolutionary idea to game changer.

Read the article, 99% of the iPhone came from it. Read the definition of innovation. Making something cool isn't innovative otherwise any product that has a billion dollar marketing campaign can be considered innovative. See: Beats by Dr. Dre, which makes awful headphones, then markets the crap out of them to a target demographic, thus making them cool even though they are $50 headphones in $300 packages. Is that innovative? No!. Google Glass is innovative, the Danger HipTop was innovative, etc. There is a reason that the top engineers go and work for Google and Facebook, while the top designers go to work for Apple.

Its impossible for you to know exactly how much was invested dollar wise last month because the majority of transactions happen not on exchanges but between people and businesses. Honestly my estimate of billions is not too crazy if you think about mining investments alone. KNC sold $2 million in Titans in less than 12 hours a couple of weeks ago. They also sold tens of thousands of Neptunes and Jupiters last fall. A ton of KNC's orders, and actually a lot of the big ones are paid via bank transfer. Each of these is a BTC investment and this is only one manufacturer. It doesn't count BFL, AsicMiner, AMD GPU sales, etc.
Furthermore, Coinbase, CEX, Blockchain.info and Bitpay alone account for $200 million in venture capital investments in the last few months.  They also pay their employees in bitcoins. Add in Circle, Gox, the Winklevoss twins(invested $100+ million themselves), Wall Street, China, Silk Road (and all of the current dark net markets) etc and that number begins to skyrocket. This doesn't even include the thousands of BTC small businesses getting investments. Or if you look at the group buy, securities and marketplace sections of Bitcointalk, at least a hundred million has been invested with fiat through things like paypal and atm deposits. Or everytime an alt coin is traded into BTC, it too represents an investment. Now obviously in some of the above cases, 100% of the investment wasn't directly into bitcoins, but a solid percentage is and when you add up the above, the number easily creeps into the billions.

You just defined refinement. Innovation is defined as the introduction of something new. You are right that it isn't the the same as invention but they are tightly coupled. For example, it was innovative when Blackberry added email to phones that beforehand barely had screens. They had to invent the techniques and infrastructure to do that. XEROX PARC was innovative when they saw that using a command line wasn't efficient. So they invented the graphical user-interface. Google was innovative when they saw search engines like Alta Vista doing things by hand and decided to invent algorithms and crawlers to index everything. Or self driving cars and glass. Apple on the other hand, reverse engineers things and then refines refines refines using existing technologies without adding something new. They are a usability company which is perhaps their greatest innovation. Watch Pirates of Silicon Valley and Triumph of the Nerds.

We are in the equivalent of the 1960s in terms of quantum computing. Universities, the NSA, IBM and Google have ones that kinda work but are the size of huge rooms and cost tens of millions. The cost and size will come down like it did with PCs, the real question mark is software. 
At the lowest level, computers today treat everything as on or off, aka 1s and 0s. Quantum computers have three states 1s, 0s OR 1 and 0 at the same time. [Watch this video]( it explains it better than I will ever be able to. As stated in the video, existing software development techniques don't work with the quantum model and have to be completely rewritten from scratch. 
Basically quantum PCs will need its Windows moment(where cost and usefulness collide) before widespread adoption. For regular computers it took almost 30 years to get to that point. Estimates for quantum computers have been for 20 years, slightly faster because we've already been down this road. ninja_parade nailed it in that in this amount of time bitcoin will have the opportunity to adapt to protect itself.
I estimate 10 years for your USB because at that point you quantum PCs will be common at large corporations and universities. You could probably rent time on one of these computers like scientists do with super computers today or just pay someone to crack it. In the meantime, just keep your eye on regular super computing, you may not even have to wait that long. Currently you can rent a supercomputer on [AWS for $1000 per hour]( For $350,000 in bitcoins its not worth it, but in 5 years when your bitcoins are worth millions, spending $50,000 grand to get access to them will be an easy decision.

While I agree you should turn your miners away from Ghash, I think the real problem is the lack of innovation by other pools. Of course more people are going to want to mine on Ghash when it has way better features than any other pool. Instant payouts, configurable workers, zero fees, merged mining of more coins, add more hashrate instantly, professional quality support, etc. BTC Guild has failed to change at all in the last year, and by comparison is a joke. It seems like every other pool is just content to slowly die instead of fight back. In order to really stop this from happening every few months, there needs to be serious investment by another company to actually compete. There needs to be a real competitor in order for change to happen and at the moment there isn't one that's even close.

You are completely wrong.
Market cap is linear to coin price. If the price dropped 20%, than the market cap would drop EXACTLY the same percentage. Its simple math. The market cap is directly tied to the current price per coin multiplied by the number of coins. Thus if the price increases by 5%, the market cap increases by 5%, if price drops 2.38% then market cap drops 2.38%. Again its LINEAR.
What you are actually trying to say is that, if you sold 20% of all bitcoins then the price would drop more than 20%. This too however is flawed thinking and has nothing to do with coin market cap. While I agree that this is probable that the price would drop, its impossible to predict how much because there are too many variables. 
For example. why did you sell your huge stash of bitcoins? Was it because something bad happened like a huge hack of an exchange or something good like you want to buy a mega yacht? If its the hack then yes, I would agree that the price would drop more than 20% because it would induce a panic sell off like what happened with Gox. But if its just you cashing out independent of something horrible, then I would bet that the price would actually drop less than 20%. Why? because as the price goes lower and lower it reaches more and more people's buy price. For example, when Bill Gates sold like 10% Microsoft when he retired the price didn't drop anywhere near 10% because there was nothing wrong with Microsoft, Bill was just cashing out.

Amazon wants control. Simply put the open nature of bitcoin contradicts what they really want, which is a monopoly on your online purchases. By locking customers into Amazon Payments, they lock customers into Amazon.com, AWS, and all their other products. Once they get your payment info on a site using Amazon payments, its now easier for you to sign up for their own services because you already filled out your credit card info, address and what not. 
The opposite is true of Amazon's competitors like Overstock and Tiger Direct. These guys are way behind Amazon in terms of users, order volume and infrastructure, and they see bitcoin as a potential way to chink Amazon's impenetrable armor.

I contacted support and they said that they can't do any refunds for Bitcoin transactions. It was pretty clear that I was the first bitcoin customer to ask for a refund. I was really pissed so I checked Namecheap's terms of service and it mentioned nothing relating to Bitcoin refunds. This is a blatant violation of Bitpay's terms of service which requires a BTC refund policy to be clearly stated on all sites that use the service. So I contacted both Bitpay and Namecheap support pointing this out, and they still refused to do anything. Namecheap said that it doesn't hold any Bitcoins at all; they immediately convert them into cash. They can't do anything about it because refunding in dollars would make them like an exchange and they "aren't set up to buy Bitcoins"(such BS). As for Bitpay, it was clear that they don't want to lose Namecheap as a client, so they didn't do anything besides say that they will contact Namecheap to make sure they update there terms of service. I honestly couldn't believe how bad both sets of support handled my situation. Even worse, I couldn't believe that no one at either Namecheap or Bitpay had thought through how refunds would work before implementing BTC as a payment option. You would think that they would at least keep a small amount of BTC just in case, but no, 100% of BTC is instantly exchanged.
In hindsight (it was like two weeks ago), I guess I at least learned to always read refund policies for Bitcoin transactions before I send any in the future.

You are oversimplifying things while hating on people who oversimplify things. There is a huge discrepancy in bitcoin wealth between early adopters/1% and the average bitcoiner. The vast majority of bitcoins aren't moved or traded, instead they just sit in cold wallets of early adopters not to be touched for years to come. The 800,000 thousand or so missing bitcoins may represent 6% of total bitcoins, but it represents a much higher percentage of "active" bitcoins.
For example, gold is valuable because the supply is low compared to the demand. Part of the reason for the low supply is the fact that a ton of Gold is held in places like Fort Knox and the US Federal Reserve. These reserves make the amount of actively traded gold worth more because the market knows that the US government will almost never sell it. If say the world's biggest gold company decided to launch 6% of the total amount of gold into deep space and go bankrupt screwing its customers, gold prices would skyrocket even with the bad press. This is because the 6% of total gold lost actually represents way more than 6% of the actively traded/available gold. 
If it turns out Mt. Gox lost their private keys and the bitcoins are indeed trapped, there will be a huge spike in price regardless of the amount of bad press coverage because there are now a lot fewer active bitcoins. While the bad press may hurt bitcoin short term in regard to new user growth, the total number of users does not matter. One wealthy person investing $100,000 is equal to 1000 users investing $100. Yes a percentage of customers burned by Gox will give up bitcoin because of this, but the vast majority of users have bitcoins/bitcoin based investments elsewhere and didn't lose 100% of their bitcoin holdings at Gox. Thus they continue to have a vested interest in Bitcoins having value even though they did lose some money.

3600 * $413(current price) = $1,486,800 per day needed in investment to maintain the price. While this seems like its a lot, its only about 0.028% of Bitcoin's market cap of $5,221,509,376. 
Since there won't be a halving in the next year, there only needs to be $542,682,000($1,486,800 * 365) invested over the course of the next year to keep a $413 dollar price. Again this may seem like a lot, but its easily attainable for a market as large as bitcoin. To put that into perspective, all it would take to reach that number is either all current users to invest a couple of dollars or one big wall street bank/hedge fund to go all in. 
For example, the huge spike at the end of last year represented BILLIONS being invested in a matter of two months. While an investment spike of this magnitude is impossible to predict and unlikely to happen again, it doesn't have to. Bitcoin has more users, more businesses and more awareness now than 6 months ago, and user-base growth is actually what matters. For each new person or business added to the community, the amount of investment per person required to maintain/increase price decreases.
