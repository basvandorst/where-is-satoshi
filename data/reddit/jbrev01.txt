I know right!  Two life sentences for programming, developing a website and creating a free market... and also trying to hire for murder.  So ridiculous.

I really don't understand how Ross' defense stands up by citing these corrupt agents.  It doesn't change the fact that there's overwhelming evidence that he was DPR the entire time and 'thought' he was murdering people.  Yet the defense cites that simply by the fact that there were corrupt agents working this case makes Ross innocent of all charges.  Ross' defense basically comes down to "I didn't do it, mom!" despite ridiculous amounts of proof and logic stating the opposite.  Yet all the pro Silk Road fan boys argue his innocence to the death.  Downvote away boys.

Sounds like this was created for inheritance tax purposes.  Your heirs can have access to your bitcoins after the government has removed its greedy hands from your pockets.

I agree, SR made bitcoin look bad and it's left a mark that will be here forever.  But I disagree in the way that people who do drugs, are going to get drugs regardless.  It's a lot safer ordering over the internet, from a trusted vendor, than some guy down the street with a gun.
I'd be a supporter for this guy if he didn't hire thugs (in his mind anyway) to go and torture and murder people.  Makes me sick to think about it.  But I still won't agree with the sentence they're about to give this guy.

Like his opinion matters - a guy going to prison speaking about a guy who lost a bunch of money

No please prove them wrong please... I already spent .01 bitcoin because I thought you were going to give me .01 bitcoin and now I'm in debt.  Please don't let this be true, please don't do this :(((

How did this idiot ever become an undercover DEA agent?  I thought they had to have at least a bachelors... And they paid this guy $150k / year??? Holy shit.

I was just wondering, when can we forget about this guy and pretend like he has nothing to do with Bitcoin?  Drug markets and Bitcoin aren't synonymous anymore...  Please, let's just forget about this f**** guy and move on?
