I just posted an article I wrote on this subject last week, seems we are on the same wavelength!

Funny that the article doesn’t mention the US. That is because Swiss bankers have been sharing bank account info with the US for years.

BAKKT, the NYSE’s crypto custodial and trading solution has listed plans of trading clients accounts against one another to create an SEC complaint exchange for crypto assets to please thd institutional buyers. NYSE’s parent company ICE was heavily involved in building the derivatives trading markets for the subprime loan market. ICE also was at least partly behind the collapse of Enron. I’d say it’s not too big of a stretch of logic to think that a company that was closely tied to both of the largest financial collapses in the last three decades wouldn’t create some new set of problems in the crypto assets world. ICE has a history of creating very complex derivative products and are known for trading commodities against derivative products, so to me it just seems like a matter of time before they seek profits in this way...

The exit tax rarely is invoked in practice, even for covered expatriates. Generally only triggered by deferred pension schemes (401k/503B/IRAs/Defined Benefit Plans, etc.) plus over $2m in net U.S. assets. I’ve only seen a few times exit taxes were generated in hundreds of covered expatriate returns I’ve supervised.

Unless they moved to Puerto Rico they would still owe tax on the gains when sold. The US taxes citizens and green card holders on worldwide income regardless of where they reside, so the other country not having tax on crypto is irrelevant. Only exception is PR bevayit is a US territory. However, if your friend is not a US person he would be welcome to move back with open arms and no tax due. Actually non-US investors can get tax-free capital gains on US-source income if they live outside the US too.

You don’t think I know that risk? I wanted to sell for a certain price in BTC, not 20.9776 or 19.098 as price fluctates, and that should be my right to ask for the price I want reflected in the currency I choose to accept. Until we have people thinking like this there is no real argument for Bitcoin as a currency, only as a store of value.

There’s another big problem on the horizon- it is only time before these banks take the step from trading client’s accounts against one another to trading client’s accounts against derivatives. Frightening thoughts as to how that could play out...

I’ve talked about this with a number of the top tax attorneys in the US and the consensus has actually been that LIFO is proper treatment for cryptocurrencies and FIFO would actually require an election to be made.

Luckily the current Fed is smarter. I was talking with several members of the Federal Reserve abd FDIC at Money 20/20 last week. I can’t share specifics as they were off the record, but very promising both from outlook and actions they are taking.

If the seller wanted to be legit they should ONLY accept Bitcoin for payment, and the price should be listed in Satoshis, not dollars. I see too little of that. I was thinking of selling a condo in Hawaii earlier this year for 20 BTC, but after I posted the company converted and  fixed the price in USD! I was so mad I pulled the ad...

When I clicked on this I was worried it would be another “faketoshi” Craig Wright post. Super relieved to see a node name!

All this article proves is that Faketoshi doesn’t understand the science behind modern wine production any more than he understands the applications of DLT technology...

The problem I have with BCH is the massive “real Bitcoin” propaganda campaign and all the negativity they have spewed. Not good for the industry as a whole. The truth of the matter is Segwit lowered mining rewards, and some of the sizeable miners were so set against adding Segwit as it would lower their profits that they forked the chain. The security concerns are all fluff. Since then there has been some great community development on BCH and it stands alone now on the tech side. However, the negativity has continued with Craig Wright and Roger Ver spewing all kinds of nonsense. And the idea of forking again to create a yet bigger block size is unnecessary and harmful to further split up an already divided community. We need to be attracting more community developers to open-source protocols, not confusing them with infighting. This does not help develop technology in the long run and allows proprietary tech to gain a foothold.

Hmmm I’d say Satoshi was Bitcoin Jesus whoever they were, the mystery supprts that. And Roger Ver is Paul the salesman spreading the gospel but getting too caught up financially, so does that make Craig Wright the Judas of the crypto space? ��
