And if it doesn't, you suck it up and take the loss. My point is that if you don't have the tolerance for big loss, you shouldn't be playing such a speculative game.

If you bought at 17k, and can't stomach a 50% correction now and then, you probably should get out of crypto ASAP and never look back. This isn't the first time, and won't be the last.

As a libertarian crypto bro, I gotta say I have very little sympathy for the people that have issues with this. If you leave your money in the charge of other people, you're gonna have a bad time. There are other places to buy, and other places to sell. If you buy on coinbase, move it out of coinbase asap instead of waiting for a panic. The entire damn point of crypto is that you don't have to trust other people to control it for you
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:27:58
Exactly. 
Credit card companies will take a hit, but they'll be fine too, for the same reason banks will: allowing people to spend money they don't have and collecting interest. If credit card companies and banks adapt correctly, they stand to make huge profits from cryptocurrency adoption.

So what you're saying is that some people might get hurt because of the choices they've decided to make with their own bodies, and that makes it so that someone else is somehow violating them? Is that right? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:28:09
I'm living on a planet where connotation exists and matters. The implication of the word "fraudulent" is that someone is being cheated, i.e. defrauded. Fake IDs do not inherently fit that definition.

 The USD has been getting weaker at an alarming rate. Something has to change soon, or it won't be able to keep up with the massive debt that the system has created which will cause a death spiral into hyperinflation.

It will slowly approach the old all time high, but once it gets closer it will speed up. Once it passes the old high it will go parabolic again until it hits its new high. Then, more big crashing and people will declare it dead when it drops to a crazy new low of $60k.

I'm implying that bitcoin has less purchasing power than the USD.
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:53:18
This isn't a loss, though. It's a gain that has simply become a much smaller gain. If bitcoin drops to 0, it becomes a wash. Without the introduction of new capital, there is no scenario where this could ever be a loss.

The white paper doesn't say anything about being a store of value, but the developers of BTC have had being a store of value as one of their main goals. That's why BTC may not necessarily be the true bitcoin forever; that will all depend on consensus.

The law of supply and demand will stabilize it. Fluctuations are normal, and good. It doesn't need to be manipulated to retain value, it just needs to be useful and have a finite supply.
Central banks will try to take over. I guarantee they have already made moves to do so. It's up to us to prevent that or we'll just have to stay the cycle over again when the tyranny becomes apparent, which it always does. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:53:13
He still has it. He effectively paid nothing for it. He's going to want it back if he sells it now. 
He has what he wants; it's just not as valuable as it once was. He still has an asset that is worth dramatically more than it was when he acquired it, and has recovered his investment. We're talking about the fluctuation of wealth over a short time period. Short term ups and downs only become losses if you panic and do dumb things.
Everyone agrees he could've played it better, but he's still in the game. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:35:53
I'm just trying to get people to open their perspective.
This guy made a bunch of money by selling some of his fiat, and then bought the same amount of fiat back at a fraction of the price. Now, he's nervous because the price of fiat has gone up significantly and he wishes he had bought more of it when it was cheaper.
If you look at it that way, it's no different than all of us who bought bitcoin in early 2017 and wish we had bought more while the price was cheap. The only thing lost was opportunity.
The lament is completely understandable, but if you alter your perspective, it goes from "I lost millions" to "I could've done better"
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:13:28
If course it can. There's no reason inflation needs to happen. Human nature is what drives us to grow wealth, not some control-obsessed bankers deciding what they want people to do.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:00:27
So what you're saying is that because you value a thing the most, and use that to determine your wealth, everyone else has to use that same metric as well?
Personally, I categorize my wealth into a portfolio, and those assets that have a use I attempt to grow as much as possible. I acquire bitcoin because it has a use. I also acquire fiat, because it has a use. If I trade these things back and forth, always gaining both, I don't ever lose. If fiat is too expensive, I don't buy it with bitcoin. Likewise, if bitcoin is too expensive, I don't buy it with fiat. Sometimes I do less well than I could have, but I never lose, because my perspective is such that if I ever make a trade that's bad on one end, I have no desire to make a bad trade with it on the other end.
Bad trades are only losses if either you don't actually want the thing you're buying, or if you make another bad trade to get out of your original bad trade. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:39:44

Good buy?
You heard him, everyone! BUY BUY BUY!
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:12:37
It all depends on what the goal is. Warren Buffett has the goal of accumulating dollars. If he sells an asset for fewer dollars than he bought it for, then it's a loss. As long as he holds it, he still has the thing that he bought, this there is no loss. If the thing that he bought loses value, it's still not a loss, it just became a poor expenditure. 
If the goal is to gain bitcoin, and you trade dollars for some amount of bitcoin, and then get that many dollars back for a portion of the bitcoin, you have made a gain.
Gains and losses only happen through activity. If Warren Buffett never sold or bought another thing, it would be impossible for him to have a loss or a gain. If you are just holding bitcoin, you will not gain or lose anything. 
*edit: Except that USD is inflationary by nature, so just holding cash IS operating at a loss, since the Fed keeps effectively stealing it from you by making more.

It's only a loss if you didn't get what you wanted from the transaction. The only reason this is a loss is because he sees it as a loss. Objectively, he now has more than he used to = net gain.

If you are investing in something as speculative as crypto, you kind of have to go on the faith that you made the right choice. When evaluating its performance, you have to assume that it will eventually become stable, so following the trends to determine value is important.
Bitcoin's expressed purpose (one of them, anyway)  is to become a good store of value, which means the closer it stays in price to its overall trend, the better it is at being a store of value with the assumption that it will still exist in 10 years.
All indications are that bitcoin will still have value in 10 years, and it will very likely be a higher value than it is now

The bitcoin price has been fairly stable lately. That actually means that as a store of value it's doing better than it was in December, though in a bear phase. 
Technologically speaking, it's working mostly as intended. There are some glitches along the way, but nothing game-breaking.
Bitcoin is doing just fine from my perspective.

That's right, it also doesn't mean stealing money from the non-consenting in order to inefficiently feed people, as long as they can fill out the correct paperwork. It means going the fuck out yourself and using your own time, effort, and money to do what you can to fix the problem.

I do want things, and I'm willing to spend the fruits of my labor to get those things. I would even be happy to pay for some of the things that the government provides, namely protection from people that are willing to take my things or harm me. I would willingly give money to fund those organizations. The fact that I don't have the option to forgo that payment us the thing that makes it immoral.
That said, morality is subjective. Something that is immoral to me may not be (and clearly isn't) to you. I don't think people should be able to steal my things in the name of "social order" but if you think that's okay, then I will gladly allow that to happen. My problem is not that the government exists, nor that they take money; it's that they remove the choice from the process. People are generally good, kind, and generous. In the absence of government coersion, government projects that have value would still get funded.

I choose to live in this country because in spite of its growing injustice and immoral theft of justly and freely earned assets, it's still the closest to free in the world. My country was founded on the belief that people have a natural right to their life, liberty, and property, so long as they don't infringe upon those rights in others. This country was brought about specifically because taxation is theft, and for the first hundred years or so there were no taxes on the earnings of individuals. That is the way it should be. That is the country I choose to live in, and I will always fight to bring the country back to what it was always meant to be. We've simply lost our way, and we can find our way back.

Taxation is compulsory. If you don't pay them, people with guns will come to your house and either take your stuff, or lock you in a cage. If you try to stop them, they murder you.
If taxes were voluntary, they would not be immoral, but they also wouldn't actually be taxes.

I'm assuming no such thing. The opposite, in fact. 
I'm guessing that the value of bitcoin will continue to be volitile until adoption picks up to some level that a consensus of its value can be reached.  I'm guessing that the value of bitcoin will continue its overall trajectory until that time. This means that (by my guess) the price will be several orders of magnitude higher than it is now at some point in the next couple of years. All guesses, no assumptions. 
What I'm assuming is that the value of the dollar will decrease, as evidenced by its entire history, and truly the history of all unbacked fiat currency. IF it decreases rapidly like Venezuela's currency has, then a million dollars per bitcoin is possible even IF the value were to remain static. 
Note all of the uncertain language; I'm not assuming anything that isn't unreasonable to assume.

Better chances than a Republican.
Chance of a Democrat that hates the candidate voting for a Republican is basically 0. Chance of a Democrat that hates the candidate voting Libertarian is much better.
The "wasted vote" argument is the reason that third parties don't ever gain a foothold. Not that the vote is wasted, mind you; the argument itself. One the case of New York, your vote is wasted anyway, so why not waste it on a candidate that isn't a complete tool?
