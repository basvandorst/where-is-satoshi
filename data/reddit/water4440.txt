The average annual salary in India is about $1.5k. 58% of the population lives on less than $3 a day. 23% on less than $1.25 a day.
The average annual salary in the US is about $44k. There is poverty here, of course, but it's just very different in both how extreme and how widespread it is.

Because phone scammers have literally nothing to do with Indian "tech people" except being Indian.

Do you know what a strawman is?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:21:54


If you think you need a "tech" degree to spoof a phone number, you have no idea what the field entails. Even if they had degrees, they're working in illegal call centers where none of what they may have learned is relevant, and the spoofing is not implemented by the individual callers.
These people have nothing in common with someone publishing apps.
It's not moral outrage, you're just wrong. If you wanted to talk about cheating being prevalent in the Indian University system, that'd be relevant to this discussion, but you just come off as ignorant and racist with this comparison.

Of course not, but it's pretty easy to see why it happens and it has pretty little to do with Indian developers.

There's a lot of poverty in India, you'd be cold call scamming random Americans too if one success could feed your family for months.

As a professional dev, it seems unlikely this guy made 79 commits to a repo that were all small corrections - if this was the case you should have PR'ed into your own repo and let him review it and leave comments before you commit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:32
This is true, but certainly not cheap enough to make many of them not impoverished, and the average income skew clearly illustrates why Americans are prime targets for Indian scammers. 
Outside of that, it's not really a competition.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:53:33
...but it wasn't relevant. You jumped in on a conversation about an Indian developer potentially taking credit for code that wasn't hers to talk about Indian phone scammers. They are literally only related by race.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:58:01


Then why talk about it? Unless you just like taking the opportunity to shit on Indian people, in which case you seem like an asshole.

By PR I mean pull request,, it's a good tool to use when developing with more than one collaborator:

I'm not an iPhone dev - prod binaries for the App Store include the git repo? That seems bizarre.
