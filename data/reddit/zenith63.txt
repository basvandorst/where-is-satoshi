I've used Cryptsy a lot over the last few months and haven't had a single problem.

Only 0.5BTC but strangely they verified my account this weekend, thought there was some hope!

It's very cool that something like this can happen through Reddit.  Not sure if it happens regularly or why more people are not impressed by it!
Thanks for the effort!  +10000 doge verify

I asked the lady responding to my ticket to come to this thread and help you out, they said they would, should be interesting to see if it helps!

Nobody can predict if the price will go up or down. Increased adoption will cause the price to increase, and every day there are more stories about crypto. But on the flipside there are plenty of things that could happen to cause a massive drop in adoption (US/EU wide legislation etc) which would plummet the price. It's a gamble that only you can decide if you're happy to take or not. If you do decide to take it, I'd suggest dollar cost averaging your way in. So buy 5% of you investment today, 5% next week etc until you are fully invested, this way you should avoid buying on a peak...

Typically 15 mins after I posted this I noticed a 2M DOGE withdrawal was stuck as Pending from Cryptsy for the last 4-5 hours!  Logged a ticket with them and had a response in literally 2 minutes, on a Saturday!

I frequent both and tbh I agree with you, is the place for sharing what other coins have achieved etc.
