I worked at a financial company, they had software pretty much ported word for word from ADABAS NATURAL to an ASP .NET web application.
Not once did they think of starting afresh, making a new system with relevant technologies, no they had to port the 40 year old code with a shitty transliterator which probably cost them more for supporting it than a new system would have.
Needless to say I left after a year.

This is the sort of thing some kid produces when they read up on anarchism and think it's the best thing with no cons.

The simplest transaction chain:
    Input Address =&gt; Transaction =&gt; Output Address
    Green         =&gt; Blue        =&gt; Red
So Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob and you should see G-B-R.
But you also see Yellow-B-R, which is Alice sending some btc to Bob but some to herself as well.
Some of the more complex structures like this:
Where you see many inputs(G) to one output(R) is usually a donation address.

I don't think any bitcoin supporter is upset the price is rising, but the ability to spend their coins with a fast confirmation is another matter entirely.

Still waiting for verification.

Same here, been waiting for 3 days so far.

I can't transfer coins without I'd verification which is taking forever.
