Good question, sorry I didn't include it in the OP. Currently connected to 8 peers, which has been average for me in the past.

I must be fucking retarded, nothing is working in my command prompt. Literally nothing. I can't even start firefox from the command prompt.

So what's the bottom line here, even with the expected flood of ASIC's into the pool of miners, we're still going to be seeing good profitability if you happen to get one of the BL ASICs?

let me get right on that /s

Phew. So glad I decided to back up my wallet earlier today. Had to go through and delete every last bit of metadata, but my client is finally downloading blocks. Thanks for all the help! :)

Pardon my lack of networking knowledge, but how would one accomplish this?

Yep, I'm a network partner. It's actually *very* helpful in the copyright department. I do this mostly as a hobby, so for me it's worth it to avoid copyright headaches. I also make a small, but useful, amount of advertising revenue.
If I were to move to donations only and remove advertising, it would make me very happy. I feel icky knowing that I'm subjecting my viewers to advertisements that neither party has control over in terms of content. That said, I would be constantly facing copyright problems. Small channels typically have a bad time with copyright regardless of whether they are violating copyright laws. (I hate IP laws)

Yeah, I realized the difference... It deleted my blockchain and it is now refusing to process any of the 200,000+ blocks. Guess my bitcoin is fucked :(
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:48:14
Thanks! You do the same!
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:20:23
Yeah, that's pretty bad. It would take months to break even on a 30 GH/s ASIC. So, the early birds get the worm yet again :/

There is *never* an upside to having what is mine taken from me without my permission.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:35:16
I got everything set up and I still have yet to load any new blocks :/
edit: now 75 blocks behind :(
This is new: "Warning: Displayed transactions may not be correct! You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade"

Thanks for the tip, I really appreciate it :)
This is pretty much my thinking. I'm currently locked into a contract for a few more months, but I've been contemplating going ad-free and running entirely on donations via bitcoin.
