Correct me if I'm wrong here - Miners confirm transactions yes? No miners = no new blocks = Bitcoin stops?... Seems like control.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:43:29
You don't need all the miners - Just enough that it slows down the system, causes fees to rise, a few emergency adjustments, and suddenly the panic sell-off and FUD causes new money to avoid BTC and go elsewhere. You'd be blind to think this couldn't happen...
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:18:01
And now more than 50% of the mining is done by a few pools in a China... What makes BTC better?
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:27:17
Do you? Or do you just post troll FUD without actually explaining what you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:58:34
No but it does mean that they can fuck around with the system (fees, transaction times, etc)... Didn't the BCH people hold your network hostage for like two weeks? Few hundred thousand transactions backlogged for awhile?

And now I have a coin that banks will use... And which plays nicely with various regulators... But there's crypto space for all coins, even ones without a real-world case use like BTC... 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:41:58
And prices would plummet as confidence in the system falls... And new money into crypto goes elsewhere because of the FUD caused by it... You'd be blind to think this couldn't happen.

How many more forks of Bitcoin are we going to see?... Pretty easy to create coins when you just decide to double how many of them are out there.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:32:24
I would rather a pre-mine coin with a case-use in the real world than something controlled by miners who can fuck everyone over
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:26:25
LOL because BTC has faster transactions and slower fees?....... /s. 
  
Just because you're the Altavista of crypto doesn't mean there isn't a Google coming to do your job better... 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:31:25
It's a compounding problem though - If the price drops faster than the coin can become profitable again, people are going to lose their minds... BTC is held up on the hopes that it will continue to perform well in the future. Besides "fuck the banks" it has no real use in the world.   
  
Unlike gold (whose value is reliant on our belief that it is worth something), BTC also has to worry about tech issues causing FUD leading to panic selling... There is a real threat of dominos falling one after another leading to a Bitcoin nose-dive without any market fundamentals holding up... Are people going to cry "HODL" if the coin dumps 10k in a week at the same time as transactions aren't being confirmed?
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:45:25
But what is the use case of Bitcoin if you can't do anything with it? FairX is set to make the BTC/Alt Coin pairing requirement for some coins obsolete... Transaction fees are far and away higher than any number of other coins (which are also a lot faster)... If people wanted a decentralized coin they could use something like LTC but, as seen on the price of that coin currently, I'm not sure that anyone but crypto purests actually care about a truly decentralized coin...

Apple makes phones and sells them... People use those phones, but Apple still has a lot of them... Does that make the iPhone a pre-mined shit phone?
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:59:52
It also means they set all the rules... Fees, transaction times, etc... And didn't you guys get held hostage by the BCH crowd awhile ago? Few hundred thousand transactions stuck in the pipe while those Chinese miners switched over to the more profitable coin?

Sure, if they actually had it... Not a lot of oversight in a lot of places back then. Similar reason why so many smaller banks in the US fell during the 1930s - They lent out more than than they had on hand, and when people went back for their savings (bank runs) the bank had to go bankrupt because they couldn't call in their loans
@_date: 2019-07-20 09:54:12
No one seems to remember what it was like when banks all issued their own currencies, often backed by nothing more than the name of the bank and the cost of the paper it was printed on...
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:58:13
Past performance does not predict future value?  
  
People didn't switch from Alta Vista to Google overnight, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen... Years later there are those of us who remember the joy of Ask Jeeves, but I'm not sure how many people would still choose to use that old tech.  
  
BTC continues to fail to adapt to the changing marketplace that is crypto, and as soon as 'shit coins that have never been tested' prove that they can do Bitcoins job better, faster, and cheaper (and there are coins rising up that charts that do just that), BTC will surely fall... Who knows how much or how fast, but it's not going to stay on top forever just because it was the first to get there.

HELLO FUTURE PEOPLE!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:21:00
As soon as strong alts get fiat pairs there’s little reason to use bitcoin... Institutional money isn’t coming.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:17:38
And yesterday... And last week... And most days since January...  
But this is good for Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:02:30
Drops a bit?... 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:18:47
Because an aging coin racing to the bottom will finally decouple from stronger coins and the whole market will start moving free of this dinosaur

If real life is anything like Cities: Skylines, you just tear down a bunch of buildings and build whatever you want till something works or breaks :P
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:41:14
LOL I was suggesting that LTC might be the better chequebook long term than BCH ;)
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:48:53
Do you mean BTC and LTC?
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:36:16
LMFAO... I want whatever you're smoking.  
  
Your grandkids aren't going to use Bitcoin for anything except a laugh in their History textbooks
