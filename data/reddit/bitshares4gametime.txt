The problem of 'vote buying' isn't a problem.
If a bad actor wants to sway the vote - do you think it's cheaper to PAY 1000's of people? Or run a media campaign playing on peoples emotions?
If I want to sell my vote, why shouldn't I be able to? I clearly don't really care about my vote, why would it be better for me to just vote for anyone. How educated do you think the average voter is on what they're actually voting for?
Ask any randomer, and I doubt you'll be surprised by their political know-how
