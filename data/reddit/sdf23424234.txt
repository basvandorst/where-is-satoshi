They should hire lawyer and have them send an official letter to Barclays.
Speaking in person to the tellers at a branch is unlikely to solve anything imo.

How do you determine the EURBTC exchange rate?

I'm curious; are you located in Iran? I see that your website hosting is through a US provider but registered to a Dubai client.. was that difficult to set up? How did you pay for it? Are you able to buy bitcoins on the regular bitcoin exchanges using the same banking arrangements? How difficult is it to transfer money from Iran in rials to Dubai and onward to the existing bitcoin exchanges? sorry if this sounds too personal.. just curious.

The deposit account is based in France - requiring SEPA deposits (instead of using UK national bank transfer system - which is free).
While this may save UK customers some money on fx fees, they will probably still have to pay ~£10 to make transfers into this account. 
Also, I worry that the banks will screw it up and end up doing a double conversion to EUR and back to GBP potentially costing more than just making a SEPA transfer to an EUR account. :/

They can speak to anyone over the phone just fine, and presumably have. Going there in person isn't magically going to change anything.

they may be required by law or bank policy not to tell you anything. If their client is being investigated, 'tipping them off' is a criminal offense. 
In such circumstances most bank employees probably aren't qualified to talk to you at all in case they accidentally tip you off, or disclose something they shouldn't have.. there should still be someone at the bank that is able/qualified to talk to you though (although I expect they'll say as little as possible).
It is a criminal offence for anyone to do or say anything that might ‘tip-off’ someone else that they are under suspicion of acquiring, retaining, using or controlling proceeds of crime. That applies whether or not any report has been made to Serious Organised Crime Organisation.  
I especially like their conclusion;
Conclusion 
The burden of reporting remains heavy and keeping within the boundaries of the offence of tipping off continues to be a real worry and, more than likely, a huge expense. The loss of the privilege exception from the old regime is difficult to manage and we are fast getting to the stage (if we are not already there) where not saying anything at all is itself becoming a form of tipping off
Pretty much sums up this situation :p
