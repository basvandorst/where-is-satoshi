It's cool that we kicked the tires on full blocks. Gavin overstated the ramifications early on, but it's not particularly fair to blame him. No one knew what would happen, and he saw a potential technical risk to the system. Announcing that is the right thing to do. I didn't see many people taking the other position at that time, either.
What I do know is, not having raised the limit at all is hurting bitcoin. Most people don't think about this very much, but the internet was huge and important because it decentralized information. Internet backbones used to be dial up, and usenet used to have all kinds of scaling problems. We solved them. Not by limiting the system and designing solutions to perceived future problems, but by optimizing incrementally.
If we had kept an artificial limit on the scale of the internet for years, something other than TCP/IP would have overtaken it. 
The same thing is going to happen with bitcoin. Just like the internet decentralized access to information, bitcoin decentralizes access to money. Both require a network effect to become powerful. An internet with 1,000,000 people using it is much less interesting than an internet with 4,000,000,000 using it. 
A 1m person internet gives you "all in one" semi-centralized internet services like compuserv and AOL. The 4b person internet gives you uber, skype, and reddit.
A 1m person bitcoin gives you all in one, mostly centralized services like Coinbase and Circle. The 4b person bitcoin gives you decentralized money on everyones' mobile phone and computer mainboard, with integration to every system, application, and service in the world, directly and seamlessly.
Keeping the bitcoin network rate limited is stupid. Just like full blocks didn't kill bitcoin, responsible scaling isn't going to kill bitcoin either. We've already solved all of the problems. 
At this point it's doing a lot of harm to its chances of survival and growth. Hopefully I'm not the only one who sees this.

If a webpage can serve up a JS file to let you manage passwords locally, or to control your private keys with bitcoin, I don't see why the exact same thing can't be done for OB, keeping your keys, history/profile/listing data private.

I don't think Venture Capitalists are harmful. I think entrepreneurs who take VC money and want to grow big with a pure cryptocurrency play need to be very clear with investors that they are betting on something that might take decades, and to factor that into their expectations on a return. If entrepreneurs are overselling a big vision to raise a lot of money, and then die because of a timing issue, so what? The VC's aren't exactly what I would call naive. If the timing had been right, the VC and entrepreneur would both be riding a herd of unicorns. People taking calculated risks in new markets is necessary and good.

I am curious to see their product. They have raised $76m over two rounds. The other companies that have raised this much are 21 Inc, who has both hardware in market, their own lightning network, and is pushing the envelope on the internet of things, Coinbase, which has done an awesome job building everything for bitcoin, especially onramps around the world, merchant payments, and now even building bitcoin apps, and Circle, who has done a good job trying to mainstream bitcoin, and has also become an international onramp and alternative to Coinbase.
Really excited to see what kind of positive contributions to the bitcoin ecosystem Blockstream will make with their $76m in funding. The bar is set pretty high.

We use service providers for much of this. In a nutshell, our spot exchange rates are sourced from a broad base of commercial sources and banks around the world, each of varying types and frequencies.
Major currencies are weighted towards commercial sources as they more accurately reflect the trading occurring in the markets.
We also have a “validation and fallback” in place through the primary service provider and rely on this so we do not quote rates that are clearly outliers vs. other major markets or simply null/invalid.

Will from bridge21 here. We're no more likely to get shut down than any bank doing US Mexico payments, but we must comply with whatever new rules emerge as well.
What's surprising is the amount of money moving from Mexico to the US, especially business to business. We'll see how this all pans out soon enough.

We spent a lot of time talking to potential customers (small businesses and individuals) who send money to Mexico. There was a lot of interest in being able to pay with cash or US bank accounts. There wasn't that much interest in paying with Bitcoin, at least for these users. 
If enough customers want the feature we would add it. Coincidentally, our old product was a bitcoin brokerage where the user kept custody of their private keys. Selling bitcoin using that product is not terribly different than funding a Mexico payment using Bitcoin in our new product, strangely enough.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:57:53
No, absolutely not. There is no 5% conversion fee. We charge the mid-market rate +2% right now and don't hide fees.

Will from bridge21 here. Right now it starts with the sender having USD. The process is: 
1) ID verification, 
2) link your bank account, 
3) enter your recipient and amount and hit "send"
We then:
4) take a withdraw from your US bank account to pay for the transaction, 
5) take out a small fee, 
6) buy Bitcoin for that amount of USD (in seconds), 
7) send the Bitcoin (in seconds),
8) sell the same amount of Bitcoin for Pesos (also in seconds), and 
9) deposit it into any bank account in Mexico (in a few minutes - with one Bitcoin confirmation right now).
It's an instantaneous international bank wire using Bitcoin. I hope that helps, and we're really curious to see where this goes!

We've talked about Canada and looked at the exchanges. There's been some turbulence with payment processing options there for Bitcoin, but it's definitely on our list. We're prioritizing our next Countries based on market opportunity. It will be tough to beat China. 
Still, if you have a demand for CAD to MXN, [contact us at one of these emails and let's talk.]( Canada is likely a much easier integration, so that's a factor too.
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:05:13
Correct. Strictly speaking, and deliberately avoiding any debate, I'll say that we are mindful of the political challenges around increasing Bitcoin's capacity and the risks these challenges present to our business model as well as the industry as a whole. We are in favor of both blocksize increases as well as augmenting the Bitcoin protocol to better support L2 networks at the same time, to the exclusion of neither.
If we cannot work through our differences on capacity, and Bitcoin's properties become such that it can only serve as a cost effective bulk settlement system for very large transactions, and L2 networks are not sufficiently mature to support our business and provide services that customers will pay money to use, we're watching alternatives very closely. If an alternative develops sufficient market depth and infrastructure in a given crypto-currency/banking system pair, and the energy to build the rail and technical debt we will incur is less than the benefit of using it, we'll use whatever rail makes sense for us at that time, and do so very quickly. 
All that said, we are optimistic that we'll overcome our Bitcoin challenges. I think we're off to a great start so far in 2017!

We do it for 2% at  with near real-time transfers. Of course, they can also do it by signing up for a brokerage, transferring money there (or otherwise buying bitcoin with USD), sending bitcoin to an exchange in Mexico, selling it there, and then withdrawing the pesos to their bank. Lots of options, which is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:09:57
We price at the mid-market exchange rate with a flat 2% fee at this time. We may alter the pricing after we learn from our beta. Our costs are different, we have two trades of BTC for sending and receiving fiat currency which may be executed on a partner platform or our own. We also have variable and fixed costs from our processing and banking partners for the services they provide. It sounds complicated, but in the end those costs are very evenly passed on to customers as a simple flat % fee with a small minimum transaction size.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:39:41


Can be instant? Not to my knowledge. Can you link that offering from their service, please?


We do via our back office, but so far no one sending money to Mexico has asked to do that, except for people on the forums who haven't followed through and sent transactions.


Care to link the Mexican law? Also, skipping the part where the user acquires Bitcoin in the US is not a fair comparison, as that is part of our service.


Not according to actual users. They don't want to sign up with 2 or 3 services and jump through unfamiliar hoops. And we are still cheaper and faster than using two or three services if you add up all the fees. Coinbase is 3.49% for instant buys, for example, just on the US side. You can't assume 0.1% for a high volume trader either. That's not going to happen for someone sending a transfer to someone in Mexico, even if they send frequently. 


Well, you are more than willing to put all of that on a web page and compete with us. May the best service win!
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:32:38
No I can't because we don't charge a hidden 5% fee.

Bitcoin in Mexico is growing but still nascent. That could change quickly, but I don't think we are there today without some bus. dev. work.
Noteworthy, there's a company Unipagos that is offering Mexico bank accounts with not much more than a telephone number. I've had a few conversations with them and I do not believe they have integrated Bitcoin, but they do accept SPEI deposits. They've done extensive integrations into point of sale systems and also bill payments in Mexico.
Removing friction from payments is interesting to us. If you would like to discuss further, send us a note at one of the email addresses [here.]( 
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:26:17
We can do that via our support team [here]( We have to ID verify the sender, but it's all possible in our API or backoffice. We haven't built it into our service because we haven't seen the demand. If enough people use that option we'll build it. Hope that helps!

From the same thread: 
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:04:11
Bank wires from China are better priced for large amounts. Typically you'll only pay a 0.25% commission and maybe $70 in wire fees (there's a fee on the US side too). The USD:CNH rates are very competitive too. 
China is better, but almost everywhere else banks will mark up the exchange rate much more than USD:CNH. The way to tell is to compare the exchange rate the bank quotes you to the one you get on google, then use your calculator to check the % they are ripping you off. It's usually 2-5%, and hidden in the rate.
Oh, and it will take several days, may end up frozen or lost, and the amount received on the other end could be very different. Good luck paying a bill using SWIFT. For extra credit, google "SWIFT hacks". Fun reading. I'll trust instant settlement over that 1970's payment system any day. Too many moving parts built on ancient technology.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:11:17
This doesn't sound correct to me.
[Coinbase charges a 1.49% fee for the US, sometimes more.]( It looks like you left that part out of your analysis. 
The total is 1.49%+1% or 2.49%, and that won't get you the Bitcoin instantly either, you'll wait 3 - 5 days. If you buy with a debit/credit card, it's 4.49%. 
So 4.49% is the total fee to have a service comparable to bridge21.  Plus you have to sign up with two different services, give a bunch more information like your credit card, and you still won't know how many Pesos will be deposited because of price changes.
We are .49% cheaper than the 3-5 day option, and 2.49% cheaper than the similar speed option, but are still faster, and guarantee the amount of pesos received, which you just can't do with the above. 
I think by any objective measure bridge21 is vastly superior service for this use case.
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:32:55
Why is it a waste?
If we only accept bitcoin directly and selling it for fiat this means we're causing people to sell. That drives down the price.
If we convert, we are buying and selling Bitcoin. That creates more volume on exchanges in different Countries, creates equal buy and sell pressure, and is therefore price neutral.
If you want direct bitcoin we can do it via our support team, however. I will be curious to see how many people use this option. I hope it is as many as people claim in this thread.

@_date: 2017-01-02 22:01:44


We use Bitcoin to settle instantly across borders.


There are two costs for customers, fees and the exchange rate. Most services hide a 1-5% fee inside their exchange rate.
Go to bridge21.io and compare our exchange rate with the other services. You'll see our total cost is lower in most cases. This is because we do not mark up our exchange rates.
There are a few services that are competitive with our total cost, but they typically take 2 days or longer to move the funds when you pay with a bank account. We take minutes. It's like comparing an email to snail mail.
We don't feel that hiding fees in our exchange rate builds trust in our brand or with our customers. I certainly understand why others do this, but that type of pricing isn't consistent with our company's values.

I don't think that Bitwala supports US ACH withdraws to deposit money into bank accounts in Mexico.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:50:50
Ah, I understand. Our ACH is pretty fast compared to most banks. We have next day settlement under a daily cutoff time. There is also delay for banking hours/days in both the US and Mexico on the receiving and sending sides, which adds some complexity, but yes, typically we're talking about a 24 hour prefund.
We'll definitely post important stats. Full disclosure, Mexico is our proof of concept. We wanted to be the first company to offer end to end real-time international payments using Bitcoin. We're expecting our volume and revenue to come from other places, like China. If you want more information, send us mail at our support link. We have a weekly and monthly update geared more towards investors and distributors. Thanks for the compliment.

If you run a medium or large business and have an account in both Mexico and the US with the same bank that can be very affordable. Is that what you are doing?
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:12:05


Yes, ACH.


ACH doesn't clear. That's a very common misconception. You assume good funds, but a return could come in many days later. Technically the ODFI (originating depository fiduciary institution I believe) is liable for 60 days. This introduces risk for us, so we need to be careful about knowing our customers and that their source of funds is legitimate.


The SPEI system in Mexico clears into any bank account in under a minute during banking hours / days. Real-time transfers are common in many Countries. The US is a bit behind the times. We're just now moving to 3x a day settlement with ACH faster payments, and it's still to be adopted by most banks.

Xtreme thinblocks is running safely now with at least 3 other bitcoin clients (classic, XT, unlimited) without issue. If core merges xtreme thinblocks, which is already well tested in production, the concerns around 4MB blocks disappear.
Xtreme thinblocks + larger max_block_size is the safest, fastest path to on-chain scaling without unnecessary moving parts and risk.

You got it. We're buying and selling Bitcoin to complete every transaction, including the bitcoin network fee (really). Partnerships like BitGo Instant make this work smoothly, but it works with confirmations too most days. 
It's not noticeable for normal sized transfers, but try quoting a smaller amount. You'll notice our exchange rate becomes really bad and eventually you receive 0 MXN. That's because it's really sending Bitcoin and buying/selling in two countries. We've turned bitcoin arbitrage into a sealed money transfer service. It's a pretty cool project, and if you send money to Mexico, well it's a huge money saver when market conditions are right (about 1/2 the time). If/when we can enable money flow the other direction, it will always be better than everyone else offering money transfer. Just switch directions!
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:40:09


For instance, Coinbase has had problems in the past where they have withdrawn for a trade twice. Who wants that kind of risk with the account they need for paying the mortgage and car payment, for example.
I can't speak for Coinbase, but we've implemented with our banking partners correctly. We (once or twice) accidentally paid our very first customer twice in the very early days, but we've never double debited a customer for a transfer. We have checks and processes in place to prevent that from occurring.

Yes... We regularly have 21:1 or even 22:1 exchange rates. Sometimes it goes the other way of course, but if people are buying cryptocurrency in Mexico and selling it in the US, we get ridiculously good rates and pass those along. Our customers fuel the principal and we let them take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in what looks like a money transfer/FX service. We don't front run our customers orders, and disclose our fees/FX markups (currently we do not take a piece of the FX, which is why people are getting money printing level deals with us).
