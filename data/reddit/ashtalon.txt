So just to show this with some numbers, say I want to buy 1 BTC. Exchange rate: $447.94AUD. Add 10% GST to that which is $53.75. I'm now paying $501.69. And then they actually deduct 2% from the bitcoin you buy so I'm only getting 0.98 BTC for that.
$501.69/0.98 = 511.93 so that's the effective exchange rate. It's too bad that the taxation ruling has had this effect and that kills the site. At least I got my $5 for signing up, I think I'll just buy my coin with that and send it to my greenaddress.

Probs. BTCmarkets is pretty good though, direct exchange with other users if your sell/buy price matches. I'll probably stick to that.

I'll take a look. Signed up but have to verify my identity again, this time with a passport. Too bad I just moved house so my electoral details are different and all my documents are at my old residence. Damnit.

Hi Mick! I tried to sign up for Coinbase from Australia and it wouldn't work. What's the ETA for Coinbase in Australia?

Please do plan. Australians miss out on all this cool stuff the US gets. :(

That's right! The GST ruling says, I believe, that you'll have to pay GST both when you -aquire- bitcoin and then again when you -spend- it on a GST-inclusive item! It's insane!

I read the GST ruling, or at least almost half of it. It's incredibly frustrating. Damnit. Government, why do you have to ruin cool things?

The strings of his bitcoin wallet aren't tight.

Yeah, I'm using BTCMarkets. Thankfully no GST bullshit.
