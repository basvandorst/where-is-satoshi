Satoshi was definitely a history buff.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:38:51
Actually in the southern vernacular y'all is used as a plural of you. All y'all would mean all of of you. I know it doesn't make sense and I am not disagreeing with your post but as a Texan I feel obliged to comment on that particular point.
@_date: 2016-08-19 19:23:25
Satoshi was a genius at coding but yes he had a long way to go. Hal specifically stated he thought Satoshi was young due to the fact a. He made mistakes as if he was still learning stuff about c++  and B. Learned and attacked problems with only the vigor that a young coder can possess.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:56:47
The best part is when he says he can't self-educate. You live in the Internet age, dude.
@_date: 2016-08-19 03:11:48


Everything else he had to be a genius in to create it but the rest could be a fluke, a lot of those cipher punks had similar ideas he could have just read their stuff and had the coding genius to do it all. 
I mean guy was/is a genius more than most people yet realize but I'm not about the Satoshi cult of personality at all.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:29:16
He is just a silly guy. Fullstop. Getting so mad about stuff. If you really don't care about things your personality is not to sour. Satoshi Nakamoto could be arrogant but nothing like this guy.
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:57:41
I think he's a weird dude who checks the price of btc and is comforted by the idea of having wealth,  yet he has no attachment to it and is kind of seeing where life takes him. He may come out in the future, but for now he'd rather be able to take a stroll without everybody staring at him like he's in a zoo.

I don't know if there ever will be a mother of Bitcoin??
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:58:58
Exactly. People idolize him so much. An anonymous and intelligent man such as himself is probably very eccentric at best. We have no idea, he's just a human and nobody could possibly guess at what he or his life is like..... nobody can come close.

The supply is generated through math, solid cryptography.
The creator is the shadowy mystery and he SHOULD be unimportant, but people so desperately need a central authority figure to look up to and see as a face of any new concept.

Fella gets thanked here every few months. I think he gets it by now, wouldn't want him to get too big of a head.

Posting here to make sure I can find it when I get off of work.
Edit: Poop, somebody already solved it. Eagerly awaiting the next puzzle. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 17:01:02
I think this article is a joke. First time I've heard the McDonald's myth (which sounds like a joke.) and while I've heard the Irish grad student rumour before I've never heard the Hungarian one before. 
The Hungarian thing sounds like a reference to The Usual Suspects which is mostly focused on the identity of a mysterious and myth-shrouded crime lord whose origins are unknown and fantastical just like Satoshi's. The crime lord (Keyser Soze) is said to be Hungarian.

Very cool! I love it, good job.

@_date: 2017-01-13 02:42:55
Oh, wow! I am in student housing and didn't have a meal plan the last few weeks. Had some food to go from you guys using Bitcoin and shared it with a buddy who used to always talk about Bitcoin being dead and how I should sell. Made him eat those words. The UT roll is great. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:05:53
I remember back in the day when my only friends were my golden retriever and a man I would talk online with that I told my mom about.  We would talk about programming. I was home all day because I hated school. Got bullied like the dickens. I was an arrogant spaz with no social skills. Pissed myself on two separate occasions in class so I'd be sent home. Good times. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:43:08
R.I.P. he was truly a visionary. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:38:41
Hal had himself cryptopreserved? interesting, I never knew. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:56:33
This may just be a media circus to distract us from debate regarding Bitcoin but, I must admit I never get sick of this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 02:43:57
Ahhh, how embarrassing. Thank you.  
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:31:34
Agreed. It's not wise to try and meet your idols. He lives as a symbol instead of a real and flawed person. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:28:56
Indeed! Bitcoin is open-source and decentralized for a reason .

I  am Texan and I approve of this comment.
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:14:25
Maybe teens just have incredible foresight regarding Bitcoin. Satoshi was just a teen himself at the time.
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:45:35
Yep. I'm perfectly fine with how the word is used, myself.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:10:25
Yes, named after the creator of Pokemon. Haha.
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:38:16
I thought I was keeping up with the community well enough but I had no idea who this person even was.... that's not good.

This.

Hey now, I've known some pretty intelligent 16 year olds. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:36:33
I would say a combination of:
1. but don't deify the guy, he's still a human. 
2. Maybe some light crime when younger which could tarnish the reputation of bitcoin.
3. Just wanting to live a quiet life. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:38:10
Yeah, dude's a human being like all of us. He is as flawed as any of us, maybe even more so than most.
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:36:51
Haha, I would possibly buy that!
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:38:31
I agree. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:34:57
Absolutely. There is a danger aspect for himself and his loved ones, much like a superhero's secret identity. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:32:19
-Good at writing code
-Not good at other things.
He could just have a high-functioning form of autism, and want to be left alone. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:21:17
Well, I think you are wise. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:37:26
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:34:20
I would agree. Dude's not selfless but would rather satisfy a humble but large ego and not deal with the money. Being rich means not trusting anybody and if famous he has to deal with the pressures of being a public figure. This way, he can quietly be pleased with his praise and live a simple life. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:46:18
I really hope that "if you don't have time to understand then I don't have time to explain it to you." Or however it is p
hrased, is omitted. It is probably in there however, considering it is so many people's favourite quote.

I wonder if they knew that Satoshi Nakamoto is a reference to pokemon
@_date: 2016-07-10 06:56:11
The comment is deleted but it has to do with the Jewish people? I had a dream last night where a bird told me Satoshi himself was of jewish ancestry. Of course I also had a dream last night where I was an infant crawling around a riverbed when a giant leatherbound book fell out of the sky and crushed me like a bug.

Satoshi Nakamoto was named after him  and another video game designer as well. The Satoshi comes from there. The Nakamoto part was taken from the name Sinichi Nakamoto. Sinichi Nakamoto is more famous for creating Bomber man but he was also the lead developer for the Pokémon Trading Card Game for the Game Boy Colour. The whole thing is a Pokémon reference.

It could be that he mostly lurks and just posts small little comments. He could have that mindset John Lennon possesed when he wrote the song "Watching the weels."
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:16:31
I have been doing so for a long time but actually discovered the hodl meme relatively recently. I don't always have fiat to spend but the plan is to just hold onto my btc for a long time. Also, a big fan of this song. Was a big fan of his earlier work so when I found out he was coming out with a song titled Satoshi Nakamoto I was very pleased. It didn't dissapoint. Hodl.

Satoshi= high-functioning autistic recluse, I think. Also, bit arrogant. Not the dream person everybody thinks he is but certainly not the government.

"Bitcoin is for serious things that a shrink mind of a pokemon user can never imagine."  That quote is going to be really funny in hindsight one day...
