Coinomi 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:33
3-5 weeks and we'll be back. This is very similar to last January's dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:32:58
Hehe this 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:55:51
Look at the minimum amount to cash out, if you do some math, you'll probably have to watch like 100,000 ads to cash out. If you ever get to the min cashout, they'll send you  $10 in btc, and they'll walk away with $1000 in ad revenues lol
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:00:00
We do need to move to DEX's
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:33:50
naw fam nothing textbook about btc
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:25:57
mostly because BTC is the common trading pair
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:47:49
Geez yeah thats like a $30 transaction fee

I'd like to know as well. I thought it was created, and then let loose, without any outsiders able to edit/change it.

Lol yeah money is just paper. If everyone went to the bank and asked for their money in physical bills they could not do it. Your money is just a number online too.
Edit: charge your phone, less than 25% makes me anxious
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:36:58
I agree, diversify your investment. Do something lile 50/30/20  BTC/LTC/ETH. Or do some research and put like 5% into some other promising altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:00:02
Interesting idea :P

And imagine the technology in just 25 years from now. U'll be able to pick up parts from the Dollar Store and mine BTC for a profit ��

Mine it and hope BTC goes to 50K = profit. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:49:31
No one cares anymore
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:20:46
Try it out and let me know if it works?? :)
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:40:23
Adda boy!

@_date: 2017-09-09 02:24:41
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:52:04
For me i think it's more realistic for good altcoin to go from $5 to $50 (10x profit) than Bitcoin to go from $5000-$50000. So i invest only in alts
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:54:15

@_date: 2017-09-27 00:52:58
Not worried about it getting stolen?
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:27:20
Same with LTC! wtf coinmarketcap $75. Coinbase $85 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:10:15
Oooo then I'd keep hodling and watch the price skyrocket 
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:26:15
Same with LTC :(
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:20:54
You could also double or triple up and cash out, then retire 25 years early.. so there's that. ��
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:46:20
~2-4 weeks wait only

I think whatever price the first people to put them up for sale on an exchange for

Fake news
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:52:07
Sure why not?
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:58:52
Im sure people do. But not many, it's a hassle to have many exchange accounts, just to scrape up $1. Better to just buy and  
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:04:03
Ah ok cool!
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:14:10
Only what your willing to lose. 
If you want to risk working until you die, then yes :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:52:41
Yeah when you plug it into your computer ��
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:03:56
Atomic swaps is a solution too

Satoshi Nakamoto is Charlie Lee. He created Litecoin as a cover �� hidden, right in the open ����
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:56:11
