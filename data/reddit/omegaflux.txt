I think that's what a lot of my problem was. I looked up the speed test for mine and it was shit. Think I'm going to end up getting a Patriot Xporter XT Rage.

I was having that same problem as well. I googled "pip" since the page you linked to didn't give any details and found what it was. I installed pup from my package manager (Ubuntu based) but still couldn't install Electrum. Ended up downloading the Bitsafe distro with Electrum already installed.

Thanks. I think Eletrum is the way to go based on what I've read the responses in this thread. I'll uninstall the standard client I have now and see how Electrum performs on the distro I have on the stick now. I also found someone made [a Bitsafe distro that comes with Electrum installed]( but I haven't found any reviews so I might hold off on that for now.

That I couldn't tell you since I'm running off Intel, but the slashed circle does happen with other programs not designed to run on PPC.

You're all good. The link helped me know we were having the same problem. That was the page I was using to try to install Electrum and wondering why there was so little information for Linux noobies. I picked up Linux a few years back but switched back to Windows after some issues with my university's BlackBoard system. Google is your best friend as a newbie. As long as you're using a well established distro there should be multiple boards where problems you encounter have been resolved.

No, not to my knowledge. I had some Euros there after leaving Intersango when things went screwy. Unless they're willing to refund me dollars I'm just not sure what to do since I'm in the US.

That will be my problem, I'm in the US and I'm sure that the main withdraw option is SEPA which I couldn't get into my account.

I'm still waiting for my identity to be verified, though I didn't submit my info right away on the 9th. How long did it take you to get verified?

This is great and all, but I don't know where it leaves me since I don't have a Euro account.


Guess that means they won't forward my funds to Bitstamp.

Most banks probably have that option, I'm just worried that since I use a smallish credit union the option might not exist or I'd lose a decent amount to a conversion fee. It would be nice if they'd just let us direct our funds to wherever we'd like. I'd just prefer a SEPA to Bitstamp. I'd rather buy coins than lose money for nothing to international wire and conversion fees, especially since I've been losing out this whole time by having my funds frozen with them.

Wish I'd have known this yesterday before buying a $100 gift card, though I suppose I could do a little more shopping.

I still haven't received an email, but for those of us not in the UK who cannot do a SEPA withdraw, what other withdraw options were there?

Nice, but I'll be plenty happy one day when my wallet has enough to pay off my student loans.
