I interpret this chart, at this moment, to mean that there are a tremendous amount of people with sell orders at 150.  
And I also interpret that if 150 is breached, it will be a much easier climb to 160 and higher, comparatively.
To me, this reads like a bullish chart, but could a huge block of sell orders at 150 trigger a drop in price, or will it likely just bounce between 148 and 150 for a while?
What else is visible to those with more experience reading these charts?

Yes-- I could have been more clear-- student loans are not really so dischargeable-- In my case the student loans were only part of the debt cocktail, and not the largest part. Mostly credit cards.

Good lord.  Is this going to work?  What a nuisance. I'd love it if these people would just leave us alone.

I'm the idiot.  I managed to lose 65% of my bitcoins over the last month in day-trading, and then into Fiat today.  You can all thank me.

That's why he uses the language "what else would you call it but hyperinflation" rather than "hyperinflation." He understands there wouldn't be a rapid expansion of the monetary base, but, to the holder of BTC, the experience would not be dramatically different than traditional hyperinflation. One day, I could buy 20 gallons of gas with 1BTC, the next day it would take 200BTC for one gallon of gasoline. It would "feel" like hyperinflation, but obviously the mechanism is different.

Yes-- but this particular wall has been there for at least 6 hours, since price was in 130's

Yeah-- thankfully no family or even significant other. I'd like to think I'd have been smart enough not to get into this situation if I did have such.
I think that's the general plan--

I'm still learning--- what do you make of this chart? 
It seems like a huge amount of selling pressure happens at 150. Would that selling pressure cause it to bounce around between 148 and 150 for hours, or are there signs in this chart that suggest a trigger for a sell off?
Curious how you read it.

My dumb question: In a world where I have much of my money in a bank, it requires a signature and a couple of steps for someone to totally empty the account. 
I get nervous about a fantasy world where I have lots of money in bitcoin, and it can be stolen (and impossible to return, or be prosecuted by any police, etc.) by a mugger at gunpoint simply getting information from me, wherever I am.
Do you bitcoiners think about the fragility of bitcoin life-savings to muggers?

In this small market does 78btc constitute a big buy that can move the price?

Does a wall like that ever trigger a tumble?

Ugh.  Spartan against my will . . . 
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:48:02
Super painful. Ugh. I seem to be good at picking the bottoms though, so my sell is an indication of likely inflection. So: buy! :P

The problem is that watching closely doesn't help if you get a "502 Bad Gateway." Boo.
