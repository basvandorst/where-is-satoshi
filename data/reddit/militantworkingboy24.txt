I think BTC will rise in this recession. On average, people will have less to invest, but we'll make up the difference on volume, so many people will be looking for some vehicle to avoid getting their ass hammered by the system.
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:51:16
I think of BTC more as start-up gold vs regular gold and sometimes start-ups are so hot they can take off, even in a recession. That said, I probably agree with you until I see different. It's gonna be a ride either way.

So in this scenario a bank has the option of buying bitcoin and getting rich or trying to suppress bitcoin and maintaining the status quo?

It's a pretty amazing podcast. Well worth a listen. Essentially dissecting a British Bitconnect scam. It won't affect bitcoin at all. It'll have the same effect Bitconnect's implosion had. Nothing really.
