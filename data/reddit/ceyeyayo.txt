I want to make sure i understand the blockchain. 
You are telling me that SOMEONE stole $60 million worth of bitcoin from a third party server(NiceHash), EVERYONE(who participates in the blockchain) can see that SOMEONE had 60 million deposited to their wallet, but NO ONE knows who SOMEONE is?
Am i understanding blockchain correctly?

What is a hash, what is a block and what does 10 minutes have to do with it all? IM SO CONFUSED

it says it will be available on thursday which would mean im stuck at the price i paid for a week and cant sell. Is it because the market is so backed up with orders that its taking this long? I want to sell now, im panicking a little bit.

why does it cost a network fee of 15 dollars to send some coin to another wallet? i thought bitcoin was supposed to be all about p2p payments without fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:35:03
Did the bill even pass?

from 5-515pm Central standard time, it opened at 14,900 and closed at 16,300. This is a WILD ride. in 15 minutes the price increased nearly 1400 dollars.

my fear with futures is there could be some whales planning to short it big time using futures when it opens in what 12 hrs. this seems like the ideal time to short.
