Duh, just don't buy trafficked children and POOF, problem solved. /s

Building 11+ bedroom houses for extended family in the suburbs of Accra, mostly.

Fun fact, as recently as 2010 remittances to Ghana totaled more income than gold and cacao exports combined. 
Note that Ghana is among the top exporters for both gold and cacao.

They are no different is my point. 'Other-fying' never yields solutions, only war.

We have a sherriff and a few deputies, they keep things under control without becoming a Gestapo. I don't sing kumbayams. You're obviously racist against hippies; this town is mostly cowboys and ranchers, and no lack of resources either. Utopia is the right word.
Contracts are easy to uphold, but handshakes get the job done when everyone knows each other.

Nothing like a town full of ranchers and hills full of preppers to keep that shit at bay, eh?

Sorry, transphobic.

I see your point. Yet without our consent to their experiment, "they" are powerless. You can leave that little bifurcating experiment at any time, and see that in the grand scheme, your positioning, prisoner or guard, does not mitigate the mental damage caused simply by participating. Again, this is the first step to evolving past our barbarian state, and without it, nothing will change, no matter how many technological advances occur. 
Also, that example was proven to be cruel and unusual, with both "sides" effectively being brainwashed into devolving into their worst selves and representing corrupt socially-constructed archetypes rather than independent intelligence and rationality. Basing your view of humanity on such a setup is incomprehensibly limiting. 
Start with the humble, generous geniuses and work forward, the rest will catch up or die off.

Your "inescapable government" notion is your brainwashing speaking. Numerous societies have existed and do exist peacefully without manifesting an oppressive government. If you can't fathom it, I can't help you. So, sayonara. Enjoy your war, don't die too many times or you might get addicted.

If every human had to do every thing themselves nothing would get done.

This "Power" only exists in this pithy little society that is proving almost completely inept save for the work of a precious few, and is worthless. 
Many have "unplugged" to varying degrees.
Yes, if your dream is to be a banker, doctor, lawyer, etc, and live in a 2 br condo near downtown, you have no choice but to join the experiment and pick a side. I'll concede that. But, there are many other options.

"They" are "Us." Put yourself in "their" shoes so you can figure out how to get them into "our" shoes or this battle will last forever.

Hahahahaha run away? Every major coastal city at sea level is doomed to natural disaster (that's most of them), and the entire war-mongering society is sitting on a debt bomb and just-in-time food supply, it's the dumbest system I could imagine and doomed to failure. 
Leaving that is smart, not running away. My little town will thrive while the cities continue to writhe. 
Clinging to a sinking ship is no sign of strength or courage.

You seem unfamiliar with small town life, it's not Orwellian at all, even with a few bad apples. And it's too small to monopolize, oddly enough. I'd be down to discuss the solution I'm pursuing but you seem pretty convinced.
