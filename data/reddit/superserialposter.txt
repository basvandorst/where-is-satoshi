Ton is an idiot, you know that right? He rarely uses bitcoin, doesn't understand segwit, and debates people as if he were an expert.

Can someone give me the inflation numbers please, can't seem to find them.
How many mimblecoins will be released?
How many coins will be rewarded per block for the first set of coins?

Its not a simple block size increase. If it were there wouldnt be other improvements bundled with it. A simple block size increase is exactly that, nothing more. 
Yes most of the community doesn't want the other improvements it provides.
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:48:21
No you shouldn't of. You should of said the community is divided around it. Miners are a integral part of the system and their voice, whether we agree with it or not, matters. 
The reasons you listed are also heavily biased. You basically said that anyone against Segwit is biased. Thats not true. Spend some time talking with people who against it instead of putting words in their mouth.

His contributions to Bitcoin have been established, my question is what have you contributed? Who are you to judge him?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:11:59
Then why are we talking about Segwit. No consensus there?  Look at the comments in this thread, they are all FUD against r/btc, how can you say this thread is against splitting the network?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:20:38
You can't have LN without a block size increase. 1 meg cannot handle visa level transactions even with lightning network. LN still requires transactions on chain

Core has said numerous times that we need a fee market. You could argue that they are not trying to undermine bitcoin, but it is a fact that they believe in keeping the blocks small and fees high. I believe he created a slide with quotes that are easily verifiable

Roger Ver has done a lot for bitcoin. Funding the first start ups and educating people about it greatly helped its adoption. DjLyfe is accusing him of contributing nothing of value, so I figured it was fair to ask him what he has contributed
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:09:17
LukeJr has a list
@_date: 2017-04-15 03:09:02
This guy has been funding bitcoin related businesses and causes longer then anyone. What have you contributed exactly?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:08:34
Yes, you know better then anyone
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:34:39
It is exactly a scaling solution. It seems that you are of the opinion that it alone is not a good scaling solution, but this is debatable. It seems that we agree, however, it is a needed solution. Since lightning network needs a block size increase, why are we not implementing it? Both sides of the fence should be in agreement about this

How much hashing power does Ver own?

Read the comments satoshi wrote in the code. 1 meg was a temp measure to prevent spam. He expected a hard fork down the road
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:44:49
If you can't mention a single instance that he lied then you either didn't watch the video, don't know what you are talking about, or both. Which is it?
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:51:52
Satoshi invested in Bitcoin. Ver was the first to invest in Bitcoin startups.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:14:24
No this is how bitcoin was designed. 1 GPU is 1 vote

Etherium s market cap was higher post fork. Perhaps you are thinking about how much market cap they lost due to the 'hack'. 
Asciiboost isnt something that needs to be fixed. I'm not sure why you believe we need to fork bitcoin just to prevent it from being used. Segwit won't prevent people from finding similiar optimizations in the future and forking bitcoin everytine one was found would be highly problematic. 
Lightning transactions would reduce fees you are right, but we would still need to make transactions on chain. Lightning transactions would likely still require 2 transactions on chain per month per person. This means putting money into the lightning network at the beginning of the month and then closing the transaction at the end of the month. It is highly unlikely we would be able to afford less then 2 per month as most people live paycheck to paycheck. So the lightning transactions would be very cheap, but those on chain transactions would be very high. If the entire planet (7 billion people) wanted to use bitcoin and we had a functioning lightning network we would still need approximately 3 million transactions per block or a terabyte per block. Core believes in creating a fee market on bitcoin to move most transactions off chain, they say this often. The consequence is expensive on chain transactions which everyone would still need to pay.
You should open your mind to him. He likely saw Bitcoins potential before you and is pretty well informed. That doesn't mean he is right, but it does mean he is worth listening to.
@_date: 2017-04-14 16:37:42
What did he say in the video that was a lie?
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:41:16
Massive 1 terabyte hard drives lol! Do they still sell hard drives smaller then that? I think you need to learn a bit more about what you are talking about before opening your mouth

Segwit changes the way miners store transactions which can increase the number of transactions stored and allows the implementation of new payment methods built on top of bitcoin. Ultimately it will allow bitcoin to scale a little more.
Most people opposed to segwit do not like the additional complexity that it adds, or are against it for political reasons. A few are not against it, but are blocking it unless it comes with a larger blocksize as they believe bitcoin needs to be able to handle far more transactions per second. 
Some of the miners are using software that gives them a competitive advantage over other miners that would be lost if we implement segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:44:23
I have yet to see a single metric putting segwit above 50%. Mining signalling, node count, bitcoin votes. Would you like to provide a metric and source?
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:44:46
If the miners do not support it, then it doesnt have support from all of the serious players. This is called the no true Scotsman fallacy.

I've noticed the opposite with the ZeroBlock app. It is showing bitcoin in the 400s on the chart for the last several days
