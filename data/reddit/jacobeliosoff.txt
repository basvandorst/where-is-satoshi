Agreed they can't just give the order.  But leading devs could get behind a BU-style block size voting mechanism, and they choose not to.  Segwit was way, way more work - not that segwit is bad (I support it), but it's out because Greg &amp; Pieter &amp; co made it happen.

1. As I said elsewhere, I see what you mean about the BU page being misleading, in that it talks a lot about giving power to "nodes and miners".  So, yes, this obscures the fact that voting by hashrate means miners vote - not nodes.  Though as I said, they are quite explicit about "voting with hash power" on that page and throughout their site.
    One thing to keep in mind about this - "How can they brag about giving power to the people, when they're putting it directly into the hands of the miners?" - is that rightly or wrongly, many non-miner stakeholders are big-blockers who have felt more and more powerless all year.  That's just a fact, as you'll know from talking to exchanges and client-facing businesses like Coinbase.  So they may welcome letting the miners choose, if a) the miners' interests align with theirs (as they appear to *for now*) and b) they see hashrate voting as at least more objective than Greg Maxwell.
    So it's not totally crazy that BU might appeal even to non-miners as liberating.  But yes, I agree that presenting BU as "providing a voice to all stakeholders" (first line!) is laying it on kinda thick.  It provides a voice to miners, and, in some sense, to big-blockers.
2. Well the short answer here is easy: Ethereum.  Ethereum has [protocols/specs]( (unfinished though they are), multiple implementations, and a much more aggressive pace of change than Bitcoin.  I don't think any of those statements is very controversial, is it?  So I don't see any contradiction in what I said.  (By "solidified" I didn't mean I wanted a protocol that was *inflexible*, just one that was made *explicit* as opposed to merely implied by the reference implementation.  I know of practically no mature technologies that don't have a spec/protocol, or at least want one, and I expect Bitcoiners will eventually come around too.)
    In general I see Ethereum's development model as more long-term promising than Bitcoin's, especially in terms of pace of growth, which as a Bitcoin entrepreneur (and investor!) makes me sad.  But of course Ethereum has its own problems!  It is at least nice that they often err in opposite directions - should give them lots of chances to learn from each other, though I worry that Bitcoiners may resist adopting even the best ideas from Ethereum.

Great interview!  Thanks There's strong evidence for Haipo's claim that if segwit passes a block size hard fork will never happen.  The sequence post-segwit is predictable: some support a hf, others don't, devs say "It's up to the community" rather than actually rallying support for it, it's therefore deemed "contentious" and bam - no hard fork.  So I understand why he and other miners feel forced to use their leverage this way, though I disagree with him on many other things.
It's striking how much discussion there is of devs and miners clashing, vs how much their interests *overlap*.  Both sides agree that in the end users/the market will decide.  I think both would agree that a coin which becomes harmfully centralized (realistic single point(s) of failure, tx censorable by central parties) would lose to competitors, hurting the BTC price and thus miners.
The puzzle to me is why two interest groups with such aligned long-term interests can't reach a compromise.  If devs had supported a pre-segwit 2MB hf after Montreal, not because it was their ideal solution but because it was an *acceptable* solution that would build unity, then not only would rebellions like have been headed off, but decentralization would still be under control (no one claims 2MB is excessive) and much less time and energy would be needed to roll out segwit.
The stock response is "There is no official body to make agreements like this: Core is just a loose group of independent devs."  To that I would say, I'm not talking about group decisions, I'm talking about individuals.  Each person who says "Hard forks are too risky" or "Bigger blocks cause centralization" or (worst of all) the circular "It's contentious", when they could instead be saying "I support segwit and I can live with a 2MB hf - let's make both happen", is contributing to the deadlocking of Bitcoin.
All this talk about miners firing Core or users firing miners tends to obscure the fact that even if feasible, both are hugely lose-lose propositions.
(Btw anyone know where Haipo studied?  His English is great!  I wish these forums didn't de facto exclude so many other non-English-speaking stakeholders.)

Here's the crux of my cabal point.  Regular two-blocks-at-once forks are resolved by Satoshi's PoW algorithm.  We can all agree that Bitcoin would be much less interesting if instead they were resolved by a group of devs deciding which branch is consistent with the project's vision etc.  And yet we could decide max block size by PoW too, but are accepting the devs-decide way.  I understand the decentralization argument for 1MB, but the decentralization argument for *not leaving these decisions in the hands of humans at all* is just as strong, and with all respect for Core, you can't expect them to make it.
(And yes, agreed decisions in Satoshi's time were closer to a from-above technical meritocracy - part of why he's most missed!  I meant "the consensus algorithm from his paper", not "the way consensus was reached under him".)
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:57:20
I'm saying I know only two ways we can decide block size: a) let miners vote on it, b) only change it when Core, which largely means Core's leaders, get behind it.  a) has the risk that miners may choose a large size worsening centralization.  But b) also risks centralization (of dev changes/roadmapping), and additionally stagnation and infighting.
The risks for Bitcoin on both sides are serious.  Too many people pretend otherwise.
@_date: 2016-11-08 17:52:32
Yes, I respect that view, though I disagree with it.  I was just objecting factually to the "small-block-preferring BU nodes can get forked off" claim.
@_date: 2016-11-09 10:21:57
I suppose I might as well note that I'm more or less a big-blocker, and I do consider Core's leadership (Greg &amp; Adam &amp; co) something of a central authority.  Anyone can submit code to Bitcoin, but some defensible contributions will fail to get traction: that's just how projects are, they develop a culture around a particular vision, and leaders.  So to give a concrete example, if Gavin hadn't handed over the reins in 2014, the changes that got accepted (and indeed, roadmapped and advocated for) would be quite different: I'd be surprised if anyone would dispute this.
But unlike many big-blockers, I don't object to this top-down "technical meritocracy" model, or even to Greg &amp; co leading it.  I just disagree with some of their decisions - like not hard forking to 2MB+ before segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:19:22
1. First off, the idea that Gavin's true motivation for his thousands of hours is that sending Bitcoin payments "feels good" is preposterous.  But anyway, yes, you can count me as a bigger fan of the e-cash than e-gold idea, mainly because I care more about remittance recipients than about goldbugs.
    And I am just sick of the "wallets are getting fees wrong" excuse.  My latest delay was on blockchain.info.  If such a major wallet is still getting them wrong then that error is a predictable error a good plan would account for (and avoid/delay if possible), and people like Garzik explicitly did predict it.
2. Yes, well, we can agree that if you run the BU *code* in backwards-compatible Core mode, then of course it will behave like a Core node and prefer a split over accepting big blocks.  If you run it in proper BU mode it won't.  I presume the backwards-compatible mode was added to make switching between Core and BU behavior (eg, reverting) a config setting rather than running entirely different code, which makes sense to me.
3. Agreed.
4. On the "less invasive soft fork".  There are different approaches here, and I'd love to see them discussed more, if only so we all understand the possible moves in the game.  Eg, suppose big-block-supporting miners ran code implementing the following:
    - Include a block header flag indicating support for a future 2MB hf.
    - Once (say) 75% of blocks include the flag, refuse to mine on blocks that don't.
    - Once 100% of blocks have included the flag for some locked-in period (eg, 3 months), start publishing and accepting 2MB blocks.
    How might this play out?  Once 75% was hit, other miners (and Core) would see their blocks rejected (soft-forked off), and would be forced to either: a) bend to the will of the 75+%; b) *pretend* to, by including the flag even though they have no intention of going along with the hf; or c) hard fork themselves.  (Note that wallets etc would *not* have to make any code changes here.)
    So shortly after 75% was reached, 100% of blocks on the main chain would include the pro-2MB flag.  This is still just a soft fork.
    Once the 3-month locked-in period was complete, big blocks would start appearing and we'd see who really supported them and who had just been pretending to.  But given that miners have a much bigger (financial) stake in chain unity than, eg, Core devs do, both I and most miners might feel confident that at least among miners, the pretenders would be few.
    Just to reiterate: I don't support this, I'd rather miners, Core, and other stakeholders found a middle ground that avoided this kind of bloodshed.  But it seems doable to me, and there are many variations.  The broader point is that the power soft forks give the 51% to kick the 49% off the chain can be exercised in various ways, and gives miners more power than many appreciate.
5. AWESOME!  Even yesterday's short [CoinDesk piece on Chengdu]( mostly just whetted my appetite...
6. I'm all for public discussion!  But often some less-public chitchat is also helpful.  Faster and people can say what they think without having the Twittersphere tear every half-baked thought to shreds.
    My main concern about a truly decentralized, open, coalition-free consensus process is that basically no change will ever meet the threshold (let's just call this "Gavin's concern").  So you get stasis, which is arguably [where we are now]( (up to 13%...).
@_date: 2016-11-06 08:44:21
1. A lot of the debate about whether miners or other stakeholders "control" Bitcoin is simplistic.  Agreed that even 51% of miners can't just push through any change they want: I think we can all agree that if, say, they were to switch to code that stopped halving block rewards, increasing total future supply from 21m to infinite, other participants (nodes, exchanges, users) would rise up and hard fork, at the very least harming miners via the resulting price mayhem.  So even if miners *could technically* force through such a change, Satoshi's design includes healthy disincentives to prevent that.
    But there are many changes short of fudging with the fixed supply, and while some of the same disincentives apply, a 51% cartel *is* enough to push through some changes.  The obvious example is block size: without wading into the pros and cons, if we just focus on the practical question of whether miners could push through an increase, the answer isn't as simple as yes or no.  Among other tactics, 51% of hashpower is enough to employ various types of soft fork (eg, an ["evil soft fork"]( to coerce the network to a higher block size - that is, force other stakeholders to either accept larger blocks, or hard fork in unison.  If it ever came to a battle like that, there are arguments for and against thinking the miners would prevail.  Everyone involved would suffer from the price action and uncertainty; miners would suffer from alienating important constituents (who, realistically, would maintain the code if not Core?); and **if** the "defensive hard fork" worked, in the worst case for miners the result could be a new mining algo, rendering huge investments on their part obsolete.
    That's a big if though.  How likely is it that the non-miner community could quickly agree on one hard fork, especially given divisions within that group?  I'd argue that if 51% of miners unified around a non-crazy change (ie not increasing 21m), their greater cohesion (centralization, if you prefer) would make it likely that their chain would prevail and other stakeholders would end up accepting it.  This is of course a [hot topic at the moment](
    The point is not that miners are all-powerful (and certainly not that them ramming through major changes is desirable).  Just that they do have considerable power, and downplaying it is less productive than working with them.  In a decentralized system, takeover by one party is a risk, but so are civil war and deadlock.  Every participant should recognize the benefits of compromising with the others to avoid these lose-lose outcomes.
2. OP's whole premise is weird anyway.  Miners' whole business proposition is that through upfront (hardware, infra) and ongoing (electricity) **off-chain** investment, they can earn block rewards far out of proportion to their actual BTC holdings.  Why on earth would they want a shift to PoS, where they'd be reduced to competing on a level playing field with all the other holders?
    Miners not only wouldn't push through a shift to PoS, they'd quite understandably be the ones to most strenuously resist it.  In fact I see their strong vested interest against PoS as a potential long-term problem for Bitcoin: *if* PoS turns out to be workable and beneficial, other coins may be able to adopt it, but Bitcoin never will - existing PoW miners will fight it and, again, they have sufficient power to do so.
@_date: 2016-11-15 12:25:33
Good thought experiment.  As I argued before, I believe *technically* 51% of miners always have the power to force changes upon the main chain, through soft forks of various kinds.  Fortunately, if they push it too far (eg, if they tried to cancel the halving schedule right now), they face the prospect of a revolt by the rest of the community, which is lose-lose: hurts price, alienates devs, and could even provoke the community to hard fork a fresh chain (mining algo).  So normally incentives are aligned to keep them from exercising this power.
The miners are like (cliche of the moment) an elephant you ride.  They're mostly agreeable and often you can coax them: but if you anger them to the point where they disobey, they're going to do what they want.
If over time a large part of the community started to accept the researchers' argument - that the 21m cap needs to be lifted to keep the network secure - then that would make the situation more analogous to block size now.  Then it becomes more feasible for the miners to exercise force: there'd still be price impact, energy wasted fighting, alienation of devs, etc, but now they'd have a decent chance that most or all of the community would converge on their chain.  As John Blocke argued, once miners have 50+% and a decent chunk of the community on board, there are reasons to think their chain will win out.
It's not actually so clear that the miners would favor removing the 21m cap: even aside from the transition pain (market uncertainty etc), it would hurt the value of their current and near-future coins, and expose them to infinite future competition.  But the main point is that the miners do have the power to change the rules: only aligned incentives prevent them from exercising it.  Many non-miners seem to not want a system controlled by hashrate, but to me this is a fantasy - that's just how Satoshi designed it.
Conclusions I draw:
1. As long as devs release/non-miners run code that miners don't strenuously object to, aligned incentives will keep them running it and the network unified.  Eg, that's why no big miner has considered lifting the 21m cap.
2. If miners *do* strongly want a change, especially if many other stakeholders want it too, then refusing to run it risks provoking them to exercise force (or, as we're seeing, stonewall other changes).  This is quite likely to end up in either deadlock or civil war.
3. In the face of deadlock or civil war, we should strongly consider an automated algorithm for achieving consensus.  The BU mechanism is specifically designed to avoid both these pitfalls: everyone (running it) stays on one chain, even as block size adjusts quickly to the miner-majority preference.
4. The 21m cap is more binary than block size: the obvious states are a) 4y halving (status quo) and b) no more halving.  So I don't see the need for a fancy convergent voting scheme.  But if 51% of miners + a large chunk of the community ever support lifting it, the only real choices will be to either suck it up and accept the change, or wage a civil war I believe the miners would win.
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:34:48
I don't know.  Have they gone out of their way to provide that setting for non-miners?  Or just left it as is?
It's reasonable to underline that the BU approach will result in non-miners ceding some decision-making to miners ("voting with hash power", as they say).  In my ideal world, Core would adopt an algorithmic voting mechanism for block size and we could drop this whole warring off-brand codebase issue.  (Well, in my ideal world, Bitcoin is solidified as a protocol and we have multiple clients, but that's another topic)
@_date: 2016-11-09 09:15:59
I wasn't criticizing Greg at all.  I was making a claim about how many stakeholders feel, and that claim was true.  If you don't believe it, you need to talk to more of them.
@_date: 2016-11-15 09:31:53
I remember that (great) article, but of course there are many possible block size algos.  The interesting question is how we update the algo itself over time, in such a way that it adapts reasonably to network/economic conditions rather than just following some hardcoded progression.  One way is a voting system, and the only such system we really have is PoW - basically BU (well, PoS would work too).  The other is as you say: algo changes require manual code upgrades, and everyone who runs a node/miner chooses which code to run.
Given the difficulty that even a relatively uncontroversial change like segwit is having getting adopted (BU + Classic currently [&gt; 14%]( I see the humans-decide system as highly prone to getting stuck.  I think our main difference is I'm more afraid of that stagnation risk, whereas you're more afraid of centralization from the big blocks that the computers-decide system could produce.
@_date: 2016-11-07 16:07:25
Yes, maybe the researchers will win people over and we'll be having the same debate about 21m at some point.  After all, if it turns out they're right that fee-only incentives aren't sustainable, I hope Bitcoin *will* be flexible enough to change.  But right now, there is really no comparison between support for that and the level of community support, including among devs, for a block size hf.
As I said elsewhere, if it ever reaches the point where what's deciding Bitcoin's rules isn't hashrate, nor its community, then what does that leave?  Not a philosophy - a cabal.
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:45:32
2\. It's frustrating that you keep pointing out that the BU *software* can be configured to allow chain splits.  No one's disputing that.  My point all along has been to dispute claim that "with Bitcoin Unlimited ... If a node picks a block size that is too small, they will be forked off of the network."  I don't see any way to read that paragraph except as referring to BU configured *as its creators intended*, as described [on their front page]( and [in their FAQ]( (search both for "converge"): nodes get to choose a maximum "generate" size and a maximum normal "accept" size, but will accept even larger blocks if they make it some reasonable depth into the chain.
Of course there's still room for loads of objections about not letting miners vote on block size, incentives, code quality, etc.  But can we just agree on this factual point: that configured-as-intended BU nodes will in fact always converge on one branch (the most-work one), contrary to David's claim?  I see this as a central point in favor of BU, so it's worth getting straight.
4\. Perhaps a quibble, but I wouldn't describe what happened with ETH/ETC as "miners following the economy", because there is practically no Ethereum economy (users, companies, commerce) yet, and what economy there is was (and is) practically 100% on ETH.  What ETC did have was some buyers, and I agree that at least at the margins, miners usually follow *price*: so when ETC's price was 20% of ETH's, it predictably had ~20% of ETH's hashrate.  But I'd argue that Bitcoin mining is a more mature, businesslike industry whose serious miners are much less likely than Ethereum's to take a gamble (or an ideological stance) on a minority branch.  It's an interesting topic.
@_date: 2016-11-08 17:02:38
I'm saying that many (not all) decisions are better made by an objective algorithm than by people, and I've seen little evidence that max block size isn't one of them.
(Edit: I meant here "made by an objective *consensus* algorithm", which provably forms a consensus from changing preferences, like Satoshi's PoW.  Not a hardcoded algo like 2-4-8, which can't be modified after release without another hard fork.)
@_date: 2016-11-08 18:12:27
2\. Again, to call a node that sets [excessive block accept depth]( to 1,000,000 a "BU" node is exactly like calling a node that chooses backwards-compatible Core mode a "BU" node.  The *intended* purpose of that parameter is to ensure that if some miner spits out a huge block, it's not accepted immediately (DoS'ing the network), only if enough other miners (with higher non-excessive "accept" sizes) accept it that it reaches some reasonable depth (by default, 4).
As I said, I presume that their software lets you run in other modes just for convenience of disabling/reverting.  It's clear from docs like those I linked that a 1,000,000 accept depth is not the intended usage they're making convergence claims about.
The point that keeps getting dodged in this thread and many others I've seen is that *if* miners run BU as intended - leaving "excessive block accept depth" at 4 (or so), but specifying whatever "generate" and (non-excessive) "accept" sizes they please - then **yes, the nodes run in this manner will emergently converge on a single chain and never fork.**  Or prove this wrong!  But it's the convergence claim worth debating.
And again, yes, of course many people object to the consensus which would emerge.  But that's different from claiming as David did that it doesn't converge.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:48:24
A compromise is both parties giving up some of what they want.  This compromise was documented in the [Hong Kong agreement](  "This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB..."
If you were a miner who, after many hours of discussion, signed this agreement with some devs, and then months later they came back and said that as a "compromise" they were going to roll out segwit but not a hf, you would never in a million years say "Well, I guess that's a reasonable compromise."  You would say "Fuck these two-faced assholes."
@_date: 2016-11-08 18:51:46
Sure, suppose you're a miner and you start running BU, but then you decide the devs may actually be a bunch of incompetent turds so you want to go back to Core mode without swapping out the whole codebase.  Or suppose one of various inevitable glitches makes BU mode temporarily broken, so you want to go back to Core mode till it's fixed.  Especially if you've made various customizations to the code/settings (as many miners do), and want to preserve those while switching modes.
I'd like to hear the devs' own actual reasons, but as a developer it makes perfect sense to me to give users the option of changing/disabling behavior (especially, reverting to old behavior) via a config file rather than by swapping out the whole codebase.
@_date: 2016-11-08 17:46:53
I can understand opposing voting by hashrate as a bad idea, but it *is* a consensus algorithm (which is what I meant).  Even if devs agree on some hardcoded algo like 2-4-8, they'll risk a hard fork getting it out, and then again when inevitably revisiting it.  I agree with the BU folks that we should at least strongly consider a voting approach that lets us only do that hard fork once, and by hashrate is the only robust voting mechanism we have.
I don't see us getting much closer to agreement here.  You think (correct me) that changes to a key parameter like max block size should only be made with broad consensus across the community, not by hashrate, ie, a single constituency (miners); and if that broad consensus is hard to reach, the status quo isn't so bad.  I think that hashrate is a cleaner mechanism than the human alternatives we've seen (and that hashrate can win by force anyway); that the onus is therefore on its critics to show that it would lead to intolerable centralization; and that they haven't done so.
@_date: 2016-11-08 07:14:47
My "cabal" point wasn't meant to criticize anyone in particular.  But for many of us the idea of voting by hashrate is central to the appeal of Satoshi's design, not because it's particularly fair but because it's **objective** and (somewhat) resistant to Sybil attacks, external takeover, opaque politics, etc.  So when people talk about how "the 51% don't control Bitcoin" - who does then?  If, say, we end up in a situation where 75% of hashrate and most users/exchanges/businesses support a 2MB hf, and it doesn't happen - who is deciding that?  I see only two reasonable answers:
1. No one.  Each individual can run whatever code he/she wants.  And if the result is that the consensus needed for any remotely controversial change never quite materializes (when *won't* a block-size hf - which most Core folks favor eventually, in principle - be controversial?), then so be it, at least the system is hard to break.  I strongly believe this is a recipe for stagnation and being superseded by other projects capable of bolder technical growth.
2. A technical meritocracy.  Basically like Linus controlled Linux: I'm actually not at all against this way of running a project - I think it beats  hands down!  But let's call it what it is: this is not a free-form decentralized project open to anyone, it's a decentralized *technology* curated by a centralized *body*, who draw up roadmaps and make decisions and veto changes.  Based on the trust they've earned from the community, who of course have the choice to run someone else's code instead: but this is the vision of Bitcoin as Core's baby.
My own view is that the original Satoshi approach of achieving consensus via a technical mechanism (whether PoW or PoS) is nice and should be used, not for everything but when feasible, to avoid exactly the sort of human theatrics that have dominated the last couple of years.  And although I oppose the BU project, I support their central idea that since the network's block size limits have to be decided *somehow* by *someone*, better to hand them over to Satoshi consensus too ("from protocol to transport layer", as they say) than to the alternatives I listed: Sybil-prone "community consensus", faction-prone "technical meritocracy", or stagnation-prone "anarchic emergent consensus (or none)".
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:21:33
Some, like who?  Or is it safer just to not trust any of them for now?
@_date: 2016-10-30 05:16:36
Worth keeping in mind that all this theoretical wrangling about whether PoS can be made to work securely will probably be made obsolete by events in the next few years.  Either:
1. Ethereum releases Casper (by say 2018), switches to it, and doesn't suffer any fundamental PoS-related attack in its first year or two.  In this case most will conclude that as a matter of engineering, PoS basically works.  That is, spoofed histories etc aren't showstoppers but just more risks to be practically weighed against the various risks of PoW.
2. Ethereum releases Casper, it's fundamentally exploited/unmanageably complex, Casper fails.  Maybe people keep attempting PoS, maybe not.
3. Casper is never finalized (or Vitalik &amp; Vlad never converge on one scheme) and eventually the community gives up on it.
My guess is  but we'll see!  However it plays out I love the fact that a theory's workability is being tested the best way - by trying to make it work.
@_date: 2016-10-31 10:59:25
Thanks for the response Aaron.  Some of my comments (I'm also were not in direct response to you or but to the broader anti-BU community: loose talk about "firing" the "whiny" miners isn't hard to find.  But I'll try here to stick to things you two have said.
1. Weak adoption: imo people are taking far too much encouragement from $700.  Exchange spreads (my day job) clearly show that the rise is driven by Chinese store-of-value seekers.  It says next to nothing about Bitcoin's utility for *sending* value, and the feedback from those actually trying to send lately is very negative.  (Including me - it's not the fees, it's the unpredictable multi-hour delays.)  The door is open for Ethereum &amp; co to provide a less crappy user experience, and Bitcoin's dominance of customer-facing cryptocoin ventures is already less solid than it was a year ago.  But anyway adoption is secondary to this thread.
2. By BU being "consensus-preserving" I meant the big technical consensus - a single blockchain.  The whole point of BU is that all nodes running it stay on a single chain, since they defer to the majority block size preference - the "most-work" chain.  This is just a factual claim, not a value judgment, but if you actually disagree with it let's sort that out.  (It goes without saying that the *process of adopting* BU could lead to a split.  But *if* the community adopted it, it would prevent future block-size-driven splits, at the expense of allowing block size growth.)
    See also my original objection above to David's claim about small-block BU nodes being "forked off".  I still maintain that was just factually incorrect - again, preferences aside, we should be able to agree on these factual questions.
3. "If miners don't like segwit, they don't have to accept it."  As long as they don't mind doing validationless mining.  And thus potentially having their non-validating blocks rejected.  No, realistically, if segwit activates miners will need to upgrade (I have this on [very good authority]( I think this is reasonable, but let's not pretend they'll have a choice.
4. Miner power.  Let's suppose 55+% of miners decide to force through larger blocks.  What are their options?
    - The [evil soft fork]( Peter Todd described
    - Other [less invasive types of soft forks]( not changing the tx format (and thus not affecting wallets/nodes etc), but just forcing miners to concede support for a subsequent hard fork
    - A full-out hard fork, splitting big-block BTC from small-block BTC.  Risky of course, but there are [technical reasons to believe]( that *if* most miners were on board, they might just kill off the small-block chain.  Above all, I'm much less optimistic than you about the highly fragmented remainder of the community managing to converge on a defensive hard fork - say to change the mining algo.  Especially with many non-dev constituents already, rightly or wrongly, keen for bigger blocks.
    To be clear, I'd consider any of these a tragedy, since they'd amount to giving (most) devs the finger.  And of course there could be price mayhem etc.  But let's suppose you're a miner and you believe you were swindled in Hong Kong, the 1MB limit is costing you millions in future revenue, if you don't act Core won't increase it for years - and miners like ViaBTC do appear to believe these things.  Well, at some point drastic action is something you may consider.
5. Miners disrespected/ignored.  You've talked to many miners, I respect your view - what do you think *they* think?  Does Haiyang of feel like his interests play any role in Core's plans?  Does feel the Hong Kong agreement was upheld in good faith?  How about Huang Shiliang, who spoke at Chengdu, or the mysterious BW guys?  I'd love to read more frank interviews with miners, in China and elsewhere.  If they're content - so am I.
6. "Who is supposed to negotiate?"  This is the point I find frustrating.
    Sure, Bitcoin is based on personal autonomy.  And yet, coordination is needed, and happens.  Most conspicuously, Core has recognized leaders, like Greg and Adam and Pieter.  They've published explicit roadmaps, for crying out loud.  So when they go for a year or two without roadmapping changes miners and others have long been loudly pushing for (as I remember them doing in Montreal), that's not just an emergent property of an amorphous community.  That's a decision specific individuals are making - not as to what will happen, but as to what they're pushing for.
    So let Greg &amp; co say they're denying the miners' wishes because they don't think they're best for Bitcoin: I understand that.  But let's cut the crap about how there's no one to negotiate.  Greg and Adam could fly to Beijing and feel out what it would take to placate Haiyang &amp; co.  If it was something silly, like upping block rewards, they could reject it.  But if it was, say, a clear block size timeline, they could come back to the community and say here's a change which we think keeps things acceptably decentralized (remember: a year ago [Adam *proposed* 2-4-8]( and will keep our diverse community rowing as one.  Not dictating, but rallying support.  And I know for a fact that there are prominent Core devs that are ready for that, because I've talked to them.  All that's missing is an openness to reasonable compromise at the top.
    This is one way we could avoid all the hard fork, stalled-segwit nuclear showdowns.  Is there some other strategy here for activating segwit beyond "Wait for ViaBTC &amp; co to realize the error of their ways and accept what Core has given them" - or relaxing 95%?  If so please tell me, seriously - I've seen no sign of it, and I've been looking.
As always, a pleasure to get your informed and thoughtful take!

Force how?  He/they are working to find a solution that most of the community can live with.  People will then of course run whatever code they want.  Where's the force?
You don't think segwit advocates ever discuss strategy in small groups?  I have no problem if they do.
How a proposal brought to the community to be accepted or rejected can be seen as "force", but UASF as "not force", is beyond me.

So you're predicting that the NYA's 50+ signatory companies won't manage to deploy the Segwit2x code in time for the Sep/Oct-ish hard fork?
