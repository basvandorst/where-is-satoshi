This reminds of how developers generally behave in normal companies, they write something people can't use, or they don't want to adapt instead of trying to make it work for everybody without making them adapt just because some developer wanted.

Also, not everybody has this choice, believe me. Some people don't even care enough, people don't want to look for a segwit exchange, but actually fucking use bitcoin.

It's a different thing, from my view. Upgrading the blocksize isn't a "feature" such as segwit, but rather an attribute of the system.

That's exactly my point.
People want to use it.
People don't want to learn what segwit means.
It makes no fucking sense to need to know everything about a currency just to use it. I have no fucking idea of the processes they do to print the money as they do today, but I can use it. That argument is bullshit.

I don't think it will make a difference. Only when panic hits, bitcoin will have a chance to go higher.
While this Trump system is working, where they get more deficit and pump up debt, always a few months away of a recession, needing to print more money...  and there is no panic, nothing won't change.
But as soon as this hits hard the US(and the World), people will look into alternatives to safeguard their money, there is 2: bitcoin(with a lot of valuation potential) and metals.
And we are close.

BTC is a scam, BCC is the real coin, read the sub r/btc for the real story.
I'll get soon banned here and censored, like everyone else. Perhaps that message will reach you.
BCC = real bitcoin
BTC = BlocksTreamCOIN
