IIUC (didn't listen yet to the linked talk), cuckoo filters may replace the classic Bloom filters, those that support *lookup* and *insert* only, while for Bitcoin you need invertible Bloom filters that add the *list* and *retrieve* functionality.

To encrypt, use  
  
    gpg -c --cipher-algo AES256 seed.txt  
  
It will ask for a passphrase and will create an encrypted file seed.txt.gpg.  
  
To decrypt:  
  
    gpg seed.txt.gpg

* Wrong capitalisation "bitcoin" vs. "Bitcoin"  
* "You don't need to own/spend a full Bitcoin, they are divisible into bits (1/millionth of a Bitcoin)." - confusing answer, what about satoshies?  
* "Mining is kind of like a lottery where the more calculations you solve, the more lottery tickets you get. Every 10 minutes, a **random winner is chosen** and receives a chunk of bitcoins." - wrong phrasing 
  
Anyway, I liked the effort, tell your "friend" to continue work on it.

There is an idea of one-way process.  
  
There are situations when you can easily go from A to B, but it's practically impossible to go from B to A.  
  
For instance, a person may drop a glass and broke it, but it's practically impossible (although there is a tiniest theoretical probability) to drop a nandful of glass fragments so that they will stick back and form the original glass.
In mathematics, a person can (relatively fast) multiply two huge numbers by known algorithm, but there is no simple way to factor a huge number, since if the number is huge enough, it's practically impossible (e.g., will take millions of years) to check all the potential divisors.  
  
That's (oversimplified, but yet) the root of the public key cryptography the Bitcoin is based on.
