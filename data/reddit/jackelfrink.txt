Well. Not always.
The topic is too complex to get into here but this is only sometimes true. I know the VHS/BetaMax format wars is always pulled out as ~proof~ of this. But in the BlueRay/HD-DVD format war it was HD-DVD that went to porn first but BlueRay was the one that won the format war.
Radio and television should have been another. Just like the internet bringing porn into the privacy of the home, radio and television should have been a way for people to stop going to Burlesque shows and enjoy their erotica behind closed doors. But the content that made those popular was serialized episodic content.
The exact reason why some technology is driven by porn and some technology is not is way too complex to get into here. Just note that with bitcoin itself it was gambling websites like satoshidice that caused its growth rather than being driven by porn.
That porn.com is taking bitcoin should not be seen as some turning point where now it is going to become mainstream.

Ya know, I hardly come in this subreddit any more, but that comment sums up everything I have been feeling about bitcoin recently.
For a "community" that has its origins in revolution, anarcho captilism, and a constant drumbeat that banks deserve to fail if they cant keep up with changing technology, folks sure are quick to drop to the floor in a fetal position and start crying when it is THEIR stuff that is threatened with becoming obsolete.
Just like how the people who preach unreasonable hatred toward gays wind up being secretly gay themselves, the people who speak out loudest and strongest that everyone else fears change are the ones who fear change the most themselves.

If things were easy, everyone in the nation would be using them by this point.
The very first businesses that accepted credit cards when Diners Club rolled them out back in the 1950s probably faced a lot of technical challenges as well. The businesses that did were doing it not because it was easy, but because they had the vision to see what it would one day become.

If Im understanding the metaphor, then it is the person spending the bitcoins that has the largest bulk of responsibility. If they are they sort of person that is likely to spend bitcoins, they will probably already have selected one of the dozen or so ways they could do it and will have a system set up for themselves already.
In that case, the only thing I would need to do to accept bitcoins is to hang up a sign saying "Our business accepts bitcoins" and then when a customer walks up, I just agree to whatever style of transaction he has a preference for.

In my opinion, it makes more sense than other forms of alternative-currency.
I hear a lot of folks praising the gold standard. But honestly now, if civilization collapses what can you legitimately do with a bar of gold. Roving motorcycle gang breaks in you could hit them in the head I guess. But cake? People will always want cake!
And yes, I actually have had people bake me a cake, bring it in, and I swapped it for merchandise.

There are some advantages to negative interest bearing currencies. The [Miracle of Wörgl]( used just such a privately issued currency to boost the local economy and combat unemployment.
However, I don't think the idea would merge well with the bitcoin model. There is a built in upper limit to the number of bitcoins that can ever be mined. If the expiration date was set to "one year after the initial mining" what would happen one year after the last block is created?
I do believe demurrage can work as a currency system. I just thing think it can be "added on". It has to be something planed on from the start.
@_date: 2011-08-23 07:31:55


Im sorta new to BitCoin myself but I can try and put this into common terms.
Think of it in terms like WorldOfWarcraft gold or Linden Dollars in SecondLife. In once sense they dont have value as they are just strings of ones and zeros in a computer someplace. But in another sense they do have value because you can go to Ebay and swap them out for dollars or euros or yen or whatever you want.
But it is not the case that "people just agree" that world of warcraft gold has value. There was never this big gathering. "Here ye here ye. By order of the international WoW players association, we propose that in game gold have real world value. All in favor say aye." That never happened. Its worth value because people *want* it.
Likewise, bitcoins have value because people *want* them. Some because its a cause they believe in. Some because it gives them "nerd bragging rights" to say they use them. Some because they think the value will go up and if they just hold on to them they will be worth big big money in a few years. But in the end it does not matter why people want them. Heck, I still cant figure out why there are so many people that want old coca-cola advertising posters from the 30s and 40s. But as long as there are more people that want a thing than there are things in existence, that thing is going to have value.
As for what stops a hacker from just "making" bitcoins? Thats a bit harder to explain. But to use the WoW metaphor again, you cant just click on a field, type in a new number, and give yourself all the warcraft gold you want. Now a keen hacker might be able to crack into the main computers at BlizardSoftwartes home office. But for bitcoin there is no 'home office'. A hacker would need to break into the computers of every single user in the system simultaneously.
Please understand that there are graduate level computer science classes on the mathematics of public key encryption. So what Im about to say is grosly oversimplified. But it basically boils down to the mathematical operation of un-multiplying. For small numbers this is easy. 6 everyone knows is 2x3. But for larger numbers, like 463367, its a bit harder to figure out. A new bitcoin in generated every time someone is able to un-multiply a number on a predetermined list. So say one day that you discover that 463367 is 617x751. You would get the bitcoins for that and then everyone would start working on trying to un multiply the next number.
Could a hacker break the system? Probably not. If the goal number to un multiply was 147573952589676412927 and some hacker or con artist tried to claim "Hey guys! I un mutiplied it! Its 115563130952x127707391. That means I get the bitcoins! Gimmie!" it would take seconds for anyone with a calculator to know he was lying. Whoever finally does un multiply 147573952589676412927 will have his solution verified instantly.
Im not sure if any of this helps. If you have any more questions please dont hesitate to ask.

Oki, so he read the bill as original worded. Good work. He also read the updated bill after it was amended. Again, bravo for doing the research.
However, what he apparently missed is reading the original law that the bill is updating. From Louisiana state criminal code at  .....












So claiming this law bill "completely outlaws" the use of cash for secondhand goods is inaccurate. With this additional info, the statement by the state rep claiming this is purely an effort against the sale of stolen goods seems a lot more believable. Or at least more believable than the claim that this is a dastardly plot by an iron fistted police state to track our every movement.

We are going to see the biggest case of opinion-whiplash in internet history once folks catch on to the idea of [Transferable Virtual Property](
Say one of the major record labels wants to release a new MP3. Instead of releasing it to "the web" or to "the cloud" they release it to "the chain". There are only 10,000 copies. You want to listen to it you have to buy a key. Want to pirate or torrent the song? Tough. The same thing that stops bitcoins from being 'copied' or 'duplicated' means an end to the days of just coping a file to make another. Only 10,000 exist and thats it. You can exchange them among each other. But one copy of the Virtual Property per owner only.
The 'fuck big business' fanatics will try and find work around. They may agree to keep one copy of the song in a known address and then freely distribute that key. Now everyone has the key so everyone can have the song. Until they discover that someone moved the song out of the address and into their own private account.
The change from "the blockchain is a gift from the angles here to end capitalism once and for all" to "the blockchain is a tool of the devil here to give big business iron fistted control" is going to be amazing to watch.

I was addressing just the issue of volatility. I know I kind of skipped over the consumer protection part of your question. Sorry for giving a partial answer.
Anyway, any company providing consumer protection also has the power to cut you off. Im sure you are aware of the practice of PayPal freezing your account for any reason or for no reason. Heck, the first credit card processor I ever had froze my account out of the blue one day because I was selling [seat belt cutters]( and they claimed that it was an assault weapon and selling weapons was against my terms of service. So I was stuck having no way to process credit cards just 48 hours before I traveled from Pittsburgh to Denver for a trade show.

Well, me personally? I take bitcoin at my business imply because I don't want to be a hyprocyte. I often say 'diversity on all things' and if I only took one form of currency then I would not be living what I preach.
So in that regard at least I can find common ground with you. Bitcoin being the single lone one and only "monopoly" on the currency system is a horrible idea and I cant for the life of me figure out why the bitcoin-fanatics claim that putting all yoru eggs in one basket is a good thing.

Note that this issue spans several years and multiple situations. There is no way at all I can tl;dr it. I will summarize as best as I can, but I fully expect people to rationalize away what I say because some minor detail someplace got glossed over.
It starts in 1996 when Bill Clinton Signed the Communications Decency Act. Just a year later the Supreme Court struck down the anti-indecency provisions under [Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union](
Nothign happens for the next 8 years.
But then the NCSF gets a new board of directors. I will spare you all the gosip and personal interactions I have had with this guy but he does his snake-charming routine and manages to convince everyone else that George Bush is so evil that he travels backward through time to four years before he was elected to oppress our freedoms. On top of that, even though the anti-porn parts of the CDA got struck down already and it has caused totaly no legal issues for anyone for 8 years, he convinces everyone the CDA is still a grave and critical concern.
In steps the EFF. Now it is important to remember that Barbara Nitke did not take her case to the EFF. The EFF took their case to Barbara Nitke. Since as I said, the anti-porn measures of the CDA had already been struck down and the parts not struck down had caused no problems for 8 years, there wasn't any court case the EFF could fight for. They had to manufacture a crisis out of nothing. They posted a job-listing asking if anyone would be willing to be the test case and Nitke answered. They filed a lawsuit claiming the CDA *could* get used against Barbara Nitke. Ta da! Now thers a court case.
The legal battle went something like this. Supreme Court: What is your grounds for the lawsuit? EFF: Bush is Hitler! Supreme Court: Er? Ok, but what makes you think this dead and gone issue is going to come back? EFF: No! You dont understand. Bush is LITERALLY Hitler! Supreme Court: Er, ok. Ya know what. I think we will pass on hearing this one.
By the way, the same week as the lawsuit was dismissed as groundless, the Supreme Court *did* hear the Anna Nicole Smiths estate case. That alone should tell you the size of the molehill that the EFF was trying to change into a mountain.
Also important to note that Nitkes website is still [up and functional]( You can view sexual explicit material without so much as having a 'click here if you are over 18' button to push. If it honestly was true that puritanical jack booted thugs are just itching to use the CDA to haul off all sinful perverts to jail, they sure are taking their sweet time to use the law against Nitke. The parts of the CDA that were not struck down in Reno-V-ACLU are still in place and it have been over 14 years now.
Now again, I will not go so far as saying the EFF lied to the public in an effort to keep people scared. Its a known tactic that keeping people scared and then claiming the only salvation is to give me money is a well known fear-mongering tactic. But that isnt quite what the EFF is up to. Chicken Little was not a liar either. Chicken Little honestly actually did believe the sky was falling.
Actually its not chicken little. Its the boy who cried wolf.
Its strange. Looking through various post histories of other commentators here I saw one person saying they want open source software because they want to know what they are being handed is what the autor claims it is. Yet when the piece of writing is changed to a press release instead of software, we are all too eager to just buy what they are peddling hook line and sinker.
And now, let the 'Your wrong! The EFF would never exaggerate claims to make the danger they are fighting against seem worse than what it actually is' rationalizations and justifications begin ..... I will be awaiting everyone's posts.

There are more than enough speculators around who think bitcoin is a magic box where you put in one dollar and two dollars come out. They wold be fine with bitcoin as a whole going down the tubes as long as they personally got rich. They would jump at the chance and it would create a hard fork. Within a month there would be as many forks of bitcoin as there are altcoins. In the chaos no business would know what coins they should or should not be taking and the very notion of 'used as currency' comes apart.

Im a merchant who has been accepting alternative payment methods since before Satoshi's whitepaper was even published. I do over a dozen methods now including silver, Canada Tire, and cake.
If I could draw what may be a strange analogy, think of the film Toy Story. A toy that a child does not play with is a sad and tragic thing. But that was exactly what Beanie Babies were. There was a secondary market of plastic storage devices to keep them in pristine condition and NOT be played with. Instead of *being* a toy, they were hoarded as a get rick quick scheme by people wanting to make tons of money for no work.
Now I feel the same way with Bitcoin. The top question you see in the forums is asking how to set up a paper wallet. In other words, the bulk of the Bitcoin community is interested in how to properly set up a system that will guarente the Bitcoins will be sitting there pristine and untouched for years uppon years.
A currency that nobody uses to exchange goods and services must be a lonely and heartbreaking existence. I would not want to be a bitcoin right now.
Please engage in commerce. Your bitcoins WANT to live their life as a currency. Locking them away keeps them from their destiny.

A bit of clarification on my part. I had not met to imply that someone memorize a bunch of 4-digit *numbers*. I had met to imply that someone memorize a bunch of 4-*character* chunks. So you don't need to memorize 20 of them. You just need to memorize 12¾ of them.
Memorizing 20 random dictionary words may very well be simpler. Im just making the point that memorizing a private key directly is not some impossible task that only a super genius could ever accomplish.

From what I understand, people HAD money, but were keeping it stuffed in mattresses and so forth because they thought things were going to get worse and that they would need that money for later. Then as a sell fulfilling prophecy, since nobody was spending the economy was sluggish and things *did* get worse.
Thats why during the great depression there were so many experiments into negative interest bearing currencies. It was an insensitive to spend rather than hoard. Greases the wheels of the economy and gets things moving again.

Im not really talking inflationary. I just want SOME mechanism in place where exchanging goods and services is encouraged and "stuffing it in a mattress" and not touching it for years at a strech is punished. With the system as it is now, the revers is true. The guy who spend 500 coin back in April to buy a television is kicking himself for how stupid he was. The guy who DIDNT spend 500 coin back in April but rather put it into a paper wallet and didn't touch it is patting himself on the back about his wise choice.
A currency that discourages its use as currency is no currency.

Im not sure if you are old enough to remember the dot-com bubble, but the same thing happened. People would buy a stock knowing nothing about what the company did (and some times the only thing the company DID was sell their stock.) They put in $100 and three days later they are a millionaire.
The entire thing did eventually come crashing down. But that did not mean an end to the internet or eCommerce as a whole. But WHILE the bubble was going on? At the time it was an uphill battel trying to get anything actualy productive accomplished. It was just speculation speculation speculation.
Im a merchant. I have been accepting alternative currency at my business since around 2006. Before bitcoin was even thought up. I take everything from Canada Tire to Silver to Cake. Personally, I cant wait for all the "ZOMG!

Negative interest bearing rather than deflationary.
In my dream fantasy world, this would be done with non-transaction fees rather than transaction fees. If you hoard rather than spend, then after one month of inactivity a 0.001% fee is taken from your account and given the people running network nodes.
As it stands right now, the smart move is to hoard and the dumb move is to use bitcoin to trade for goods and services. (Someone paid 10 thousand coin for a pizza? What a noob! If they had just waited they would have been rich by now!) But with non-transaction fees people would be encouraged to go to a business and spend before their one month grace period is over and they start getting charged fees.
I have no idea how this would be implemented. People could easily sidestep it by transferring coin to themselves and thus resetting the grace period. Maybe a stamp-currency system instead of non-transaction feels. I dont know. I cant claim how it would be written in computer code. Im just giving my wish-list.

This is sort of odd but this is one of my areas of expertise. Last year I taught a three day intensive workshop in North Carolina and my keynote address for the weekend was "does porn drive technology: What the penny farthing bicycle can tell us about the future of digital media."
I know everyone pulls out the VHS -v- BetaMax thing as an example that whatever technology embraces porn will succeed. However, this is only true in SOME cases not in all. One easy example is YouTube. This should have been perfect for porn but Youtube came first and the porn websites tried to catch up to it. Coppying even the name (YouPorn. RedTube.)
Another example is radio. People going out in public to a Burlesque show where they may be seen was shameful. Having the signal come directly into the privacy of your own home and behind closed doors should have mimicked the grown of the internet where people stopped going to video parlors and could view porn behind closed doors. But radio became popular without the aid or porn. (And it wasn't due to regulation. The hayse code didnt come to be until decades after radio.)
And just to be complete, Im not saying porn rarely/never drives technology. The Leyden jar, for example, was originally a sex toy.
What factors cause a new technology to be driven by porn and what factors cause it to be driven by other things beside porn is a vastly complex topic. (My keynote address was 2 hours. Im not going to type it all in.) But in my somewhat informed opinion, gambling websites like SatoshiDice are a much bigger deal. If we weant to go hunting big fish we should go after GoldenPalace and not after Brazzers.

Not to get too bogged down, but this is only sometimes true. Blu-ray vs HD DVD is one example. Youtube came first and was hugely popular and the porn websites all try and mimic it rather than RedTube / YouPorn being hugely popular first and YouTube trying to mimic then.
To actually get into why porn sometimes drives technology and sometimes porn does not drive technology is beyond the scope of this subreddit. I would have to go all the way back to the history of the Leiden jar to give a full explanation and I dont feel like typing it all out.
So yeah. Bitcoin became popular and places like ebay and paypal started looking into it and THEN it got picked up by porn. Not the other way around.

More than you think. The 'stone man loss' I refereed to from before was [this guy]( posting back in 2010. He tried backing up his wallet, sending one coin, then deleting everything and restoring the backup. Because he believed the backup had that spent coin 'in' the wallet. He thought that once he restored the backup he would be back to his original balance that the wallet had at the time of the backup.
Naturally the change address wasn't generated until after the backup. And when he restored, the backup he restored from did not have the change address. He lost almost nine thousand bitcoins.
A lot of people assume a wallet IS the bitcoin.

Oh I will. I will. I have been accepting alternative currency since 2006. Thats 2 years before Satoshis white paper. Currently I accept over a dozen different payment methods.
People keep saying the volatility is the biggest problem for merchants because they cant advertise or publish a price. And while this is an issue (I would love to have a customer pick up something from the vendor booth shelf, ask me "how much is this" and I say "Thats ten mBits") it is not nearly as big an issue as people hoarding coins rather than spending them.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:43:48
Um? Not quite sure if I agree.
Im a merchant and I take not only bitcoin but also WebMoney, CanadaTire, silver, cake, and over a dozen other different payment methods.
Volatility is not nearly as important as acceptability. During a natural disaster like a hurricane or earthquake, cash becomes next to useless and people instead use bottled water or gas as their "currency" to exchange goods. This does not mean the dollar is volatile. It means the number of people wanting bottled water is higher than the number of people wanting dollars.
Likewise, if I could take from my old days playing DiabloII, a SoJ was the default currency despite it being quite volatile. That was because everyone needed one. Even if you were not playing a sorceress you still needed a SoJ. All players traded and exchanged in terms of SoJs even though the exchange rate for SoJs changed nearly by the hour.
Even though I take bitcoin, the biggest hurdle for me is NOT that I have to re-adjust my prices all the time. The biggest hurdle is that customers would rather hoard than spend.

As I said above, alternate currencies have been a kind of hobby of mine and this was the exact idea behind stamp currencies during the great depression in america.
People had money stuffed into their mattress. Saving it away for later. This stagnated economic flow. Economy gets worse. Even more people start to hoard away their cash instead of spending it. Less people spending meant more stagnation. Etc. Etc. So places started experimenting with stamp currencies and the places it was tried experienced economic growth.
So depending on how you define 'worthless' I may or may not agree with you. If you mean 'of no value' then no. But if you mean 'so valuable it becomes impractical' then yes.

Ok, so aluminium used to be a precious metal more valuable than gold. Until the discovery of electricity that is, and a method of using electricity to precipitate it out. Now aluminium is so cheep we throw it away when we get done using it.
But in contrast, diamonds used to be extra hard to get so that is what gave them their value as well. But once we discovered technology to create diamonds by the truckload, diamonds did not suddenly become worthless.
If or when a way is discovered to filter ocean water for gold particles, we could be churning out hundreds of tons of the stuff a day. But when that day comes, will it be like aluminium and become worthless? Or be like diamonds and stay the same?

Bitcoin as it stands right now is a playground for day traders. Not a currency. I am a merchant myself and I know it sucks but thats just how things are right now.
Dont give up on it. After all, during the height of the dot-com bubble in the 90s, doing commerce on the internet was dang near impossible in the wake of all the startups who were having their stocks double overnight and everyone treating dot-com-starts like some magic money machine. But now? Now commerce on the web is standard.

Seems as if every subculture believes that their personal wish list is the *real* point behind bitcoin.
Capitalists believe bitcoin was intended to be the first true open market and will finally put an end to socialism. Socialists believe bitcoin was invented to 'bring down the system' and finally put an end to capitalism. Privacy advocates believe that Bitcoin was invented to hide all monetary information. Transparency advocates believe that Bitcoin was invented to make all monetary transactions open and able to be viewed by anyone. Day traders believe that Bitcoin is the commodity that is impossible to go down. Neoanarchists believe that Bitcoin will eliminate the very idea of richness and make all people globally have exactly the same amount of money.
Heck, Im waiting for the environmentalists to jump on board and say that the reason bitcoin was invented was to stop the use of fossil fuels. Or the feminists to say that Bitcoin was actually invented to cause equal pay for equal work.
Only one who actually knows the real reason behind its invention is Satoshi and he aint talking.

Um? Ok, you realize you ARE on reddit? Right?

Well crap. I read that wrong then :(
Is there anyone in this subreddit who even *wants* to use bitcoins as currency?
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:39:59


If you are Swiss it probably does.
Consider the following. Back in my days of playing DiabloII, if I wanted a Paladin Combat Charm I knew I would need to trade 3 runestones for it. A perfect Heart of the Oak might cost me 8 or 9 runestones. Never once did I think to myself "Ok, so a Skin of the Vipermagi costs $24 dollars on eBay and runestones are going for $8-$10, so Im will need to get 2½-3 runestones." I always 'skipped the middle man' and thought directly in the in game currency without needing to convert to dollars.
So just saying "Guess how you measure the value of anything? By pricing it in terms of something else" I think misses the point. In game Items in DiabloII were measured in dollars. But I never THOUGHT of them as being measured in dollars.
Its the difrence between "I will do an internet search for it on google" on the one hand and "I will google it" on the other.
Now I can easily imagine the day comming (and comming soon) where I will go to my local bitcoin users meetup, order a cheeseburger, and think inside my own head "Ok, thats 90 mBit for the cheeseburger". But as it stands right now, what happens inside my own head is "Ok, thats $12 for the cheeseburger. So thats around 90 mBit".

If thats what you believe actually happened, you are an example of kind of the problem Im talking about.
And as far as who *I* am? I own and run my own business selling BDSM bondage equipment. So I was actually kind of on the 'front lines' when it all went down. (Though I only met Barbara Nitke once and Im sure she wouldn't remember me.) The actually problem I have is that the EFF grossly misrepresented the goings on in the case to the point where it bordered on flat out lies.
But again, other people can do what they want. If you want to believe that the only way someone could ever ever be disillusioned by the case is because they are some kind of bible thumpin jesus freak, then go ahead and slap the label of 'victorian minded prude' onto me. I wont stop you.

While he is there might as well look up "ever" as well. After heat death of the universe (around a hundred trillion years from now) I am absolutely positive that the value of a bitcoin will be zero.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:21:11
Well the only way that would happen is if there was a major security flaw discovered, or a doublespend for several million dollars got through, or MrGox turns out to be another BS&amp;T. And if thats the case it will go to zero by the end of two weeks.
What I would do is remind people that alternative currencies in general still exist and hype the dozen or so non-cryptocurrencies that my business accepts.

You think there is mania now? Wait until there is an entire CHANNEL for bitcoin.

Will you cut that out? How are we suppose to have a 'we live in an iron fisted police state' panic attack if you keep doing stuff like that?

Yep. As I said elsewhere, [Transferable Virtual Property]( is sure to happen. Instead of a video game being released on "The Web" it will be released on "The Chain". No DRM needed as each game can only have one owner. No more torenting and pirating with rationalizations of "Im not steeling, its just making a copy."
One small saving grace is that someone who owns a video game can legitimately transfer ownership to a new address at will. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:00:41
I think you misunderstood my point. Im not claiming that bitcoin will never tank. Im claiming it will tank in 2017. And between now and then we will see people murdered for their bitcoin, see people taking out 3 mortgages and putting all of it into bitcoin, see bitcoinhats.com get 5 billion in venture capital when the total sales of hats in the nation is only 2 billion a year.
A few CNN reports and mining gear selling for $50 on ebay is no where near being "mania". The big roller coaster ride is yet to come.

Well, agreed on the condition that people want to use bitcoin for exchanging goods and services. The default metaphor is that if a customer cant buy anything besides alpaca socks then its not any use as a currency. (Likewise, I am a merchant and if there is no customers willing to pay me in bitcoin then me hanging up a sign saying 'bitcoin accepted here' is as worthless as me hanging up a sign saying 'Marklar marklar marklar'.)
But where this falls apart is assuming people WANT to use bitcoin to exchange goods and services. And at least here on r/Bitcoin that is a very rare thing. I have witnessed the idea being actively ridiculed. "What? Someone paid 10,000 coin for a pizza? What an idiot! I cant believe someone would have been that stupid. He would have been a millionaire by now if he had just held on to it."
Day traders? Yep, we got plenty of them here. And they do not need a large user base for what they do. Radical Libertarians who believe bitcoin will 'bring down the system'. We got plenty of those as well. And they dont need a large user base in order to go around proselytizing. The only people who need a large user base are the merchants and they are few and far between.
So for most of the folks here? No. No you do not need two people to make a transaction. For most folks here, operating in a vacuum does not diminish the value of bitcoin at all.

Are you honestly actually trying to claim that Ripple is NOT peer-to-peer decentralized?
~sigh~ Ya know what? Never mind. You are right. Bitcoin is a unique precious snowflake and nothing ever ever ever came remotely close in all of history. Satoshi came up with it totally and completely out of the blue. He didn't build on previous attempts at decentralized digital currencies that failed. It was a completely unique never before seen entity with absolutely no failed predecessors.
Im gonna go make soup now .....

When I did an AMA last year someone asked just that. I answered it [here](
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:54:48
Or, ya know, exchange goods and services in receipt of bitcoin.
There is something just slightly depressing in the idea that people using bitcoin *as* currency are now considered 1%

Back in the dawn of history if I had a bundle of wheat and wanted a sheep, I had to go find someone who had a cord of wood, I would trade my wheat for his wood, then I take the wood back to the original guy and trade it for his sheep. This system, though frustrating, was possible. But when currency was invited I could just trade my currency directly for the sheep I wanted. Currency was progress.
Now in modern times if I had a currency and wanted a sheep, I had to go find someone who had a cord of wood, I would trade my currency for his wood, then I take the wood back to the original guy and trade it for his sheep. This system, though frustrating, was possible. The claim now is that direct trade of goods without a middle man is no longer needed. Multi-step bartering is progress.
If you honestly fail to see thew difference between "take my money to a local furniture store" on the one hand and "take my money to a bank, take my bank info to Mr Grox, take my Mt Grox to Gyft, take my Gyft to Amazon, take my Amazon and get my computer chair" on the other hand then you are going to be in for quite a shock in about 3 years when bitcoin actually does become currency.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:00:03
Meh. Im used to it. You should see the downvotes I get when I say I cant even buy a hooker with bitcoin.
Currency it may one day be. But it is not currency NOW.

If I JUST got done saying that what I teach in the workshop was that porn wasn't responsible for the *mainstreaming* of TGPs, why are you still thinking that what I teach int the workshop is that porn wasn't responsible for the *invention* of TGPs. Are you really more of an expert of what I am or am not teaching in the workshop than I am myself?
The saying goes that there are three ways of arguing. Arguing to be right, arguing to be understood, and arguing to be entertained. I think at this point I should take my cue from [xkcd]( and not get myself so emotionally involved in this one. You can believe anything you want to about what I do or do not teach in the workshop. I should go to bed instead of staying here and arguing.
