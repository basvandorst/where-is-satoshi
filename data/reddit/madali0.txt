You guys need to understand that sometimes spending money today can be more fulfilling that spending it in a decade.

You are.

So, let me get this straight, you wouldn't recommend Genesis trading?

He was manipulating the market using illegal means (bribery, using the blackmarket, etc). Usually people like these get away but because Iran is under so much outside pressure to force a regime change, this time, the government had to take it very seriously 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:34:49
Free rein.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:57:22
I've explained already in other parts of this thread. He wasn't just saving his assets, he was manipulating the market by illegally trading gold coins in the black market to the tune of 250,000 good coins (2 tons of gold).
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:14:58
I live in Iran. The economic situation and the currency devaluation affects my life directly and it sucks humongous balls having your assets and purchasing power get devalued by 80% in less than a year. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:41:03
BBC isn't being honest. It wasn't for hording gold. It was for manipulating the market by bribery, using an illegal network, and being involved in blackmarket trading.
Generally public are happy with this move.

No, he didn't try to escape the collapse. He illegally manipulated the market by trading 2 tons of gold in the black market. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:56:19
Great retort. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:53:32
How did they annilate the currency? Who signed a deal with Iran and then cancelled the deal once Iran fulfilled their part of the terms? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:07:20
He alone didn't cause the devaluation, but he contributed to it during an extremely sensitive economical time by buying and selling gold in the black market. I like to remind you, the issue isnt that he just BOUGHT gold. The state doesn't discourage that. The issue was he had a huge amount of gold, distributed over an underground network, to constantly buy and sell, which the only purpose of raising the prices. 
Multiple people were arrested over this conspiracy.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:29:35
The headline is misleading, I didn't waste time reading the link. The guy who was executed was nicknamed "The Sultan of Goldcoins". He was using an illegal network of people to manipulate the market. This caused a disruption in the market and during sensitive economic times in Iran due to Trump's pressure on Iran, caused furthur pressure on the currency. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:04:09
This happened during a situation where the local currency was under a lot of pressure due to the actions of the US administration, who attempted to pressure the Iranian state by pulling out of the JCPOA.
During this time, the state was trying to control the currency by various means. In this very sensitive ecobomic situation, you had someone like this guy who would use an underground network to buy and sell these gold coins. This was the amount of gold coins in his possession, but of course he probably sold and bought more than this amount.
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:19:35
I've tried to explain several times how his actions were extremely damaging and illegal.
Let me try to explain this another way. Iran's situation is not elsewhere. In anywhere in the world would buying and selling large amounts gold would be illegal, if for no other reason than tax, money laundering, etc. 
However, for Iran's situation, it's even much more serious that issues of those, because we are more or less in a war situation. Let's just use an example that might be slightly similiar in spirit m Imagine your country being at war and the enemy destroys all your morphine factoried and now you have low supply of morphine, which is increasing the prices of it.
While the state is trying to control the prices of morphine, we find out a person is using an illegal network of people to horde morphine and trade then in a way to increase the price of it. 
Does that make more sense?
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:02:47
That's sort of what he did. Most of the Iranian population are able to buy and sell a few gold coins. One gold coin costs around 2 or 3 times an average Iranian salary. This guy was using an underground network to buy and sell 250,000 gold coins. This was unprecedented. 
Keep in mind that raising gold coin prices by manipulation makes the person a large amount of money (10s of millions of dollars) but it reduces the value of the Iranian Rial, meaning he contributed to reducing the buying power of 80 million people. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:58:58
He wasn't manipulating international gold prices, he was manipulating the price of gold relative to the Iranian Rial. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:04:18
Trading gold in Iran is very popular and it is not discouraged or made illegal. The government issues gold coins. It's so popular that a lot of companies, when they are offering prizes, it's in gold coins.
This was however for moving very large amount of gold using an underground network and a large mafia web. It is claimed that he moved around 250,000 gold coins illegally or the equivalent of 2 tons of gold.

Three seperate sentences and all of them are wrong. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:41:52
Personally, I think Bitcoin turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. The world powers are too powerful. I think it has potential, but think about how most of you trade in bitcoin. Most likely you use some sort of banking initially. What would you do if you don't have access to credit cards (since all major credit cards are American and USA banned them for Iranians?).
I guess you could use Localbitcoin but they are obviously not as easy as using places like Coinbase, which is not an option for Iranians. Without such an option available, inexperienced non-techies will have a hard time.
Finally, the fact that is not stable makes it unappealing. Imagine encouraging your grandfather to trust in Bitcoin instead of traditional methods and they convert rial to Bitcoin at 10,000 and it drops to 6,000. The traditional methods are foreign Fiat (USD, EUR), Property, and/gold. Personally, I converted a big portion of my savings into land.
Also, keep in mind that people generally convert their money when they are already losing their currency's value. So, imagine a person losing 80% of their value, converting it to Bitcoin in panic, and then losing another 50%. 
In Iran, generally the safest route is gold coins. You can buy them legally, store them in a bank, which even gives you some interest.
Edit: I dream of a future where cryptocurrency is stable and accessible. I recently registered for Amazon Music for my Amazon Echo. This is how I had to do it. First buy a VPN, then register a fake US address on Amazon, then purchase a prepaid debit visa card from an Iranian company at a premium (who buys them from a different country using fake accounts), then use that just to be able to pay a monthly fee for Amazon Music. What if I could do it easily with crypto? I wouldn't want it to make me rich, I'd be happy just to have something to buy services online.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:57:31
No, you don't know what you are talking about. The government didn't discourage gold trade. The government itself sold gold to the people. The government doesn't mind people using gold. There is a difference between buying gold legally and trying to manipulate the market by causing a crash using 250,000 gold coins (or 2 tons of gold).
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:39:05
He was executed for buying gold during currency collapse. He was executed for CONTRIBUTING TO the currency collapse. He was manipulating the market using illegal means 
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:57:30
Shame that people can't debate and resort to the typical talking points from their government's PR office.
Whatever, man. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:35:56
He was contributing to the currency collapse. He was imprisoned few times and was given warnings, but just went back to his manipulations because apparently he felt he had the government in his pocket. Initially, the Central Bank chief even defended him.
But the central bank chief was forced to resign, several deputies of Central Bank was jailed, and then one of the biggest economy mafia kingpins was charged. 
Any other time, he probably would have gotten away with bribering everyone. But the economical situation in Iran is so sensitive now that they can't afford allowing manipulators like that free reign.

I'm in Iran, you don't know what you are talking about. 
The house market isn't going down. House market goes up in times of currency devaluation, since property becomes a more stable market. Housing has increase by 200% to 300% in 6 months
Second is gold. There are several denominations of gold. 
People also buy foreign currency such as USD &amp; EURO.
Finally, the stock market is down this week, but it had a good month. We hit a historical record last week.

I love it when people tip in this sub. If 100 people tipped the same amount, the guy would have 0.3 US dollars.
