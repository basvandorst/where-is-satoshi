Funny How Paypal (and eBay) are continuing to do this. And for newcomers like myself who have lost a few bitcoins to the people that take paypals buyer protection to the full. The amount of excuses people have used to me after paying through Paypal, communicating quite okay via email correspondance, until the bitcoin is sent then.. Bang!!! Paypal dispute.
I have since turned to mining and market to recoup my bitcoins. Including some wild places like bitcoinpyramid.comand coinurl
Hopefully, slowly I will recoup what I had lost :/

That is an ignorant article written by someone who obviously gets their bitcoin knowledge from a few words that are thrown around. How about some real non-Fox attitude related journalosm :D

I started out buying from VirWox using the link 
Can do CC and Paypal, although they do limit you for the first 10 days of the account.
Probably a little bit more expensive than some though.

Sorry, in addition to my previous comment. You will have to trade your US or EU for SLL, and then trade the SLL for BTC

Agree with HorseToeNail. And we're about to see a drop in the price of bitcoin soon. It will not be stable over $1,000. But it will be the next rise after this bubnle burst will go past $1,000.

So many great things happen because people are bored or have too much time. :)
That's an awesome job :)
