trezor is vulnerable to the extraktor attack (as shown by ledger's security team). Ledger is not vulnerable to this exploit due to its secure element.

This is kind of true. But after people constantly pointed out shitpay and their dislike for it, you guys should have tried to switch to at least something else (doesnt have to be btcpay)
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:08:29
I'm pretty sure they did

Ledger has secure element (and a cheaper price). Trezor has an unfixable vulnerability (according to ledger devs, who I believe have uploaded a video somewhere.)
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:57:36
hey guys nitcoin here
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:38:16
contact coinbase support
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:05:00
Circumvention is not a fix. Also you spelled coward wrong. Also ledger has no currently functioning exploits that have as bad an impact as the trezor extraktor exploit. So continue on ur epic shitpost spree
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:33:14
stop being a fucking idiot how about that

@_date: 2019-09-22 00:39:42
what the hell is this shitpost?
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:33:34
 this, useless to mine on phone
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:44:24
such as? you literally showed 0 proof
@_date: 2019-09-13 10:44:53
yep, scam
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:03:04
this, an influx of shit happening like this but no lawyer. very sus
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:01:21
0$ because I know there is nothing
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:20:57
how about 10 BTC per currently existing vulnerability?
@_date: 2019-09-08 00:01:55
I will admit ledger devs are lazy as fuck, but they have no currently working exploits on the ledger
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:31:44
What kind of dumb shitpost is this? my original comment was about a vulnerability trezor currently has - so you lost?
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:48:46
dumb as fuck shitpost
@_date: 2019-09-08 16:55:56
once again 0$ cuz u have nothing
@_date: 2019-09-30 00:22:03
amount and fee is basically enough
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:53:49
try other sites then (gemini, cashapp, binance maybe)
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:34:41
just write a tldr, can't be bothered to read this
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:28:17
yeah i bet
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:34:21
No. you may not. I asked you for proof of any of these exploits and you had nothing. Also circumvention as a fix: "for the newest windows exploit, instead of patching it, just turn ur computer off so u cant be hacked!"
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:19:10
is ur brain fully functioning?
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:31:24
My take on this:
Tell them to make a coinbase account, age it (get to level3 so they can put large amounts), then sell the property, once it gets to their bank, convert to btc (then either send btc to urself, or ask them for the account)
@_date: 2019-09-08 14:23:47
once again, link them
you have 0 proof
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:36:04
this, they delay it every week ROFL
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:41:59
LMFAO this is plausible
