"New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin"
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:11:35
What would the scammers do with that info?

Why the botnet owner mined BTC? LTC would have been way more profitable!

I think Mark buys only legal things With BTC.

I guess internet hasn't been on for a good time.

I can admit that i have a small gambling problem. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:06:24
Well i wouldn't be able to gamble if there wasn't bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:45:39
What doesn't make sense? 
Im just saying that with all the good things bitcoin can give to me, it also made me start gambling. 
I may get a small amount later this month, but ill think twice about it.

Well, for a while, it was the only big thing with Bitcoin.

Google pays me $270/hour!
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:46:06
Also, i am not on anyones side, not saying that it is crashing, not saying that it is going up!

Transaction has a confirmation, not showing up for a good time. :(

If you mined with your computer, then you had to pay for the electrocity way more than what you earned. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:54:30
Oh well, no need for me to worry about that. :(
Just lost all my coins gambling  
Good game, well played. 
P.s - i hate myself. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:15:42
Well i understand that. But somehow the fact that the coins are virtual and i can't touch them makes me think they are worthless. I understand the price of them and so on, but somehow shit happens. Ill try to not touch gambling when i get some coins next time. I have lost like 2BTC there. :(

DOGECOIN GOES TO THE MOON!

Im not too much into all the selling/buying. I use them to buy stuff, not trade them over and over again. Just sometimes, i wish i would have bought shit later. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:11:58
PayPal doing something good? Haha, sure...
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:13:02
And 2nd confirmation, still nothing has been added to my acc. Should i be worried? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:28:15
Enjoy that you are a meal!
