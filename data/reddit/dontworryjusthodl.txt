“As a Bitcoin maximalist” “ETH will outperform BTC” ok guy

Not quite. There's no Coinbase fee when withdrawing your BTC from either Coinbase itself or GDAX. What you can do is deposit fiat into Coinbase for free, move it to GDAX for free, and then trade it for BTC without paying the couple of dollars to Coinbase that you'd get hit with if you buy BTC directly in Coinbase.

It was either Reddit or Slashdot the summer of 2011. I remember that summer like it was yesterday, chilling in a literal outdoor shed with a computer for storm water research. Tried figuring out Mt. Gox, tried getting a Dwolla account going. Was a broke college student. Couldn't buy any until Coinbase in early 2013.

This is how I think about everyday purchases now. Do I really want to spend $40 on that latte? Forget about it.

I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2013. This year my education on the technicals has taken an exponential curve, but yet I still can't find any clear information about the Empty Block phenomenon. Is it not easier and faster for a miner to get the rewards off perfectly legal empty blocks? They would save the whole process of finding transactions and bundling them into blocks. Are the fees really enough of an incentive when they represent say &lt;1% of the value of mining an empty block?

Interesting. In your view what was the "point" of the graphic novel that was missed in the movie? Also how would you describe the original intent of anonymous?

I hope they legalize breathing soon. I hate operating in such a gray zone without a proper regulatory framework in place.

When is the class action lawsuit coming? When are we going to demand that centralized third parties are not allowed to store our sensitive information?

Not sure about country restrictions but if you link your bank account your limits go way up.

The core devs should focus on the technical implementation of Bitcoin and not speculate on fuzzy and politically charged discussions. 
Big names in the space DO talk about the macroeconomic implications of Bitcoin. Max Kaiser and Jeff Berwick come to mind.

Don't worry, just HODL!

Elon Musk is a false hero. He's a puppet of the elite and helps spread their giant lies.
