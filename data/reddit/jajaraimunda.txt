Bitcoin will never become a generally used currency. I mean, 4-5 transactions per second lol that is nothing compared to what visa does. Plus the cornerstone of a currency is that it holds its value: bitcoin doesn't

You love gambling thats why you love bitcoin

When you gamble you don't know if you have and edge over your competition: meaning that you don't know if you have a positive expectancy using your strategy over the long run (and most people don't even have a strategy when investing)

"Some effort is required to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances. This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your privacy."

Sure it's not automatically anonymous, but most people will still be anonymous. Bitcoin even encourages you to not reveal your identity: "This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once."

You don't need inside information to be profitable in the stock market. I really recommend reading William O Neil- he may seriously turn you into a millionaire (but you have to work hard AF for it)

Sure, that's true if you invest to follow an indice. Otherwise it's just not. Nothing is, certain in the stock market. Remember that :)

Crypto currencies are in practice just for criminals and gamblers. 95% of them will eventually go to zero

Then you're a gambler. Do you know what the dark net is? Bitcoin is the currency of the dark net because you can't track who pays who

If you don't know how to invest then yes, you will have crappy returns lol... Pls inform yourself before speaking :)

No the company doesn't necessarily need an edge for you to have an edge (but it's preferred). The market is driven by emotions and earnings. If you can read those two correctly you might make money

No, it doesn't not with bitcoin

I'm sorry for sounding condescending. What I'm trying to say is that most people just gamble in bitcoin- sure the technology behind it is cool but now it just seems like a bubble ready to get bust. Bitcoin is also very risky since you cant use a stoploss and therefor have to track the price 24/7. If you invest carefully in growth stocks you can achieve outstanding results with calculated risk. I'm sorry for sounding like an asshole in the first comment I guess I'm just mad at people trying to justify their gambling habits... (I'm not saying that you are a gambler thou because I have no clue what strategy you use) Cheers from Sweden :)

Stocks are boring because you're lazy and have an innate need for thrill and gambling
