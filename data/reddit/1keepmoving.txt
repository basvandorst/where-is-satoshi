Goat?! Man I havn't heard of him since he deleted all his posts from bct a couple years back. Interestingly, it was his final post telling everyone to hodl that made me decide to sell.

Most miners just pay for expenses and hold their btc. Many plan to hold for years...

You can have an intrinsic value of $220, and still pay $110.

Maybe you need to find a partner and upgrade to a full hand?

Actually I'm referring to [intrinsic value]( and [market value](

Serious question. Do we even have proof Dorian Nakamoto has a brother?

Only if you thought the $20 dollar bill would be worth more then $50 in the future =) or if you just really want to enjoy the experience, sure.

If I want to make a deposit into my bank after hours, I can not. If I want to withdraw more then $500 from an atm after banking hours I can not. With bitcoin I can transfer value without the need for a third party to be open.

So would have have told the Founding Fathers, MLK, or Ghandi the same thing? [Civil Disobedience](

Miss leading title much? The Central bank of Vietnam is not doing business with Bitcoin institutions. That is far from transactions being banned.

If all these other people in the foundation what makes Gavin clean? I'm trying to find information about his new position but I can't find more then it being flaunted as a title.

Do a search for BTC mining calculator.

Performing a double spend attack, even if you did pull one off, would have serious consequences on the miner that perpetrated the attack.

No one knows. But it should't be an issue once LN is out.

Care to elaborate on what parts of the ToS are an issue for you?

This is the most important part of the article IMO:

I think they meant Stability of Value. Also, overall this is not a negative review and rather optimistic. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:39:15
You must be new here? Before using something, I would recommend you try reading up on things and how they work. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:15:15
Your article is good. Your title is too suggestive. You must not be very business savvy if you thought that the current banks would just roll over and allow their competition (Bitcoin) to take off without a hitch. It would be like asking Coke to help bottle Pepsi drinks better. 
Edit: Also, I think its quite amusing that your trying to open a BTC business without even having spent Bitcoin yet.

Water, firemen, education, social security, welfare. 
Someone needs to do more research.

It's my right to be as "suspicious looking" as I want. Even though its violated quite often the standard is (in america) you need reasonable suspicion and probable cause. "He uses bitcoins...criminals could use bitcoins...lets search him to make sure hes not a criminal." Do you really agree with this kinda of thought process? 


You are correct, if I wish to transfer my bitcoins into USD then because I am choosing to 'play their game' as it were, they can tax me. If I was to buy/trade 100k value in bitcoins for a house, their is nothing you can do about it. My bit coins aren't taxed and I just sold some textbooks I owned to someone for bitcoins. I also bought silver with bitcoins. 
On a side note, you mentioned you think that gov't is better at running education systems, well what if the gov't that made the education system decided to teach people curriculum/ideology that directly helps to keep said government in power/ give it more power?
