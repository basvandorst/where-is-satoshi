I always set up an advanced transaction on blockchain with two recipients, but that's because I only use paper wallets once. When I spend ANY bitcoin, I want the change to go to a fresh paper wallet.
If you keep your bitcoins on blockchain, I think there's a feature where they generate new addresses for change or let you specify where change goes.
Either way, a change address is just another recipient in a transaction, whether you set it up manually or automatically.

There are MANY other threads that describe this scenario, and there are many people who think this is happening. One little point, though:


Let's not forget that it's also impossible to get fiat out of Mt. Gox right now. They don't actually have to provide any USD for the bitcoins. They can "buy" them by shuffling some numbers around on their ledgers.

It shouldn't make sense to you.
The best I can tell is that they had some system in place to replenish their hot wallet with funds from the cold wallet... Hence defeating the purpose of having a cold wallet in the first place.
Note to future bitcoin exchanges that pop up:
You can pay someone a decent salary to monitor and replenish the hot wallet. You can hire multiple people and share pieces of a private key between them. It's way cheaper than the alternative (750k missing bitcoins).
Also, accounting. It's real and it helps.

You are absolutely misconstruing what I'm saying about the transaction ID. Perhaps it was you who needed it to be ELY5. 
TWO (or possibly more) TRANSACTIONS ARE CREATED BY PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF TRANSACTION MALLEABILITY. EACH OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE TRANSACTION ID. THEY ARE UNIQUE TRANSACTIONS. ONE OF THEM GOES THROUGH, THE OTHERS BECOME ORPHANS. The Mt. Gox issue comes into play because Gox assumed THEIR transaction would be the one to go through. Hence, the blockchain doesn't agree with them because their transaction, which to be abundantly clear IS unique and DOES have the transaction ID Mt. Gox is expecting, gets orphaned. The only flaw that caused Mt. Gox to lose money is the flaw in their own system. The flaw in Bitcoin was properly documented and has documented workarounds.
By all means, spin it however you want and feel free to continue your ad hominem (I should also note you said I fabricated facts, yet offered no counter-argument or even an example). But to put the blame regarding Mt. Gox's eventual and ongoing (and welcome) demise on transaction malleability because "it was (is) possible to do" is shortsighted finger pointing that is based in fiction.

Anything not spent in a transaction is a mining fee.
If you send 0.1BTC to an address from a wallet containing 1BTC and don't tell the transaction where to send the rest, the 0.9 BTC is awarded to the miner as a fee.
This is why it's imperative that you completely spend the inputs.
In blockchain, what I do... is set up a custom transaction, click the (+) sign to add a second recipient, then put the change address I've already got in my hand in to take the rest of the bitcoin.
[Take a look at this transaction] (
This guy was trying to send a small amount of bitcoin from a wallet that had over 20BTC in it. He didn't specify a change address. He paid 20BTC in transaction fees.
The result?
Change addresses are very important.

Bitcoin on the Metra!
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:57:38
I'll explain it from a reference point of why it affected Mt. Gox.
1. Someone requests a BTC withdrawal from Mt. Gox and grabs the transaction ID.
2. That same person maliciously takes the "guts" of the transaction and re-broadcasts it on the Bitcoin network. The new transaction is given a new transaction ID.
3. If the rebroadcast transaction goes through before the original one that was created by Mt. Gox, Mt. Gox's transaction doesn't go through.
4. Since Mt. Gox did record keeping based on transaction ID (against the advice of the bitcoin developers and the wiki that explicitly outlines this issue, which is owned by Mt. Gox), this malicious person could then claim they never got their bitcoins, and when Gox went to the blockchain, the person's story would make sense.
The "malleability" aspect is the fact that the bitcoin network will accept the "guts" of a transaction and assign it a new transaction ID.
This does NOT allow anyone to alter transactions themselves. The inputs and outputs remain the same. It ONLY affects the transaction ID, which Gox should not have been depending on as the sole means of tracking a bitcoin payment.

1. Unless you're typing your addresses manually, I wouldn't worry too much about a keylogger. If your private key is password-encrypted, yeah, that's a concern. I'm not sure if covert keyloggers exist for Chromebooks (In my experience, always assume they do).
2. This depends on your configuration. Your router isn't likely to get hacked remotely, but make sure things like default administration passwords have been changed. Your wifi is much more likely to get hacked than your router remotely, but the set of people who can do that is substantially smaller.
3. I would be concerned about the storage on your chromebook. It's my understanding that google backs your files up to the cloud automatically with a chromebook. Your private keys are sitting on the cloud at that point.
4. (or 3b) I HIGHLY caution you against keeping your bitcoin IN an online wallet like Coinbase. Most theft of bitcoin has happened because of hacked online wallets (also malware, but the chromebook gives you a lot of protection from that). Instead use an offline wallet. You can generate a bitcoin address on  (load the page, then kill your internet connection, then generate), take that page, print it, then move your bitcoin from coinbase onto that (The QR codes are helpful and also avoid keylogging). It's probably the most secure way you're going to be able to do it without dedicating an offline computer to bitcoin.

It's my understanding that what you said is accurate. They're still charging fees to transfer within Mt. Gox even though you can't get the Bitcoin out.
This means Mt. Gox's fee percentage corresponds to a smaller amount of USD per transaction than it used to.
The bigger questions that remain unanswered are:
1. Does Mt. Gox have their customers' bitcoins or are they running some sort of fractional reserve bitcoin operation?
2. Did Mt. Gox drive the price down on purpose so they could purchase their customers' bitcoins at a low price then sell them on another exchange for a ton of USD in profit?
I'd say they're not losing any money at the moment given the fact that they are the only people who can theoretically access their customers' bitcoins (if they exist)--Meaning Mt. Gox bitcoins could potentially leave Mt. Gox as "real" bitcoins instead of "Goxcoins" as everyone seems to be calling them.
The fact that services that will buy your Mt. Gox bitcoins for real bitcoins have popped up probably sparked a ton of transactions within Gox as well. I doubt they're missing a dime of their own money. We'll see what happens to their users' money, though.

I think calling bitcoin "more secure than Paypal" is a bit of a loaded question. I would say Bitcoin is more "merchant-friendly" than Paypal, as transactions cannot be reversed. It's also FASTER than Paypal because you don't have to wait for the money to clear into your bank account before it's yours. 


It depends on what you define "using" Bitcoin as. If you're talking about spending Bitcoin on goods or services, then the advantages are very quick, confirmed transactions (as opposed to waiting for a credit card to batch process and post). Merchants get their money within about 10 minutes as opposed to a typical 10 days for regular credit processing. The fees are also much lower and are pushed onto the sender. If you're talking about Bitcoin as a means of transferring money from one person to another, think about how long an ACH transaction currently takes in the USA (1 business day for the funds to leave your account, 1 business day for the fed to process, 1 business day for the funds to go into recipient account). This whole process happens within about 10 minutes on the Bitcoin network, as the network IS the clearing house.


Some already do. More are hopping on board every day.


It's all about protecting your private key. Think of the private key as your ATM card and PIN in one. The best way is to store Bitcoins securely in an offline (cold) wallet that was COMPLETELY generated offline. Paper wallets are particularly useful for this. The private key should never, ever live on a computer that's connected to the Internet. Most Bitcoin theft happens through stolen private keys that were not properly stored.

The thermal paper is archival quality. As long as you don't expose it to extreme heat, it's fine. I keep one in my wallet (my real wallet), and it's never done that blackening thing that receipts do.
Regardless, the "Keep" switch will allow you to back the keys up on the device and export to a USB key, which may be safer than the piece of paper depending on your circumstances.
I like it because the QR codes can be used with blockchain.info's mobile app. You can just scan the public address in as a watch only wallet, keep your coins completely offline, and even spend them by scanning the private key at the last possible second to sign the transaction (and if you set up a compound transaction --i.e. one with two recipients--, you can send the change to the address of the next slip you've already printed).
It's neat to have an endless supply of cold wallets that you know have never been on the Internet at the touch of a button.

Miners are the people creating blocks. Normal miners take transactions and roll them into the blocks they're creating. Others just create blocks without transactions in them.

In addition to what Romanizer said, Mt. Gox has single-handedly caused every crash in Bitcoin history.
Good riddance.
PS: My bet on the Gox situation is that they didn't have ALL the coins, but once they drove the price down by shutting down BTC withdrawals, they started "buying" the coins from their users (On credit, since you can't get USD out of Gox either). Once they got to the point where their Bitcoin liability was eliminated, they started selling the excess Bitcoins they "bought" on another exchange to make their USD books balance properly and probably make a fat profit off the top of this whole situation.
My theory involves Mt. Gox being ONLY incompetent (an trying to save their asses), not evil. Of course, the real situation could prove to be much worse or much better. Either way, I think they're done. No amount of transaction limits in the world could stop the run that's going to happen if they open any type of withdrawal back up.

That's what really pissed me off about dogecoin.

Then I realized that the "network" was one machine set up via IRC (like most new ones are) that I couln't connect to and therefore couldn't download the blockchain for the first week the thing existed. Being completely unable to get the blockchain meant not being able to mine. 
I lost interest so quickly. Even though I was there at the beginning, I didn't even get to mine a single coin, and I secretly (and now publicly) hope dogecoin fails. It's obvious that the only people mining for the first week were people who could actually get the blockchain (i.e. the devs).

A truly Jimbo Wales-esque utterance.
An $8 billion market capitalization, millions of users (over 1 million on coinbase alone), and we're "essentially zero."
How about the fact that "essentially zero" people edit Wikipedia? The "community encyclopedia" concept disappeared when Jimbo turned Wikipedia into an edit-by-committee operation. Entire sections of the encyclopedia are literally managed by individuals who revert anything and everything the "community" has to offer.
I personally don't give a shit if you accept bitcoin. What I'd like to see is you not plastering your dumb face all over the front page of Wikipedia every time your "non-profit" "needs more money."

The math problem ("Proof of Work") data defines the block. Blocks are "created" by miners solving the proof of work. Blocks normally contain transactions that the miner has received via the bitcoin network, but transactions are not required to create a valid block.
Empty blocks do serve a purpose to the network. They make "unraveling" the blockchain (e.g. 51% attacks that involve generating a longer chain than the valid one) harder because they count as another confirmation on top of every previous block in the chain.
Eventually the empty block "problem" will go away, as the block reward lowers and transaction fees become more important to miners.

First of all, I think you have a misunderstanding about what the price of bitcoin represents. Each exchange has its own price, but they're generally pretty similar to each other, as we use the exchange price to judge roughly how much fiat currency represents a bitcoin. Any of the major exchanges can cause price fluctuations, and the exchanges normalize pretty readily as people try to play the "arbitrage" points.
What happened here (as far as I can tell) is that Mt. Gox tried to shift the blame for their software being vulnerable to double-spending onto the bitcoin network itself (They blatantly called it a bug in bitcoin)... This is causing people to panic sell.
I wouldn't worry about the day-to-day prices too much. Think long term.

False. Your stretching of a self-proclaimed "ECON-101 Definition" of fiat currency is incorrect. 


any money declared by a government to be legal tender.[1]
state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.[2]
money without intrinsic value.[3][4]
You may not believe Bitcoin has intrinsic value, but people investing in it sure do. I see you've already used an "I disagree but have no facts to back it up" argument on another comment to refute the reasons Bitcoin has intrinsic value, so I won't even delve into that.
But I will offer this link:
And remind you that intrinsic value goes beyond the whole "copper pennies are worth more than a cent" paradigm (i.e. being able to make something out of the physical material of the object).
You may not find intrinsic value in Bitcoins, but if I could take a dollar bill, write the address of someone who lives on the other side of the world on it, throw it up in the air and have it deliver itself within 10 minutes (and also have it still be just as spendable/valuable in their country), I'd consider the intrinsic value of that dollar bill to be much higher than the cost of the linen it's printed on.

Just because it's a "flaw not a feature" doesn't mean it was previously unknown. The fact that Gox's system depended on THE TRANSACTIONS THEY THEMSELVES BROADCAST (Rather than a mixture of addresses, timestamps, and transaction amounts, which are truly the "primary key" in the bitcoin system) spits in the face of the fact that this flaw has existed since the bitcoin network's inception and has been documented since 2011 on a wiki that Mt. Gox OWNS.

This insurance you claim they should have in the double-digit millions... What are the chances they actually have it? I mean we're talking about a company that:
1. Is run by inept senior management
2. Had $5 Million seized for failing to follow US law when doing business in the US.
3. May have lost triple digit millions worth of bitcoin (At the current fake Gox prices, no less)
4. Packed up and retained a "Virtual Office" when a couple of people showed up demanding their money
5. Stopped responding to their customers completely
6. Cleared their entire digital presence without so much as a notice to their customers who were already on edge waiting for news about some clearly very large sums of money that they were trusted to manage
Given the circumstances, I'd venture to say the Madoff situation is likely... Not necessarily because of fraud, but if the leaked document is real and is any indication of their actual status, the estate is basically bare by comparison to their liabilities.
My question is:
If they DO have insurance (a BIG if, unfortunately), what are the odds they're actually paid? It seems to me that they'd probably get denied a claim in the event of fraud or gross negligence. At best, Mt. Gox was grossly negligent if they let 700k+ BTC slowly disappear. At worst, well, I hope their upper management looks good in Orange.

The simple solution is that the exchanges should not be holding Bitcoins directly. Fiat is centralized by design. It works reasonably well that way. Bitcoin wasn't meant to be used that way.

For starters, stop thinking so short on bitcoin. If you bought in at $990, you should have been in this for the long game.
It may be best to cut your losses and do a full conversion back to fiat because you obviously lack the patience and belief in bitcoin (What were you worried about? The coins crashing to 0?).
Maybe next time don't invest your life savings into something you don't trust... Or a single investment vehicle.

Use a paper wallet. Carry more empty paper wallets around with you. Use blockchain.info's website to conduct transactions. Put the rest of your bitcoin (minus the transaction amount and fee) into a fresh paper wallet every time you spend (Set up a multi-recipient transaction) after you've spent from the main one. This way your private key only enters your phone ONE time at the time of the transaction, and the rest of your coins stay in offline storage with a completely unexposed private key throughout the trip.
This is what I love about my Piper Wallet. I can batch print 20 of them and use them in the serial number order they have printed on the bottom.
Keep a backup of the private keys though! If you lose your actual wallet or whatever you're keeping the paper wallets in, you'd be screwed.

Even beyond that, though... Since there's such a panic on Mt. Gox, the price on Mt. Gox has gone down so significantly that most of the major exchange trackers don't even report Gox anymore.
Not to mention the fact that the statement Mt. Gox issued directly blamed a "flaw (vulnerability? Not sure about the actual wording) in the bitcoin network," which caused panic in itself.

Picture that as a box containing 20.199 bitcoins that only he had the key to.
When sending bitcoins, he put 0.05271705 BTC into a box and locked it with a lock that only bitmillions.com had the key to, but he left THE REST of his bitcoin sitting on top of the box as a reward to the miner who confirmed his transaction. In actuality, he should have put that bitcoin in a box with a lock that only he had the key to.
This is the importance of change addresses. Anything that's unaccounted for in a bitcoin transaction will be given as a mining fee.

[There are answers. You be the judge of how surefire they are] (
The short answer is you probably have to pay income tax on the bitcoin when you receive it. When you sell it, if you didn't hold for an entire year, you probably have to pay short term capital gains. Long term if it's been a year.
I'm not a tax attorney, but I'm reasonably certain the people at bitcointax.info have consulted with some.

@_date: 2014-02-20 04:44:08
But I think he does bring up a good point.
Say there's a mining pool some day that makes up 75% of the hashing power on the network. As a result of this pool existing, hashing power goes up exponentially the same way it's going up now.
Then say that pool just stops mining. Every resource from that pool is removed from the network. The difficulty would be much higher than necessary, which would cause the blocks to be much further apart, time-wise, as 75% of the hashing power just disappeared.
The 25% of the hashing power left on the network would have to mine a certain number of blocks (10, I think?) before the difficulty would be adjusted again.
It would definitely disrupt things, but I think it depends on a LOT of computer power going missing very abruptly and for a long time.
EDIT: a 51% attack would be much more profitable, as bogus transactions could be given confirmations. Maliciously, this makes a lot more sense than trying to control difficulty, since there's monetary gain. If you screw with difficulty, I'm reasonably confident the only thing you can do is bring the network to a temporary halt.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:19:31
Wow, way to put a Fox News spin on transaction malleability.
Why shouldn't the developers "shirk blame" onto Mt. Gox? The issue was documented, and Mt. Gox had DEVELOPERS implementing their code.
When you put a signed transaction out on the network, it is NOT an issue if someone else rebroadcasts that transaction and gets another transaction ID. It doesn't cause double spends. It doesn't cause havoc on the network. Depending on something to be unique that is KNOWN TO BE CHANGEABLE was completely on Mt. Gox.
The transaction ID did what it was intended to do in the malleability situations. Each time the transaction was broadcasted, it received a unique transaction ID. Mt. Gox's transactions got orphaned, but they still had unique transaction ID's.
Several other exchanges did not suffer from this problem because they had developers who actually understood what they were doing. Placing the blame on the bitcoin protocol or developers in this case is asinine.
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:15:45

Correct. Bitcoins themselves are "Stored" on the public ledger (blockchain). They don't exist per se "in" your wallet. In other words, there is nothing that has to be "received into" your address on your end. That address just receives bitcoin via the public ledger regardless of whether or not it's ever been "on the Internet" (A concept that many people think applies to Bitcoin wallets, but your wallet doesn't "go online.")
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:07:09
It depends on your wallet client. Some wallets put change back in the same address they came from, others create new addresses.
Basically, think of all the funds stored in a single address as an input. A transaction consists of:
1. The amount you want to send to the recipient
2. Whatever's left over
3. The transaction fee.
From the input, two outputs are defined for the recipient and the change. Whatever is unaccounted for in those outputs is interpreted as a transaction fee.
Some people have accidentally sent some VERY LARGE transaction fees in the past by screwing up at a low level.
EDIT: to actually answer your question: Satoshi said we should use different addresses for each transaction, so some clients do it. The private key for your address is still within your wallet, as your "wallet" is just a compilation of private keys corresponding to the addresses that you control.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:24:30
Coinbase was out of coins earlier this week. There was a big alert box on the buy page that said:


And a checkbox that you had to check to buy the coin explicitly agreeing to those terms. It couldn't have been much clearer.
Normally you can lock in a price at order time... If you ordered the coins now, they would come in full, but there was such a rush on buys earlier this week that they just couldn't fill all the orders.

I think you might be misunderstanding what I'm saying... Or maybe which post I was referring to when I said "above."
To me, a race attack is the so-called 51% attack. Compromised or conspiring nodes work together to include fraudulent transactions in blocks fast enough to out-pace the longest chain. The race being between the malicious chain and the legitimate chain.
Is what you're describing as a race attack the idea that you're trying to pass a second transaction through, hence "racing" the first transaction?
Or is there some third concept I'm not aware of/grasping?

It's not. Neither the OP nor anyone else in this thread have made a compelling argument that this vulnerability in itself would cause someone to gain access to someone else's account. Being able to verify an account exists is VERY different than gaining access to said account.


Coinbase's response indicated that the issue was known. Their page clearly says:

It's my understanding that Coinbase buys from other exchanges.
Sometimes you can at least loosely correlate a large order on bitstamp with coinbase suddenly getting inventory back when they were out of BTC.
I think Coinbase understands that no matter what price they buy at, it's probably lower than the stabilized price for bitcoin.

I mean... The big fluctuation in speculating future prices has a lot to do with the projected market capitalization of bitcoin. Some people think it'll rival things like Western Union or Paypal. Others think it'll rival the US Dollar, which obviously has a sky-high market capitalization.
If you want a "should be in a perfect world" price for bitcoin, you can calculate it fairly easily.
Take the Bitcoin Market Capitalization ($):
 (Currently at about 8.5 Bil)
and the # of bitcoins in circulation:
 (Let's call it 12M)
$8,500,000,000 / 12,000,000 BTC = $708.33 / BTC
This doesn't take factors into account like bitcoins that are lost forever due to missing private keys as well as the fact that bitcoin hoarding naturally drives the price upward a bit because the circulating BTC ends up being lower...
But $708 seems like a good low-side estimate for what it currently should be. Future prices depend completely on interest and people putting fiat into Bitcoin to raise its market capitalization in relation to the USD.

Not to be a tin foil hatter, but if it was an alphabet agency logging in, they probably got the token code from your phone and already know the account is empty.

Well, think about it this way...
Say you have 4 lines on your account. Each one is paying $30 / mo for unlimited data. You're also paying $30 per month collectively for unlimited texts on the old plans AT&amp;T has.... Say $90 or so for the voice plan... $30 for the 3 additional lines to be on the voice plan.
So we're talking about $120 + $30 + $90 + $90 = $330 / mo + AT&amp;T's awful taxes...
On the new AT&amp;T plans, you'd pick how much data you want. 15GB is $130. It comes with unlimited talk and texting, so there's nothing included there. Each smartphone you want to add to the plan is $40 / mo ($160). Total plan is $290, and you have the ability to add data-only devices like 3G tablets to your account for $20 / mo moving forward.
For me it was a no-brainer. Between the 4 of us, we used about 5GB / mo. For individuals, it might make more sense to hold onto the unlimited data.

Current market capitalization of bitcoin is approx. $9 billion ( There are approximately 12 million coins in circulation ( $9,000,000,000 / 12,000,000 BTC = $750 / BTC. Obviously the bitcoin that's "lost" in the system (i.e. those who lost private keys to wallets) will increase the value, as the bottom number gets smaller when we talk about coins in circulation. But without taking that into account, the "normal" price should be around $750 / BTC right now.
Smarter people than I are estimating some crazy high market capitalizations for bitcoin. We know that the bottom number of that equation is 21,000,000 BTC. So when people say it's going to $35k/coin, they're just assuming that the market capitalization will go up substantially, which is the point of pushing bitcoin as a currency... I mean think about the market capitalization of the US Dollar.
Say for example that Bitcoin gets to a 100 billion market cap. $100,000,000,000 / 21,000,000 BTC = $4761/BTC... Bearing in mind that the lost bitcoin thats inherent to the design can only drive that value higher.

To address your second point first...
Your checks have a routing number and an account number on them. Those checks are used to WITHDRAW money from your account. So the routing number and account number are definitely useful for withdrawals.
Second, nobody has to convince you they're trustworthy. I have not once had a problem with coinbase. Others have had their orders canceled because they trigger the fraud detection mechanism. An even smaller subset of those people were actually stealing money from coinbase and decided to publicly slander them in the process to make their claims look more legitimate.
If you don't trust them, don't give them access to an account with more money in it than they need.

Yup. Basically the paper wallet is a human-readable form of your private key.
One thing that FapFlop said above is a bit misleading, though. Your cold wallet NEVER has to connect to the Internet. In the case of things like Armory, your "watching only" wallet can connect to the Internet to give you a true balance indication, but as long as your wallet is SUPPOSED to have the coin, you can spend the coin regardless of whether or not the wallet itself knows it even exists.

The only thing that's stopping me from doing this is the price of Bitcoin. White elephant gifts usually cap at like $20 depending on the family, so telling someone "I gave you 1/50 of a bitcoin" might not be so desirable in their eyes.
And of course... If I pulled the highest number, I'd just snag it back. ;-)

The up side to this situation is that you can look at the transaction to make sure it's got a transaction fee attached to it. The chances of being able to double-spend go down significantly when the miners are actually trying to include the first transaction in a block (In fact, it's almost a sure thing the first transaction would be processed first). A 51% hashing power attack on the network could still technically double-spend the coins, as legitimate blocks can be superseded by the blocks the attacker wants... But that's just not going to happen.
Basically, if the transaction looks like it was set up to fail (i.e. no transaction fee), be wary.

On one hand, the available supply has suddenly increased, but on the other hand, the total supply hasn't really changed.
I'm not so sure that having someone pump a bunch of fiat into buying 300K BTC would cause the price to go down.

The fact is that if the service is being provided in your country, your country's laws apply to the service. Why do you think Satoshi Dice is "blocked" from the USA? Because our online gambling laws are unclear at best.
Being currently situated in the UK (Yes, we 'muricans DO leave our own country every now and then), I don't see a problem with using bitcoin gambling services, but if I had an issue, I would act under the (correct) assumption that UK law applies.

It's 100% about the attitude. I generally do look for Coinbase threads because they're the "exchange" (I know, we don't call them an exchange here) that I have the most experience with.
I will concede that the issue was (probably) fixed as a result of this irresponsible disclosure. I mean in actuality they could have just completed their internal timeline on getting that addressed, but that seems unlikely.
But what if they hadn't addressed it? Would you have felt better about this information being in public? I don't think I would have... Despite the fact that I think the "vulnerability" itself isn't particularly useful for an undetected attack. You still have to TRY those passwords, and Coinbase would detect that.

Yes. The bitcoins (which have been verified to belong to the user who has a valid address) have been "signed" over to you, but nobody on the network has confirmed the transaction... Meaning you can look but can't touch, so to speak.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:37:54
That's... A bit wrong.
Bitcoin wallets work on public/private key encryption. You can generate a wallet without any sort of Internet connection, and you can send bitcoins into wallets that have never touched the Internet.
On the machine that's never going online, you generate a wallet. You can then send bitcoins into that wallet, where they will sit without a chance that the private key can be stolen (aside from a physical theft of the device or its paper backup).
When you'd like to SPEND coins out of that wallet, you can create a transaction on a client that IS connected to the Internet, copy it over to the machine, sign it with the private key, then put it back on the internet-connected computer to broadcast it.
Armory does a good job, and they have a feature where you get a "Viewing Only" wallet that will allow you to receive bitcoins and verify payments in real time with the block chain without putting your private key at risk. Their client also has an easy way to do offline transactions in the manner I described above.
As for "password guessing" -- That's not really a thing. In order to access a wallet, the private key must be compromised. The PASSWORD protects the private key. Knowing the password is useless without an encrypted copy of the private key.
The real bottom line here is that your private key should never exist on a machine that's going on the Internet.

Install bitcoin-qt and cgminer. Open bitcoin-qt and wait for it to download the ENTIRE transaction history of the ENTIRE bitcoin network (approximately 4 gigs that have to be processed. Count on it taking 2 days.)
If you want to solo mine (You keep the transaction fees and the reward for the blocks you find... Your odds of finding one are infinitely small), you just start bitcoin-qt with the -server parameter and connect cgminer to localhost.
If you want to join a mining pool, you can take thirty seconds and google mining pools to join and connect cgminer to them instead.
What's realistically going to happen is you'll try GPU mining, and it will shorten the life of your laptop. You'll get a very small amount of MHash/s, and your odds of finding a block are approximately equivalent to getting struck by lightning while winning the lottery while being abducted by aliens.

Good luck to you. Don't install cpuminer. CPU mining is so slow that most mining programs don't offer it as an option anymore. Your GPU is a lot faster than your CPU at these calculations, but an ASIC miner is a LOT LOT faster than both of them.
The last sentence of my post wasn't humor. You really do have a better chance of having all those things happen than you finding a block. Keep in mind that solving a block gives you (currently) 25 bitcoins + all transaction fees for the transactions in that block. With all that BTC being the reward, it's a bit asinine to think you can just generate 1BTC somehow by mining with a laptop at 15M+difficulty.

That is not true.
The PRICE is of the unit fiat per bitcoin. In fact, this is precisely how the price is calculated. The more value of any sort people put into bitcoin will affect its price in a positive way.

One last thing about your plan... You don't necessarily have to generate all of the addresses you're ever going to use at the same time. Addresses you can receive money into can be generated using only the public key.
"A Bitcoin address is a 160-bit hash of the public portion of a public/private ECDSA keypair."
While it may be USEFUL to generate all of the addresses you plan to use, you should be able to create more addresses at any time without the use of your private key.

The transactions may or may not confirm. It's hard to say if it's been this long. Transactions do time out if they don't get any confirmations. So at this point, you're really at the mercy of the miners who aren't being paid to include your transaction in their blocks.
The "spends an input which is unconfirmed" is expected when you try to spend coins you only have in theory (i.e. no confirmations). I think you just need to stay calm and wait it out. It'll sort itself out eventually, and it will be VERY clear what the result is.

If your bank honored the transaction, just sell the bitcoins back to coinbase and have them make a deposit back into your account. I bet they're higher now than when you bought them and you'd make back much more than the overdraft fee.

You bring up an interesting point, but your conclusion is backwards.
Picture all bitcoin wealth as part of a giant pie. As you split smaller and smaller pieces off of the pie, the overall amount of pie available in the world doesn't actually change.
If anything, subdividing bitcoins further aids with deflation because it maintains the utility of the currency as deflation increases its value beyond the point where a satoshi is enough granularity for all transactions. The more people who are using it, the more is theoretically "lost" in the future from private keys going missing, etc.

Coinbase is EXTREMELY trustworthy. The checkbox you're seeing tonight is well-explained if you just read what it says.
"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Friday Nov 22, 2013 at 10:11PM PST after your funds have arrived."
So they don't have any bitcoins left to fill orders (They've run out three times today due to the giant buy storms that were happening today prior to and after the senate hearing), but they're letting you place an order to be fulfilled once the funds arrive (which IS a bad deal [assuming bitcoin keeps going up], but they're being straightforward about it).
Coinbase "takes so long" because ACH transactions in the USA take at least three business days to clear... One of the problems that the use of Bitcoin solves. However, Coinbase lets you lock in your price at buy time (normally, when they're not out of coins), which makes them a much better option than an exchange like Bitstamp where you'd have to wait for your funds to be available BEFORE locking in a price (which means you get to watch the price of bitcoin skyrocket while you're gently weeping/waiting for your funds to clear).
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:11:32
I'm going to answer your questions in reverse order.
1. Your plan kind of defeats the purpose of an offline wallet unless you use TWO USB keys, thus ensuring that your actual wallet never touches the computer with an internet connection (When you spend your money you need to transfer transaction info between the online and offline PC to sign the transaction with your private key). If you used the same USB key as you had your cold wallet on, it would be as vulnerable as a wallet on your online PC.
EDIT: On second thought, you could just put the transaction on the actual hard disk if you're using the same PC.
2. Yes, I'm using Armory. It works beautifully.
3. Yes, you can trust armory for several reasons:
- The wallet is generated offline and nobody has a record of it happening except you.
- The "viewing only" wallet only uses your public key information, so if it's hijacked, the only thing they can do is get a list of which addresses correspond to your wallet.
- You don't have to even boot your cold wallet computer up to receive funds (More of a perk than a security feature)
I HIGHLY recommend Armory.

They told him the issue was "obviously known."
They told him it lacked the severity the whitehat program requires for compensation.
He just refuses to accept it and started a disparaging thread that seeks to "warn" people who might actually find a vulnerability that gives access to a user account or allows someone to steal BTC against reporting it. Then on top of that, he published the item they refused to compensate him for... Something that I'd personally be considering prosecuting him for if I were Coinbase.

The money you send from coinbase will have a delay as it processes through the network, but generally coinbase processes the transaction pretty quickly. You'll just need to wait for a couple of confirmations to ensure it went through. Your wallet doesn't have to "be online" for the funds to arrive.


You don't even have to wait for the transfer to clear. There's nothing your client has to do to "accept" a bitcoin transfer.


Satoshi indicated in his whitepaper that it's best to use a new receiving address for each transaction. The so-called "51% attack" supposedly becomes useless if you use a different address for each transaction. That said, addresses are reusable. It's just a convention people seem to follow.


A bitcoin wallet consists of a private key and a public key.  The public key (in an encoded form) is actually your bitcoin wallet address. In order for a transaction to be valid, a bitcoin transaction has to be "signed" by the private key corresponding to the address containing the funds. This (and this alone) is what dictates that YOU own the bitcoins. If an attacker gets a hold of your private key, they can transfer them anywhere they want. The point of taking your machine offline is to ensure that your private key is NEVER stolen by malware, which could already be installed on your computer. This is why people generally recommend that you generate the private keys on an offline machine and keep it offline forever.


Bitcoins themselves are actually "stored" in the block chain. When a block is mined, a new "input" is created with the freshly-mined coins in them. This input is actually a transaction that occurs from "nowhere" into the bitcoin address of the miner. From there, a bitcoin (or part of that bitcoin) can change ownership through the public ledger and the process of signing/broadcasting/confirming transactions. If you picture the public ledger as a HUGE filing cabinet with all the bitcoins in existence on it, the process of a transaction would be more like moving the coins from one file to another in the cabinet. The neat thing about bitcoins is that as long as you have the private key, you have control over value that's sitting in public. The scary thing about bitcoin is that if someone gets your private key, they have complete control over your stake.

Funny how this graph is showing a little V shape, which is obviously indicative of the bubble that has "pop'd."
It's gone up more than $30 per day the last three days. Now we get a million threads about the bubble popping when it shows any volatility in the other direction. DAT BUBBLE.

All of this advice to "not tell them why" is pretty silly. If they're going to steal the bitcoins, they're going to be looking for them regardless of whether or not they're mentioned.

Throwing my hat in for Schwab as well. No minimums, and they give you an investment account to go along with it in case you ever want to get involved in stocks/fiat investing.
In fact, in all the years I've been with them, I've never paid a fee to them for anything. I almost overdrafted my checking account once, and they called me the day before it was GOING to happen to allow me to fix it in time to avoid fees.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:37:08
The first transaction you posted will confirm eventually. It's just continuously getting pushed to the back of the line because it has no fee.
The second one looks like it's already confirmed? 274 confirmations means the BTC should have been spendable 268 confirmations ago. Is that money not showing up in your wallet? Are you sure it's the right transaction?
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:44:03

You're about 6 months too late (but more realistically a year or two for mining on a computer, versus an ASIC miner)
I have a stupid block erupter running on my computer in the very very very off chance I hit the lottery, but it's never netted a ~~dime~~ satoshi.

This has happened to me with every coinbase transaction as well. Best not to KEEP bitcoin in coinbase because the confirmation will take a bit longer due to the two transactions. I was freaked out at first, but it's fine. They'll both go through.

There were way better "proof" posts he could have referenced, but he was too lazy to go past page 1 in my profile.
I think it's hilarious that you think for a minute that I'm associated with Coinbase beyond being a satisfied customer. The real Coinbase "shills" are open about that, and their presence on this subreddit has been historically celebrated.

As long as you have a way to sign and broadcast transactions (which is why you need bitcoin-qt for your "online" computer's watching wallet), you can do this.
As far as I know the only realistic way to manually broadcast a transaction on the network requires bitcoin-qt. I may be wrong about that, though.

It clearly didn't meet the criteria listed on the whitehat page for coinbase.
When you go around asking people to "honor [you]" it makes you sound as self-absorbed as you do in the original e-mail itself.
Discouraging people from reporting vulnerabilities under the whitehat program because you didn't get paid for finding what's arguably not even a problem is just lame.

*BEWARE* that a LOT of people have reported EXTREMELY delayed shipments from Butterfly Labs to the point where the equipment they get is only good as a paperweight by the time it arrives because of the difficulty increase while waiting for shipment.
The prices look good until you realize that it'll be near impossible to mine a single coin with the thing by the time it arrives.

The ONLY problems I've seen reported about Coinbase is that they sometimes cancel orders as high risk. I've also heard that when that happens, they're usually able to clear it up and honor the original transaction.
Coinbase works great for me, and now all members who complete level 2 verification can buy 1BTC instantly without waiting 30 days.
Great, GREAT service.

Over-moderation is the reason I've had a reddit account for years but haven't contributed.
It's a discussion thread. People want to discuss things, and all you have to do is not read the messages you don't want to read.
This whole philosophy of "I don't like this content because it's not tuned to my tastes" is asinine. This isn't buzzfeed. Sometimes you're going to be disinterested in a post. Just downvote it and move on.
Moderate the spam, direct noobs to the FAQ, and move on with your life.

Actually, two points:
1. If you have unlimited iPhone data, they can assign you to the grandfathered android version of the same plan and vice versa.
2. AT&amp;T lowers your speed after so many GB used per month. However, their new family share plans let you split a crapload of data without speed limiting.
The new plans are actually better than having unlimited data depending on how much data you're actually consuming. I told myself I would never abandon my grandfathered unlimited data plan, but if you crunch the numbers it makes a lot more sense to do so if you have more than one line on your account.

Reading that article seriously hurt my eyes.
I don't see this "vulnerability" as a threat. The more miners you get in one pool, the more blocks they'll solve... Sure...
But the more people in a pool, the smaller the BTC per share becomes. It makes sense that people would keep mining in more than one pool, not band together for less BTC while simultaneously hurting the currency.
Most of these statistics that count on EXTREMELY large, vast, worldwide groups of people being malicious in concert are bunk.

Exactly. You locked in your order at a specific price when they had bitcoins in stock to sell. If you go into your transaction history, it'll say exactly how many bitcoins you're getting and exactly when they'll be available in your account.

Say I have 1 BTC sitting in Address ABC123XYZ.
Say your receiving address is ZZZ111AAA
I come to your store and rack up a (whopping) 0.01BTC bill. I create a new address to receive my 0.99 BTC in change. Call it ABC000ZZZ:




Because I'm planning to double-spend this 0.01 BTC, I don't attach a transaction fee.
After I pay you and am Long Gone™, I set up another transaction.




The chances of the transaction with a fee hitting the block chain first are high, since small fee-less transactions in Bitcoin are considered to be spam (though I think it needs to be even smaller than 0.01), but regardless, it will take a LOT longer for a fee-less transaction to hit the block chain.
In general, double spending IS a risk, but I would argue that the chargeback risk of taking credit cards is MUCH higher.
For large transactions I would wait until there are at least 2 confirmations before I consider myself to be safely paid.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:47:36
Coinbase's normal orders can't be cancelled. Picture this: You lock in an order at $800 per bitcoin. Two days later it tanks to $200. You try to cancel your order, and you leave coinbase holding the ball.
If you did in fact place an order and agree to get the Friday price, it's my understanding that Coinbase gave those people the opportunity to cancel.
Honor your commitments. When you committed to buy, you agreed to a legal agreement. It's not Coinbase's fault that they don't give you an opportunity to renege.
I think the lesson to be learned here is that you could have kept the coins for two more days and sold them at a profit instead of being so shortsighted and managing to lose money in a bullish market.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:35:29

I didn't max mine out, but I did contribute to the percentage point where my employer stops matching.
I don't think 401(k)'s and IRA's are as sound as people make them out to be. There are a whole host of reasons why those can dive to the ground just like Bitcoin. That said, I'd be a moron to leave matching money on the table.

I confirmed an account, despite the outrageous ID requirements.
1BTC minimum and no way to put USD in.
This really REALLY bugs me:
"Please note that all bitcoin deposits are temporarily being processed manually. We are currently processing deposits between the hours of 10:00am and 8:00pm Eastern Standard Time.
Additionally, please note before your transfer that there is currently a 1 BTC minimum trade size."
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:27:28
I agree. Coinbase gets some highly undeserved flak for denying transactions that look suspicious to their system. Never mind the fact that they honor the price in transactions that later prove to be legitimate.
I love coinbase, and not a single transaction I've ever done with them has ever been delivered late or declined.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:34:38


This is what you checked a box agreeing to. They explicitly had a separate checkbox you had to click agreeing to this. Sorry about your luck, but they should still be a fine investment in my opinion.

Yes it's illegal.
They are providing a service to US Residents (thus "doing business" in the USA legally). When they accept money from a US resident, they are bound by US law.
The "Contract" that bitbet follows (which is really an FAQ) is legally unconscionable (and hence unenforceable in its entirety). They have also committed acts of grand larceny (and/or criminal conversion) in taking possession of his bitcoin and failing to provide the service they were paid to provide.
I'm not a lawyer. This isn't legal advice. The people involved are probably untouchable... Even though grand larceny is a felony.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:14:41
I think you have a bit of a strange idea of how a double spend works.
A double spend won't be confirmed unless it happens through a compromised/nefarious node.
The behavior you're describing would only be possible with a so-called 51% attack where the attacker is generating blocks faster than legitimate blocks are being generated.
I double spent once to see if I could do it. I sent a 0.000001 BTC transaction without a fee, then re-spent the same bitcoins to a different address with a fee. As expected, the transaction fee transaction came through first, thus nullifying the first transaction.
Basically, if you're getting ANY confirmations on your transaction, you're safe almost 100% of the time.
I think you're being a bit paranoid about fraud that would take some major balls to try to pull off in person.
