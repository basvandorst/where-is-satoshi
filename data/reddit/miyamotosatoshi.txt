Did Ver tell you to buy it and expect short term gains? Or is it just that you can't take responsibility for your own decisions and need others to blame...
Just unreal...
Who are you gonna blame when BTC price goes down? Because I promise you it will. No price moves only in one direction, no matter what it is.

This. It will harm Bitcoin's scalability, because (it could be argued) the theoretical maximum has to be taken into account when increasing the block size, even though it's improbable that we ever see such blocks.


I don't find SegWit very conservative.


I don't think this is what it's about. Nothing wrong with a gradual increase, but the increase with SegWit is so negligible even at 100%. Is such a small one time increase really worth implementing such a complicated system?
A normal block size increase can also be done gradually. For example set a block number for a future increase as Satoshi suggested. This can be done multiple times. Or implement a dynamic block size increase that is based on how full the blocks are like people such as Gavin have suggested.

So you're saying you think Satoshi was wrong? Why do you care then about making it work if you think the basic idea of Bitcoin is wrong?
Bitcoin is all about the blockchain. If no blockchain, it's not Bitcoin. If the builders of "2nd layers" think they're smarter than Satoshi and their non-blockchain thing is better than Bitcoin in the exact use case Bitcoin was meant for, then why don't they just go make their own altcoin? Why are they clinging on to Bitcoin?
