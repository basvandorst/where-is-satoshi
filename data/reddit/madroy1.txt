I am afraid the same stuff that happened in 2014 happens all over again and the price keeps going down or sideways for a while until it goes below 5K.  What are you guys doing? selling or hodling?
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:08:12
Come on, lets get it to $5,000.
Lets get it cheaper!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:28:59
That might be a good idea, although i will probably sell half and i will buy back again once there is stability regardless if the price is higher or lower than now. I will probably sell in USDT as i see that Tethers price is stable as the US Dollar so i wont have to pay taxes.

I read an article saying that the minister of south korea is planning to ban bitcoin next week after they raided the big cryptocurrency exchanges and then there are several articles and people commenting on here that is all FUD. Which one is it then?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:59:42
As far as i know in the USA you pay taxes when you convert your cryptocurrency into FIAT. i am not planning on converting my coins into FIAT.
How are the IRS treating Bitcoins?
The IRS produed guidance in 2014 on the specific treatment of Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies, which has helped clarified the situation. Essentially:
Bitcoin is a personal property, not a currency, and so is taxed as a capital asset
Gains made from converting Bitcoins into a fiat currency are subject to capital gains tax
Purchases of goods or services with Bitcoins must also account for gains
Bitcoins and other alt-coins obtained from mining is recognised income immediately at their fair value
Mining equipment can still be deducted as a legitimate business expense
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:45:56
Yeah i have just read a few articles regarding cryptocurrency taxes in the US and it does look like that even if you sell a coin for another altcoin you still have to pay taxes on that, not just FIAT. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:43:47
Looks like a bearish market to me. Market cap is quite high to keep going up and up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:00
just saw it!!!
holly shit man..
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:45:34
What is the next price resistance? $7200?
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:07:40
Its going below $5000 guys!
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:59:42
This is going below $5000!
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:48:26
what is the next price support?
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:08:39
You are right. We ll probably reach 7K again
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:53:26
should i buy right now or wait a few months in case the price keeps dropping?
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:09:33
In what price is the current support?   $7800?
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:50:43
every time btc price rises quickly people say the same thing and it ends up dropping as always.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:40:09
Exactly! this is not the correction yet, when it happens it will probably last from a few days to several weeks. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:33:23
Right :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:29:52
Already cashed out to fiat because the correction of this quick rise of bitcoin price is going to be insane. Will try to buy on the dip once this bull run finishes :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:57:39
I predict the correction will be at less than $3000
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:30:55
I predict it will go down to $3000 or less

who is pumping btc? the bankers?
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:45:34
what is the next price support?
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:46:35
why is it falling so fast now?
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:01:44
Because they are a U.S Company and due to regulations they are forced to ask for these types of documents. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:17:37
In the US you can use Gemini and Coinbase but you are going to have to provide your ID to get verified and be able to buy bitcoin. The verification process takes like 2 weeks to 2 months on these exchanges so if you do not want to wait that long buy it on Localbitcoins with several payment methods.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:36:31
So there are still more than 150,000 bitcoins waiting to be sold and the price is already $8k-$9k already. This time it sure goes below $5k.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:26:29
Just did that. With all the MTGOX coins that are going to be sold and the FUD is happening the price is going to crash hard.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:22:52
5K Coming soon guys.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:19
Whats going on with that?
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:43:02
Do not sell at this point man, it is too low. Just HODL. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:44:05
It just broke the $8000 buy walls. fuck.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:37:45
Thought the price was going to rise up after they went live but it is just going down
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:18:52
Based on all the FUD regarding the tether/bitfinex problem, china blocking access to foreign exchanges and the koreans issues with crypto it looks like it might have a quick bounce only so if you want to cash out it might be a good idea.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:58:33
Exactly, at the moment i am writing this the price is at $3007 and its been staying there for a while now. There is no resistance at $3000 anymore so it looks like it is going to keep going down.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:56:30
Dead bounce cat maybe?

@_date: 2017-09-15 15:46:18
what do you guys think about this quick rise of $700 dollars in a few hours? did the price dropping is over already?
The problem with the chinese banning bitcoin and the fork happening on November is not over yet so i think the price is still going to drop
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:32:37
Is this a bull-trap?
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:21:40
I was waiting for a bigger correction to $4000 or less but it looks like its not gonna happen. should i wait more to see if it drops lower or buy now at $4600?
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:54:42
Dead bounce cat? what do you think?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:45:27
Is this a bull trap? what do you guys doing, selling or hodling?
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:08:58
I am wondering if the price is going to drop close to 40% like the last time where it went from like $3000 to $1700-1800.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:18:22
Yes i know that. These MTGOX coins have been selling since bitcoin reached its ATH and helped to crash the market to $6,500. That plus the FUD that is occurring right now are going to crash the price hard. There is really no support right now so this is easily going below $6500.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:07:07
Damn, $300 in a few hours.
Who the hell is dumping all that bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:12:22
Below 6K now.   Dip might be over here so buy some before it reaches $5,000 and wait for the rebound
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:16:21
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:45:54
I will definitely wait

We are in a bear market and we are heading to $5k or below.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:29:31
Dude, you are going to easily make more money if you invested in the altcoins that have a good team running them.  Right now the altcoins are going down because all of the bitcoin hype that is going on and people trying to get some free btc gold but just wait until the next altcoin bull run and you will see that you are going to have more money that if you had invested in bitcoin only because good altcoins  tend to rise X2,X3,X4 when prices start going up so just wait and do not sell them.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:48:06
I bought it for $2200 hoping it will go up so i am not sure if i should sell it or wait until it rises back up. What are you guys doing? selling it or waiting for bitcoin to rise up again?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:50:28
It is $1960 now. Holly shit...
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:56:37
The price already went below that in the last minutes. What happened to this order? did he buy the 8,000 BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:03:58
Have not you seen the 1 week price chart?
This could easily go to $1500 within the next week. I predict btc  is going to hit $1000 or less within this month.
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:15:21
So is there going to be a btc chain split? until yesterday i thought that was not going to happen....
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:28:20
Bitcoin is already at $2140, should i sell now or do you guys think is going to recover this crash?
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:09:10
It will continue going down and down until august 1st. Its probably better to buy after august 1st
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:06:40
I predict this will hit $1000 within this month.
Hopefully it does so i can buy more btc
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:44:33
So there is going to be a btc chain split? until yesterday i thought that was not going to happen....
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:31:09
Dude bitcoin just keeps crashing down and down. It just hit $2200. I think it is not safe to buy at this point because btc price could drop to like $1000 in a matter of days or it could happen the same thing that occured in 2013 where bitcoin hit $1200 and from there it just kept going down till it reached $200.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:19:52
Yeah i already know about segwit but i am afraid the same thing could happen as in 2013, that bitcoin hit $1200 but it kept dropping and dropping only to recover a few years later.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:18:55
looks like it keeps going down and down since the last week
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:57:23
I think coinbase is united with gdax.com
if you already have an account on coinbase you automatically get an account on gdax. Use gdax to trade btc and not coinbase directly.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:47:31
it went down to $2550 from like $2800
is it time to buy now? or it will keep going down?
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:56:54
bitcoin just went down like $250 in 2 hours, time to sell now?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:16:26
IT went down to $2300 from $3000.
What are you guys going to do? sell or buy? i do not even know what to do because the price keeps rising but a little after that it goes down again and way lower than the last time. I am afraid the price will go down to like $1000.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:20:00


Damn....you have to change to another cryptocurrency trading site. Most of the most popular ones only charge .20% to sell btc.   Which means that if 1 btc is $2800, the fee will be 5.6 US Dollars to sell.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:39:59
Yeah but bitcoin hit $3000 a few days ago and it just hit $2200 a few minutes ago. I am afraid the same thing that happened in 2013 is going to happen now that bitcoin reached like $1200 but it went down  to $200 in less than 2 months.
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:15:15
I was hodling too but based on the bitcoin price of the last days and the august 1st madness, it looks like it is going to keep crashing so i am hoping it keeps going down and the buy it back at the dip
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:54:59
I am selling 50% of my bitcoin hoping after august 1st it continues to crash down and then buy back at around $2000 or less. What are you guys doing? holding or selling and then buying at the dip?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:56:55
Bitcoin hit $2400 LOL
What do you think? should i sell now between the $2600 range and wait to see if it drops to $2000 and then buy at that range? Do you guys think it will drop down that low?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:58:22
dont you think is going to keep dropping down?
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:12:49
So what phase is it at this point?
because it looks like bitcoin is going down and down
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:31:22
I hope it raises up again because it looks like its going to continue dropping and dropping
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:10:31
As usual when the coins are crashing.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:57:40
I am seeing it now LOL
It was just going down so quickly that i panicked and sold half my bitcoin. Luckily i was able to sell it for $2600 so i am buying it cheaper now :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:21:10
It just went down to $2700, should i sell now or wait till it bounces back up a little to sell? what are you guys doing?
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:03:25
That is what i think too. It will keep dropping and dropping till it hits $1500 or so
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:18:03
time to sell or buy?
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:24:26
If you want to sell bitcoin on coinbase they will buy it for a 1.5% fee of the transaction. Fee to trade bitcoin on gdax is 0.25% or less. If you are the taker you pay no fee to buy or sale. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:50:23
too much money on what sides?
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:05:56
Well, the claim is that it is a fact that bitcoin crashed to $200 from more than $1200 in matter of months.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:11:32
What is most likely to happen on aug 1st? will it keep dropping or rising?
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:58:20
Keep hodling dude
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:35:52
Dropped nearly 6% in 24 hours just now, time to buy.
