It is called ACH and no it isn't complete in a day.  Not ever.  Just because you bank deducts it from your account at time X doesn't mean it appears in the destination account at time x.
3-5 business days is standard for ACH.  Note that is business days to exclude weekends, holidays, and banking outages.

Thanks for your interest jesset77.  I agree a healthy amount of skepticism is important when dealing with irreversible payments.   No offense was taken from your comments.  
We manually approve outgoing payments to prevent fraudulent use of our system.  The majority of the sales process is completely automated but the sales portal is "cold".  It has no access to the offline bitcoin wallet and no ability to send payments.  Our relationship with PayPal is different than a normal consumer account.  PayPal requires we use certified (irreversible) funds and payments we issue are nearly irreversible (there are limited exceptions for fraud that results from failure on PayPal part).  Disappointingly PayPal provides no mechanism to allow end receivers to see how payments were funded or sent so you should never rely on anyone's claim (including ours) that a payment can't be reversed.  I only bring that up to illustrate the absolute need for manual processing.
We take security seriously.  Manual approval with second factor authentication is just one element of our focus on end to end transaction security.   We also use encrypted databases, off-site mirroring, intrusion monitoring, real-time admin alerts, SSL, "cold" wallet, bcrypt (brute force resistant) hashed passwords, hardcoded sale orders, and preset refund addresses to ensure all transactions are processes quickly and securely.  Our goal is to design a system where the benefits of hacking are minimized. Keeping our fraud &amp; theft losses down ensures we can offer the best price to our loyal bitcoin sellers.
In response to your &amp; xioustic concerns we have lowered our minimum tx to $50.00 on PayPal &amp; Dwolla.  We encourage you to consider diversifying away from PayPal. We also offer payouts by check, bank wire, and ACH.  If you aren't comfortable sending funds to your bank account consider using a prepaid credit card.  Many cards allow you to have funds direct deposited there, so you can use our ACH payout to send funds to your card.  Later this month we will be adding a "direct to prepaid" payout option which will allow you to direct the proceeds of your sale right onto a prepaid card instantly (well after six confirmations and manual verification).
If you have any other recommendations or concerns about our service please let us know.  We will start monitoring reddit for feedback in addition to bitcointalk forum and our traditional contact methods.

No mistake.  That is the point.  
A $99 tracfone card for $95 (if you pay in Bitcoins).
We have looked into a bitcoin "white label" cellphone service. A white label is where a virtual carrier is just buying wholesale airtime from a major network and handles billing, customer support, and activation.  H20 Wireless or SimpleMobile are examples.  It certainly is possible but the upfront costs means Bitcoin needs to have a significantly wider base (maybe 10x the number of active users).

I wouldn't say "free". It may be free but you may also be required to pay a fee if your transaction consists of a large number of small inputs.  If you wanted to increase the chance your transaction is included in the next block it is recommended you pay a small fee (fractional bitcent) for priority processing.  
So Bitcoin isn't always free as in free beer, but it is always free as in free speech. Still even if a fee is required (or optionally added to increase the speed of inclusion in a block) the cost is incredibly low.  Other methods (check in the mail, credit card, ACH, bank wire, western union, suitcase of cash, etc) would all cost many magnitudes more, and many would face significant risk of fraud or reversal.

You are correct but not the conclusion,
RIPEMD broken = version 1 addresses broken.  Bitcoin is extensible.  If there is even a theoretical academic weakness to RIPEMD-160 (one that over the following year or decades could develop into a real world attack vector) developers could design a version 2 address using a new hashing scheme (or just the plain public key).   Long before the weakness becomes anything more than an academic curiosity users could move funds from "old" address to "new ones.
Granted I don't mean to trivialize this, it would be a hard fork, it would require time, and planning, and for miners and users to upgrade but it can be done.  
RIPEMD-160 broken = version 1 addresses are POTENTIALLY compromised.  Potentially is important to consider because take for example SHA-1 it is compromised but it requires on average 2^61 operations to find a collision (better than 2^80 by brute force but still a LOT of hashes).  To put it into context, using cloud computing the cost per collision on SHA-1 hash is roughly $2.7 million USD.   Thus even if hypothetically Bitcoin used the compromised SHA-1 algorithm it wouldn't be economical to attack an address (the cost of the attack would be more than the value of the coins stolen).  Of course if Bitcoin did use SHA-1 for version 1 addresses a big priority right now would be migration to more secure version 2 addresses.

Xiuoustic you certainly get the concept of transaction security.  Every major hack/theft in bitcoin history involved the use of "hot" (online) wallets.  IMHO the small gains is convenience do not warrant the risk of catastrophic financial loss.  While our outgoing payments aren't bitcoins the same security model applies.  If it is online it can be stolen.  If it is offline fraud and theft is much more difficult.
Our system is designed slightly different from your concept above but the general idea remains the same.  The front end is only for gathering, validating, and displaying information.  All transaction processing is done from a separate hardened single use console which is powered off except during batch processing.

Yup just like Silver and Gold are wildly volatile.  Er wait they aren't.  I mean they are volatile compared to USD:EUR exchange rate but much less volatile than BTC:(anything) exchange rate.
The value of all Silver Bullion is on the order of $20B and the value of all Gold Bullion is on the order of $10T.  The daily trading volumes have similar ratios too.  The intraday volatility of gold is much lower than silver which is much lower than Bitcoin.
Long story short it takes very large &amp; deep markets to dampen price swings.  This is true even in so called "real currencies".  Global GDP is $80T annually but Global Forex trading is $1,300T, no since I love the word quadrillion it is  ..... $1.3 QUADRILLION USD (equivalent) annually.
So will Bitcoin even more mainstream (it is already legitimate)?  Who knows?  Bitcoin may go to nothing or may become so large that the days of measuring exchange rates in "full BTC" will seem quaint.  Its success or failure has nothing to do with in a fixed supply.

It is at the client level only.  The network wouldn't care if you made a 0.5MB tx consisting on nothing but 1 satoshi inputs and 1 satoshi outputs with no fee.
If a miner mined it and included it in the next block it would be valid.
Then again most pools use the rules of the default client so it unlikely that non-standard tx will be included in a block unless you get someone to mine it for you (or mine it yourself).

nlocktime doesn't do what you think it does.  Also nlocktime isn't something specific to multi-sig transactions.

The mining reward will go to exactly zero in block 6,300,000.  This is due to the protcol having a fixed number of digits.  At that point the total number of coins minted will be ~20,999,999.9769 BTC.
One could say well if the protocol is modified to have more digits then more coins (but still less than 21M) could be minted, however Bitcoin is the protocol rules which are agreed to by consensus.  While those rules could be changed to allow more digits they could also be changed to increase the 21M cap, or keep block reward at a static amount.  We don't know if any of those changes will ever happen.
The only thing we do know is that the protocol as it exists today will stop minting new coins in block 6,300,000 which if the 10 minute per block target is maintained won't be until the year 2140.

Then don't make the stock a significant percentage of the colored coin.
Simple solution huh?
I mean the threshold is half a penny now twenty dollars.  IF one had an asset worth 10,000 BTC they could issue 100,000 shares.  Each share has a real value of 0.1BTC and costs 0.0000543 BTC.  The issue cost is 0.05%.
Yes this means that trying to do "kiddie stock" nonsense where you issue a billion shares and each share is worth a negligible amount is no longer viable but that never served any purpose to begin with.

Yes.  That is the basis of a deterministic wallet.  The reference client is just a random bunch of keys.  If it needs a new key it makes up another random one and records it.  Everything works fine until due to error, old backup, etc you no longer have all the keys.  Since they are randomly created you are SOL.
A deterministic wallet has a seed (a master key if you want to think of it that way).  All the keys are produced from this seed.  Now if someone steals your seed they have essentially stolen your wallet as they can reproduce your entire wallet including every address you used and every address you will use in the future.  As long as you keep the seed secure you can always reproduce your wallet.
There is one IMPORTANT limitations.  Many deterministic wallets allow you to import an outside key.  Obviously this outside key is just a random key.  It has nothing to do with the seed.  So you will need backups if you want to keep this outside key safe.  If that seemed confusing the simple version is as long as you don't import any outside keys everything can be reproduced from the seed.

"high enough priority"  thus trying to repeatedly transfer coins back and forth doesn't work.
After the first tx the inputs 0.01 BTC each would need 100 days before they could be spent without a fee.
The rule of thumb on priority is "one bitcoin day".  If you have a 1 BTC unspent output you can use it for a new tx in one day without a fee.  If you have a 10 BTC unspent output you can sue it in a new tx in 2.4 hours (1/10th of a day) without a fee.

There is a cost to everything.  The blockchain is no exception.  Bitcoin was never will suited for sub cent transactions.  "micro" as in $0.50 maybe but not sub cent transactions.  Worse due to fee requirements on low priority tx most sub cent transactions are NEVER spent they simply bloat the UXTO making the entire network less efficient.

5430 satoshis has a value of 1/15th of a US penny.  Enough said.  This is a tempest in a teacup by a small but vocal minority.  There is micro-tx and then there is pathetically worthless and uneconomical tx.   
Tx this small end up being unspendable because they will require a fee and thus the fee ends up being more than the tx is worth.  This means the tx never end up being spent and remain in the UXTO "forever" greatly reducing the efficiency of the entire network.  
For full nodes (not just miners) to validate tx and blocks efficiently the UXTO (set of unspent outputs) needs to be in memory.  Even today roughly half of the UXTO consist of spammy garbage unspent outputs (value below current min tx fee for low priority txs).  This means that there is a good chance many of them will never be spent and remain in the UXTO forever. As time goes on Bitcoin will only become less efficient (UXTO is increasingly bloated, fulll nodes require more memory, tx validation takes longer, etc) unless changes like this are made.

The 5430 satoshi dust threshold is simply a DEFAULT value.  Miners can make it anything they want (even 1 satoshi) by simply changing a value in a config file.  
If the valuation of a BTC skyrockets I would imagine future versions of the client will adjust the default to something more realistic.  The min tx fee requirement for low priority txs for example initially was 0.01 BTC and has been reduced three times.

By definition if they run out of stock they can't sell any more.  Any lower price would simply mean they get less revenue.  
WHEN they can't sell out they will lower the price.  I mean it is basic economics.
If you are a widget maker and you can only make 1000 widgets a week.  You currently sell out every week at $1 per widget why would you lower your price even if you can build them for $0.01 each?
When demand falls such that you are still producing 1000 widgets a week but only selling 500 you might consider lowering the price.
The optimal price (for seller) of any product is the maximum price where the seller still sells off the entire inventory.

2) nlocktime is not specific to multi-sig using it as an answer is at best incomplete.  It would be like if someone asks if bitcoin transactions can be reversed and then saying "yes they can with nlocktime".
3) The question was about escrow.  Nobody would accept a nlocktime tx (even once implemented) for escrow.  It would defeat the very purpose.  If it can be used to "reverse" a tx where escrow agent is missing it can also be used to defraud the receiver.

Of course it matters how it is written.  
MtGox "could" limit traders to a single trade at one price point.  MtGox currently allows discrete trades at the same price (which serves no purpose).  So one can submit 1000 trades of 0.001 BTC @ $200 instead of 1 BTC @ $200.  There is no reason for the former (not even for a bot) it does the same thing as the latter but it uses 1000x as much system resources and costs the same.  That is bad planning, and it is being exploited by those trying to lag the exchanges.
MtGox "could" change fee structure.  Instead of x% it could be 0.01 BTC + y% trading fee.  This would encourage larger orders.
MtGox "could" limit prices to full cents (they currently allow 5 decimal places).  0.01 precision on a $125 asset is 0.008% precision.  I doubt any trader is hurt by not having the ability to get 0.0004% better price especially when there is a 0.6% trading fee.  This would prevent loading the system with 1000 orders between dollar amounts (i.e. 0.001 BTC @ $120.0001, 0.001 BTC @ $120.0002, etc).
None of these are revolutionary but they could have been done months ago to modernize and streamline their processing.  They could also have spent some of the millions of dollars collected in trading fees to build a better processing engine.  MtGox did absolutely nothing.  To say it isn't their fault is laughable.  If bots were bringing the NYSE exchange to a halt day after day would you not blame the NYSE.  
Now I am not saying MtGox "must" make changes but it IS THEIR EXCHANGE.  One can't have their cake and eat it too.  Either they make changes to fix the problem OR it is their fault for not fixing the problem.

Still 600 MH/s will solve a block on average in 625 days.  So you can get ~1.2 BTC per month from a pool OR you could take a 4.8% chance per month of getting 25 BTC (and 96.2% of getting nothing).

Well MtGox is simply ripping users off.  
Almost all paying tx are paying ~0.1 mBTC and they are included in a block.   Furthermore MtGox bundled multiple withdrawals per tx.  Adding another output to an existing tx is &lt;50 bytes.  That is right now 50 KB but 50 bytes.
A tx with 5 inputs and 10 outputs (paying 10 customer withdrawals) would be ~1.2KB.  That would be rounded up to 2KB for fee purposes.  Plenty of 2KB tx are confirmed with just 0.1 mBTC fee but MtGox will be charging 1mBTC per customer for 10 mBTC total or 100x what is required.
So maybe you should ask MtGox why they are ripping you off with fees?

Superior technology was ALWAYS available to attackers.  Nothing prevented an attacker with millions of dollars to deploy from building and using ASICs.  "Defenders" using superior technology prevent attackers from gaining a competitive advantage.  It keeps the battle one of pure brute strength.  The first generation ASICs are just the next advancement of that arms race.
As an analogy imagine no good miner had discovered OpenCL GPU mining.  A single attacker with a few dozen GPU could have 51% attacked the network defended by thousands of CPU miners.  Likewise today a single attacker could wipe out the hashing power of thousands of GPU miners with a few dozen ASIC processors.

a) have inputs with "one bitcoin day" of age

c) be no larger than 10KB
if a tx doesn't meet those rules it can still be created but must include a fee.

No it is a horrible word for it.  The purpose of mining is to secure the network.  In what other "mining" are miners compensated for securing something?
No mining is a weak analogy which doesn't stand more than the most basic scrutiny.
Nodes that build the blockchain secure the network.  In a perfect world they would be pay per performance, that is they would be paid completely by fees.  Of course how do you build a world class network with low transaction volume and how do you hand out the INITIAL distribution of coins.  Satoshi was smart to make miner compensation FEES + SUBSIDY.   There is nothing being extracted.  The protocol defined the subsidy.  Nobody runs into a rich vein of satoshi ore.  Miners get a ever decreasing subsidy and in 4 more halvings it will be a tiny (2% or less) and shrinking portion of miner compensation.

Yes I am aware that people live on a small amount of funds however you haven't shown that tx occur that those picotx levels.

Still MtGox =/= Bitcoin.  Despite MtGox freeze other exchanges are operating.  Those who fear they will be unable to sell on Mtgox after the opening .... have plenty of time to move coins to other exchanges and sell there.

I would point out it is important to remember that bitcoin ALWAYS has a change address (unless spending the full value of a transaction).  Bitcoin can NEVER spend part of a transaction.  Period.  So if you have a 10 BTC unspent output and want to buy a 4 BTC product you will ALWAYS have 6 BTC in change.
The OP got this right but it seems many in the discussion missed this distinction.  The OP is arguing that the default should be to send change back to the sending address.  This gets equally confusing when dealing with multiple inputs and there are many scenarios where one would WANT to consolidate inputs into a single unspent output.
Still if it important that people use the correct terminology (otherwise it adds even MORE confusion) to new users.  
There is always a change address so you have three potential options for a default behavior:
a) send change to a newly generated address &lt;- method used by QT client
b) send change back to the originating address(es) &lt;- method advocated by OP
c) send change to an address specified by user (i.e. always ask and SHOW the user where the change will go) &lt;- IMHO better option
I think c combined with the ability to set the default to be either a or b would be the best overall solution.  It educates and informs the user plus provides flexibility.

Miners are free to include whatever tx they wish in the next block and obviously that means they are free to not include whichever tx they wish.
Miners can't force users to include a specific fee.  Users can't force miners to include a tx in the next block.  The "fee economy" will develop between those two constraints.

Due to the decentralized consensus required for Bitcoin the decimal place will never be moved.  Doing so would be a hard fork, that is unavoidable in any breaking change however this fork likely wouldn't be universally supported so best case scenario it quickly dies out, and worst case scenario you end up with two incompatible "bitcoin" networks both calling themselves bitcoin.

Except fail at doing it.  The "good" currencies like USD have only lost 97% of purchasing power since 1950.
If Bitcoin will become a stable currency it won't he here it will be much higher (think $20B money supply at a min and probably $250B+).  Saying Bitcoin needs to stabilize would be like saying after the first two nodes of the internet were connected it needs to stabilize.  No the next couple decades were chaotic, massive, explosive growth.  
If Bitcoin doesn't fail, stabilization will come but you don't get from $0 to $200B+ without a lot of wild gyrations ("random walk").

You can use the API for a specific time period like this.
the number is the TID (which is also the timestamp of the tx in microseconds since 01/01/1970).   
The API will never return more than 24 hours of data.  If you need a longer stretch you can start at a specific TID, send request look for newest TID, request again using that TID and repeat until you get no results.

If you aren't solo mining then it isn't decentralized.  That "decentralized" miner in a browser is sending all the hashing power to a ... centralized server.
p2pool is the closest thing to decentralized mining with less variance that solo mining.  In essence you ARE solo mining, the rewards are simply shared.

Super is all relative.  A super computer could (depending on the model and amount of GPU resources) mine in the multi TH/s range HOWEVER it wouldn't do so efficiently.  Super computers devote tens of millions of dollars on things like high speed interconnects,  massive memory arrays, and storage area networks all of which contribute exactly 0.000000 h/s.
So while you "could" mine on a general purpose supercomputer if you spent the same amount of funds building a massive hashing farm you could produce a more powerful (albeit highly specialized) system.

There are other exchanges.  They continue to trade.  Hopefully people will realize that MtGox is not where you want to have your money frozen at.  If the market responds and MtGox marketshare falls then problem solved.  If it doesn't, well the the users (collectively) of Bitcoin have decided they want a horribly run, laggy, easily manipulated exchange as the central authority.
The coming weeks will be interesting.  Still MtGox has had less of the overall marketshare for some time now.  They still run the 80% quote but it is dated June 2011.  Prior to this whole mess MtGox average daily share in USD market was more like 60% to 65%.  Once can only hope that after this it falls to at least below 50%.

Bitcoin with a $2B money supply is essentially useless so either Bitcoin will go nowhere or it will get much bigger.  Now tell me how do you get from $0 to $200B in any reasonable amount of time without a skyrocketing exchange rate?
And anything which moves up rapidly is going to attract speculators and weak hands and all the volatility and chaos that comes with it.  That is the short term future of Bitcoin, it is the growin pains of a money supply expanding from a hobbyist concept to significant valuation.  There is no way to do that in a nice orderly controlled manner.
Bitcoin either goes to $0 (or some very low valuation) or it is going much much much higher and the moves are going to be disruptive, explosive, and at times chaotic.   If you just a nice stable currency, unsubscribe, sell your coins (if any) and check back in 10 years.

By default the QT client includes the new 100 keys you will use in the future as part of a keypool.  As long as more than 100 new keys haven't been used since the last backup no funds will be lost.  Even if more than 100 keys were used you would begin to lose some funds (as change is sent to new addresses the obsolete backup doesn't know about) but some funds should still be recoverable.
Still it is good advice
First OP should make multiple backups.  If something exists in only one location it isn't a backup.
Second OP should take one of the copies, copy it into the datadir for the wallet client and sync.  If funds don't show research "-resync" option.

It isn't just a fee issue.  The fee will help but these aren't "traditional" HFT.  They aren't looking to capitalize on tiny price movements and turn a profit on massive volume.  MtGox current fee of a 0.6% spread (min) makes that impossible.  There is no economic reason to place 1000x 0.001 BTC trades AT THE SAME PRICE compared to a single 1 BTC trade.  None.  No HFT anywhere in the  world does that.
If your goal however is to take MtGox bloated, non-responsive, cluster fuck of a trade engine which is currently operating on the red line and push it over the edge resulting in 75+ minute lags and massive panic so the price drops down 50%, 60%, 70% well that 1000x 0.001 BTC works a lot better than 1 x 1 BTC.

This is decentralized at work.  Decentralized doesn't mean people can't work together, organize, petition, etc.  It simply means no central authority.  Now if the OP said something like:
"As acting chairperson of the central agency on quotes and records, that due to MtGox non-compliance of subsection 27 of the uniform quote relay act of 2012, MtGox was by committee vote (5 to 3) being reduced to a Tier 2 quote provider."

Yeah as I said (and from experience) you are wrong.  Is $15M annualized volume and ~$20,000 in banking sufficient to warrant "high volume"?  We never had a single case of fraud, or any complaint from any customer.  BofA (same bank bitfloor used) closed our account after nine months.  The reason given (paraphrased) was "per the deposit agreement we can close any account for any reason at anytime".  No legal action, no freezing of accounts, they didn't even cutoff any services.  Just gave us a 30 day deadline, even "allowed" me to withdraw $18,000 cash on the last day.

Simple version:
Transaction fees.  
However the block reward won't go to exactly zero for roughly 130 years.  Slowly over time the portion of miner total compensation that comes from fees will increase. It already has (in a small way).  Fees make up about 1% to 2% of miner total compensation (with the block subsidy being the 98% to 99%).  A year ago fees only made up about 0.1% of total compensation.

Why not do both?  The two concepts aren't mutually exclusive.
Hold enough coins to cover your buying needs (but no more than you are comfortable given the wild fluctuations).  When you spend some coins, buy some more maybe buy sligtly more (i.e. spend $100 worth of coins, buy $120 worth).  You are always long Bitcoin, you are using it as currency, you participate (good or bad) in any valuation change.
Why do some people think there is this binary choice.
a) you can spend bitcoins
b) you can hold bitcoins
Why not just do both?

If there is an incompatible fork (intentional or accidental) then both continue to exist as long as hashing power supports them.  What would happen is the pool would see that on the main chain nobody accepts their blocks (as other pool and clients would see those blocks as invalid).  This gives the pool a very good reason to become compliant.  The idea of spending huge sums of energy and time to produce something which is worthless tends to motivate people to avoid that.
To end users the only noticable change would be that transactions take slightly longer to confirm (depending on how large the forked pool is).  Even that would "go away" in time as the next difficulty adjustment would lower difficulty to retarget a 10 min confirmation time.

Depends on what you mean by "the system".  The protocol is very secure however if your private keys are compromised an attacker can access your funds.
The solution is hardware wallets.  Devices with an independent keyboard and screen which retain control of private keys and are protected by a PIN.  It doesn't matter if users computer is compromised the private keys are never on the user's computer.
More than one group is working on hardware wallets.  The nice thing is the network doesn't care where or how you store your private keys so no change to the Bitcoin network is required.

Read more or try to get the facts right.  The FBI confiscated ~5% of current Bitcoins in circulation or &lt;3% or total supply.  
3%, 98% obviously the outcomes is exactly the same.  Also the FBI doesn't own them.  They are frozen pending trial and when the trial is complete the DOJ will seek asset forfeiture as procedes of a criminal enterprise.  The DOJ will auction them off like they do billions of dollars of other wealth (houses, yachts, luxury goods, gold, airplanes, stocks, bonds, etc) as part of asset forfeiture.
So that &lt;3% someday won't even be owned by a single person it may be distributed to hundreds or thousands of new owners.

All existing nodes would see that block as invalid and simply drop it.  No different than making a block with an invalid tx, or a miner giving himself 5000 BTC reward instead of the consensus 25 BTC.
If some networks were updated to a &gt;1MB is valid rule and some weren't well that would be a worst case scenario.  The network would split with parts of the network following different chains and tx in one network not necessarily being included in the other one.  Essentially this is the scenario to avoid.
No miner is going to produce a &gt;1MB block until the overwhelming majority of nodes have upgraded to a rule set which makes &gt;1MB blocks valid.
