no,  could change to fiat and then buy property

your mom?

seeing a logarithmic chart of bitcoin growth....and buying at 350 usd.   moonlaunch 2016 strapped in.

comfort yourself?  How about trying to find a clear analogy for the purpose of discussion and to be able to better educate?   
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:23:19
ok, can you present a better analogy, or are you just a useless critic?
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:42:30
No. No it doesn't.  It informs people of cheaper alternatives.  Nothing more.

happy cake day!
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:40:31
no it isnt, america.
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:39:56
it IS a scaling solution?  how?
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:20:04
newsflash: money plays a significant role in crime
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:26:46
calm down
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:37:24
bitcoin's value also depends on utility as well?  the limited  Transactions Per second rate is a hindrance to wide adoption isn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:53:09
so...?  Don't play
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:55:38
wait for the sequel.... Gladiator II : The Return of Satoshi 
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:22:42
here is the pattern  
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:14:37
yes, all that is part of the show
@_date: 2016-02-12 17:17:45
yes, damn that pesky electricity!
@_date: 2016-02-07 10:48:57
what is this, a cake day avalanche?  happy cake day.   moon :)

if you knew the future you'd be rich. Yours is a silly statement unless you are a knife-catching guy with steel balls.  I doubt you are

what do you think about the transaction per second limit?  I have not heard a convincing response that this will be overcome  .....edit: a word
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:10:05
well regarding your second question,  at present there are just not that many users or that many transactions happening at any one time, so at maximum you need to wait a few minutes for the transaction to be confirmed multiple times on the blockchain....but if as many people used bitcoin for transactions as credit cards, for example at thousands or millions of times a second,  the wait time at present would be in the realm of hours and days.....basically, at present bitcoin CANT be as universal as credit cards....but fixes are apparently on the way
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:46:41
no, no, no.....at present the entire bitcoin archetecture can only handle about 10 transactions per second....for the entire world!   don't believe me....ask around.   The core apparently 'needs a fork'  whatever that means.
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:13:00
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:41:38
i have no idea what you just said there....im not a tech guy.....but basically something needs to be changed with bitcoin/blockchain in order for it to be able to process thousands of transactions per second.......and that hasn't been done yet/will take work and collective agreement to modify everything--   you must recognise it is, at this point, an obstacle, small or large, that needs to be overcome-  agreed?
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:26:50
I dont know the answers to these questions.   but look up TPS and bitcoin and you'll get a more detailed answer about transaction limits....it is a real problem limiting bitcoin.   as for the other stuff im not a tech or computer guy.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:48:47
I know,   I mean someone holding a value of bitcoins equal to 1 billion usd, eur, pounds  .....a real walking talking person,  not just the mysterious, enigmatic 'satoshi' 
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:45:42
How much does 'satoshi' have?   Edit.   Also, satoshi is not a confirmed person.   Could be a group, nobody knows.   I mean a single person, with quarter of a million bitcoins, an early early adopter, and miner....who never sold and suddenly appears.
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:40:31
what is SB 2 and how will it address the transaction per second problem?
@_date: 2015-11-08 10:10:24
give 28 cents worth of bitcoin to ten friends who never used it before
@_date: 2015-11-09 10:15:02
crashed hard?  really?  up from a low of 200?  stop having the memory of an ant
@_date: 2015-11-17 15:39:59
sorry for the delay,  fee was about four cents.
@_date: 2015-11-18 08:11:18
how does shorting work.   ?  how can I short on exchanges?
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:56:05
That's very cool my friend
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:57:07
Happy cake day!  
@_date: 2015-11-16 23:16:55
thanks guys
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:55:28
That seems, even if true, ridiculous and meaningless.   Does that mean to say that 1/4 of all bitcoins in existence changed hands in a week in china?  What are they doing, playing pass around the circle?
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:14:57
These guys are the best.  From my bank to bitcoins in my wallet in ten minutes.  
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:21:40

Um, hotels in Europe usually require ID...which would be a deterrent.
@_date: 2015-10-27 12:04:33
Surfs up
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:32:33
I gotta bad feeling about this
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:40:58


   I had a question, but this quote from your webpage answered it.
@_date: 2015-11-01 11:26:51
Calm down buddy
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:57:32
@_date: 2015-10-23 12:03:09
That's amazing!
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:03:00
you're amazing.  you must be a really big fish, a high level day trader wheeling and dealing.  those two years where it steadily declined must've been hard for you.   stop having a hysteric fish-brain.   these aren't 'crashes'  they are fluxuations.
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:29:29
Can you make any future predictions of this?  For example I hear at present the blockchain is currently at a 40% avg transaction capacity, ie, other than simple buying and holding the system is not in any way able to be widely adopted for mass use, day to day affairs, mircopayments etc, though it will be, as a bank report recently described, a useful financial construct (in tandem with other constructs not a revolutionary replacement)
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:58:40
No,   'I miss you' means   I wish you were around more
     ' I missed you'   either I'm glad you are back, or 'I didn't connected with you'   similar to 'I missed your phonecall'      I hope that helps
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:49:27
pyramid schemes do not have any other ability except to move fiat up to a smaller group of owners.  Bitcoin has so many applications we cannot even imagine now it makes your comment sadly ignorant, at best.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:49:57
Any proof?   A fat wallet address?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:57:01
Howdy Sugarbits ;)
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:21:06
For example 2 per second would only allow 7200 transactions per hour globally and if there were more a longer and longer wait would develop.  Is this true?
@_date: 2015-11-20 10:37:12
that's very clear...thanks!!
