A one way ticket to wealth please 
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:41:10
Welcome! I feel like bitcoin is simply the tip of the iceberg. The key that unlocked the door to a wave of improvement to current technology 
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:36:51
awesome! Reminds me of futurama when they all plug themselves into a vr and enter the internet. Keep up the good work , man I wish I had a vr setup!

Buy the dip etf announcements in 5 days will create a trading frenzy
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:50:14
It will probably drop some 100 to 200. Perfect for people wanting to jump on before ETF jumps in
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:39:31
Most likely won't 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:11:45
Probably not, but if it does it's buy time hodlers

Late to the party �� we're going back down

@_date: 2017-03-16 12:54:16
Ethereum* and why would it dump , ignorance is a virtue 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:24:58
Gambling , but why the bear and the bull 
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:03:40
Seriously thanks for the sauce ! 
But this is hilarious ! Tossing a coin and drawing cards from a deck over such an important implementation! You've got to be kidding me , what about letting A.I make the decision? lol
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:23:57
coinbase? ��
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:21:49
Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:46:03
I don't know what's happening every crypto is going downwards. How low can you go��
But might it be? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:12:37
No , thank you! 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:43:56
You should sell , I'll give you a bag of doritos for your bitcoin

They were never cheap , they never will be 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:03:06
I either seeing it grow exponentially or slowly rises with more investors being drawn in on the long run. Time will tell but I think it's safe to assume bitcoin will reach 2k by the end of 2017 
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:42:45
Ah, those were the good ol' days !
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:15:56
A drop like this would certainly detour the etf proposal not help it 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:48:56
TIL , Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:48:05
Keep calm and HODL
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:34:34
My taughts exactly 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:13:02
Not arguing  with that logic , simply saying that prices are all relative.
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:41:25
All hail lord Alan Smithee , us Hodlers respect your decision!
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:42:09
Bitcoin can be worth a doritos chip or a ferrari is what we're saying
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:47:33
Alot of crypto's are being affected by drops right now!
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:06:23
They always did it big
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:20:21
Explain the image! HODL ARMY
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:10:57

@_date: 2017-03-07 14:43:27
Maybe bitcoin is a language created by machines ��
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:05:28
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:25:00

Of course 
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:05:20
You might be right ! 
But we shall never know
HODL warriors stay strong
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:33:30
I haven't heard any problems so far with ETF? And the BU issue will come to a solution eventually hardly believe it's a reason to let their bitcoins go
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:27:20
Really? Are they trying to drive the market down to rebuy? Or do they know something we don't ?
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:06:18
shouldn't I keep my btc on a non cold wallet to get the btu ? ...
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:06:01

@_date: 2017-01-10 19:57:54

@_date: 2017-01-09 06:06:18
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:21:15
listen you're complety right but i keep the vision simple of these two virtual goods. Eth is fuel and bitcoin is gold. how do you make money with both? pump fuel , hold gold . keep in touch if I spiked your interest. Long live bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:49:01
gouvernements like the US won't buy out bitcoin. For one where would you find such capital for investing? More debt? The fed won't accept such kind of spending to be honest. it's up to the people to value bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:09:10
why do you find this important to answer ? what's the correlation 
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:38:42
You can't associate their military losses with bitcoin lol ��, there is a reason why they "lost" excessive amounts like this. it's not bitcoin i'll let you guess again 
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:45:55
most accurate graph i've seen. To the ��!
