is there any chance people from Europe could see EUR prices instead of USD (e.g.based on IP)?
I am not used to dollar prices
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:35:04
you should have used 2-factor authorization... (e.g.Yubikey) I had to learn this the hard way, too...
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:10:14
great article, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:23:53
pls does anyone know where to find executed autoit scripts in windows logs? (if they are logged at all...)
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:22:30
fortunately not... or at least not yet :-) pls would you help me find out what needs to be checked? if there is any persistent action?
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:22:47
and another thing - while many people see bitcoin as a replacement for fiat I see it as a perfect complement. I prefer and most probably will prefer the fiat for petty daily transactions. I don't want to completely depend on electronics...ever

@_date: 2013-07-13 20:49:43
I don't quite understand this - if you had a 2FA with the original mtgox Yubikey then no one can get into your account - to remove the Yubikey authorization you need to use the it first successfully... are my assumptions wrong?
@_date: 2013-05-08 11:45:54
Will definitely look into it :-) thanks for the work

the BUG, TAiS46, the BUG - what about that topic???
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:53:46
on one hand it's good to have more people getting on but on the other hand when people who do NOT fully understand bitcoin start buying it because they see the price going up then there is always an inevitable ensuing crash afterwards...

yes, I do, but I also use hardware OTP key for mtgox... do you have any further information about this malware contents / actions?
btw who could be notified or asked for analysis? and who could block / investigate the bugslyfe reddit user?

this happens to me very often when I try to connect to some site without being authorized by the hotel proxy. Instead of the desired webpage the proxy page shows where I have to enter WiFi credentials and only after that I am redirected where I want.

nommi, YOU ARE my HERO!!! 
I am just going through the script, I will make it a bit more readable and repost it on pastebin and give you a link
pls one thing - for the future - how is it possible to safely download an applet from a web page and put it into a sandbox and decompile it? what tools did you use?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:37:03
... it's called mixing
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:38:16
pls could anyone analyze the malware in it? I was silly enough to go for it yesterday morning. Is there any permanent harm or did the applet execute a one-time action only?
btw I already reported the guy to reddit
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:44:44
what is that? link?
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:13:58
unfortunately I am a DB guy so php and Joomla are not really something I am familiar with... that's why I made the suggestion

Hey, dude. Don't give up. Check the password generation options in Keepass - based on it you can reasonably decrease the brute force efforts. Even if it takes a year to crack it's still worth the effort. SO START CRACKING THE PASS NOW!!! ;-)
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:32:46
yes, but the sad thing is that it's exactly those important areas (schools, healthcare, care for senior people, police...) that get cut as the first while using the saved money for NSA, bank bailouts, corruption...
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:17:08
The questions posed by the article are IMHO very valid and good. Every exchange is running a risk of getting 'goxed' so to speak :-)
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:04:08
Definitely would like to sign up and pay for a site such as  but on bitcoin
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:28:36
very good post - actually a Chinese friend (active in the political dissent) made an analysis for me. The situation is quite complex and different scenarios are possible. 
However, one thing is sure - China is NOT bitcoin-friendly but can tolerate it to some extent.

This is why I love reddit - even when the price is crashing - these redditors around always make laugh and help me keep the spirits up :-)

Just curious about the reaction of your parents when you told them :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:41:18
tharlam, pls would you update us on your situation? have your withdrawals been processed in the end? what does the mtgox support say?
EDIT: ah, ok, so you've got yours ( 
Anyway, I fully agree that there is no excuse for such delays. MtGoX just keeps messing things up for some time now...

I am sure that it might be a bit of design, coding, testing... but perhaps crowd-funding could solve the finances... 
(and definitely so when looking at the no of people hoarding their coins - if you want to see the bitcoin go up then consider contributing to such a project)

the coinchatbetta does not work... (the applet starts but does not do anything)
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:35:47
this thread is getting hot :-) ok, here's my bit. Even though I have a deep mistrust for the state, as long as we live as a society we just need some agreed-upon rules.
About money laundering - currently in connection with bitcoin it is used as sticker to deter people from it without having to resort to arguments (together with stickers child porn, drugs blablabla...)
I think it is the law of unintended consequences in our over-regulated society that just makes people sick of any rules in general (including me)
great that our caring governments are always so keen to elect new rules and trying to root out every evil while failing to address the evil and corruption among their peers

that's the FUCKER!!! pls inform privacyprotect.org &amp; spamhaus.org about this phishing site, also if you could help uncover the fucker who does it that will will be great
PS the exploit works as follows - the java applet runs an embedded autoit script the installs a rootkit with encryption and keylogging services, you can find my a partially deobfuscated code of the autoit script on the pastebin.com (it was put there by me) but I didn't have time to analyze / deobfuscate it completely

Hm, I think he is suggesting that there are many people with non-standard circuitry in their heads among bitcoiners - aaaand if that's so then he is obviously right because it takes a different approach to the world in order to lead the way into the 'hic sunt leones' area

could someone technical who is into the web development give me a couple of arguments how to convince a store about the ease of integration of bitcoin payments into their current infrastructure (java, python, php,...)?
how difficult is it to connect it to web ordering and billing functions?
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:12:39
in my view the required functionality entails providing / generating bitcoin addresses for payments and then checking which orders have been paid, which are still unpaid and automatically releasing / marking orders ready for shipment etc... it's about full automation of the order2cash cycle
@_date: 2013-07-06 06:23:43

vote up for privacy commitment and interesting service
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:19:21
I voted up. I like the summary. My view on the anonymity differs a bit, however. At the current stage of adoption I prefer to see the total anonymity rather as an option then a must. Let's be nice to the regulators until they make the fatal mistake of trying to outlaw bitcoin on basis of its current anonymity - and THEN we will have a perfect excuse for a hardwired total anonymity while all the blame will be on them (see the parable with filesharering going p2p)

nommi, I confirm to have been hacked, fortunately only 1.6BTC disappeared - I don't use mtgox primarily.
the perpetrator used following wallet and IP:






it is possible to decompile the autoit into source code
nommi or anyone else - would you provide me with the autoit you managed to rip out of the applet?
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:06:54
Hi Bean,
I would really like to help you, nonetheless, I am preparing myself for exams at my university...
one of the symptoms is an svchost.exe process which is NOT connected to the one in %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32 but elsewhere
well, it activates the keylogger for the first 6 user accounts
if you create and use a seventh user theoretically it could help
but if you don't want to wipe your operating system then AT LEAST return to the last system snapshot BEFORE you went for the java bait
if you wipe the system - it doesn't mean you will lose any user data, you just need to get rid of windows and its folders (backup all documents, songs, photos somewhere and reintall win from scratch)
