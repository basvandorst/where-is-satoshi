@_date: 2017-12-24 12:08:30
then why not use other alt coins such as IOTA, which has no transactions fee?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:57
lets be honest here, a large portion of the holders are here to flip profit by 25-100%+.
There not here to make purchases with BTC as cryptocurrency transactions are more expensive than fiat currency transactions.

There is already like 6 posts on this

everybody is holding, thus supply is low. Low supply = higher price.
but how long can anyone hold? eventually you will have to change back to fiat to spend and realize your gain.
When the correction happens. it will be big, at least 50% down

whenever coinbase goes down, there is significant price dip!  load up your ammo to catch the dips!!
