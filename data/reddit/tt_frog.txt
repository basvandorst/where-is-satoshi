If you had it before they pulled it out of the App Store you still have it. I use it every day.

Hey there friend! I would like to take you up on the offer.

So if another bitcoin user sends you money it should take around 10 mins?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:08:44
It's already lower than that now.

By selling the BTC on Coinbase for a profit and then just sending the money to a BTC-E address to deposit. Will that not work?
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:16:15
Oh, I agree. I didn't sell or anything. Was just watching the dip below a nice round threshold (400) and thought others might be interested.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:41:38
Well, there you go.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:45:44
It's a lot of fun.

I don't have BTC in BTCE but I have some at Coinbase that are up around 100%. Can't I just sell what I have at Coinbase, transfer that to BTCE, buy in, then turn around and sell it to Coinbase....over, and over again?
Am I missing something?

I know about arbitrage. Before fees that's a $42 gap per coin. I'm checking the math on all the fees now but it might still be a way to increase total coins owned (in addition to the arbitrage gains).

yes, if you haven't purchased yet you are SOL. If you actually made the purchase at $350 they will honor the price.

My mom runs a charity that feeds people in need all over the world, including places affected by hurricanes, etc. Each meal costs approximately $0.10. They've managed to  raise money to send a couple million meals over the last few years but are shut down this month due to lack of funding. She is not at all tech savvy and currently doesn't accept online donations at all. Anything sent will be given to her charity. This would be a huge way to help.

when you say compromised, does that mean it is now empty?

Still 0 users online. 0 games being played. lame.

I recently bought my first bitcoins. I feel like I can use a service like bitcoinget and use that for tipping. It's a win-win.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:47:15
Dat top comment tho. What an idiot.
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:35:20
Possibly. Where are you looking? Anywhere in the world? A particular country?
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:44:47
first payments came through as expected. Very cool!
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:28:04
I got out and ended up netting around a $20 gain (down from over $900 in the green). We'll see about buying back in.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:17:37
Dollar-cost averaging. Got it.

Have you considered adding eBay or other sites?
Does this work for any item on Amazon.com, including Marketplace products (from 3rd party sellers)?

It purchases a simplevoucher via Liqpay but I haven't received the SMS. Any ideas?
