We are currently flying people to Denver and Las Vegas from around the US for joint replacement surgeries. Using a model that does not involve insurance at all we have been able to make the procedures significantly cheaper at these particular facilities even after we cover all travel expenses. 
When's surgery costs $50k at most hospitals but can be done without insurance for $16k at a transparent pricing facility a $500 flight and $300 hotel don't really even make a dent in the savings.

It's been regulated to death and all power has been given to the insurance companies.

You joke about this but the private healthcare industry has been making huge pushes for transparent prices and consumer driven healthcare consumption. Private healthcare thinks it will be best for everyone if you can shop for your MRI or surgery the same way you shop for flights. You compare all of your different options and then go to the one that fits your needs best. Obviously this won't work for ER visits but everything else it should.

Im a fan of dropping all health insurance except for catastrophic insurance which basically is an extremely low premium insurance that is only in place to prevent you from going bankrupt due to treatment or surgery such as a massive heart surgery that actually does cost $200k.
If we let the free market decide the rest of healthcare we will see similar results that Mexico sees right now. In Mexico there is very little health insurance offered and what is offered is typically catastrophic coverage only. Instead the free market has control and you pay out of pocket for everything. Your primary care visits are $20 compared to the $120 average cost in the US AFTER insurance. Ibuprofen in a Mexico hospital is $0.05 a pill as it should be. Not $45 a pill like it is in the US. When you dont have insurance making deals with every other healthcare provider for discounted rates prices seem to be a lot more realistic and affordable. 
My solution does not help the homeless and impoverished which is my only hang up to this method.  If that issue could be solved I think this method will provide the best and least expensive healthcare without inhibiting innovations like a single payor system tends to.
