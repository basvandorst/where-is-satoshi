Moore's law is not a real law of physics is an observation of tech for very very short time in human history. A financial systems Tech should not be extrapolated based on. 
However I still agree with you, I think if we are in need of a block that size, I suspect our miners will be able to accommodate it by that point in time.

Satoshi did not write the majority of the code. he wrote the write paper which the code was based on. the code was written by humans. Humans are prone to error. its foolish to think that bitcoin would be perfect on the first version of the release. I am personally amazed that the code is as good as it is.

I agree with this comment. You are correct about the security. I also agree it will help scaling solutions in the future. But small increase in payload of 2-4mb is not a scaling solution in itself as its unrelated to adoption/demand or any kind of growth past 2016.

It does not in anyway handle the growth of the network. It gives a little more room only on transactions that take advantage of it. But by no means yielding more room in relation to increase usage. This little bit of wiggle room only buys a few extra months because it does not meet the increase needed

A hard fork is required to get us out of this artificial hole we are in. Preferably we want to do it with one hard fork not many. 
A soft solution has not even been proposed let alone hope of being completed in time. We only have a few months left at best before a cascade failure happens when adoption cam not physically increase.

Scaling* implies accommodating the growth of the network. 
Hence "scale with size"
This only allows slightly more room in a still very small block that well not accommodate the growth of the network

Only 8 gigs if a miner chooses to do that(assuming there was enough transactions to even make the block in first place), they are not forced to produce a block they came till throttle it down to 756k like many currently are.  And that still would be many years into the future. 
The other part of your statement I do however agree with, I think. A core develop should be nowhere near even a perceived conflict of interest real otherwise. 
I'm not totally sold on sabotage theory, but plenty of actions made by many parties are with out a doubt outside ethics. The only solution to at least keep of the appearance of impartiality which no one is even trying to do.(if they are, they are doing a bad job at that)

Um... Segwit is many good things. But under no circumstances is it a scaling* solution. Scaling implies it allow block size to grow with demand. Claim to such is a distraction from a real solution.

A thing to consider from a business prospective is you need to look at alternative sources exchanging BTC.
Coinbase is the  place I send average joe to test out bitcoin. Its pretty darn straight forward and they are a great company to work with. Absolutely no complaints from me.
however experience has shown as a payment processor on merchant end Bitpay is superior. And further would be easier set the api to 0 confirmations to stream line/speed up the donation (double-spending on a donation is ludicrous as no goods are in direct exchange)
I see it as the cheapest most friction-less way to pave between donors and Wikimedia.
I know that some may disagree with me on this. but i think it is at least worth considering, and discussed by the community.

I'm not keen on it being tied to any kind of mining but rather directly to qty of bandwidth provided to the network.. which means if they essentially collected a "toll" on each packet(putting those to front of line) they may not need manufacture a whole new alt crypto. might be even able to make something that is backwards compatible to the existing tor network.
the following is one of many ways it could* work
notation: in this example there is no guarantee the node provides the priority paid for the voluntary fee. however you can only collect the toll if you run a exit node software.
Nodes don't have to prioritize but it if they don't clients don't have an incentive to volunteer it. hence the toll would reach an equilibrium based on the market. 
sudo code:
[on exit node]
if package_has_toll_key then 
if toll.value &gt; 1
move toll.value to node_wallet
for 1hour
 recipient_has_priority=toll.value
[on tor client]
on _create_packet
print toll_key _copy
(if the packet went out on a node that doesnt collect the toll no need to let it go to waste)
wait 1 hour
if toll.value &gt; 1
move toll.value back to personal_wallet

Dear Dana,
I know that others are probably upset and you might be getting a barrage of emails. However let me contribute my thoughts as a NY constituent. I recently started a company in a niche bitcoin commodity market. Its a small business but we are growing, only about 12 of us. I pay salaries in the range of 100-200k. I expect to employ over 100 people by this time next year.
The problem is I have no room for error misconduct or knee jerk reactions from a state government as we are in critical phase of our development. Since my close proximity to the border I simply choose the safest option for the sake of myself and my employees. We physically moved out of New York. We are nimble enough that the move was easy. 
Our lives are a little less stress full here in Massachusetts.  
If there is any advise you need from a business owner let me know.

The fiat side is the problem. however the closest thing you can get to this is using the open transaction system. which the exchanges will rush to the moment gox kicks the bucket.  though since they are offshore. theoretically their site could  continue to function in the state for some times.

people die, or private keys are lost, or even just discarded all of which can never be recovered.
the rate of creating bitcoins is also decreasing. It was designed to be inflationary in the beginning to give incentive early adopters to secure the system by building more miners and contributing to the infrastructure. as time passes this rate of creation drops while the rate of coins dropped from circulation will eventually meet if it has not already.

I brought a rather hot girl home this weekend who contacted me on okcupid. Things were going well. She seemed really kinky and also into me. As things were heating up and we were in the middle of making out. she says "if you want to go any further and have sex it will cost you 50$ for as long as i want me" she has a capitalistic kink because she thinks its evil and thus sorta taboo. Being a true believer in Bitcoin and not having any USD cash I start looking around the room frantically for loose change. I'm coming up massively short.

a better method would be to use the standard deviation formula to calculate expected peak bandwidth to within reason. This is used by factories all over the world when dealing with production bandwidth to spot anomalies.

i would agree to 95% if we had better mechanisms of miner decentralization. Decentralization meaning a miner has no more than 1% of the hash power.
75% is a good compromise for now.
i think innovations in the future will allow for more decentralization.
At that time 95% is more sellable to me.
However since in the future decentralization can breakdown into centralization again like we have today i would say.  This could be 400years into the future
75% is a good compromise to keep for the future to protect us during times of centralization.

Then it looks like you have made an informed decision.
I'm gonna give you an upvote, even though I have a different opinion on the decision.
I would never keep money in a Bank these days, I don't believe in usury so I also keep the bank away from my house.  Those are philosophical and opinion based decisions. 
I very much agree on the stance of you making an informed consent position.
What is not an opinion is simply any crypto not in your possession is not your crypto, plain and simple.  Something the majority of people fail to understand.  A study was done by several exchanges in the early days where did liability studies and found only 10% of the users understood this.  This opens up the market for huge potential of loss be it switching to fractional reserve, theft, or data loss.

I would love to see to edit this down. I see a ton of repetition in them.
example:devil in democracy between 6:00-7:00
actually there is a lot of repetition in all of  it.
These Videos are close to twice the size they need to be and seem to move at a slow pace compared to your other videos.
If you can concentrate them down to a similar punch packing content as the other videos I will share the hell out of the edited videos.
I will meeting with some community organizers shortly and doing some talks about representation bitcoin as well as some specific local issues. I would love to have shorter materials to distribute there as well.

Im sorry to hear you don't yet own any cyrpto-currancy. 
Not your keys, not your bitcoin. This is not a metaphor, this is reality.
When you do own some crypto, treat it like any other valuable and store it in a safe or behind a family portrait. It's not rocket surgery. 
I have been in this space a long time. I have seen many exchanges fail (some not even any fault of their own, government seizure etc..). I have been around through the suicides and people thrown out of windows.  But also the minor things like people suffering mild depression.
Do yourself a favor and learn from people who came before you.

actually the special interests are controlling this subedit.  the fork is to address a problem that was intended to be fixed that was put off. the 1mb limit was artificially introduced a few years ago and was never intended to be permanent. The time to remove it is approaching because soon full blocks will become a regular thing. however there are interests that wish to be off chain brokers of btc that will benefit by the issue not being fixed.
XT includes a compromise of 8mb since the problem entities really don't want to budge at all. It was hopped the core team would release a better fix in response. however their interests are obviously not in fixing the underlying issue at all.
So we are full speed ahead for the xt fork. even though talk about xt is highly taboo (on this specific subreddit)

1. mining is the system in which bitcoin audits the books so to speak. as a reward for people keeping the books there is a lottery system to reward them. this happens approx every 10 minutes, at which point the  public ledger advances by 1 block (a the group of entries that the miners confirmed) certain mathematical conditions have to be met (a mathematical proof) to prove the work they did is valid. which in turn is propagated out and checked by the others. in the event of a tie or dispute additional blocks are checked globally until the dispute or tie is settled. the democratically elected solution is added and the faulty block is discarded (aka orphaned block) 
2. bitcoins are units in a ledger(blockchain). the miners prevent alteration as the sum of all bitcoins is a fixed number (21million)
a person is completely free to write their own ledger. Some even have however those coins are not in the bitcoin ledger system and thus do not benefit from the established security, value or market capitalization of bitcoin. Because it is a free market if you create a superior coin in theory it could be adopted however its hard to outpace all the benefits bitcoin already has and evolved. 
3. the coins already exist based on a mathematical formula.
think 2+2 always equals 4 (simplistic terms). since its based on math it cant be tampered with
they are put into circulation via the miners as they all follow the same formula. currently that rate is 25 every ten minutes decreasing by 1/2 every 4 years over time until all 21 million are in circulation. If a miner tries to run a different formula such as to give them self more then the agreed amount its mathematical proof will not add up correctly and will be discarded by the network.

Validation is only one half of the issue. You need a complex hash to create them.  It needs to be complex to prevent tampering. Sometimes its only a few seconds between blocks and sometimes longer. In the end difficulty adjusts to make sure the average is about ten minutes.
Litecoin uses smaller intervals and came out of the argument that 10 was too long. However the hashing power behind bitcoin made bitcoin more appealing.
The idea is not to make creation of blocks easy. It needs to be hard on purpose.

addressing your point 1 sorting creates incentive for off chain transactions, and rent seekign behavior on the blockchain.
point 2 
confirmaiton time link is not broken. only in situations when under ddos. and in which case the ddos itself effects confirmation time. randomly dropping defuses the situation by sacrificing only a little bit of the average of confirmation time at those times where it would be much worse.
I would like to point out this doesnt fork the chain and if only some of the miners/nodes use this it will make a huge difference in getting real transactions through the noise of spam. With the added benefit of this process/algorithm being further improved alone perhaps even using a non random method in the future. This doesn't fork the chain.
if only 20% of the nodes us this vs no change. it should improve the throughput of real transactions during a ddos between 1-20%.

I am now holding off donating a dime to any charity until I set this up and dedicating my resources to that. If i can help future donations from other people then that will out weigh the social good my own individual donations could ever do.

this has less to do with volatility and more to the fact that there is a buy wall that is massively pegging it to 114.... for a duration of time that is insane since 5:10am EST until now and still going.

cyprus needs the following things to help early adoption.
a boat or small shipping company willing to accept Bitcoin.
then all you need is one farmer willing to export goods in Bitcoin.
honey is a good example.
next is laborers willing to accept it.
with the cooperation of only one farmer I bet you could draft a group of kids out of school willing to try-it out as an experiment, were they do manual labor for a month for only Bitcoin for said farmer.
perhaps offer up a prize, and make a competition out of it somehow.
in fact offer up a small prize for a person or group who drafts "the most creative use for virtual currency" and applies it.   such as trying to live 100% on just bitcoin and barter for a set amount of days.

I really don't like granting the use of my computers power to a central person or corporation to control. sure the source code could be examined to be sure my personal files are not effected. however i'm not so keen on handing over this valuable resource to say the US government. so they can run decryption software via a mega super computer.
the miners are benign and add no other value. that in itself is a form of protection of the economy from other self serving interests that would use the power for good or evil. right now its used for self sustaining.

Your assumption is based on everyone in china selling. i do not think it would create a larger surplus then when this started as many will still be holding and many were lost (deaths, lost hard drives etc...)

I agree this is the most likely scenario. this wall seems to want to fluctuate below it for hours Its not letting them. This invis-a-wall is costing someone a lot of money.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:29:41
even better idea....What about pegging the USD to bitcoin
@_date: 2013-05-16 12:39:48
are you claiming the economy is currently artificial intelligence.. and not organic :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:24:28
tell them sorry your money is all tied up in bitcoin. regardless of what you feel is money. its more about what they believe is money.
