I still think my point is valid -- open source software can be modified and forked, and the derivative coin thereby diminishes/dilutes some of the market opportunity that was initially available to the original coin.  I'm defining scarcity broadly.  You may be defining scarcity more literally -- eg only wrt BTC.
You seem to agree with me when you say "they can steal some of bitcoin's market share".  That was the point of my original post.

What if a corporation with, say, 2 billion users, a half a trillion in market cap, $45B in cash and a host of corporate partners actively promoted one of these monopoly dollar alternatives?
I'm not bullish on Libra, I'm just saying that crypto adoption is still in its infancy and BTC's long-term success is by no means assured.  There is a non-zero chance that a coin(s) other than BTC is the ultimate winner(s).

i'm making the argument that open source software is relatively easy to copy and modify -- unlike building a structure.
But to use your analogy, a single mansion can be valuable, but any one mansion is relatively less valuable when there are many mansions.  Any moron can understand that.

Actually, this has already happened in the real world.
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:05:25
It can, and has been, forked which greatly undermines the whole scarcity argument.

That's fair.
My opinion, fwiw, is that BTC's strengths are also potential weaknesses, and over time the market will reward multiple crypto solutions where each one is a better technical fit for its particular use case.
BTC has an enormous lead in "store of value".  That lead will only grow near-term as more "institutional investor plumbing" (eg Bakkt, ETFs) gets built out....but I'm not convinced this plumbing will create permanent barriers to entry vs other coins.  Regulators have generally treated BTC in a benign way because the blockchain is public, so payments that are deemed illegal can still be traced (eg Ross Ulbricht) and fiat gateways, like Coinbase, can be forced to cooperate.  On a retail level, however, I think BTC could be vulnerable in store-of-value to one of its more private forks -- especially in parts of the world where the political &amp; regulatory environment is more difficult.  A POS variant would also have certain store-of-value advantages from a lending/borrowing perspective, so over time BTC may be vulnerable in store-of-value to one of those variants.
I don't think BTC will ever enjoy large scale adoption as a payment or micro-payment currency -- it simply isn't architected for speed &amp; low cost...and LN can't make up for those shortcomings in a practical way vs other alternatives.  I think a stable coin with broad corporate sponsorship could easily get ahead of BTC for many forms of transactions.  A coin like LBR might have fit this bill, but I think the sponsorship by FB will bring too much regulatory &amp; market resistance.  Perhaps GOOG, AMZN, AAPL or DIS (or a subset of these) will step forward with a broadly supported payment solution if LBR fails.

LOL.  Thanks for the offer, but I'm done.  You've done a good job, thieflar, running the maximalist playbook:
* Do not acknowledge that other coins may have merit.  "There is one true crypto, and only one true crypto.  All other cryptos are false cryptos, and any past or future forks of BTC are not dilutive to BTC's scarcity, but are simply 'dividends" from the benevolent BTC"
* Do not debate BTC's technical merits or demonstrable shortcomings; rather, question the questioner's technical understanding.  "It's not your fault, you simply don't understand"

Send me links to the support you reference above.  I'll read it.  I was pretty clear about my specific issues with BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:53:37
Ok, thanks for the links.  I will give them a look.

Hmmmmm...so in other words, I should take your word for it -- and the word of the esteemed BTC authorities mentioned above.
Here's what I struggle with: other coins are more extensible and offer more features, some are more private, some have faster TPS and confirmation speeds, and many require less energy.  BTC coins are scarce in the context of BTC, but not in the context of more forks or in the context of other coins.
Without a doubt, BTC has certain advantages: it currently has more financial infrastructure, and that lead will continue for a while (futures markets, Bakkt, etc).  It also has more market cap and more mindshare.  But those advantages aren't necessarily permanent.  If fact, I think they are temporary.  A better coin will replace it along all of those dimensions.
In addition, I think LN is a joke -- there's no way a sufficient number of people will sponsor their own nodes, and then stake them.  Betting on LN design is like betting on PHEVs.
So, given all of this, MY personal assessment of the BTC is that the Netscape of the crypto world.  A decade from now it will be a footnote...an important footnote, but a footnote nevertheless.

How can you say this with so much confidence considering how many other coins are forks from the original bitcoin code (which is open source, btw)
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:40:21
Thanks.  I appreciate the thoughtful response.  I don't expect you to change your mind -- but will write this so you'll know a bit more about my perspective.
I bought my first BTC in 2015, so I've been thinking about crypto for some time and have been actively looking for the next project(s) that might break-out like BTC did.  I have done a fair amount of research, but tend to stop reading about a particular coin once I run into an aspect I don't like.
I really liked BTC at first, but soured on it in 2017 after seeing the forking -- that really undermined the scarcity argument for me.  I believe BTC will get at least one more bounce if Bakkt and Gemini can get some institutional investors to put money to work this year, but I don't believe BTC will ever become a real reserve currency or meaningful store of value long-term -- again, because it's too easy to fork.  (Btw, I've never come across a maximalist who acknowledges this critical risk to BTC.  To them, every other coin is inferior and there will only be one BTC)
I also have problems with BTC's technology.  I used the PHEV/ICE car analogy above on purpose.  To me, attaching LN to BTC is like bolting a fast, cost-efficient technology onto a slow, expensive platform.  The resulting product is inherently compromised.  BTC/LN is the PHEV of crypto, and some day soon you won't be able to buy a new PHEV car.  Nano is functionally [superior]( to LN -- and Nano works now.  To me, Nano therefore has a better chance of long-term success.
I can't think of a single industry (aviation, auto, healthcare, etc) where an inferior product defeated a superior product...except perhaps VHS vs betamax...so this is another reason I won't be buying back into BTC.
I'm not sure which crypto(s) will ultimately succeed, and whether it even exists yet -- but that's what I'm trying to figure out.  I suspect that it will be a coin that can really scale and has low cost.  It will be used for tipping on multiple platforms and as a means for paying for things on-line.  It will be available on mobile payment apps such as ApplePay, AmazonPay, CashApp, Venmo, etc.  It will be popular globally as a means of transacting, and it will not be a stable coin.
This coin won't be a privacy coin like Monero...the authorities have shown that they will tolerate traceable coins like BTC, but they won't stand for currencies that can avoid detection.  And for this reason, I'm less concerned about decentralization -- easy on- and off-ramps to fiat will be important.  Therefore, I believe that a certain level of corporate "endorsement" is necessary.  While it won't be backed by a particular company, it may be a coin that is supported by numerous tech company platforms and by large banks, and those associations will provide this coin with the ability to reach a lot of consumers quickly and benefit from the association with brands they trust.  (I know, I know this is anathema to many crypto true-believers, but my perspective is more commercial/practical than idealistic/philosophical).
So, there you have it.  Apparently we're looking for different things -- with opposite views on the likelihood of our respective coin's success.

1) I said: "other coins are more extensible and offer more features, some are more private, some have faster TPS and confirmation speeds, and many require less energy"
You responded with: "Right, you can go through and list the specific individual trade-offs that any given coin made relative to Bitcoin (and in fact I'm telling you outright that I've personally done so), but as you've correctly observed, digital scarcity can potentially be strongly assured with **Bitcoin** but not **cryptocurrency",** which doesn't address any of my technical points.  If you know of any articles that state why an investor shouldn't be concerned with BTC's slower speed, inferior feature set, and higher energy consumption, I'd like to read them.
2) I said that BTC isn't scarce in the context of cryptocurrency
You responded with: "digital scarcity can potentially be strongly assured with **Bitcoin** but not **cryptocurrency".**  I think you're agreeing with me, but I can't be sure.  If you're agreeing with me, then why would BTC be worth more than any other coin from a scarcity perspective.  If you can say more about this, I'm listening.  Btw, i don't buy the argument that "Bitcoin hasn't split, and its scarcity has remained sacrosanct" -- a software engineer *might* agree with this, but an economist would say that that's just semantics.  Again, if you have any articles on this point, i will read them.
3) I said: "LN is a joke" and then I posted a table that compares LN to Nano
You said: "literally every row beneath the top two is false and apparently created with the deliberate intent to mislead and deceive. It serves as a great example of the sort of misinformation that I am referring to; with about twenty minutes of effort, research, and thought, you can debunk the entire thing"  So please send me the link that will allow me to do exactly this research
