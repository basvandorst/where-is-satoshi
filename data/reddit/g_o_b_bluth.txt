A good start would be getting rid of the world's  polluter, the US government.

Admit it, you wanted to drive a cool car, have people look at your license plate, and have people look at your post on Reddit. Admit it!!!
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:10:24
There's never a good time to beg your masters.

Ahh nm. Mixing up notations.
For anyone else's reference: 5,000 (base 12) == 10,368 (base 10) using "10" and "11" as we use in base 10 rather than something else like "A" or "B".
@_date: 2014-11-12 20:14:27
Wouldn't it be more like 2A88?

The IRS estimates 15.5% of people are not complying with tax laws yet last year, .0022% of people, or 2,000 people, were convicted for tax crimes.

This is my  question. If this is akin to a savings account, then they'll be spending your money and just promising you can have it back. If its literally just a cold storage solution, surely they'll have to charge money to keep the thing secure.

Paypal is propped up by a high barrier to entry into the electronic payments market. Its virtually impossible to compete and take some of paypal's market share due to government intervention.
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:27:05
Sorry. I hoped my sarcasm would come through. I really dig the car and I'm super down with your choices for spreading bitcoin love.
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:35:51
I'm interested. I can't pm from my phone.

He gave you the political answer, not the economic one.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:45:34
Of course. He was asking how to dodge the tax.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:49:11
Buy physical bullion and store it in a safe. Sell it off or trade it for cash as needed.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:25:41
I think the best option would be to purchase things. If you can't spend $50k at once, then buy some physical gold or silver bullion and sell that for cash as you need it.
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:55:28
Post updates on reddit if you would. I'm in the bay area and would love to donate time and money to something like this.

TIL bitcoin miners aren't actually hitting rocks with pickaxes to get bitcoins out of them.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:55:34
I'm in the same boat. Just forget the idea that you're going to get a 100x return on your investment in 2 years. The time for that is over. You can still be smarter than all the newbies who learn about bitcoin, get sticker shock, then never look further though. Those people will be kicking themselves when bitcoin is at $1,000 and they could've tripled their returns.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:28:56
What's wrong with gox or campbx? Are you looking specifically to purchase from a US based exchange?
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:01:13
That dude was scared of a big player manipulating the market to get a free month of reddit gold?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:09:15
A good entry point is buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:05:57
And the people who are willing to spend a day or two getting things verified will profit as you watch the ticker rise from the sidelines!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:08:49
They're actually coinbasecoins, not bitcoins. You have to spend them in the coinbase store.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:11:23
I considered the alternatives but went with the third option... not voting.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:07:25
But it can move hearts.

TO THE MUTHAFUCKING MOON
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:13:06
I've been buying on coinbase for the last two days.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:45:15
The kicker is that it shouldn't be illegal. Yeah, if you sign a contract with the company, then that contract should be enforced but why should the very people who know markets best be barred from investing in those markets? I suppose it would be preferable if we all knew absolutely nothing about the markets we invest in, that way we'd be throwing our money into the ring like we bet on craps.
@_date: 2013-10-16 23:51:30
Its arguably easier to find dealers on craigslist who will accept cash. Getting your cash into bitcoin is a pain.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:08:06
Yes. We need pieces of paper to protect us from the boogie man. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:51:28
My  rule of precious metals is "if you don't hold it, you don't own it". Yes, its strange that its not widely discussed but you should have personal ownership of any commodity you value if you want to feel secure. Even moreso with something new and relatively less tested like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-23 02:35:10
Any reason why I should use coinbase over campBX? I keep hearing bad things on this sub.
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:04:25
Good question. I'm sure there's a section of the tax code deep in the books that says if you get anything of value digitally that you owe the government some of it. Just like there are laws buried deep in the books that you and I break all the time simply out of ignorance. 
I imagine they'd love it if you treated it just like their fiat currency and reported all of that income as independently earned. I say the burden is on them.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:41:53
I effing love ounce.me. Its on my homescreen. If there was an android app, I'd download it in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:11:03
Its money. Earn it by working for someone who is willing to trade bitcoins or purchase them from someone who is willing to trade them for fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:23:28
Because of course its possible to create your own bitcoin client. The condescension is necessary to prevent future unnecessary posts from being submitted to this sub.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:29:00
That's a good example. You don't really own your console. Notice how consoles have to be jailbroken? Notice how the xbox is basically one giant Microsoft and mountain dew advertisement? If you want control in both cases, you use a PC and an android device. If you think there's nothing wrong with how the controlling organization runs things, then by all means, buy their products... its great competition. Otherwise, buy a machine that you own 100% and nobody has control over.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:37:15
You heard it here first, people. Bitcoin tipping is literally killing bitcoin.
Btw... there's a high demand for witty commentry on reddit so I'd argue it was not a zero-sum transaction.
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:34:47
What's your workflow if you don't mind me asking? Like, is there any way to make it quicker to "money-in-hand" than a bank wire?

Hey, while you're in your time machine, can you go back and kill Hitler?

Don't pretend like you almost made a million dollars. You probably would've cashed out when it doubled at $20. You'd have to be a die hard to hold onto it this long and even then, you'd still be holding, not selling off for fiat.
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:13:03
The government lays claim to your money and resources because you were born on land they lay claim to. If you feel their claim is legitimate, then by all means, do the research and find out just how much money uncle Sam deserves. Personally, I think the entire establishment is immoral so I pay out the minimum required to keep their goons in costumes from beating my door down. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:10:04
There's people who think the government is doing great work. Then there's people who think the government is temporarily doing less than great work. Then there's people who see things as they are.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:01:30
This is exactly why its damn near impossible to purchase btc with a credit card. Too much risk.
