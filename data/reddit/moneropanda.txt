UBI could work even with limited supply currency if the nation is not constantly piling up debt.
In more advanced countries like Germany, switzerland or sweden, UBI is de facto already there (as in you get about 1k$ per month from the age of 18 if you can’t find suitable work).
A real UBI, where everyone unconditionally gets an income is also in discussion there, even though parties favouring it have less than 2% of votes. 
IMO, UBI boosts creativity, which is a good thing in a more and more robotized/automated industry.

This guy promoting total control of the state creeps me out. The logic behind Bitcoin is to move the control of money out of peoples hands, because not once in history has this worked out. And also it’s logic is to be able to spend money internationally. It would make more sense if several states s.a. The US, Canada and Eurozone would team up for a digital currency than making a USD coin. But then again why not just use currently available coins?
Also note that, the Federal Reserve stopped publicizing the money supply long ago, which means if they want a digital dollar, they would want to invent some sort of e-coin that doesn’t show the total supply while it still is totally traceable for them to be able to seize and watch over all of their users assets at any time.
And for that reason, I am out.

Bitcoin is being traded 24/7
This is mainly because bitcoin is a very global market. If bitcoin were only of interest in a certain time zone like Europe, for example, you would see close to no change in its price during the night or weekends (in Europe), due to the fact that most of the $$ volume added to bitcoin‘s market cap enters or exits through the banking system. (Bitcoins market cap defines the price through this formular: Market Cap/Number of bitcoins=BTC Price)
Interestingly we see the biggest market movements in BTC during the time of 8:00 PM ET onwards, because that’s when markets in Asia open (Equals 8:00 AM Hong Kong Time).
Hope this was informative.

On localbitcoins you pay the seller usually 0.5-5%, while the sender usually pays the transaction fee. When I buy bitcoins in Europe this way, I usually end up with about 95$ in btc when I give him 100$.

Well. Keep in mind that in any 18 month period invested in BTC you have made a profit. If this trend continues we should be over 20k again by the end of 2019.

Bitcoin Miners get passive income, they have to invest time and money to secure the network. It is a form of staking considering all the capital tied up in equipment. The massive hashing power as a result makes the Bitcoin network basically incorruptible. 
All PoS concepts where staking is an option are just simulating the economic game of Bitcoin. We will see if that works out.

Let me check the definition of ‘fiat money’ aha..
What is 'Fiat Money'
Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material from which the money is made.

If you look at fiat money, you see they fluctuate about 10-30% per year against each other. I believe this is best we will get for bitcoin as well once the market cap reaches a certain level.

1. talk about what fiat money is and how it became that way, how many times in history it failed due to the nature of centralized money systems.
2. say that for a hundreds, maybe thousands of years people discussed how a substantiated money system that is controlled by no one, but can be used by everyone could be brought to life. 
But without the internet, such thing was impossible to do.
3. Once the internet became available to everyone, one very smart guy put this desire of society into a working product and labeled it Bitcoin in 2009
4. Today, bitcoin and it’s price represent general interest in it

Somewhere before the year 2000, Hussein intended to start accepting other currencies for its oil exports besides the USD. Bush had to prevent this, to maintain the Dollar’s power as the global reserve currency, as other countries where likely to follow Iraq‘s move.
Some people believe the 9/11 attack was an inside job, to give the US a legitimate reason to invade Iraq, especially since the plan to invade Iraq, Lybia, Syria, etc. were made even years before the attacks. IMO this is bullshit as the U.S could have easily done so without harming its people.
Anyway, as other comments said, if there was solely a global decentralized currency, no country could afford growing their debts like all countries do right now, much less be able to maintain a military invasion of any kind because war is super expensive.

Let’s assume you bought at 6000$ per btc.
You have paid 110$ together and now have 0.018000 btc (approx)
Friend X: (20/110)*0.018= 0.03272 btc
Friend Y: (40/110)*0.018= 0.06545 btc
Friend Z: (50/110)*0.018= 0.00818btc
For “0.018” you can put in whatever amount of btc you actually have in total.
