@_date: 2017-12-10 01:41:54

I invested 800 mxn pesos and it's at 1130 nice. Not a lot by any means, but still.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:51:53
Someone who didn't buy it when it was cents in value. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:17:55

This is reddit, where the entire page basically revolves around the comment section though?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:53:06
Damn in mexico if you use bitso it takes like 5-10 minutes to get your bitcoin after you purchased. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:33:20
When it hits 50k you'll regret not doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:34:25
How much is  a mBTC to BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:29

B O I
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:55:36
The barrier has been broken. Watch bitcoin drop to 5k and then rise up like crazy. Afterwards people complaining about not buying.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:12:07
Just saying. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:57:13

@_date: 2018-07-25 00:20:27
