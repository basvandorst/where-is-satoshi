Luckily I didn't go all fiat... I still have a decent amount in cold storage.  I really did think it was continuing down into the $300's...

Sweet, that was really awesome. Bought a garmin nuvi gps with Bitcoin from Overstock.com Beep and that was it. Magic Internet Money! The future is here!
@_date: 2014-05-03 04:52:10
It'd be a hell of a lot easier if amazon just accepted BTC...
@_date: 2014-01-12 10:00:30
Very cool

He wanted to list on eBay, and they don't allow BTC payments. Yet.

Reading the double capitals in BitCoin hurts my brain.

It's happening!

Will you continue to make/sell the previous year's coin? What is the total mintage for the 2014 going to be?

I too would like to thank reddit for introducing me to Bitcoin and ultimately allowing me to be currently debt-free. I sound like an infomercial but frig man, seriously thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:30:21
Awesome, just bought it!
@_date: 2014-09-08 09:49:12
I actually first heard about it back in June 2012 on the r/silverbugs subreddit. I was beginning to get into collecting silver and a few people over there mentioned it. I couldn't open an account on Gox r whatever reason (luckily), so I opened a coinbase account and bought 2 BTC for about $120. I used it on dice sites and won some,  lost some... Then the price skyrocketed in November and I've been continuing to buy steadily ever since. No regrets!
@_date: 2014-04-01 08:49:53
Yeah because I sold an hour before it started going up...
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:31:53
Notice how they conveniently didn't mention the credit card fees.
@_date: 2014-09-08 21:45:42
It's time. I'm officially bullish.

If you don't hold it, you don't own it.  Keep physical silver and gold, it's all about the shinies!

The beep is great.

Although this is incredibly bullish news and it would almost seem that "investing your life savings into Bitcoin" is beginning to look like a good idea..PLEASE DONT!  Only put into it what you can afford to lose!  I am very bullish but only started with a little over 10% of my savings in Bitcoin which have since quadrupled. I don't lose sleep or stress about it and even if it crashes for whatever reason it won't be life changing.
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:42:57
I bought 10BTC when it was at $650..thinking that was the bottom. It dropped, I held, and I'm still not worried :)
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:11:03
I bought almost all Christmas gifts (this past year) from Amazon using Gyft.com bitcoin bought gift cards, then replaced the spent BTC.  I am in the process of getting a loan for a house and I will be using up most of my BTC to pay for the closing costs in full AND going to put 30% down. After that, I'll be out of BTC but at least I have a $20 daily recurring buy from coinbase going.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:14:46
It's a gamble really, will someone develop an easy to use and completely secure way to store and also use bitcoin? If this happens...well, let's just say to the moon guy will have sore fingers.
@_date: 2014-09-11 09:06:20
Having them get a wallet on their phone on the spot might be the way to go. That way they can start playing with bitcoin right away. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:45:40
Discount code BTC10 not valid??
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:12:37
So why isn't the price spiking yet? The holiday I guess?

This is a crazy good idea. I am signing the petition
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:55:02
I have no idea either, but with wider acceptance and adoption it's got to be a good thing for the price eventually... so I'll just hold onto the few BTC I currently have and wait it out.

@_date: 2015-01-06 08:34:07
i'd have to say that the price will increase in value due to the negative news. In 2014 we saw all types of good news and the price continued to decline..

Just use Circle or Coinbase to buy some bitcoin. Once purchased, send it to a wallet (download a wallet app) and then play around with small amounts of bitcoin, sending it to and from your wallet addresses. Once you get the hang of moving bitcoin around easily, learn how to make a paper wallet and then just store your bitcoin there if that's your plan. I keep the vast majority of my bitcoin on paper wallets (in safety deposit box at the bank) and a smaller amount in my blockchain.io wallet, and my breadwallet for spending. After doing some research you can then get into exchanges they are a little more complicated.

What do you use to go so far? Buy a rocket and detonate after catching a glider??

Yes I just updated the iPhone app, now say balance 0 BTC for all addresses including paper wallets. Must be some sort of app error.
@_date: 2015-08-24 13:49:32
I use the blockchain.info app and have some BTC I use for spending on an address. I also have a paper wallet at home. Can I move BTC from my spend address to the paper wallet safely? Probably a simple answer and thanks in advance.
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:29:32
Should be a good run up from here..I've been spending sub $250 and not replenishing LOL :(

Same thing happened to me while on vacation at the beach in Florida last month. All along the coastline from Madeira Beach and South are Tons of "Bitcoin accepted here" businesses according to Coinmap. So of course I talk my girlfriend into going to all of the businesses and restaurants advertising this.  We went to about ten places and all either "haven't had any Bitcoin customers since Bitcoin bowl last year" or they "couldn't find their tablet". However one place called sea critters café did accept my Bitcoin so we left happily and also left a giant tip.

Spent a few weeks in Tampa beach area this summer,  tons of places supposedly accept BTC but everyone either hasn't heard about it since the bitcoin bowl or have never heard of i at all until I pointed out the little "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker on the front door...
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:55:20
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:51:53
This happened to me more than once, and not many things infuriate me...but this does.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:32:58
Lol Asscoin?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:01:44
Ok, sorry to hear that...but at least  I know it's not only me. Has anyone else been having this issue? Probably a good thing because I've lost quite a bit to playing dice lol.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:04:32
This is hilarious and true!
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:40:50
I hope coinbase will allow me to buy when it does...
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:07:48
I'm really hoping for a deep dip, got my finger on the buy button ready and waiting!
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:56:45
I know, I can only wish it pops...bitcoin on sale!
@_date: 2013-11-04 11:13:25
Would be awesome, but the only thing that scares me is... if eBay allowed bitcoin to be used, what happens when I win an auction and I send bitcoin to a seller and my item doesn't arrive? It's not like I can just call bitcoin and have my bitcoin refunded...
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:10:09
I put a 0.04 BTC bet into 50% early this morning. It has over 100 confirmations and have not seen a payment yet. Tried again from another address and same thing happened. I posted earlier and got downvoted lol.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:55:50
I almost did this, glad I didn't ...
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:20:14
I bought @ 990, should've waited. Oh well I'll get some more!
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:49:57
Makes me wonder what would happen if Daniel Tammet messed around with it..
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:03:04
In my opinion, Just buy a bitcoin or two. $1000.00 won't put you in a big hole, and you'd still have a LOT more bitcoin than the vast majority of humans on the planet!

Already a few up votes on this comment, obviously I can't go "all in" though.

I just found out I can now instant buy on coinbase, bought some more BTC on the dip :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:01:46
If it's under the moon, it is wise to buy.
