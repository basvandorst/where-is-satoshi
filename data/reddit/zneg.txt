Dude, next time you do smth like that let us know in advance. You see what you did? Tether almost went down because of you. Anyway, we’ll pay you to stay away. Lol

To give him bitcoin would mean to reward bad habits. And in any event, flashing the money will only succeed in making him/them envious without challenging his/their ideas in the least.

It’s precisely the going down that triggers the uptrend.

Definitely. I would think it needs a severe dip to go to the highs predicted here. You never know, but if we are only now hearing of institutional money getting in, that would mean that inst. money has been slowly seeping in for some time. They will sell before buying, bleeding the alts in the process, as we saw.

No. The lesson is it may dip more than you and I are expecting, and bounce up faster than we can catch it.

Well again, if whales are getting in, they will first wipe the fomos clean. There is great opportunity for slaughter in cryptos, a lot of people who don’t know what they’re doing. 
If you’re so big as to make the price go up merely through rumors that you might be getting in, then you’d better accumulate slowly first and leak the rumors after. Sell as the price goes up. Seeing how when you go long on Bitcoin you’re shorting the alts and vice-versa, you can understand how the fomos are always doing the opposite of the whales—they buy BTC highs, sell alts on the dips. When BTC price drops because of huge sell offs, they will run back to alts which will by then have gone up. Then, BTC goes for the finish line. LOL.
