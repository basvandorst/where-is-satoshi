Exactly. Most altcoins are priced and traded in bitcoin. 
So moves in the dollar value of BTC causes a move of the dollar value if the alts.
However, recently there was a decoupling of this pattern. Btc up and alts down means that people are selling their alts and accumulating btc

there is no energy police. 
But there is external cost that is caused by burning fossil fuels like the environmental damages caused by polution or the damages that will be caused by global warming.
So as a steering mechanism for our behaviour it is very important that we internalize the external cost of energy production. 
currently on a global scale the external cost of fossil and and nuklear energy is NOT put into the price of the electricity.
And yes , you are right : this is a general issue when it comes to energy . it is not bitcoin specific. just with bitcoin it becomes quite obvious that Energy is too cheap in most parts of the world.

Its two different adress versions.

The adress starting with 3... Is  of the type a Pay to script hash (P2SH) aka segwit 
Then there is also bc1... Adresses which are called bech32 or native segwit.
The new versions allow you to open lighting channels and do occupy less space on the blockchain when you use them for transactions

If mining is not profitable for any rational miner he will will switch off his equipment. So hashrate will lower. When the hashrate has declined enough it will be profitable again. 
basically the bitcoin price defines how much money is available to spend on equipment and energy bills.
At 10k there are 18 million dollar a day available to spent for electricity. I truly hope that the price doesn't go up before the halving in order to not provide incentives to mine on fossil electricity

If Bitcoin grows 300% p.a. On average you can 
Sell 75% of your hodlings per year
Formula : 
sell rate = 100% - (100% / (100% + expected growth))
For small numbers this can be approximated as 
sell rate = growth rate
You are welcome.

thats why I am using Bitcoin. I just ask myself if there is a better way to get the same value with less resource consumtion
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:31:31
Actually it means that supply is inflated by approx. 3% p.a.
Only after the next halving it will drop below 2%.
2% is the inflation target of major central banks. So, only after the next halving Bitcoin becomes competitive as a store of value when compared to USD etc.

The hash of the block n-1 is included in the header of block n. This links each block to its ancessor.
Interesting fact : the so-called block hash is calculated by executing the hash function two times on the block header. So, technically it is a "block header hash hash"

Very well explained 
Oh.. I just luv being pedantic: 
I am quite sure that the total number of market buy vs market sell orders alone doesn't cause the  price to increase or decrease.  For example A significant sell wall could hinder the price from rising despite more volume behind the Market buy orders.
A more accurate statement would be: the price was closing higher at each of the last five days.

As of today 15.8 Million fresh USD are flowing into the system (1800 new coins x 8800 USD per coin)
If this rate drops to 1 Million USD per day in the year 2060 we still have the power of the halving ( 11 more halvings) that reduces the daily new bitcoins to 0.87
So the new equilibrium price would be 1 Million / 0.87 = 1.14 Million.
So the question is just which effect is stronger : the potential reduction of influx of new capital or the power of the halving. Since the halving is exponential I'd place my long-term bet on the halving.

A central banks prime target should be price stability and a small inflation.

I have to admit : I start to like our conversation.
"Your problem is you think the administration needs to remain operational because you lack imagination and are unable to comprehend a world without government."
Well, i will try to get rid of my lack of imagination that you found in my reasoning. let's see how you like it; 
As a not so wealthy citizen of this free capitalist world I would definitely work in the security industry.
I would focus on medium wealthy guys that did not heavily invest into security.
I would offer basic protection. If they don't think its required to pay, I would start killing their relatives in ambushes.
I think it will be a very successful business.
Or I would offer my easy justice package : you have a dispute with your neighbor? No problem just give me the money and I will silence  your neighbor forever.
Somehow i like the idea of judges not getting a regular salary but having a "donation only" income. For sure they will find enough voluntary donors. But will the quality of jurisdiction be affected?
Those business models are currently not kicking of because of a function administration. In a donation only society they would flourish. 
And to me the total freedom is closer to anarchy than to the capitalism as you know it.
Looking forward to your arguments.
Coming to the next point: why do rich people donate.
Maybe the better question would be: why do super rich people always talk about how much they donate?
Rich people use donations for two things : 1. achieving something that matters to them. That's intrinsic motivation. Similar to the motivation that makes a social person doing things without compensation (e.g. Beach cleanup). 2. Rich people want to be liked just as everyone else donations are one method to Improve their public image

A socialist would definitely not claim that his system is based on stealing.
however, your argument is flawed because bitcoin is in no way  a "mean of production"
So the ownership of the means of production remains independend from the system.
It makes me feel sick when people have zero social sense and do not understand that they have to pay taxes in order to keep the administration operational.
In a bitcoin system tax paying  will become even more important because the administration cannot print money out of thin air anymore. So every unit has to be given by some citizen before the administration  can use it to fulfill its tasks.
EDIT: guess : you are going to tell me that taxes are a bad socialist element and are basically stealing. I am preparing for that ��

Ok. I get it. You think 60 TWh is very little Energy.
I think it's a lot. And I also think : if we spend so much energy on something we better start using it!

it actually depends on yourself. 
the question is which one of following events is more likely to happen:
1. kraken looses your coins or scams you
2. you mess up with your key management and loose access to your coins.
best thing to do: 
1. learn about best practices for private key handling
2. move the coins off the exchange when you feel comfortable

The bank will not care about it. Why would they stop you? What are you going to do with the money after withdrawing it? Dig holes and hide it like Pablo Escobar?
For Any (bitcoin) deal the following happens from a banks perspective  : fiat funds just moved from the  account of the buyer to account of the seller.
There are as much people "cashing in" as there are people "cashing out". Regardless of the price. So why would banks care about it?
Banks are only in trouble if you start using bitcoin. As long as you convert to fiat to do transactions banks are just fine.

You are 100% right.
Bitcoin is *inflationary*
But the inflation rate is decreasing with every mined block until all the coins are created in 2140
With the next halvening in may 2020 the inflation rate will drop to 1.8%
However i read and heard many times that bitcoin would be deflationary.after reading a lot I am sure this is not true

Price goes up - mining becomes more profitable - more miners join the network - difficulty goes up - block reward is reduced - mining becomes less profitable - some miners go out of business - difficulty goes down - mining becomes more profitable -more miners join the network -....
This was my idea 
I actually did not consider the effect of reducing the block reward on the price - but yeah : price will go up, if you cut the supply.

lets assume miners have a distribution of marginal cost. The miners with a marginal cost higher than the current price would be  burning money if they continue to mine. So the cost of a newly mined bitcoin is equal or less than the current price.
But yeah.. Your question seems to be strange. Why are you asking?
New bitcoins are just the incentive for miners to secure the network.

I don't think Derivatives are that bad.
They need to hedge the cumulative Position of their customers. So, if their customers go long via derivatives also the platforms must get some real BTC at the end of the day.

Yes and no. They are solving different problems but at the same time they are fishing in the same lake.
When you want to protect your wealth from banks and govs over long periods  both - bitcoin and gold - can do the job. So, there is a certain competition.
But this is rather a healthy competition that results in people having more options. Its not an unhealthy competition l, where only one of the two can survive. The market is big enough for both to survive.

If the price remains at the same level The halving will make it difficult for some miners to survive. And the ones with a bad cost structure will be pushed out of the market.
However, the price may also react to the halving And make mining more profitable Despite less coins beeinf mined.

There is no mathematical reason for the 210.000 block halvening cycle.
So You are free to just fork it. Don't ask for permission.
But eventually your fork will be worthless like 99% of the forks.
What I would enjoy more is an adjusted block reward with the difficulty. Like this you could control the growth of the network and avoid great swings of the miners economics

Dollar is loosing ground. But the Dollar is coming from a really total world domination position.
What most people do not know : there are a lot of countries that have a currency pegged to the dollar or even do use USD.
So far I met the USD in below countries:
Uruguay ( prices in shops are frequently displayed in USD)
Argentina ( use USD, you can get USD at the atms)
Lebanon ( pegged to LBP and day to day use)
Oman, Saudi, Qatar, UAE ( all have national currencies that are  pegged to USD)
For sure there are much more countries, I am not aware of.
Coming to the OP.. If you live in a country where the currency is pegged to the USD for sure it doesn't make sense to google "should I invest in USD". Hence, bitcoin searches will dominate.

Less liquidity will increase volatility.
Increased volatility REDUCES adoption, because certain merchants require a low level of volatility to conduct their Business.

 The adoption of LN makes most of the altcoins irrelevant.
Viva Satoshi! Viva starkness ! Viva Chris Decker ! Bitcoin hasta la victoria siempre!

Sell?? 
Once I quit my job I may stop *buying* every month.
I only exchange bitcoin for goods and services. I definitely do not sell. Ever.

hindsight it will just look like: yeah it was dirtcheap anyways before 2020. people even had a name for 100.000.000 satoshi . they called it a "bitcoin".

Yes. His advisor was named Brock.
To honor him he called the technology Brockchain.
Just because of a misspelling people call it block chain as of today

Your investment style sounds quite aggressive.
Be aggressive if you have nothing to lose.
But don't forget to limit your risk, after winning.
If you win and you go all in with the next bet then you will lose everything sooner or later. No matter how high you were flying before

You spend a good time on bringing this together and even for answering the comments.
Unfortunately, you have some very wrong understandings about how the bitcoin market works.
The production cost of bitcoin does not have any influence on the spot price.
if a miner decides to mine with equipment that is not profitable it gives him a small share of the 1.800 coins. He will sell his coins timely because he needs to cover his electricity expenses.
If the spot price is below the electricity cost he will switch of his equipment to stop burning money.
If a miner has bought new equipment he will sell his coins also as soon as possible to pay the loan that he needed to  take for the new equipment

Somehow all of us owe Laszlo.
He was the first one to actually give value to bitcoin. If there would be only holders in the space and nobody would use bitcoin for transferring value. Bitcoin would not have any value!
Thank you, Lazlo!! You are a hero!  You did the first step!
