I didn't think that hash rate had anything to do with transactional volume? Takes the same to process a block with 1 transaction as it does a block with 2000 transactions, right? If so then what's the limiting factor, block size?

Good info, thanks.

No. "One bitcoin" is kind of a made up thing anyway. I have some bitcoin but I've never had one WHOLE bitcoin because it doesn't really matter, you can buy/trade fractions as small as one millionth (I think) of a BTC.

Let me see if I understand this properly. You're saying that my keys will exist simultaneously in both chains? So basically no matter what happens with BTC, if I just dig out my paper wallet in 40 years (assuming BTC still exists) I could then take it to my bank/exchange and cash out?
This would make me happy because I don't want to have to manage this roller coaster, I just want to put some money in now and check it again when I retire.

If I had any spare money I'd also be buying more, but definitely diversify with some alts.

Are you going to post this every 100?
I think, while this is indeed a bit of a bubble, this particular bubble won't crash as hard as some previous bubbles. I think it has some pressures behind it that will soften the landing and take it past 5k this year.
Public acceptance. With Japan, Fidelity, and other "serious" institutions taking BTC seriously it drives volume above and beyond mere speculation volume.
Dwindling supply (sort of) will smooth out dips. The more coins in the system the harder it is to pump and dump, and having more people in for the long haul also stabilizes the effects of the "fear and greed" traders.
I think these real, underlying drivers will continue to push the price up regardless of where it would otherwise go in a typical bubble, which will also keep the bubble from bursting quite as violently.
However I also think that it will plateau for a really annoying long time once it reaches its peak... whatever that is.
