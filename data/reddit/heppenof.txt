Because there is always a trusted third party when you exchange for fiat.
And I trust a centralized exchange more than some random guy on a decentralized exchange.

Every miner is working on a different block, one that assigns the mining reward to their own Bitcoin address. And there is no way to predict what nonce value will be the correct one, so it doesn't matter where you start either.

Eloquent. And correct.

I think you're a little confused here. The bitcoin network can function perfectly well without non mining nodes. In fact that's what it was in the beginning!
Non mining nodes allow people who don't want to mine to participate in the network (send and receive transactions), but they are not involved in securing the network or enforcing the consensus rules. (unless you mean indirectly, where the miners are economically incentivised to follow certain rules because they know that there are a lot of economic users out there who will not use their blockchain if they don't).

It's clearly just an excuse to get out of doing the work to merge the code from bitcoin core.
In fact that's what this entire update is, coming up with lame excuses why no work has been done.  Linking to a Wikipedia definition of a code freeze to justify it... LOL

... plus the whole not oxidising thing.

It's taking a while! I guess supercomputers must have a long startup process.

Wow I've rarely seen so many sentences that are wrong in a row like this.

100/0 then. Doesn't make sense to dedicate anything to a less profitable coin

"Got in touch with him a few years ago to ask. He didn't even save his private key..."
That's what I would tell people too

That's exactly the kind of thing Satoshi Nakamoto would say.

Reminiscent of Jobs' "you're holding it wrong".
