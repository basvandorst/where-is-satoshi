Coinbase's customer service reps aren't actual Coinbase employees. They are hired as contractors so they don't have to give them the perks of being a real employee. I was offered the job but rejected it when they told me I wouldn't truly be a part of the company.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:23:25
nah dude it's deeper than that. the whole point of these points/rewards programs is to encourage use of these cards, which means more transaction fees, which are ultimately being passed on to the consumer. so by using your card you help to drive demand for accepting amex/mc/discover etc which is bad for the world economy as it's just siphoning off cash to these companies for doing a service that we can do on our own now with bitcoin. These silly point/rewards programs are the last thing they have to try to convince you cc's have some value

I live in Japan and it's really too bad there isn't more bitcoin activity over here. I'm hoping I can go to TechCrunch's Tokyo event in November and seeing if anything is bubbling up, or at least seeing if it's on anyone's mind. 
So I have this little idea and I'd rather not make a whole post about it so I guess I'll just write it here and hopefully get a little feedback. Maybe you're looking at the comments of this post because you are interested in Japan's bitcoin situation. I am passionate about bitcoin and have a few ideas to promote them here in Japan. Here's one.
So like everyone, I love the idea of a bitcoin ATM. If you've been paying attention you've noticed that the idea has been very difficult to make into reality, for many reasons. 
One way to come at this idea from a different angle would be to make it possible to 'win' bitcoins in a UFO catcher (or crane/claw game as they call it in the US). There are TONS of these in Japan (examples of what they look like [here]( [and here](
Just like in the US, sometimes you will see a gumball machine that has a few balls containing $5 bills inside.
So basically it's a way to get bitcoin to people IRL, in Japan. Now if I were to set this up it should probably be done in Tokyo's 'geek capital' Akihabara. 
Now the goal of it would be for it to act like a vending machine without actually BEING a vending machine. The primary goal is to be able to distribute bitcoin, not rip people off with a claw that won't grab hard enough for you to get your prize, so the solution is using one of the claw machines that lets you win quite a few items per try. There are lots of them here where the claw grabs for little folded pieces of paper, and you usually get 4-10 or so each time. Now the traditional system for those is that most have nothing inside them, but some have a special stamp or something that lets you know you won a prize. If the little pieces of paper had redeemable codes or QR's (each containing 10cents worth of btc each (just an estimation, all logistics would be considered if it was made a reality) then people could put in a 100yen coin and 'win' 40cents to 1 dollar worth of btc that they could redeem from a site.
The whole thing would likely be treated as a novelty and escape the scrutiny of a formal 'ATM' fixture.
If this existed it would be awesome!
Just an idea! Let me know what you think!

@_date: 2013-10-24 14:25:17
Virtually every one of these machines in Japan is 100yen per try, so I'd likely go with that. The prizes would be denoted in YEN, not btc and the conversion/calculation would take place at the web portal where you redeem these prizes.

this argument is getting cliche. sure they aren't very interested in bitcoin now, but there are tons of other technologies they started using way before the rest of the world like IC cards and QR codes. Those things didn't have any 'momentum' anywhere else yet they took off in Japan. 
Personally, I'd love to see something like this Ubuntu manga being made for Japan to help spread the word of bitcoin.

I am not at all. He doesn't have nearly as much influence as this guy makes out. I do think that his 'buy silver crash JP Morgan' thing was a little wacky, but still. RT has a clear agenda in which Kaiser fits perfectly. Overall I'd like to see less price speculation and speculation about the speculation of speculators, and more conversation about how to get bitcoin working as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:19:13

This event is going to be huge. Nearly all of the big names in Bitcoin will be there, and I know there will be some major announcements made. 
This list of speakers is just incredible  I'd go for Roger Ver alone.
The price to attend, though, is just too steep for me. Currently it's $250 or 5.6BTC. I am a college student, and even though I live just an hour from the event, I simply cannot afford that price. 
I emailed Lindsay Holland of the Bitcoin Foundation, she's organizing the event, to ask if they would consider adding a student price option. She said they would think about it, but so far I haven't seen anything.
If you can afford it, don't miss it.

This idea may seem out of nowhere, but could we call this 'racist'?
In the bitcoin economy, all btc need to be 'valid' regardless of 'color'. 
Basically we could say that this is 'discriminatory' because 'lower-income individuals' (minorities) are more likely to have their btc and/or wallets 'contaminated'.
For example, could we really see a vendor reject a homeless native-american lesbian's btc because she has a 'tainted' address? Couldn't she claim discrimination?
Maybe I'm missing something here. Actually I know I am, this whole issue is quite complex.
