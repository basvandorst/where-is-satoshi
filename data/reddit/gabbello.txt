So many fallacies in this article:
"Bitcoin is best thought of as a 5- to 10-year project, and we’re at the very early stages. " - bitcoin just turned 6 year old, so just went over half of the timeframe mentioned even by the author. BTC is not an incredible new technology for IT timeframes.
"Those of us old enough to remember using Navigator to browse the Web over a Winsock connection on a 56k baud modem can attest that it was not the amazing experience we take for granted today" - really? I was waking up at 3 am (phone line was cheaper during night) to stay on net with my 33.6k modem. And it was an amazing experince, otherwise I would not have do it each night.
"For one thing, there was no easy way to find things on the Web. Well, we didn’t get Google until 1998." - ever heard of yahoo, just to name the predecesor of google.
"So, if we take the Web as a parallel, we’re at the stage in Bitcoin were we would hope to see a Mosaic level development, not a Facebook. " - that's like saying that building a car in 1920s took the same amount of time as it takes now.
"Here’s why I don’t focus on price much." - people expect that bitcoin becomes a global currency, but somehow not focus on the price. Give me the same services today for 1 BTC as you would have been offering 6 months ago for the same 1 BTC and then I don't focus on price/fiat value.

Yes, but psihologially the invested amount will be diffrent when buying some obscure 1$ cryptocoins that nobody heard of, versus when buying something that is all over the news.

Read the first line from the website:
Go to Virwox main site and register your account.

And how is the currency of those countries viewed? is it considered anything more than toilet paper?

People need to undersstand that a drop from 32 to 2 although is higher in terms of percentage might be economically better than one from 500 to 100. It's one thing to loose a couple hundred dollars over a "hobby" and it is diffrent to loose thousands over what you considered an important investment.

"The vast majority of the price appreciation occurred while Bitcoin was generating 50 BTC every ten minutes." True, but the dificulty/minning cost was way less than today.

yes, beacuse money transfers with a surprise (+/- 20% of the value by the time the recipient manages to cash out) would be a big hit. It will be transfering money AND playing the lottery in the same time

So what is the logic of buying bitcoins? Only investment/speculation on bitcoin price or black market/tax evasion? Then I doubt bitcoin will be succesful at any point soon.

Companies that don't accept anything else then creditcards will never accept bitcoins anyway. They want credit card/paypal specifically for chargeback

It wasn't dificult to use internet, and the article point was that it wasn't "amazing", not that it wasn't simple.
Of course Yahoo was worse than google, but option to find data existed.

Yes, but there is a vicious cycle, why would anyone use bitcoins as a currency (and not for speculation only) if the prices are fully coupled with fiat price? There is no sense to buy bitcoins with fiat (and pay some fees) and then buy a product with bitcoins that you could have bought initially with (less) fiat than you spent on getting bitcoins.
