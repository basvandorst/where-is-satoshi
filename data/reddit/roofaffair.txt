False, not every miner would be willing to sell those coins.
You could buy the equivalent of a days worth of mining depending on market price price of $555.55 or lower. However your question relates to every freshly mined coin within a specific time-frame which would not be possible.

With bitcoin, you decide how much control you want. When you give full control of your funds to a third party custodial wallet/service such as Mt.Gox, you run the risk of them mismanaging your Bitcoin.
If you don't hold/control the keys, you don't own the Bitcoin.
Cash also suffers from this as you can see in the informational video linked below.

Yes, but you only need to backup the wallet.dat file. Keep in mind, by default core/QT only keeps a pool of 100 pre-generated keys. If you don't update your backup and go past the initial key pool your backup will not be complete putting funds at risk.
However for "safer" storage and backup look into various cold storage, multisig, or hardware wallet options. A wallet.dat file is only as secure as the password you use to protect it.

You paid a fee of 76.51041667 sat/B. According to  your transaction should get confirmed within or around of 3-18 blocks. Roughly 3 hours.
Your fee estimation in the wallet might have aimed a little low if it was set for a priority transaction. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:33:09
Nope, there is nothing at risk.
It's essentially a bug in how you derive the keys from the seed. This allows you to use a single seed and get two separate yet entirely valid addresses/wallets.
In normal use case this isn't an issue, it's only noticeable if you recover your wallet using a bugged implementation as it would give you the an entirely new set of addresses. Using non-bugged software would recover the original wallet.

If you enabled 2-factor authentication between the 12th and the 20th February 2017, we strongly recommend you disable and re-enable it again.

Coins are never really "*stuck*" They are either confirmed, or in the original wallet/address.
When they are marked as pending/unconfirmed they still reside in the original wallet but are marked as unavailable. Only once it confirms are the coins moved.
As such a "*stuck*" transaction can always be modified prior to confirmation. This can allow you to replace the same inputs with a higher fee, or double spend it elsewhere to decrease the time it takes to get a confirmation.
After 72 hours, most wallets will drop an unconfirmed transaction allowing you to re-use those inputs in a future transaction. Some wallets however will also automatically re-broadcast keeping the transaction in an apparent limbo longer.
There's always a way to rescan or remove pending transactions through advanced/developer options. This is assuming you're using a wallet that gives you control over the private keys. Custodial wallets would require you to contact their support.
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:51:05
I generally don't use electrum, but a quick search of their docs showed that they do drop transactions after "several days." It also looks like they don't automatically rebroadcast.
However electrum is a light client (connects to other nodes) it's possible that a node it connects to would not drop the transaction for some time delaying it further.
You can always try to forcefully remove the unconfirmed transaction by wiping the wallet and restoring your backup seed. (potential risk to exposing backup seed)

Briefly looking at the issue, it doesn't appear to put Bitcoin balances in danger. No matter which derivation you used, you can recover from each respectively.
It would cause a panic if you tried to recover your seed and it gave you a bunch of new addresses.
Going forward, wallets might have to do a quick check of both derivations to ensure a past user wasn't unknowingly affected.

Microbits is great and works for me. Bit works great a short form of the word bitcoin (makes sense too.) 
This allows an easy to say short form of decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit. Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name and abbreviates/drops the logical parts.
One flawed argument for bit that I see, is that it's synonymous with something small. I'd argue that micro is much more synonymous with small, in nearly every place around the world except the US. Thankfully a product from the 80's and 90's had already ingrained micro into the minds of a generation living in the US.

1, Yes, it requires a hardfork, but even if it didn't they would still push a hardfork. To BU, it's a method of *firing,* seizing control, and locking out current contributors/developers.

BU is a power grab framed as a scaling debate. They simply want to *"fire"* the core dev team and control the direction of bitcoin themselves. 
There is nothing technical about this debate, it's purely political at this point. Example being, if core were to implement the unlimited code changes today. BU would immediately find another way to differentiate their project. They use controversy as a way to keep the mantra of removing and replacing core.
It's a hardfork for the sake of hardforking and shifting control. It introduces numerous issues and new attack vectors. Majority of which they have no solution to, except a belief that no one would exploit them.

I would not support any hardfork on the pretense that this hardfork would include nothing other than a blocksize increase/segwit.
Hard forks should include as many well tested/reviewed updates that cannot occur through safer softforks and occur only when deemed absolutely necessary or in cases of emergency.
Using a hardfork or potentially multiple hardforks as a method to make small singular changes to bitcoin is needlessly reckless and jeopardizes the bitcoin project as a whole.

The bug messes up how addresses/wallets are derived from the seed. The addresses/wallets are completely valid and have no issues on their own. However if you try to recover your wallet using something that wasn't affected by this bug it will give you an entirely different wallet.
Think of it as if the bug is unknowingly adding extra data to your seed therefore making it incompatible with other implementations but still valid. 
IE you created a wallet and see the seed as ***1Bitcoinwallet*** however when generated with software that had this bug the seed is actually ***1Bitcoinwallet+bug*** This is enough to give you an entirely different wallet based on whether your keys were derived from a bugged implementation or not.
To recover it correctly you need to use software that either has the bug, or in the future will be aware of the bug and automatically check both derivations for balances.

Ok, I wasn't sure how much you knew previously.
Very briefly, Bitcoin is open source. As such anyone can use the code then modify it in anyway they choose and release their own idea of bitcoin.
This leads to people taking bitcoin, copying *everything* and changing a single parameter to create their own coin. 
They try to build hype as if it's the next new thing while awarding themselves countless free coins as a "dev fund" despite not having any real dev teams. It quickly devolves into a pump and dump. build hype to get the coin listed on an exchange, then dump all the coins the *"*dev*" gave themselves to make some quick money and abandon the project.
The alluring thing about altcoins when it comes to potential miners, is that they try to be GPU and CPU mining friendly. However profiting off alt coins generally comes down to taking part in the pump and dump schemes, hoping to dump your coins before others onto unsuspecting people.
That's not to say there isn't *some* innovation to be found in altcoins, but it's far and few between that chances of finding it with intention to profit off it is exceedingly rare.

Incorrect. Gavin left the project by choice long before having his commit access removed. Not only was it not being used, but could be seen as a liability especially during the Craig Wright fiasco.
Gavin's lack of commit access has no effect on him being able to submit pull requests, help with development, or make proposals. Understanding how github works is the first step to realize why removing his commit access did not affect his ability to contribute.
There was no reason for him to keep his commit access after stepping down as lead developer for the project.
I'd argue he should have requested his commit access be removed immediately when he left the project.

Inactive and former btc mod SouperNerd became active after abandoning his social media presence for months. He then started to show unfounded hostility towards Nullc and seemingly began pushing an agenda.
Nullc quickly questioned the account holder and posted evidence showing that SouperNerd had attempted and likely succeeded in selling his account. The new account holder was completely unaware of the prior interactions which tried to solicit the account.
This triggered attempts at account scrubbing by SouperNerd with assistance by those helping defend him with some posts being removed, or edited to change the narrative.
Evidence shown was in the form of PM's and contained an email due to the inherent nature of them being *"private messages"* Ver or others compliant with btc's views likely proceeded to report for doxing.

As long as the discussion isn't focused on, advocates, or is advertising for said altcoin it's "*ok*."
XT for example was fine to discuss openly when it was merely an idea/proposition. It wasn't until they implemented a client with active code designed to fork and tried to push it that it became classified as an altcoin. Posts then advertising and shilling for that client were removed as they broke the sub-reddit rules.
Similar situation with BU, except they skipped most of the idea and discussion phase and jumped right to implementing an active hardfork client, turning it into an altcoin. Then cried about not being allowed to advertise it.

It's also important to note that the data is all held in the same block with all other transaction data. It's not a separate file that contains the data or anything like that.

Interesting idea, but I don't think it could work. I'd like to be proven wrong but my general assumption is that the opposition to segwit could attack segwit transactions. By altering segwit transactions or spending them in their blocks it would cause a fork with only the minority of segwit nodes rejecting it. The rest of the non-segwit miners and nodes accept attack as they wouldn't verify the segwit data. This is why segwit adoption consensus is set to 95%

Allow me put on the tinfoil hat for a moment to add:
It potentially goes further with BitcoinXio at one point corroborating past and present interactions which, if the account had been sold would not have been known or taken place. 
This brings into question willful collusion, the account purchaser is known to them, on the current btc mod team, or it was an excessively long con bait and switch with a complete personality and writing style change.
I cannot stress enough that the above is just pure conjecture, speculating based on nothing more than the comments I had seen and should not be taken seriously.

It would be rejected by the minority of segwit nodes. All other nodes, including non-upgraded core nodes and miners would see the intentionally malicious block as valid.

From the summary


**higher compression is a tradeoff for lower privacy**. However, the tradeoff choice is left to
individual users.
I'm all for additional and alternate scaling methods, but I believe privacy should be a top priority. Chain analysis and forensics are increasingly threatening fungibility every day. Lessening privacy, even as an opt-in is not a good compromise in my opinion. 
Using higher transaction throughput as an incentive with the trade off being that it lowers privacy while not compatible with current transaction format sounds like a risky idea. How long would it take before regulators start to force exchanges, and big business to use this new transaction format. It would somewhat lock users into lower privacy transactions to *allow* easier aml/kyc and tracking.

Has your transaction been confirmed? Most place will require at least 1 confirmation before they send you your item. Unconfirmed transactions pose a risk to merchants as they can be double spent, or get dropped from the mempool if the fee is too low.

Every node maintains it's own mempool of transactions. Each following it's own set of rules for accepting, dropping, or rebroadcasting. 
A transaction may be accepted by one node, but not another due to an input below that nodes pre-configured dust or spam threshold.
Restarting a node will clear that users active mempool. Requiring transactions to be broadcasted again to see them in their mempool. Some transactions may not automatically get rebroadcasted unless requested.
In short, both services are running their own nodes and crawlers giving them similar albeit different mempools.

When transferring between bitcoin and local currency, you will likely find it difficult to avoid exchange AML/KYC without a large cost. If you want to have your local currency withdrawn to your bank account, you will need to provide that information somewhere along the line. However this is limited to dealing with an exchange/broker and not individual users.
Within bitcoin, there are no names, emails, or any identifying information used when sending/receiving bitcoin.
If you want to receive bitcoin from someone, all you need to do is provide them an address. 
As an example, here's an address that I control. 1Hw4kxh2joKKrn1LVx4hKM1NNakw37YCzm
You can send me bitcoin directly and it doesn't reveal any personal, or private information unless I chose to disclose it. Keep in mind, this works both ways, the receiver cannot identify who sent, or reject bitcoins that are sent to an address. If you are setting up a store front, make sure you have a way for the sender to identify themselves/transaction.

Nope, each address is completely unique and cannot be associated with another address generated by the same seed. You can accidentally link addresses through a transactions inputs/outputs but you can not determine where an unused address may be linked.
Every address you generate is derived from your seed by essentially hashing "seed+1" and increasing the number for each address you generate giving you a new unique address.
The wallet stores these keys together by merely generating iterations of your seed+n.

Ok, so lets say a 1080 makes $5 a day. You want to earn $200 a day; by the powers of math this tells me you would need 40 1080s in a minimum of 6 rigs. Add in mining variance and you may earn more, or less tomorrow.
The 1080 isn't the greatest in terms of price - performance - watt so you may get much better results with something like an amd RX 470 or a fury but require even more GPUs/rigs.
It's a massive upfront investment that may never pay off, are you willing to take that risk?

An important unknown metric is how much of the supposed BU hashrate would be controlled by one or two colluding individuals?
Not all supporters of BU should be assumed malicious. Proposing or implementing any hardfork preemptively could potentially be worse than the alternative. 
Hashrate dedicated to attacking Bitcoin, is hashrate not contributing to BU. As far as I know BU doesn't have a difficulty adjustment as part of their fork. Meaning both chains will likely be similarly slow as difficulty takes time to adjust.
I also see standing our ground and not changing POW would end up weakening BU further due to current miners remaining split and greatly increasing their centralization. The super majority hashrate for BU would be held by an individual. While the Bitcoin hashrate could remain somewhat more decentralized. Switching POW would push all miners to BU and keep mining as decentralized as Bitcoin currently is.
I'll quickly add that the option to concede should not even be there. The code is not well vetted or tested enough to even consider that a viable option.

There are many more issues at hand than simply bandwidth/storage.
You still need to verify and validate the blocks. This is where quadratic scaling becomes an issue. This would allow a miner to craft an *attack* block which is entirely valid but requires excess resources to validate. By mining a block that takes lets say 2 minutes for an average CPU to validate would effectively give that miner a 20% greater chance at finding the next block than other miners.
Quadratic scaling is an issue already, but the impact of which becomes exponentially greater with even a modest blocksize increase.

I'd say yes, but not for the reason you may think.
If all "illegal" activity was removed from bitcoin, it would mean that it had become 100% permission based. Every transaction would have to go through a centralized third party to verify it's legality before being propagated to the network.
This would destroy any value bitcoin had. Thankfully, it's not possible.
Illegal activity in itself doesn't provide the value of bitcoin, but forcefully removing it would have a massive negative effect.

I don't disagree with him in context. Advocating and organizing such *attacks* is where I would disagree on the morality of the messenger.
Whether you agree or not; knowing, and to an extent open discussion of possible attack vectors is the only way we can become prepared and able to defend ourselves. You cannot strengthen the Bitcoin network by hoping someone won't exploit a weakness.
If attack vectors are not openly looked into, you have the real risk of people running poorly implemented code. The last thing we want is to have a bunch of people rally behind flawed code based more on politics and ideology than technical merits.

You shouldn't be worried. All addresses generated do correlate to your backup recovery seed. Worst case, and unlikely is that you have funds in addresses derived in both a bugged, and non-bugged way.
Right now, it's a wait and see with how a fix gets implemented. It may be that all wallets going forward add a quick dual seed check for the bug and choose the correct derivative. In which case you won't have to do anything. 
It really is a non-issue for the most part and won't affect anyone and likely won't require any action by users. Those who have been affected will likely never know after fixes get applied.

A deadlock is the natural resting state of bitcoin. Upgrades and obtaining consensus should be difficult, no matter the changes in question. Bitcoin will always be under attack in some form or another. Its resistance to change is a feature, not a bug, or lack of a "focal point."

Selfishly mining empty blocks would help reach our difficulty adjustment quicker. Would likely be the best scenario.
The time they spend mining on the original chain, is hashrate lost on their chain, slowing it down. Unless the hashrate split is massive, they won't have the hashrate to spare in a sustained blockchain re-org attack.

Nope, a planned and non-controversial HF would have plenty of lead time and notice.
However what we are dealing with now, is comparable to a few unstable school kids rallying others and convincing people to join them so they can burn down the school and build a new one without bullies. All because they're holding a grudge after their feelings got hurt when their ideas and proposals got rejected.
They will likely preemptively try and fork as soon as they feel comfortable and have it blow up in their face. The majority of nodes and miners will reject their fork and continue on as normal.

The fee was slightly above 50 sat/byte. This is a low fee in comparison to current transaction demand.
To get a quick confirmation you would set a sort of *high priority* fee around 210 - 220 sat/byte. 
Your transaction will either get confirmed in the coming days, or dropped from the mempool allowing you to try again. If it's urgent, you can attempt a double spend using the same input but with a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:49:15


That's only true for the next 2016 blocks. After that the difficulty adjusts to compensate for the added mining any block time increase is gone. You would have to increase the hashrate by 20% every two weeks if you wanted to see an equivalent 1.2mb. That kind of growth quickly gets exponential and unsustainable. 


You know blockstream isn't the bitcoin core client right? Blockstream throws money at some developers which spend their time working on core, but they don't influence or control bitcoin core in any way.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:33:59
That's only partially correct.
Open discussion of proposals, bips, and non-core clients was completely welcomed and to a large extent still is. The issue started when XT added the controversial code to their client and had it's supporters aggressively shill, spam, and push it in every thread here. The moment the client had code that intentionally broke consensus it became an altcoin. Despite it's threshold, and bootstrapping off bitcoin it was and is an altcoin. 
The amount of spam got out of hand quickly and honestly it was a breath of relief when it was stopped.

 has a list of some of the wallets available with a brief outline on their strengths and weaknesses.
The biggest thing you need to ask yourself when selecting a wallet is do you want control of your coins not. A custodial wallet will not give you access to your keys directly and maintain full control over your funds. It can be more convenient but comes with the greater risk of trusting a third party with your money. 
A wallet where you control the keys can be less convenient at times but is more secure as you don't need to trust anyone but yourself. It's recommended to stay away from custodial wallets when possible, when it's not only keep a minimal amount with them.
Remember, you can have as many wallets as you like. There's no reason not to try them and all and find one that suites you best.

That's simply not true. They're not remotely equal and are completely different denominations.
The change to "bit" was a half assed marketing push which attempted to call the denomination known as microbitcoin a "bit" and potentially switch to it as a primary unit. It has never been used to refer to millibitcoin unless mistakenly so. I believe it was Bitpay that was behind it to some degree.
I'm against calling microbitcoins "bit" in the sense that "bit" should only be short for bitcoin. This allows all the standard prefixes to drop a syllable ie decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit. Of course using the full bitcoin works just as well too.

As long as you understand that is a real possibility. High risk, for potentially high reward. If you do decide to buy in; try to avoid frequent trading during times of high volatility. You will likely end up losing more than you would have by remaining calm and waiting it out.

I think "bit" is a poor choice for a single unit value. You can literally shorten Bitcoin to Bit. It also makes using Bit as a short form of bitcoin much more appealing.
This way you get standard units as decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit. The naming scheme is common, understood worldwide (*barring* the us), easy to remember, and logical.

If they fork off the network at 51% it means next to nothing. There will be a price drop and some disputes for the sudden "split" and emergence of an altcoin that tries to call itself bitcoin.
Block times (on both chains) will take 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes on average delaying the difficulty adjustment to 1 month. After which everything carries on as normal.
This would not be a 51% attack, as they would be breaking consensus and splitting off the network. Not using their hashpower to rewrite or maliciously attack the blockchain.

Mining something like bitcoin would be completely pointless and would not earn you anything. Assuming you manage to turn it into a botnet mining 100 Ghash, you could expect less than $2 per month.
Some alt coins do *claim* to be cpu only which would allow you to compete with other botnets. Unfortunately their liquidity is so small you would take further losses trying to convert it into Bitcoin on exchanges.

But they do say *cent* derived from centi, with full name being centidollar referring to hundredth. 
Within context, the base unit isn't needed allowing you to further shorten to just the prefix. Eventually the same can be said for bitcoin within context mills, or mics/mikes would work as short abbreviations of the units. It doesn't get any easier than that while still maintaining a global understanding of measurement (outside the US.)
Everyone in the world buys and sells in metric, and then has to convert for the US market. We should stick with metric, the scientific, logical measurement system. There's no need to add further confusion to Bitcoin units because Americans don't understand it immediately. That's an education issue, not a problem with a base 10 measurement that allows you to easily calculate it by simply moving the decimal.

The "SI norm" has several units.
Here's how the SI metric prefix's fit into Bitcoin.
Decibitcoin = 0.1 BTC
Centibitcoin = 0.01 BTC
Millibitcoin = 0.001 BTC
Microbitcoin = 	0.000001 BTC
This however leaves a few units in base 10 unnamed. The smallest of which is accepted as a Satoshi. After that there are groups of 10 Satoshi which was suggested as a Finney in memoriam of Hal Finney years ago; who was part of the first transaction and helped pioneer bitcoin.
My rejection of *"bit"* is both in it's terrible naming, but more so that the unit denomination in particular already has a common and used name. Choosing an unnamed base 10 unit would be better, something between a Millibitcoin, and a Microbitcoin for example.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:27:06

When a pool sees a new block on the network, in order to not waste time, it immediately starts mining an empty block because it has no idea what transactions were included in the previous one it's mining on top of.
As the pool verifies the transactions in the block and updates their mempool it sends new work to the miners to start mining a block full of transactions.
This block in particular was solved only 5 seconds after the previous one. Enough time to see and start mining a new block, but not long enough to verify and update the mempool without risky SPV mining.

Centidollar is the full name of what is commonly called "cents" in currency. It follows the metric prefix of centi meaning hundredth. Over time and within context people removed the "dollar" as the base unit is not required for understanding.

Financial privacy. You don't need to be doing something illegal to want financial privacy.
Here's a couple quick examples.
You get paid by your employer in Bitcoin. If you don't mix those funds, they can now watch and monitor how and where you are spending your money. Whether you are saving, spending, gambling, donating, etc. This is something that is not possible with current payments and would be a massive invasion of privacy if it were. These basic privacy obfuscation features are not built into bitcoin and must be added through second layers IE mixers.
If you pay for a sandwich at the local sandwich shop using bitcoin and don't mix it. The cashier can now associate your identity with that address and either follow every future transaction you make, or trace back and estimate how much money you earn/have. No one should have this kind of information on your personal finances and spending habits.
While not quite the same, you can think of it as if every time you used your debit card, you handed over a read-only login for your bank statement. Places you spent, and received from are reduced account numbers but given enough time you can unravel and identify with a decent probability where that money went, and who it came from.
Spending habits and financial information is a very valuable metric. With Bitcoin, it's now possible to associating your online digital presence (web browsing, social media, etc) with your financials (how much you earn, how much you save, when you spend, where you spend, etc.)
Blockchain analysis is becoming a big business and we need mixers and official obfuscation software built into bitcoin more than ever.

Centibitcoin 10^-2 0.01 cBTC
Millibitcoin 10^-3 0.001 mBTC
Microbitcoin 10^-6 0.000001 μBTC
And the smallest unit, is known as a Satoshi 10^-8 while not part of the standard metric prefix, it's a nice homage to bitcoins creator.
By using *bit* as a shortened form of bitcoin, they become even nicer to say such as millibit, or microbit.

It was a marketing ploy started by Bitpay in an effort to corner the market with name recognition. It's been unfortunately successful in that most people don't recognize it as marketing and many support its widespread use.
It's far better to stick with, and use the SI metric denominations which are known and understood worldwide (less so in the US) Decibitcoin, Centibitcoin, Millibitcoin, Microbitcoin, and Satoshi as the smallest denomination as it resides between the measurements of Micro, and Nano. I'd also support the use of Finney for denominations of 10 satoshi's.

Using a hardfork or potentially multiple hardforks as a method to make small singular changes to bitcoin is needlessly reckless and jeopardizes the bitcoin project as a whole.

Bit is a terrible name for a unit. It's much better to keep it as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit.
We don't need to make arbitrary new symbols for existing prefix's. Those symbols already exist. Use them in any combination of millibit, millibitcoin, mbitcoin, mbit, mBTC, m₿ (bitcoin symbol once it gets added to unicode 10.) The satoshi could use a symbol, or just stick with *"s"* for symbol and *"sat"* for prefix.
Prefix | Symbol | 10^n | decimal| English Scale 
deci| d | 10^-1 | 0.1 | Tenth
centi | c | 10^-2 | 0.01 | Hundredth 
milli | m | 10^-3 | 0.001| Thousandth
micro | μ | 10^-6 | 0.000001| Millionth

Currently the maximum block size is 1MB.
This gives a current max growth of:
144 MB per day
and 
52,560 MB per year
5 years at 1MB capacity would be an additional 262,800 MB. 10 years, 525,600 MB, and 50 years would be 2,628,000 MB.

The full name of millibitcoin may seem long at first but you can shorten in. Instead of using *bits* as a unit (terrible in my opinion) use it as being short for bitcoin. Millibitcoin can be quickly and easily referred to millibit. Going further as you alluded to with microfarads mils, and millies would also work as context suggests only the prefix is needed for understanding.
You might be surprised how many international keyboards have an alt character set which includes µ. Using a u as a replacement is also fine colloquially but should µ in any professional capacity. Typing µBTC, uBTC, muBTC, µBits, uBits, muBits are all acceptable.
Using *bits* also induces a lot of confusion for anyone trying to learn about bitcoin as the term bit is rather prevalent. 


There are two main issues with *bit* 
1) It absolutely conflicts with SI prefix's. It's an attempt to replace the name of an existing unit 10^-6 with something else, not just an alias. There are other unit denominations within Bitcoin decimal that don't have a name, why not try and shove a name on 10^-5 or 10^-4 ?
2) It's name is awful and can easily cause confusion among all other uses of bit within bitcoin. It's really better suited as a short form of bitcoin allowing decibit, centibit, millibit, and microbit.

Running a full node is not mining and gives zero reward. Everyone who runs a node is doing it out of pocket.
Mining is the only part of bitcoin that sees a reward in the form of new bitcoins upon solving a block. Mining requires a massive amount of computing power that uses an excessive amount of electricity and a large initial upfront cost for the hardware.

Here's my prediction. I could see the price continue to hold or increase gradually, then a brief rapid increase (similar to what we just experienced) followed by a relatively large downward spike a day or two before and after halving.
Many speculators are/have been purchasing with expectations that the halving will magically increase their holdings. They will be set and waiting to sell at the foretold highs. "Smart" sellers will begin shorting or selling just before the halving as early as a day or two before. This will trigger nervous speculators to also sell, scaring others, continuing the trend. Add in FUD about Bitcoin no longer able to support itself through mining at current price to help bolster a bears position and we will have a fun roller coaster.
After a week or two, things will return to normal around where we are now. Maybe higher, maybe lower. In a month we will begin to see the effect on mining and how fewer new coins entering the market will change the price.
Overall I'd say in the long-term the price will increase due to fewer new coins entering the market, but it won't be smooth. Bitcoin will continue it's trend of high volatility with many price swings both low and high.
Whether you should purchase now, or wait is entirely up to you. No one can say what's best to do with your money and those that try to predict the market might as well base their trading on the shake of a magic 8 ball.

Great, expect mass exodus as media reports *Bitcoin has crashed in China, from ¥6000 to ¥6!* If they only do this for Bitcoin, and not other altcoins it will look heavily skewed and potentially turn into an altcoin pump.
If the exchanges do attempt to push millibitcoins, I sincerely hope they will not set this as the default/only option. Instead, make the various deci, centi, milli, micro bitcoins options available and known when the user logs in/signs up. Make milli the *recommended* option but don't force it on anyone.
An emphasis on how this is using the milli prefix and not just "mBTC" to denote it's 1000th of something is important as well.

Until a transaction is confirmed, it remains in the original address. So yes, it will be "back" in the paper wallet as it never left.

Another possibility if you want to wear a conspiracy hat, while unlikely would be to spam the network anytime you notice a price increase. Thus when the price does a correction and retracts (as it always does) you can use a congested network as the reason in an attempt to push an agenda.

If you don't like the blockstream hub you have a couple options. One, route around it; you don't need to use theirs, there will be many hubs run by many people. Two, you can always create your own; setting its fees and prices as you see fit. 
The intended use of the LN anyone is that anyone can use it and/or create their own. The hubs with the most use will require a large enough amount of locked coins, and a low enough fee that competes with all other hubs (another *fee market.*) It's not some single centralized hub in the hands of a single person/company.

The nice thing about Bitcoin being open-source, is that nearly any "upgrade" that makes an alternate coin better can be added to Bitcoin. Assuming it doesn't harm the network, security, fungibility, or decentralization.
Systemic failure can come in the form of an undiscovered, exploitable bug in the code that cannot be patched.
The reason most people are here, and why we are looking at a price of $860 is because we all read, viewed, and researched similar articles, videos, papers and came to the same conclusion. Or at the very least, the potential unknown downsides are greatly outweighed by the upsides.

People like to speculate on why the price has increased, but no one really knows why. The price can also fall just as quickly and unexpectedly as it rose. Looks like demand is simply higher than supply for the past day.
There are some talks about an exchange that got hacked and was in the process of buying back about $200,000 worth of Bitcoin. This could have been enough to break through some important price ceilings and cause and trigger the rally.
There could also be some insider trading occurring if someone knows something big is about to happen it can get reflected on the price before the news breaks.

True, but rushing to develop something beyond the analysis, design and basic coding template phase when prerequisite code needs to be activated first is a little presumptuous of the future direction bitcoin may take.
It's better to plan out and get a basic idea and concept, then move onto other aspects of bitcoin which requires work that could see benefits today. As a malleability fix gets closer to being locked in, then we will see developers dedicate more time to future upgrades and working implementations of LN based on whatever variation of the malleability fix was activated.

You don't need a *good* connection, but you do need for it to be up 24/7. Mining in a pool requires a constant back and forth of receiving and submitting shares. They don't require much bandwidth but do require an active connection.
That S7 miner according to the description mines at about 4.7 TH/s. Currently estimated at about 0.1052 BTC per month / $86.19 usd. However the difficulty and price are in constant fluctuation so expected *earnings* are not accurate. 
Check  to take a look at how the difficulty has been rising, as well as how much it's expected to rise with the next adjustment (every two weeks.) A 12% increase in difficulty means your miner will suddenly mine 12% fewer bitcoin. The price could increase to compensate, but it's never a guarantee and turning a profit or an ROI with mining can be difficult.
Setting up a miner can be as easy as connecting it to your home router, then logging into it through your PC to configure and start it. Mining on a regular computer is not a viable option for bitcoin. You could attempt to mine various altcoins using multiple high powered GPUs but even then you're your chances of ROI may not be great.
Power consumption/miner efficiency greatly impacts whether you can turn a profit or even an ROI with a miner. An older low efficiency miner will still mine, but the cost to run the miner could be higher than any returns. IE you might mine $10 worth of bitcoin, but your electric bill will be $15. In this scenario it would have been wiser and cheaper to buy Bitcoin at market value than mine them.
My suggestion for anyone interested in mining is to remember it's a high upfront cost with high risks and not much reward outside of fun hobby/learning. Consider it as a way to slowly purchase Bitcoin through your electric company. You take a risk with spending more than you get back, but have the added benefit of not having to use exchanges or their verification process to acquire bitcoin.

The Chinese trade velocity is much higher than all other exchanges. They also tend to lead the price with a premium anywhere from $20, to $80 during a rally when converted to USD. That's why most people point to the bull runs as being lead by China.

You must live in the US, one of the only places in the world that isn't taught the metric system. Everyone in the world buys and sells in metric, and then has to convert for the US market. We should stick with metric, the scientific, logical measurement system. There's no need to add further confusion to Bitcoin units because Americans don't understand it immediately. That's an education issue, not a problem with a base 10 measurement that allows you to easily calculate it by simply moving the decimal. They understand kilo, mega, giga, tera when talking in bytes for storage. It's not a stretch that they can learn milli, and micro.
Because it's an international standard there is nothing for people to memorize since it's common and well used (outside the US.)

When you don't control the keys, you don't own anything except an IOU from a faceless company. You also need to ask permission from them anytime you want to make a transaction as they control everything. Including the ability to deny, or delay your transaction requests.
Bitcoin is like digital cash and you can think of storing it with the same principles as physical cash. Keeping your money in an exchange or other custodial wallet can be compared to asking someone on the street to hold your physical wallet/cash while hoping they don't disappear or run off.

Mining bitcoin really isn't an option with standard PC hardware.
You can however attempt to mine various alt coins and do what any reasonable person would do, dump them for Bitcoin immediately ;)
However even with altcoins, AMD cards generally perform better. Something like the RX 470 for example would be a great new card that mines decently well but is also capable of gaming. There's currently a resurgence with the older AMD 7950/7970/280x/290/290x cards for mining Zcash as cost of those cards are cheap and perform very well with it's algorithm.
With something like Ethereum, the 950 can get around 10 mh/s, while the RX 470 can get about 26 mh/s. In terms of earnings, which frequently changes the 950 *could* get you around $0.50 worth and cost about $0.30 in electricity per day. The RX 470 could see around $1.37, and $1 after electricity costs.
These numbers are a very rough estimate and are in no way accurate. They also don't take into account electricity usage for the rest of the machine which would further eat away at any profits.
If you are wanting to try your hand at mining, don't expect profits. Instead think of it as a learning tool, or as a way to purchase a tiny amount of Bitcoin per month through electricity costs. Keep in mind, it's almost always easier and cheaper to buy bitcoin directly than it is to try and mine it.

Easiest way would be to just import/sweep then send directly to your HW wallet.
A much more secure method would be to generate an address from your HW wallet. Create an offline secure environment with a bitcoin client. Import the paper wallet, and create a transaction for the exact balance + fee. Save the transaction to a USB and broadcast it on a live system so your private key is never seen by a live system.

@_date: 2017-01-17 04:03:19
Yes you can mine bitcoin without running a node yourself as long as you are using a pool. Pool mining works by having a central node that everyone in the pool connects and mines with. The reward for solving a block is then proportionally split based on work submitted to solving it.
Mining does require a node, but doesn't require that you run it. 
Running a full node does a lot, but it doesn't mine. It validates and propagates transactions and blocks to other peers and maintains a synced blockchain. Mining is the process of adding *New* blocks to the blockchain.

I think he may be referring to using the live site. Your initial post never mentioned obtaining it directly from github, verifying signatures, and then using it on an offline linux live boot disc. 
You also open up a vulnerability window when it comes time to import/sweep the keys to a live wallet. That vulnerability can be managed by importing and creating an offline transaction to a secure wallet where the key was already generated and announcing that transaction online. Preventing the private key from being revealed to a live system at any point.
Also, thousands of coins in 2012? I hope you managed to hold a large portion of them ;)

You can always use BIP38 to encrypt your private keys through bitaddress. Requiring a password to decrypt the private key makes theft less of an issue.
If you want to go the route of physical paper, I'd recommend buying a small fire safe and storing it somewhere hidden.
As long as you trust your password, print off a couple copies and store them in different locations ie with relatives, in a safety deposit box, etc. For privacy, you can remove the public key, leaving only the bip38 encrypted private key.
Also never use the live site to generate your keys. While it's likely safe and secure, it's always better to download and verify the site from their github then move it to an offline secure linux live boot

You are much more likely to click on a fishing link that leads you to something like bIockchain which will drain your funds. Google ads are nefarious for linking to these scam sites.
I'd highly recommend a cold storage option (created, and stored securely) for larger amounts; and a wallet such as mycelium on android for easy access day to day spending. Essentially amounts you normally wouldn't carry with you, keep in cold storage. Amounts you use and don't mind risking (ie: cash in wallet) keep in an active *hot* wallet for easy and quick access.
Bitcoin is not limited to a single wallet. Use as many as you like to spread the risk of one service/device being compromised or failing. Experiment with inconsequential amounts and have fun learning various ways to use, secure, and backup your Bitcoin.

Also regarding that thread; BTC-E had a large amount of ETC replayed and refused to acknowledge it's value.
I'd suspect that *every* exchange has been "hacked" or exploited to some extent but never publicly disclosed. Whether or not they have or should reported it publicly is another issue all together.
An exchange I used a couple years ago (has since been shutdown) had a race condition vulnerability in their trade engine that I accidentally stumbled onto during my regular trading. I contacted their support which presumably had it fixed (I quickly left that site to never be used again.) Regardless of the outcome they never publicly stated an exploit had been found, fixed, or even existed. They offered no bug bounty or compensation to tempt white hats; potentially making it a larger target for grey/black hats.
If I was able to stumble onto it during somewhat normal use, you can bet an attacker searching for an exploit would have already found, and used it.

I know exactly what you mean with ETH and ETC while being seen as a scamcoin, it wasn't a scam in that sense. ETC was the *original* chain in a controversial hardfork. It was no scam and treating it as such was reckless. The hardfork proponents failed to gain complete consensus and forced a hardfork on a divided community. Using scummy tactics like media, pools, and exchanges to push the illusion of consensus assuming all opponents would abandon their position. It's unfortunate the *original* chain lost it's name and had to append classic but it absolutely taught the whole community about some of the risks of hardforking.

No, but it requires a malleability fix to be in place before hand. The longer it take to get Segwit (1 year time out), or another malleability fix upgrade activated. The longer it will take before LN can even be considered.

Breadwallet is an example of a decent wallet where the user remains in control of the keys at all times. You are never reliant on Breadwallet servers/services remaining active as you can move the keys from your backup to another wallet.
Just make sure you've stored your backup seed securely and safely. Your keys exist only on your device, not in the cloud or on a server. If something happens to your device you will need your backup to restore your bitcoins. At the same time, anyone who can get access to your backup seed, can steal your coins. It can become a double edged sword where you need to find balance between ease of recover/use, paranoia, and security that you personally feel comfortable with.

Not questioning your post, but why use NVIDIA as an example? Their competitor AMD has seen more than a 6.5x increase making a $10,000 investment last year now worth more than $65,000 showing a larger disparity between prices. That's not to say other investments could have seen higher gains.

Flip a coin. Let chance decide for you.
If you really need the money, sell. If not let it ride, it can go up, it can go down no one knows which, or when.
You could also sell $400 worth, getting back your initial "investment" then whatever you have left in bitcoin has no initial cost associated to it. That way if it drops you've lost nothing, but if it goes higher you've gained.

I think the general issue as far as a non biased argument is that they take control away from the user.
If you don't control the private key, you don't own the bitcoin.
Other than that there is questionable tracking practices that will see your account closed without notice. This can happen for something as minor as having a transaction tainted after multiple jumps to/from coinbase on a gambling site, or whatever they deem illicit within various jurisdictions. The kyc/aml also seems to be above and beyond excessive at times.

Whichever wallet it is (likely hive as bashco said) consider it compromised. Taking a screenshot of the seed should be considered very insecure. It could have been uploaded to various clouds, accessed by other apps, or just stumbled upon due to it not being encrypted or obfuscated in any way on your device.
Seeing as this is an image of an apparently old wallet that you can't identify I'd say there's an equal chance of this seed belonging to you, as there is that you obtained it going through hacked device dumps.

Good advice, and adding to that; Don't use any wallet where you don't control/hold the private keys.
Take responsibility and learn how to properly secure you keys. Cold storage options can range from cheap and easy paper wallets (use bip 38 for extra points) to hardware wallets at a variety of different prices.

Your employer doesn't need bitcoin. Essentially they send your paycheck to an intermediary, and not you. The intermediary accepts your paycheck, converts it to bitcoin (at a fee) and sends it to you.
There is a lot of risk as you are handing over your paycheck to a third party in hopes that they follow through and give you the Bitcoin.
There are a few services that offer this, but I don't know enough about any of them to recommend them.

Currently the median fee is at $0.13 for a standard size transaction.
Fees are based on the size of the transaction, not the amount. If your $5 has dozens of small inputs (combining multiple small payments transactions such as from a faucet) the size of the transaction will be larger and require a larger fee.
However fee calculations are not always accurate and can be gamed by outside forces. It may be that someone has been pushing multiple large fee transactions in an effort to increase fee estimation within certain wallets.

If the wallet was created prior to core 0.13 the default key pool (pre-generated addresses) is set to 100. Each transaction will generate a new address (change) and every time you request a payment. You should try to maintain a backup every 50 transaction or request for payment address.

Gox had long standing solvency issues which affected withdrawals on both sides, fiat and Bitcoin.
They also had around 75-80% of the global daily trade.
Uncertainty in China (the real reason for the spike above $1000) was the cause for the decline back to levels from 3-4 months prior as those who bought, quickly sold off for fear of regulation/bans.

There likely is some spam, or malicious transactions occurring. Unless that node is the spammer, he doesn't have much control in terms of what transactions appear in his mempool outside of pre-configured filters, fee threshold, etc. 
I'm not well read up on mempool and how transactions propagate the network after their initial broadcast so I can't say too much on that.
It's possible that those 19k transactions with decent fees were *old* and outside of his acceptance setting, or other nodes he connected to were no longer rebroadcasting older transactions. Unless someone actively rebroadcasts a transaction it won't propagate to newly started nodes.
Either way, the chart is absolutely informative, but should be compared and averaged out across multiple mempools. Relying on a single mempool is fine, but may not give an accurate view of the overall network.

Hardfork again to further try and increase blocksize

With softfork's you do as few changes and complimentary additions as you can. Softforks can be rolled out and implemented far easier than hardforks with far less risk. This makes multiple softfork roadmaps a viable upgrade option.
A hardfork you want to do as much as you can, and as rarely as possible. 
A hardfork for a single, small change is not enough. There are entire wishlists of hardfork changes that must be considered. The best way forward is to determine if a hardfork is truly is necessary without being an emergency or crisis. Then implement and test as many improvement changes as possible with the expectation that there will never be another hardfork. Testing is the key here. Potentially years of testing, with equal activation lead time.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:13:35
Hardforking to 2MB is a reckless solution with good intent. It can and should be rejected on the same technical principles that classic was rejected.
It's a hardfork for the sake of hardforking without any technical reason to do so. At the very least the proposal should be revisited several months after segwit has been activated. Only then can we truly determine if a blocksize hardfork is necessary. 
If a hardfork is determined necessary, we need implement and test as many viable items from the wishlist  
Then after several months or more of indepth testing we can consider moving it to the mainnet for signalling with an activation lead time of around 1 year.
This segwit2mb hardfork proposal is attempting to gain market acceptance by bootstrapping the name segwit to it despite having nothing to do with segwit. Among other issues, it does not address the quadratic sighash scaling problem which exists even with 2MB. A *simple*change of a 1 to a 2 is not as straight forward as some believe and comes with it's own set of issues.

The price going up is due to people pulling funds out of the Bitfinex the only way possible.. By purchasing Bitcoin, or other coins they list.
The growing price premium is a decent measurement of the lack of faith users have in the exchange recovering. It shows the losses they are willing to take in order to get funds out of the exchange and as a byproduct increases the price gap a little more each time.
The rest of the exchanges are *not* following bitfinex, they are their own price discovery markets. The collapse of bitfinex would cause some turmoil and a temporary pull back in price. However I don't believe it would be more than 20-30%

You're learning the names of pool operators and ASIC manufactures not individual miners.
Individual miners do exist, but they are absolutely being out competed by large ASIC manufactures that prefer to mine on their own hardware rather than sell it to customers at a *fair* price.
6-10 pools have more than 51% of the hashpower, however they don't necessarily own it. Pools are still, for the most part made up of individual users who point their miners at the various pools.
Centralization of mining is occurring, and ASICs may be partially to blame. The real culprit is a lack of competition in the manufacturing and sales of ASICs to end users. IE why would you sell hardware for less than it can earn if you were to just plug it in.

Every node maintains it's own mempool of transactions. Each following it's own set of rules for accepting, dropping, or rebroadcasting, etc.
Restarting a node will clear that users active mempool. Requiring transactions to be broadcasted again to see them in their mempool. Some transactions may not automatically get rebroadcasted unless requested.
In short, there will always be discrepancies between mempools as users/services/providers that are running their own nodes and crawlers giving them similar albeit different mempools.
What likely happened is node used to provide that data got restarted and had to rebuild it's transaction mempool.

The concept of paper wallets, and that site are legitimate. However there are some caveats and risks you should consider. When used *properly* address generation cannot be tracked, cataloged, linked, or data mined in any way.
First, you shouldn't be generating a paper wallet through the live bitaddress site that you intend to actually use. This can leave you open to MITM attacks, malware, etc always assume the device you're using is compromised and act within your own risk levels. While it may be fine to use the live site, it's better to be safe than sorry.
When generating a wallet that is intended to hold bitcoin try to do it offline and running on a live linux disc to reduce the chances of data leaks as much as possible. You can download bitaddress from their github  Bonus points if you take the time to verify signatures.
While making paper wallets, it's a good idea to enable Bip38 encryption which will require a password/passphrase to be entered when you try to import the private key or move the funds. It adds a welcomed extra layer of protection, just don't forget your passwords. Keep in mind, this is a password only, and not a recovery seed of any kind. You will always need both your password, and the encrypted private key to access your bitcoin. If you use Bip38, consider making at least two prints to store in separate locations in the event that they get lost, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible.
Paper wallets work great, but are somewhat old in terms of secure modern bitcoin storage. Consider a hardware wallet which allows you to easily generate nearly limitless addresses all backed by a single HD recovery seed.
Another quick thing to consider is your printer. Using an ink based printer will cause your wallets to run/become distorted if they get wet. A wireless printer requires sending printer data in a non secure way. Many *smart* printers today have internal storage which keep images of previously printed data. Selling a printer after printing wallets could lead to loss if they are not BIP 38 encrypted.

Segwit only gained support once Luke found a way to implement segwit+blocksize increase using only a softfork. It's here, and has been available for sometime now, took longer due to change to softfork, but HK agreement fulfilled.

As long as individual users are given the choice to view or change to whatever unit they prefer we can keep Bitcoin as the default. We don't need to forcefully change the base Bitcoin unit on the network, sites, or wallets as Bitcoin already uses metric prefixes for easily identifiable amounts.
Bitcoin, decibitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin, satoshi.
I'm all for encouraging sites to enable additional units for personal preference, but forcing a default that isn't bitcoin I disagree with.
If you like, you can also express bitcoin using the tonal system.
Also, for other comments wanting to skip right to μBTC, It's is called microbitcoin. "Bit" is a terrible name for a unit. It causes far more confusion than understanding while metric prefix's are used and understood globally.  It's much better to keep it as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit.
Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.

Without going into any detail and keeping it as layman as possible here is part of it. Keep in mind he casts a long shadow of shady dealings and criminal behavior from his past that I won't touch on here.
In short, his scaling proposal is a coup. He doesn't care about scaling one way or another; it's simply being used as a crutch to gain support. All the while he promotes his own products, site, and pumps altcoins ad nauseam.
His goal is to *fire* and remove all devs and contributors to the bitcoin core client (the open source project that helped build, maintain, and gain community support in bitcoin) and all social media/sites that support core/devs including the mods of this sub. He wants a governance leadership model for bitcoin where he, or an elected individual gets the final say in whether something changed, added, or removed from the protocol.
His motivation seems to result from a personal vendetta against core due to being butthurt when his ideas were rejected years ago. Instead of accepting his flawed ideas and proposals, he doubled down in an effort to seemingly divide the community, and replace all developers with ones he can bankroll, or already the few that already supported him. 
His ideas sounded so great to him, that the only reason they would be rejected is because core had been compromised and is now corrupt, owned, and controlled by the powers that be. Thus here we are today with him trying to destroy bitcoin core, and all it's future development roadmaps.
On top of this, he aligns himself with shady organizations, and lies through his teeth for profit. Notably he stood by Gox when it was insolvent, making a statement that they were solvent and everything was fine. While no way of verifiy, it's likely this statement was part of a backdoor deal for him to get his funds out of Gox while letting everyone else go down.
Don't take this post on it's face value, take the time to look into his past discrepancies and try to identify the reasons for his push to remove/replace bitcoin core. Come to your own conclusions on this *debate*.

I do not support a hardfork in this manner, or as a *compromise*.
With a hardfork you want to do as much as you can, and as rarely as possible.
A hardfork for a single change is not enough unless it's an absolute emergency. 
There are entire wishlists of hardfork changes that must be considered. The best way forward is to determine if a hardfork is truly is necessary without it being an emergency or crisis. Then implement and test as many improvement changes as possible with the expectation that there will never be another hardfork. Testing is the key here. Potentially years of testing, with equal activation lead time.
Pushing a single 2MB hardfork is not a solution to scaling. A harfork is a **protocol replacement**, not a protocol  upgrade.

Coinbase: 


It's a technical term used within within bitcoin, just like blockchain.
Companies that came in *early* stole technical names used within bitcoin for their own name/recognition. I've always been against this, but it seems too late now and only serves to add confusion making coinbase.com and blockchain.info look like integral parts of Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin coinbase, has nothing to do with the coinbase company.
Hmm, thought this was a newb question; Just looked at the link and I see what you mean. Looks like they changed something in their site formatting and accidentally listed every transaction as coinbase, instead of just the first *actual* coinbase transaction.

Select Choose a wallet, it has a list of wallets based on device, and platform. Each wallet will have a basic break down of it's pros and cons.
The vast majority of reliable wallets do not use, or require emails/accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:13:05
First, you shouldn't be generating a paper wallet through the live bitaddress site that you intend to actually use. This can leave you open to MITM attacks, malware, etc always assume the device you're using is compromised and act within your own risk levels. 
When generating a wallet that is intended to hold bitcoin try to do it offline, running on a live linux disc to reduce the chances of data leaks as much as possible. You can download bitaddress from their github  Bonus points if you take the time to verify signatures.
Onto your questions; They are all individual wallets/addresses with no links to one another.
The paper wallet tab allows you to easily generate multiple wallets at once. IE lets say you bought 1 Bitcoin but didn't want to store everything in a single address. Generate 10 wallets, then send 0.1 Bitcoin to each.
Using multiple wallets/addresses is great for when it comes time to pull bitcoin from your paper wallet you don't need to risk your entire savings. There is no limit to the amount of addresses or paper wallets you can have/use.
The site only needs to generate entropy (moving mouse/entering random keys) once. After that every *tab* will work and you will not need to generate any additional entropy.
While making paper wallets, it's a good idea to enable Bip38 encryption which will require a password/passphrase to be entered when you try to import the private key or move the funds. It adds a welcomed extra layer of protection, just don't forget your passwords. Keep in mind, this is a password only, and not a recovery seed of any kind. You will always need both your password, and the encrypted private key to access your bitcoin. If you use Bip38, consider making at least two prints to store in separate locations in the event that they get lost, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible.
Paper wallets work great, but are somewhat old in terms of secure modern bitcoin storage. Consider a hardware wallet which allows you to easily generate nearly limitless addresses all backed by a single HD recovery seed.

If it's not a highly efficient ASIC, you will be mining at a massive loss relative to power consumption.
Even just "testing" a standard a high performance computer will be unable to solve a mining pool share before it becomes stale.
To see how mining works with inadequate hardware, it's best to check out an altcoin with a small network. Otherwise your system will be running at 100% with no results.
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:55:55
Yes. 
ASIC's are able to do one thing, and one thing only. Hash SHA-256 as used by bitcoin. If you change to something other than SHA-256, those ASICS become paperweights. There are some other altcoins that support SHA-256 which would be compatible with existing ASICS, but it's impossible to say what would happen if centralized mining farms suddenly dumped their hashrate on them.
One thing to keep in mind, is that a POW change to prevent centralization can only effectively be done once. Mining after a POW change would presumably be limited to CPU, and or GPU's. As such any change in the future would still require reliance on pre-existing farms. Unless there is some sort of protocol level planned obsolesce in hardware requirements to mine, you couldn't move hashrate away from those mining farms.

I'd argue that it's far worse to undervalue the *ideal* hardfork, and use it a mechanism for frequent, and small changes. 
Every hardfork is fracturing the network and breaking backwards compatibility requiring every user to use only the latest version. This can easily expose entire network to unforeseen bugs, complications, etc in the new codebase as no one would be able to run previous working versions that have been unaffected.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:45:21


It wasn't *fixed,* the network/non-updated nodes rejected the accidental hardfork. The solution was for the miners running the latest version that accepted it as valid to reject the valueless hardfork and revert back to the main consensus chain. The bug that caused the hardfork was then patched and everything continued on as normal.
Despite the emphasis put on the march 2013 fork, it caused minor confusion but was essentially a non-event. An invalid block made valid by an unforseen conflict in code change.

It should work just fine. Good job on keeping backups, although keeping around the unencrypted wallet could a liability if it's still easily accessible.
Keep in mind Core pre-generates a 100 key pool. If you requested/used more than 100 addresses since the backup, those coins won't be in the old unencrypted wallet.
If you do still have issues, there are recovery services that, for a fee will attempt to brute force your password/phrase based on what you remember of it.

Yes, and no. This has been brought up multiple times in the past.
The communication delay is simply too large for bitcoin itself to work.
My general idea would be each interplanetary *sector* would need it's own sidechain/lightning network of sorts that handles all transactions for that day, or however long. Then consolidates all transactions and closed payment channels that occurred to the bitcoin blockchain when it is most convenient to do so.
This could allow for instant transactions while anywhere on world/in sector, but would require a longer initial confirmation delay when traveling based on when the sidechain your funds are held in consolidates and closes that payment channel making them accessible in your current sector.

Outside of general variance and luck.. The network hashrate has increased by a large amount. Looks like a new batch of ASICs are being tested, or added to manufacturers private farms.
The primary ASIC manufacturer is vocally against core. Some have have hinted that it's likely for financial reasons and not technical.
When you control the manufacturing of 70%of the total hashrate; you can put some weight behind your politically chosen *side*.
**UASF is needed.** 
Potentially a POW change is needed as well if they continue to grow at such an alarming rate and become the sole ASIC provider. That would enable them dictate customer priority, and give *political friends* preferential treatment. Turning the network hashrate into a completely centralized mess.

Yes, and the burden of proof is on him. If Satoshi truly exposes his identity it shouldn't and doesn't need to be easily refuted, debunked, or speculated upon.
There will always be doubters no matter what evidence is provided. What we want is as little reasonable doubt as possible. This can be achieved rather easily assuming he actually is Satoshi and maintained some form of access to his early work.
Bitcoin is built on math to eliminate the need for trust... Suddenly the fabled creator returns and his first thought is to ignore the basis of bitcoin and cryptography and instead tell everyone to just trust him.
Yes he can sign block 9, or the genesis and it will signify that he truly is, or has/had some connection with Satoshi (individual or group.) Signing both block 0, block 9, and another later block/address linked to Satoshi shows much clearer that one individual holds all keys. If Satoshi is a group, and Craig is part of it, he may only hold a tiny portion of keys. Perhaps he's the only surviving member of this group seeking the all the glory with no repercussions.
There are many reasons to doubt him and providing a small sliver instead of something massive and concrete will not help his case.

Bitcoin is only divisible by 8 decimal places. Once it reaches .00000001, dividing that by 2 drops it down to 0 reward.

Yes it's possible, the majority of altcoins do just that and claim "ASIC resistant" as a feature. It works by usually requiring a memory intensive algorithm that would vastly increase the cost of producing an ASIC.
If however, an ASIC or even FPGA started getting developed, switching to a new POW would be possible. An additional change would likely be favored by those existing cpu/gpu miners as it wouldn't affect their ability to mine. This effectively creates a large disincentive to spend the necessary millions on research and development. It may not be the most elegant method to prevent ASIC's but it does work. You can take it further, by using multiple POW algorithms, either together, or cycle between them intermittently every *x* number of blocks.

How can you price fees in fiat, when the price of bitcoin is not a constant?
As the price fluctuates the fiat cost of fees does as well despite the same satoshi per byte.
Fees should not be *set* based on price, but rather sat/byte based on demand and available block space. Trying to mandate lowering sat/byte as the price increases, or increasing sat/byte as the price decreases to keep fees always within a fiat range doesn't sound like a working fee market to me.
I'd prefer not to spend more than 1 millibitcoin regardless of the fiat price for an average transaction. However security is worth a fair bit to me, with privacy being worth just as much, perhaps more. I have no problems paying higher fees when block space is in high demand.

First you need to be aware you will likely be flagged for high volume transactions requiring additional aml/kyc and potential regulation issues. This will slow down the setup process and things wont run smoothly at first.
To do what you want, you will need to sign up and get fully verified at a large exchange.
Once verified, you will need to keep a fiat float equal to about 3 business days worth of spending on the exchange.
This is due to the only slow process with purchasing or selling bitcoin is the time it takes to transfer fiat from your bank, to the exchange.
The initial setup process could take a couple weeks, but once you're up and running with a float that meets your needs everything *should* be smooth sailing as withdrawing bitcoin is done nearly instantly. You may run into the rare occasion where you drain the exchanges hot wallet requiring a few hours for them to refill.
You will not be able to purchase bitcoin on credit, or on loan. You will always need fiat on hand within the exchange before an otc or market trade can take place.

Discussion of said "controversial" hard fork was fine when it was just discussion of BIPS and ideology. It became an issue and labeled as an alt coin the moment the hardfork code got added to a client. That client had code designed to divert from bitcoin and was actively being pushed ad nauseam.

Even with security questions, you're still at risk from GPS spoofing. Any question you ask would have to be able to stand up to time, weather, and be somewhat unmovable, otherwise you risk the answer getting lost. Due to the semi permanent nature of the question, a google earth street view could reveal many answers.
I'm sure people will find ways around and stop the cheaters eventually, whether it's placing stones in a pattern, or other methods. Until then it will only take minutes for someone to scan through dozens or hundreds of these locations and check if the answer is easily available.

For many, bandwidth is a limited resource and so are available incoming peer connections slots.
If someone malicious want's to disrupt your altruism of running a node without a full blown DDOS they have limited options. 
What they can do, is take up numerous connections and pull as much of your resources away from legitimate users as they can. If you have a bandwidth cap and they are able hit it, they effectively knock your node offline for the remainder of your ISP's set limit.
Other non-users that tend to use a fair bit of resource are monitoring companies that constantly demands the latest info to try and trace/track user IP's. IE chain analysis.
I block numerous of what I would consider malicious, suspicious, or likely monitoring peers on a regular basis.
I encourage everyone to watch their incoming connections and make their own ban list based on what they deem as malicious use of your resources. Banning tracking companies can also help protect legitimate users privacy. Quick tip, watch for numerous connections from similar or nearly identical IPs. When you find one, disconnect both and see how quickly they reconnect. Instant reconnection are usually a sign of third party software other than a standard wallet/node. Ban them and watch your logs for a sudden spam of connection attempts every couple seconds.
With all that said, if you are fine letting them waste *their* resources, let them. It may help lesser nodes who wouldn't be able to handle their resource demands.

Another question that should be asked; how many of the transactions within any given block had been previously seen in mempools?
It's possible to make these transactions and never broadcast them. Effectively allowing the pool to guarantee they mine back those transaction fees as it wouldn't have been seen on the network by other miners. Doing so could mess with fee estimates that look at the previous blocks average fees.
This may also help with ASICBOOST as well. Using self created transactions you can maintain the appearance of a full block, while including a majority of transactions you created before hand.

Maybe chainsplit isn't the right word. I may be incorrectly using chainsplit and fork terminology interchangeably.
What would you call it when BIP148 activates through a user activated softfork, and some miners non-maliciously continue mining the non-segwit chain? 
To me, I'd call this divide a chainsplit as it creates seperate blockchains one for bip148 segwit, and a second following the old rules. Both could exist without attacking the other. Obviously it's a fork, but with the existence of two chains wouldn't that make it a split?

141 activates when *miners* have mined 95% blocks signaling they are ready for segwit.
148 are node operators and community members saying *screw you guys, I'm activating segwit on August 1st regardless of hashrate/mining power.* 
BIP 148 is guaranteed to cause a chainsplit if segwit is not activated before August 1st as they will reject any non segwit block they see.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:41:00


How would you go about achieving that? The only low risk interim solution is softfork segwit which has been available for sometime now but it's being blocked. 
Other methods that rbtc seem to like require a hardfork. Hardforks themselves are protocol replacement, not tools to implement upgrades. Let alone multiple small incremental upgrades.

I honestly doubt that, the majority of the world uses metric. While the unit bitcoin may throw them off at first, change it to millimeters and micrometers and they will give you the correct answer most of the time. 


You don't need to always use the full 4 syllable name. Did you miss the part in my initial post which goes into how within context you can easily, and naturally abbreviate any of the metric prefix's to one syllable?


That has some truth to it, but I don't see people avoiding gold because they can only afford a few grams, or fractions of an ounce at a time. Everyone likes whole numbers, but subunits psychology works both ways. It not only acts as a psychological barrier, but also as a goal, an ambition, something to strive for to get a whole unit.


Clearly not *everyone*, I'd rather see a unique name for microbitcoin that doesn't have anything to do with the whole unit of bitcoin. Using bit removes the ability to abbreviate bitcoin without confusion.  Why don't we bring back blowstamps as a microbitcoin unit name, seems like a compromise ;)

Check your logs for suspicious/malicious users that may be requesting the same data constantly to try and use up your bandwidth. -logips can help identify users which constantly reconnect and get a new peer id.

It does not need miners to activate. It's part of the code that it will reject all non-segwit blocks on August 1st.
Without miners, it simply fails. Those running the code will split off the network regardless of miner support. If there truly is no miner support, people will turn off their 148 node and slowly rejoin the networks main non-segwit chain.

I've made several transactions throughout the past 48 hours with fees of 65, 100, 150, 200, and 300 sat/byte. All confirmed rather quickly within one or two blocks of each other from initial broadcast.
Looks like high fee spam transactions which contain dust or unconfirmed (likely to never confirm) inputs are effectively messing with fee estimations.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:19:38
The size could be part of the issue, did you attempt to rebroadcast the transaction at all?
One of my 65 sat/byte transactions was rather small and only took 105 minutes.
Another 65 sat/byte transaction I did took about 120 minutes with similar size.
It may not be entirely reliable, but it's not always a long wait.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:09:23
Your bandwidth may handle it, but not much else will.
Your CPU wouldn't be able to keep up with validating blocks at that size. This is especially true if a miner decided to throw in a couple transactions to mess with quadratic scaling issues to gain an advantage over other miners.

No, not really. Anytime a blacklist is made, affected companies/malicious actors change their IP/host provider.
It's best if everyone creates and manages their own list. This will also reduce the chance of a false positive weakening legitimate users/services depending how many run the same list.

Slight copy/paste of my past replies on changing the pricing to millibitcoin or microbitcoin.
As long as individual users are given the choice to view or change to whatever unit they prefer we can keep Bitcoin as the default. We don't need to forcefully change the base Bitcoin unit on the network, sites, or wallets as Bitcoin already uses metric prefixes for easily identifiable amounts.
Bitcoin, decibitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin, satoshi.
I'm all for encouraging sites to enable additional units for personal preference, but forcing a default that isn't bitcoin I disagree with.
If you like, you can also express bitcoin using the tonal system.
As for wanting to skip right to μBTC, It's is called microbitcoin. "Bit" is a terrible name for a unit. It causes far more confusion than understanding. While the existing metric prefix's are used and understood globally. It's much better to keep *bit* as an abbreviation for Bitcoin. This allows a three syllable, easy to say, and easy to recognize units by using prefix + bit. IE decibit, centibit, millibit, microbit.
Within context, the prefix becomes all you need to convey the amount. IE deci, centi, milli, micro which can then be shortened further by dropping the last syllable to dess, cent, mill, mike or mic. All of which naturally derives from the full name.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:31:19
Nice old comment, I'll try and refute/clarify my position as if it was a direct reply.


Sure, but call them what they are: microbitoin, microbit, mics, mikes, etc. Abbreviate the prefix + unit, not the unit alone. Might as well call them *apples* if we are going to arbitrarily pick a name for it. At least apples would add less confusion as it's completely separate from the bitcoin name, or any technical reference used therein.


The satoshi has some staying power, the Finney less so. However they don't fall within the existing prefix system allowing them to have arbitrary names as they aren't trying to replace one.


How is it in "the wrong direction"? Of course it gives the impression of a small amount, it's a fraction of a larger whole. 


Exactly, people abbreviate to cents, not "*dols,*" I'd make the same argument against measuring kilometers as *mets*. 
You abbreviate with the prefix, not the whole unit (**bit**coin.) Have you ever measured capacitance using microferrets? Nearly everyone will refer to *n* mics, not fers. The unit is implied within context.


My argument is not against what unit to see/use. My argument is to 1. Call/refer to subunits by the correct name prefix+unit or an abbreviation within context. 2. Don't force a unit/subunit default change on anyone. Allow every user to customize their personal experience whether they want to see things listed in megabitcoin, kilobitcoin, hectobitcoin, decabitcoin, bitcoin, decibitcoin centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin. If we add an additional decimal place, eventually I'd like to see nanobitcoin.

If you know how to use paper wallets, stick with them. BIP38 paper wallets with multiple copies stored in different locations such as at a relatives, in a safety deposit box, etc. If you're concerned about privacy when storing your redundant backups elsewhere remove the **public** address after funding. Without the bip38 password, no one can identify the address, or the amount stored therein.

It happens, you can also get several blocks mined within a few minutes.
Or maybe it's something more nefarious!?
Transaction backlog was getting low, and low sat/byte fees were getting confirmed quickly. The miners chose to stop mining until fees went back up.
Maybe there was a power outage in china which knocked out a few building, because nothing says decentralization than the 70%+ hashrate running out of a couple warehouses.

There is no issue with coordinating an upgrade in bitcoin. It's been done numerous times in the past. The issue at hand is coming to consensus on the path forward, with technical vs political arguments and a power grab or two thrown in.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:50:20
Perhaps, although this isn't the first time I've done/tested such things. This includes one or two transactions last week as well. Not as low as 65 sat/byte but still well below estimates. Unfortunately I won't be posting any more IDs as they could start to link my purchase history.
The take away from what I'm saying/showing is not to encourage people to make low fee transactions, but realize that fee estimation is not always accurate and can be gamed.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:51:11
Besides the potential for coop, feature creep, untested, rushed code, etc..
A hardfork requires **everyone** to upgrade to the latest codebase. If there is a flaw, an exploit, backdoor, etc it has the potential to lead to an irrecoverable network if it goes unnoticed for too long.
Softforks do not require everyone to upgrade all at once. If a problem arises, the damage control is far easier as there will always be fallback nodes to ensure the network experiences zero downtime.

Most of those transactions are crafted to never confirm, they simply pump the fee estimation.

A bit of both. But realistically, I take no issue with how someone wants to express bitcoin as long as it isn't forced upon the network/wallets/exchanges/users.
I look at it more like a different *language,* the user selects their preferred default and sees everything as that. Someone using a different *language* has it automatically translated into their preferred setting. Neither party needs to understand the others method of counting as the magic of math works like a universal translator.
I do enjoy looking at and trying to wrap my mind around the crazy number systems out there, and I'll say the world *could* have been be a better place if we all used base12 ;)

Similar shit, similar devs, and pushed by the same people/interest groups.
Looks like they are currently working to manipulate the NYA of segwit2x to become their next name change. It will start by demanding/implementing that hardfork comes first and acts as a stepping stone to include their prior proposals.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:12:05
Fees are calculated based on the size of your transaction. More bytes = larger fee.
Segwit rearranges the witness (signature) data in a way that it doesn't count towards total size in the *legacy* 1MB block.
A transaction with it's witness data no longer counted towards its size is inherently smaller. This allows more transactions to fit per 1MB block. However the witness data still needs to be stored by segwit enabled nodes. This is done by introducing blockweight as an additional parameter to increase blocksize while retaining compatibility with 1Mb and only requiring a softfork.
It's not so much a *"discount"* as transactions that utilize segwit take up less room in the 1MB block, the fee per byte remains mostly the same.

This is a not a compromise, it’s a hardfork for the sake of hardforking to please the 'hardfork at all costs/fire core' fetishists.
A *compromise* solution that involves a hardfork at this point will end up taking the worst of both a soft, and a hardforks while vastly limiting their positives. 
With a hardfork you want to do as much as you can, and as rarely as possible.
A hardfork for a single change is not enough unless it's an absolute emergency.
An emergency situation, is one where bitcoin itself has broken down or made end-users vulnerable to an exploit. IE ECDSA or SHA 256 is broken, Remote code execution is found, etc. The situation we find ourselves in today, is by no stretch of the imagination an “emergency” that warrants a hardfork.
For a hardfork to be considered, we must take a look at the many wishlists of changes/improvements that are only possible through a hardfork. 
The best way forward is to determine if a hardfork is truly is necessary without it being an emergency or crisis. Then implement and test as many improvement changes as possible with the expectation that there will never be another hardfork. Testing is the key here. Potentially years of testing, with equal activation lead time.
Pushing a 2MB hardfork is not a solution to scaling. 
**A harfork is a protocol replacement, not a method for frequent or small upgrades.**

Many international keyboards include alt character that have μ. If your keyboard doesn't, using *"u"* works just as well. Going further, it can be typed by **holding ALT, followed by typing "230" then release ALT.**




Sounds a very american problem. They are the standard metric prefixes that have been in use for centuries. There's nothing that needs to catch on or be learned for the vast majority of the semi-educated world. It's taught in school to young children all around the world with an exception to america. Even then, they are taught in math a couple years later. If you find it that hard to grasp you can reliable ignore deci and centi, and still get by with only milli and micro.


Not only is Bitcoin not ready for mainstream adoption, but if it requires *bits* to make people understand then I hope it never reaches mainstream adoption. The word *"bit"* is already far to overloaded with too many meanings. Bitcoin must use pretty weak cryptography, it's cheap at only 256 *bits.*

Good luck on maintaining a private stash. Hard work is relative, I wouldn't necessarily say you did not earn it though. Once again assuming this is legitimate (hard to believe honestly without a signed address or other proof) it was an opportunity that presented itself, and you jumped in. Not everyone can say that, there are thousands of posts with people lamenting that they should have bought in when they first heard of it. Rarely is it the case that someone takes the leap so early into bitcoin.
