Bitcoin address is an irreversible hash of whatever you decided it to be. Apparently there was a service that allowed to use your password as a private key. Someone realized how insecure this is and made software that uses word list to generate addresses and look for them in blockchain.
My theory was that someone would use some sort of prime number. Perhaps I should scan for multiplications of first 50 million primes, but that is hella lot of combinations.

Wasn't there a law recently passed in US regarding this issue?

Centralizing something that was designed to decentralized entirely defeats the purpose.
As someone mentioned before, speed may not be that big of an issue, although I'd like to sea real world working system. If NFC/credit card transaction takes 3-5 seconds and Bitcoin takes 10 - you can forget about it. I've seen coffee shops not accepting credit cards at all just because at peak times that would mean just ridiculous loss of revenue.

Yes! I remembered word 'solution' though, so thats how I got there.

Was the brute-force attack vector even confirmed by anyone?
It could by related to recent Russian 'leak' of GMail passwords. Turns out it's just bunch of passwords collected off the web and database dumps from torrents.
I think what really happened was a combination of different information sources on very targeted attacks. Wouldn't be surprised there was some Russian government involvement. Remember they are trying hard as fuck to start WW3 and lots of ideological crap is being spilled by the second.

And that's only in US. And that's why Russians are laughing their asses off making billions off US banks/citizens.
Chip cards have actual mini computer inside with some sort cryptographic key embedded in memory. You don't access the key, but just a hash of it. A bit like Bitcoin, really. Same with NFC. Otherwise it would be terribly insecure.

What an idiot. 99.99% of the world can't use Bitcoin, because nobody accepts Bitcoin.
And more like 99% wouldn't be able to use Bitcoin because it's just not secure enough for them. Also the speed of transactions is a joke.
Remember, Bitcoin only has two fairly weak advantages of being decentralized (aka massive cost) - irreversibility and semi-anonymity. These points are completely irrelevant for a payments system you'd want to use daily for buying groceries.

No, not really. The only thing that is different is different authentication method.
With Android you had to enter pin/password - no real advantage against traditional credit card PIN. With ApplePay you shave off few seconds.

To the card company - yes. But you are probably uploaded some very long random string onto your card, that spews out a hash, which then only the bank is able to verify.

Forget magstripe, that is irrelevant. The process is not unique. The key on your card is unique. You can retrieve it by solving memory module in acid and then using electron microscope to peek into actual bits on the silicon.

iPhone 4S is 4 years old. That is massive for tech. There are (used to be?) bunch of people updating their laptops every 2 years. And keep in mind that laptops are order of magnitude faster. Add the mobile software evolution (or Gates law) and you are stuck with the device that is just to slow to cope. Needless to say I will be upgrading my 4S in few minutes to iOS 8 and have no plan to upgrade to newer iPhone. Unless I start learning Swift language.

Bitlocker is only available on pro versions though

I came looking for this as well.
Gavin reiterated his position on twitter and other press channels. 
How come nobody from Bitcoin foundation called him and asked "Are you out of your fucking mind?"
Separately on the Wright story, the only thing that makes sense to me now is that he lost his keys. If I lost keys for millions of dollars I would probably try to exit it gracefully, just as Satoshi did. And try not to loose my mind. But it might creep up on you so you'd desperately try to get it back. Hence, he might have convinced Gavin he is the real Satoshi in alternative ways. Or that is what he wants us to think.
