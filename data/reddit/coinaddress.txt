Nice idea! Thanks for the feedback. Now I just have to figure out how to code it :-)
I was thinking of adding more markets too but the main idea is to keep it simple and clean. I leave it open and can see from anywhere in my lounge what the price is doing without having to go sit at the PC. The price will turn RED when it starts to drop, making it even more obvious.
Do I add more currencies too? or GBP, EUR and USD is enough?

It's from Bitcoinity.org but I pull it as an image not an API feed as this saves extra loading time on each page refresh.

I run it on a second screen next to my PC - so I can watch the price trends all day.

simple Bitcoin Ticker, looks good in Full Screen mode (F11) on a spare screen.

That's OK, I'll just be happy if people use it as took me ages to figure it all out as I'm new to coding with APIs. Even if they don't it works great for me. Check the "get the app" link to the (free or paid version) iPhone app, it uses the same view so it gets familiar to check your phone or your PC seeing the same layout.
I have added the latest price into the browser Tab so if you have multiple tabs open while you are surfing you can still keep an eye on it without going back to the page. Thanks to  for the suggestion.

Thanks for all the comments, I will look into each one of them and try to make improvements, especially the Ajax one - I have never coded in that so I guess I have some research ahead of me unless someone can give me more guidance?
I am a self-taught coder so not a professional developer so I am sure there are loads of ways to do things better but it works for me as a good way to watch the price trends and I'm happy about what I was able to achieve. Looks good on my Ipad too.
I now own bitcointicker.eu if you want to go straight to the EUR currency page.
I also made a Blog / Help page for it behind the scenes:
