No, structuring is only illegal if you are trying to avoid mandatory government reporting, which is $10,000 in the US.

You do realize calling something superior is still a subjective opinion?

I don't think you are factoring in risk.. You act as if investing is risk free.

at 4% just link your bank account to coinbase and buy BTC with  your earnings at 1%

I see. This is why it says any real bitcoin address is invalid?

Thank god I refunded when they first starting shipping a month ago

Umm.. if you have $1mil in your PayPal account it costs $0 to move it to your bank account. You would only be charged $29,000 (2.9%) if you received $1mil from a credit card transaction...this is a pretty standard rate.

Anddd here is where he first fucked up (originally used his real name as his username with his gmail account tied)...

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say he can't legally be tried for the reviews. There is no physical evidence to substantiate the claims that he actually sent those people drugs..he could alternatively say he made the reviews to fake his ratings to look like a more reputable dealer.

I think this a fairly distorted view of what it means to be "useful" to society. is totally right to suggest that the end of money is the true start of freedom. Take for example a stock trader who makes his money day trading. Is that person doing anything useful for society other than playing the system? How about Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine? He refused to patent his work, because he believed in helping others and missed out on billions of dollars..was he not useful to society? Or how about your average McDonald's employee..one could argue that they are proving their worth to society by working some shitty dead-end job with no future growth prospects, but ask them how they feel and they'll tell you how badly they wish they could be doing something more fulfilling with their life. Money is the chains preventing greatness. Whether that greatness is proven to the world or just yourself, it doesn't really matter in a self-sustaining society. The fundamental key to life is happiness! And achieving that is noble in-itself.

Peak oil. Plant fertilizer, tractors, and transportation of produce all require oil..Better start to learn how to grow food yourself

When you swipe your debit card at McDonald's (or any similar charge) you are processing the transaction as a if it were a credit card..The money isn't taken out of your account instantly, but takes a few days to process

We all hope..
But you're probably right. I still think a lot of people are catching on to BTC and that the bubble will take a while to pop. My guess is it will max around $400, but who knows.

Just finished Snow Crash today..would love to be able to send him some BTC for such a great read

@_date: 2013-10-14 01:21:19
While he only briefly spoke about Bitcoin, you can tell he's a great thinker which gives me confidence in the fact that he views Bitcoin so highly
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:34:36
You know that when you sign up, each account (or at least mine) is given $1000 CAD, which can then purchase BTC and the transaction completes automatically...however you cannot send your bitcoins to another address..I assume this is all for testing purposes, but I could be wrong/$1000 richer?

It doesn't really sound like that guy understands the principles of Bitcoin very well..

oh dear god..is that pin on a fedora?
@_date: 2013-10-08 02:47:15
I think they could charge him for those purchases that they made because there *is* physical evidence..I don't think the reviews by themselves are enough for a conviction
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:39:51
I'm curious to know what happens if you already have a coinbase account and receive a tip..does it ask you create a new account with the option of logging in?
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:02:09
So at 1 million shares trading at ~$20 per share, how many bitcoins do you think they have in the trust? My guess is 1 share is ~0.05BTC

Good advice. I cancelled my order days before they started shipping the first batch of Jalapenos and I couldn't be happier with that decision..I still wouldn't have my miner today if I had kept my order open and now getting a refund seems way more complicated.
TBH they were pretty nice about refunding my order. I told them I was moving and needed the money and they processed my refund in a couple of days.

When it worked for me on Monday it was around 8pm EST

Just wait till it surpasses it's previous all-time high from April, the amount of press and ensuing people trying to buy is going to be overwhelming
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:50:01
Doesn't this have the potential for abuse? Let's say I set up a coinbase account and then refer myself with a new account, buy a bitcoin, transfer it to another new account and then sell the bitcoin. I would make $20 through referral rewards just doing that, right?

I think even looking at mt gox throughout it's entire history on a logarithmic scale is a pretty telling chart as well..the three main peaks are from this past spring, the forbes and gawker articles written in spring of  2011, and the slashdot appearance in February of 2011
