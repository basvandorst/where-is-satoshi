Funny that all your comments say that the "bubble will burst" and yet, you are still here on r/bitcoin.
Get a life kid. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:00:47
I am aware the fees are a big problem. What I don't like is people that know only one think: To complain . I've made posts a while ago, abot setting your own fees and such. Most of the people, are to lazy to actually do someting, and they just sit and cry about the fees. That's my problem.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:30:35
I have no problem with the post.
I have a problem with your comment who can only talk about "high fees" . I'm just tired of all this people who have nothing constructive to say.
Yea, thx for the downvotes. Really shines some light on the general opinion.

@_date: 2018-01-08 10:57:35
Try to use electrum. Set your own fees.
When I'm buying things online,if the mempool is full, I just set a low fee of 0.3 , 0.6$ .  I had it pass in 5-6 hours. 
But yea, I'ld agree about some part of what you said. Steam removing Bitcoin option was a bummber for me as well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:23:24
I don't say there isn't a fee problem. 
I'm saying be patient, there's still much work to be done, and in the meantime, adjust your fees.

They are mad cause their "spiritual leader" dosen't get what he wants from Bitcoin, so he made a new coin.

Around for 8 years ? yes.
a "handful of developers" in contrast with the big industies.
Yes, it still is in its infant stages. blockchain as a tehnology.
Wallets push eachother higher in higher == Wallet A checks the medium transaction fee that is going on , and sets a fee close to it --&gt; that increases the medium transaction fee --&gt; Wallet B check the medium transaction fee and sets a fee close to it. .. Can you see where this is going?
Even if the ONLY problem would be the 1MB block limit, even increasing this, is not viable on a global scale. We need Long term , off-chain sollutions.

You are just proving my point..to many people only complaining and waiting for IMEDIATE results without actually doing/saying something helpful.
I guarante you that 60% of the new people coming in don't even know they can set their fees in some cases.

All inovative things take a while to learn, to find the right way to do it, and so on.
Bitcoin is no exception from that rule.
First time i tried to buy bitcoin, it took me 2 days (with all the steps: research about it, searching a vendor, making a wallet and so on)
Now when I buy bitcoin, it takes me 30 seconds.
The point is , again, like all great things, don't give up on the first try.

Well, truth be told, the BCH guys started all the "network is so slow" propaganda, while spamming the network with transactions, and mining empty blocks just to make their point, of upgrading the block size..which will eventualy lead to a weakness in Bitcoin ecosystem, but hey! short term profits for them..
See where I'm getting with this? 
Maybe 70% of the people that follow/support BCH , really think it's the right way. I have nothing agaist them.
My problem is with those who try to mess with this fragile environment, for their own selfish gains. Also with liars , manipulators.

First of all. Don't provide aditional details about your life. Never do that on the internet. 
Second of all, you should join an exchange and sell a little part of it . pay your debts, buy something for the kids. nothing flashy.
Third of all. Make a lot of back-ups, you are sitting on quite the gold mine.. You would hate for them to be lost.
Second of all, transfer lie 0.7 on a diffrent wallet, and depending of the age of your children, tell them about that Bitcoin , teach them how it works, to the best of your understanding (Like: hey kids this is digital money, look how you can send them) . It's a big enough amount to get their interest up, and a small enough amount not to make them go crazy about all the richnes you currently have.
Last of all. Congratz on that!

get Electrum, set your custom fees, you can pay like 0.2 USD per transaction. If you store them in paper wallets no need for bigger fees, as the speed is not an important factor for you.

@_date: 2017-09-06 09:26:35
Well, quite easy, in my opinion.
I buy BTC, and when I need to buy something with BTC, I do it. Most times, I buy at the dip, and buy items with it after it goes up a few $.  Sometimes I use it immediately. Either way, most of the time I'm on a profit , the merchants usually convert it right away, so there's no loss for them, there's no loss for me. So far so good. 
And yet, I agree with you, it can't be considered a M1 currency yet. And that's a good thing. Bitcoin is barley 8 years old..This things take time..so far ..so good :)

For particular reason i can't disclose how BTC (as a currency) helped me and my family..suffices to say i'm eternally grateful.
As an investment, is not bad either. Especially when you consider the fact that you help the thing that helped you.

Basically they made a tons of transactions , to clog the network, and raise the fees.. They wasted some money on this but, since they were also miners, a part of the fees went back to them . Not to mention the fees that everyone else was paying, since most wallets used higher fees to be in the first rows.
Then, they came and singed and dance on their stage of "omg bitcoin so slow, so expensive, come join our new bitcoin, the real bitcoin" (that alt-coin).
By default, I had nothing with them, live and let live, but, since they are using such shity tactics, of spreading Fear in the interest of manipulation, they lost my default.

@_date: 2017-09-21 12:53:55


-Instant transactions?
that's utility right there.


    Prices are relatively stable
    It can be bought, held, retrieved and sold back with relative ease
* Price relatively stable because it has been around for thousands of years.. Bitcoin just for like...8?
* Same as above + show me how you run with gold in the event of an Asset forfeiture by the state.


Well yea, it's not adopted by big vendors yet. We are still in the 'baby steps' phase.


I'll agree with this, but like it or not, greed is what brings most of the people here..as it grows it willl get more stable.


I'll take this this as an insult to math..


    Transaction speed
    Transaction cost
Listen up shitheads, how many times do I have to see the "omg 1$ fee for a cup of coffe" ..there have been some bumps in the ride, now it gets better.. Jesus

I find this to be the perfect explanation: 
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:10:03
I highly doubt someone sending 18.500 BTC, not bothering to check the address .. Or even send in batches. 
The one who claims this didn't even bother to show proof.
Besides...he asked on Quora...
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:03:22
Well yes, but it can be traced far better than normal cash.
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:07:12
*Why walk when you can ride?*  - quote from a great game.
When you transfer them bitcoin, use Electrum's advanced settings -&gt; set custom fee. 
Send one transaction with normal fee, also send one with a low fee. Use this to explain fees to them, also they might get quite a blast (I hope) seeing fees as low as 0.3$

You could use the search function in this place, this has been asked and posted hundreds of times.
Just saying, if you wanna start a business, try to get yourself up and running. Learn to search, look around. 
You won't get far by being passive.

I'm really sorry you can't see the greatness of it. Having a trustless system is what makes the difference.

@_date: 2017-10-26 10:33:40
technically 21 BTC will never be mined.
Anyway, they will work for fees. 
But, In my vision by the time we get close to that, we will have lots of devices minning bitcoin , powered by solar power alone.

Surprisingly not many people know about it. Some have heard of it, but very little are actually using it. I can't even paint you this picture, but out of all the people connected to the traditional monetary system less than 1% deal with Bitcoin or any other crypto right now.
But little by little things change.

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:12:12
trustless as in there's no middle man between you and the person you send bitcoin to. Either you have it, either he has it. 
It is true that you place your trust in the bitcoin protocol, but that's open source, and it's ruled by mathematics and code. The first one is an universal truth , the second one, can be reviewed and such, is not prone to human error, nor is gonna try and steal your money.
By the way of words you choos to describe the fact that you "implemented from scratch and run bitcoin mining pools" , smells like supreme arrogance to me. Anyhow, it dosen't matter. Be the person you wanna be.
All the arguments about block size, segWit, etc, are about diffrent opinions of improving the code. 
You are right about the fact that people should back up their comments. Should have done that, but usually I write while moving from place to place, and it's hard to write a lot .
And nobody said it is magical but it is pretty great considering the fact that it is the first system of it's kind.

Sorry for the stupid question but, wasn't a block mining time 10 minutes ?
Or am I confusing things ?
