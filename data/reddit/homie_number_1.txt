You are right about "incentivizing spending". But IMHO the real point is how deflationary system cause people to have 'too much' monetary incentive to not spend. Some People could/would skip things like insurance, healthier stuff, safer stuff. The tendency could be to take a risk now and spend when btc is more valuable.   
I am not saying the current inflationary system is better, but that a deflationary system will come with its own sets of problems

Complete and uninformed bullshit . Loads of currencies are compared to dollars and other currencies. The high upvotes to this comment suggest to me a shilling campaign here.

17 years ago the visionary had the guts to call linux cancer and now linux has spread to even you smartphones. If that isn't cancerous I don't know what is.

BITCOIN NEEDS TO BE DECENTRALIZED AND STABLE ABOVE EVERYTHING! 
Its super simple logic. Even minor changes can have DEVASTATING CHANGES that may effect the decentralized and stability of bitcoin. Going very very slowly is the only/right approach.

r/bitcoin you are getting wayy too defensive. Instead of trying to find ways of improve something OR point out flaws in OP's understanding (if any, I dunno) most of the answers are 'everything has flaws, don't use it, YOU ARE WRONG!! ' These are very unhelpful and arguably downright harmful.

well, yeah there is crazy amount fud about bitcoin. fudsters even bought bitcoin.com and twitter's bitcoin handle just for spreading their lies. 
BUT OP is still just asking questions. If OP is misinformed, he could be told/linkedTo how it actually works, instead of 'you-are-wrong'. If not, the noob googles and reaches bitcoin.com and stays misinformed. 
I would explain if I knew myself

Got a chance to stop a harmful parasitic scam ?  Lets r/niceguys it!   
I mean seriously, what the hell is wrong with you all  ? forgotten the paid shilling ? the buying out of bitcoin twitter handle, the [bitcoin.com]( lies.  The I sent my coin from bcash address to electrum ? faketoshi . 
Yes lots of people will go down with it. But that is unavoidable. bcash goes down today or in 5 years, gullible will go down with it, more later probably.  They have already poured their life savings in it.
