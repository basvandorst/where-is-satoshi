You still have to pay taxes. It's the law.
If you are using bitcoin to dodge taxes, that's a crime.
Taxes are used to help poor people buy food and allows mothers to buy formula for their infants. 
They repair roads and build community centers.
Yes, your taxes may be used for bad things, but they are used for good things, too.
What kind of horrible, one-sided world would we live in if we only funded what our limited knowledge of the global stage told us we should fund?
What kind of crisis was averted by the Fed's huge loan the other day? The money was gone for literally hours and the world is better off for it.
You would rather see people starve than suffer a little inflation?
The people who divy out taxes are smarter and better informed that most people. Your stance on taxes and your punctuation skills both suggest that you are not fit to tell them otherwise.
Have you considered a credit union? I have had an account with a credit union for years and have actually made .03 USD in interest. (That's a penny every year.) 
It's free because it's a collective.
As an aside, the Fed is actually supposed to help keep inflation down.
It's also not 'super inflationary'. Look up international and historic inflation rates. You are creating a situation in which your beliefs are the clear choice. The facts will contradict this.
Also, if you look at the cost of bitcoin from November 13 to January 14, it looks like a super-inflationary currency. (heh)

True, but this is talking about debt.
Transactions are a very different animal than debt.
See how on money it says "This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private"?
That means if you owe somebody money, they must accept US legal tender as payment.
They are allowed to accept other forms of payment, but they must take US dollars.
It's the subtle difference between a loan/true debt and cost/transactional charges.
This means that a bank must, legally accept US dollars as payment for a loan.
How is that a bad thing?

Bitcoin will likely be valuable first in places with wild currency fluctuations. 
--Bitcoin will have to get its wild flucations under control first.
People all over the world want this technology
--Citation needed
he internet will allow us to connect millions of people to causes- and Bitcoin (or Dogecoin) will allow people to give small amounts (like $1-$5)
--This is somewhat untrue. Do you remember President Obama's first and second campaign? They accepted small donations via online payments and via cell phones.
    If you look at the numbers from those donations, it just doesn't add up to very much. You can also look at breakdown by demographic and see that there was very little interest in people who actually had money to give.

First comment:
"What does this digital money do that my regular money doesn't?
Excellent question. Banks are considered safe because they're insured by the FDIC, and because they've got a really good track record. Not to mention that it's just empirically hard to rob a bank. Credit, usually being an extension of a bank, is also very secure. People have problems with their credit accounts all the time, but that's nothing new, and there are well-established procedures for working out those problems.
I have a couple of cards in my wallet, and with them I can buy just about any product or service in real life, over the phone, or on the Internet. For managing my actual physical money, I log on to my bank's web site. As far as I'm concerned, "digital cash" is here."

No. The concept is valuable. The coins? Worthless.
It's hard to explain. Firstly, I am of the opinion that only food is intrinsically valuable. Everything else is extra.
However, others do not share this opinion.
I think a good way of describing it is "An object that has value that is separate from the current market price is intrinsically valuable."
Gold is intrinsically valuable because it has a real world use. Even if gold were the most abundant substance on earth, it would be useful due to its resistance to corrosion.
The ability to transfer wealth easily is not unique to bitcoin. Any of the altcoins can do that.(With faster confirm rates)
Therefore, all of the altcoins have the same intrinsic value.
This is especially true if bitpay and other payment overlords start taking all cryptocurrency. The only advantage of bitcoin at that point would be the name recognition.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value because it is not special. It doesn't do anything unique. I could spend an hour tonight and create my own altcoin that has all the same properties of bitcoin.

The rise of bitcoin has actually been pegged pretty well with the fall of silver.
It's interesting. I wonder if people who buy bitcoins are selling their silver to do so?
Either way, I rather enjoy the price drop. Makes trips to the coin shop much more fun.
Oh, and tulips also used to cost more than gold. 
Your metrics need to be in usage, not value. Value is meaningless in this context.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:39:43
That's stupid.
The very nature of bitcoins require that they be purchased at some point or another.
There are a few people that mine them, but the majority purchase them.
Heck, you probably purchased them, too.
Currently, it's just an easily traded commodity. 
I guess I will equate it to gold and a canadian dollar.
Is the value of gold measured relative to the US dollar? Yes. 
If I price something in grains of gold, I will have to constantly adjust my prices to ensure I get the proper US dollars for something.
Is the price of a canadian dollar measured relative to the US dollar? No.
If I live in canada and price my good in CAD, I will only have to adjust my prices to compensate for inflation and supply chain costs.
If you can find me a single store that prices their goods in bitcoin and adjusts the dollar amount, I would be amazed.
Think about it. I charge .1 bitcoin for unicorn feed.
In the morning, that means one bag of feed costs 84USD. In the evening, one bag costs 123USD. That's no way to run a business.
That is the difference between a currency and bitcoin.

If you look at the other crypto-currencies, they are also rising. 
However, some of those virtual curriencies are totally worthless.
Infinitecoin has gone up like 500%, despite having no use.
Namecoin has gone up like 2000%, despite being useful to a very small portion of the population.

Actually, that's wrong.
The US didn't have fiat currency until the 60s. That was when coins became cupro-nickel instead of silver and bills were no longer silver or gold certificates.
Did you ever wonder why the USA 5 cent piece is not made of silver?
It's because people were hoarding them back during the civil war when the 5 cent coin was silver. The US govt needed a denomination that was going to be spent instead of saved.
Do you know why the rest of the coins are no longer silver?
It's because people were hoarding them and there weren't enough in circulation.
Bitcoin started its life as a 'hoard, don't spend' currency. If the US currency couldn't pull itself out of this hoarding epidemic, why do you think bitcoin will?
People hoard things of value. The US has been exploiting this since the 1860s to get people to spend money.
Fiat money works because people can't be expected to refrain from speculation.
As a side note, I would like to challenge your 'issued to fund wars' statement. I'm sorry to be rude, but there is no way you can actually believe that.
The first 2 World Wars were funded using 'non-fiat' currency. Every dollar spent during those wars was backed by silver or gold.
FDR saved the economy by taking the US off the gold standard. (Please note, this statement is only supported by fact. The libertarian drivel you like is going to say the opposite.) 
"Taking the dollar off gold provided the second leg to the dramatic change in sentiment… that coursed through the economy that spring. … During the following three months, wholesale prices jumped by 45 percent and stock prices doubled.  With prices rising, the real cost of borrowing money plummeted. New orders for heavy machinery soared by 100 percent, auto sales doubled, and overall industrial production shot up 50 percent."

You return the following day and are then in possession of the desired bumload of silver. After you die, you greed heirs don't need a password or computer to steal it from your bedside.
Honestly, though, there are silver based stocks and investment portfolios that regularly include precious metals.
No, you can't send them to your friend across the world in 10 mins.
You can, however, paypal gift him the money instantly. There are no fees for adding money from a bank account and no fees for sending a gift.
(just kidding, I hate paypal.)
I guess my thought is this:
The ability to send bitcoins quickly is a nifty feature of your binary commodity.
At the end of the day, it makes it useful for transactions. 
It does not remove all ties to other commodities. It expands the market immensely, but it doesn't modify it.
There is always local silver. People in China can buy silver and people in the US can buy silver. 
It is true that people in China are not buying the same silver as people in the US, but they are both still effecting the same silver market. Demand in China raises the price in the US, even if there is little chance of US silver making its way to China. (It's actually very likely, but whatevs)
A buy order for, say, gold in China effected gold prices the same way China's current demand for bitcoins is messing with the market.
People in the US and China are buying the same bitcoins. That doesn't make the market different from silver.

What happens to the money after I've sent it, but before the other guy receives it?
On the topic of fraudulent transactions:
Will the transaction remain at zero confirms, or will it give an error?

I'll admit that that particular comment was a bit silly, but I am serious about it.
Also, the US has *never* seized gold. *never.* People who tell you otherwise are just trying to get you to hate the "big, bad government."
You are dead wrong.
I actually do not store wealth in PMs and I have advocated that people not do so. The high silver prices in the 80s(due to lack of government control) caused millions upon millions of historic coins to be melted.
Even the most precious coins were not worth the silver they were minted on. 
As such, lack of government regulation is a direct cause of the great silver melt of the 80s. Better control over the attempted monopoly would have prevent economic instability.
I would also like to argue about the cause of the Great Depression.
Nobody really knows why it started. There are theories, but you can't point to a single event and call it the cause.
Libertarians like to say the Fed caused it because Libertarians dislike the Fed. Simple as that. Look at the Wiki article:
Right in the intro it has a few major theories about how the GD started. 
You hate the Fed, you blame it for everything.
Neither of us actually understand economics. I think that is the root of our problem. You believe people who tell you what you want to hear.
The Fed was created right before the Great Depression. You hate the Fed. You then make the leap that the Fed caused the GD.
Post hoc ergo propter hoc.
As an aside, deflation occurred during the GD. How is bitcoin deflating(ie mirroring US currency during the GD) a good thing?

A decision made by the collective creates the maximum net benefit for the majority.
The collective is stupid and short-sighted.
I like to cite The West Wing in examples like this. You can see the delicacy of politics and why everything isn't black and white.
How's this for a sample poll in you theoretical colective:
Would you like to kill all the poor people in order to lower taxes?
The poor people would vote no. The people who want lower taxes would vote 'yes'. How is killing the poor people going to benefit society?
We need a group of experts who can weigh all possible outcomes and decide on what will be best. That's the whole idea behind our government.
You and I are not qualified to make important, long term decisions. 
The collective is stupid. So is the market. 
We decide on a few experts who we hope can make the best decisions for the majority. It's how our republic works. 
I would honestly like a well thought-out response about how just because a lot of people make a decision, it makes the max net benefit. I think the idea is laughable.

Well, look at the sub-committees and other similar organizations in Washington.
Why does the president have a cabinet? Because he can't possibly be an expert on everything.
Think back to your bitcoin hearings. Think about the people that testified. They either were experts or had assembled a group of experts in order to make informed testimony.
(Disclaimer: I haven't actually watched the hearings)
I agree that the people we elect are not experts in anything except getting elected. However, I believe that they know how to use resources to make decisions better than we do. They also have access to people they can talk to to become better informed.
Also, I am silver_bubble. Not silverbubble.

I read it. People were supposed to give up their gold.
It's not like people where having their homes searched and having their gold seized.
Yeah, it was illegal to have over 7800USD in gold. That's it.
It's not like it was theft. The government bought the gold at the market price.
Do you know what would have happened if the govt hadn't purchased the gold?
The govt would not have re-valuated the gold, meaning that people who sold their gold to the govt weren't out anything.
The gov't took the gold to prevent people from becoming rich off of the change.
Also, people had a sense of duty back then. I think we can both agree that the revaluation of gold helped the economy. 
The people back then may not have liked the policy, but I like to think they were able to see the benefit.

You people keep calling me an idiot. Saying that I don't understand. That I'm brainwashed, yet you provide little evidence to your defense.
I want a legitimate debate on this. I want somebody who can defend their position so I can better understand your though process.
Yes, I think you are wrong. That does not preclude us having a reasonable debate on this. 
How about some incentive?
If you (or anybody) will debate me, I will buy .01 BTC.
That's right. If you debate me, I will invest in your ideals.
Okay. So, you make 10 posts, I make 10 posts. It must be a coherent debate. You post, I reply, you reply, etc.
Here are some guidelines:
-No name-calling.
-No insulting.
-All posts must be at least 250 words.
-All posts must include at least one scholarly citation. Wikipedia does not count. -Neither do personal websites.
If I break these rules, I will buy the bitcoin before our debate is over. If you break these rules, you donate a dollar to the Democratic party.

I would like to preface this by saying that I do not own bitcoins and I am really apathetic to them.
Anyway, I collect coins. A part of that is watching the silver market.
I watched the rise and fall of silver over the past couple of years and see the same type of comments here about bitcoin.
Silver followed a very slow bubble pattern over the last few years. It started out at 8USD in Nov 2008 and peaked at about 50USD in april 2011. It is now down to 20 or so USD (per ounce).
When Silver was rising, fellow coin collectors had a few things to say:
(most of these quotes are from coincommunity.com)
"Silver has been undervalued since the 1980s. It is just now correcting. Expect 100 an ounce silver before 2013."
"Silver is inherently valuable and will continue to rise as the US dollar weakens."
"The days of cheap silver are over."
Silver is a good cautionary tale to everybody on here. Look at the charts and look at the comments about silver. It mirrors bitcoin.
My personal opinion having watched the silver bubble?
I never believed silver would stay sky-high and I was right.
However, I never expected it to reach 50USD an ounce, either.
With that in mind, people still have the chance to make a profit, but bitcoin isn't going to stay high.
People told me I was stupid during the silver bubble. Some of those people made tons of money. Others lost thousands.

This is not anti-bitcoin.
I'm curious about why you like bitcoin better than collecting coins.
A coin is a beautiful thing. They are marvelous works of art that happen to have a denomination.
For example, I currently have this beautiful coin sitting next to my computer. It is a 90% silver half dollar from 1943. Absolutely stunning. It's probably MS-64 or 65.
I have no idea what its worth. I paid a tidy sum for it 8 years ago. It's probably worth more now.
However, I don't care what its worth! Not one whit! It's a beautiful coin and that's what I like it.
On the other hand, people collect coins that are sealed in these neat little holders. 
They are labeled with all relevant information, including quality.
You can buy books that say an example of X coin graded by Y company is worth Z dollars.
You have the grey sheet that tells you the value of ungraded coins, as well as how to grade coins.
So, you have 2 sides. 
Side A is people, like me, who like to look at the shiny coins.
Side B is people who only buy graded coins for book value.
You seem to have book knowledge about coins, but where is your heart?
Are coins worth something to you just because they are worth something to other people?
Are you a robot?
Coins are meant to be appreciated and loved. From the beautiful *ping* of a silver coin dropped on a counter to the fascinating history of the 3 cent piece (It's so you could buy a stamp with one coin.), coins are something of beauty. 
There is no beauty in bitcoin. You can't hold a bitcoin. You can't admire a bitcoin. 
I love my coins and I hope my (theoretical) children will love them. I hope to one day explain the history of the collection some mildly interested grandchildren.
Coin collecting is beautiful and wholesome. 
To compare it to the impersonal numbers of bitcoin is unfathomable.
Is watching numbers on a screen really more interesting than holding history in your hand? Bitcoin is a method of wealth transfer. Coin collecting is a different animal.
"We do not own coins. We merely curate them until our time is up."
You can like bitcoins and you can like coin collecting, but the 2 have different goals and are not mutually exclusive. 
Now, go buy an Ike and forget about this novel method of transferring wealth for a while.

When the Dollar first came out?
I'm not sure I understand your sentiment. The history of US currency is not as simple as you are. There were a few iterations before anything resembling the modern system came to be.
"In Africa the number one currency there is phone cards. Do you see the potential? Phone cards. Third world people have cell-phones. You can use Bitcoins with cell-phones. Are you starting to see a picture?"
[citation needed]
Is a bitcoin as useful as a phone card to them?
"When the dollar first came out it was not widely accepted and very few merchants took it"
[citation needed]
