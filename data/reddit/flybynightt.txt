Can someone ELI5 what's happening in this clip?

Oh for fucks sake you hadn't gotten me in nearly a month.

The forks? Like I said I'm brand new to this (like I bought 15$ worth of BTC on Thursday and I'm trying to learn the lingo and the ins and outs of it so that I actually know what I'm doing) so I'm not even sure if OP's image is worth noting.

I invested 15$ because that was easily affordable and it would get me started, I'm getting to know about it now. Worse comes to worse, if I'm unhappy with it, it's just 15$. I probably would've spent it on fast food anyways.

Going through Coinbase or other big trusted sellers should ensure that they are BTC right? Thank you for your answer!

Is there anyway to invest in the yellow part? And if I invest regularly on say, Coinbase, do I automatically invest into the various forks as they get created or do I have to do anything manually. 
Also, I assume ROI means Return on Investment? If so, yea, that's all I'm really looking for, at least for now.

ELI5 for someone who just got into bitcoin and doesn't know any of the technical lingo yet?
Do I need to avoid this? How do I avoid this?

If I buy off of Coinbase or similar websites, do I automatically get both? Do i have to do anything special for it to work? What should I be looking for here.

Okay right on, thank you very much for your help! One last question, since you seem to know how this works; what causes these forks and why do they happen? Also what's the difference between a soft fork and a hard fork? 
Sorry for all the questions!
