There are multiple identical posters around Tokyo. 
I noticed there is one on top of a building around Ginza while driving on Chuo Kanjo-sen (Central Circular Route). 
Shibuya crossing showed this one several times also.
Then noticed it's on a side of a building, huge sized one, while riding the JR Yamanote line near Akihabara.
Recently paid for some stuff at BIC Camera Akihabara in bitcoin, and the staff told me it's less than one bitcoin payment per week.

Not many places in Japan also. 
BIC Camera stores accepting bitcoin, and the experience is always smooth, 0 confirmation supported by BitFlyer. Simply scan the QR code and it's done in a few seconds.
Several stores that use CoinCheck are having issues, and they stopped accepting bitcoin recently. Which is a bit frustrating.
