You'll start to understand the lingo eventually if you do research and stick around the space. I would recommend you look into other cryptos as well though because you'll hear mostly positives and hype about bitcoin around here. There are a lot of bad sides to bitcoin that don't get talked about as often as they should in this sub. It's good to keep yourself grounded with other opinions and try to fight the emotions/hype and look at things logically.

Does anyone have any educated guesses as to how the hardfork is going to effect Bitcoin's value in the short term? I'm not massively concerned, but I was wondering if I should buy before or after the fork.

The part that had me concerned was the getting coins out of exchanges to your own control. 
sorry if this is a dumb question, but why does this matter? Are some exchanges going to be converting peoples coins to only segwit2x?

When will it be safe to purchase regular coins again? I'm a noob and have been hearing that we need to be careful about buying new coins until this upcoming hardfork is passed. 
Do we have an exact date for when this will be, or when it will be safe to buy more coins again?

Okay cool. I've already got a mobile wallet too. I'll read through the section above for the seed phase stuff.  I noticed my wallet has two addresses. Any specific reason it has more than one?

So I'm a total noob who purchased his first bitcoin ($50 worth). I'd like to slowly purchase more over time and eventually get a hardware wallet, but in the meantime is it super dangerous to keep my funds in a software wallet on my desktop? I use Malwarebytes and Windows Defender as pc security.
My second question is: how the heck do I get my coins out of Gemini Exchange and into my wallet. I've been trying to figure out how to do the transfer, but aren't fully sure (trying to get my coins out before the hardfork I've been reading about). 
Sorry if these are dumb questions. Bitcoin seems to have a fairly steep learning curve so far.

It was one that was just called bitcoin. I switched to Electrum and it seems a lot better. There's only one address listed in it lol
