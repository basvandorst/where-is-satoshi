What does one need to open a node?

I will definitely look at those thank you! I'm taking my dog out to the park now but for sure tonight, any and all learning resources are welcome here.

Feel free to correct as I'm no expert but I'm under the impression that all one needs to open a node is: 
Capital to front for the node
Processing power to run it
Connections by which to facilitate the need for your node.
So if a Bank with all its money opened a node and had many connections to it, wouldn't a few large nodes gobble up the need for smaller ones?

Although the lightning network thing does have a lot of possibility to lead us back to the banks and centralization.

I think what I'm looking at is the Lightning Network itself, does no one else see the potential for big banks to open nodes and essentially make your p2p node useless? If there were several large hubs owned by big banks, they could essentially own the bitcoin tx fees no?

Stop being a pretentious dick, some of us have other things to be intelligent with, some of us have other valuable skills beyond "I read about bitcoin tech with all my spare time" it really is good to know the tech of what you're working with, and the cyber prefix is established, known, used. Its clueless behavior to get fucking rekt on the internet when you talk to a guy with the word cyber in his fucking job title.

Well the whole FDIC insurance thing comes into play here.
