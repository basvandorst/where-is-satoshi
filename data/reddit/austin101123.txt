@_date: 2018-01-31 20:38:47
Number of changes means nothing, just how well it can performs. Thousands of commits and new releases doesn't matter if they aren't doing anything important. It still can't process transactions like other ones can.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:50:38
I'm don't know what you are thinking about or referring too. You are being vague and not explaining.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:53:30
It's doing less transactions that take longer and cost more than Ethereum. It needs improvements and not simply to exist. Most don't use segwit and it isn't even reducing costs that much. Bitcoin can't just keep riding the high of being the first it needs to be better.

Wouldn't that be treated as a cash advance and have higher fees? I know most/all cards charge more for that kind of stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:35:44
What do you think deflation is? If you don't specify then it's in reference to cost of goods and services being deflated. I specified the currency was deflated, which yes does mean it's devalued and probably means there is inflation.

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:42:15
Currency inflation is, also called deflation which bitcoin is a deflationary currency. Just saying inflation usually means the cost of *goods/services* going up aka value of currency going down/deflating. You are correct it's just important to clarify this because it can be confusing
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:30:12
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:59:18
Why not make bigger blocks for right now and also do segwit and ln? I don't see why it can only be one or the other.

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:46:06
Deflation and inflation without context is in reference to the cost of goods, that the price of goods inflates or deflates. I'm saying this has happened with the currency. Saying a currency has deflated meaning the cost has gone up doesn't make sense. Deflation means it's gone down, not up.

Currency deflating helps prevent the rich from getting richer and promotes economic growth. If you know the value will only get higher as more people and production happens because there is a limited supply then you have incentive to not spend your money. This leads to less liquidity, too.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:05
Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:59:33
The value of the currency has deflated. The cost of goods and services has inflated. Costs have inflated therefore the currency deflated. I said the currency deflated which is true, which means inflation.

I put in *that* money, but wasn't allowed to put the money saved up through years of christmas and birthday money (that was invested in stocks under my dad's control) into it. That was roughly 3500 at &lt;$100 in 2013, whereas I didn't have money from working and put (way less than 3500) in 2014/5. In 2014/5 I had my own bank account and job (he did permiss that, I wasn't 18) and didn't need my dad's permission to use money in it.
Basically, the smaller amount of money I had free(ish) control over, years later, I did (oh, also an insignificant amount of money in 2013) invest. The larger amount of my money years earlier I didn't have control over and my dad didn't allow it despite the pleading of my case.

I refer to it as Bitcoin Core so people don't confuse it with Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:20:06
But would you create a new dollar to oppose the dollar and call it Australian Dollars? Maybe refer to those original dollars as something distinguishing too, like United States dollar. That way people more familiar with the Australian one don't get confused with the American one when they just see "dollar".
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:48:03
Most currencies don't use dollar in their name. There is Bitcoin diamond, gold, fast, and many others that use bitcoin. *Most* forks within Bitcoin still use Bitcoin. There are many types of bitcoins. There are, too, many different types of coins and coin is also similar to dollar. That doesn't exclude bitcoin from being common either. Bitcoin cash is a fork from BTC so, I mean I don't see why it wouldn't have Bitcoin in it's name, let alone saying it *shouldn't*.
Had segwit2x gone through, I imagine it would have used Bitcoin in its name even.

So it sounds like me like Bitcoin is very unsafe compared to regular money. All these people losing money and can't get it back and they don't get the person who took it? With PayPal or your bank that is *never* how it works. Why have I heard people try and say that bitcoin is safer then?
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:17:43


But that helps protect consumers, and he will get his money. If I buy something with bitcoin, and it turns out it's fake, then how can I get my money back? I can make a claim with paypal or my bank though and get it fixed.
And with the Target/Staples/HomeDepot thing, it was because of a hack. Isn't that how all the bitcoins get stolen? Except with bitcoins, you can't get them back.
No, I have never had that happen. I have sold 100s of guitars on ebay and it hasn't happened. It seems like everyone and their mother it getting their bitcoins hacked though.
If you don't give your name and etc., then how are we supposed to know when people do illegal actions? Why do you think things like TheSilkRoad can exist?
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:07:35

I wanted to buy at under $100 with a couple Grand but my dad didn't let me (he was in charge of my investments as I was a kid) and once it was 1/3 of what it once was due to poor management I got to invest at $400. Yay. Would have $60k instead of $5k. Possibly more, because with side money of mine I sold at (bought at $300 instead of $100, coinbase verification took too long as a minor) $600 and bought back at $300 AND I invested a third of the previously-managed-by-my-dad-money into ethereum at $10. Realistic case scenario it would be in total 6x money, no 1/3x money, (2800/400)x 2/3 of the money and (220/10)x 1/3 of the money would give me 10080USD equivalent of Bitcoin and 158400USD equivalent of ETH. 250k sounds a lot fucking nicer than 15k.

How is money redirected away from miners? You *still* haven't said how it does that. Just because more money goes to nodes doesn't mean any less is going to miners.

@_date: 2016-12-14 07:20:57
I thought mining verified the transactions. If more people are using it doesn't the price go up making mining more profitable which would cover the extra mining needed for more transactions?
But of course I don't know how the whole thing works I haven't read through all the source code nor would I even understand it all.

Are you sure? I get neither from my job. Are those a state-by-state thing? I only have to break by law if I work over 5 hours, and that goes away once I turn 18.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:55:24
So they are employees then, I thought so. Contractor sounds fucking retarded in regards to this. It's not like they got hired to do a job and then stop once they finish. It's not like they are working for another company that contracts them to drive. It's not like any of these people are independent contractors either.

So bitcoin can never get updated? So it'll be outdated sooner or later, probably sooner? Sounds like it's already run into that issue if it doesn't have the capabilities of going mainstream.
I don't see why noders getting money fucks over miners. I don't see how it's going to be very centralized either when it's people all over earth doing it.

Ethereum for example I would've bought at $1.
Yeah I may lose 30% overnight but stocks average 7% increase every year whereas a savings account gets you less than 2%.
Long term savings makes money if you... don't factor in opportunity cost.
If I lose 30% overnight I'm still quite up overall, I'll keep taking more riskier options while I'm young and don't have much money invested.
If I'm 45 and retired? I have no reason to risk everything so much. I'm 18 and can make $2500 in a summer right now, though.

That person can go on to reproduce and their children can die unless if the systemic issues are solved. Also the person that didn't get malaria may now die of HIV or malnourishment in Africa instead. If Africa becomes developed they will get healthcare and better quality of living and more sanitation etc., which seems like the best way to me. Todo that though you need a stable government and currency even if done philanthropically, so probably just use USD if you can but I don't think there is a stable enough government and society anywhere, you'd have to create one first or make do with something like Egypt and expand from there.

Dude, the point is both BTC and BCH want to be/think they are the better Bitcoin. Just because you think BTC is better doesn't mean they won't think BCH is better.
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:40:40
Could I save in a bitcoin bank somewhere where it's multiplied? \
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:02:37
Well I've heard a lot of BCH staying more true to Bitcoin, as increasing block size was an original plan. So of course they would associate with the name Bitcoin, that's what they are trying to be. Why would BTC associate with Bitcoin at all if it doesn't increase block size?
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:47:08
I mean, BTC claims itself as the true Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:45:13
Rename the fork? There are 2 coins that come out of a fork.

If I was an Australian and the Americans told me I couldn't call it a dollar because they wanted the name only for themselves, I'd tell them to fuck off.
It's not the "real" Bitcoin, there are multiple Bitcoins. USD isn't the "real" dollar either. It has a full name Bitcoin Cash and moniker BCH which differentiates it from BTC / Bitcoin Core.

My bank doesn't have the issue I was able to do it with paypal. I tried doing instant buy, but it doesn't allow me to select 1998 as birth year (paypal did...) so I can't do it for that.
Coinbase sucks :/
They also don't accept debit cards. Jesus Christ they got half a service
@_date: 2016-10-02 15:20:53
Why would I put money in my 401k if I have to pay extra to use it before I'm almost 60?
And long term savings loses money but investing makes money.
Lets say i was 18 5 years ago and took your advice I'd have quite less than 200k.
Hell I wanted to buy ethereum at $1 but still wasn't 18. Could've gone from $2500 to $25,000. (poorly managed stocks by my dad)
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:58:56
The only issue is that they don't let me enter in my actual birth date, that's the only issue here really! If it wasn't for that I could buy and sell bitcoins right away.
I have limits with how much I can use with paypal too, the same $500/day limit as coinbase. They just allowed me to verify my account by actually letting me put in the correct age.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:40:37
How many more Africans will die later because of the ones you saved now? Stopgap measures aren't helping the fucked uo Africa. Investment and running businesses at a loss would be more worthwhile.

So what exactly is the block size, why does it need to be increased, what will happen if it doesn't?
Is the 1MB the size of all bitcoin addresses and balances?
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:48:07
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:43:12
0.10.0 client working with BTC can be an argument than BTC is a bitcoin, but doesn't really do anything for BCH not being bitcoin. So it seemed like you were implicitly saying BTC is better, so it should be *the* bitcoin.
Also, uh, what was it BCH did that went against the original plan? I thought the only change was 8MB block sizes.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:14:01
Isn't every transaction verified? I thought you could see every one. How does one happen then?
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:26:30
BTC is definitely *not* the original. The current iteration of BTC has been through many revisions and even hardforks where it was the one changing in the fork.
USD, AUD, CAD, are all called dollars. Why should they change their name away from Bitcoin and not BTC? Just because you think BTC is better than BCH doesn't mean it can be the only one called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:15:48
I am using the same bank and account as I did with paypal, and paypal does not have the same limitations. I could transfer money instantly - and I did, with paypal.
I'm having to wait a week to get my bitcoins right now... Hopefully I can sell in time to get big money instead of just money.
Also damn, yeah, I found out it doesn't matter what the price is a week from now if I try to buy now. I wouldn't bought last night at $350 had I known that, just bought it at $405 a bit ago.
@_date: 2017-05-03 03:07:40

If 21M BTC covered all of that currently, it would be just over 3M per coin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:20:27
It's gonna keep going up, and then it's gonna do down. And then it might be lower than originally (lets say ~$250-300), but then it will go back up and above that gradually until this happens again.
Or some weird shit might happen with China and stuff and it might not repeat, or might go slightly different. Can't predict the distant future, just the nearby.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:42:19
Why don't people but it at the one place for $1400 and sell it at another for $1600? Makes no sense

I remember years ago when it was around $100, I wanted to put my ~$3500 (saved up from Christmas and Birthdays every year and managed in the stock market by my Dad) into Bitcoin. He uh, didn't let that occur. Instead, it went to about $1200 in some other shit. I would have about $73,500-$125,00 now. :/

Adding on that it's so half-assed there appears to be no person who I can call, no live chat. God damnit. Fuck bitcoin has shitty services if this pile of crap is 
Edit: They do have live chat... Didn't appear on my screen until being there for a while though. And no normal access found from google, gethuman, etc. It's a popup in the bottom right.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:18:31
What the fuck? You can't even use bitcoin without the internet? What's the point of it then? It would be easier to just hand someone cash.

"Bitcoin Core initial synchronization will take time and download a lot of data. You should make sure that you have enough bandwidth and storage for the full block chain size (over 20GB)."
What the fuck? To use it you have to download something over 20GB in size?

My bad. That's for when you go to try and download the Bitcoin app.

What do you mean by it doesn't scale?
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:41:31
Why? The only bad thing he said is there are security concerns, but didn't say why at all there would be security concerns. Well, I see a slippery slope argument of when it's trying to do 10k transactions a second but we are only talking about doubling block size. We have the hardware to easily do that, and 10k can and should happen in the future when  that 87TB a year becomes the 80GB hard drive a year.




We don't have that now. When we get it, great. But it's not like we can't increase the block size in the interim.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:54:32
Convenience, UI
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:49:04
Maybe we should start saying pure bitcoin instead of pure gold.

@_date: 2015-02-23 14:25:49
What's TA?
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:22:23
You would have to do at least twice as many transactions to cause the same price increase.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:57:07
Within 3 years? Bitcoin will be way behind at that point.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:44:31
That is not how transaction fees for bitcoin nor coinbase work.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:56:04
Wait. So what exactly is a *block*? What does a *block* do?
I know that mining is finding blocks, and that mining also verifies transactions on the network.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:17:57
I don't think I get what you are saying. I don't see how security is significantly negatively impacted.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:30:33
Because they only stand to lose money by not having these transactions. They make money every single time you make a transaction, whether it's a buy or a sell no matter what happens to the price afterwards.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:24:23


ETH has been around for about 2yrs, not the 6 or whatever litecoin has. Adoption is just now starting.

I'm laughing
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:56:21
It also provides better transaction times and costs even with same amount of transactions.

Oh Ok cool. Did satoshi invent bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:29:28
They make money whenever you buy or sell on their site though.

Doesn't that work for the US too?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:32:18
What about 's exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:53:56
Why would they have any bitcoin on hand and not just buy it when you buy it?
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:28:19
wait wtf. just yesterday it was 210 and i was going to buy some tomorrow. It's already at 250?!
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:01:39
How would that break bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:21:39
It has grown 1700% in the last 2 years?! I thought the point of bitcoin was to avoid inflation?
Edit: Wait a second. I failed my math. It DEFLATED 1700%.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:03:40

Ethereum has half the market cap of bitcoin and almost as many daily trades (without taking forever to do so, either), how are they not in the running? You're delusional.
Litecoin is less than 1/10th the size of bitcoin!

I'm not sure who is telling the truth. Internet Cryptocurrency Obsession seems like a joke, but Initial Coin Offering doesn't make sense either as you just mine it or sell it... I guess you could call the first person selling it the ICO but that's pretty odd.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:35:09
When you buy the coin they buy the coin, they aren't hodling coins and doling them out at only high prices.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:07:39
I don't see how that's I significant though. I haven't seen anyone say how these high fees are needed because there was weak security before, nor there being any security issues due to low fees in the past. Just because there is a mathematical theoretical difference in security doesn't mean there is any practical significant difference.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:13:08

@_date: 2013-11-17 23:41:16


You failed with your reasoning there.
It would be the same thing as saying 1 unit of bitcoin, 2 unit**s** of bitcoin. In that sense you wouldn't add the S anyways. I am saying we should say "I just bought 5 bitcoin" rather than "I just bought 5 bitcoin**s**". And this is somewhat already happening, with "I should buy *some* bitcoin" vs "I should buy *some* bitcoin**s**.
When we aren't saying a specific amount, most people already keep it as bitcoin, but even when a specific amount I say it should be bitcoin, without the s.

(Also, not extremely new, I actually first heard about Bitcoins in 2011 but my dad didn't let me buy any until they were already at $300, so I didn't really look at much until then.)

Stocks are not the only thing possible to invest in.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:28:54
Wait what?
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:29:07
What does he do?
@_date: 2013-09-19 06:22:28
What am I missing here?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:54:52
People are downvoting you so I am guessing your reasoning is wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:10:52
Oh. Yeah I saw the price was higher on there so I was thinking of selling there. But if all you can do is buy and get goxbux.... Yeah I would stay away.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:25:42
How is it not an exchange? You buy and sell bitcoins with others.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:39:15
Wait. I can buy it for $700 at coinbase, and then sell it at $1,100 at BTCChina. How do I go about doing it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:03:48
Welcome to language, where the words are made up and the rules don't matter.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:47:59
(No, I don't remember because this is the first time I've head of it ;) )
So are there no faucets that give out... Satoshi's or anything? haha
Was basically the faucet giving it out because he wanted it to gain interest?
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:01:24
oh damn its the same as Japanese. teacher said we got a lot from chinese, I didn't know it was exactly the same.
So after I learn Japanese I might as well learn Chinese then Korean.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:33:18
Hold up so there are places that *give out* bitcoins called faucets? Where do I sign up!
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:28:55
Welp with my ~10.5k karma I got .36USD
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:09:31
Where can I buy and sell as an exchange than? To where it is as easy as a stock exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:57:02
wow so rich doge spreading to cheap doge
much love
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:56:25
How come when I bought something from coinbase it took almost a week?
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:40:21
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:23:36
I am 15 here, heard wanted to buy it at 13 but my dad just now let me buy it.
/tangent: I really started hammering on him letting me buy some about 2 months ago he finally gave in yesterday and he also bought some of his own.
I could have a much larger net worth right now if he let me buy back before the hump in 2011. :( /tangent
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:02:22
Yes. 4 is bad luck.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:12:58
Holy crap that used to actually be for that.
@_date: 2013-09-13 10:24:12
What exactly happened with BFL and who are they?
@_date: 2013-11-03 14:42:48
I know I just wanted to buy a whole one instead of a partial one. I guess buying small parts of a bitcoin until I got a whole one would've been better.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:11:38
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:30:37
What video is this from? I remember watching the presentation on climate change, but I don't remember where!
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:05:37
Don't forget greek.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:37:03
My estimate is $1000-1500, and that it will then drop down to $300-800.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:35:14
What does 2 PH/s and 3 PH/s mean, and what does that mean for us?
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:07:04
What about mtgox.com?
@_date: 2013-09-16 03:47:32
Does this mean there is no consumer protection with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:35:23
What is LTC?
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:50:36
I am trying to buy it now, but where can I buy it? I've heard that mtgox is terrible and coinbase isn't allowing it right now.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:58:36
Is there a popular one like Paypal, for USD?
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:12:00
Is it seriously over 200 now?! A month ago I decided I was going to buy some for $140. Now I don't have enough for one, but I have $140. :(
Guess I can't just buy a whole one then. :/
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:17:38
Yes! BTC is currently trading for almost $500, this is a steal.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:08:12
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:42:09
And now double backpedaling. Yes. Ok... Whatever
@_date: 2013-09-14 16:39:46
What exactly has been happening?
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:15:40
Exactly. It's only countable if we give it measures. You can count gold in oz, kg, lb, etc. You can count bitcoin in BTC, satoshi, mBTC, all artificial ways we count.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:52:12
Like satoshi/kilokarma?
@_date: 2013-09-11 01:55:01
I guess I will do this. Sorry haven't thought of that haha.
