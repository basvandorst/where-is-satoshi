Great news! I've been pitching it on our side of the river as well. There's a new sushi place on the north east edges of Windsor called "sushi bar". Although it is on coinmap last I spoke with the owner she was planning on incorporating bitcoin but hasn't actually followed through yet. I offered my help and she said she would contact me but I havn't heard from her.

He's not a hero. He's just some guy who 1. Hasn't had the chance to defend himself and 2. Selling bitcoins to people who buy drugs is not a reason to question their honesty.
If it is than everyone on local bitcoins and every bank teller, atm, and currency exchange is suspect.

There are only 3 ways governments get money. 
1. Tax
2. Inflation
3. Debt
Either way it's off of our backs. We are the collateral. Bail out money isn't magic.

Have you ever been consulted? I know I havn't. What happens when government doesn't do what you wants, or does the opposite of what it said it would? What happens when you don't do what the government says?
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:07:53


You havn't chatted with many anarchists have you :)
Yes. That is why I am a anarchist. A government cannot serve its stated primary purpose of property protection without expropriating property. Governments are inherently violent, thus they are impermissible.


Representing "common interest" is just the majority abusing the minority. 
Yes. Corporations and politicians are often working together, that's why it doesn't make sense to want to give them more power.

Glad to see Second Market strikes fear in someone's heart besides mine. I comfort in the thought that they can have their super central regulated wall street exchange, meanwhile by the time that is in full swing decentralized exchanges will likely be hitting the scene.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:18:01
I see a demand for this don't you?
Do people want audited exchanges? yep.
Is it reasonable to expect this to appear on the market? Yep.
Is it already happening? Yep. 
Coinkite and Neo&amp;Bee are making serious efforts for transparent accounting. Gox just lit a fire under everyones ass.

External auditing, transparent accounting, and blockchain proof are ALREADY emerging. We don't need some idiot politician to impose his own ignorant schemes in ONE jurisdiction. Those begging for regulation will be sorry.

Anyone been to the new places that popped up on coinmap? A sushi place and pizza place in troy, and two places out by Dearborn?
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:09:05
Not quite, but there is a curve. If the government simply outsources something it is only private in name, an certainly doesn't have any resemblance if a free market. The only thing that's changed is titles and profits are more of a priority. "Private" prisons are a good example.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:15:07

Do not throw away ANYTHING. 
passwords, keys, and forms of decryption are likely written on paper, stored in thumb drives or other equipment. Paper, electronic equipment, etc should all be preserved.  Like one user said, if your patient the coins will be there forever If passwords and keys are lost, thrown away, our destroyed you will never be able to access his bitcoins. Be careful! Be patient! Take your time and learn about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:02:30
I must not have gotten the memo. Still though, I can't believe I'm seeing articles like this. And finally someone explaining that bitcoin is not untraceable.

Many people don't know the difference between positive actions (regulation) and negative ones (protection against theft and fraud/recourse etc) 
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:12:09
Actually the amount of bitcoin in a user's account is adjusted with company reserves.
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:31:26
I've been doing it all over this thread.
Regulation =/= punishment/recourse

How many confirmations do I need to know that "the sale is final" so to speak?
And are confirmations unusually slow right now? (like 3-5 minutes for the first confirmation). I bought a sandwich via my blockchain wallet over an hour ago and the transaction is still greyed out with only 8 confirmations. I included a miners fee.
Also. Why is my Mycelium wallet permanently saying I am receiving 0.00001mbtc with 0 confirmations?
Thank you very much!
 
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:54:32
I do not disagree. But regardless of how the state recognizes them done decrees are different than others. Regardless what you want to call them
Another example:
Stealing is illegal. (Negative law. Libertarians approve)
Though shalt not sell alcohol after 2am. (Positive law/regulation. Libertarians disapprove)
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:06:01
As I understand it they are using bitcoins, but internal to Bee, not on the blockchain. The merchants will have Bee POS terminals.
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:33:10
Keeping it short and sweet:
**1.because people still want and need things**. In your example, your care needs to be fixed. 
**2.** It doesn't matter whether you spend $100 or $100 of btc. Either way thats $100 worth that you are spending on fixing a car. *Its either $100 worth of btc spent, or its $100 that you spent on fixing your car and not on btc.* **3.**People would rather have things sooner than later because our time is very scarce.** This is *exactly* why the electronics industry doesn't collapse because prices are always rapidly falling. In general, the fact that the prices of tv's and computers are rapidly falling does not stop people from buying tv's and computers.

fate of gox = fate of bitcoin?

The fate of the entire btc ecosystem does not rest on one shitty exchange. One that many were expecting to be insolvent for sometime. This isn't exactly groundbreaking. This only confirms peoples suspicions.

I like that they are anonymous, but the more pressure on them to prove their trustworthiness the better.

Cryptokite and neo&amp;bee are using external auditing and blockchain proof. 
This is what the market is demanding, this will become the norm.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:55:34
Says who?
Says anyone who doesn't like people who violence outside of defense and applies this standard to everything.


well if that happened then we would have a government again. So I guess that's the worst case scenario. But in a society where law is only actions that harm other people and arbitration and rights protection is available competitively and with blockchain type technology I expect that outcome to be unlikely.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:23:15

Ignore some regulations and tell me how that goes
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:06:13
I didn't say they didn't.
I'm explaining why libertarians in general approve of the former and disapprove the latter.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:44:05
How has that been going for us?
2008 financial crisis, bailins, bailouts, iceland/greece/cyprus, quantitative easing, madoff, etc.. 
Gox is childs play compared to what our wise and fair regulators and banks have been doing.
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:26:57


There is a moral side and a practical side. Ill keep it brief.
Moral: regulations are positive actions. They punish actions that do not by themselves harm anyone and do not allow people to choose what risk they are comfortable with
Practical: they are arbitrary, misinformed, and Google the terms "rent seeking" and regulatory capture"


It probably would too a limited extent. But ultimately bitcoin will have its legitimacy without regulation although it will take longer. I prefer that the space be given time to mature natural/voluntary "regulation" before it is tainted by politics
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:43:41
I'm sorry but so long as I am a decent human being I will not advocate to bring prisons and guns to bear on someone to force my preference on them. I may like auditing and stuff but never will I demand that person's be thrown in prison, have their assets or rights seized because they didn't obey the opinions of powers that be. Let's do this the right way. Let's at least be peaceful and civilized about it.
Neither can we trust them. They do not understand bitcoin and their motives are neither pure or benign. Honesty, consistency, or expertise is nowhere to be seen in today's political and regulatory environment.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:59:43
It all depends on how much sway bitcoin companies have with politicians.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:21:37
Seriously? Wishing someone who have hurt anybody to rot in prison? Have you ever been to prison? Don't you dare wish that on someone who at worst has broken some arbitrary laws ESPECIALLY before they have been proven guilty. Your a Fucking horrible person.

Google "2008 financial crisis", "quantitative easing", and "bail ins" for starters.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:36:37
Because that is not is not the right way to do it. Regulation is not optional. It is orders backed up by prisons and guns. I may like audits and stuff but I will never as long as I am a decent human being advocate for anyone to be thrown in prison or have their assets or rights seized because they didn't obey the powers that be.  
If auditing and all that is such a great thing we won't need to force it on anyone. 
We also can't trust them. They do not understand bitcoin and their motivations are neither benign or pure. Honesty, consistency, fairness, and integrity are not qualities I see in today's political and regulatory environment.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:46:02
Hardly. He is accused of the OPPOSITE of money laundering (as if being private with money is evil)(as if drugs are evil). He sold bitcoin to people who sold bitcoin who bought drugs on the silk road. Since when should anybody be responsible for how people spend money that you give them. Money laundering is attempting to dirty money clean. This was a case of clean money made dirty. 
The charges are not going to stick.
