The channel bot just berated me for mentioning an altcoin... Did this message get through? This really is pretty gosh darn relevant to bitcoin proper...

How to avoid this situation in future? I kept my funds on btc-e because it seemed large enough &amp; it felt safer than having them on my phone or on some random usb stick... What is the best way to hold crypto?

What is? So eventually all bitcoin will vanish into nothingness because given enough time, everyone will make enough mistakes? That makes no sense.

I still don't see how the current price, market cap &amp; value of bitcoin meets any definition of a "bubble". Please explain what you imagine is happening &amp; why?

The hysteria around transfer fees is not something I really understand. You can CHOOSE how fast you want the transaction to occur. Faster is more expensive, obviously. I transferred some the other day, in the middle of the BCH vs BTC shit storm, at the cheapest setting, and it cost me about 5 bucks to send around $600 US, and it was completed in about 15 minutes. Hardly a huge deal. 
Maybe all the people complaining about fees just need a better wallet?

I'm still waiting for some decent posts about gold to permeate the crypto channels... We marvel at the hashrates and all that computing power to maintain blockchains, ponder all that energy... But seldom do we reflect on the physics of gold &amp; wonder why it became valuable in the first place. Gold lasts. It doesn't corrode. The debts paid with gold 5000 years ago - that gold is still here. It takes the energy of two colliding neutron stars to create gold. That's more energy than... well, quite a few blockchains. ��

Electrum is pretty good.

Well that seems like a bit of a flaw in the system? What if one makes a typo in the send address? Funds destroyed?? Seems weird.

I'm just hypothesising... ��

What on earth are you basing that assertion on? Contrast Bitcoin with the unlimited and continuous creation of fiat currencies worldwide... It's not unreasonable to suggest that one satoshi could one day correlate to 1 cent. Bitcoin's market cap is still miniscule.

Oh gosh. I hadn't even considered that scenario... What happened to your funds? Bounce back? Or gone forever?
