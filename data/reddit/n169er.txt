Literally the definition of sheeple. "Complaining about how taxes work, then you should not be allowed to use one of the few things that are actually putting tax money to good use". You expect anyone that is forcefully paying for something to not use it just because hes forced to pay for it? Are you dull? Also why not implement a decent tax system? All taxes are optional but you are only allowed to use the thing you pay for? You know kind of how every single other service works? Seems to work quite good right? If you wanna be socialistic about it why not pay with percentages instead of fixed prices? That could not be any better could it? Mind blown sheeple?

Think the avrage joe is just to lazy and stupid. Make a more insecure and easy way, they will get hacked, just like they get scammed on a daily basis. They don't want to learn how to protect themselves. Let them. But let them push global btc adoption before doing so. Its not hard to use today, they are just plain stupid. These are the people that write their "password123" on a postit and put under their mat when specifically told not to yet cant bother when being asked to actually do that with their seed phrase.
Some smartass should figure out how to make a seed from an email and a password, 2 keys combined making a bigger number to represent their keys. Could fool them its easy enough for them to get on it.
Look at Zimbabwe or whatever countries in hyperinflation. If their 250year old grandmothers whom never seen a computer can figure out bitcoin. They can to. They just dont want to.

Quantum bruteforcing probably is an issue, but id be far more afraid of nuclear codes, bombs falling from the skies and all other scenarios using modern tech before that happens. The letter soups owning those machines have bigger fish to fry. Wont have the time to touch bitcoin before their secret is out in the open and fixes flying all around.
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:46:21
Problem is your not even arguing. You have a superficial understanding of two things and think its an argument to explain this superficial understandings combined with copy pasting things you dont understand at all. Good luck with your shitcoins and inflations

Imagine the deflation if an entire country get BTC in universal income while hodling. The us would be bankrupt in a year and a single BTC would be trillions. As a non-us citizen, please do this.

I know its fun scamming the scammers and all that, but playing a bit of the devils advocate, your one of them now. Could be another Nigerian prince, but could also have been your non-techy grandma whom herself got lured in to a scheme and you just helped those scammers double team her.
And since she just blatantly trusted you i find it hard to think shes a hardcore scammer with only stealing bitcoin on her mind, she would never have sent you any if that was the case.
Scamming is bad, but its best to just ignore them. Scamming someone still makes you a scammer no matter what interest you think they have.

It doesnt take nearly as much computing power to hash as in brute forcing a hash. We break 20 year olds encryption by being smart, encryptions being stupid and because we have time on our side. Look at md5 for example. Takes forever to bruteforce, is proved non reversable, but through the years we have accumulated quite hefty rainbow tables which means even though its "unhackable" you can crack it on a website in 2 seconds.
The main issue with computing power and hashing algorithms is to make an algorithm which takes half a second, not so long you get tired of waiting but long enough so you cant brute force every single posibility in an hour. However upgrading your gear or having 20 years in on your back yields the same results.
But quantum computers wont give you the posibility to create better algorithms, it will only allow the world to use the more calculating hashing functions without your local adhd kid spasming out because it takes to long to load. It doesnt really affect the reversibility of a function.

Kinda is though. There is a reason bitcoin is worth 11k and you'd have to pay people to use your shitcoin.
Also hodl is an expression. Spend and replace is the action. Most people use bitcoin when they get the chance, they just replace the amount after. Nobody is in bitcoin for emotional value. They will exchange those coins sooner or later. Its not some virtual centerpiece people spend their money on. You should probably read a bit more, you seem to have quite little understanding of the stuff.

Bro you are talking about sniffing data on a game to which you don't have password protected servers. And no, swapping out texture packs, making your own textures is not easier then pressing a mouse button.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:15:13
Read the comment again. Nobody is hodling to build a virtual centerpiece. You should really do some more lurking.
Lets try this some other way. Why is fiat, jewellery, cars and houses not a ponzi?
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:53:07
And i shouldn't have to explain to you why bitcoin isnt in but here we are. Its fine that you cant explain. You painted yourself in a corner. Like i said. Lurk more.

No, the growth still exist due to fractions of coins. The only difference is that there is a bigger group that earns on the growth. Instead of a handfull of bankers getting more money buy inflating your currency under your nose, every bitcoin get more value from the growth. So everyone gains as much per capita, but still a lot of rich gets richer. Better than before though.

What is this based off? Is there some site that shows market cap based on stuff like node amount, daily transaction amounts, total computing power and stuff like that? I get its not totally fair to compare some of those things with some specific coins but if a page had multiple comparisons youd get a wider picture.
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:10:28
Thats probably a reason nt to get it. When bitcoin goes to the moon who do you think a robber would target first? The one with a bitcoin tattoo aged from before it hit moon or some random? This is basically the equivalent of tattooing world of warcraft on yourself except it displays that you own something criminals love to take from others. Enjoy hitting the moon.
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:05:36
Go small bits every week/month and stack up some to go all in if it reaches 7k. You'd still have some coins if it never dips and you get extra if it does.
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:58:39
Localbitcoin or bitcoin.se kyc though and high fees
@_date: 2019-08-08 10:19:46
When brandishing your body for the rest of your life you should probably ask yourself why before why not.
Also you realise when bitcoin goes to the moon together with the aging of that tattoo your gonna get a bunch of unwanted attention right?

Local as in localhost not lan. You can only sniff network packages if there is a package
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:03:25
Yea no. Your talking about stuff you obviously dont know anything about. You prove that over and over.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:37:15
Not really, lurk more.
Also that was not really an answear. Im asking you why you think those are not ponzies yet so certain bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:21:23
Always the same plan. "I will invest in bitcoin. After that worked i will cash out and invest in something that didn't work in the first place hence bitcoin was step one". Wut?
If you invest 100k in bitcoin, grow that to 1m. Why on earth would you cash out and gamble with some other shady investment. Just do nothing, repeat step 1, let that 1m grow to 10m in the same time you just did the first time.
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:27:48
Yea those guys own the banks and profit shit tonnes from it. Of course they are not going to like bitcoins, to them thats like giving away trillions.
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:54:47
"Modify the lava" you could just block the flow... you over complicate the simplest things and under complicate the harder parts. Minecraft chunks are not loaded in custom 100x100x1 chunks. The decoding would be way more of a puzzle than you think.your script to do that would be more advanced than the network sniffing it self.
And if the server was a network server, which would be the only way for you to sniff the content. Then you could just enter the server and bucket up the lava. Your attack vectors are completely screwed.
Im not saying its a good way to store the seed, im just saying you wouldnt be the one that hacked it.
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:08:32
I think you should see this more are a feature. Sooner or later it will be possible to brute force wallets. But when it is there will allready be an update letting you use more secure hashing functions. It wong happen over night, you will have time to prepare. You will be noticed through your daily news about all the nuclear codes being at risk and what not. Whats left behind are all thf lost and unused wallets. Through more time they will all be hacked/mined, and the coins will be back in circulation. So we will be one step closer to completely 21 mil. Its a fair trade. Paying people to keep the blockchain secure.
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:04:32
If it were the first block would have been mined 10 minutes after. It wasnt, it took a week for before the blocks started to get mined. Satoshi picked this article for a reason.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:19:34
Yea but that was way back in the days. Not to certain how it would handle it today as its way more decentralised and such.

I think your not understanding what you're saying. What is the difference between fiats? The face on the bills? What is the difference between cars? The motor and paint? What is the difference between houses? The amounts of rooms? All this can be replicated. But you cant force a coin into the blockchain. That means its harder to replicate bitcoins than almost everything else in the world.
If there is no difference between bitcoin and a fork, why dont you make a fork and sell those? Should make you a fortune. Except there is, they are called shitcoins for a reason. One of bitcoins most valuable assets is the people using them, supporting it etc. The whole idea behind money. Try get that with your shitcoins.
Bitcoin has utility, you just dont understand that value is a utility. Just like those paper bills in your wallet. They are way more usable than all other pieces of paper because its utility is value. You seem to confuse utility with physical action. And etherum has that if thats more interesting for you.
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:48:10
Yea no. Id love to see someone rebuild the key through wireshark... Yea theoretically possible, but practically nah. Also you dont just need wireshark, you need to mim his connection with the server. If its local then you cant do anything with wireshark.

@_date: 2019-08-05 17:14:53
There is no underlying value to anything. The value is what someone puts in to it. And a bitcoin cannot be replicated. You can create a shitcoin if you want. But not a bitcoin. That is why people value it.

@_date: 2019-08-08 01:31:24
Do you have an example of when bitcoin rolled back the blockchain?
Don't really think its possible today. Would have to convince all the miners and nodes, wasnt there a huge debate when mtgox got hacked and people wouldn't back down? Kinda defeats a great purpose of bitcoin. And then there are does checkpoint blocks preventing a 51% attack.

@_date: 2019-08-08 10:22:57
Yea ethereum. Thats monopoly money.
But even if everyone agrees you can roll back past last checkpoint. You wiuld have to hardfork. And any shitcoin should prove how stuid that is. Would take an insane bugfix or insanely good improvement to get that going and taking over bitcoins top place. Besides it wouldn't be bitcoin any more

Etherum is a bit more centralised than bitcoin.
