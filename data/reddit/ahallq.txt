It will work on both, yes, but it's not a great idea for back up
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:57:27

@_date: 2016-04-14 22:58:08

@_date: 2016-04-14 23:16:42

@_date: 2016-04-14 23:13:57
Yes it is, that face proves that
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:34:42
I don't think so, so many valuable things could be abuse 
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:45:42

“I like Lightning, but there’s still a lot of unanswered questions. And you just can’t assume that Bitcoin’s future is going to rest on one specific technology that hasn’t been rolled out yet.”
