Thank your dad for hodling the bag for me at 19k while I got out of core

Implying that I’m a child because I disagree with his argument is not a productive way to begin discourse. Call it what you’d like

Maybe next time instead of ad hominem attacks, explain to me why this is a good comparison for an asset that is digital cash. Do you frequently use ounces of gold to purchase anything? Or is it simply used for speculation and jewelry? If core is just gold2.0 for tech nerds (like myself) to HODL then what utility does it provide? I’m not trying to attack, I’m trying to understand the your line of thinking. A store of value is great, but that’s not the only aspect of money that makes it valuable. There are plenty of things that are a great store of value, but we don’t consider them money.

Sir, a definition is certainly not an argument - especially when I call into question the idea that bitcoin=gold=money. While I may have mistakenly conflated “unit of account” and “medium of exchange” the basis behind good faith argument is to take your intellectual opponents thoughts and not not-pick semantic errors or differences. The context could have given you clues that I meant medium of exchange. And never in my responses did I refer to BCH. I think you’re reading into my posts as some sort of attack on you or the BTC community, but it’s not. I own BTC, I own plenty of other coins as well. Why do we (the crypto community) have to act like questioning usefulness of certain aspects of a coin is tantamount to treason? 
I see your view that a store of value is a good thing, but I disagree that it is a good thing for bitcoin. Which, by the way, due to mining is creating approximately 10% more a year. This would not be a good store of value in an environment where global GDP grows at half that.

Goddamnit guys, when was the last time you used gold for anything? Stop acting like this is a good analogy for something that should be a unit of exchange.

In financial markets this is called a cup and handle. It's a technical pattern that usually signals a continuation pattern. (Price will keep going up)
