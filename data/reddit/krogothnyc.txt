Bitbills are the very first incarnation of Bitcoin in a physical form. They were introduced in the beginning of 2011..so before Casascius made his coins.
    They are very rare as most were redeemed and the cards thrown away. Many collectors seek Bitbills and would die to have one in their collection. 
      Just finding a redeemed bitbills is extremely hard let alone a loaded one. And yes there are people that will pay very high premiums to acquire a loaded Bitbills!
      What is even rarer were the metal Bitbills called Bankcards. Less than 20 were ever sold and very very few are thought to still exist.
       These are part of Bitcoins history..someday they will be museum pieces.
