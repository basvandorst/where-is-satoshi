Go on to the site I recommended, they have a pretty thorough guide. And remember that even if ID is required, that's ok. Buying bitcoin is a totally legitimate, legal purchase and if necessary there are resources to wash your bc. Feel free to message me if you have a ?

It may not be the wallet where the problem was. When you sent it, or when they sent you the address, did they make sure the site they were accessing wasn't a fishing site? A friend of mine used grams helix light, typed it into the search bar clicked on the top search result that looked like the normal webpage, to get the address he did the same things as normal and sent it on its way. Gone. When you access sites on tor browsers, you have to remember that everyone on there has the same privacy luxury you do so there's nothing stopping them from buying a similar domain copying the sites contents and paying for an ad(like google ads) on tor search engine  for a day and disappearing before anyone can do anything

I've used it successfully many times. There will be a steep price for wire versus moneygram versus cash deposit but each user has a trust level based on number of transactions/successful. Also, the bitcoin is held in escrow as soon as you open the transaction and is released once they acknowledge they've received the money so they can't really keep your money.

I'm confused by why you want to use the same wallet on and off of a tor network. 
If anonymity is what you're looking for, buy your bitcoin and have it sent to an online wallet you access on the clearweb like localbitcoins.com 
From there, even if you send it to your electrum wallet, they can still be tracked so you need to use a washing resource like grams helix light and enter your electrum address as the receiving address. 
Also, electrum is an app so unless you're running tails you're not accessing it via tor. 
In any case I don't recommend between going back and forth from clearnet to darknet with the same account.
Let me know if you have any more questions
