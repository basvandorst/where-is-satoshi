Confirmed. I have no wallet in my email archive.

I do have an encrypted wallet copy in my email, google drive, and/or dropbox?!
That's strange because I don't have a google drive or dropbox account and I don't think I have a copy of my wallet in my email archive, but I will go double-check to be sure.
I lost access to my BTC through my online wallet, I thought I was pretty clear about that.

I would agree that "their reputation isn't abysmal," but there have been some significant issues over the years. It seems like they've worked through most of them fine enough, so I'll reserve "abysmal" and go with "intermittently problematic."
The problem I am experiencing is most likely caused by my email provider upon further troubleshooting, confirmation pending, will update when resolved.

Noted. This in an old account I use for quick purchases online. Again, Blockchain.info has been useful in the past, not so much now.

That's it. I cannot login to zendesk because it won't send a temp password to my email. I am not getting any support except for automated responses.
As I mentioned before in my post: "When I check my email, I have zero messages, even after checking spam folders." I am slightly perplexed why you'd ask me something that I have already provided an answer to.
I have not had a problem using Blockchain.info in the past and would like to continue using you guys in the future if I can at least access my funds.
Maybe this will illustrate my frustration: imagine you deposit funds at a bank. Imagine your ATM card doesn't work. Imagine you contact customer support and receive no resolution for over a week. How would you feel?

No I can't, but after talking with +I did discover that my email provider does block blockchain.info messages and therefore I wasn't getting any of the support replies. I am currently working on restoring access and I will update my post with the details for other users who are experiencing the same.

It is hard to disagree with you considering my recent experiences, but I have used them in the past without any major issues.

Thanks for the info! I have finally made contact with Mandrik so when I regain access to my account I will look to enable these features. I had set up this account a long while ago.
