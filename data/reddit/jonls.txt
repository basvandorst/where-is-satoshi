No, the slashes are not appropriate for a URI scheme without a hierarchical part (like bitcoin)

Well, the bitcoin-qt is MIT licensed so "transliterations" to other languages are very much allowed.

Yes, but I don't think BitPay is really the right place to put the blame for this. The person who held bitcoins but now decides to exchange their coins for goods through BitPay is the actual reason. The fact that some people want to no longer hold a part of their bitcoins is the real cause of the price drop and BitPay is only indirectly part of this by offering an easy way for people to exchange their bitcoins for goods. If all the people who are buying stuff also immediately bought back bitcoins from the market, there would be no effect on the price. People simply don't want to hold as many bitcoins as they used to.

Maybe post this in since it is mostly of interest to people in Denmark?

I'm wondering if I should switch from blockchain.info to Mycelium (or something else). Do you know if any of them can send to a new change address instead of sending back to existing addresses?

Another reddit user supposedly had a conversation with Mr. Bardin, and he asked for this question to be posted on Moderator. Source:

Currently, yes. The backend is separated in the code so it should not be too hard to add different payment processors, particularly if they provide a payment page and callback like Coinbase does. For static addresses or BIP32-based addresses the plugin has to provide a payment page itself which is a little more work.

I get the same result as the wiki. You are not interpreting the string as hexadecimal string.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '800C28FCA386C7A227600B2FE50B7CAE11EC86D3BF1FBE471BE89827E19D72AA1D'.decode('hex')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; hashlib.sha256(s).hexdigest()

At least one other tool is already using the format `&lt;link rel="bitcoin" href="bitcoin:1NS17iag9jJgTHD1VXjvLCEnZuQ3rJEDGL" /&gt;` for linking a page to a bitcoin address ( Maybe this would be a good idea to recognize as well?

Yes, it is very important to realize that something that might be a strong passphrase elsewhere is not necessarily a strong passphrase for a brain wallet. Even though "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" has a lot of characters it is very likely that someone else will type that phrase as a brain wallet and obtain the same private key.

I seem to remember another zero-output transaction that eventually got confirmed. Maybe some miner will accept it although it may take a long time. Maybe you can broadcast a proper transaction that will supersede the faulty one.
It can occur again if Carbon Wallet has a bug that makes it generate non-standard transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:27:43
It takes computing power to generate addresses and checking them against the blockchain. Since the probabilities are so astronomically small you'd make more money using the computer for mining.
@_date: 2013-03-04 14:39:40
I've just updated the plugin to fix some bugs people were encountering. Please try the latest version (0.2) if it doesn't work.

I get a feed with one entry saying "No feed here or temporary problem"...

It seems that SHA1 is the default for shasum on my box.
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:12:16
Also, bitcoin-qt will normally hang for a few minutes when you import the private key because it has to do a rescan.

Same problem in Denmark. I was asked by Bitstamp support to print one of the electronic documents and then have it verified for authenticity by a notary.

It seems to me that their argument is that the four miners being rational would form a single pool to maximize their revenue under "selfish mining".

Generic button here: 
And someone else made a similar thing here: 
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:24:06
What you're saying then is that the problem isn't really the bitcoin foundation, but uninformed users/miners.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:49:26
Yes, the same address had been sitting in my wallet as well. I can see the 5 coins having been deposited and disappearing shortly after.
@_date: 2013-05-12 09:36:28
Apparently not:

At the wikipedia page one simple approximation is listed: p = 1.0 - exp(-( 10^11*2 )/( 2*2^256 ))
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:51:32
If the key should be compatible with the generator at bitaddress.org you need to run "echo -n 'password' | sha256sum". It is also possible to avoid having the password in the history and on the screen with: "read -p 'Password&gt; ' -s f; echo; echo -n $f | sha256sum; unset f".

I'm wondering if there is any web page that lists the average fee paid for the transactions in the last X blocks?
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:27:26
The output to 14yLHsCUBRJ9ezRPRzQ4qFCBX1LCNiuuZn has a value of 0 BTC according to the transaction info on the blockchain.info page. IIRC transactions like this are not included by most miners.
@_date: 2013-07-24 18:40:57
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:42:44
That's pretty nice. The blockchain.info stats seem to be generated from the last 24 hours.

I haven't seen any plugins that work specifically as you request, but there are at least a couple of wordpress plugins for bitcoin donations. For example I wrote a shortcode plugin a while ago ( Perhaps you can adapt it to your needs.

It is a mistake by Carbon Wallet I'd think, to generate such a transaction. Here we see how the current version of the client considers this kind of transaction non-standard: 
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:18:09
Your transaction includes a zero valued output. I'm not sure if that is going to be accepted.
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:14:22
A while ago I wrote a plugin for wordpress to do something like this 
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:14:00
SHA-256 could theoretically be replaced with any other strong cryptographic hash function in case a weakness is found.
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:02:10
 It seems that they didn't fix this yet.
@_date: 2013-05-12 15:09:41
And the OPs transaction was also confirmed so yes, it seems that some miners accept them.
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:26:05
No, no, people who say this don't know what they're talking about. The complete source code is available here  with history all the way back to v0.1.5. Bitcoin is an innovative combination of a bunch of existing technologies, but it is in no way otherworldly. The encryption is completely standard, there's nothing new here.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:07:36
So I can't get a preview? Also, please be aware that you shouldn't rely on input addresses. It won't work for people using online wallets.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:12:08
You can make a fork on github and try to convince people that your version is better. Nobody is stopping you.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:50:17


public branch, nullifying the sel fish pool's lead, the pool immediately publishes its private branch (of length 1). This yields a toss-up where either branch may
Is this really a valid assumption? Wouldn't the block published first win in most cases?
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:13:54
You'll have to export your private key(s) from blockchain.info, and then import the private keys into bitcoin-qt using the command "importprivkey" from the debug console.
@_date: 2013-03-02 22:07:08
I have been thinking about turning it into a generic script that could be added to any page. One issue is that the button requires some server side support to show the numerical info on the right.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:29:53
I'd actually like to see some forks. Right now it seems that bitcoin-qt/bitcoind is trying to be a good client for every kind of user (miners/newcomers/power users/etc), and therefore failing to be a really good client for anyone.
@_date: 2013-03-02 10:41:12
If you add the shortcode to your posts you can use a different address for each one. However I like this idea of automatically generating a new address, perhaps I'll implement it at some point.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:39:26
There has been some discussion recently about a scheme for this  It is a controversial issue though.
@_date: 2013-03-09 23:45:05
Nice project, but is it really based on Bitcoin? It seems to me that it is inspired by it, but it is a system that is completely separate from Bitcoin as far as I can see, no?
