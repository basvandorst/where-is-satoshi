If you want a young, smart, recent graduate from the top of his Chemical Engineering class, I would love a career change! I work for Schlumberger in the oil biz, but come to find out, my passion is investing and finance! I have owned Bitcoin fora little over a year now, let me know if you would consider looking at or sending out my resume.

I use it with all my college roomates to pay each other back for stuff. It works like a god damn miracle, just buy back the coins you send to your friend so he doesn't pillage your bitstack of course.

my roomates and i all work offshore for weeks at a time and never see each other. should have added that part haha

Yaaa, transactions too slow to buy eGifter with... 15min. invoice address expires before transaction can go through.. fucking bullshit
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:35:16
Thank you sir
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:34:29
Thank you, I had a feeling Chinese miners were the culprit, welp time to move everything over the ETH!
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:05:42
Nope just eGifter via bread wallet and a hefty ~6% tx fee, whooppee!

as an american now traveling through south america, i can tell you that there is a substantial black market in argentina where i can get triple the exchange for USD. I'm not surprised this is happening.
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:00:48
Thanks, this is good to know, i guess i'll just pretend i don't own the extra btc's
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:42:51
alt coins encourage the stability of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:10:31
@_date: 2013-09-05 12:38:43

@_date: 2013-06-16 18:39:17
i heard 10 of their dollars per USD, where the banks only give 5 per USD, so double in the black market. In venezuela, it is currently 22 pesos per usd, where the bank only gives 6 or so. So venezuela's is pretty ridiculous
