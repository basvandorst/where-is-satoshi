Sure I do. Economics is a field of science devised to complicate and convolute the act of theft so that people don't even realize they are being victimized.

Man, I wish everybody was as "not into bitcoin" as you. We'd come a lot farther a lot faster if that were the case.

This. I went "all in" last summer at $600. Now I really wish I hadn't. Not because I'm down currently, but because I could have gotten so much more coin for my $$. At least spread it out over the next couple months. If it dips, buy more. If it shoots up, hold back. Timing the market, while ill-advised for your typical long-term investment, can be fruitful for a volatile investment like bitcoin.

By what metric do you determine when block size will be relevant? Are you able to forecast when the next global financial crisis will occur? What if another Greece comes along and decides to take a serious look at bitcoin as a solution? Will it get passed over based on its current limitations?

The blockchain knows all, sees all. Bitcoin is not anonymous. It's not even pseudo-anonymous, if you are misbehaving enough to get noticed. So existing laws against tax evasion are all you need to bust tax evaders. They'd be doing the prosecutor a favor, leaving such a sloppy digital breadcrumb trail.

He has a process patent on the method by which the drug can be manufactured. If you can figure out how to make it cheaply, without infringing on this method, you can market and sell it yourself, under a different brand of course.

No, regulation is saving the little guy from getting fucked over by big banks and big pharma... Right?

I must have read it wrong then. Apologies for spreading misinformation.

He didn't say that bitcoin was useless for Greece. He said it was too late. Meaning that once you find that your fiat savings have been frozen, it's too late to decide that it was a bad idea to have your savings tied up in a government controlled currency. This doesn't make the situation in Greece less relevant to bitcoin. Anyone who was paying attention to what was happening over there should be at least somewhat concerned and interested in any possible alternatives.

Eventually, based on the way things are going, 8GB will be a very small number. Like, a few minutes of ultra HD video. The question is, will technology outpace this advancement across the board? I lack the knowledge to answer that question. How far in the future are we talking? What is the current rate of global broadband adoption? How quickly are currently speeds advancing?

You should apologize for that statement.

You only have to pay for early confirmation, which should be less important for smaller amounts.
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:26:16
I don't know. I see bitcoin acceptance becoming ubiquitous in the much nearer future than a decade. Once it can be used just about anywhere, for just about any thing, adoption will explode. I'd say wihin a decade, perhaps the lion's share of the progress happening in the next 3-5 years.

I feel like these privacy initiatives for bitcoin and other cryptos should be kept well under the radar until mass adoption cements inevitability. We are almost certainly heading down that road today (regulation as opposed to criminalization) mainly because the powers thay be have been convinced that it can be policed.

You guys just keep chugging away at it. It'll take a while, but the implementation will be felt in a big way, I'd wager.
