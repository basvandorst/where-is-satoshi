over 95% of all bitcoins in circulation are owned by about 4% of the market. In fact, 1% of the addresses control half the entire market. 
Each address can represent more than one individual person. An obvious example would be a bitcoin exchange or wallet, which hold the currency for a lot of different people. Another limitation has to do with anonymity. If you want to remain completely anonymous, you can use something called CoinJoin, a process that allows users to group similar transactions together. This makes it seem like two people are using the same address, when in reality they are not.

Since no one knows what happened, people began to propose their own theories. Some say that Roger Ver, the main promoter of BCH and founder of Bitcoin.com, could have returned to BTC, others have suggested that Ver sold the account for a lot of money, while others say that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey could be behind all this, because of his investment in Lightning Labs, developer of Lightning Network.
