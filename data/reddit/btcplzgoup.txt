I make a watch only wallet on my win10 pc with electrum 3.xx...latest version.
The watch only is based on the pub key.
It sees the funds.
I make a transaction.
I then go to TAILS and have tried EVERYTHING.
bottom line...load transaction from file and try to sign it with private key BUT the sign button always stays greyed out.
I tried this a year ago and it worked flawlesly but now i can't figure it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:08
you make an unsigned transaction from a watch only wallet.
It allows you to do the signing on an offline computer that will never ever in the history of the universe see the internet. It makes the offline computer do the things you would normally now do with a hardware wallet like a ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:49:31
would you happen to know if this is normal for electrum not being able to sign these transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:23

@_date: 2017-12-14 08:50:24
Is it solved?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:54:00

Unless they find a way to get precomputed private keys into their SEED=&gt;private keys generator code without it being detectable through third-party code revision...it's impossible for them to do so.
They could also inject different addresses for you to send your money to without you knowing...but then again...it would be pretty obvious if that were to have been ever the case.
The blockchain would show you where the money went and it wouldn't take many victims before the scam was widely know...This could happen when you use newer unreviewed software but as it stands now armory, electrum, multibit...are trusted and you can even check their signatures for legitimacy of downloaded software.

Hi thanks for VLC...it's the best on windows PC's.
I donated because i saw the link here on reddit...but why don't you guys put it on the homepage donation tab?

I try to persuade as many people as i can that you should see beyond the speculative vessel it is to most that have heard "something" about it...but try to explain that the technology is a network that converges to consensus and try to make them see the incredible potential.
I'm not smart enough to see the future really so i blatantly reuse everything andreas antopoulos says.
I also try to give as many people as i can a millibit on their android. Having them see the ease with which a TX can be made spikes interest...the increase in value which we -let's be honest- hope for might spike their interest too after a while.
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:23:16
Got a message from them on facebook after i complained openly on their page. I couldn't help but be a whiny bitch about this...companies need to take other people's money more seriously!

I have been thinking of donating to wiki for quite a few times yet never did..I don't do a lot of paypal and visa on the web. It's always a hassle...you never remember your password or where you put that visa card.
You always have your phone with you...i would have donated multiple times if you accepted bitcoin. Regardless of wetter there is a big bitcoin accepted sign or not. I really don't see why wiki wouldn't.

@_date: 2014-02-17 12:42:14
Am I doing it right?
I had to be at the entrance selling tickets this weekend for a party (about 800 people). The party was organized by the brother of my girlfriend. Before i arrived I thought..why don't I except BTC. It was a last minute thing and nothing was on the flyer. I just printed the "bitcoin accepted here" logo and put it by the register. I figured i'd just use my android wallet on my phone as i actually didn't anticipate many people having btc. If there was somebody that paid his 10 euro entrance to me in btc i would just pay the organisation 10 euro myself and end up having 10 euro worth btc.
Sadly nobody actually did have btc at the party. I got some surprised people and inquisitive ones...and as always i gave away several satoshis to random people after installing an wallet on their phone just to get word out and have as many people  at least a little interested. But it made me question what the best way is to do this without a third party.

BTW what you suggest wouldn't work...giving somebody a paper wallet is just giving them access TOO...if you copied the keys on it...you still have access.

@_date: 2014-12-12 09:04:01
The air gap means an offline system knows the keys...it can sign transactions and an online computer can send the signed transaction on the bitcoin network (the internet...well...a small part of people on it).
The online computer never knows the private key.
It is a cumbersome system that will not stay like that when more innovation is introduced or more people start investing in things like TREZOR which pushes the price for those innovations down.
I have the equivalent of 50-100 usd on my phone...well...sometimes...i buy pizza and chinese food with that amount and sometimes recharge it or use it to donate to people showing how easy bitcoin can make things.
If my phone is stolen i will NOT lose that money! I have the SEED that mycellium wallet gives me so when my phone is stolen i have time to secure those funds.
Chances are still slim for anybody that steals a phone to try to break my log in pattern and then also know my 6digit mycellium pin...so basically they won't be able to steal anything.
A piece of code or malware COULD probably steal those funds...
I haven't heard of mycellium wallets being depleted unwillingly though.
@_date: 2014-04-18 07:49:21
I already cut them slack two times before while testing the system and then actually using them to sent a friend a gift. Both times it was incredibly slow and you would have to wait hours for the email to show up in the recipients mailbox. 
They could have sent me a mail about them acknowledging having technical problems instead i got a generic mail stating they are looking into it.  
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:11:46
I had this too...bitstamp allowed me to resubmit my info and turned of the 2FA after having recieved everything they needed to verify.
It IS a concern to me since then...that that actually is kind of dangerous...was very happy to get back in though.
Good luck

@_date: 2014-10-10 10:25:26
first buy at 999usd...never sold...only bought more, averaging at 630 now. Never bought at really low lows either...which isn't optimal.
I AM a believer...still i feel that making money while going down through shorts etc. isn't necessarily being a traitor either.
I do feel that when i didn't for example have a day job i wouldn't be feeling badly for trying to game the system. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 08:37:31
Bought more minutes after thinking i was gonna sell what I bought at 340 and 360...Don't know what happened.
Hindsight wise it seems logical now to think that the rally to 450 went way to quick to be anything but a very artificial run up from few instigators and a lot of panic buyers. I was one of those hehe...
At least I average BELOW 600 usd now...that used to be 999 usd one day...about a year ago :).
It's an addictive thing...greed

And they still have to steal your trezor! 
The pattern should change every input though..that would make it really safe
@_date: 2014-11-19 09:01:03
If they have a fast strategy to get the money...a very fast chain of double spends could get more out than what the single spend could have generated...but yes...they'd kill their income and make all their gear worthless...
That being said, the CATO guys said something along the lines of...when you are a miner and you're gear is getting too old to keep on generating profit...In that situation you might be tired of it all and just go what the heck...let's go out gloriously and do that double spend. The thing is either ALL miners in a pool would have to have the exact same gear AND exact same electricity cost to have that feeling at the exact same time for it to be feasible for a whole pool to unite like that.
On the other hand...the Cato people said a lot of worthwhile things imo...i'm not sure how to "counter" for example the fact that mining doesn't benefit from economics of scale...
I've read some times that for a single miner there is a sort of optimum amount of hashes and when trying to go over that the ROI goes down.
I don't see how that can happen. If you ARE a big entity already you must be able to get better rates when the next asic comes along and you do already have big copper for electricity and big data throughput etc...
In that way i'm a little nervous beause to me it does seem mining tends towards centralization.
I hope i'm wrong because i'm quite heavily invested at 590 usd avg.

I want to clarify that the thing is most online stuff can be subject to phising schemes much like online banking can be hacked into...people think they are logging into the real thing while actually they are giving away their password.
Do you know 2factor authorization ?
You should try to read up on that too!!!
Basically IF your accound gets hacked and a hacker knows your password he or she will still need acces to something else to be able to steal anything. 2FA! Look into it!
btw...you can now also have what they call hardware wallets like for example the trezor. 
IMO they are PERFECTLY safe because they can not be hacked AT ALL. Word is still out on this device because it IS open source so the creators can't do anything with it without the community knowing their bad intentions...a small portion of the device isn't open source however and they've been given a lot of grief for that.
I feel though that trezor is perfectly safe.
(can be compared to small hardware things your bank gives you to do online banking with...well at least where i live)

no...he is implying buying bitcoin is dumb and the value will now only go down...this MIGHT be the case...It might also be the greatest revolution in monetary history and bitemperor will be a sad he didn't buy coins when they were dirt cheap...like now. 
Most of us agree that it's either one of two things...they will go VERY low or very HIGH but can't stay at this value for very long.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:04:19
That's the thing...i think android wallet does a weighted average over x amount of time right? I guess even solutions like overstock do it like that but through coinbase. But they never really see the btc right?
What do small shops etc. do? Just pull btc to their wallet, maybe one that's not physically there? (they could have stolen my phone that night and if they were faster unlocking my phone some how than i was pulling the funds from the back upped wallet, they would effectively have stolen everything made that evening)
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:01:25
There is an error in the paper there...it says hasing power appr. halves each month while it obviously increases...It's just a typo though.
Seeing it does NEVER make sense to continue mining under loss the system should be self-regulatory no?
Why mine at a loss to pay back electricity when you can just stop using the electricity in the first place...and if you did it for the coin to appreciate over time, you could have bought it in the first place at lower price.
@_date: 2014-08-01 08:28:06

It's all good...now the initial excitement over sniffing Coke of models asses is over i genuinely feel it will come back and start to really know the protocol and see why all the enthusiasm of andreas ant. and other evangelists is rightful.

for the advent of commercially available trezors is there?
I want one! Though 2 btc is a bit steep :)
@_date: 2014-04-17 11:10:38
well...if it does arrive i still wouldn't recommend the service to anybody. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:41:47
too bad i have everything in cold storage then and can't easily sell now to rebuy back in.

There are ways for bitcoin to be perfectly safe.
For example: a paper wallet.
What isn't safe is giving your coins to a third party that has custody over them or worse, trust them to have bitcoins for you while actually there aren't any.
It's all a bit strange at first but try to read up on paper wallets to put a bigger number of bits on if you see them as an investment and for small amounts just to do small purchases with on the net and for getting to know the system i would advice mycellium for android devices.
Good luck.

Everything should be synced...it says so.
The public address it says that private key is linked to is the right one!
Scratching my head???

I really like this videa as a means to get people interested....but it seems they're promising too much...at least saying bitcoin does things as does not do as of now.
I get the whole turing complete ethereum thing but i've never really quite understood how both ethereum and bitcoin can work together..can they? I mean...are they supposed to?
There was this whole buy ethereum shares or something. I didn't get that. Is it an alterbative to bitcoin or an addition?

Well...the site doesn't allow doing so...it just gives you the option to put an address there (which doesn't even fit in the visible part of the box...so badly designed...tsss).

Not that half a year ago i'd think i'b be happy with that but still...there you go.
Anything to do with the tipping?
I've been tipping on youtube for a while now and at least on my tips only bitcoin related stuff gets it and redeems the tip. Other people haven't been reacting :/

Sent what i had on my phone (only 1.5usd)
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:18:49
that's the thing...a lot of the software IS open source...if they had malicious intents it would be obvious.
the problem always is that you need people taking on the responsibility to actually do the revision of the open source stuff...But you can trust armory etc...
I am in the process of putting my btc on paper wallets and leaving some on my phone in either mycellium or bitcoin wallet for android...
Paper wallets created on a linux usb stick without networking through an offline version of the bitaddress site with bip38 encrytion.
mycellium on android can excess those paperwallets... so you just put all you have on maybe ten addresses and you print wallets for maybe ten more...and every time you need btc to buy something or to pay someone AND your stash on your phone or other less secure place runs out...you grab a paper wallet and move whatever you need spendable on your pc or phone and put the remainder on the next paper wallet.

Suffice to add that i lost more now than what i gained a couple of weeks ago!
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:41:58
Well...it might also have been the fact that 1000 BTCEUR came along
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:40:58
Well...if the shares do hit the market...they actually might...altough with the current run up ..they won't for long.
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:10:52
well...the thing is...a paper wallet isn't made to spent from...it is what it is...a sort of vault for the coins you don't want to move around. A sort of savings account. Moving those coins in theory compromises the safety and you should never spent from a paper wallet without moving everything to a new SAFE paper wallet.
You can also spent from a paper wallet though if you have an offline computer that creates transactions. 
It gets weird and complicated at first.
I only have paper wallets....very few coins on an exchange WITH 2FA!! and some coins on my phone for paying food with.
I can't comment on anything else....but a lot of people here have coinbase and circle and what not accounts with zero problems because of 2FA
I do not know of ANY 2fa protected coins that have been stolen but i might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-02-21 08:49:05

I always try to explain things with torrents and some song everybody likes and downloads...but someone decides to replace that song with a justin Bieber song. By chance the bieber song that has been maliciously given the wrong title (the title of the song people DO want) could end up being the most downloaded...the network failed to reach consensus.
Replace that song with a .txt file full of IOU's...and tell them that this network WILL reach consensus...

Bloomberg Terminal is the most expensive among financial data providers, costing $24,000 per year. For customers with two or more subscriptions Bloomberg charges $20,000 per year. By comparison, a fully loaded version of Eikon costs $1,800 per month, with a bare bones version costing a mere $300 per month.

Percentage profit of loss or the same over the whole scale because multiplication in linear scale is addition in log scale.
There fore, if times 1.5 equals an increase by 50 percent is say one inch on your screen, It's one inch over the entire range.
 + You can see detail before 2013. Mostly the percentage thing though.
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:40:52
yeah what's happening?

This seems serious :/
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:47:59
that is true...i keep saying to myself that at least with the little coins i have on an exchange, i should try to game these drops. 
Have a sensible stop loss and and alarm to wake you up to buy back in low...
I don't know...it always seems so simple

(I don't like short shits)
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:57:33
yeah...i was planning on doing that...it just seems silly that i haven't put the paper wallet in small amounts. I have one big address.
IF*** it goes wrong....it goes wrong horribly :/

I made the paper wallets in a similar way. There isn't need for this second machine to actually be a physical machine now is there?
I can just close my win10 pc and boot it with tails (which i assume is a linux distro?) as long as i unplug the utp. Right?
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:06:59
And how about running Tails in a virtual machine that can't access the internet? Is that scary because of some keylogger maybe eaves dropping, listening for private keys?
Is that a thing?
@_date: 2016-12-03 10:24:23
Tails actually says so on the website that that isn't intended use and that indeed a keylogger on the OS the virtual machine runs on could just as easily log keystrokes.
@_date: 2019-08-18 10:40:24
i too assume it is...still weird no? What would somebody want out of this?

seriously though...i saw the actual sell at the top of one of those spikes a friend of mine had her bitcoin sold while my "testsell" and another friends testsell was completely overlooked.
It's like the tradingengine is broken and wants to find the HIGHEST instead of the LOWEST bid on the buy side

We all three have limits sells and while mine and the other friends sells are just blazed past...the third actually had her sell go through!
She sold at 2210 EURBTC and bought immediatly back in at 2083
This is fishy as fuck

Who knows the developers?
Can't we page them?
Surely they must know this would backfire?

well...transactions are off chain when they're on the exchanges and those drive the price.
