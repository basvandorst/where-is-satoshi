I think that big email providers, as well as other big business, do not store your password as you typed it on their servers. What they do is when you type your password they change it in certain predictable way (eg. by adding "abc" in front of it) and then they make hash from result. Hash function as well as changing procedure of password are secrets. Result is what they store and compare when you type in your pass each time. This way if database gets hacked they can still reverse engineer your pass and create new database.

Ok fair question.
Stocks are high as result to prolonged credit bubble and hyperliquidity as result of prolonged low interest rates. Everything bubble. Stocks can collapse only if there is sudden loss of trust in credit structure. Similar to 2008. crisis. This can/will happen if FED continues to tighten. But I don’t think they will go that route. If they do they will be forced to reverse the course and lower interest rates and prop credit structure with new QE. They can not allow widespread panic and bancrupcies, that is no option.
Edit: TLDR stock may or may not collapse, we are in the dead end street. No way out, end is the same - collapse of faith in fiat credit structure.

We could wait for a long time before that. Logic goes like this: BTC trading is not regulated. So nothing can heppen to them if they use internal info for personal trades.

Reward halving every four years will halve mining incentive as well. Long term, energy consumption will not be a problem even with btc price much higher than now.
Mid term, before halvings do their part, bitcoin energy mining requirement will push for usage of cheap remote electricity, therefore acting as electricity price mediator that will help energy development in remote areas. Further, it will probably incentivise construction and development of new cheap energy technologies that will be deployed in remote areas.
It will not raise energy price in areas that are densely populated.

Our situation is bit more complex than simple **two point** fiat-for-goods and goods-for-fiat exchange cycle. Here we have **three point** goods-for-bitcoin-for-fiat triangle (as well as other triangle combinations). 
But to cut to the bottom of the thing - **yes, velocity of bitcoin use on purchases does influence it's price** relative to other two exchange entities (fiat and goods). And more so than in two-point cycle, since our cycle needs to do one more additional step, bitcoin-to-fiat, to neutralise disbalans.
There is **race between bitcoin merchant addoption and bitcoin user addoption**. This year merchants were progressing stronger. This is reflected in price of bitcoin.

The analytic you pointed out is skewed toward small addresses, therefore distribution it presents is not realistic (same owner can have huge number of small addresses).

I agree. Also, there may be variable fee amount, so that total transaction with fee included can not be smaller than, say, 5 cent. 
For example: if spamer is sending minimal ammount his fee will be 5 cent, if somebody is sending 3 cents his fee wil be 2 cents, if somebody is sending 5 cent, his fee will be minimal.

Using the money is necessary for it to eventually become reserve currency. Only once it has spread over majority of market it can hope to solidify on pole position. Reserve currency is nothing but a recognition of its usefullness (usefull properties). 
Crypto market has only started to form. Nothing is solidified yet. The most usefull solution will prevail. Bitcoin network effect is fragile at best.

Correct. Sound money is mass agreement of healthy type. Only non-sound money (unlimited supply, eg. fiat money) belongs to sub-group of “mass delusion”.
Historically there were sound money types that eventually became non-sound money due to technological progress (sea shells, stone rings,..) that eliminated supply restrictions. Gold could go that path if asteroid harvesting becomes a thing.

So, ECB is creating €80bn each month. This is newly created money.
With this *printed* money they buy government bonds of euro-area governments (19 countries out of 28 EU members). This is pushing bond price up and pushing bond yields lower (bond price is reverse related to bond yield), which is good for debtors (governments) but is bad for savers, pension funds etc (since they can't yield almost anything on their savings and bond investments).
ECB is now broadening its economy management into private sector company bonds. They will start buying private debt with newly created money. Is this good?
Yes, it is great if your mayor net worth is into company assets (stocks), but again it is bad for savers, pension funds, etc. since saving is not paying off at exact same time when money is being diluted by fiat owners (central bankers).

"26. Among the G-SIBs (Globally Systemically Important Banks: DeutscheBank HSBC CreditSuisse JPMorgan GoldmanSachs BankOfAmerica BNPParibas Santander BankOfNYMellon MorganStanley SocGen CreditAgricole WellsFargo Citigroup Nordea Commerzbank StateStreet UniCredit UBS RBS Mitsubishi Barclays StandardChartered Sumitomo ChinaConstructionBank ICBC BankOfChina INGBank Mizuho), Deutsche Bank appears to be the most important net contributor
to systemic risks, followed by HSBC and Credit Suisse (Figure 15). In turn, Commerzbank, while
an important player in Germany, does not appear to be a contributor to systemic risks globally. In
general, Commerzbank tends to be the recipient of inward spillover from U.S. and European G-SIBs.
The relative importance of Deutsche Bank underscores the importance of risk management, intense
supervision of G-SIBs and the close monitoring of their cross-border exposures, as well as rapidly
completing capacity to implement the new resolution regime."

Also, since private key can generate many public keys, is it possible to somehow send (sign transaction) from new "nonexistent" public address?
Also, public address is not really public until there is signed outhoing transaction. It is unknown, only hash of that address is known.

Yes, but only if transaction reward (TR) is not included. In mid-term future TR will become larger than new mined bitcoin value. Therefore, value of energy that will be used for mining will ever more corelate with TR value, not bitcoin value. 
Example: bitcoin can be at, say, 10.000$, TR value at 90% of total mining reward, and market price of one bitcoin would be 10 times higher than its actual cost of mining.

Problem with futures is they take buying liquidity from actual market into artificial paper market. They create fake supply of btc. If you are interested in BTC don’t use futures. Use normal exchanges and withdraw your BTC to your wallet. That is purpose of btc, to be your own bank.

Reserve currency status is relative term. There are several of them, some with higher status than the other. It is awarded by broad market, including geopolitical and trading aliances as well as personal decisions.
Due to divisive nature of geopolitics, I don't think bitcoin can be outlawed. Even in that scenario, some goverments will approve it for sake of making their adversary position worse off.
Bitcoin is finnancial asset, but unlike stocks it is primary money. It must have ecosistem supporting this money function. If this ecosistem doesn't develop it will not be too usefull to people and something else will take the pole position. This is why we need scaling solution.

Let’s imagine this is doable (practically it isn’t). What would happen to pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and saving as such?
Those institutions are forced to buy government and private debt by legal obligation. Debt would yield negatively so pensioners (pension funds), savers and general public (sovereign wealth funds) would get thoroughly rekt. They would be poorer after 12 months of forced “investing”.
Ok, let’s assume they can change their legal obligations to avoid investing in debt and invest only in other asset classes. What is left to invest in if debt is not the option? Mainly stocks and realestate. Surprise surprise, we are seeing this already happening.
This process pumps bags of stock option holders (1%-ers who have bonuses in stock options) and wealthy individuals (0.1% have their wealth in stocks and realestate) while at the same time is makes middle class disappear and makes poor poorer. We are already seeing this.
This is dead end streat. Epic shitstorm is coming. Buy bitcoin.

Protocols tend to solidify, yes, but that tends to be the death of them in the long run. New needs emerge eventually.  If existing sollution can't evolve it gets replaced by better one. Network effect doesn't prevent it, only slows it down.
Therefore, if we want bitcoin to be alive in 100 years, or even in 5 years, we must keep it possible to change and evolve.

What you describe here is bad money pushing good money out of circulation. This is normal and expected market behavior. This process will result in rising velocity (inflation) of bad money, and eventual abandonment of bad money. Good money will eventually take over. This happened many time in history and is happening now in Venezuela (dollar being good money there).
To say that money with 0% inflation is horrible is very strong statement that requires very strong argumentation. I think current system is much worse that 0% inflation system would be.
Current system (cheap money policy) benefits big debtors, while punishes savers and pensioners. Check out how retirement funds are doing, you will not like it. Also please check out how big stock/options holders are doing, while their respective companies are borrowing money to buy back their own stock (spoiler: they are doing amazing, never better) while at the same time reducing operation and r&amp;d costs.

Wow. Just wow.
Current “ability to finance debt payments” is result of central banks simply creating fiat currency in recent decade, and buying that same debt with the created currency, pushing yields ever lower and lower. Many countries should have defaulted long time ago, but are simply postponing the day of rackoning.
How is that sustainable? Debt can’t be repaid by printing new fiat. Not in real value. Creditor will maybe get his nominal amount back, but that amount will buy less of the real products. This happened countless times in history. Once creditors (savers, pensioners...) realize what is happening there will be no going back, but currently they are clueless. They will dump what they percieve as risky and buy what they percieve has sustaining value. Bubble will eventually burst.

No. As explained above, we are nowhere near physical boundaries. We are many orders of magnitude far from those boundaries. Will we ever reach them, or will we destroy ourself before is another topic.
Biological boundaries are currently being pushed because our technology is developing slower than our appetite. Maybe this dinamics changes, which should be expected for society with ever growing level of knowledge and technology. But if it doesn’t we will self destruct. If we don’t self destruct before some other way.

In principle, yes, growth can’t go on forever. But we are nowhere near the end of this growth. End of growth is set by laws of phisics, not our current level of technology. We are so far from elemental physical boundaries as caveman is far from our-age technology. Or more. We are currently usung fosil fuels. Do you know how inefficient is this? One gram of matter holds enormous ammount of energy. This energy can be release with sufficient technology, however we are nowhere near that level of technology.

Central bank buying corporate bonds is transfer of wealth

Current system (actually since Nixon closing gold window) is good for debtors and bad for creditors.
Example for creditors: pension funds. Pension funds are severely underperforming in recent decade. How can they reach projected long term 6% growth when interest rates are suppressed for so long? This is bomb in making.
Example for debtors: big stock/option owners (also known as famous 0.1% or 0.01%). Companies are buying back their own stock instead of investing and r&amp;d, sometimes doing it even on credit, figuring that is best way to spend excess liquidity when interst rates are so low it doesn’t make sanse to save and is easy to borrow.
Wealthy people hold biggest percentage of their wealth in stocks and realestate, not in cash.
In Europe inflation is now same or greater than interest on bonds or savings. This is transfer of wealth from savers to debtors.
If 0% inflation all you need to offer savers is 2-3% to attract their funds.

2.85e12 / 4*340e6 = 2095 €
Your math is correct (euro area population is only 340mil since 9 countries are not in it). This includes every single person, not only employed. There are only 158mil employed in euro area.
2.85e12 / 4*158e6 = 3851 €
Therefore it is 3851€ for every employed person in euro area for each of four years 2015-2018.
Average monthly income for euro area is 1750 € (  ). This means that European Central Bank has printed 2.2 monthly salaries every year for single every euro area worker (3851/1750).
**Amount equal to 18.3% of every sallary has been printed by ECB during last four years.**

Actually, mass perception/awarness is what is changing in the first place. Paradigm shift. Risk kinda stayed similar. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:12:22
So what?
Debt to GDP can be understood as measure of risk, leverage of a kind. In case of a economical downturn debt becomes riskier, therefore worth less. Not all debt is equal, but stated is general principle. Debt becomes worth less. How much less depends on severity of downturn and debt exposure to risk, risk being a function of downturn. Therefore vicious circle is created, down spiraling.
Enter central banks. Printing money can temporarly alleviate debt risk since money is cheaper to borrow. Price to pay is rising level of total debt. Therefore problem is not solved but instead “pushed under the rug”. Kicking the can down the road, while the can becomes ever bigger and heavier.
Rising level of debt can be good if economy is growing faster than total debt is rising. Say, your personal total debt rises slower than your ability to repay it (you are getting bigger sellary). This scenario is ok. However, if your debt is rising faster than your ability to repay it, you should be worried.
This is exactly what  debt to GDP measure is showing: risk of inability to repay debt in full (real value, not nominal numeric value).

Fiat is in bubble. All of fiat.
Analogy. Imagine a pressure vessel (something like pressure cooker). Pressure inside this vessel (aka. market forces) is contra balanced by outside pressures (aka. central banks manipulations). Pressure vessel doesn't burst due to contra pressures applied from outside. But inside pressure is rising ever more higher.
Now, two possibilities can bring this system to more stable lower pressure state. First one is safety valve to release pressure from inside (aka. inflation). This is what central banks are unsuccessfully trying to accomplish since 2009. Second one is uncontrollable eruption. As pressure grows this possibility becomes more probable since dynamic of contra-balancing becomes more difficult to perform.

True. Therefore, to asses long term bitcoin dinamic, we should look at most important trends that can be expected as time goes by.
As years goes by bitcoin will become more proven/familiar and less wierd/sketchy technology for everage Joe. Secondly, generational shift is in bitcoin favour. Thirdly, communication technology will progress/spread further and mobiles will be where money is. No cards or paper. Mobiles. Lastly, *actual money* will face mayor hurdles as a consequence of recent, current and future monetary policies where control increase and NIRP can be expected.
It is hard to imagine centralized blockchain that can be trully international, in order to pose realistic threat to bitcoin. Unless world becomes much more separated/isolated and international characteristic of bitcoin becomes less important. We should all hope this scenario doesn't happen.

Something that is twice as valuable should be twice as safe. Bitcoin network can't stay equaly safe if it becomes very valuable (relied upon with big value). Today safety is not sufficient. It all depends on bitcoin success. Or lack of it.
Edit: Maybe value and safety are not linerarly corelated. Maybe it is some logarithmic relation (say, four times as valuable needs to be twice as safe, or some other log base). I bet there are plenty scientific papers on preciselly this topic.

Term "bank run"...hm. Yes, sure, but I am afraid it's biggest purpose is fear conditioning. Actually, in recent times bank run usually happen way after the fact, when bank is already insolvent. So what if weak banks fail? Force them with regulation to be more conservative (Glass-Steagall was that). In case if bank run happens on some bank more conservative bank would take it over for pennies on the dollar, or if not bankruptcy (example: Wells Fargo was more conservative than the others during 2000s so 2008-09 crisis made it comparatively stronger). There must be consequences for (bankers) acts, otherwise environment becomes miss balanced (toxic). Bankruptcies are healthy.
Also, BTC book-keeping has possibility to be way more transparent than fiat book-keeping. Real-time balance sheet watching, or such. Transparency is long-term trend of development. We live in information age.
Also, possible solution could be to decentralize bunk run from risk. Exclude centers of risk from financial system - those are banks. Therefore, direct P2P lending with collateral guarantee.

My guess: they send unique link to your friends mobile. Simple centralized service.
I think this is terrible from privacy point. Your friends mobile phone will be permanently in theirs database, and possibly more. If he uses centralized lightning service (default for BlueWallet) then provider knows who is paying how much to whom. PayPal. Even if they are well intentioned (do we know that?), they can be compromised, bought, persuaded etc.
My biggest issue is: why didn’t they choose email, or some less invasive medium or technique to connect to receipient? Mobile phone numbers should be kept confidential as much as addres of residence, if not more. This is red flag for me.

If you are 50 or older and have some life savings, when do you spend more: if your savings is yielding 1% or 10%? If your saving is yielding next to nothing then you do not touch your savings. You save.
Regarding borowing side of this story, if interest is low you will borrow more in total ammount. But monthly interest payments are determined by your abbility to re-pay your loan, so your monthly repayment ammount will be similar in both cases. This is why low interest inviroment is frutile ground for financial bubbles.

Autonomy, privacy - You can run your nodes (Core+LN) on VPN or Tor if you want autonomy and privacy. You will be able to direct your mobile wallets to your own nodes.
Learning new stuff - It is a learning process to get feel for what it is this all about. Specially if you have money invested you should get on top of this. I am not expert and it took me couple of weeks to set my nodes up, but now I am my own bank. It is a cool feeling.
Since recently there is One-click blockchain+LN setup tool. Easiest ever. If you get stuck you can probably ask the guy for help. (tweeter 
I also recommend “dedicated IP” + VPN (your own public IP address stays fixed). Check out TorGuard VPN provider, they accept LN payments!

2. Open bitaddress.org from your hard drive (you are disconnected from internet now), go to /bulk wallet or /paper wallet tab. Generate as many public+private address pairs as you like. Print them on paper! Also, save them on protected USB stick, than remove that stick from computer. Do not save PRIVATE addresses on your hard drive! You can only save PUBLIC adresses on your comp hard drive.
3. Close all open aps, restart your comp, re-connect to internet.
4. Send some small testing amount to one of your public adresses. Wait for 10-30 min. Than test if that ammount has arrived to your public address (go to blockchain.info and paste your PUBLIC address there).
