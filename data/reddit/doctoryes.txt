That's not structuring and it's completely legal. The problem is that if you have a lot of profit, you're running the risk of the asset you're trying to unload declining in value during the many years it'd take to unload at 36k/year.

I do appreciate Bitcoin, and own a substantial amount. This is a sub about Bitcoin however, not about just pumping Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin sucks for travel unless your idea of fun is picking things to do, places to go, hotels to stay at, restaurants to eat eat, museums to go to, and so on based on what currency they accept. I can't imagine anything lamer or more irritating when I'm traveling, either for business or pleasure. If a currency actually makes my life -less- convenient, I'm not going to use it for that purpose.
Maybe someday global retail acceptance of bitcoin will be a thing, but that day is a long time in the future, if ever. I'm certainly not pinning my hopes for Bitcoin on retail though.

I assume you're trolling, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt once. Because virtually nobody accepts it, and the last thing I want to do while traveling is worry about something as mundane as paying. Change my home currency to whatever currency the country I'm in uses for small incidentals, and then credit card the rest of the time.
Bitcoin for travel is a solution looking for a problem, but it's already a solved problem.

2015, and "random pizza joint accepts bitcoin" is at the top of this sub. You have got to be kidding me.

Sure, it can and maybe it will. But it hasn't changed yet. I'll happily pay 3% currency conversion fees vs. not being able to pay at all because I'm there to travel, not spend &lt;insert currency of choice&gt;.

Bitcoiners love freedom until people use that freedom to say things they don't agree with. See the moderation here for instance.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:36:15
No, you can't. I'll explain.
FIFO = first in, first out. That means that the first coins you bought would be the first ones you sold.
LIFO = last in, first out, meaning the last coins you bought are the first ones you're selling.
The first thing to understand is that it doesn't matter, for tax purposes, what your coins are worth now. You're not taxed on your holdings, but on your profit. That profit (or loss) is generated every time you sell a coin, where 'selling' a coin means selling it for dollars or other cryptocurrency. It also means using it to buy something (that's considered having sold it at whatever today's exchange rate is between btc and USD, if you're in the US, for instance).
So, if you haven't sold any coins, you don't owe any taxes.
Let's say you did though. How do you figure out your taxes?
Let's say that you have 10 coins. You bought 5 of those coins at $100 four years ago, and 5 of those coins at $1000 a month ago.
You now sell a coin for, say, $1200. How much profit have you made?
Well, if you were using FIFO (first in, first out), then that coin you sold would be one of the $100 coins you bought 4 years ago, so you just made a profit of $1100. On the other hand, if you were using LIFO (last in, first out) then the coin you sold is one of the $1000 coins, so your profit is only $200.
However, there's a wrinkle, at least in the US: long-term vs. short-term gains. You pay ordinary income tax rates on short-term gains (assets held for 1 year or less) whereas you pay potentially much-lower tax if you held for at least 1 year and one day (how much lower depends on what your income tax bracket is....the higher it is, the bigger the difference between short and long-term gains in terms of tax).
That's it in a nutshell.

So, why are you on reddit? It is subject to literally thousands of regulations and laws from the old world, and pays taxes to the old world governments too.
Same goes for virtually every product or service you consume or use.
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:31:57
It will only be bigger if it's legal and regulated. That's not an endorsement for regulation, it's just a fact.

I have many community managers that work for me professionally. "Looking good" is not one of the requirements of the job. Your fellow moderators are terrible if not losing face is their major concern.

Yeah. That's the problem: The killer app needs to be something other solutions don't already take care of. I transfer money domestically and internationally multiple times a month for work, and it's simply not an issue. It's already pretty easy.

Been a credit card merchant for 18 years, and also accept Bitcoin.
You've missed the major advantage: people use and have credit cards, in huge numbers. Hardly anyone uses bitcoin. 
Risk of losing payments via fraud is not a con - that's a plus, since it helps customers feel safe spending money. As a merchant, you need the customer a HELL of a lot more than the customer needs you. You won't get very far by forcing the consumer to accept the risk rather than taking it on yourself, particularly when virtually every merchant around you is willing to take that risk of fraud on themselves.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:03:31
Oops, missed the popularity you mentioned, sorry. 
You can always mitigate risk in a variety of ways, but it will still be there. There's no way to get rid of the risk of a merchant ripping off a consumer by not providing what was promised, for instance, and there's no reason that consumers should bear that risk. If a merchant rips me off with a credit card, my card company will simply reverse the transaction. Similarly, if someone steals my card and uses it, someone else pays for it (merchant or credit card issuing bank) - I bear basically no risk as a consumer there.
I don't think Bitcoin will ever be popular as a transactional vehicle in credit-card dominated countries until there's a similar guarantee protecting consumers.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:07:55
Yes, remember: Bitcoin can solve all problems and fiat currencies are the root of everything from dental problems to those dirty dishes in your sink that just won't clean themselves. Do not question the narrative.

But that's just it. Since nobody owns the name, any particular person or group has exactly the same right to run a subreddit with that name as anyone else. 
In a decentralized environment, who do you suggest should decide who gets to run this sub? 
I mean, yes, obviously the current moderation is terrible, but nobody is forcing any of us to keep using this sub. Plenty of other places to discuss bitcoin.

Yes he did. He told you how many btc he has and what percent of his net worth that is. Then he gave you the percent of net worth his home equity makes up. The value of that equity is easily derived from that info.

Sure there are. You may not like those reasons, but there are hundreds of them, from enforcing morality-based rules like prohibitions on murder to enforcing a stable schema for permitting private property to dealing with problems that private enterprise does an inferior job with, like fighting fires. 
Bitcoin's never going to build a criminal justice system. Bitcoin is never going to secure physical property. Bitcoin's never going to put out a forest fire. 
Bitcoin has a 0% chance of replacing governments, because it can't actually perform the vast majority of government functions.
