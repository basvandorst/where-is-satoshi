Bitcoin reminds me of Victor Hugo who had said that no one can stop the idea whose time has come. May be Bitcoin's time has come. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:08:58
Bitcoin will definitely transform the way currencies have been viewed. Let us hope it fares well in coming weeks. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 11:42:15
What is new in it. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 18:57:50
No offenses. English is not what it used to be. British were and still are particular about the uses; however, Hollywood has given a new lingo. Expressions that are able to convey the message are well accepted. Pedantic approach definitely does not add up. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:28:51
hmm, welcome to Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:49:44
The major reason the government agencies hounding Bitcoin is that it is not transparent in its transaction. Hope with this measure, they can be kept silent.  
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:47:33
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:18:14
No problems, but had the BTC ATM existed, the current news story would not be needed. LOL
@_date: 2013-07-24 17:39:59
Bitcoin is now available in Israel too.
@_date: 2013-07-27 16:39:13
I think it should be ""Thus, despite the recent over passing, Bitstamp is far away to become a major challenger, but no one knows in a couple of years, it can surpass Mt. Gox."
What you think?
@_date: 2013-07-24 10:20:53
What is that, no information, just picture! 
@_date: 2013-07-30 03:07:25
Yes, it is always important to read brokers' reviews, I guess. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 11:39:01
Such conferences will definitely people understand the concept behind Bitcoin. Though opposition may come from various segments, particularly the ones who have vested interest in the existing system, Bitcoin should get recognition. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 13:00:58
It will definitely get wide acceptance in the second phase; of course it needs to comply with the laws of the land. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 16:24:22
Cheers! I am sad, I do not know cryptography.
@_date: 2013-07-27 19:23:24
Yes, you have all rights to criticize as a reader.You have given some noticeable objections that the writer must correct to become a thorough journalist. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:04:25
Mt. Gox's people know what to do when pushed by the government. They realize that their business cannot grow undermining the State and its interests. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 05:55:49
Some evangelist technical experts working for a democratic currency, may be. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:36:39
I read the piece and came to conclusion that this is may not entirely be the major reason but one of the reasons. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 05:56:06
Obviously. We are waiting for that. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:50:49
Poor footballers!
@_date: 2013-07-24 09:09:18
But what problem do you have if registering with your original identity. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 06:38:58
Why you need pseudonym? it is not crime, people are going with their original names.
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:31:18
You know these days news is opinion and opinion is news. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 19:42:39
Yes, definitely we can hope. Bitcoin seems the best option against fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 10:05:30
I visited the website, it seems some of the reviews for brokers such as iOption, TraderXP, Plus500, etc. that offer Bitcoin shorting services are informative.  
@_date: 2013-07-24 15:56:02
But all your data is being snooped by the government, was not  PRISM about the same. How long can you protect yourself when the government itself is breaching your privacy. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:30:41
LOL! YOu google it and both are correct. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 11:45:17
The blogs seems an online portal for Forex news and Bitcoin news. I do not see it offers any services. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 05:55:13
May be you would not need that as Bitcoin may be reaching to your city within a year. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:52:38
Finally, some good news for Africa. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:36:41
It is just the beginning for Bitcoin, expecting too much from it is wrong on our part. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 13:52:15
I noticed this broker offers several options with respect to accounts and instruments. Are their any options for newbies like me? 
@_date: 2013-08-04 12:03:23
I wrote a news item about Kipochi founder; it is always good to know about someone who is bringing some change. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:01:38
It will definitely give an edge to all those who attend the conference as they will be able to know the currency and its prospects as well as the challenges. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:28:20
But this film is still in making. If you read the news, it says they are collecting money for that. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:29:34
All new ideas are challenged at the beginning; it is their power that makes them popular. So if Bitcoin's idea is powerful enough, it will definitely win in the end against Finance and Credit Mafia. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 13:17:20
Bitstamp handles 18% of Bitcoin exchanges, it is far away to become a major challenger.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:28:15
[There are white robots.](
@_date: 2013-07-23 06:28:44
is it good for non-Forex sites. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 07:50:27
Best part about Coupa Cafe's transaction process is it does not take more time than what it takes when customers are transacting through their credit card. So customers do not need to wait in line.  
@_date: 2013-07-24 21:07:21
LOL! mickey mouse comment is hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 08:37:00
You may be true but Bitcoin's popularity is increasing and even Bitcoin exchange have started to comply with the existing law. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:32:11
Some people here say he is Satoshi!
@_date: 2013-07-24 10:19:49
The key point in the news is, "if someone wants to operate Bitcoins ATMs, he will need to comply with the regulations that Big Daddy has passed." This seems a major challenge for Bitcoin. The government says, either my my way or high way. It will have to be seen whether Bitcoin ATM sees the light of day. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 15:22:59
It's a great news. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:48:59
LOL! the linguistic skills.
@_date: 2013-07-24 10:45:18
There are several issues with Bitcoin which are being generated by the governments which feel it is being used for contraband activities. As of now, yes, buying them on street seems a better option, 
However, sooner or later Bitcoin will be bought and sold, you will even have Bitcoin ATM as per reports 
@_date: 2013-07-25 08:10:51
You see, now even some cafe house in Palo Alto has started accepting Bitcoin..........
@_date: 2013-07-23 06:28:10
is it good for non-Forex sites. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:04:41
Old is Gold.
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:57:43
The news nowhere says that the ATM exists; it was planned but did not come. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:38:57
Those may be the people who bought Bitcoin when it was trading above 150 and selling them now is definitely a loss. 
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:10:48
Ok, so the law firm accepts Bitcoin but are they for it. I mean are the law firm advocates for it. It must stand for Bitcoin's cause. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 18:23:20
I do not contradict over passing; see the results for the term. The term means surpass; the writer meant to say that BitStamp may over pass Mt. Gox that mean surpass. 
o•ver•pass (n. ˈoʊ vərˌpæs, -ˌpɑs; v. ˌoʊ vərˈpæs, -ˈpɑs)
n., v. -passed -past, -pass•ing. n.
1. a road, walkway, or bridge providing access over another route.
2. to pass over; traverse.
3. to exceed; overstep; transgress.
4. to surpass.
5. to ignore; disregard.
6. to pass over or by. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 10:47:13
Finally, someone is paying attention to Bitcoin's cause. This film will definitely help know about the various aspects, challenges, opportunities for the crypto currency. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:35:50
OK, so that way it is unfortunate. Apologies. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 16:46:08
Excellent point. The BitStamp should focus on it for the sake of users. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 11:48:23
I do not know, but will the Bitcoin ATM will be like the ATM we see or will it be different in nature, I mean feature. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:29:45
So they think they can win battle roping in top lawyers. May be they can but Bitcoin will survive because people are with it. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:38:15
Even some cafe in Palo Alto has started accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-24 14:46:12
Even if Bitcoin ATM are not coming up, if it is accepted widely and openly like Coupa Cafe in Palo Alto which has started accepting Bitcoin from the customers as payment, it will be a better option.
