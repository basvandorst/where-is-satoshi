I unfortunately sold a lot through mtgox in 2012 before the crash (small by today's standards). Still have some left but don't know how many, won't know until my blockchain updates. Fingers crossed!
Edit:  fucking around in 2010....
Edit 2: This was running in the background on my 'gaming' desktop (i7 920). I was 16-17 at the time, and I sold about $20k worth in 2012 @ something like $13/ea. I definitely kept some though so we will see...
Edit 3: Bad news... As of early 2013 (i.e. the end of my big sell-off) I only have 72 bitcoins left. All of these transactions are to mtgox (look up bitcoin price chart for august/sept 2012). All of these transactions came out to ~$20k, which was great then (sold just before crash) but not so good now. I don't feel bad about it though becuase I was 16 and too big a risk to pass up. Looks like I hold on to 72 but I won't know for sure till I sync further. This hard-drive has been 'lost' for at least 2 years so I won't have to sync all the way to present day to find out whether I sold any of the 72. 
Edit 4: Last edit for the day, blockchain still syncing, still more than 2 years behind. Will run it again tomorrow. Whatever happens I'll post my final up to date overview in a couple of days or so on this post in case anyone is still interested.

No? Not sure why you would reach that conclusion!
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:37:17
Yeah, I'm pretty comfortable, but thanks for the heads up. Guess you can never be too careful?
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:40:11
Nah, I've been holding (hodl?ing) for this long, will probably sell half and keep the rest somewhere safe and backed up till I need the cash...
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:52:36
How so? You think someone will break into my house? :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:20:25
Yeah, if you read my post above, I sold a lot in 2012... I'm not claiming I still have all of these in my wallet, just not sure how many I kept and how many I sold at the time. Not sure what you mean by 'bullshit' anyways? In what way? Photoshopped?
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:49:58
It was CGT at the time, and I assume it would still be CGT now.

Not dumb imo. Sure would've been better to hold in hindsight but (as I'm sure you will know if you were involved from 2010) I overnight (as a 16-year old) found out that some random freeware I'd downloaded off 4chan had 'made' me $20k. There was no precedent, there was no widespread knowledge of bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies, there was MASSIVE volatility (as there still is I guess? not been following much). I think it was the right decision to cash out at that stage. Let me tell you having that money in university and while travelling changed my life.
Sure I could be a multimillionaire but... I could've also spent my money on lottery tickets and won that too. I've obviously had a long time to come to terms (!!) with the amount of money that it could have been but I think it was the right decision to sell at that time. Seems like I kept ~70BTC so I had SOME appetite for risk/gambling... just not $20k at 16.
I'm sure you were in a similar boat... don't beat yourself up over it. Nobody knows the future.

See my post, was CPU mining on the bitcoin client (there was only one.. something like bitcoin.exe?). In fact it was enabled by default, you just loaded it up and it mined in the background. I had an i7-920 (which I'm still using).

Well... unfortunately not a very glamorous story... I was 15/16 and browsing 4chan... I guess thinking racism was funny as a teen paid off?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:03:38
Not sure what this means - I've been out of the bitcoin loop for a long time? Could you explain?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:42:59
Ah ok. See above for a new screenshot with this reddit post in it. I guess you could also reverse image search if it bothers you? Not sure why people get so indignant and upset about internet points!
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:14:11
Yeah, tell me about it. The other issue was dealing with the tax people. Nobody had really heard of bitcoin at that point beyond a few newspaper articles about buying pizza.

Yeah I had issues withdrawing. There was a ~$1000 daily limit, so I made something like 12 accounts and withdrew all in parallel. It took more than 6 months for all of the wire transfers to come through.
By the way, all 12 accounts were registered to the same email address. If any of you received the mtgox spam/legal documents/phishing... I got 12 times that all to the same inbox!

I haven't actually followed the proceedings because I got all my money out way before they went bust. Sorry to hear you're having issues...
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:37:15
And what? $70k isn't that much money in the grand scheme of things. Walk through the centre of any major city; most houses you see have significant assets inside in plain view. That does not mean they are magically going to get robbed!
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:25:15
I do. However, and I don't mean to be rude because I know I'm in the BTC subreddit, but... why would anyone care about this? I understand from a "that's cool" perspective, but who would pay money? Seems a bit far-fetched but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:50:31
Yeah, this was in 2012, there weren't many options!
