Wait, what happened with that?
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:23:37
It was a credit buy but thanks (:

Pfft still waiting on a buy I did 5 days ago maybe handle old orders first.

Jesus Christ what a community

Well I guess technically it would lower the price for a short time. But the demand is there to buy it all over a couple weeks. Look at the volume per 24 hours on coin market cap.

That's...not how it works. You can always get paid at current price, there is shit tons of demand on exchanges.
Only time you would have to settle for a smaller price is with a tiny cryptocurrency, not the big daddy.

Nah, but you can just deposit your PayPal cash to your bank account then buy..

Like a rock and Marty fan has any to begin with, way to smart for humanity.

I guess I could see that mindset if he doesn't really understand BTC. Even the safest investment crypto-wise has higher returns than 1%. But maybe he likes the "certainty". People fall for MLM all the time, this is just another form of it.

Oh they are.

Don't pretend you're not Vitalik with longer hair bro

Gdax charges minimal fees. Only paid $4 for a $1300 ETH buy.

I don't think these guys understand living with a productive woman XD

Nope only trezor has the holographic and micro welding. Ledger seems easier to use. Ledger is inherently secure, especially if you repeatedly wipe.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:16:23
Why in the world would someone do that instead of just buying bitcoin? That's just weird.

Seriously. Will it go back up? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m tired of hearing people hate on sellers, and yelling “REEE bull run incoming boys!” Like anyone knows what’s happening. Confirmation bias at its best, I guess.
