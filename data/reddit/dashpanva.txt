Hope you will share results. I respect people who learn more about cryptoworld. Then you also can make research about Svandis, this project is revolutionary and fast-developing

I glad to know that this market is growing. We will not see only more new ICO projects, but also the development and new results of existing ICOs. For me the best are VeChain, NEM and Akropolis. First two have already succeed in a manner, but I think Akropolis will be even better than them. Because Akropolis is developing a platform for crypto markets to provide leading financial research, analytical and visualisation tools for professional short-term and long-term traders, analysts, hedge funds, institutional investors, proprietary trading firms, venture capital funds, token sales contributors, exchanges and other participants in the crypto space.

I prefer investing to trading. I've traded onnly Bitcoin. And most of all I like long-term investments in such projects as Iota or Akropolis. Akropolis is young but still very useful and promising project. It is a technology platform designed to address deep-seated structural issues of the global pensions sector. It is designed to be a multi-jurisdictional platform for the delivery of pensions, social welfare and future benefits in a portable manner, that over time brings together individual end users and large institutional players in a new system of incentives

Don't you think that you will lose a lot of money if you don't invest in Bitcoin now? Do you really think that your Vechain and Credits will be exist in next years?

More rich than Bitcoin? But okay, I made research about your projects and they seem really useful for our future. BUT only in one case - if they will be survive in competition after mainnet, especially Credits

I believe that revolution is coming soon. Revolution in all the world \- acception of crypto and blockchain, and revolution in cryptoworld \- insane number of 1 mln  tps, that will open more possibilities in many spheres of our lives, first of all in financial sphere. And I bet on Credits project in this case, too.
Several reasons for it: \- team does its work and delivers as promised, don't use hype to promote their project, but try to prove with their hard work that Credits is really worth to invest in.
\- Use of Autonomous Smart Contracts.
\- Use of unique consensus type \(dPoS\+BFT features\).
\- High transaction speed.
\- Low fees.
\- Reliable and serious partners such as Nitin Gaur from IBM \(no porn for hype, etc\).
\- Participating in many meetings all over the world.
\- Listing on many exchanges.
\- Really secure platform.
And some other reasons.

Do you mean Nitin Gaur? For partners

Wow, these news really impressed me. It's a little bit strange to know that blockchain future is already here. And that Credits one of the first companies that started it...

I've already said visa to go to hell xDD Really. And I'm one of such people who thinks that in the future people will use only crypto. That's why I have a really big investment portfolio. And most of all trust in success of Credits and Vechain, because they offer really cool ideas how to change the world with blockchain. One of examples \- CS article "How blockchain could change the hotel industry"

Credits project's uniquiness is not only type of consensus, but also autonomous smart contracts, p2p, revolutionary high transaction speed and low fees. And also a very secure platform

I don't think that it's about all cryptoprojects. There are projects that have unique and very strong security platform. One of them is CREDITS. They have ansver to every attack that exist today, and it's thanks to technologies that they use such as  BLAKE2s hashing algorithm, Homomorphic encryption, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Improving the compression function, Reduction in the number of constants
