Look, I can only speak for myself here. I'm new to the whole bitcoin thing and think it's very interesting. The  idea is pretty exciting, it undermines century old power structures, etc.
But some users here - and you seem to be one of them - make me skeptical. Why are you so angry? Some of you guys have a striking resemblance to aggressive religious people. You shouldn't care if somebody criticizes bitcoin, **especially** when they have no idea of what they're talking about.


This just reminds me of all the other fanatics who want to the humiliated faces of others when a) the world revolution comes b) rapture comes c) the government comes to your house to take your guns away d) nuclear war ensures and you don't have a bunker ...
Again, bitcoin is awesome. Even if it fails, it paved the way for new currencies that are alike. And even if the world governments manage to  make bitcoin-like technology and currencies impossible, we all were part of an **exciting experiment**. If people think that the whole ordeal is idiotic and worthless, that's their goddamn right. It doesn't make me angry, I don't pity them, I just don't care. I shrug it off. 
**Edit: Oh god I just read the steam thread. Why are people so angry about something they dismiss?? I just don't get it. Why do they even care? Wow.**

... Did I just witness an actual, non-ironic *tips fedora* with a side of calling people *sir* online?
Wow. I thought it was just a legend.
