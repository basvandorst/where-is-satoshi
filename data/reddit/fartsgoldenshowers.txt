Thanks for the reply.  That verified my suspection.  I think the bottleneck on my system is CPU (and a bit of bandwidth because TOR).  I wonder where the bottleneck is on your PI if its not taking up that much CPU or bandwidth?  Do you have a fast connection?  Makes me wonder why people don't torrent the latest datafiles

Cool looking project.  How does it preserve privacy?

Sorry for the wall of text, but it wouldn't let me send you a PM.
Hi There,
Love yours tailsjoin distro.  The lite client works like a charm, but I don't like coinbase being able to possibly cluster my coins together using their API or seeing they're being used over TOR, so I want to use the full version.  I've got everything installed just fine (including bitcoin 0.11) but it's taking FOREVER to sync the blockchain.  I'm on a 10MB+ connection and can get 300KB+ over TOR on many occasions so I don't think its a bandwidth issue. Am I getting banned from other bitcoin clients because I'm using TOR or have a high ping rate?  Is my computer just trying to validate all the transactions and not even trying to request information from peers?  It's been running for 3+ days straight now and I still have 1 year and 15 months to sync (it was at 1 year 30 weeks 24 hours ago).  The update counter on qt is only about a quarter of the way across.  (Ie. at this rate at would take at least 2-3 weeks to finish) 
I pulled up top on the command line and see bitcoin-qt is using between 80-175% of my CPU so I've been thinking my PC is just trying to validate transactions.  But don't people run these on low power raspberry pis?  I'm guessing people arn't waiting 3 weeks for the blockchain to sync.  I looked into downloading the torrent, but apparently people don't do that anymore 'cause core fixed the distribution problem a versions ago.
Any idea how I can speed this process up a bit?

thank you for the reply.  I'll be sure to read that paper.
