I feel claustrophobic just watching that.
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:04:42
Sorry for your loss.
99% of the time I would type in the url field, but some times out of tiredness, laziness etc I would just search Google.
I don't keep BTC in blockchain.info though. I use it just as a block explorer.
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:52:23
I agree, bits sounds much more normal.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:00:08
... Then they join you.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:25:49
My sentiments precisely.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:40:05
I am going to bet No.
Then if ETF does not get approved I win. And if it does get approved I also win :)
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:26:51
Good riddance.

Bitcoindark is ending, but you can swap it for Komodo (KMD).
KMD will be in the top 10 sooner or later.

What pools do support SegWit and have upgraded?
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:08:17
Well said.
Although I hope we don't lose too much momentum, or people will look for alternatives.
@_date: 2017-01-26 07:48:01
Great summary. SegWit FTW!
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:55:55
Well said. Could not agree with you more. 
All the snarky responses like, "Pay more fees or don't let the door hit you on the way out, there is no problem", are astonishing.
I had not one doubt bitcoin would become mainstream one day. I had not anticipated the reluctance that would be met in trying to fix basic problems though.
We need Segwit now!

Xapo offers the best bitcoin card in my opinion. Not sure if they service Netherlands though.
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:39:28
Great news. I look forward to testing it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:43:08
It is hard not to agree with you.
We are having to deal with many support requests from newbies assuming our service is broken because deposits are not getting confirmed.
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:10:48
BTC will hit US$2000 within 60 days of activating segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:53:04
Lets just get to $5000 first..
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:18:44
I think 99% of the people FOMOing and driving up XRP prices don't know what they are actually buying. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:18:10
Funny because it's true.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:01:43
Not with the core wallet you dont, unless is has changed recently. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:58:24
Just keep your seed somewhere safe in the US.
If they seize the wallet on the way in get a new one and enter the seed and you are good to go.
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:47:32
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:56:59
No need to worry.
It will either get there or it wont (in which case you can spend it again), bitcoin does not just disappear.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:05:30
Sounds good!
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:38:36
Yes, our service would only support BIP148 if it is in the core code.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:30:48
Don't worry it will back up soon... We are still at the beginning.
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:03:41
Still well worth it!!

How is the US Air Force going to help?
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:43:33
Yeah, getting bad. Lots of customer complaints and outgoing txs starting to fail with "too-long-mempool-chain" error.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:19:10
How does this version differ from core? Quite hesitant to update a node (that has funds on it) with some randomly linked source.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:23:43
Yes, our service will only support BIP148 if its an option in core.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:31:14
Fuck ViaBTC!
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:09:17
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:42:17
"Do you own any bitcoin?".
Problem solved. How would they ever know?
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:42:29
Haha you got me... 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:40:44
Awesome! Cannot wait to start using lightning networks.... 
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:42:56
Again?
