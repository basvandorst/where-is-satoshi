What could be the repercussions?
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:37:31
pretty warm my friend

Well, those types of ATMs are scattered massively right now so they have low surveillance to ATM ratio. The Kiosk that we are bringing to Toronto is going to be watched by a person and camera 24/7 and will be maintained and opened up regularly and inspected.
From the Robocoin website (Our first Kiosk)

Well I think I am super late to this party, but my bitcoin company sponsors a Toronto dota 2 community. Although we don't have a big budget, we sponsor what we can in bitcoin just to help spread the word. The response with the dota community that I am in contact with is pretty positive. I notice that they don't fully understand bitcoin just yet, but they seem to be open to the idea. Some of the members ask questions about bitcoin and some try to answer but ultimately we clarify things when something comes up. Our company thinks targeting gamers is a good idea as they are already pretty tech savvy and will adjust quickly when learning about bitcoins.  We are glad to see that the bitcoin community is stepping into this area as it is not just only us now doing it. As for the games we ultimately cant tell you which ones to sponsor but we can give advice. Diversifying yourself in more than one area is the best chance that you will start a forest fire. Start lots of fires in lots of promising places

I know [BTC-E]( is an exchange where you can trade back and forth in different coins and also [VaultOfSatoshi]( can trade with many different coins to.

Keep on spreading the bitcoin love!

Remember that you are talking about a small minority of the occupy movement. It is global. Many occupy rallies, most likely the majority, had anarchistic ideals at the core. Occupy in oakland were totally different than lets say New York.  In america it may have a different context as the canadian, egyptian, hong kong, etc etc rallies. I remember in toronto it had a major anti-state vibe.

Hey! Thats great you want to pay it forward as thats what the community is about :D the only reason why it seems doge is low is cause btc is going up. Don't worry, as soon as bitcoin hits the moon, doge will take a giant leap for mankind.
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:45:58
Is this a date?

I wonder if BFL knows it has a bad rep.

Really enjoyed the animation very easy for anyone to digest. We will be sharing this.

Hey Jmichek, glad you want to help bitcoin prosper, that is great to hear and takes a big drive and ambition. Where in Canada are you about? I know in Toronto there are meetups around the city you can go to for more advice in person. 
One thing to know is it takes more funding than the initial investment, also banks are really slow as they are being really careful with bitcoin company. We are bringing our own ATM to Toronto really soon so just feel free to ask me anything more specific.

Yup! Bitcoin is very manual right now, it will turn into simple buttons just like how computers use to be run on DOS and now that runs in the background.

I said to Cortana "convert 1 bitcoin to Canadian dollars" it then showed it to me and said it outloud. I believe this is because Bing search views bitcoin as a currency. Awesome.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:35:43
Hi paddy_mack,
wanted to know if you would like to advertise on our website for free. We are bringing in services and stores that are accepting bitcoin within and around Toronto. =)

Exactly, Doge started off as a meme so...take it as serious as memes are. But as words of encouragement, TOO THE MOON!

**Why Bitcoin** took some points from [bitconnect](














I don't want to assume I will be getting any coin so if you don't mind PMing me for the address :)
I made bold to the words that you can read and understand what the whole point is referring to. Trying to explain that bitcoin is more than its currency but it is also a technology.

Shutting Silk Road down introduced the public to bitcoin.

What selling points does your sales team provide to the merchants that sway them over to accept bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:48:03
Our ATM will be shipping out this week and we should have it in Toronto next week.
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:24:20
Hi Operators,
We believe that bitcoin adoption will be propagated by its ease of access. Bitcoin ATMs and vending machines stand at the forefront of spreading the accessibility of cryptocurrency. With quick and easy services to acquire bitcoins, it will be much easier to educate the general population on the advantages of using bitcoins (remittance, merchant solutions, etc.)
As operators of bitcoin dispensing machines, we should band together to make a network that is easy for people to access bitcoin. Promotion of both of our businesses can be done if you are willing to help us by answering a quick survey. We want to provide reliable and factual statistics from bitcoin ATMs and vending machines to show that it is more beneficial than traditional methods of moving money. 
Send us a PM if you want to do the survey we have.
We appreciate the cooperation.
We messaged a lot of bitcoin ATM/vending machine/kiosk operators but unfortunately there wasn't a big response to the survey.  Only 8 responded to the survey.
Here are the current results of a survey we put together: 
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:27:20
Is it today or tomorrow? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:51:28
Cant wait to work with your team at VoS. We are based in Toronto, ill drop by for a visit sometime soon 😊
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:38:16
that's a pretty good guess!
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:29:47
So these ATM-like machines are there for convenience for people who want to get their feet wet into bitcoin but are not sure if they want to connect their bank account to an exchange. So the fee's from these machines are there for convenience, they may feel high right now but once more machines start to come out, it will create competition and it will bring them down. They always show up in the news because its a new innovation and revolutionary technology and bitcoin is a good buzz word right now.
But you put your money in and you can send bitcoin right into your wallet or you can scan your wallet and get money out instantly. So you want to buy something in bitcoin right now, go to an ATM and buy and transfer it with out worrying about volatility. Or you can buy it online, meet up with someone or go to an exchange and miss out on the price you wanted to buy at. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:52:52
Any reviews on this?
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:13:41
If my comment doesn't get buried send me your wallet address ill send you some bitcoin. =D
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:40:11
 but there are a lot of places in Toronto that are accepting  it, theres around 30 but here are [a list of 20ish](

What are the other ATM machines? Are they all Robocoin? We're bringing in a Kiosk in Toronto so how do you feel about the ATMs compared to the exchanges?
@_date: 2014-04-23 06:51:58
Check out this [easy read]( explaining what is bitcoin and also has a FAQ at the bottom.

Didn't make it through :\ the t.v was just on in the background and the glimpse caught my time.
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:37:02

Not sure I will check out some other places.

[NomNomNom]( it was really good, fell asleep good right after.
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:30:20
 yea there is going to be a wave of ATMs coming to Toronto.  Were actually bringing a robocoin =)
@_date: 2014-04-29 05:31:32
Yup, all these exchanges and escrows need some sort of verification system which takes a while, Bitcoin is still new which is why ATM-like machines are big and very convenient. I'm actually going to be bringing one in a few weeks but it only accepts Canadian dollars for now.
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:04:23
This is really big news for hip-hop fans, charity fans, and adoption fans.  Nas just keeps being a cooler guy in my books. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 05:08:31
That was my mistake, I thought that said litecoin instead of linden dollars. Have you checked [Local Bitcoin?](
