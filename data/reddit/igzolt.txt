woops! excuse me while i get my reading glasses....
@_date: 2016-08-19 20:37:48
LibertyX.com you can buy as little as $1 within minutes if you are near one of their stores.

does anyone have a compilation of all of the swift losses?

i did not get the email. can you paste the contents?
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:37:18
yeah but with distressed you typically get 15-30 cents on the dollar. now it is still at 80-85. hopefully it doesn't get there....

very nice. how do you let lower case letters though?
@_date: 2014-12-06 06:10:08
the BTM experience is great. the fees just need to come down. can't wait till more pop up. any more planned for chicago? between this and libertyx.com stores (looks like 10+ locations) it is becoming super easy to buy bitcoin with cash.
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:09:35
i received 0.285 BTC earlier this morning around 10a. yeah. it said the exchange rate was not locked in until the PIN was redeemed. there was a live ticker on the site. the few times i've looked at it the price was almost always within 20 cents of bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:37:08
I tweeted to the CEO asking for clarification around buying. He said they are still updating the language around the exchange, but if you were interested to fill out the contact form indicating as such. 
It looks like you can buy BTC (&gt;25 BTC) separate from the investment trust (BIT) which is the one that requires the accredited investor status. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:47:07
i used libertyX.com and went to a TMobile store kiosk in the Prudential mall. the exchange rate was $350 when i redeemed. basically same as Bitstamp. tried to take screenshots of the whole process. i already redeemed the PIN before taking the second photo.
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:43:27
check out libertyx.com. they launched recently and have a bunch of store locations nationwide. in-person like localbitcoins but better pricing and you get to use your own wallet (as much security as you want). you do have to provide basic ID information to redeem the PIN (driver's license). 
there is a detailed thread about them here: 
@_date: 2014-11-22 04:09:41
have all MIT students now gotten their bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:11:06
is being &lt; 18 an issue?
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:29:40
any plans to incorporate this on a local scale? i think this would be incredibly convincing for local small/medium businesses. it would allow bitcoin enthusiasts to go in person to sign up merchants armed with this data (you are missing out on $x sales and saving 3% of all credit card transactions)
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:28:23
unfortunately i didn't. it's almost too quick to record. if you have your QR code ready to go the only step that takes time is inserting the bills.
i just 1) scanned my QR code 2) inserted bills 3) clicked send
they also had some directions printed on the machine, but i didn't bother reading them.

anyone know their bank? or connected their bank account? they don't support mine...
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:07:08
will def go check it out!
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:47:11
any idea what % of students who applied for it received it already?
@_date: 2017-02-02 04:13:28
...and it's down to only 5% down for the day
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:58:20
nice...except for the price tag. $30! i'm not a hat guy but i think that's on the high side?
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:12:42
actually i think i've made almost $1 :) the price isn't locked in until you redeem the PIN so it's nice to have that flexibility. i didn't redeem until i was home.
@_date: 2017-02-01 20:05:57
what were the fees? sounds a lot like LibertyX which i have been using for my bitcoin purchases.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:48:08
who did you use for your wallet provider? any idea on breakdown?
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:42:31
but where was his hat made?
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:47:01
bad timing since biteasy is closing down operations? 
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:00:49
this seems like a credit card version of libertyx.com. you pay much higher fees for using your credit card. with libertyx you have to pay in cash. when i compared pricing it was 390 trucoin vs 375 at libertyx.
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:26:44
if you are looking to donate them, i'll take one and cover shipping :)
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:05:25
any chance you can share the contact info? very interested in getting a similar costume.
@_date: 2017-02-01 20:06:49
how long does it take to go from testnet to public release?
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:17:44
$1K/day for me. never had a problem with their Preferred stores.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:01:40
check out LibertyX (libertyx.com/buy-bitcoin) to buy bitcoin with cash at a retail store near you. you would have to buy $50 or $100 increments but 1% fees instead of 5-10% using LBC.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:51:50
libertyx if there is a store near you. cash only but it is instant.
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:59:10
do they use the same FX price for buy/sell?
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:13:22
libertyx if they have a location near you. low fees and literally you can have it in minutes.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:08:19

@_date: 2017-03-15 13:54:00
someday they will make a movie about all this and it will be glorious
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:08:04
jeez, no libertyx stores nearby? i'm sure you could find someone with a retail store to signup as a libertyx store and charge less than that. that fee is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:56:49
libertyx if you use cash and are near one of their stores
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:50:38
if you have own/operate a retail store, sell bitcoin using libertyx.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:46:33
nice. they are integrated with libertyx for their cash locations.
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:25:07
its not anonymous nor will any bitcoin company that provides fiat-to-bitcoin in the long run. they require the same info that coinbase or circle ask for.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:53:27
that's why i use libertyx. i have to take out cash to buy at stores, but it is instant but at least there are no hidden/unexpected fees. 
worst part of the cb change is is that the average joe won't even be able to predict the fee amount since it is based on inputs.
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:57:04
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:57:09
I just checked and see a bunch around SF, if you mean SF Bay. They have a lot near me in NYC. Seems like they are ramping up the store upgrades finally.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:41:21
breadwallet for storing bitcoin. 
libertyx for buying it.
@_date: 2017-01-19 02:13:43
Libertyx.com or their app but cash only 
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:33:10
I think this might just be the first time when someone says 100K locations in the crypto space and it actually happens! Very excited to see this in the wild.
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:39:21
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:38:15
check out a libertyx store (libertyx.com). usually around 5%
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:29:27
badum bum chaaa!
@_date: 2017-01-31 01:49:55
they offer $100 bonus if you refer a store that signs up libertyx.com/refer-store 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:33:32
libertyx. cash at local stores and instant settlement. you will have bitcoin before you leave the store.
@_date: 2016-11-11 01:36:29
buy with cash at a local retail store from libertyx.com or their app
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:49:06
LibertyX.com for buying at a retail store near you
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:01:39
logo has been roger ver-ified!
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:57:23
if there is a libertyx store near you, they almost are always cheaper than btms
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:04:56
Yes LibertyX/breadwallet best combo and now in-app
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:53:31
Hmm. Try one with a photo in the LibertyX listing? Google maps is often outdated especially with local stores since they have a lot of turnover
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:01:00
libertyx is 1K/day but it is cash only.
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:19:12
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:47:34
use your own wallet (breadwallet on iOS, mycellium on Android) and LibertyX.com mobile app/website to buy the bitcoin. you will never have this problem again!
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:47:47
yeah. it's my go to for cash2btc now. no fees for first 1K and there is one 3 blocks away from me! OP, state are you in?
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:45:31
to the moon and back (and again)
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:47:58
you are everywhere these days!
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:48:37
When did you use their service? I remember this was an issue a few years back when they had a bunch of stores through a processor partner but I haven’t had an issue lately. They also have integrated with regular ATMs in the Boston area so you might have more success with that?
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:00:13
is this an all time record?
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:05:39
free for the first 1K if you use FB login. otherwise 1% (i haven't spent that much yet) supposedly.
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:45:06
+2. I've been 4 for 4 with LibertyX @ the new Ace Cash stores. It's a way better experience. Highly recommend if you have one near you. Check their store locator out.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:55:25
LibertyX - pay cash at store near you
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:05:31
OP, where in NY? the city? i was there a few days ago and there were a bunch of libertyx stores downtown.
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:26:44
Libertyx store if you have one near you. Similar fee and you get the bitcoin instantly 
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:46:57
check out libertyx. they charge 8% but no funny business with the FX rate. they have traditional atm's (where you can use debit card) in addition to cashiers. depending on where you are in SF, could make sense. otherwise, btm's may be the only option.
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:44:56
where are you located?
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:49:48
What city is this? I'm a big LibertyX fan but have never seen this sticker before. As long as you visit their red marker "preferred" stores on their store locator I've never had a bad experience. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 17:16:54
i would definitely add libertyx. it's what i recommend to most newbies. they also have a link to breadwallet in their app which makes it easy for someone completely new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:29:00
perfect lead-in to thursday night football
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:23:35
depending on what country you are in, check out libertyx.com (US only) - they offer exactly this.
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:55:45
It was better than ME/vista/7!
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:23:12
+1. can't beat the convenience of a local store near you.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:50:04
my thoughts exactly
@_date: 2016-09-06 23:08:16
which BTM manufacturer is that? doesn't look like anything i've seen before.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:32:04
they use libertyx to sell bitcoin here. been around for a few months at least afaik
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:44:54
easy to check if someone makes a buy and looks at the address. i'm assuming they don't change sending addresses. depends on the machine i suppose.

LibertyX should be under ATMs - they have 13K cash-to-bitcoin stores
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:44:25
is that graphic for real? mspaint is NEVER the answer!
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:25:13
it seems to vary. i buy there and coinbase and i'd say 90% of the time libertyx is cheaper and i don't have to wait the 3-4 days which has been rough with price swings over the last month.
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:00:08
Just searched the store locator libertyx.com/locations and looks like lucky Duke Blue Devils have a bunch of bitcoin stores near them. Didn't a Duke student hold up a QR code at a football game or something?

Twilight merch pweez.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:11:50
People buy from ATMs also for speed. Coinbase takes 7+ days for ACH to clear and funds to be taken off. BTMs are usually instant. Services like LibertyX even better since they let you select the transaction fee so you won’t get stuck during mempool full periods.
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:01:29

i got my hands on a copy. i've uploaded it here: 
@_date: 2013-07-10 20:25:06
should show up after 3-5. what are you using for your wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:22:11
true, might have a further muted impact in addition to the lag since processors like bitpay allow for conversion of some fixed % (the rest remaining in BTC) of the transaction value to the currency (USD in this example).
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:52:28
i would argue if you anticipate increased purchasing demand on friday, buy today (or yesterday ideally...)! the 1% transaction fee is peanuts to any price movement in BTC!
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:29:24
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:02:56
the only exchange that is significantly higher than coinbase is mt. gox and you cannot get USD out there for all intents and purposes. coinbase purportedly uses bistamp for their purchases so it essentially trades in line with them. localbitcoins you could sell for significantly higher than CB/BTS but it's not a real-time mktplace and is much more manual labor.

similar to the wedbush report, i am trying to get the actual PDF. until then, here is essentially a copy-paste of the research report:
