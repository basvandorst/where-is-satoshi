So.. just wait until the other side gives in?

I'd sign up in a second. I've been trying to think of a good name for such a sub.  Something like r/bitcoinall or r/bitcoinx

Hey thank you for this! I'd never heard about the accelerator and it totally work for a transaction of mine that's been stuck for over 24 hours!

On this sub, you get banned if you try to promote unlimited, on the other side you just get voted down to hell if you try to promote core/segwit (because they are all banned from here and stupid angry about it)

might have something to worry about.. Coinbase certainly doesn't support core and they are the biggest player in the field as far as I can see

How do you propose we break the political stalemate, given that neither side appears willing to give in?

Segwit is not a compromise, to compromise you'd have to give up something.  What does core give up with segwit?
@_date: 2017-01-31 15:19:50
ok, you keep telling yourself that while we all sit here watching other cryptos use segwit instead of us
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:21:03
You mean bitcoin stagnates while the rest of the crypto currency world chugs onward, right?

More transactions =/= bigger blocks.
What's so bad about a 2mb hardfork?  Why hasn't core put forward an olive branch?

I agree.  We're in a political deadlock. How can we move forward if nobody will compromise?
