What happens in theory is that any percentage tax or fee like this is split between the merchant and customer depending on how elastic demand is for the type of goods the merchant sells.

It would be better to use bitcoin because they don't control the miners and therefore cannot manipulate the blockchain.

A lot of people will still buy things because having them now is worth more to them than what they gain by waiting. Also there are still purchases you can't defer. Unless we see a massive deflation rate I doubt that we'll see huge changes in spending.

I believe the plan is to try and make one share = ~1GH/s. Also instead of reinvesting a percentage of the earnings share holders will be able to choose to reinvest by buying more shares. I assume that this means that more shares will be created when new hardware is brought online. That way one share will still equal ~1GH/s.

Technically that's your precision, not your accuracy. Your accuracy is how close to your target your darts hit. Precision is how close together the darts hit.

The problem is the average person doesn't care about it due to ignorance. They don't really understand what is possible with widespread high-speed low latency Internet. There are likely many things that the average person would be interested in but is unaware of because our current infrastructure does not support it.
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:44:10
As Internet connection speeds increase more applications that require high bandwidth connections with become possible. Without the infrastructure it isn't possible for business to develop services that rely on it.

Yeah but, 95^25 is hard to remember while 10,000^4 isn't. You could probably remember 5 or 6 words fairly easily.

Nope, they probably sold futures tokens. They're a speculative token so people can trade S2X even though the fork hasn't happened yet. So it's whoever bought those tokens that is left holding the bag since they won't get their S2X coins unless the fork happens later.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:56:21
Presumably some people think that they're likely to try again.

You have to use a sufficiently large dictionary. Instead of having 62 alphanumeric characters or 95 printable ASCII characters possible characters in your password you have around 10,000 words if not more. 
10,000^n vs 95^n allows for the same strength with a smaller n which means there is less information to remember. 
Note: The words should be selected at random, with dice or some other random method.

That username is for the JSON-RPC server you can enable, the reason GUIMiner asks for it is so it can connect to your client for solo mining so you probably don't need to worry about it.
Bitcoin itself doesn't use a username or password it instead uses private keys which are stored in your wallet.dat (C:\Users\&lt;name&gt;\AppData\roaming\bitcoin\wallet.dat assuming Vista/7) file which you should enable encryption on and back it up to a safe place.  If you lose your wallet.dat file you lose any coins you had in your wallet so make sure you have a backup.

You do however need to see how it will break before you try to fix it.  In some ways we can already see some issues which will need to be address before they become an issue.
@_date: 2012-01-16 07:55:56
No problem.
@_date: 2012-01-21 11:07:06
The wallet.dat file contains the private key that is used to sign your transactions.  Basically if you had 1BTC in your wallet and you backed up your wallet.dat, sent 0.5BTC to a friend and then lost your wallet.dat to a hard drive failure when you restore your wallet.dat you will still have 0.5BTC.  A newly installed Bitcoin client won't show this right away as it will need to download the blockchain first.
It isn't so much as the bitcoin's code being in the wallet but more like the bitcoins being assigned to the wallet's public key.
I hope that all makes sense I was trying not to get too technical.
@_date: 2011-10-20 19:18:57
Something similar to bitcoin could be created that backs the currency with computing power.  Every coin is worth X amount of computing power.  One issue I can see is it would be fairly complicated to make it decentralized and to actually get the network started as the network needs to be secured like bitcoin but also needs to do work. 
Unfortunately you can't really secure it using the work as it will usually be hard to verify.  Also since the idea is that anyone can either use the currency like money or exchange it for X computing power.  
Coins being used as money are processed like bitcoins are now where as coins redeemed are handled similar to how bitcoin transaction fees are processed, except they are paid out in smaller blocks.
One possibly fatal flaw in such a system is that the cost of x computing power will only ever decrease meaning the currency can only ever become less valuable, unless someone can figure out some method of preventing this any system backed this way will likely fail.
@_date: 2011-10-20 20:09:13
To answer question  you don't.  Any method that would prevent illegitimate uses of the system would either require a centralized system or simply allowing anyone to see the processing being done on their system.  The first option goes against the whole concept of bitcoin and the second option poses concerns over the security of the data and code being run by the network.

A lot of the SI units are based on physical constants or combinations of units that are. Even then some of those definitions contain arbitrary numbers.

Yeah this virus is a bit more sophisticated than what I had initially assumed, I've read *your* post and it seems that without a backup there isn't really much you can do once it's run. Well besides pay of course.

The latency might cause issues, the worst case round trip delay is over 20 minutes. An altcoin with less frequent blocks might be better.

I'm not saying you should leave, I'm merely pointing out that the option exists. As you seem to like your current home, are any of the things that you like about it funded by taxes?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:03:02
Rational move.
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:54:53
How so?

It's a very solid start.

What method of funding would you suggest for a school in a poor neighbourhood where the residents can't afford to fund the school themselves?
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:54:58
You could leave, there are other countries with little to no taxation, maybe you would be happier living in one of them.

I hadn't considered asymmetric encryption but based on what has found it seems that it does use some asymmetric encryption so a RAM dump probably won't help.

If you think it's going to go up then invest now, you might have missed one opportunity but who knows? Don't invest more than you can afford to lose but any amount of coins could still make you some money.

The idea is each item has a different code so you order by scanning it. An even better system would be to have a tablet at the table that generates table specific addresses for each item or group of items and orders it when you pay.

It targets businesses so it's possible that the person who tries to fix it isn't the same people that causes the problem. With that said based on what has found a RAM dump probably won't help.

Not quite, the chance of losing the tenth time is the same as losing the first time. The chance of losing ten times in a row is the chance of losing to the power of ten. The gambler's fallacy is believing that past losses make a future win more likely. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:42:35
It isn't possible to choose your address but you can use a program called vanitygen to continuously make new addresses and try to find one that starts with the string you want. (The address will be 1&lt;your string&gt;restofaddress like the one from the sign.) Address creation is deterministic but it isn't possible to predict so it can take a very long time to find your address if your string is long. The address from the sign only has a five character non-case-sensitive string so it probably didn't take very long to find.

I'd find it unlikely that such a virus would manage to encrypt quite that much data before somebody noticed so a 12 hour full restore is probably less than likely. Also if the virus is currently encrypting files a RAM dump will probably contain the encryption key so the more data it encrypts the more likely you'll be able to bypass it. Even if the company decides to just pay the ransom there is no guarentee that the virus will decrypt the data so attempting a RAM dump or planning a restore is probably a good idea anyways.
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:18:21
The victim communicates by paying, the criminal can see the payment on the blockchain and has a server send the key to decrypt the files.

If you connect to every single Bitcoin node and monitor the transactions they send you you could in theory determine which machine sent the transaction based on the order the nodes send you the transaction. It isn't perfect but you could manage to determine a rough location on the origin, this is easily fooled by proxies though but by itself Bitcoin isn't entirely anonymous.  
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:53:27
They definitely need to automate the whole process before I can see it actually being used for anything more than the novelty.
