If by "withdrawing" you mean selling BTC for USD and leaving as USD, then no. When you sell the BTC for more than you paid for it, you owe tax on your gain. 
For example, imagine I buy 1.0 BTC at 10,000 USD/BTC then sell .5 BTC at 20,000 USD/BTC. I would realize a gain of $5,000 - my transaction costs, and owe taxes on that amount (which would depend on my income level and how long I've held the bitcoin.) I would not owe taxes on the remaining .5 BTC unless and until I sell it or spend it.

That's complicated, and there's no definite answer right now. 
For stocks, you have the option of using first-in first-out accounting (FIFO) or specific identification. p.42-43 [IRS PUB 550]( So if I own 100 shares of Ford and want to sell one, the default rule is that I am selling my oldest share. Alternatively, I can tell my broker to sell a specific share (say the 17th share I bought because I bought it at the highest price). 
The IRS has said that bitcoin is to be treated as property. People have assumed that it is a "capital asset" p. 22 of [IRS Pub 544]( which is likely to be true, but may not be in all cases (the IRS guidance on cryptocurrencies specifically says bitcoin may not be a capital asset in all cases). The basis for property is the price you paid for it. 
Let's say you bought 1.0 BTC on 1/1/17 for $1,000 and 1.0 BTC on 12/1/17 for $10,000, using coinbase for both. You then sell 1.0 BTC on 12/31/17 for $20,000. When you're filling out your form 8949, you describe the property you bought, the date you bought and sold and your proceeds and basis. That might look like this:  
    (a)   1.0 BTC     (b)    12/1/17      (c)  12/31/17  (d)   $20,000   (e) $10,000     
 
So you'd have a $10,000 short term capital gain rather than a $19,000 short term capital gain. 
Here's the problem:
If the IRS audits you, they could require you to specifically identify the bitcoin you sold. If you used your own wallet and didn't commingle the two purchases, that's straightforward. You can show the IRS evidence that the bitcoin you sold was the one you bought on 12/1. But if you left the funds on coinbase or just used one wallet, there's no way to identify what you sold. What's worse, [coinbase's internal accounting]( will show you sold the one you bought on 1/1. 
tl;dr - you would just report the sale of the bitcoin bought at 10k and not report the sale of the bitcoin bought at 4k until you sell that one. This could cause problems.

Okay, let's do an example with stocks: Imagine this is my trading history:
[Ignoring commissions]  
1/1/16 - Deposit $1000 to my brokerage account  
1/1/16 - Buy 100 $F   
1/2/17 - Sell 80 $F @ 12.5/share  
1/2/17 - Withdraw $1000 from my brokerage account  
I "realize" a "capital gain" on the sale of stock, not the withdrawal. My taxable gain is the proceeds of the sale ($1000) - the basis ($800). My broker sends me a 1099-b. I report this on [Schedule D of Form 1040]( and [Form 8949]( I do not pay any tax on the remaining 20 shares of Ford stock I still own. When I do sell it, the basis on those shares will remain the same - $10/share. 
Bitcoin is different because you won't get a 1099(b) and there are different rules between it and stocks (e.g. it's unclear how "wash sales" work with bitcoin). 
1) According to the [IRS]( you will have to pay income taxes on any gains from any BTC you convert into USD, goods or services.   
2) You will report it exactly like a stock sale, except you will not receive a 1099(b).  
3) You are legally required to report it. Coinbase recently [was ordered]( to hand over data to the IRS.  
4) The reporting process is just filing a tax return.*  
5) If you file your own taxes with capital gains income already, adding bitcoin adds very little complexity.
*Note: If you use a foreign exchange and have the equivalent of $10,000 US there, you may be required to file an [FBAR]( regardless of whether you have sold anything in that tax year.

To an extent, assuming the desire to hold equates to the desire to buy regardless of what the market does. The problem comes if everyone holding is doing simply to resell for a profit at some future time and no one is buying them for anything else.
