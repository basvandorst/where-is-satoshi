Was thinking about this watching the big short last night. You know one of the main thing that makes a bubble is that very few people realize its a bubble. This is why the more i hear btc is a bubble, the more confident i am its not

The best way would be to not sell. Hodl everything you have. We are just getting started
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:37:03
It usually takes around 4-5 days for bank verification and then another day or 2 to go into your coinbase account

This is awesome. Nobody deserves it more and i think it proves our commitment to community

At your age it is well worth the risk. Start doing a dollar cost average every week. This will cut down on volatility. It allows you get in now in case the price continues to rise but also gives you opportunity to accumulate more btc when the market does have a dip

I couldn't agree more. I just don't think we are at the bubble yet. It seems "too obvious". I think futures will come in boosting the price even more at first. There is really not enough sell side to out weigh the buy right now. Once the futures boost the price and everything is looking great I think we will get that corrections everybody has been expecting since around 4k. It could honestly get really scary for hodlers. Like a possible 60% corrections. Nerves could be tested. But this is obviously all speculation. Would love to hear your opinion about this and I appreciate the educated input to my first comment

This seems like a win win

I find it wonderfully ironic that their tactic of inflating money will eventually be the reason we get away from fiat all together

Thank you

If it is to confusing still after reading the getting started the easiest way for you to understand might be to watch some youtube videos and follow along. BTW the wallet is a much more secure way of hodling btc and thus the reason it is smart to keep your btc stored there. Think of it as your own person bank. If something happens to the exchange and your coins are on there you might be out of luck. If its in your wallet you don't have to worry about that. Good luck. Hope this helps. Welcome to the BTC community

My pleasure 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:30:30
Lol hodl=hold 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:14:32
If you are not worried then definitely jump in. Well worth it. Especially at 16. Just hodl and you will be just fine

I would not tell her untill you are ready to get out. I dont think she will understand keeping it in btc when it is worth that much usd. Most people cannot fathom not taking millions of dollars for hundreds of btc. If you are planning on keeping that invested i would not bring it to her attention. I think this will start an argument more than make her happy. Good luck. And nice buy in 2012

As of now
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:58:37
Yes. They sent out an email informing everyone that they would automatically get the equivalent amout of bitcoin2x if your BTC is on coinbase. No action is required 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:03:00
Email was sent saying funds need to be in account 24 hrs before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:23:47
The point is to never sell. If BTC is successful, when BTC is successful you wont want to trade it for USD/EUR
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:43:55
Close it
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:06:18
Buy weekly
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:20:59
If you use bank wire before 1 p.m pst it will get there the same day. If after 1 p.m it will get there the following day
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:31:19
These post worry me that people are really missing the big picture
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:56:29
Its usually smart to keep some type of cash to buy the dips. If possible buy on a weekly basis. This will allow you to make money on the bull run and buy more in a bear market
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:58:17
How bad do you need your car? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:39:22
People have asked this question at 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k, 7k, you get the point. Just buy and dont try to time the market. Buy some btc and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:00:19
Fork date is Nov 16th. Funds need to be in account 24 hrs before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:56:14
Especially since we dont even use the gold standard anymore
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:25:43
As fast as you can
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:26:45
Trying to time the market is very risky. The next dip might be 20k-17k. There is really no way to know. Just buy and hodl
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:27:42
If by scared you mean scared of having to hodl through all time highs then still no. To the moon
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:36:32
What about buying something like $100 worth a week. This will allow you cut down the volatility. You can profit in a bull run and buy in cheap in a bear market
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:20:39
Thank you
