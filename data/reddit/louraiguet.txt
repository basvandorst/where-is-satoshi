I understand we need a value to speak about, but IMO the only price that matters is one of the website you use.
If I use Bitstamp for my deposits/withdrawal, why should I take into account the price at Mt.Gox ?
EDIT: In a more practical point of view, the price of Bitcoin is very artificial. I think the value of Bitcoin depends on those two questions :
-how reliable is the protocol ?
-what are the shops you can spend your money at ? (coinmap) the more options we have to spend BTC, the highest its value is. But there is no absolute answer on those questions (especially the second one).

Who said Satoshi is a genius ? Maybe it's a whole team of developers, economists and whatnot.
Also, if they are specialized in their field, they may offer a more serious point of view than the average bitcoin owner's one.

this document is full of clichés. Is Sarah Palin the author ?
For educational purpose it's always better to be neutral.

There is no chance factor at that level of complexity.

Would you mind elaborate on this? I don't really know about Starbucks.

It would be nice to have some more accurate charts (e.g. bitcoinwisdom) taking into account the average value of selected places. Unfortunatly I'm not skilled to edit your code.

I'm into maths for a long time now and have never heard about it.
This is awesome. Thank you for sharing this.

Never said that. It's not perfect, as everything else mankind achieved, but so far it's the best we have.
It might be simple (I don't think so) but still, nobody did it before. And it's a billion dollar economy. So I don't think it's that simple.


Or maybe the people behind this name were humble enough to think that, maybe, later, there will be something wrong. So they made it doable to change/disable whatever causes problem without destroying all the network. It's a sign of humbleness or a long-time overall view. No luck.
