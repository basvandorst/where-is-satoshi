Scam customer support number for Bittrex 18336614666. I'm like 99.99&amp; sure it is.
I was having some difficulties with their verification system this morning when I was trying submitting my photos so I called this number after googling a support number for Bittrex. ! \+18336614666 \(Bittrex customer service \) " Since I didnt see a number on the site.. I was hoping to find a business number with support on a google search"
The guy on the other side of phone claims to be from the states " with an Indian/British accent" and he was very persistent on trying to allow him to remote access my computer.. I questioned him for about 5 minutes why the f do you need to access my computer if there is a problem with my photo verification process! My photos are already on your server why cant you access them your self?! He never gave a straight answer and at the end it seems the guy was getting kinda inpatient with me and he said my account was going to get removed and banned.. I told him to go f him self and etc..
Later on today.. I had a little flash back about YouTube video I was watching about people falling for a fake virus warning and were prompted to call a number. The YouTube poster called the number was also talking a operator with an Indian accent and wanted remote access to the callers computer..
" I would never allowed anyone to remote access my computer ever.. but anyone who is not aware of this scam..this needs to be posted ASAP"
"Try it out for your self.. make up some lie about having problems about some photos uploads or something"
Upvote to warn everyone please..
now.. I feel bad sending a nasty gram tweet to bittrex.. lol and my account got verified when I got back home today..
