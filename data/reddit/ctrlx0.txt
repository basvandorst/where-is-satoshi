I like to think of 1 Bitcoin as 1 BAR of gold. You can then split that bar up into as small as a little nugglet.

Use any 12v PSU that will push enough juice, but my money is that it's dead from all that oxidization. ICs may be fine but I would not trust those caps/chokes for power delivery so replace those if you plan on powering this thing on. On top of that even second-hand mining hardware is rarely going to be worth it unless you can buy the whole farm. Seems like someone wanted to make a buck off their trash. Good luck though.

Right, and he's talking about the situation where you don't sell it...
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:55:18
It is lame.

Sorry, but only clueless people call anything "cyber".

zCash is fine, they're just rooting for their team.

Can't even spell my name right.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:57:35
No you're not :P
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:59:00
Yeah probably.

I thought my widget was just glitching out then came here to check. Hmm.
Edit: It's doing it again!

What makes you think banks back every dollar?
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:58:34
In 2018 that's just "security".

Should be top comment.
Edit: Lol, so I get downvoted after it makes top comment.
