When you measure monetary supply do you measure in $5,000, 20,000 or $100,000,000 dollar units or in single dollars?  I’m glad my comment helped your IQ. You can use it. Scarcity of BTC is largely a farce.

2.1 quadrillion satoshis is not really as scarce as you might think.  I find it funny when people talk about scarcity when each bitcoin is divisible by 100 million units.

So, with this mindset and belief regarding bitcoin scarcity why would you ever encourage anyone to buy a fraction of a bitcoin?  The African who owns 0.005 bitcoin - will he measure this in the future by saying my account has 500,000 Satoshi or will he say I have 0.005 btc?  What is the whole “stacking sats” campaign about if the only thing that matters is whole bitcoins?  In fact from my own evangelism over the years the scarcity argument only works to motivate early buyers.  Get in now before you can’t afford a full one!!!  Theoretically, in the future even a millionaire will not be able to afford a full bitcoin - so how will you created motivated buyers (in btc aka greater fools) if the millionaire can’t own a full one?  You better hope it’s by selling them on the scarcity of a divisible unit(s) of btc, or at some point, the interest greatly wanes and with it- the price. 
Then there’s the fact that most can’t own a full one is depressing to many.  Most people don’t want to own only 0.2 or 0.09 of something  - so for your sake you better hope that the staking sats nonsense really takes off and becomes a household word.  And the final total unchangable units of this account? yup 2.1 quadrillion (minus what was lost) SATS. 
Lastly, bitcoin is under 8k after 11 years. Relatively speaking, no one cares about this scarcity you speak of. I used to be a big proponent of the scarcity argument but now that we have xmr, bch, xrp, nano etc etc — the “scarce btc” argument loses even exponentially more potency (thanks largely to small blocks btw).  There is 0 adoption of btc. It’s effectively maxed out. It’s now just a new experiment in SOV.  (Fingers crosses that the propaganda about the value of unspendable money works) Lightning network is utter garbage so spending my “sats” is still expensive and at times impossible. My money is therefore becoming unusable without using a middle man to first change it into something else which is.  What a delight!  ��‍♂️
Do I want to see btc fail?  No.  But is it failing do to the constraints put on it?  Yes it is, Badly.  Economic illiterates fail to recognize this.  But here, it is simply the proud and haughty status quo. Economic retardation is apparently a badge of honor.

Wow, talk about arguments that have been made hundreds of times before. Lol.  I’ve been in this game a lot longer than you. Trust me.  I understand the value propositions you suggest and believe in most of them.  This is exactly why I now buy Monero and Bitcoin Cash.  Network effect is real but it’s certainly not permanent - especially with the LN being such a Rube Goldberg machine that is a year away from completion in perpetuity.

the point is there are 2.1 QUADRILLION satoshis. It's not scarce and heavily concentrated in fewer hands now than even the dollar is!  If BTC becomes the world reserve currency and you own a whole one (or 21 as you say) then congratulations! But this is not going to happen, hate to break it to you. IF there is an actual winner in crypto it will not only be a SOV, it will be used as cash.
