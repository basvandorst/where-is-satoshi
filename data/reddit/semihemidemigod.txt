I treat bitcoin like a casino with really loose slots.

How would a brick-and-mortar place accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:33:34
I figured that. I was wondering the technical details. Do I print out a QR code for a wallet and post it?

Congrats! And don’t worry about cashing out, just take a portion of what was your mortgage payment and buy a little each month.

That's basically how banks started. Rich Venetian merchants started lending their gold at interest. But because Catholics couldn't lend with interest it became a predominantly Jewish industry. This is the origin of the character Shylock, and much of modern anti-semitism.

That's the point: They still have to do exchange rates in their head to know if they're paying the right amount. People have an innate feel for what a dollar is and what it buys. We need to get Bitcoin to the point where we know the value without comparing it to another "real" currency.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:37:46
I think the way to fix this would be to have a semi-large vendor take a chance on it and make it credits. If somewhere like Lyft started accepting and paying in Bitcoin it would nail down the actual value to something concrete. The problem is there needs to be some kind of advantage to them doing this, and I'm not familiar enough with their business to figure it out.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:41:53
Because we all know what we can get for a $1. And until we stop having to say "Okay, 0.002BTC is like $10" people won't use it everyday because people hate math.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:23:03
It's more concrete than comparing it to another fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:20:04
But how?
I prefer to think that Satoshi is an AI.
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:07:20
Divisibility is actually a weakness here, as people have a much harder time subtracting 0.000013 from 0.000325 than they do subtracting 13 from 325.
Improving the design to show satoshis instead of bitcoin would help, especially if we pick 1/1000 of a satoshi as the floor.
Is there a bitcoin wallet that shows the balance in satoshis?
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:57:02
No, I made about $500 last year. I put in $10 a pay and sold after it hit $17k the second time. I've only had a net loss since then, but even then it's not much total money, and if it spikes again I'll make a bit.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:11:15
So what you’re saying this is good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:16:55
I treat it like gambling money. $20 a pay is more than some people spend on lottery tickets, but I at least made *something*

The value of BTC doesn't have to go up to do this. The value of the dollar can go down.

I think people talked to their parents at Thanksgiving and now more people are buying in.

I used to take $20 a pay and “play the Bitcoin.” Over a few months of ups and downs but mostly ups it was worth $550 more than I’d paid into it. Then I saw bitcoin mentioned on BBT and sold it all.

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:42:18
I really just use it for paying for things with Bitcoin, like my VPN service, and like a savings account that gets *really* good interest. I had to cash it out a couple months back when my truck turned a wheel bearing into steel wool.

Well, I put in about $80 since I had to cash out and I’ve got ~$180 in Bitcoin. I’d have to figure out the actual numbers but it’s a damn sight better than the 1% APY my actual savings account gets!

Gee, look at the big spender here.

Give it about 24 hours. People will need to figure out how to buy them first.

Am I the only one who buys Bitcoin with the intent of actually using it?

Which is why I use it to buy Reddit Gold (which is a donation) and VPN access.

I haven’t listened to radio except when I’m in a store or someone else’s car in years. It’s streaming or downloaded audio everywhere. And the best part is there are no commercial, aside from the occasional one in a podcast. And no DJs talking over the song. And the ability to replay it as much as I want. And much better quality. 
But I’m sure this Internet thing is just a fad.
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:00:01
This is a good point. Gold is far more useful for its material properties than sitting in a vault somewhere.

This is how I feel about it. I got out at $17k but I admire Bitcoin for its decentralized nature. But until I can use it then it’s just a weird speculation engine. But I hope for the day I can use it or something like it. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:23:27
One thing I wish I had done at your age was to get used to just putting 10% of my pay in a savings account and forgetting about it. That's easy to do when your check is $250. Not so easy when it's ten times that and you have two kids and a mortgage.

I put $20 a month in so I have a little bit in bitcoin to pay for things like a VPN. Yeah, it was fun watching it jump up, and I took some profits and bought someone reddit gold, but I'm not changing my strategy.

Pump and dump would be dumping a couple hundred when the price starts jumping and then selling when you think it's hit a peak. I'm happy with it just steadily gaining value and using it to buy things.

All businesses require some form of government registration, even if it's just a license. If that constitutes a non-free market then these don't exist either.

I explained it to my dad and he only wanted to understand the technology behind it. Which was nice because usually it's people laughing about the suckers who bought at 19k.

Bitcoin won't stop being volatile until people stop trying to treat it like a pump-and-dump. I put $10 a pay into it and take it out when it spikes and use it to pay for my VPN service when it doesn't.
