I would expect BRK to behave similar to the market over the long term so that's about 7 % per year.

Interesting, you are correct. I wonder what the reasoning for this is, since they use capitalized letters for the unit symbols when it's a person's name.
I always use the symbols anyway so fortunately this hasn't affected me. The guide I like to use is the NIST SI unit guide by the way.

You obviously don't understand the bitcoin protocol at all.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:02:25
Yes it does. 
Imagine you control 51%. You mine a block and don't tell anyone about it. You keep doing this until your chain is longer than the official chain and then you add it to the network. Your chain is now the official chain. You can include any transactions you want (or none) because you mined the blocks. All blocks mined by others were omitted and you have not gotten all the block rewards as I stated in the previous post. By including no transactions in each block you are basically shutting down bitcoin. 
You don't even have to be malicious. You could just mine all the blocks and include all the transactions in your side chain. When you add it you will get all the rewards and nobody else will get anything.

That strategy certainly is not zero risk. There are no zero risk strategies for storing bitcoin. If you have a lot of bitcoin and people know it, someone could be looking through your window with binoculars or there could be a camera on your screen. Even with ideal computer security there is still risk.

Watt is normally capitalized even when talking about the unit. E.g., 42 Watts or 42 W are both correct.

I never said they would stop accepting credit cards. I just think that the credit part of the credit card is not that important in gaining huge adoption. It's mostly the extra features like points, warranties, and tracking your purchases that make credit cards really attractive.

You can short anything as long as someone is willing to loan you that anything.
If I borrow 1 BTC from you with the agreement that I pay you 1.05 BTC in 1 year, then I could just sell that 1 BTC right awah and buy it back right before I return 1.05 BTC. If the price went down I would profit.
I wouldn't recommend shorting BTC though. It's an extremely high risk bet.

4 people colluding have control of the network. With fiat, you need a lot more people to make any big changes. A consensus between hundreds of elected people.
With bitcoin you can just buy those top 4 people.
Bitcoin right  now is more centralized than fiat. Wayyyyyyyy more centralized. Some of the early adopters have huge amounts of coins they they can unload at any time causing huge volatility as well. The fact is that a few people have a lot of power over the entire bitcoin ecosystem. Also, with fiat I can give someone cash without dealing with any central system. With bitcoin you have to post all of your transactions publicly. This is central.
Bitcoin needs to decentralize it's power more for it to reach its full potential.

If you generate a random string of digits and hash that with the password, then how will you know when they have typed the password right the next time? If you only have that salted hash stored, then you will need to get that exact random salt again to verify that the password was entered correctly.

I said disrupt not kill. Miners would switch, but it wouldn't be instant.
Also, the government could force these 4 individuals to cooperate with them and force them to not tell anyone. Similar to what the NSA does with all the tech companies.
They could conceivably create a blacklist. It could be introduced in stages to get people to not panic. Start out with known terrorist addresses (how many people would switch pools over this?), then slowly add more addresses with no oversight. If these 4 major pools were all forced to implement this blacklist which pool is everyone going to switch to? 
Again, centralized mining pools are a huge weakness in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Double spending is not the main threat of a 51% attack. Controlling 51% of the hash rate gives you the ability to omit all blocks mined by other people and claiming all rewards for yourself. It also gives you the ability to shut down the network for as long as you maintain 51%.

Oh yes, let's use an ambiguous unit instead of a well-defined one. If you don't know what a uBTC is then you should be learning the Greek prefixes, not trying to invent new units thus making it ambiguous. If anything, use microbit instead of bit. Kind of like how people say micron for micrometre sometimes.
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:35:50
In the SI unit system it doesn't hold at all. Whenever a unit is someone's name it's capitalized.
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:46:28
Bitcoin is more centralized than fiat. All you have to do is convince 4 specific people and you can disrupt the entire system. Mining needs to be decentralized for Bitcoin to really take off.

Well, someone can easily shut down bitcoin if they get 51%. There is a real threat that can't be ignored.

A lot of people use credit cards for tracking their purchases, for the points, and for the convenience (of not having to go to the bank to get cash).

If you think a 50 % expected return for loaning money is not weird, then you live under a rock. The risk on this must be a near certain 100 % loss of initial investment. And that's assuming that this is not a scam.

Credit card companies profit immensely off every user, not just the people that carry a balance. Every time you use the credit card anywhere, the credit card company takes a cut. American Express cards charge ridiculous rates which is why most companies don't accept them.

Why not use real world data?
If you invested in the S&amp;P 500 via [SPY]( at the top of the stock market bubble in January 2000, you would have gotten an annualized 4.00% after all costs. That $1000 would be $1800 now.

Gold is purely speculative. It's only worth as much as it is because people think other people want it a lot.

That's not how the stock market works. When you buy a stock you are buying it from someone that owns the stock, that is, a current owner of the company. The company never sees a dollar of it.
Investment banks buy stocks from a company and sell them in an IPO, but after those stocks are sold people are using with each other. A company can issue stock to get money quickly as well.
