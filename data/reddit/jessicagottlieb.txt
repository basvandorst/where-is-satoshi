Actually not everyone is interested in bitcoin and anarchy. I'm pragmatic and do believe in it and the majority of mine are offline entirely but I like coinbase and I think I'll try gocoin (founder is a past colleague) for dogecoin. 
I've had bitcoin for a few years now and I'm not looking to change the world. I'm looking to not be left behind.

ugh. Now I remember why I hate ebay.

I would tend to agree but then we just got a pretty kicky new mayor in LA and I'm feeling good about him.

By 2 factor auth it would be safe-ish to add a text?

Go to your room, you're grounded.

So if you buy a bitcoin from someone does the private key change? What prevents them from having your private key? 
Such a luddite but so very curious.

That's so funny because when my friends ask me about my money I ask them how big their husband's penises are. 
In addition to shutting everyone up their expressions make me laugh for hours.

For the past few months. Plus a friend just picked up and moved to singapore to open a bitcoin bank/wallet. So, yes, lots of discussion and he doesn't like that he's not old enough for a debit card but he can buy things with bitcoin regardless of age.

It is tough to teach but I've given them fake interest rates. There's an online allowance system called ThreeJars.com and you can give kids interest for saving... it's handy because when they were getting $3 a week I could offer them a 50% interest rate for savings and then they'd get to see real compound interest make a massive difference in their lives. 
Now what I do is offer them 25% interest on savings up to $100 a year and I've explained to them that it's exactly the opposite of a credit card. Even though I can't show them how a bank will help them I can show them how a bank can cripple them.

Yes. Well he's 12. This is obviously the first time I've ever spoken to my children about money/savings/banking  /sarcasm

Agreed, though at $7 a week it's tough to diversify much.
