Do you need a centralised elite, or could you just have a sound apolitical money that doesn't allow the 2% to rig the monetary system? Better still if the manufacturing and production of that money was owned by the community as a whole. The very point of socialism is not to have an elite. Marx was in favour of markets, and spent all of his life examining their functions, he would have also condemned wholeheartedly the centrally planned prescriptive commissar Stalinist shitshow descriptor you have for socialism.

Because no matter how much bitcoin neoliberalists think bitcoin is merely a tool for hiding wealth, the CPC sees bitcoin as an organic step towards empowering the proletariat. Peer-to-peer transactions will remove the need for massive bank intermediaries, reducing the wealth/power of the super-rich plutocrats and flattening economies over a wider populous. China may have given up forcing communism in the short, but they are playing the long game. Marx didn't specify how long a socialist society would take to culture, he didn't specify how that transition would happen, but he did understand it would take time. Bitcoin is a transitional tool towards changing peoples expectations and fiscal relationships with each other. Decentralised technologies like the internet, bitcoin and DAO-cooperatives will strengthen bonds between groups of people and remind them that we exist within communities. The CPC may not be overtly communist, but the socialist agenda is there and they have their eye on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:19:09
Don't send it to coinbase, they have KYC and are being investigated by the IRS! Buy a Trezor, they seem a bit expensive but for securing your bitcoin its worth it. Get your friend to send to a wallet on your Trezor. Keep as many BTC as you can (as it will be skyrocketing this year!). Sell what you need using a service like localbitcoins. Sell in smaller amounts and meet in public places. I wouldn't bother the taxman, you'll just confuse him.

For those who don't know LNURL is a wallet standard that allows a simple GET request from a wallet. 
This allows static pay QR codes, being able to withdraw by scanning a QR, the ability to leverage LN for easy authentication, and much more. 
LNURL solves a whole bunch of UX issues with LN, and lets the protocol folks focus on the important stuff. All that innovation without even touching the protocol, and we are seeing real adoption without any big names attached. Innovation from the trenches. So far LNURL works in BlueWallet, The Bitcoin Lightning Wallet, Wallet of Satoshi, Zap are implementing, more to follow!

I'm not sure where you're from but mining probably isn't the best choice for you, it requires a huge amount of extremely cheap/free electricity and specially made miners, which cost a lot of money and would take longer than a week to get to you. Your best option is to buy BTC through localbitcoins.com or an exchange. Where are you from?
Edit: I just read your question again, I see your Mexican. Localbitcoins.com is probably your best option if you're in Mexico. I suppose you could be a Mexican in another country? I think in the USA users can't do bank transfers on localbitcoins.com because it breaks some law, you'll have to check your countries laws if you're a Mexican not in Mexico.

Dude, the lack of features has been its biggest feature! Bitcoiners understand that keeping the mainchain restricted keeps it secure, which is important when dealing with billions daily in volume! FYI Segwit and sidechains are a way of extending bitcoin without exposing the mainchain to lots of threats. Segwit will allow bitcoin to do anything an alt can, but pegged to the most immutable, decentralised, largest network. The alts you mention all could become sidechains utilising atomic swaps. This whole space is about to explode with innovation and bitcoin is positioned to be at the centre. Hopefully you will join the party

Excellent post, you're exactly right. If public figures are so willing to make such controversial decisions they should be willing to apologise if they're wrong. Their actions could have caused damage to an extremely valuable network, which would of hit users the hardest.

I did something similar for a pupil of mine whose first book they read was the excellent Player One. I put a few quid in a wallet and hid the recovery seed/brainwallet inside the book... I showed them the seed in the book and gave them a brief crash course on bitcoin. I told them to keep the book extremely safe and if in 2030 they know how to access the seed, it will probably be worth a decent amount

Antpool is 17% of the overall hash...If asicboost gives 30% advantage, 30% of Antpool's 17% is asicboost (or 5% of bitcoins overall hash)
If asicboost got patched would that 5% go to Segwit?

Because humans are the ones speculating on bitcoin. We just had a dip in price, that is most likely profit taking by some traders, price should resume, a short term trader might use that to their advantage. Technical trading is finding patterns in markets and trying to predict where they will go, hopefully with a 51% and over success rate - remember its not about maximising reward but minimising risk.

I always thought hodl came from "hold the door" and was disappointed to find out the actual etymology.

Best reason yet for dumping bitcoin.

The BBC is reporting 74 countries affected and more than 1000 targets, which is still increasing. Its all the news channels saying "bitcoin" which matters

Good, friends make a trustless system weak. Drivechains/LN make a much more adaptable bitcoin, which is why SW is a big deal

"Socialism is an entirely state run system, because you can't have commonly shared resources without a state to run them."
Bitcoin Socialism is an entirely code run system, because you can't have commonly shared resources without code to run it.

All the way! Quick buy ETH! BTC is no longer a store of value!!!

I understand the claim that bitcoin is pure capitalism. However, wealth will be more fairly distributed because of bitcoin. In the near future DAOs will be a large part of the economy, rules and algorithms decided by co-ops communities. Replace "State" with "Code" and the bitcoin revolution has room for socialists too.

Thought of this a while back, actually pitched it after a few beers to Elizibeth Stark and Olaoluwa, they amazingly didn't seem to get it. True story. 
You could easily ask for a return of a percentage of your wallets funds, then have that added to a liquidity pool. There could be a market of lenders (with front of house), which would offer you a percentage return for using your funds. With the correct bank-run fail safe you could even spend the percentage you allocated, and not receive the return, as the lender would have to commit to a float.

Loads of sell orders triggered at 3000. If it can pop 2840 within 24hrs it should be fine.
