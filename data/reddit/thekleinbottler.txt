The best investor in the world is never relevant. Nope. Not at all.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:58:33
True, but I don’t think that any average old Joe would want to spend all that effort and time mining bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:06:59
I agree with you. You also have to buy bitcoin with real money in the first place, which is what makes it so stupid.
However, practically everyone in this subreddit is brainwashed by thinking that Bitcoin is a lot better than it really is, so we really cannot convince anyone here.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:09:42
You seem to have a strong fetish for Bitcoin. Sorry I offended your sensitive ass.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:53:31
It seems like a scam, because you have these exchanges and you don’t know where they get the bitcoin from, it relies on miners to get free bitcoins and verify transactions, you need to buy it in exchange for your country’s currency, it’s very volatile, the creator is unknown, the code is managed by developers you might not even know or trust, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:02:09
They are actually God. They’ve managed to spy on everybody, still do, and are finding more ways all the time.
They know a lot more than we do. The United Staes government is powerful as hell.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:02:18
Where was your point going?
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:47:56
But what other ways do you think would exist in the future to buy BTC? Giving the Bitcoin Man a Bitcoin Blowjob?
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:29:30
Well, the NSA isn’t really just a “someone.”
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:29:25
How is gold related to crypto currency?
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:39:56
No, just bitching about weird things like taking the word “argument” literally. Please don’t take this as offence, I don’t want to offend you (although it looks that way).
It’s just that it’s weird how you take things very literally.
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:10:35
 Not everybody accepts Bitcoin, though. Probably 99% of people don’t accept Bitcoin.
I truly love the concept of Bitcoin, but it is extremely volatile and it makes no sense on how 1 Bitcoin is equal to whatever the always-changing value is in Canadian dollars.
If one day it becomes stable and becomes the new non-government touched medium of exchange across the world, that would be pretty cool, but bad at the same time as it is all digital, and having cash is very good in many things.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:08:54
That’s not a common thing
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:07:31
You’re a bitch.
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:35:14
Another reason why you shouldn’t be buying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:14:19
Thank you for taking the time to give such a detailed and helpful explanation. I really appreciate it.
I have two questions, if you don’t mind answering:
1. Since exchanges buy bitcoins, where exactly do they buy them from? If they buy them from other exchanges, then how is bitcoin obtained in the first place? Is it only mining (verifying transactions) that gives you bitcoin at the base of this system?
2. What would happen if there were no miners?
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:46:10
I hope you don’t take everything this literally in real life. Because if so, you must not have many friends.
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:56:39
There is no current situation.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:45:44
Bitcoin is a fucking scam. Nobody knows who really created it (who knows if the unknown guy has some way of giving himself Bitcoin anyway), it makes no sense that its value in Canadian dollars (or US dollars) is what it is, and it’s so volatile that it doesn’t even make sense to invest in it.
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:59:37
How do you know? What if he has some measures we don’t know about?
Yes, it is open source. But have you checked the code yourself? Who knows what kind of alternative workarounds the guy could have.
You may be ignorant to think that open source projects are automatically “safe,” but the NSA once confronted Linus Torvalds and wanted him to put ‘malware’ into the code of the Linux kernel. The NSA knew what they were doing, and so could Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:18:11
You can’t think of anything to counter his argument, so you bitch about his punctuation.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:51:32
Can anyone verify this info?
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:09:04
It’s not very clear at all, dolt.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:50:20
I never asked you for help. If you don’t wanna, don’t be a bitch about it.
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:42:05
Now you swiftly jump from Bitcoin into economics.
You probably don’t even know what economics is yourself.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:43:31
If more people accepted crypto and if it wasn’t so volatile and such a stupid system, I would definitely embrace it.
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:14:58
It’s exactly like bitching about the government. It’s like if you bitch about Justin Trudeau, you are in the wrong place (country).
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:57:33
And I wrote sentences as well. So why complain about the word “argument”?
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:09:14
And so what what?
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:38:09
If people didn’t ask questions in the first place, then how would Google have any answers?
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:49:35
It is. It’s an argument against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:20:54
Yes, but I didn’t say ALL.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:08:40
No shit
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:13:42
And that is Warren Buffet.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:26:27
... for what?
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:24:27
Well, no shit.
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:11:41
Stop babbling, idiot.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:32:41
So you’re inferring that you’re addicted to drugs? Sucks to be you. Maybe if you were a smart person, you would have never gotten into them.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:54:37
And you are one of those idiots. You don’t even know what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:19:21
All we can do is live life, and live with the current situation.
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:36:13
I don’t believe you. Send me your private keys when finished so that I can verify this information.
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:37:45
Bitcoin will never replace these currencies. I think that Bitcoin will die off in some decades in the future, and then maybe a new crypto currency scheme will roll in.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:09:57
You don’t know shit.
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:45:45
No, I’m not offended. It’s just that I made a neutral post about Bitcoin, and you call my behaviour idiocy out of the blue (your sudden anger could have been a reaction from you being offended). :)
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:09:29
I didn’t say any open source project.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:08:20
I don’t know what it is with you and your fetish for this Dunning-Kruger man, but that’s between you and him.
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:16:42
Looks very unoriginal. I can’t imagine why...
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:39:58
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:49:09
To you, it was idiocy. It doesn’t hurt at all, it’s just another opinion from some other random guy.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:17:31
Camereye is right. Without a backup of your private key, your bitcoin is long gone.
But don’t stress yourself about it too much. We all go through substantial losses in life and make dumb mistakes. At least now you know to backup your private key in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:55:09
What the fuck is the sidebar?
@_date: 2018-06-02 03:55:02
No, they are not known in the poorest countries. I once talked with one of my relative’s friends who is in the armed forces, and some countries he went to included Mali and the DR Congo in Africa, which are very poor countries, and the citizens there didn’t even have Internet, and most people didn’t even know the concept of the Internet.
You are speaking out of your ass. Quit misinforming people.
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:04:32
You sound like a kid who is brainwashed by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-02 04:09:01
It’s funny how you guys have a weird fetish for Bitcoin and treat Bitcoin as if it is some God, when in reality it will never replace fiat currency, and fiat currency will always be better not only because more people use it, but because there are no Bitcoin loonies and no Bitcoin bills, and without the Internet, Bitcoin would fall apart entirely.
ISPs control all of your Internet connections (every single person in this subreddit, at least), and so ISPs (with influence of the government) effectively control your ACCESS to bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a stupid system, because the people with the most mining power (most mining hardware and what not) are getting all the coins, and what if all Bitcoin wallets were misplaced by people? Once the 21 million bitcoin limit is reached and if the tiny chance of all that Bitcoin going missing actually happens, then what? You move on to another crypto coin?
Centralized currency has many advantages compared to Bitcoin, as well. More people accept it (and majority of people will always accept it), credit cards, money can be guaranteed to be refunded or given back (very useful in a ton of cases), more money can be printed if needed (there is a capped amount of Bitcoin), etc.
Bitcoin is not a solution to the current currency issues that we face today. It’s just a stupid concept that people are brainwashed into loving so that the people with a ton of bitcoins can get incredibly rich (as when more people join, the value of their bitcoins grow higher).
There will always be problems with things like Visa, and there are problems with everything. A cook messes up your meal at a restaurant. Baseman fumbles a good throw. Visa stops working temporarily. Girl accidentally trips and falls on the sidewalk.
The day that the Bitcoin system gets broken into and hacked (which it will), is the day that you are happy the world never switched to this silly scheme in the first place.
