Hey Max,
How do you decide on disputes? What is you standard procedure? What do you do in case of chargebacks since you allow many payment methods that are reversible?

Not that amazing. 
Limited to OkPay. (centralized) 
Limited by this weird microtransaction system so they can only use a single(?) payment processor.
Stupid name.
Bank sponsored.
Easily indentifiable transactions.

dann mal auf deutsch, vielleicht klapt's ja so:
ich habe deutlich geschrieben: 'zweigleisige übergangsphase' um dann (hier hängt's vielleicht) auszusteigen. niemand sagt, dass jm. auf geld verzichten soll. es geht darum vorbereitet zu sein und nicht die bemühungen einzustellen, weil visa gerade mitspielt. bei weitreichender akzeptanz der kunden hätte man es selbst in der hand zu entscheiden ob visa od. nicht.
was gestern deutlich wurde: im moment hat visa die kontrolle über backpage's business. es geht darum die machtverhältnisse zu verschieben und selbst das steuer in die hand zu nehmen.
übrigens: bitcoin als ideologie zu bezeichnen ist einfach falsch.

I guess that might work once or twice with one account, but I'm really not sure how easily the bank would accept your claim. You'd have to provide some form of proof I believe.
If you trade small amounts (maybe up to a couple of hundred euro) that wouldn't be very profitable for a professional scammer and a lot of hassle for a one timer.
Bank accounts can be seen as a rare good. You can't just open up 100s at will. If you manage to steal some (or many) they get closed down pretty quickly. 
I can't imagine this to be profitable, but I don't have lots of criminal intent, so I might be missing out.
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:17:27
This is why I made the post:
Do you see any clearer now?
How is bitcoin an ideology?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:24:52
I see, I didn't.
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:14:31
Paranoia striking again?
One thing I do: I have small amounts of bitcoin everywhere, phones, tablets, laptop...
i use wallets with small amounts and simple passwords (or none at all) everywhere. I do this to see if any device is compromised and determine my risk level. I've never had a satoshi stolen (in 3 years).
Rule  Save big amounts in ice cold storage (paranoia proof)
Rule  Relax

I was aware of that article and I know there are some really mean crooks out there.
I still haven't heard of a reversed SEPA transaction and I would trade bitcoin for euro via SEPA any time.
Btw. bitcoin.de do these kind of trades (btc/euro sepa) sucessfully for years.

I don't know. Why would they lose money? I'm talking about preparing an exit. That exit might be when visa decides to stop doing business. I thought I made that clear.
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:28:49
can you read?
The SEPA credit transfer is a duplicate, is technically incorrect, or has been triggered with fraudulent intent.
The originator bank triggers the recall within 10 bank working days of the settlement of the SEPA credit transfer.
please tell me how you ever reversed a sepa transfer.

You're doing god's work, son!

Thanks for the links. It's hard to reverse at least. The cases in three of the links are not very specific and even doubtable but I wouldn't claim they are fake.
I called my bank to reverse a random transaction I made recently. They told me that it's impossible. I told them I got ripped off, and they basically told me it was my fault because I sent money to a stranger. I asked how they could help, and I was told to write a complaint.
There are possibilities of how to deal with fraud risk:
- Limit trade volume
- Use accounts as scarce ressource
- optional ID verification
- ...

limiting factor is the payment processor OkPay

searched for sepa, localbitcoins, fraud with 0 cases of fraudulent chargebacks. Just did a very quick search cause i gotta run but Zero. 
Really, to me, SEPA chargebacks are a myth. Maybe you can poit me to a thread?
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:26:27
You're right. My point is a different one: In my opinion SEPA is sufficiently hard to reverse to make transfers for btc possible.
When lowering the incentives for crooks, you can make this a reasonable option.
As someone else mentioned before, the different spreads for different payment options on localbitcoins are a good indicator for its '[hardness]( SEPA spreads are pretty small.
There are no 100% options, e.g. a gun reverses 'in person' payments quite quickly.
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:52:20
SEPA has nothing to do with Paypal. Paypal is not recommendable, of course.
