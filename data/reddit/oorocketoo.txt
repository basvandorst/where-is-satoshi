yeah, it's just that it doesn't make sense to me. i'm not saying he's wrong, just that i don't see it.
i mean even idiots will start using their bitcions when just holding them causes them harm, so why is it that everyone is saying the opposite?
is everyone afraid that most people will hold their money but just enough of them will spend a bit to cause a more or less equilibrium in value? but so what?
or is it that more like what he said that employers wouldn't want to pay employees? if this is what you meant, then it means that currently the inflationary state of the currency is used as a sort of enforcement tool to ensure people get payed. that shouldn't have anything to do with the type of currency that being used. that is simply someone breaking the law, and law enforcement should handle that.

thanks a lot! makes a lot more sense now. i have another question if can answer please.
when the US was using the gold standard didn't the dollar constantly increase in value due to the rareness of gold? if so, what did they do to hold up the economy? (obviously they moved to fiat but it mean before that, during the gold period)

she painted a 400 million dollar target on Dorian's back. not only that but she practically said where he lived as well as posted a picture of his car with the license plate included.
she may not have threatened to kill him but she sure did give criminals wanting to make a lot of money an easy target.

i don't have much knowledge in finance but i really don't see how deflation is bad for bitcoin. 
so what if people holding on to the currency instead of spending it, eventually if too many people are holding and no one spending the value is going to decrease, causing inflation and thus making people spend. it just seems logical that a balance point will eventually be reached.

I have no idea what that is. Mind expanding on that a bit?

to add to that, most of the other ones are frequently used in the proving of mathematical theorems.
