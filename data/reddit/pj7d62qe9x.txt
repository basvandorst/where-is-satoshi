@_date: 2018-01-02 22:56:05
If I remember correctly, BIP70 happened near the same time in 2013 as discussions surrounding coin "blacklists" or "redlisting". That resulted in some really heated debates surrounding voluntary AML/KYC surveillance or having intermediaries control AML/KYC verification (which could open those systems up to farming for information by nefarious entities).
Honestly the whole discussion gets to be a tangled mess pretty quickly so it's difficult for me to remember for sure. I'm hoping that if I am wrong someone else can help out and clarify.

No it doesn't. The network will just route around you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:56:07
Sorry for the double reply but I feel like I should describe my definition of "decentralization". Bitcoin is described as a decentralized network because no central party is required to be trusted in order for the network to function. No banks exist that issue bitcoin. No transaction authorities decide which transactions are valid or not.
Every node validates its transactions, miners validate and include transactions in blocks, and collectively the network comes to group consensus on the validity of the chain.
That is why it is "decentralized". One party being inefficient in the way they broadcast their transactions (at their own cost mind you) does not modify any of the factors that make the network decentralized. The network and process of validation is still entirely decentralized.
This is the definition from which I work. From that perspective your point didn't make sense to me. That said it is clear you are operating from an entirely different functional definition of what "decentralized" means with respect to Bitcoin.

Every time someone quotes me a percentage it gets larger and larger. As a result I'm very skeptical of the current number.

The argument is it's because they aren't using segwit and they aren't batching. The argument isn't that strong though since the same can be said for the vast majority of exchanges out there. Coinbase is just the current most valuable target.
Surely Coinbase batching and using segwit would do a lot, but I don't personally think it would solve the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:00:34
I really wish there was a metric that only included archival nodes in ETH, and non-pruned nodes for BTC. I don't know how to find that measure but it seems a lot more valuable with respect to judging a level of decentralization of non-mining nodes than just a node count.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:46:04
No hype because it's not ready for general purpose use yet. That is still a very long way away. It still needs testing, implementation of splice-in/splice-out (their words for how you add/remove funds from a channel), large scale implementation and deployment of watcher-services to allow mobile wallets to secure their funds, and general wallet development.
Sure seeing movement is exciting, but to your average user it's not quite time for celebration yet.

Define "mass control". They have no control over the network. They have control over their transactions, and the market sets priority. They technically "control" nothing.

Credibility is not a measurement of the quality of a first implementation or integration with a technology. It also is not a measurement of the level of competence of a new engineering team. It has literally no bearing on whether or not they'll lead their product with segwit or batching.

Hence my question. I don't know of any _new_ implementations of segwit or batching at all. Meaning it must be something else like a reduction in transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:48:34
My understanding is that the discussions surrounding blacklisting and red listing were related but significantly different. Blacklisting was a threat to existing fungibility as it created permanently tainted coins that can never be spent via future use.
I thought that redlisting was an alternative scenario where a list of "bad" coins could be untainted through a voluntary AML/KYC declaration from the innocent user? Still not a great idea in my opinion but pretty fundamentally different in therms of objective, actual use, and implications.

Please do not turn on UPnP. 
UPnP was designed with the best intentions but it is something you definitely do not want on a network you want to keep secure! UPnP can result in you helping an enterprising hacker own your entire network instead of just one machine in the event that a compromised device ends up behind your router.
Examples of often compromised devices include: IoT devices, phones, laptops of visiting guests, your own machines, etc... etc...
The few moments of time savings you might get from UPnP is not worth the risk!

Which exchange? I've seen no evidence of any exchange implementing segwit and batching who hadn't already done so before the backlog started slowly clearing.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:03:28


As an individual yes. As an organization with a budget and limited engineering hours in a week... well that gets more difficult.
Organizations will only implement what they see will affect their bottom line most effectively. In this particular case there's very little incentive for organizations to implement. Customers are not clamoring for it. Competitors don't have it (so they aren't at a market disadvantage yet). And there are alternative strategies which might pay off better (more effective batching, etc..).
I just think that this early in the cycle people overestimate the value of adding segwit. I want it yesterday, but I completely understand the potential reasons why adoption might be slow.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:08:26
We will. This is largely consolidation of outputs. Once consolidation is complete we'll see a return to the previous adoption rate until more of the major exchanges implement Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:28:26
I'm not sure how this statement is at all relevant. Your perception of their current credibility has absolutely no bearing on their implementation/engineering direction.

Coinbase has no more control over Bitcoin than any other company. The fact that they can impact throughput does not make the protocol less decentralized.

The free market can only reign where the free market is allowed to operate. My friends in the US don't have the options that others might. They're limited to exchanges that don't outright block them due to US AML/KYC requirements.
That said, the free market is not just consumers... and the free market is speaking now. There are not enough users that are angry enough to hit them hard at all. The reality is that there is no good economic incentive for large exchanges to quickly implement Segwit at this time.
That might change over time. We'll have to wait and see.

Once you remove the need for a trusted 3rd party you reduce counterparty risk to just the payer and the payee. Bitcoin being cryptographically verifiable further minimizes the counterparty risk to the risk that the network is attacked, destroyed, or the blocks reorganized.
The reduction of counterparty risk for an online transaction system was something that was unheard of by many, unproven to some, and impossible to others in 2009. It matters because without it Bitcoin serves no unique market and has no competitive advantage over traditional fintech (all of which require trusted 3rd parties to operate).
You're not wrong about the cost or the speed right now. Bitcoin has massive growing pains and we've yet to see if it will grow from them, or be crushed by them and its competitors. The point of my original post is that we're still very very early in Bitcoin's life and the life of cryptocurrencies in general. 
You lamented that given 7 years Bitcoin isn't beating fintech. I'm just stating the case that 7 years is nowhere near as long as it feels like when it comes to developing a new base protocol that can potentially change the world. I'm willing to give it time to grow, and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next. 
For better or for worse at very least it will be one heck of a ride. :)

I'm aware that the average transaction size for an established wallet with many inputs and outputs is closer to 500-600 bytes, but for the sake of simple maths I chose a value that was both closer to the overall median of the network at the time it was posted, as well as presuming one input and one output as likely.
Regardless, thank you for the contribution.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:44:12
You're absolutely right that paying $5 fees right now is silly, but do the alternative fees you suggest even make sense?
While most people would probably gladly pay huge premiums  to see these kids smile, both 5 sat/b and 10 sat/b are crazy fees for a low value transaction like this.
Lets say you want to buy lemonade so you check the mempool and start thinking about a 5 sat/b fee (assuming an average of bitcoin  transaction size of 200 bytes for simpler maths) results in a fee of 1000 sat...or roughly 11 cents - a roughly 50% fee.
You're about to pay and then you realize that futures trading is incoming and you wouldn't want the kids to get short changed with a permanently stuck transaction if transaction volume increases over the next 2-3 hours and settles on a higher long-term average fee. So 10 sat/b is safer, but it's still a 2000 satoshi fee on a 2300 satoshi transaction.
Then you realize that 20 sat/b transactions show level accumulation in the blockchain and would likely result in very quick confirmation... but you begin to question how reasonable it would be for this transaction.
The discussion surrounding small value transactions and micro transactions in bitcoin has been around since almost immediately after BTC's inception, but this exact problem keeps coming up. Even at very low fee levels BTC just isn't great for small value transactions when BTC itself also holds high value. Small/micro transactions will always seem idiotic unless they're performed on a second layer which mitigates the fee problem or via another currency.

The lemonade stand is about both their smiles and the learning experience the lemonade stand represents. Giving the kids charity, while fun, doesn't really reinforce the experience I'd like the kids to have from my money.
I don't want them to smile because they're getting free cash. I want them to smile because they set up their stand, did work getting it put together, provided me with a drink, and got both my money and my happiness as a result of their work.
It might sound like a cop-out but that's why I'm not as interested in donating remotely.

The value prop of Bitcoin isn't just fast cheap transactions. It's fast cheap transactions on top of a decentralized network that doesn't require a trusted 3rd party.
That last part is what causes all the trouble. Without the decentralized and trustless feature there's no reason for Bitcoin. Unfortunately developing and running a decentralized trustless is time consuming and costly. Managing that cost is what Bitcoin and most altcoins are trying to figure out. 
Look at it this way, one of the protocols that powers e-mail (SMTP) has been around since 1982... it took until 2001 to really nail it down the standard that provides the features we expect today. 
7 years is nothing in terms of base protocol development. We're all just too used to instant gratification to truly appreciate how short 7 years really is in the grand scheme of things.

If only I had that kind of capital. I'd love to create two non-profit organizations, one of which would fund research into bitcoin security and development separate from any corporate interest all together.
The second would be the same thing but for general opensource development with grants paid out on a yearly basis based on applications from opensource projects.
Of course, in this imaginary world the grants would pay out in bitcoin. :)

I used to run a full node, and I took a lot of shit from people in this sub for doing so because "it isn't worth it for an individual". 
Other uses aside, I told myself I'd only incur the cost as long as I was actually transacting with the node. Since I can no longer reasonably transact with Bitcoin without incurring excessive fees I can no longer justify the cost of my full node so I've taken it down.
Once lightning is here the incentives will flip again, and I'll spin it back up. For now though, -1 node.

I like the analogy (I would have used Friendster vs Myspace) but I would disagree that there are no network switching costs.

Is it really ironic though? They are also the company that mined the first and second BCH blocks.
Instead of ironic I'd say "as many expected would happen".
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:36:41
I don't believe this is true. The very existence of the EDA would always encourage this type of behavior. At price parity (BCH and BTC being in the same ballpark) miners are still encouraged to game the EDA in order to increase profits.
Lets say the price of BTC and BCH are both roughly the same. Lets also presume that BCH gets super popular and rewards the same number of fees per block as BTC.
As a miner I now have a choice at any give time. Stay on BCH, or switch to BTC.
If the EDA has kicked in I have an incentive to stay with BCH since I can mine 45-50-ish blocks a minute, massively increasing my profits and scooping up rewards before the next BCH halving. If I do not do this, other miners will and I will miss out on profits when the halving does happen.
If every miner knows the above they will all stay on BCH until the difficulty is pushed up to where it is more profitable (barely) to mine on BTC. This might take a very long time since the BTC difficulty adjustment happens every 2016 blocks, and it would take roughly 2x as long as normal since hash power is gobbling up BCH.
Now when the difficulty of BTC goes down, and the difficulty of BCH goes up, every miner has a choice to make. If the fees and price of BTC and BCH are roughly the same they can either stay on BCH and make normal BTC type fees. Or they can all switch to BTC, lose no money (since the price and fees are roughly the same).
If they choose to switch back to BTC, they lose absolutely nothing. However they can gamble that enough people will leave that they'll push the BCH difficulty down with the EDA again, gaming the system, and allowing them to scoop up massive block rewards.
It has been demonstrated twice now that miners understand this and are more than happy to abandon the chain for higher profits and game the currency for short term value.
Please note that my hypothesis does not take into account the economic effects of the regular instability of hash power on either BTC or BCH. It also doesn't try and figure out the effect of the massive inflation rate that this gamed mining could cause for BCH.
In short, in my opinion the fiat being closer to the value of BCH doesn't change whether or not miners will game the EDA. It just changes /when/ and /how often/ miners will game the EDA. The EDA itself existing provides the incentive to game it. (Edit: clarified last sentence)
One important note is that the above is made easier and completely automatic with pools that support automatic switching, or push button switching. The miners don't even have to much work to switch.
I have another theory for why even a higher BCH price would still cause the EDA to be gamed, but I've already sent you a huge text wall. (Edit2: clarified this sentence)
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:42:42
Ahh I see. There's where we differ. I believe that since the existence of the EDA is public knowledge, and since its activation is predictable and easily detectable that miners would eventually figure that out and allow it to drop to increase their profits.
Basically the longer they wait the more profits they make. If some miners don't wait as long as them it's easily detectable (via block generation time) and they can hop back on and scoop up profits starting it up again.
I believe that if we started at price parity more and more miners would start waiting slightly longer, slowly causing a sharper and sharper EDA until we're right back to where we are now. Miners would be maximizing their profits which is what I believe they'd do in any case.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:20:08
I don't personally think we'll see sub 1k BTC again in our lifetime unless there are bugs in BTC, bugs in exchanges, or bitcoin itself has failed. If you're right, I'll be ready to throw my money in, but I'm not going to wait. If you truely believe in BTC's future the best time to buy was years ago. The second best time to buy is now. The nest best time will be later. :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:03:59
Why wouldn't you know that? if your reference is USD, and BTC went up by $300 but BCH went down by $90 you'd know the relative shift.
It's all perspective. If you're comfortable relating everything to BTC then use BTC. If you're more comfortable using BCH/ETH/USD, use that instead.
Random silly analogy: I feel like this is like arguing people should dream in Chinese when their native language is German.

I seriously doubt that there is actually another coin called "bcash". 
The commonly cited coin named "bcash", which is claimed to based on zcash, was very conveniently announced on August 5th, well after people started complaining about the use of the term "bcash" and after Bitcoin Cash proponents started getting angry about the BCH ticker being listed as BCH instead of BCC.
At the same time many detractors were making fun of Bitcoin Cash supporters for not "doing their homework" because they picked a ticker symbol already in use on some exchanges. 
Then all of a sudden this new currency is announced and Bitcoin Cash supporters start using the exact same argument against the use of "bcash" as a shortened name?
That's just way too coincidental for me. I'll know for sure in 2018 if the currency is actually released, but my guess is that it's not real. It doesn't help that the same anonymous blogger has also only posted about Bitcoin Cash and its eventual taking over of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:30:47
So you're not wrong, the chances are MUCH bigger on BTC than on BCH. But even though there many times more likely than on BCH, the overall likelihood is still incredibly small.
Ok so presume for a moment that there are tons of miners mining. If they all generate a block at the exact same time (or nearly same time) they would all publish their blocks and the block with the most work would "win" and the others would be orphaned resulting in lost work and no reward.
That sounds like the situation you're wondering about, and it's very real. The confusion you're feeling is probably caused by a mistaken presumption that this is something that happens often. It is not. This happens incredibly infrequently. We're talking usually fewer than 20 times a month.
Considering the sheer amount of mining power on the network I'm sure you can see how incredibly infrequent this sort of collision is. That combined with how efficient the network is at broadcasting new blocks makes it pretty unlikely to happen.

A full node is shorthand for running a non-mining node which downloads the entire bitcoin blockchain for validation purposes and helps relay blocks to other nodes in the network. The full node uses the history and consensus rules to validate that the blocks being relayed across the network meet the rules that it follows providing a safety check that the network is not accepting invalid rules.
I hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:01:43


Yes! Ideally nodes should stay up all the time. This will cost you electricity and bandwidth.


Ideally no. Practically? Yes.
Since you'll be installing software on your computer which is exposed to the internet, and which may contain bugs it may represent a security risk.
Also since your node's information will be propagated on the network you could become a target if anybody decided to target bitcoin nodes in the future.
As a general rule of thumb I would never run a full node on your main desktop machine or on a machine containing a hot wallet. Secure your coins separately.
Examples of ideal machines on which to run full nodes. Low-profile media PCs, old desktops from a few years past. Old laptops sitting around doing nothing. Etc. Set one up, plug it in, configure it, and let it run.
That said this is all work and cost for you with no real benefit unless you use your own full node to relay your own transactions and verify the blockchain for your own wallets. But that's a longer discussion for another time.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:49:48
I don't disagree, I just I consider major hash power switching onto and off of the chain every time the 2016DA kicks in in order to trigger the EDA to be "gaming the difficulty" via the EDA.

I agree.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:19:43
Nope! If you're behind one connection there's no reason to run more than one. Even for large organizations, if they need multiple nodes (lets say for load balancing) the best practice is to expose only one to the internet per method of connection and then connect all the others together with the internet node so that they sync through the single connection.
Edit: This is done to prevent nodes on the internet from trying to connect to internal only nodes which can't receive incoming connections.
So basically no. As a home user there's no reason to run more than one of the same full node.

I don't understand your point so if you wouldn't mind, I have some clarifying questions:
Why do you believe price parity is necessary to act as an extra (if occasional) incentive for miners to shift to BCH? I believe this incentive to always exist even if price is far from parity (like right now) simply because the EDA exists.
You seem to imply that if there was price parity that the EDA would not be killing BCH, is my reading of your post correct? If so, why do you believe price parity would stop the EDA from killing BCH?

I only agree in situations where the node is being actively used. If the node is sitting around unused it is not necessarily keeping the ecosystem healthy. In that case it's just taking bandwidth from nodes that are being used and shunting it to a dead end.

Both. If I remember correctly there was a flash crash of BTC to $0.10 early last summer caused by a bug I think. I don't remember if it was "real" and actually had associated trades. I thought it was just a bug in their database. If there were trades I'm not sure if they honored them. But you are correct, ETH also crashed to $1 on GDAX due to margin traders and the then newly enabled stop loss order feature. A big sell to triggered all the stop loss orders all at once causing the price to plummet for a few minutes.

I disagree. While the tech and philosophical arguments behind BCH are similar to those we heard with Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited, I believe this time is different. The politics in this space have changed. Society has changed. Worldwide adoption has changed. All of these things change the sociological, economic, and political stage where this fight is set. I believe to presume this is anything like the past is a mistake. 


I respectfully disagree. We're just using different definitions of decentralization. I believe you're operating with a definition that anything other than maximum decentralization is no decentralization. While I prefer maximum decentralization over all else, I also accept that other people in the world have different points at which they consider a system decentralized. Hence why I operate with a definition that allows for a spectrum.


You're right, on its own it is nothing. It's only if people and businesses use a thing that the thing has value. You and I may not want what they're selling, but that doesn't mean others are exactly like us. We've had multiple years of people saying they want block size increases despite many warnings of potential negative consequences. If those very same people believe BCH gives them what they want, they'll buy it, use it, and give it value. There's no way you and I can stop that from happening if it is what they want.

People always give me a crazy look when I say I pay for things in Bitcoin and just replenish after. I always tell them I only use it when there's a financial incentive, but they never seem to understand!
Buying a a meal for a bunch of friends or some goods at a discount and then replenishing my Bitcoin with the original cost + the money saved is a great way to get a few "extra" Satoshi without really impacting my savings in any real way.
To be fair it also doesn't impact my Bitcoin balance in any really important way right now, and merchants offering Bitcoin discounts are rarer and rarer by the day.

Decentralization is a spectrum, not an absolute. 
What's happening right now is the market is experimenting with the idea of sacrificing some decentralization and censorship resistance in order to provide some extra utility. Eventually the market will decide whether they're willing to give up the cost for the utility... and if internet history is any judge the average trader will give up pretty much everything and only realize the problem decades later. :(
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:18:57
That's absolutely correct. I can't believe I left that out, and I do usually include it. Thank you for the addition.

If you don't already know the answers to these questions there is a really good chance there is no benefit to you running a node.
Not to be flippant, just that if you had a real use case where it would benefit you you would already be in a position where you would have been forced to answer some of those questions already.
Not really a problem though! Make use of the existing network and enjoy!
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:59:01
Ah, if that's what you were trying to say that makes sense. I initially had a completely different interpretation of your comment. Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:19:28


Do you mean not to keep their coins ON exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:47:32
You probably will not benefit from running a full node. If you have plenty of bandwidth you should ask yourself some questions.
Are you ...
1. ...a business which needs to verify incoming transactions from many users for payment verification purposes.
2. ...a developer of software which needs access to data you can only get from a full node.
3. ...planning to expose your node to the internet so that it can be used by SPV wallets to verify their transactions with no financial benefit to yourself.
4. ...planning to host an Electrum server for Electrum users to sync against.
If you fit into one of these categories, then by all means run your node. Otherwise it probably isn't worth it for you or for the community at large.
Ninja Edit: Removed the old  (have ample bandwidth) as it is a requirement for all.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:30:35
Well your experience is great news then! 
I used to find a good discount with Bitcoin via online merchants a few times a month and in person a few times a year. Now when I return to the same vendors the discounts are gone.
My guess is that I'm just in the wrong region to experience what you are. Thanks for sharing your experience though.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:06:36
This is false. Exchanges and wallets can add custodial replay protection of the type listed above (or via a few other mechanisms).
Protecting against replay does not really _require_ any change to the segwit2x code base. Adding explicit replay protection to segwit2x code base may have been the responsible/reasonable thing to do, but it didn't happen.
This doesn't make protecting against reply impossible, it only makes it slightly more difficult/risky for individual users and institutions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:44:40
Just make sure you modify it to use the correct chain...
Edit: Oh, checking the commit history it looks like this may have been cleaned up?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:19:24
First question: Why do you want to build a full node?
Is it just for yourself? Don't build a full node. Save the money and buy bitcoin.
Is it for everybody? If so...  
Do you have ample bandwidth? If so...  
Do you understand that your node will cost you money with no benefit? If so...  
Are you a business that needs to make sure your transactions are valid? Or...  
Are you a nice person who wants to help SPV users validate their own transactions at personal cost to yourself?  
Do you understand that it will become your personal responsibility to keep the node secure and updated and peering with honest nodes?  
(Bonus points if you're in a region of the world with a low local node count.)  
If you made it to here without answering no to the questions then maybe it's a good idea. Just make sure to keep your machine up to date! If you do not maintain your node you're not helping the network.
If you're at all unsure your best bet is to save the cash on the node (a few hundred dollars after equipment cost) and buy bitcoin. Maybe in another few years that will pay for a node if you actually need it.

I came here to say this. People presuming that transactions will be "forgotten" are setting themselves up for trouble if they don't set RBF and don't know how to create a transaction that re-spends. Thank you for doing all the hard work. :)

This shouldn't be news to anybody running any mainnet experiment right now... if it is then you're in for a bad time.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:41:13
I don't think it will have any effect what so ever. For those committed enough to mine they will likely pay in whatever currency the manufacturer requires.
If they want Bitmain equipment they'll convert to whatever Bitmain requires, if they want DragonMint miners, they'll use whatever currency they have that DragonMint requires.
When it comes to setting up and maintaining mining operations the choice of payment method for hardware is such a small inconvenience that it likely will not matter at all.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:44:40
To you, but not to everybody. As I said, there is some sort of argument, but it is far from the only argument as you point out in your comment. :)

Between January 1st 2016 and Today there have been numerous changes which have sparked interest in Bitcoin resulting in more buyers, more scarcity, and a higher price.
The most notable changes from my perspective have been:
1. The US SEC's review, rejection, and [secondary review of a the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF](
2. [The UN experimenting with using Ethereum as a method of distributing secure "coupons" of value](
3. [Papers being released by the UN's research institute discussing blockchain tech](
4. Legislation both completed or in the planning stages which opens legal access to crypto currencies to people in multiple countries in the Asia/Pacific region.
5. The successful activation of Segwit (regardless of how you feel about it)
6. The successful fork of Bitcoin Cash without major price volatility proving the stability of the system (regardless of how you feel about Bitcoin Cash)
7. The continued Venezuelan currency crisis.
8. Public recognition of and support for currencies with privacy support like Monero and [ZCash in popular media]( resulting in more buys of Bitcoin (since bitcoin is one of the few methods to reliably trade into many altcoins).
9. Fear of the current state of US political relations reducing the buying power of the dollar driving people to hard assets such as gold and bitcoin.
10. A healthy dose of people who don't know the above riding FOMO into a technology they do not understand.
Short version: More public exposure in the past year than in the previous few years combined. More interest and more people who can legally access it. All of that combined with fear of war, catastrophe, or fear of missing out.
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:48:15
I'm not sure I agree. Transactions on BCH being limited to 1MB vs 100KB is pretty signfiicant. That means the transactions can be 10x larger, but the blocks are only 8x-ish larger. Combine that with the much cheaper cost of bitcoin cash right now and that means the vulnerability would be much easier to pull off on the BCH chain right now.
That is... if I understood the vulnerability correctly.
That said, Bitcoin ABC was patched prior to the security disclosure. Combine that with the much smaller number of nodes means that most of them are probably upgraded already.
In short, even though it's probably significantly easier to exploit on bitcoin cash, it probably won't cause too much trouble if someone tried.

I can never time anything (neither can most people). Luck aside, I also work a full time job and wouldn't dare touch my crypto holdings from an insecure machine or a machine I do not own. It just isn't feasible for me to watch prices. I settle for dollar cost averaging and not having to stress over "missing the bottom". ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:17:43
That's not high enough if you want confirmation within 1-2 blocks right now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:59:02
I had no idea what those numbers meant so I had to look them up. Bitcoin reference aside, it's also pretty impressive. Well done!
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:28:36
I disagree that you could make an argument that they count (according to your definition). At the current unconfirmed tx rate the mempool is growing. If they were getting confirmed every few blocks then the mempool would be holding steady or reducing.
(source: 
The real confirmed TX rate is closer to 1.89 tx/s over the last 24 hours. We'll get a better picture of the real confirmed TX rate after a few days of business-week volume.

Is there a way to make that site aggregate the values between 1 and 10 sat/byte? My own analysis of blocks shows that transactions pulled in are random samples between greater than 2 sat/byte, some 2 sat/byte, with a (rare) few 1 sat/byte... that would seem to imply that 2 sat/byte is not enough to guarantee you anything. You have to just win the knapsack lottery.

If Bitcoin is as resilient against attack as it was designed to be, then no. It's useful to remember that resiliency against attacks doesn't mean you can't be attack. It just means you have appropriate time and tools to effectively defend against those attacks.

I agree. I think batching is the lowest hanging fruit in terms of optimization. They did say they were looking at both at roughly the same time. I'm hoping both will come in fairly rapid succession.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:01:25
2 hours is 12 blocks. I said it's not high enough for an almost guaranteed 1-2 block confirmation time. I think we're maybe agreeing with each other but discussing different things?

I've had success with brass plates. Since the melting point is still within a few hundred degrees of an average house fire I make sure to keep them in a fire safe as well. Better than paper, not as good as steel.
If you do get brass plates make sure they are actual brass and not brass plated alloy.

That's complete BS. He can click on the transaction in the screenshot he sent you to find all the information you need including the transaction ID.
But as was said below, you can also find all transactions sent to your receive address.

I've believed from the beginning that antpool would end up with the ability to control a hash rate majority following the hard fork. That said if I were them I wouldn't commit that much hash power to BCC. 
Doing so risks devaluing the currency and hurting the very thing they want to support. They're acting in their best interests now.
Even if we want to presume they will become evil and attack BCC with a hash majority I don't believe it's in their best interest to do so until until there's a stable economic base to steal from.
Either way, if they have the ability to be a hash power majority, I believe they'll avoid actually becoming a hash power majority on purpose for a while, if not for forever.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:28:31
Good points. I wouldn't say that the differences in future price are insane, just that with such limited availability to information they evolved entirely different markets.
You're absolutely right though, availability will be the great equalizer, and I'm interested in seeing what real trading brings to the table. 
What an exciting thing to witness.
The creation and popularization of cryptocurrency and then the intentional forking of two major cryptocurrencies within my lifetime? Fantastic stuff. Politics aside, people are freaking amazing in their ingenuity.

Well said, though I'd say it's more like two scientists arguing about the results of two entirely different experiments testing entirely different hypothesis.
I want segwit, but it's also really easy for me to understand the trepidation surrounding segwit from its opposition.
I wouldn't call it reckless and stupid as the OP did, I'd call it reasonable and rational given their concerns. I just don't share their concerns.
At this point I'm convinced that both sides are arguing over completely different things but yelling at each other as though they're talking about the same thing.
Both sides talk about "scaling" as though it's their raison d'état, when in reality scaling isn't what's causing their problems. The schism is caused by the simple fact that their hopes and concerns are not in perfect alignment but they presume them to be. Both side's viewpoints can be traced back to the original vision of bitcoin but both sides claim the other's can't.
This is why I'm glad the forks are finally happening. The two sides are finally admitting they can't agree and are doing something about it. Eventually the shakeup will be complete and we can all argue about something different, new, and exciting. :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:53:03
It's only free money if you believe there are tons of users outside of BTC who are not invested in BTC just sitting around waiting for something like BCH/BCC to exist so they can buy it. That influx in value that wouldn't already be represented by BTC is "free money" to you as a BTC holder.
If you believe that all the interest in BCC is because BTC holders get it "for free", then the value of BCH/BCC comes from a reduction in value of BTC. There is no increase in value coming from external sources, it's all coming from BTC holders trading their value out in the form of BCH/BCC.
The reality is probably somewhere in the middle, but the money definitely isn't free if the market is sane. I guess then the question becomes: "Is this a sane market?"
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:39:22
The silent majority is the force that will decide which one wins, and in my limited experience the silent majority has more of a middle-ground position that differs pretty significantly from the yelling of both sides. This all adds up to me being excited to see what happens after August 1st.

If people believe in bitcoin they should just worry less about finding the bottom and just "average down". Then again I think many people are doing this already. :P

I was jealous for a bit but I got over it quickly. Jealousy will never get me anywhere. Luck is luck, and I didn't understand or value the utility and potential future bitcoin offers enough to buy in earlier.
If I was back in time with what I know now, I would have sold assets to buy more. But I wasn't, and I didn't know what I know now. Oh well, money isn't everything. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
