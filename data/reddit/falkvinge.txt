A good policy begins and ends with understanding the matter at hand, and since the pirate party as a movement is focused on net generation values, liberty, and technology, I'd be surprised if another party had a more favorable platform, even if - and that's a very big if - the PPIS hasn't taken informal steps already toward being supportive.
(When making policy, in general, you try to avoid talking about specific technologies. For good reason. You wouldn't want to see a law regulating HTML 5, for example.)

This is not true. By its definition, BIP101 will always have consensus in the bitcoin network (with the exception of announcing its own presence). Before big blocks kick in, it acts identically to Core, making it consensus by definition. If and when big blocks kick in, it is because a consensus has been reached to do so.
Therefore, BIP101 is consensus compliant in all cases and timeframes.

I have a very firm opinion, and that is the opinion that opinions suck. I worship hard data and let the data decide.
In this case, I would look particularly toward the data of 1) current trends - worst, best, average cases - when blocks start filling up, and 2) what the average transaction fees could be projected to be to even be part of the game of operating directly on the blockchain some time out - trying to answer the question if we're risking excluding all the very emerging markets that are turning to bitcoin for its availability and cost-efficiency, and which are key for global adoption right now.
I see a lot of people talking about "when blocks fill up". I think that's a false framing, as far as I understand the bitcoin protocol. A miner can find a block with any amount of transactions and broadcast it, reaping its transaction fees in the process, and most of the time, that probably will not be a full one-megabyte block even if all the transactions since the last block exceed one megabyte.
In other words, blocks will get "full" far after there were one megabyte's worth of transactions since the last block, for the simple reason that miners are trying to find hashes with a slight lag to the current transaction set. That lag, if significant (which I don't know if it is), would delay apparent fullness of blocks well beyond when the quota is filled in practice.
However, I don't have the theoretical math background to do the in-depth analysis on trends and data, so I'm listening to the discussions. I've gotten fairly convinced that some action is necessary at some point, but I think most people have arrived at that conclusion.

True. Humankind's population is expected to peak at **ten** billion, so that must be the target rather than seven - at least for the near term, assuming a negligible amount of non-human agents also acting as users of bitcoin.

Of course not. It's not like I have coded in at least a dozen languages and learned that they are good for different things.
PHP doesn't have the most basic QA enforcement like compile-time errors if you try to use a variable in a way it's not specifically typed to be used as. Instead, you get an undefined run-time behavior with implicit casts.
For a random media webpage, that can be ok, and even produce the desired result. For anything that requires rigorous control, like security or finance, that's disastrous.

I agree. Also, I think that somebody may be a bit shortsighted.
I have a fairly well-known name, at least in the tech community, but there is no way in hell I would trade the respect and recognition I've earned through hard work for a lifetime of money.
The reason is simple - once you're filthy rich through pissing everybody else off, how are you going to spend your money? There aren't any fun parties to be had, not many to have drinks with, and you're not very welcome wherever you go. I'm not rich by any means, but I'd much prefer my current being welcomed and invited and merely getting by to being shunned, despised, and living in several mansions alone.
Perhaps that was too deep and personal. Anyway, just a reflection on why I think it may be shortsighted.

They don't have to write their own signing code; I wouldn't have done that, either. This issue is about how the resulting signature is encoded into the transaction. If excess leading zeroes aren't stripped from the signature, bitcoin 0.8+ will reject the transaction as a whole.
It's the encoding rules that have changed, not the signature calculation.
EDIT: You're right about the misunderstanding of the txid being a permanent identifier, but that's a separate downstream issue.

There's a major flaw in this reasoning. Just because there's an extradition treaty, that doesn't mean you can be extradited if you break American law _on Japanese soil_ for something that is _not illegal in Japan_.
Extraditions are for when a crime was committed by Alice in country Bob, and Alice flees to country Charlie, trying to escape the jurisdiction of Bob. However, Charlie and Bob have an extradition agreement, so Charlie arrests Alice and hands her to Bob.
Extraditions are _specifically not_ for when Alice performs an action in country Charlie that is illegal in country Bob but not in country Charlie, and Bob asks Charlie to arrest her. In that case, Alice has committed no illegal action and there are no grounds for arrest, nor for extradition.
To give an extreme example, there are extradition treaties between many countries in the West and countries in the Middle East. Imagine if ME countries could start demanding that people in the West were extradited to them for not following Sharia laws, laws that don't apply in the West? Extreme example, but for purposes of illustration.

The problem is that once you tried to withdraw bitcoin and it failed, the coins were gone from your account, but still weren't where you withdrew them to.
So when I say that amount is "stuck", what I mean is that I tried to withdraw it but I didn't get it, and yet, the withdraws show up in my account history as executed.
So there's no money left on the account to convert and withdraw as fiat instead. If I had had my account balance restored, I'd try to withdraw as bitcoin again, trying to get a few more of the coins out, rather than selling and waiting/hoping for fiat.
Obviously, this is not the case for those who wake up to the Gox problems now when all btc withdrawal has been completely halted.

Hmm. In my mind, this scenario would practically be the exact same case as Karpeles running off with customer coins for his own benefit.
While there's technically no theft involved - the coins were legally Gox' coins at the time with clients holding a legitimate claim to them, just like money deposited in a bank - that's still very, very fraudulent behavior. Not to mention cooking the books.
It boils down to "who took the coins", and in this scenario, it's Karpeles (acting as CEO of Gox) who decided to defraud customers in violation of the ToS to save his skin, thinking he could cover the hole later. While he's not the first person to attempt this move, it's still at least a civil liability, and quite probably a criminal one, with the caveat that I don't know details of Japanese law.
Still, this is just one out of many possibilities as to what could have happened. The important observation is that _every single scenario_ involves fraud, conversion, theft, or a similar element.
EDIT/UPDATE: Also, do note that such a selloff of customer coins must necessarily have happened AFTER the summer of 2013. Before that point, there was no other exchange to sell them on that had anywhere near the volume required - and you don't get additional assets from making fake transactions with your own clients' assets on your own exchange.

This is how I plan to not need to pay any capital gains tax.
By never exchanging the money back to fiat, there _are_ no capital gains - those gains appear when you exchange your currency for X, X appreciates, and - importantly - you exchange back with a gain. And the quote is right on the money - the idea is to never have to exchange back.

In various ways, Gox had taken well over 2k coins from me over the years, mostly by screwing over noob traders like myself (see "insider trading"). At least that part's over.
Sure, it's possible and maybe even reasonable to blame that part on my bad judgment, just like it's reasonable to blame this loss too on my bad judgment. Part of me is happy to know this is the last of my Gox pains, even if they cost me well over 90% of my initial holdings.
As the writing on the wall became clearer early January, I started withdrawing everything from Gox, a little at a time up to my daily limit. Most (maybe 75%) of the withdrawals didn't go through. After a week and complaints, the failed withdrawals reset to my account, at which time I could withdraw maybe 25% again, in small amounts until my account was "empty". Wait another week and so on, getting a little more out in cycles of one week, until one day, there were no withdrawals anymore.
Time to heal. Long live Bitcoin.

No, I haven't changed my opinion on bitcoin once. I did observe that price manipulation was taking place on Gox at one point, stating that bitcoin was "currently overvalued" compared to the utility value, and that observation of bot manipulation on Gox was later vindicated by a much more thorough analysis by other people.

My problem with that is that I tend to put my skills to changing the world in the geopolitical space for the values of freedom and independence that I believe in, rather than getting rich personally.

Yes. I stand by that assessment, based on the numbers I ran (I didn't just pick a number out of thin air).
However, I _also_ stand by my assessment that the breakthrough application of bitcoin will probably hit around 2019-2020, based on patterns of earlier disruptive technologies. Only when that breakthrough application hits, will mainstream adoption pick up for real (and keep growing from there - compare YouTube, how big it was in 2005 when it was the breakthrough for directly-watchable indie video clips, vs. how big it is today).
EDIT: It should probably be added that at such a bitcoin valuation, the value of the USD itself has been heavily undermined. So see it as "the equivalent of today's $1M value" rather than an exchange rate.

As a side note, this also illustrates why bitcoin isn't good enough for mainstream yet. Any tutorial considered best practice, as cold storage is, that contains the words "...open the laptop and resolder..." shows that bitcoin's usability is still at the early-adopter stage. :)

I know. And for this reason, JavaScript would be equally bad for an SSH server implementation.
Even the most rigid languages have some mix of static and dynamic typing, btw. C will throw an error if you mix an int and a string, but is completely fine with mixing a char and an int. C# will throw an error if you mix a char and an int, but not a shortint and an int (though assigning the larger to the smaller could get you a warning).
And an Ariane-5 rocket was destroyed because of uncaught exceptions in Ada stemming from int overflows IIRC. Ada, with its ridiculously strong typing, isn't safe from human error either.
But having variable names unchecked (a mistype gets a "null" instead of an "undeclared variable"), variable types unchecked (send a string as a date parameter? No problem, we'll parse it for you according to the locale, which you don't know about!) and so on is not the way to go about anything that requires rigorous QA.
Though admittedly, everything does _not_ require that level of QA. Sandboxed UX code typically doesn't, for example. But security and finance certainly does in my book.

We won't be drilling for fracking or harvesting tar sands for oil any longer. Instead, we'll have multiple moon bases mining Helium-3.
We're likely going to have nontoxic residential thorium reactors, with fuel pellets costing a week's pay or so powering a household for two decades apiece.

Thanks for this. You are completely right, and the people disagreeing with you are completely wrong.
A lot of the bitcoin community seem to be approaching the subject from a purely technical angle, which was Gox' mistake in this as well. As a client of Gox, your agreement and business is with Gox, and _Gox alone_. You aren't buying to, and selling from, other traders. You are interacting with Gox only, from a legal business perspective.
You don't even know who the other traders are, and have no way of contacting them, which makes it theoretically impossible to make an agreement with them. That's what the exchange is for - intermediating. But like a man-in-the-middle attack between buyer and seller that skims 0.5% of the transaction, that also means that the buyer and seller are _only_ interacting with the exchange, and never with each other.
The terms "market order" and "limit order" are trader instructions _to the exchange_, not an open offer to a seller or buyer.
This matters legally because if the exchange gives you a rate and you accept it, that's a formal quotation, and if you accept, that becomes a binding contract between you and the exchange.
This isn't rocket science. Both Bitstamp and the now-defunct Tradehill got this perfectly right: the very basic concepts on which you build a business. If Stamp or Hill made a bad quote that their orderbook couldn't fill, they took responsibility for it, just as they should - and Tradehill even took some extra height in their "buy immediately" quotes for this fact.
This is how all businesses operate. They give a price based on how they think they can profit. Most of the time, they get it right and do profit, but sometimes, they don't. No business gets to deliver at another price than the agreed one because they discovered they couldn't profit otherwise: that's their problem and theirs alone.
Also TBH, this was largely an interface thing at Gox. If they had just asked "Buy X bitcoin at best market price?", it wouldn't have been an issue. But they didn't. They asked, very specifically, "Buy X bitcoin for Y USD?". At that point, they're making a formal offer. This, compounded with the fact that their USD trading page was displaying trade prices from non-USD markets (and which were completely off), presented me with an offer that Gox apparently had no intention of fulfilling.
I find it absolutely astonishing that people in the bitcoin community are downvoting and dismissing the basic concept of an offer/accept/contract sequence and the concept of exactly who you're doing business with as wrong in a business context.

I am summarizing a lot of sources that, when taken together, appear reliable enough for me to write an article on the subject, summarizing the statements of those sources.
As our discussion leaves the article scope/depth and starts discussing exactly how Gox software calls what APIs, I lack a) detailed enough knowledge of the bitcoin protocol and b) insight into the specific code at MtGox (the black box) to make a qualified statement. I can say "it seems likely, based on the symptoms I can observe and my technical understanding".
What I have understood from my sources, and which is consistent with my own observation of events, is that Gox has broadcast padded signatures in a way that's invalid in bitcoin 0.8+ - they fail in the IsCanonicalSignature() function. This is what I write in the article, although I didn't state that it's the signature that's been malformed - that level of technical detail wasn't necessary for the article depth.

This is technically correct. However, one of the key points is to illustrate his overall attitude. Also, there's the note in the comments on how he plans to integrate this into a production library.
If this were solely "look at this cool thing I built", that could be impressive. When that "something" is the security equivalent of a  packed-dynamite grill stove filled with thermite, not so much.
But then again, that's my take on it. Many do cool C64 demos still, despite having absolutely no production value. I think that's the key line here - a confusion as to whether this was production code or not.
Karpeles' comment would indicate that his intention was just that. He even says straight out, "re-implementing RSA in pure PHP is not a bad thing." But even if that wasn't his intention, it would still be a red supergiant flag for me, that article and his thoughts in the comment field.

Well, these are two separate issues, aren't they?
First, I think it's prudent and appropriate that I disclose that I'm personally affected by the subject matter.
Second, as you point out, why the frak did I hold coins on Gox? The answer to that is simple - I didn't trust my own technical skill to secure my computer at home to hold them, and figured an online well-known service would be a safer place, as any losses would be covered. While they had displayed growth pains (to put it nicely), they had never displayed _malice._ It seems I may be paying a very high price for that judgment call.

I can't say for sure whether the Gox code has now been updated to produce correct transactions - different sources make different judgment calls on that specific issue. What I am saying that it didn't produce correct transactions during a time period, and that behavior in the past is causing accelerating problems downstream (=now).
Obviously, if the code _still_ isn't fixed, the problems are exacerbated.
I am also saying that the malleability as such has been eliminated as of bitcoin 0.8+, and that the root of the problem was that goxcode didn't care.

Well I'll be... you are right and I was wrong on my own history. I traded a lot early on, thinking I could learn that game too just as a bonus of dealing with bitcoin (I couldn't and lost a ton, but that's beside the point). As part of trading, I tried to sell at the top and buy back in at the bottom, which usually turned out to be the other way around.
You're exactly right that I went all-in at about $7, went out at the same price on the way down, and got back in again at $3 a couple months later. I had just forgotten about that particularly long out, they were usually on the order of days or even less than an hour. I had never abandoned or lost interest in bitcoin (as I got the impression you were trying to say I had); to the contrary, the charts were permanently up on one monitor back then, as they still are today, and I was following discussions and trends everywhere, as I still am.
But you're exactly right in what you're saying. I was just hearing you say something else, that I had lost interest along the way.


Thank you!

It may be. However, I don't see an uncensorable payment system - or a store of value - existing without having commercial value _as well_.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to allow me to clear up a few misconceptions. I am not siding with Hearn, as you put it - in fact, I don't know his values and haven't seen his code.
However, I have observed that there has been an increasing pressure to increase the blocksize, one that development leadership has consistently ignored. This pressure has been backed up with enormous amounts of data, graphing, and forecasts that also have turned out to be correct.
As a bystander, it has been and is obvious to me that the leadership was intentionally making the decision to restrict the blocksize limit, well aware that doing so would drastically change the behavior of the bitcoin network by pricing out microtransactions, pricing out unbanking the third world, and introduce uncertainty as to when transactions were irreversible merely through conscious nonaction. There have been reasons given for these decisions, reasons that make sense if you come from one value set, but not as much if you come from another value set.
When the community has repeatedly voiced its concerns about imminent unavailability of third-world unbanking and microtransactions, due to an imminent fee market, the leadership has pointed to a Lightning Network which doesn't exist and which has no point in time when it may start existing. In the IT world, we've seen this pattern all too many times.
Regardless, the pressure kept building, and with the advent of deleting discussions that didn't fit the leadership's narrative here on the cat was out of the bag. Once you start suppressing factual discussion because the conclusions drawn by data presented don't fit your intended roadmap, liberty geeks are not content with accepting deletion, but will start seeking ways to route around the damage of the network.
This pressure - the rift between leadership and overall community - has now reached a boiling point where it looks like we may have a hard fork, or at the very least, a change in direction from the current leadership. This is well in line with Satoshi's original vision, which was adamant that the longest chain is the definition of bitcoin.
So as a sideline observer, it was obvious that something would change, and probably soon. This is probably one of the least dramatic ways to do it. That's completely regardless of what people have done in the past, which I respect utterly.
I do not side with people; I side with ideas, observations, and data.
Last but not least, pointing out flaws in somebody's reasoning and saying what aspects they missed is not my idea of disrespecting somebody. I am obviously aware of Mr. Cohen's immense contributions to freedom of information and culture, as I believe most people are, and always have an open torrent client, seeding my books and other material. When I'm wrong on an account, I appreciate people telling me so and why, so I get a chance to re-evaluate.
Therefore, thank you for taking the time to write. I hope I made my impression of the situation clearer.

Wait a minute. Is your entire evidence for this claim that it can technically be done?
Deploying 100 nodes on one subnet is exactly how you deploy 100 nodes in one location. You create a VMware image (an OVF template) and basically say "start 100 of these". They will differ only in internal IP - sometimes allocated from a range in deployment, sometimes dynamic - and their hostnames will differ only in a serial number at the end.
I'd like to see some more evidence of this network routing happening, please. Or actually, any kind of evidence that this is the case. Merely pointing out a non-standard configuration on multiple nodes on one subnet does not mean it's all one and the same node.

I think this is important longer term, but it also collides with some of bitcoin's fundamental idea of controlling your own money (instead of asking somebody else to control it for you).
In the near term, I foresee Paypal-like services handling such subscriptions where you deposit enough money to cover your running costs. The alternative, opening up direct access to your wallet for irreversible transactions, is a major can of worms...
But the use case is definitely necessary. Just look at how easy it is to buy on Steam today with Paypal. It should be as easy to buy with bitcoin.

No, Mr. Cohen is completely wrong here on every account.
Bram Cohen addresses Mike Hearn's quit as though it was full of technical rationale. This is actually a common mistake among geeks, but it was nothing of the sort.
Hearn pointed out that bitcoin's current problems are not technical, but _social_ in nature. This goes well in line with project management experience - most projects don't fail at all on technical merits, but on social issues.
Cohen misses this completely. It's a complete whoosh.
Also, for what it's worth, I observed basically the same set of problems - _mutatis mutandis_ - before Hearn's post. I agree with the overall gist of it, but sharply disagree with the conclusion that it's the end of bitcoin. It's a roadblock, one that bitcoin will come through, but probably not like a lot of people think right now.

Indeed. But without the ability to exchange it, a store of value becomes worthless. As I see it, all of bitcoin's promises - store of value, censorship-resistant payments - hinge on _also_ disrupting and displacing today's payment networks.

I've talked about the pattern of social change many times, and compared the _growth pattern_ of net generation policies to how the liberal, labor, and green movements grew as children of their time.

"We’ll be the next big political movement, following the liberals, the labor movement and the green movement."

I'm confused. Why do you think I don't know how to calculate a fee? The difficulty lay in estimating the finalized transaction size in Armory, and my frustration was with the insane fee that resulted (which was in the correct ballpark, even if $6 would have sufficed when I chose to go with $10).

There are two aspects to this.
First, I'm of course free to engage in community discussion exactly as much as I want at any time. Just because you're not happy with me responding to questions, that does not in any way obligate me to keep providing detail. We all have our life priorities and lately I'm preferring to write production code for the ecosystem instead of being another voice that adds drama.
This observation - that I choose to engage in various amounts over time - does in no way, shape, or form disqualify ideas, logic and conclusions I put on the table when I do engage. In fact, ideas and conclusions put on the table for discussion should stand completely separate from the individual putting them there. It doesn't matter if it's Charles Manson as long as the ideas and logic are sound.
Second, I did respond to your concerns. It may be that you're not happy with that response, but that would be a separate matter. As for the Armory feature, AFAICT, it does not apply to multisig as explained, so did not apply to the discussion.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:38:44


Basically, I try to optimize the effect of my efforts. Trying to discuss anything on or on the mailing list is a complete waste of time if it disagrees with the Core echo chamber, so as I see it, trying to contribute to the technical discussion is utterly pointless.
**This, and not Segwit, should be a much bigger concern than it is.**


I didn't "use" anything. I was in an interview and responded to questions to the best of my ability. I do so often. This time, a few others found my thinking interesting enough to spin off a discussion about it. That doesn't make my ideas or reasoning valid, only upvoted, for people's own reasons.

I think that's one of the weirdest things said about me. When I started the Pirate Party, people called me libertarian and communist at the same time. Sometimes in the same sentence. A mechanism of identifying me as "don't agree with" -&gt; "not on their team" -&gt; "the opposite of their team".
I self-identify on a scale from libertarian to anarchist, depending on the specific issue discussed. I am a diehard defender of capitalism, especially from a moral standpoint, and was a speaker at this year's Anarchapulco. That's quite far from being a socialist.
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:26:36
"Knowing how bitcoin works" is, of course, a relative concept. It's a long grayscale.
I have studied the whitepaper and its sourcecode, made extensive experiments, and more importantly, I'm writing production code using bitcoin for live automated payments.
While that doesn't make me the very most qualified individual, I'd be surprised if it didn't put me in or near the top percentile as to technical understanding of bitcoin.

This is a very odd response. It's basically a textbook strawman saying why BIP-62 is bad. At no time did I advocate the BIP-62 solution to malleability.
I do suggest an alternative to scaling in this interview, namely BitPay's adaptive blocksize. Raising the blocksize to 2MB at this point doesn't solve the underlying problem of a fixed ceiling.

It's hard to speak of a factual negative _outcome_ of a technology that hasn't been put into production yet. But I can make observations and judgment calls based from what I know about it and my software engineering experience, which is what I did.

Ethereum exists in 196 countries at the same time. Just determining jurisdiction is going to be interesting, and the U.S. has no bearing as some kind of default jurisdiction or default law in a by-the-letter smart-contract matter like this.

Miners want to be treated like the customers they are, and they aren't being treated like that.
They see no reason to run code which doesn't benefit them, and they're entirely right in claiming the prerogative of choosing which software to run on their own machines.
In other words, if "it's the miners' fault" that Segwit doesn't activate, that's the equivalent of blaming the customer for not buying a product or service. This is never the case, of course: if the customer doesn't buy, then the offering is not good enough.

This is curious. You're arguing from a point that the only possible - indeed, the only _allowed_ direction defined as "progress" is the way you're pointing at. You know, exactly like politicians tend to do before elections.
And then you follow it up with,


And I have to wonder, do you not see that political posturing is exactly what you're doing here?
What's happening is an election. This is the Nakamoto democracy at work. If SegWit doesn't reach the activation threshold - and I sure as hell hope it never does, not do I expect it to - then _it is not good enough_.
It is not posturing.

A more correct translation of that word would be "mission van" or something similar.

Hi thanks for addressing the issue. I'm running Armory 0.93.3 and the bitcoin PPA is in my software sources (meaning I "subscribe" to Core updates to my system).
While Armory does estimate fees for ordinary transactions, this was a _multisig_ transaction, and there was no way for me to tell neither the size of the transaction nor the estimated fee per bytes. I suspect there are different code paths involved.
As the transaction size is mostly esoterical to users, and not interesting to non-developers, may I suggest a minimum fee suggestion for the multisig part to be introduced as well?
@_date: 2016-02-27 02:54:41
I believe I did revisit the post just over a week ago before I headed to a conference. Apparently you believe that there are still outstanding issues; thanks for pointing this out and I will take a second look over morning coffee.
As for the factual claims made, that the fees for a transaction were in the $10 range which is a complete game changer for bitcoin that prices out a lot of business cases, I don't see a cause to retract it (as you pointed out yourself, the calculated fee was $6).

There is such a bar, but I would argue it's really high. Even people living on $2 per day can afford to rent a $4-per-month VM, especially when a couple of people share one.

Hi Jörg, I'd love to elaborate!
The important thing is that nobody needs anyone's _permission_ to set up a node to verify transactions, or more probably, to see their own payments arrive in realtime without the need to trust a third party's word on it.
In this, it is similar to being able to set up your own mail server to receive mail, as I have.
I also run a bitcoin node, as I want to see payments coming in realtime.
**But nobody would dream of preventing people, who don't have the knowledge, capacity, interest, or money to set up their own mail server, from using email _at all,_ or even suggest something to the effect they're not using email properly. To the contrary, hosted mail is the backbone of the vast majority of mail communications today.**
In the same way, if bitcoin is to take off, it must break out of the early tech-savvy adopter crowd. In order to do this, you can't expect every single bitcoin user to also run their own bitcoin node, as I read to have been the overarching sentiment in the legacy bitcoin community -- or indeed, have any sort of _interest_ in running one.
**In other words, the difference is one of _can_ vs. _should_: It is important that every user _can_ run a node, from a technical perspective (not a financial one), but the notion that every user _should_ run a node is completely unrealistic.**
That's what I mean when I say the notion of every bitcoin user running their own node is as dumb as every email user running their own mail server. The key word is "every", and the focus is on maybe ten years out.

You should expect Bitcoin to reach USD 1,000 if it develops its tool ecosystem that is already underway, but fails to develop mass attraction because of usability or market issues.
If it does hit mass attraction, and becomes a favored internet currency that displaces credit cards and international trade reserves (not unrealistic), a reasonable best case is in the $100,000-per-bitcoin range (about 3% of the world's money supply).
Of course, this is a high risk gamble.

I didn't, I still hodl. However, I lost quite a bit on the Empty Gox collapse, even though I saw the signs early (I tried to withdraw in portions of maybe 100 btc per withdrawal, but a number of withdrawals failed and I had to wait a week to retry, then another portion failed, wait a week, and so on.)

I'm absolutely still a fan of bitcoin. However, the post where I explained why I put all my savings (and credit) into the nascent currency was in [May 2011]( not late 2013.
I did lose a lot - I think the technical term is "metric fuckton" - of coin in the Gox collapse. Innocently, I thought that keeping my coin with a third party was safer than trusting my own security, as they would reimburse me for any losses that occurred. Now I'm significantly poorer but wiser, and I still have quite a bit of coin.

Hmm. A difference in nuance: I said it would take ten years for somebody to get usability right. That's what it took for streaming video (streaming GIFs in 1995 to YouTube in 2005), blogging (primitive tools in 1994 to WordPress around 2004), and why not Facebook (SixDegrees trying the concept in 1997, Facebook launched 2004, solved its usability 2006-2007). Therefore, I predicted that mainstream usability would be reached in 2019.
That doesn't mean it reaches mainstream acceptance immediately when somebody gets usability right. YouTube has kept growing since its launch in 2005, and it's arguably enjoying such acceptance now, but it can be asked exactly when that was achieved. It wasn't in 2005.
A corollary of this observation is that the service that gets bitcoin usability right has not been founded yet.
I also agree with your meltdown prediction. I don't think bitcoin is mature enough to step up to the plate at that point, though. If it had been a few more years, things could have been far different. (For an illustration of this, look at how bitcoin plummeted along with oil prices, as investors went into full risk-reduction mode.)

I have made no secret that I traded initially to try to catch the swings. I stopped doing that at about $3 valuation and mostly just held from there. That's the "simplifying the story a bit" part that's right in the article.

Hi Hermel,
I did attempt to take the store-of-value utility into account in my ballpark estimates, but perhaps that wasn't clear from the article, I will gladly admit that.
You will notice that the money supply value in the article is calculated as total known production divided by average USD velocity. Using the USD average velocity is an attempt to factor in every typical use of a typical currency, specifically including a store of value.
You may have a point that bitcoin is more gold-like than USD-like, but I would also argue that you'd need to put a stake in the ground in order to even attempt an utility valuation. Ballpark precision is the best we could possibly hope for at this point, I think.
Cheers, Rick

It's a good question. In general, I'd say it's a bad idea to borrow for consumption, because it raises your base expenditure level and leaves you with debt once the party's over.
After all, these kinds of bonds typically run over a fixed time period - such as being due in five years. Once the five years are up, you don't know if you're getting the same interest rate again (like zero).
However, if you have an investment opportunity that gives you better return on investment than the interest you're paying for the debt, go right ahead. If you can straddle an interest differential, paying 2% in interest and getting 5% return on investment (or similar - you get the idea).
At the national level, borrowing to cover consumption is even tougher, as it sets an expectation of what the baseline services are. It becomes a political problem, not just an economic one.
So I'd say it's not so much a matter of "is debt a problem". It doesn't have to be. It's more a matter of whether you're borrowing to invest or borrowing to consume, if you ask me.
As for the world currency standard, that's not going to last forever, like you say - like the Pound Sterling wasn't the currency standard forever. That doesn't preclude enjoying the party while it lasts and thinking long-term.
(This wasn't really an answer, was it?)

Using the USD average velocity is an attempt to factor in every typical use of a typical currency, specifically including a store of value, economy in its own right, etc.
I wouldn't argue that USD is a technological advancement so much, though... but ballpark precision is the best you can hope for in this market, I think.

There are as many reasons as there are people trading.
My favorite reason is that bitcoin is following a sinewave downchannel perfectly, mirroring the downtrend from 2011 very well, and that it had been hovering at the sine peak for 4-5 days, so a downturn was expected.

Ex-fucking-_scuse_ me? I went all in at $7, and borrowed _yet more_ money to buy again at $31. I did not sell at the peak - if I had done so, I would have been financially independent today. That position at $31 just recently came into profit: I _bought_ at the peak in 2011.

There seem to be a lot of people reading strange things into this.
The full picture is that I'm still trying to learn trading, and I'm buying and selling all the time when I think I detect changes in the market. When I say "currently", that really just means that instant. It may not be true 10 minutes later, or 10 minutes earlier for that matter.
This has also caused me to lose a lot of my position, as I'm a total n00b in that particular trade. It would have been tons smarter to just sit down and be happy, but obviously I wasn't smart enough to do that when I had a learning opportunity.
I see that some accuse me of attempting to manipulate the price. I would gravely overestimate my own impact on the market if I thought anything I wrote had a snowball's chance in hell of affecting the price when I think aloud from time to time.

Well, I can't see any other way to do honest data analysis, really.
If your assumptions are pointed out to be wrong, the only honest way to behave in my mind is to update the article to include this fact, include the updated data, and re-evaluate the conclusion.

How would you argue I should have done otherwise?

I didn't say they were _worth_ $1 - I tried to calculate their _utility value_, as separated from their speculative value. Essentially trying to split their current worth into types of value.
Also, I got the numbers quite wrong, which I added in an update, and the comments ripped my reasoning to shreds, which I learned a lot from.
But yes, I'm that guy. Just taking the opportunity to clarify.

You have the transaction log. Your sending of $80 at that exact time should have been plenty of evidence enough, shouldn't it?
In fact, _everybody_ has the transaction log. And with Bitcoin making headlines in major financial media, there's no reason a court shouldn't accept it as a legitimate transfer of value, especially with your screenshot of the ad saying "I also accept bitcoins".

At this point, my thinking is that the bitcoin ecosystem needs investments in lots of startups to widen the scope and depth of the ecosystem. Investors tend to shy away from that kind of uncertainty, IME.
In contrast, the sharing of culture and knowledge is not an ecosystem that is dependent on anybody's going into it and growing it at this point. It has outlived the laws, made them irrelevant, and is pandering to a completely different-minded demographic.

Yes, it's important to note that I'm deliberately not taking a stand against the practices in the article - I just note that they're going on. I expressly note that a lot of bitcoin enthusiasts see the ability to behave like this as a strong _feature_ of bitcoin.
The next questions would be if the action should be illegal, whether you can enforce such a law, how, and if you can, whether you should.

I'm fine, thanks for asking. Did a bit of daytrading and lost a ton of money trying to figure out how market mechanics work, but overall, I've got about two-thirds of my original bitcoin position intact.
It would be fair to say I'm doing well. And just for the record, I haven't paid back the loan or credit yet. The interest on bitcoin is higher than what I'm paying on those. :)
It's a very weird feeling to wake up realizing you've lost 200k overnight, then regained 100k by breakfast, and trying not to freak out. I haven't quite come to grips with the fact that this is actually real money yet; I'm still struggling to make ends meet on some months in my regular, ordinary cashflow.
The real disconnect for me, I think, is that I tend to think of bitcoin like I think of WoW gold or EVE ISK. It's numbers on a screen that I can move around a bit. It's hard to connect the numbers you're looking at to the potential they have to change your actual lifestyle (and that they're not just for buying another epic set of armor like every other such number I've had up on screen).

No such luck, I'm afraid; I did not sell at $30 like you claim. If I had done so, I would be financially independent now. I did sell at $7 on the way down, but actually bought an additional large position at $31. It was only recently that it came into profit.
I did try daytrading, but let's just say I wasn't very good at it. :)

No, not all of it since that moment. I haven't used Buy &amp; Hold. I'm trying to trade and, frankly, I'm doing a terrible job at it. Had I just stashed the initial coins away, I'd have been much better off today.
Hence "out of position at the moment". Doesn't mean I left the concept. Means I'm trying to catch the swings. Failing badly. :)
Still, it's no exaggeration that my initial investment has done very well, despite those... shortcomings. I've seen the rumor that I exited at 32 in 2011, and that's false. Actually, I went in with considerably more at 31, having received additional credit. That hurt way until 2013.

M5s appears to take some ideas from the pirate movement, and has achieved a lot by combining it with strong leadership (which I advocate, but that some pirates are reluctant to use: there are risks with it too). Arguably, Grillo had a head start by having fame at the get-go, which I didn't.
