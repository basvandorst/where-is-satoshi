I don't think that's it (the lag party, anyway.. they are definitely trying to induce price movement)
These kind of bogus orders happen on real financial exchanges all the time. The purpose is to juke the charts and confuse other bots / traders.
For every 1 person actually watching the order book, there are 50-100 people who only see the "last sale" price. This is just a cheap way to manipulate that figure by taking advantage of the spread.

Are you a shady get-rich-quick huckster with no useful skills who wants to jump on the latest bandwagon and find someone else to do all the work for you while you put in nothing in return?

Keep hearing this sentiment and it's wrong.
If anything was going to kill the Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, it was the debacle in summer '11. I am still surprised they survived that, but here we are.
Tradehill was the "serious" exchange with wealthy financial industry backers who were supposed to step in and take over from the amateurs at mt.gox. That didn't work out, because it turns out running a bitcoin exchange is *pretty fucking hard*.
Mt.Gox now has a 2 year lead on any other startups. They effectively *are* bitcoin until a major brokerage picks it up, assuming that ever happens, which is a huge assumption. 
A "decentralized peer-to-peer" exchange, as I have seen suggested, is total nonsense.

The rumors of OP being a faggot are true
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:25:31
The entire bitcoin network can only handle 4-5000 transactions per second.
Why exactly is this "freaking pathetic"?
Wait, wait, don't tell me. Because you have no idea what you are talking about.

@_date: 2013-04-13 21:14:45
Nope, there are only so many bitcoins that will ever be mined so the price can only ever go up. That's just science, bro.
Any deviation from that rule is because of mtgox/ddos/conspiracy theories.

I think right now mt gox is only allowing you to get 50% profit but they were talking about increasing that.
I'm not sure about the particulars, I'm still reading Teach Yourself Python in 45 Minutes and I haven't gotten that far yet, but I'm sure it's coming up. I'll post back here when I know.

Yes, there is a python function for this. Just input how many percentages of profit you want and kick back and let the machine do all the work.

@_date: 2013-04-13 20:17:36
Yes take the risk and go for it.
I would go ahead and bid ~150,000 USD for the lot. That will be a bargain by the time the auction ends and you don't want to get priced out forever. If you don't have that much fiat right now you can sign up for some extra credit cards to pay thru paypal.
You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
