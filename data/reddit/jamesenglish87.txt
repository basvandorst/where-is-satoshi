Well yeah, hodling tends to be safer if you expect higher highs long term. But selling a portion of your portfolio when there are strong bear flags and then rebuying at the dip once bullish indicators appear is more profitable. Don't be a HODL elitist - selling at peaks and rebuying at dips will make you more money IF you know what you're doing.

If the fees you pay are higher than the gains you make from selling at peaks and buying at dips, I assume you're either using Coinbase with their exorbitant fees, or your technical analysis is flawed and therefore you are incorrectly calling highs and lows.

Lol. You sound like the people that said it was a bubble that was going to burst soon back when it was worth hundreds per coin. RIP

Use Gemini. 0.25% fees vs coinbase 1.49%. I bought $1000 worth a couple days ago and there was a $2.50 fee.

Really? What bank do you use?
I use Bank of America and all I had to do to transfer funds was verify my identity with pictures of my drivers license, which I assume you did. After that all I had to do was enter my bank info in to the exchange (account and routing number etc) and I could withdraw after that. Never had to go to the bank.

Both. Look at the recent trends, bitcoin has been steadily increasing for...well just about forever. And it’s growing faster and faster.
By the time the fork is here, bitcoin’s price will most likely be well over 8k. Even if it does dip after the fork, I doubt it will dip down to the current price. 
Plus, if you buy some bitcoin now and keep your coins on coinbase, you’ll be credited with an equal amount of b2x after, which you can sell right away and use to buy more bitcoin.
