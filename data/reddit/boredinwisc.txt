Can anyone give me a really quick rundown on how this whole thing works?  I downloaded a wallet and now have no idea what to do from here...

Wait staff in the U.S. (for the most part) don't want to do away with our tipping culture.  They (again, for the most part) make more money that way than if you paid them a "proper wage".  It may not be your way, but it doesn't make it wrong.

But that has to do with the general etiquette in the U.S. of tipping servers.  The status quo extends into areas where they are getting a higher base pay and getting the benefit of people who were raised knowing that servers don't get paid minimum wage.  If the U.S. changed Federal Employment Law to make it universal, tipping would reduce, especially as prices rose.

I see.  Thank you. Follow up: I wasn't aware there were more than one of these currencies happening. What distinguishes BitCoin or is it simply name recognition at this point?

Okay (and I really do apologize for continuing to ask questions and if answers stop coming, I understand, but I'm a neophyte) What just happened with China to collapse the market? They were accepting it but then denounced it?

Awesome thanks! How international is it at this point? Are there many places accepting it?

Interesting. Is it based (at this point) upon the global currency backing it or is it more a full faith and credit idea dictating it's value? I'm sure it's some combination, just wondering which is more prevalent.

Fair enough. Thank you for all of the information.

That's phenomenal and all, but the idea that California is any indicator of the rest of the country is laughable.  Also, not everyone in California is a native Californian.  I've lived in several states, but learned about staff wages growing up.  I will go out on a limb and say that people NOT from California (as well as lots from California) who are aware that there is life outside that state and are familiar with the low wages of food service, if for no other reason than the movie ["Resevoir Dogs"](

Okay. I am also to understand that it can be used as general currency with those retailers who accept it, but is it also being used as stock? How would one sell it back on the open market.  Sorry if these are well known things, I'm just coming in to this.
