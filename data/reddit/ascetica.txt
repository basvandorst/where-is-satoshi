You went from 'everyone' to 'some of them'. Can I get 'a few people'?

It's not about stock losing value, but about companies that would pop up overnight offering the world and then disappearing in an instant. There are a lot of start ups getting into the bitcoin space without much of a plan, much like the dot com boom.

Not sure if this has already been posted,  but there's a [much better article]( discussing who Satoshi probably is from the New Yorker back in 2011.

Laughed when I read about sounding like an Ayn Rand character.  I was thinking the same thing.

My friend texted me this video yesterday for completely unrelated reasons and now it's on The planets have aligned!

All you people defending journalists for just doing their jobs are idiots. They print what makes money and that hurts whatever community they're exploiting for the week. They don't need help in "doing their jobs," thanks.

I'd think that some people, especially someone like Satoshi,  would be content with cashing out a few million and sitting and watching their legacy grow in anonymity and comfort. Maybe he (or the group of people who represent his name) is happy to live a simple life continuing doing whatever he was doing before creating bitcoin.

Yeah, I read that after in their FAQ. Now I don't know where my extra bitcoins came from!

That's troubling to hear. Thanks for the info.
