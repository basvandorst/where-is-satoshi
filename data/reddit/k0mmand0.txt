Other than the fact that bitcoins is a currency, and gold is money. A currency's only value is to be traded upon and being deflationary causes people not to trade it.
There isn't much difference between a fiat currency that is heavily inflated versus another fiat currency that is heavily deflated as both are just as bad.

The more the value goes up the less it gets traded and the more people want to buy in to hoard them to get rich, not to use them in trading.
[And a large chunk of bitcoins released haven't been used once. 65% in fact as of last month. And of those that have been used, about 60% has been used on a gambling site.](

It can't be forged is debatable, as for gamed, that's happening all the time. Why do you always read articles about one of the few getting rich off of bitcoins, but not of the many who have lost their shirts? Hell, all the "to the moon" posts are manipulating people into buying in, which in turns makes their coins go up in value. It's easily gamed.


People like banks and governments. Makes things stable. They can also regulate and control things. If your bank steals your money, you can sue them. If a bitcoin exchange "looses" your money who are you going to call up?


Very few for both and that is a shame.


It's all subjective.


Used to money was something that had value and a currency just represented money. That's how it's supposed to be. Now people use them interchangeable because they don't know the difference; they've never used real money

Which almost no one does because bitcoin is deflationary. Actually, all of these crypto-currencies are. That is their biggest flaw. [65% of released bitcoins haven't even been used once.](
Don't get me wrong, I actually do think these crypto-currencies have a future, but these faults will have to be fixed first.

Bitcoins isn't money, it's a fiat currency. Money has real world value outside of a medium of exchange, a currency does not. A currency's only value is to be traded and if it's not traded it ceases to be a currency and the value plummets.
We had a problem in the 50s where people were not trading their silver certificates because the dollar has been inflated to the point that the value of a silver dollar was worth more than a dollar. So whenever someone got a silver certificate they would go straight to the bank and trade it for a silver dollar, which would be worth about $1.20.

I have a trusted way of making sure the data on a hard drive isn't recoverable.

Yes. I believe half the shots were from a Swiss K-31 (7.5x55) and the others were from a Lee-Enfield or Type 99 Arisaka (I don't remember which, both have same diameter bullets though).

That's not a value, that's more of a perk. It does not have a very high security either as the transactions are easily traceable. 


It's nice to have something hard backing what you're using in trade. Even if the country that minted that coin is no more, the metals it's minted in still has value that makes it easier for someone to take it in payment. Money and currencies are only good if people accept it. A piece of paper is just a piece of paper, but that gold is gold.


That's one definition of fiat. The one I am using is that it has no intrinsic value. I also said currency, not money. They are not really interchangeable as people think.
