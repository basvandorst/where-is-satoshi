I only spent a small portion of my money on the etf that trades crypto. I doubt this crypto thing will go for long term. There’s a reason ppl abandoned the gold standard (commodity based currency)

Decentralized ledger is too slow for full adoption. 15 min per transaction is insane to be feasible. Also, why would the mega riches want their own “asset become worthless while some kid who holds some virtual currency has all the purchasing power”. Anyways I put 10% of my portfolio in super speculative investment so I bought an etf that trades crypto. We work with rich ppl and I can tell you, they don’t lose money..

A lot of it is rather conspiracy theory type of statement .. :s

I never put my money in cash. I graduated in 2009 when the real estate crashed. I’ve been putting my saving (other than the registered retirement fund) in real estate. So far I bought 4 condos/town. And I’ll just buy more in the future. Sure if I bought bitcoin I’d have retired by now. My logic is simple. No matter what currency (usd or bc), livable space will always be desired. That’s why I only invest in central location in the bigggest city in my country. But bc is def a good way to get rich fast but it ain’t for all of us.

My frd at the bank was actually part of the team studying it for practical use few years ago. Not the coin part cause it’s not that unique. It’s the decentralized database which caught their attention. They wanted to do decentralized general ledger and contract but they had to abandon because of individual storage is not big and internet not fast enough

So you basically telling me you have no idea how it’s valued...

I guess it’ll be a medium of exchange for a certain segment of ppl. Ppl still use gold at certain places. In the foreseeable future it’ll not replace the currency we use. The fluctuation is just too much 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:56:23
Nothing... it’s a medium of exchange that’s why it’s not “valued” per se. however BC is always expressed in term of other currency that’s why I am asking 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:57:31
What about 20 other coins on the market plus 2000 more types on the way. How are we going to value it 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:28:11
Diamond is not rare.... gold is much more rare than diamond. Diamond’s supply is heavily manipulated by few big players. You think it’ll be the same for BC?
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:08:24
So it’s not a currency it’s commodity then... it’s much less stable then gold for sure.. 30% volatility is def a problem for it to have any practical value. But it’s a great opportunity for big babks to get in a make lots of money since the market is unregulated. My gf’s firm actually did a study on it couple years ago but abandoned the idea. Let’s see if other financial institutions will jump in since the market cap is quite large at the moment

How would bc sold that? It fluctuate 10% a day..
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:14:42
What’s wrong with current money? It’s pretty much virtual anyways. Why do I need to current my usd to a coin then pay it?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:56:59
Why should anyone care? It’s quite useless from what I’ve read.. it fluctuate too much to be a viable currency. And it’s not readily available to use as a method of payment. I better off sticking with putting money in real property in big city

Bank makes so little money on retail banking. It’s more for exposure and presence.. source: I audited bank

？when did I say I am an expert.. dude, chill out. It’s just investment. I lost 10k on the stock yesterday, I am not going around bashing other ppll
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:55:54
I see.. what about other coins? Do they all have 21mil as finite number?
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:58:15
Do not panic! I repeat do not panic. Hold guys. Bit coin will prevail
(Disclosure: I have no position in BC)
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:07:14
Nice. Ask if anyone will sell their home for your BC. For something to be currency. It has to be be accepted. I only bought 2000 worth of some etf that contains crypto crap. It has gone down a lot but hey, it’s fun. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:12:16
So bc is moral? Creating wealth out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:15:15
21mil usd? That’s awesome 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:56:11
So creating a currency? 50% fluctuation is not a currency 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:12:20
Cause everyone is talking about it? I am here to read up like gossip magazines 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:58:52
Medium of exchange? Have you bought anything using bc?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:10:12
I am pretty old school. Hey, ppl will always need a place to live. I live in Toronto. My parents started buying when we moved here 20 years ago. Now they got 6 all rental and I got 3 more with my wife. House went up 5 multiple in 20 years. Nothing crazy like bc but the rent covers itself. No matter how technology advance, ppl gotta have a place to live right?
