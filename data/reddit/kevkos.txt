This is what Coinbase charges. Are you suggesting this is high?
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:14:55
BTC2MUN! Where are the trolls now? Since everyone reacts so insanely to any short term price drops (i.e. "Bitcoin is dead and you guys are all fools!"), we all need to go crazy with this spike (i.e. "Bitcoin is bigger than the internet itself and will be worth 1 million per coin soon get in now or you're an idiot!")

I was at a Bitcoin conference in Dec 2013 and one speaker predicted $5000 by March. Even at the time, with all the irrational exuberance, we thought that sounded pretty looney tunes.

Just bought 4.7 BTC @ 210. BTC2MOON!
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:04:04
Nice! You're doing well. Inspired me, I'm buying 5 BTC right now @ 197.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:20:06
Um...and how exactly are they going to tax all these addresses? Spend endless time tracking every single transaction to someone? Impossible!
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:34:55
Actually it just showed a major sign, up 10% in the last hour.
@_date: 2015-01-20 20:32:36
Why would anyone vote this down? It's not controversial. I was just pointing out what happens every time we have good news. The price isn't affected, whereas, in 2013 far less important news would send the price up  $50-100!
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:04:38
Suddenly, everyone seems to be a fortune teller.

Interesting. Thanks for all the info! Last time I was in Prague in 2005, the locals did not know much English at all...happy to find out this is changing.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:52:44
Time to dollar cost average.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:04:28
And that is?
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:59:58
Uhh, you need to keep up, not dropping like a rock. Went from 169 to now 207 since this afternoon. Nobody knows which way it's headed next.
@_date: 2015-01-25 02:52:33
This is because the price has been going up since it bottomed around 170. The next time the price drops the Tulip Trolls will re-emerge like clockwork.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:54:06
PEOPLE! Ever heard of dollar cost averaging? I bought on the way up and buying on the way down. No one can predict the future or "call the top" or "call the bottom". Just do what works unless you suddenly don't believe in the technology, which is just  asinine.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:37:01
Huge news! Aaaand in a typical bitcoin response, the price dropped 50 cents. :(
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:16:17
Yep. Goes both ways though. Every time the price drops, people come out of the woodworks to proclaim bitcoin's death, and how everyone involved is a complete delusional idiot. Until the next upturn in the price when all those people disappear and don't say a word.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:44:38
How do we know buying back in in 2014 is a bad call? For today's price, it is, but are we sure he wanted to sell in 6 months? I bet by the summer we will be back over the 500 and maybe even 1000, and his buy at those levels will be just fine.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:03:10
If it was said on Yahoo Finance...it must be the troof.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:18:46
Did you see the prices he paid? He's up, no reason to think he's losing it.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:19:29
Why? If BTC went from $80 to $218, would you make this claim?
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:34:01
Andreas makes a great point here. 24 hours is a ridiculous time to judge the value of anything, but if you're going to do that, compare apples to apples.
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:45:21
Banking and government are in bed together. More regulations for banks just means cozier relationships with politicians. So my point was that yes they are highly regulated by the government, and no this does not mean they are less likely to do crazy shit (like steal money from people's accounts, happens all the time in our current, highly regulated system).
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:59:30
Yes! Just just protective gloves. :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:01:46
Banking is the most regulated industry in America.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:12:55
He's actually up quite a bit at this point.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:32:31
The people who bought after the news already hit. Those who wait for the event to happen lose, the price is already built in.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:09:45
I hope he does spend some time on the price. While the price isn't EVERYTHING about bitcoin, it's more important than many would have you think.
@_date: 2015-04-28 02:42:34
OK Cupid admits to spying on their members and reading their emails. Not a cool company at all, now this.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:26:21
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:53:11
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:04:50
^^Exactly. This isn't a political campaign. "Getting people" to accept bitcoin is pretty pointless. So they agree to it and understand it and get all set up and then 0/100 customers request to pay using it. Waste of time, I like your idea of starting with Square or Stripe which are still relatively new technologies.
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:37:01
I think it goes first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:52:24
BOOM! 
BCT 2 munz!!!!
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:04:58
Well that was true that year until it wasn't.
Just like the trolls were right this year, until they weren't.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:56:23
It will never go that low again. The technicals show a huge floor at 240. If we make it over 300 for a few days....moon is next.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:34:10
Haha yeah good point. The stuff I'm following seems pretty accurate though. I think $240 was a huge mountain to stay ahead of. It may go back to that, but I doubt it will go lower. Of course, no one can really predict what will happen and in Dec 2013 many "experts" were saying $5k within 3 months!
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:30:50
Nevermind, I was thinking you said IRA not 401k.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:01:43
"Backed by incompetence"

I'll settle for a rocket-powered elevator.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:50:49
First, they laugh at you...
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:05:48
The moon is still a more likely scenario than zero as the trolls have predicted all along.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:27:10
Completely not true.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:01:09
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:30:10
You can easily sign up for a self-directed IRA and do it that way.
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:03:52
He included "governments" when he mentioned "force for good". See any problems there?
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:54:29
Instead of calling me names...maybe explain how banks now control the price of btc.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:33:10
Can you explain this more? I thought Antonopoulous destroyed this idea a while ago.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:33:11
How will they catch you if you don't pay double?
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:53:38
It is anonymous. Just use local bitcoins, or even better, go to a local bitcoin meetup and trade with actual real people that buy and sell BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:31:19
When the internet was 6 years old...it would be 20 years before any sort of mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:42:36
What? What happened???
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:40:46
I'm a fan of bitcoin but I'm growing really tired of everyone saying "2 years away" and "the price doesn't matter". It's annoying so stop it.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:01:29
Funny I totally agree with what you said. T-Mobile has time and time again proven themselves to be the most progressive and friendly company of the big telecoms. I too love their customer service. My ONE complaint is sometimes even in metro areas I get 0 bars, but no idea of that's the same with Verizon, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:29:56
True. Surprises me that the price isn't reflecting this sentiment. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 03:03:35
Hence, meeting real people in person and setting up a network of traders is better than any other option.
