In light of [recent]( events, we can't trust our previous judgment on website access alone. MiTM attacks could have been successful  in your case :(

Hi Mark.  You're the good guy here.

Agreed. The voice acting could have been done better though. I always hear the bunny say "Could you rape me, please?" to the end of the clip..

I'm looking at my magic 8 ball. It says that BTC China recently announced "LB killer app" (no multisign feature of course), will be another escrow victim of a similar attack. Of course the majority in this community joins the awesom-o cheerleader-train until then. Naivity is big with this one...

Now you can turn all W. White and create a BTC trade scam for Becks' viewership

As long as the mining process relies solely on CS technology big players will always be able to run the show. I hope someone will develop a Q&amp;A human-friendly reward mining system (humancoin?) which will be more difficult to be solved by a CS system than a human being.

Alice sends Bob 20 bits. Alice, like... Alice in Wonderland. Get it? This vid goes deep (into archetypal territory).

RippleLabs are storing their wallet blobs on Payward Inc. servers FWIW

Don't get me wrong, but I much rather want to hear this enthusiasm from our fellow Millennials when Bitcoin is not constantly on the news radar. If Bitcoin can overcome the brutally small attention span of teenagers these days, like the Internet for my generation accomplished, I will be impressed. Until then I have my reservations.

If you haven't already, you should contact the  [president]( of the recently founded Swiss Bitcoin Association. This guy is a maker (main technical drive behind secure cloud storage Wuala), has worked as CTO for a big tech (LaCie) and he's a long-time Bitcoin holder. Plus he lives in Zurich :)
