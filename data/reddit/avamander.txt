You're extrapolating, noone has said anything about kevlar-laminated paper wallets, just how to actually benefit from 2FA. He just said 2FA is meant to reduce the risk of anyone stealing your pw and your coins, if you keep your two keys in the same place it's no longer 2FA. It's not a disagreement, you're just wrong and noone is insulting you or anything, it's just that you're wrong, if you take that as "unfriendly" it's quite frankly your problem.

As told before by others use a Ubuntu Linux live USB stick if you ever are going to mount it, have a larger than the found drive in the system that has a clean partition or you're willing to overwrite fully and then just clone it, after that you can do whatever you wish with the created image without having to worry about ruining the drive.
You can use something like:
     sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=64K conv=noerror,sync
in command line, just make sure you get the disk names correct (sdX is source, sdY is destination you can use any tool you wish to get the correct name of your disk).
