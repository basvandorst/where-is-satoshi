If you have your private keys, you actually have BOTH Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. When they forked, the each kept the chain history.
Look up a guide on how to split your coins.

It's a win-win on first glance, but in application:
Lose for company: The most qualified applicants are not sitting at home with spare time. They are working, studying, or involved in other things. They already have a portfolio of past and current work, why force them to look at something they have to make specifically for the company's HR department to look at.
Lose for applicant: The more time you spend, the more likely you are to get the position, but the more likely you are to waste more time. The best possibly play is to probably spend very little time and have a very small chance at the job, than improve the odds by a small amount but risk the extra commitment. Also getting shafted by not being able to enter past work into the equation. It only makes sense to apply if you have a work product from your past that applies to the question and can be submitted. (E.g. people who already blog about bitcoin probably have something to submit.)
Solution: This should be step two of the hiring process. You don't want to scare applicants away, you want as many as possible. Then make them do something that can allow the diamonds in the rough to float to the top.

If you're using the classic adoption curve, if you buy *today* you're an early adopter. The next step is making the jump to the early majority, which is when a tech can be considered to have "made it." It's the toughest jump, and we're not there yet.

Sure, but small spending amounts make sense to host somewhere that offers good ease of use and special features. So I'm asking for direction on those services.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:15:54
I'm confused. Why are goods involved? Why not just run a simple multi-sig transaction between the two parties and Brawker as an arbitrator?

I bought and held some bitcoin for a while now, but with more and more merchants accepting it, I want to use my account more often. I'm a bit under-educated when it comes to services such as Coinkite. After checking out their website, the service looks pretty nice. However, I wanted to ask here whether this seems to be among the best-of-the-best, or whether it's missing features that I don't know about that are available elsewhere. Help me decide where to host my active coins!
EDIT: Got a downvote right away. If that means there's a good resource I should check out rather than asking here, please direct me to it.

Little vent as a current job seeker: HSBC must get hundreds of applicants for a position like this. How much time must be invested to write a quality paper, much less the best of the 100+ applicant pool, for a tiny shot at earning the position? I get the weeding out aspect, but this just doesn't make sense from an applicant's perspective unless you've already written a paper for other reasons.

You're still missing my point. Do you agree there's a need for such a thing as exchanging fiat for bitcoin? Shouldn't a service that does this do it as easily and painless as possible? This service, for some reason, adds a weird step of buying a product. Why?
Fiat IS a superior form of money if you're buying something from someone who doesn't accept bitcoin. I'm not sure why that matters here. I'm trying to figure out why I should use this exchange.
@_date: 2014-10-21 14:13:49
Use the coins and immediately buy more to replace them
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:23:14
I also don't understand the CC issue. How does anyone use a CC ever? The idea of chargebacks exists no matter what you purchase, not just bitcoins.
And why is it easier to prove you purchased headphones than it is bitcoins? Bitcoin is a public ledger, proof of transfer takes two clicks.

How does one "get your money out" of a company that just filed for bankruptcy anyway? You can't withdraw funds that don't exist, and if they did, would be frozen during bankruptcy proceedings. And bad news, debtors are getting paid first - you're last on the totem pole.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:34:30
What? That's not my question at all. This service is purporting to be an exchange - facilitating one person's purchase of bitcoin for fiat. In there example, why the hell are we bringing headphones into it?
If I want to buy headphones with bitcoin, I have to post to this site and wait around for someone to buy it for me? And they get my coins? Why don't they just give me cash and I'll buy the headphones (assuming the merchant doesn't accept bitcoin outright, of course)?

It would still be after the bankruptcy, which would automatically put a halt on withdrawals. He could mean to sell your shares of Bitcoin, but if those existed and that phrase made any sense, after filing for bankruptcy the value of the shares would plummet instantly and be practically worthless.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:41:30
I think this service is a step towards that
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:27:33
Exactly, everyone is overreacting. Also, there's an exemption for:
"(e) An entity licensed as a money transmitter under the Money Transmission Act;"
Which is most virtual currency businesses anyway.

I work at the center and will be live tweeting the event  I'll see if we can't get video uploaded as well.
EDIT: Also, if anyone's in New York, come on down! 7p, open bar, why not? 40 Broad Street.

This is a dumb question, but I never understood how you can buy something anonymously online. How does the seller send the item to the buyer without any identifying information?
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:37:16
The Center actually had issues with regulations, which led to its undeveloped state since it's opening a little over a year ago. The people there are still working to make something out of it though.
Overstock gave a presentation to a crowd of about 60 earlier tonight on their Medici project, so it is definitely alive and well.

The US government will claim jurisdiction over a miner's activity if he so much as got electricity from an American power plant, or made a phone call over American phone lines.

All transfers are recorded on the blockchain. Coinbase will also track all transfers related to your account.
Bitcoin isn't anonymous.

Actually yeah. I agree. The product is minimalist, the font should be minimalist. It puts out a cool, edgy vibe, but it also makes me feel like it's introducing a toy or a media product, not a reliable hardware device.

This is a cherrypicked photo. It's near the end of the final day. It has been quite full for much of the conference

Unfortunately I think I remember their compliance guy telling me they don't want to associate with the marijuana industry yet. It would be worth a follow up though if anyone in a position to use the service is reading this.

Bitreserve's business model doesn't depend on bitcoin being the dominant digital currency. It just needs one. I don't see how these statements are a contradiction, unless you don't understand the point of Bitreserve.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:01:04
One currency's upturn is another currency's downturn.
BitReserve is designed for people who want to use the bitcoin rails, but don't want bitcoin. My $100 worth of bitcoin, if held in dollars on my account, is worth 100 USD regardless of what happens to the bitcoin price. Yet I can send these dollars to anyone as bitcoin whenever I want.
No, it doesn't sound like that's for you. For others, this is the first step toward getting people such as merchants to accept bitcoin while avoiding the volatility risk *entirely*.

Wasn't the founder also in charge of the firm that gave 21 the millions in funds that hyped it up? The company never seemed "right" to me, haven't shown otherwise yet.
