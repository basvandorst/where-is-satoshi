Thank you for reading between the lines. I meant THE shit as in, turned around for better @ downvoters. If anything it helped btc grow because who was buying in at 15-19.7k lol

Can’t blockchain be compromised? Lots of dirty users from the past from the dark markets.

Paying on a car loan with debits (cash or actual paid debit $) is what you are *supposed* to do...You are paying the bank. Paying back a loan with disproportionate gains/losses arises many issues with reporting income and overall assets. 
It is not a great idea to buy stocks or bitcoin out of loan funds. Calculative risk involved in it. However buying quality stocks might results in some amount of gains.
Aside from Suppose if you are applying for personal/Mortgage loan ,no financial institution is going to provide loan for a rate less than 14 percent apr . First of all, financial institution will look into the source of income and other collateral security for repayment loan . After looking into these consideration then only it will lend money on repayment capacity
With these parameters if you invest your loan funds into equity, there is no guarantee that you will earn profits always. Your's return from investment should be more than the interest charged on your loan. One most important thing which usually were not considered while investing in any investment is Cost of inflation!!
Yes, Cost of inflation should be considered if you really want to know whether portfolio has paid off or not.
Take an example
“Mr. A” borrows Rs. 1,00,000 from a bank  percent . He invests it in equity,say in diversified sector . At the end of the year he sells it @ handful overall return of 20 percent (T&amp;C)
Annual inflow :Rs. 20,000
Yearly interest payout : Rs.14,000 + Rs. 500 bank charges (Under simple interest,if you are repaying it in monthly installment it may come down and bank follows compound interest method)
Gain : 5500.
Since you lucked out and didn’t have to bite the bullet, I advise you to never try this again with bitcoin and rather something more stable and less volatile. I suggest to invest savings into equity or mutual funds which is the safest bet.
If you have loan funds, or profit from investing with loans then start a business because you will get farther, much faster and be able to buy btc with capitalized gains.
Edit: Take what I said about mortgage and APR, now couple that with high payments of interest, exchange fees and possible risk of volatility. Financial disaster waiting to happen.
Poor investing leverage is a fantastic way to lose money.

I go to USF and I saw this motherfucker walk into the Hilton hotel on campus before the basketball game and I was in awe.

He’s just one of those asses that have to get personal to try to make himself feel better. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 13:53:54
You’re dumb. Please never do that again because that’s terrible financial advice, you just lucked out,

Is it???

Maybe he has a more expensive car
Tesla’s are junk. The model 2 is about as “decent” of a rip off you can get for 80k.
@_date: 2019-02-20 16:10:22
No, sorry for the confusion I am referring to the Model S. Some of my buddies work there in the service center and call it the 2.
I drive them daily as a rental for my company if you were wondering.
Love when people can’t even notice that typing in Tesla model ( will you give the corresponding car.
