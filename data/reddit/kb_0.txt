I like the idea, but I also have a few concerns.
* Every site owner would have to setup an account/ID for the BitCoin management. Many, many webmaster may not know about the program, those who know may not give a damn about it, and some may try to exploit it for their own gain.
* The potential risk for abuse is low if we're dealing with micro amounts, but it's still a possibility. Hell, if I had my own personal site set up with this theoretical API, even I might try writing a script to go through different IP addresses (proxies/VPNs/zombies) with different usernames to upvote different postings of my site. Really, just to see if I could accomplish such a thing. But if I would do it out of curiosity, someone else may do it with the intent of personal gain. And there's one more thing that comes to mind.
* How would this nano-sized currency be donated? By which I mean, would it come from the upvoter or would it be donated from the origin (BitCoin, which creates the coinage out of thin air). If it's the upvoter who donates, the API would have to be able to ask for or store (or perhaps even look-up from a database) the BitCoin ID of the upvoter. This isn't impossible, but it would take quite a bit of time to develop, test, and deploy. The increase in hassle would fight of the minuscule potential for abuse and it would also prevent unnecessary inflation. Speaking of which, if the nano BitCoin donation came directly BitCoin (as an award without a donor, basically) then it would slowly but surely increase the rate of inflation even more. And in the worse case scenario, if people start abusing it with scripts, more and more grows the inflation. **But..** That's only if the creators and managing coders of BitCoin would decide to get involved in such a venture. ;)
So those are the thoughts that flew threw my head after I calmed down from the initial excitement. I'm sure there's a way to establish something like this in the future, but it will take time, a ton of thought, and a lot of cooperation.
Thanks for giving me something to think about :)
