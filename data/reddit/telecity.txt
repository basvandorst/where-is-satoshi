no matter what you say - libertymark is already synonymous w/ a troll. fact.
oh, great, now his sidekick turned up aswell
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:04:53
forget this lousy attempt.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:51:39
the source said.. "lost fath".. hahaha.. come on. smells of bullshit from miles away
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:52:12
how are those bitcoins bought in the first place then? miners usually sell, they don't "shop" w/ their BTC on a regular basis
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:40:42
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:59:08
HAHAHA, BUSTED!
well, the OP gave himself away by default anyway when he had an attention grabbing title and some pretentious text hacked together as threads body - claims the sky is falling and then retracts with o, what's happening atm? i've been out
work on your presentation next time.

even your reply is only theoretical. the chart might play out, but it is a complete simplification in regards to bitcoin, because its limited, abstract model does not take any factors into consideration that are essential to the bitcoin economy when you're "predicting".. you just try to speculate based on stretching this very model.. the only problem is that bitcoin is a lot more bigger than your understanding of it; "big corporations"? who? eBay? I really can't see anyone thinking clearly here cherishing the idea that eBay would drop paypal and go the bitcoin way instead (customer protection?).. anyway, why would those corporations even make a "statement"? they are not inclined to. bad PR has been coming out on all fronts for BTC - and.. ? nothing. businesses are developing and gaining popularity. your definition of "crash" is also quite loose and open to interpretation. so far it's only nitpicking.

кажись, подсаднаэ уткэ. 
про 450 - ололо. с чего, вдруг, хомяки то не захомячат опять, мм? давать такие прогнозы - пустой звон. ну да, киты могут слить - только далеко не все состоят в этом "сообществе" и далеко не все имеют одинаковую стратегию. так что - просим пруф.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:43:42
and we have the same amount of global exposure as before? please. your predictions are flawed at best
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:47:48
too bad bro, too bad
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:04:12
if you're not going to give the .dat file - then what are you going to provide?

@_date: 2013-12-14 19:51:21
pardon my ignorance - but what are you referring to in particular here? as in, what did bobby lee say that this article exposed as "not true"?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:03:29
the question is not what to do - but why this has happened.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:39:13
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:59:42
it's just hilarious how full of shit you are
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:12:22
honestly, I don't see a problem with btc-qt either
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:24:02
it was obvious from the very start, but - EXPOSED
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:39:46
you mean - made a good chunk of money.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:38:41
I agree.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:04:00
ну вот, как я и предполагал - мудила )
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:44:53
already verified as fake.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:23:56
pfahahaha.. moron. this is 100% fake. I especially fucking lold at the "explains the price dip".
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:30:12
So you're saying that "those in power" have pulled their strings and are the masterminds behind the corrupt (I don't believe in such coincidences, so I would have to use the term "obviously") bad PR? I am also under the same impression. However, this has really gotten widespread coverage. Almost every "western" article I read - is currently trashing bitcoin, FOR SOME reason. I just wonder if they are really THAT effective in coordinating their actions, I mean you'd have to put pressure at the same points at the same time.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:43:43
who said anything about shares? looney bin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:12:07
pretty crappy article, this doesn't say anything new than what we already know.. except it also tries to ignite artificial hysteria with an attention-grabbing subject that hasn't even become any more different since the US hearings.. CRAP.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:16:21
oh, it's this bitch libertymark.. ignore, the troll just doesn't give up.. the only thing he does is post discredit-type propaganda.. he already made prognosis several times for eminent crash (which didn't happen).. pure spam, ignore
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:39:01
каким образом инсайдерская инфа может настолько точно курс определять? боты будут держать? с трудом верится.
по поводу "b???.vs" - если там все 112 человек, то фигли ты криптишь название? как-то очень нелепо - что это даёт?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:34:20
ye. cracked me up when I saw it as well.. the whole translation was a fucking circus trick anyway
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:34:32
да я то подожду.. в фиате :trlf: 
вообще то неделя уже наступила.. ты на кой закриптил название этого иннерсёркл?
и опять же - с какой радости именно 450? очень опрометчиво было сказанно
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:22:46
where you hear that? any links?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:22:08
what a FUD spreading dumbface. obviously has no prior knowledge of bitcoin fluctuating and even about the existence of the term 'dump'. knock yourself out, noob
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:02:38
Yes, indeed. But the fact that it emerged IN PLACE of the good news is very interesting. Instead of praising the committee hearing results - the press is TRASHING bitcoin. Either this is just a coincidence or.. actually I think not.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:47:25
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:15:23
oh and, during those hearings, they certainly didn't "scramble for norms" as much as they article tries to claim it.. pfft.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:20:35
only a theoretical assessment based on primitive calculations - a lot of factors are left out of the consideration, like the exposure level Bitcoin has received and actual value of the novel technology involved.. it's pretty hard to do objectively anyway, that's why I'm pretty sure you can't just generalize in the case of Bitcoin and make an accurate prediction
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:28:10
"Bitcoin exchanges like Mt.Gox have been hacked"
so DDoS is now a "hack"? omg the competence of people writing such articles..
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:57:10
lol'd, well played
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:56:57
this was.. odd.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:12:23
how are the proportions the same?
