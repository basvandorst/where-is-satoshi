Erik is right when he says that bankers are annoyed and embarrassed to have missed out on the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at $1, $5, or even $10...
But all of us at are also capable of ignoring problems with the bitcoin blockchain that 'trusted ledgers' fix... Mainly, 'instant' blocks (as soon as a trusted signer sees a tx they can publish a block), scalability (big banks can support 1000TB blockchains), and no wasteful PoW mining.
With a trusted ledger, the fees can permanently be $0.00, since there is practically no cost to verifying tx's.  And if any signer screws up, they're kicked out of the consortium.  They can also update functionality and include things like the ethereum virtual machine without having to go through the slow and impossible process of updating Bitcoin core code.
So... yeah, we can ignore 'trusted ledgers' as nonsense... but banks have the ability to deploy them to the wider public and have billions of users worldwide within 24 months if they found the will to do it.  Nothing technically stopping them.   Bitcoin adoption cycle is much more difficult.  
The good news for anyone worried about trusted ledgers is that they don't stop Bitcoin from acting as a 'digital reserve currency'.. the benchmark base that people use worldwide for currency exchange, just as gold used to be for thousands of years.   
I suspect in the future we will see a combination of both in the economy.

Bitcoin devs should take Ethereum seriously and start offering turing complete scripting.
