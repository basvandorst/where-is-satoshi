I was told about onecoin about 2 years ago, an irl friend told me that he had been making some € from it, and said that it was a new crypto currency.  
As soon as I got home, i started to search for it, thinking I would buy in (because i heard it was new, and he had already made a decent profit)  
Only to find out, that I could not find onecoin on any crypto trading sites, and on their homepage the only things you could buy was some starter packs, no exchanging of any crpto currency at all.  
All I could see was a poorly setup ponzi, and ever since that day, I've waited for it to burst, and telling evryone that has mentioned it not to buy in,/get out before it falls apart...  
But of course, to the people that already had bought in, and was making profit, I was a complete dumbass for missing out on a once in a lifetime thing, smh -.-

It took them 2 years to mine 2 billion coins, and the value of them went from 0,5€ to 6.95 within that time.  
Now, after October 1st, they mined 2bil coins (so everyone could get doubled coins, for whatever reason) and they're mining 50.000 every minute!  
They have also told us that the price of every onecoin will most likely be 25€ at the end of 2017. xD  
For every day that passes, Onecoins worth 500million€ are mined! And since Oncoin seems to think rules of math and market supply/demand and other stupid things don't apply to them, the coins that no1 can use, trade they are actually worth that ammount :P
