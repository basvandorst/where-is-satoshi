Block size limit increase, not the block size. For the block size to increase to 20MB there have to be transactions to fill it. And right now, there aren't . So, yes, if the block size limit increase now to 20MB, I would be able to continue running my full node. (10/2 Mbit/s flat rate internet right now, will be upgraded next year. for same price.)

'Only 8 connections' means that node only has outbound connections (8), connecting to other full nodes, but not receiving connections from clients.

If blockchain.info is showing 73 confirmations, you already got the coins, but you are using a full client as your wallet, it's not yet sync-ed with bitcoin blockchain, and thus can't display the new wallet balance to you.
No need to wait to sync (1 Year!), just export the private key from your full client, install a thin client (Electrum or Multibit) or open a blockchain.info wallet, and import the private key. The coins are waiting for you at your address!

With a bit of formatting:
On May 14, 2015, the best conference centre of the Czech capital "Praha" hosted Bitcoin Conference Prague, a unique profile event, where the future of cryptocurrency on the world market was discussed. The speakers were prominent Bitcoin enthusiasts from all over Eastern Europe, representatives of various companies successfully operating with this cryptocurrency. 
The Conference in Prague has significantly expanded its scale in comparison with the Bitcoin Conferences conducted in Kiev, Moscow and St. Petersburg. The event included the following sections:
* Bitcoin 2015: What to expect and what to fear?
* Blockchain: prospects for the future 
* Transactions with Bitcoin
* Regulation
* Bitcoin in gambling 
In addition, Bitcoin Conference Prague involved a unique exhibition area attended by representatives of various companies from the Czech Republic, Russia, Armenia, Poland, Italy and other countries: * Bit-X; • Gokillo; • BitStamp; • MoneyPolo; • General Bytes; • CoinFox; • BW; • BitMarket; • BitStock; • BitBay; • Cryptosteel; • Bitnik; • BetConstract; • GeoBit; • Confirmo; • Endorphina. 
An exciting Start-up Alley did not remain without attention of guests. There you could find the most unusual solutions for work with cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin Conference Prague was really a unique specialized event where you could socialize with experienced representatives of the Bitcoin community, buy or convert Bitcoins into cash through a General Bytes' machine. After the official part of the event, we held an unusual after-party, sponsored by MoneyPolo. Informal communication with colleagues, beer, traditional Czech flavour and even to receive prizes from Bit- X.
Bitcoin Conference Prague was attended by over 150 guests, participants and Bitcoin enthusiasts. Next Bitcoin event from the organizer Smile-Expo Company will take place in Kiev in September. Stay tuned for the news in the sphere of cryptocurrency on our website bitcoinconf.eu. 
See you at new Bitcoin Conference!

The initial transfer to your offline generated address creates an unspent input you can later spend using your private key. Of course, that key have to be imported in your wallet software at that time. I haven't used that specific wallet client yet, but all wallet clients I tried so far have that option (electrum, multibit, mycelium, blockchain.info).
When generating paper wallet this way, I would use the option to print the encrypted private key.
3) paper wallet is just one address, no need to backup anything after new deposit(s). when withdrawing it's recommended to move entire balance. And never use that paper address again.

No. And your writing is even confusing me now ;)
1. to control your private keys, YOU have to create them, and save securely. You do that by downloading wallet software, checking it's genuine with a signature, and installing it. Wallet software then generates private key, public address, and a seed you have to write down and save (used to re-generate the private key in case wallet becomes corrupt). Then you send bitcoins from Coinbase account to your new address.
2. to create paper wallet:
 or

1. Transfer USD to exchange account (pay fee)
2. Buy bitcoin (pay fee)
3. Send bitcoin
4. Trade bitcoin for fiat (pay fee)
5. Withdraw fiat to bank account (fee?)

Reading about how bitcoin is treated in US, or Australia, I must say that Slovenian government is much more fair. There is a recommendation issued by Ministry of Finance regarding bitcoin and tax treatment of bitcoin.
In short - bitcoin virtual currency is not considered a monetary asset, and is not considered a financial instrument. Mining is considered as income, and is taxed (calculated on the value of bitcoin at the time it is received). Capital gains achieved by selling are not taxed.
Edit: valid for private persons.

Electrum wallet has a fee setting. The balance you are to move must be that much, at least. Standard fee in my Electrum is 0.0001 btc. You can try to put in lower transaction fee, or try to send without fee, but the transaction can then take weeks to confirm.

Latest versions of Electrum have a 'sweep' command - coins are moved from sending address to Electrum, without importing the private key. Private key is only used once to sign that transaction, and deleted from memory. 
I think that the problem is that his balance is lower than the Electrum is configured to use for tx fees.

No, nodes do not drop transactions from mempool. The wallet software you are using can give you the option to double spend those coins, if tx stays long time unconfirmed. Then out there are two transactions, with same coins, competing to confirm. Second one must pay higher fee.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:58:52
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:02:48

@_date: 2015-07-13 08:18:50
No, they do not get dropped. Your wallet may allow you to spend the coins in unconfirmed tx after some time (double spend). If you send the second tx with higher fee, it might get confirmed first.
@_date: 2015-07-12 07:03:17
He didn't 'get it back' - it's his wallet allowing him to double spend the same coins again. You can't delete/expire a transaction in other node's mempool.

Fee is not on the amount transferred, but on the space your transaction uses (bytes), and space depends on how many inputs and outputs are in your transaction. Paste here IDs of your transactions so we can better see what was going on.

* imported privkey, rescanned (takes more than 30 seconds, these days ;)
* was able to send the same input second time

Every node has its own pool of unconfirmed transactions, depends on how well connected the node is, how many peers has, how the tx get propagated... (36 connections and 11k txs in mempool on my node)

Poor propagation - network has a backlog of 50k transactions, and some nodes may have a problem with that. My node is still running, but your tx is not in the pool.

That's not related to long confirmation times we are all experiencing. Bitcoin is under attack - someone is spamming the network with transactions for three days now. 80K pending transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:30:04
All HD wallets I tried are using different change address on every tx. Let's say you requested several payments, each one on different address. Then you need to make a payment, but the amount is bigger than any single input you have on your receiving addresses. Wallet then combines them to make that payment. Tried Mycelium, it combines all inputs you have, even if only some would be enough to make that payment.

ShapeShift is right, first transaction has no fee. Under current spam pressure that tx has very low chance to go through.
Unfortunately, second transaction is using the output of the first transaction as one of its inputs.

Your first transaction has very low fee - 0.0001 btc, and the size of is 4619 bytes. Recommended fee is about 0.0001 btc per KB, not per tx.

Kraken is OK. My SEPA transfer was there in 4 hours. As for wallet, Bitcoin Core needs to download the whole blockchain, and validate it. It's 45 GB of data, and a day of heavy CPU crunching.

Nex time, put a higher fee there, like 0.0001 btc (it's 3 cents!)
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:20:48
There is no fork. It's a 'stress test' going, creating a backlog (50k transactions right now). Some nodes failed under that load, and you had poor connectivity so that tx did not get propagated to the network.
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:16:00
About 200K transactions a day at its current state.

Try what said above (bitcoin-qt -zapwallettxes), it's a lot easier. And post if it's working.
Before restarting, take a note what coins (inputs) did you send. Double spend must use exactly the same input, or you will be creating just another transaction and both can get confirmed.

You do need to export the private key of that address, close Core, backup your wallet, start Core to create new empty wallet, import private key, and spend it with higher fee. Then close Core again and restore your original wallet.

Your Bitcoin Core wallet put a fee of 0.00007011 btc for a tx of size 5537 bytes. That's default, but very low priority setting for estimated time to begin confirming within 25 blocks (4 hours). 
For faster confirmation next time, use higher fee - at the bottom of the Send page there is a Choose... button. It pulls up a form for setting a tx fee, select Recommended, but move the slider from 'normal' on the left to 'fast' on the right.

@_date: 2015-07-12 16:37:00
Double spend won't return your stuck transaction back to your wallet. That tx is on the network, and can't be deleted/returned.
With double spend, you can send out another transaction that uses the same coins (that's why 'coin control feature' has to be enabled) you used in the stuck transaction, but you put in higher fee, to try to make it confirm before the other (stuck) transaction. It's called Replace-By-Fee feature.

@_date: 2015-07-07 20:07:13
There is nothing you can do but wait. With given fee, my Bitcoin Core node estimates first confirmation to begin within 24 blocks (4 hours). You can try to 'double spend' - send these exact coins again, but with higher fee.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:27:30
You want out, so go out. Why ask here?
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:54:14
Yes, unconfirmed coins sit in unconfirmed pool forever. After some time your wallet will see that it's a stuck transaction, and will allow you to send the coins again - double spend. 
If you sent the coins, or change, to yourself, you can create a new transaction with this unconfirmed coins, put a higher fee (for new transaction, and for that stuck transaction) - it's called 'child pays for parent' and some minning pool might pick up your transactions faster.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:44:07
Downvoted doesn't mean you're wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:45:26
If a tx has sufficient fee, but is slow to propagate (due to spam attack going for three days), you can try to rebroadcast it. Post tx ID.

Network is spammed with transactions (for two days now, 60K transactions waiting), and yours has some very low fee. You are also spending one unconfirmed input from the tx you got before (14CqTRpotT7xARDBiTcXKsuh3USTZS4uCY)

Where is the transaction ID? Or do a 'getrawtransaction' in console and paste the output here, so we can try to re-broadcast it.
Or just wait some more, it will be confirmed, or dropped, and funds returned to you.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:20:51
Your tx is still unconfirmed (0 confirmations). May take a day under this conditions (80K pending transactions).
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:10:55
Seen by only one peer? That tx did not get broadcast to the network. My node doesn't have it. Try synchronizing your client and resend the tx.

No. Fees were paid, but very low. The issue is, that tx is using coins coming from unconfirmed transaction, and that tx has very low fees, too.

It's not very useful, b/c most of the nodes won't relay your double spend if they have original tx in the mempool. When some kind of replace-by-fee get implemented on the network, and wallets, it will be easier.
@_date: 2015-07-11 08:50:58
Coins you used in that transactions are unconfirmed, from tx 6b0fea9f913f6ef622077103f63f5c49707e1da8751941a8801d9aeda3724b03

 Yes, you should do the reset. Your tx did not propagate to the network, and you remove that tx from multibit by tools-reset.

Your computer does not need to be on. Your transaction is on the bitcoin network, just with very low priority. Network has a backlog of about 50'000 transaction b/c of a spam attack that lasted all week.

Bitcoin is all about cheap international transfers - of bitcoin :)
But here, you want to transfer fiat, from one bank to another. That's what banks do. Not an easy task providing this internationally with Bitcoin at this point - a company providing this would have to be present in every country in the world, 
and with enough liquidity there to do the exchange in local currency.

I recommend a fee of 0.0001 btc/kb. Click 'Choose...' button right of 'Transaction Fee:' label, and in that pull up pane move the slider to the right (fast), or select a 'custom' fee of 0.0001 btc, per kilobyte.
@_date: 2015-09-17 07:30:28
Yes, but to spend his 10 bits, OP needs  to add a fee. Standard fee in mycelium is more than 10 bits. So he has 0 as spendable.

Core/XT and Electrum wallets have a 'coin select' feature - you can select which input(s) to use for a transaction. That can help in example OP gave, but first he would need to make additional transactions to agregate 50 coins in single address.

Not true. ASCII parser is not forward-compatible with UTF-8. UTF-8 has new rules, that ASCII parser don't know about. It will try to parse UTF-8, but under its own old rules. It will go through, but will not be correct. In Bitcoin - if a new rule is added in stealth (soft) mode, old, non upgraded node won't be aware of that change. It will accept the input, but can't validate it under new rules. It's not fully-validating node anymore.

Is helpful. Transactions are 15k in size, fee is 0.00015 btc. That's 1 satoshi/byte. With minrelaytxfee=0.00005 you set a 5 satoshi/byte cut off policy. 
minrelaytxfee parameter is per kilobyte.

Out of the exchanges I tried, I found that Kraken.com has the lightest ID verification requirements: for deposits up to $2000 a day, total of $10000/month, only a name and address is required, and that must be the same as on the bank transfer order.
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:41:49
Here is your transaction:
It won't confirm, because is invalid - is using invalid inputs. You sent this transaction with unconfirmed coins, ie, before previous transaction confirmed. The problem started when malleability attacker doubled that same (previous) transaction and it confirmed first. So your transaction is using invalid coins.

@_date: 2015-10-04 06:50:18
In this malleabiliy attack that is going on, it can help to remove some confusion if you can set your wallet to not count unconfirmed coins as spendable.
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:52:05
No. That's malleability attack. Attacker sent second transaction, exactly the same as kryptokit did, same inputs and outputs, but different ID. Attacker's transaction got confirmed first, so the payment is done. But not with transaction with ID from kryptokit - that's why they sent you a message, but can't refund because payment is done, with attacker's transaction.

You are on the right track here, price and mining cost are connected, but it's the other way around: final goal is for mining costs to stabilize near bitcoin (block reward+fees) price.

You can not do that in Multibit. For double spending you must be able to select same inputs for second tx as they are in first, and Multibit doesn't have a 'coin control' option (AFAIK).
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:02:41
You are looking at it all wrong. That tx has no fee, and 0.09511953 is the CHANGE sent back to your address.
You are sending 1.1 BTC, but to sum up to 1.1 BTC wallet software had to use two 'inputs' you had in your wallet: 0.1987 BTC and 0.99641953. This makes 1.19511953 BTC.
1.1 BTC is then sent to a buddy of yours, and 0.09511953 BTC returned back to your address as change.
Take a look at that tx this way:

How can you say 'not the buyer's best protocol'? If you have a receipt, as you should when buying anything, that transaction is secured by the blockchain.

I'm a bitcoin believer, too, but I still don't see a point for using bitcoin to pay in person, and for amounts I have fiat cash in my pocket? To pay online is completely different story for me, even more as I don't have a credit card. Bitcoin is then the only option for me.

You did no mistake. You sent 0.4btc. Second transaction is from an attacker that is trying to confuse users and services, and your wallet got confused. One transaction is confirmed, 12 confirmations now, the other one is now invalid. The address 15o8... received 0.4btc.
Edit: on that link there are two transactions, one with ID 6eca... (confirmed, attacker's transaction), second with ID f3cf... (yours, unconfirmed and invalid now). Your wallet and blockchain.info got confuset because they were looking for original transaction (f3cf...), but attacker's got confirmed first, rendering original transaction invalid. Anyway, 0.4bct was send from your wallet to 15o8... address.

No, can not retract. You can try to 'double spend' that input with a proper fee, and hope some miner will pick that new tx before the original one. But blockchain.info wallet won't let you do this. Just wait some more, tx is valid, just low priority.

Or.. the price won't go up 'many times'. Some mining operations won't be profitable then, and will shut down. Mining difficulty goes down giving more profit to the ones that are still in mining... self adjusting process.

Your tx has one input of 0.7 BTC, and two outputs: 0.2 BTC to receiving address, and 0.5 as change back to your address. Tx is not confirmed yet (you sent without fee?), so your spendable balance is 1.3 BTC.

The wording of this title could be better - it's like that before this, virtual currencies were illegal in Italy.
