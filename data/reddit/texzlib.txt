The thing is, what we are seeing right now is the market self regulating itself.
We didn't need any regulations for it then and we don't need any for it now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:09:59
Well look who sponsored it. Feinstein. The queen bitch of regulating shit she doesn’t know jack shit about.

It went up almost 300% in the past 2 months or so.

GDAX is awesome.
Yes, they really fucked up right now and while it isn't an excuse, they are seeing huge gains in user base and trading activity almost weekly.
What cannot be forgiven is their roughshod roll out of BCASH. I literally woke up and saw a new trading option and was like "wtf is this".
But close to zero fees, relatively seamless trading, and good live prices. It's a good platform that needs scaling work.

I was really sold in the future of Litecoin. Been HODLing it since May.
Problem is, after this recent bull run with BTC, I couldn’t control my self and sold LTC at$90 for BTC at 16800!
Bahahaha, but yea, you think it will go up more?

I was impressed by the disel startup.
Might be an old F350, but it still has a meaty diesel.

Oh no

Who is he?
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:55:22
Just fucking great.
I should've sold my position when it spiked last night.
I am confident it's going to return in price, but that could be months from now.

[Here you go man](
The fee schedule changes depending on what you do, but it's still way lower than CB.
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:06:36
Because you will be helping increase liquidity in the market :)
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:30:26
And then I come in :)

Interesting, what do you mean ether is like oil? You mean it’s volatile price wise?
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:50:13
It is said that the Forerunners themselves used Bitcoin cash.
So we're only one level below that sort of greatness if we stick with bitcoin.

The Chinese politburo is like the small kings council in Game Of Thrones. Smart in doing things the way they do, and occasionally have good ideas, but for the most part, there to plunder their people for their own sake.

But this works too.

Lite coin is at 10!
Can anyone tell me why Litecoin has such high trading volume/volatility btw?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:40:57
I think that's a good idea :)
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:50:59
There's no physical bitcoin ����‍♂️����‍♂️����‍♂️��
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:30:06
So looks like we should move to Quebec or Washington.
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:05:47
Dude, this is the perfect time to sell if you've had a sizable chunk of money invested in Litecoin pre 75.
Sell and make a healthy margin.
The worst that can happen is you only made a 13% ROI (which is excellent) and LTC never goes up.
Never try to "hold out" a position that is already profitable when there is a rapid downward trend in prices. I learnt that the hard way with AMD a few weeks ago.
Sell, buy when low and it'll go up and you'll make double.
*This is only a recommendation.

Yea it does apply, that's why I stopped trading with Coinbase!

I know, China was the  or # 3 generator of crypto demand...I think a lot of people are in denial right now.

I'm holding.

Use GDAX, it's owned by Coinbase but the most you'll ever pay on commission is 0.25%, sometimes lower. Any money you have in Coinbase is instantly transferred to GDAX if you want it.
Coinbase is really expensive if you're purchasing and selling bitcoin.
GDAX also has a really nice interface and everything. I have to say, Coinbase has done an excellent job. If they IPO in a few years, they will do well.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:38:05
In pretty sure people would love to get rid of going through their banks.

Well, in the long term, if you believe in bitcoin, you'll make up your money.

Their oil quality is trash though. However, blokchain can revolutionize the oil industry.

I know haha, I was just joking.
But tbh, the idea has been coming up more and more in my head...
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:23:17
Fuck you!!! I hold LTC as well.
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:43:23
It's no Harvard B school, but I'll take it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:07:32
Why not sell your equity and just purchase LTC when it's cheaper?
I don't see any reason to hold LTC when the price is declining...like, there is no rational reasoning. You can reinvest that money again when it's low and make double when it goes back up.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:31:45
Man I put my college loans into this, so it better pay out well, I bought in at $4,500!!!

The west has not gone "nowhere". We've been chugging along: actually, nations like Canada and the US have enjoyed fairly robust growth.
China is merely catching up. It turn out going from 0 to 10 is a huge change and going from 100 to 110 is a much less noticeable change.

Damn I'm sorry man, don't know how to help here.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:00:17
LOL, the traders are making more money in that case haha.
It's a compounded buy low sell high, so a guy HODL might be making 20% but the trader will make maybe 40% because he sells the peaks and buys the troughs.
Of course, on average, the trader will loose and the guy HODL might be better off mentally instead of worrying about day trading lol.

Artificial quintile snitching of the easement markets resulting in a double pronged spike if the living averages which is causing some resultant lax uncertainty in the Litexoin and Ju koKoin markets which is resulting in a boost in the daily Blum bah blink fugitive

Debit is instant if that is what you want to use.
No problem man, sorry GDAX didn't work out!
