If the Fed's monetary policy has any significant effect on btc then movements in btc price would be strongly correlated with the stock market, which is essentially made by monetary policy at this point and is highly responsive to FOMC announcements (spoiler alert: there is no correlation).

Right, I wasn't thinking clearly when I made the comment about adding decimal places (I was half asleep). So yes, UBI could work with Bitcoin supply-wise, I was wrong about that. However, there is still a myriad of other, valid economic arguments against UBI -- that apply to any plans for redistributing wealth-- in the context of a fiat monetary system that could still be applied to a Bitcoin economy. Things such as a potential disincentive to work, lowered investment and thereby slowed growth, and another population related problem; as the population grows, the number of people who need a UBI increases, which means the government needs more revenue. In a Bitcoin economy, they can't print money, so they'll just have to increase taxes. This is true even if we infinitely divide the currency, because adding decimals doesn't actually free up any supply, all the Bitcoin is spoken for. So, the government has to take more, which will exacerbate the first two problems involved in a wealth redistribution policy. 
Also, I just want to point out that I'm not saying the consequences of UBI should automatically serve as grounds to reject it. I'm simply pointing out that the policy will limit growth in some capacity --although it is impossible to precisely calculate by how much -- and we can decide if the consequences are worth the UBI.

Author here, that's not really what this article was about. Manipulating the exchange rate by buying and selling is one of two ways the central bank can manipulate the BTC price. As I said in the article, they wouldn't buy and sell for any nefarious or conspiratorial purposes, central banks buy and sell all currencies in accordance with their needs. So, if Bitcoin ever becomes a currency on par with the Dollar or BSP, then its exchange rate will definitely be subject to central bank manipulation. 
The bulk of this article is about how BTC can be manipulated as an asset on par with gold or silver. BTC doesn't necessarily have to be a globally accepted currency to be manipulated by a central bank. In all likelihood, a Bitcoin credit bubble as a result of central bank open market operations would have a much larger impact on Bitcoin's price than simple buying and selling would.

From an economic perspective, it doesn't matter. Uncovering the *why* would be a very interesting discovery for the historian or psychologist, and Peter Surda is making some very interesting advances in uncovering the history of the origin of Bitcoin's value. However, as far as economic analysis is concerned, the *why,* regardless of what it is, does not make any difference in the outcome produced by analysis. All that is important is that people value or do not value it, economics is not concerned with the content or motivations of valuations, only their existence or non-existence.

I used one bank in my example to simplify a very complex system of money creation. The entire system works the same way it would work with one bank, just multiplied by how many banks there are. The limit placed on the banks' ability to create money is the supply of money. The banks can undergo the money creation process constantly because the Fed is constantly printing money. I don't know how else to say it: paying off debt to the bank does not mean that they delete all the money that they created from the loan you deposited in the bank, that is physically impossible. Even if they took your deposited loan off their balance sheet when you pay your debt (which they don't), it doesn't make the money they created from that deposited loan magically disappear; people have that money, they spend it, they deposit it, other banks use it to create more money. The central bank keeps the process going by printing more money. That's how it works.

Simply restating your previous argument does not make it any less wrong. Your belief that humans are capable of acting irrationally in a praxeological sense proves that you know very little, if anything, about economics in general--not just "libertarian" economics, whatever that is. Economics is a science, not a political doctrine, and disagreements between the various schools are on methodological grounds, not ideological. I'm being pompous because I find it very annoying that you are voicing such a strong (and stubborn, I might add) opinion on a subject you obviously know little about. I recommend reading the first few chapters of *Man, Economy, and State* by Murray Rothbard, take a break from that and read *Principles of Economics* by Carl Menger, finish *Man, Economy, and State,* and then read *Human Action* by Ludwig von Mises.

Lots and lots of the national debt is owed to the Federal Reserve. When the Treasury "borrows" from the Fed, they sell the Fed a Treasury bond and the Fed creates the money out of thin air. The government spends that money, injecting it into the economy, and then the effects of inflation permeate through the economy.

The coins from those mined blocks have never and will likely never be used, thus making any arguments about bitcoin income inequality completely irrelevant. I'll refer you to this [article.]( Plus, maybe proof of work is just a bad idea. One bad idea doesn't signal the failure of the entire free market. There are an infinite amount of crypto-currencies and, if Bitcoin doesn't work, there is bound to be one that solves the problems of Bitcoin. There are already coins in existence where a 51% attack is impossible, which seems to be one of the largest problems of Bitcoin judging by recent activity on this sub. If you look at the failure of a single project taking place on the free market, especially with it being the first of its kind, and say that the *entire* free market has failed, you seriously need to rethink what you're looking for in crypto-currency. More of the same? Instant security and wide adoption on par with that of fiat currency? Or are you looking for revolutionary innovation, which is what the advent of crypto-currency represents? Lastly, I strongly urge you to read some actual economic theory if you haven't already. That will also change your views on lots of things regarding the free market; this is all assuming that you don't believe in the efficacy of the free market, of course.

I agree with everything you said, except for price inflation. Of course, a general rise in prices would indeed cause a decrease in the purchasing power of money. However, there can be no general rise in prices without a general rise in demand. And there cannot be a general rise in demand unless the money supply increases. If the money supply remains equal, then an increase in the price of one good *must* result in a decrease in the price of another good. The only way a general rise in prices can happen is if the supply of money is increased and distributed equally throughout the economy.

Saving is actually an essential part of having healthy investment and legitimate growth in the economy. If people are consuming, it means they prefer immediately available consumer's goods rather than the more remote goods that would increase their standard of living that can be provided through investment. As a result, interest rates are higher because people will want more of a return since they have to give up their very highly desired immediate consumption goods. If people are saving, which deflation helps to encourage, then interest rates will actually go down, because there is lower demand for immediate goods and people won't lose as much value if someone borrowed their money to invest in a more remote means of production. 
What central banks do, and is probably why you equate consumption with investment, is they try to encourage increased investment during periods when time preferences are very high, which means that interest rates are high. By artificially lowering interest rates and pumping money into the economy, the production structure is shifts and points towards more remote goals rather than satisfying the demand for immediate consumer's goods. So what happens is that all these enterprises start up because of the cheap credit and have essentially no demand, so they are completely reliant upon credit. Once the stimulus fails, those credit-addicted businesses naturally go bankrupt and fail. But not before they employ a bunch of people and pay them high salaries. The result of that increased employment is a stimulation in demand and a subsequent increase in prices. So, when the whole thing falls apart, millions of people are left without a job and prices are so high that the individuals who weren't benefited by the credit expansion can't afford to pay for many basic living expenses. As a result, demand goes down and prices go down as well. Then, people start going after more immediate consumer's goods and interest rates go up. The central banks see this as a problem and attempt to stimulate investment. The process starts all over again. 
So there's a basic explanation of the importance of saving and how a deflationary economy actually encourages investment. Hopefully you found it helpful and interesting.

Paying down the debt doesn't contract the money supply, it expands it. When you take out a loan and put it in the bank, the bank doesn't care if that money came from a loan or not, they just add it to their balance sheet as an addition to their monetary assets. So, if you borrow $1000 from bank the bank and put it in your bank account, the bank doesn't add an earmark that says "this is debt." They simply treat the deposit as if they received $1000 of new money. So, when you pay the debt back, the $1000 that made up the principle loan is not cancelled out or removed from the balance sheet. You deposit your loan: the bank adds $1000 to its reserves, you pay back the loan: the bank adds another $1000 to its reserves. This means that your loan has added $2000 to the money supply, plus the fractional loans that come from it. They loan out fractions of the money that they *loaned you,* and when you pay the loan back, they loan out fractions of *that* amount of money. They strike nothing from the asset portion of their balance sheet in this situation, they only add to it.

Yeah, UBI... That kiiiiind of requires an elastic money supply because it can't be funded through taxation alone (as per the laffer curve). Even if it could be funded solely through taxation, it would require *taxation.* Bitcoin is not an elastic currency at all, and the very nature of Bitcoin makes it extremely easy for people to earn a tax-free income. So, the way I see it, supporting Bitcoin and UBI is kind of contradictory. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:51:31
You perfectly described how the purchasing power of a unit of currency increases as its supply remains fixed while demand increases. But you're missing the point about having to provide an equal amount of currency to everyone in the world at the same time. Deflation solves the problem of scarce currency because there is income inequality; some people receive more, other receive less, and that distribution is reformulated through the price system as buying and selling takes place. But with UBI, everyone has to get an equal amount every month. For example, lets start with a supply of 2 million dollars and 1 million people. Every person gets $1, and the other million is allocated based on prices, profit, and loss. But, let's say the population suddenly increases to 4 million. 4 million people are now entitled to $1, but there are only 2 million dollars in existence. Obviously, you have to increase the money supply to continue the UBI guarantee for the expanded population. As for continuously adding decimal places to Bitcoin, that makes the supply unlimited, thus defeating the purpose of Bitcoin. Additionally, what happens when there is a decrease in reproduction or a natural disaster that shrinks the population? Inflation, boom, bust. That cycle will happen because the money left behind won't be distributed evenly, it will be allocated based on inheritance or debt cancellation. Of course, you could use the government to divide that surplus currency evenly throughout the population; this method would still create inflation and business cycles, although perhaps not as severe. Also, such a confiscatory policy would be decidedly anti-libertarian, which is what OP branded the Pirate Party as. So, I think we both agree that you cant have UBI without an unlimited money supply -- because that was my main argument and you basically conceded to that argument by saying we would have to add more decimals to Bitcoin. Where we disagree is on your claim that doing so would not cause inflation; it definitely would because of inevitable population shifts and unequal distributions of surplus currency/an absence of a uniform spending to saving ratio of an equally distributed currency surplus. So again, if you're trying to guarantee UBI with an unlimited money supply, there's going to be inflation; if you're trying to guarantee UBI with a limited money supply, you're going to run out of money and will be forced to discontinue the program. UBI and Bitcoin are simply incompatible on an economic level.

I have been independently studying Austrian economics in-depth for over a year, learning far more than what I could learn in a few semesters of econ classes at college (I'm taking those classes too, though). So I sympathize with your skepticism of the Fed and fractional reserve banking, I too believe that the Fed shouldn't exist. However, unless I misread your post, you're extremely misinformed on the nature of fractional reserve banking. You won't create any deflation at all by paying off existing debts. Paying back that $1000 doesn't cancel out the tens of thousands that were created from you putting that $1000 loan in the bank. In fact, paying back that debt creates *more* inflation, because you've actually given the bank $2000! They got the first thousand when you deposited your loan in the bank, then they got the second thousand when you paid the loan back. They don't cancel out the first thousand when you repay it, they just add your payment next to your loan under the asset section of their balance sheet. Essentially, your debt allowed the bank to undergo two cycles of money creation. No money was removed from the economy at all. The only way to create deflation outside of central banking policy is to refrain from putting your money in the bank at all; that way, it can't get loaned out and new money can't be created from it. 
Also, when the price of Bitcoin goes down, that means it's inflating, not deflating. For when the price goes down, you can't buy as many goods with the same amount of BTC. Bitcoin is not a consumption good in itself, it is a currency that people can invest in with their fiat. So, when the price goes down, that means people are selling their BTC, dumping it on the market, which makes the supply larger than the demand. Consequently, the value goes down. Don't think of BTC as a good in the same category as food or cars, think about it as a foreign currency. Lower BTC prices=an increase of supply over demand=inflation. Higher BTC prices=an increase of demand over supply=deflation.
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:07:49


Supply and demand. Bitcoin supply is fixed, the population is continuously growing. Since every person would be entitled to a certain amount of money every month, a growing population would constantly increase the demand for money. At some point, the number of people on earth will surpass the number of available satoshis. Once that happens, once supply surpasses demand, it would be impossible to provide everyone with a fixed amount of Bitcoin per month. A fixed money supply with no UBI can work with a growing population because the purchasing power of each unit of BTC will rise, and everyone will have varying levels of income. But, if we are going to give everyone a base amount of income each month, then there has to be a large enough supply for everyone to have an equal amount. Thus, a UBI requires an elastic money supply, thereby making Bitcoin and UBI incompatible *economically,* not politically or morally.

The quote in the OP makes much more sense when read in context. It isn't saying that altcoins and Bitcoin are equal to one another, it is saying that there is no theoretical, *a priori* reason for Bitcoin to inevitably prevail over altcoins -- just as there is no such reason to argue that fiat will inevitably prevail over Bitcoin. In other words, it is theoretically *possible* for an altcoin to overtake Bitcoin, but highly unlikely.

All of those things assume, and have been happening under, a monetary system in which the supply of money has been steadily increasing for 100 years.If there were a fixed supply of money, with no way of duplicating or printing it out of thin air, none of those things could happen simultaneously. 


There can be no general rise in wages under a fixed supply of money. Wages increase (absent of any government intervention) as a result of an increase in demand in a certain area of production. Since there is a fixed amount of money, an influx of money into one area must be met by an outflow of money from another area. Why? because there is only a certain amount of money held by the consumers, so if demand in one area increases, demand in another area must necessarily decrease. The only way demand, and therefore prices, can experience a *general* increase is if the monetary supply increases. Such an increase in the supply of money would be called "monetary inflation" under your definitions and not "price inflation." 


This would be an example of "monetary inflation" and not "price inflation" 


Again, given a fixed supply of money, an increase in prices in one area of production--resulting from an increase in demand-- must be met by a decrease in another area. There can be no *general* increase in prices, where *all* prices rise. 


This would be an example of "monetary deflation," because the government has deliberately contracted the money supply, assuming that they themselves do not spend it. 


A decrease in supply would cause deflation, not inflation. If supply falls below demand, then the same level of consumption that occurred before the supply contraction cannot be sustained, and therefore prices will fall and not increase. And again, a general decrease of supply would be "monetary deflation" and not "price deflation."

Yes, they are all about Austrian economics, but the foundational principles of the Austrian school have been adopted by the mainstream schools and are used as a basis for mainstream economic thinking. The differences in methodology occur a little farther into the theories. So, when reading an Austrian take on rational action, you're pretty much reading what Paul Krugman and the rest of the Keynesians think about human action. Once you get the basics down, come back to me and we can argue about the actual differences that occur in more complex areas of the methodology.

This statement is in line with the argument of the article. Altcoins will likely not become innovative enough to totally overthrow Bitcoin, but they can reveal potential improvements that Bitcoin can adopt to become even stronger. The quote in the OP makes much more sense when read in context. It isn't saying that altcoins and Bitcoin are equal to one another, it is saying that there is no theoretical, a priori reason for Bitcoin to inevitably prevail over altcoins -- just as there is no such reason to argue that fiat will inevitably prevail over Bitcoin. In other words, it is theoretically possible for an altcoin to overtake Bitcoin, but highly unlikely.

Even though the attack was reversed, it was a huge amount of money. Plus, it resulted in a hard fork without consensus, something everyone in the Bitcoin community fears (hence why we've been so reluctant to make a move on scalability). I'd say it qualifies as the biggest one just because of the unprecedented consequences and the number of people involved in the community.

Onecoin is a scam, not a failure. The scams/hacks that were included in this list ruined otherwise legitimate currencies (Dogecoin/DAO). 
I included PayCoin because after Garza used it to scam everyone, the fanboys tried to turn it into a legitimate coin but failed. 
In fact, Onecoin is actually a wildly successful scam, far from a failure in any sense of the word.

Hi Andreas, Evan Faggart here, senior editor at Bitsonline. The Bitsonline article you are referring to is the one where we reported on your GitHub update announcing that you removed all references to blockexplorer.com, because they, as you said, “are trying to push Bitcoin Cash propaganda with a modal window. Confusing for newbies and inappropriate for a textbook. GTFO  
Here is a screenshot of your GitHub update where you say that: 
Our article sticks to that update, is factual, and contains no sensationalism or factual errors that I can see. All our references to removing the site from your book come from the GitHub page, or your direct quotes contained in the commit. Our headline that saying you ‘slam’ the site comes from your inflammatory comments scattered throughout the commit, namely the ones where you said ‘GTFO’ and ‘ Here is another screenshot from GitHub with such a comment. 
Our article even states that we attempted to reach out to you for a quote so you could clarify your statements, but you did not respond. We have heard from other editorial teams at different cryptocurrency sites that they have had the same problem with you. It is hard for us to report on your statements in a way that satisfies you if you consider your own comments factually incorrect and do not respond to media inquiries for clarification. We are always happy to talk with you and get your true thoughts on an issue, all you have to do is respond to our attempts to contact you. 
We at Bitsonline strive for objectivity and factual reporting, as well as opinion pieces supported by verifiable facts. We report on updates regarding both Core and BCH, and do not hold an official editorial stance that supports one version of Bitcoin or the other.

Bitcoin, as it stands, is predominately valued as an investment vehicle -- as a means of generating wealth through speculation.
However, it's also used as a means of preserving wealth too, particularly in countries that have problems with inflation.
For Bitcoin to move past this stage and become a full-blown money that people regularly use, then it will have to penetrate the production process more deeply.
In other words, more people have to get paid in Bitcoin. 
This could cause Bitcoin-based demand for goods to increase -- giving businesses reason to hold in Bitcoin and, in turn, to pay for resources used in their production lines with it.

Bitcoin has balls of steel
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:43:35
If I'm understanding you correctly, then you would be referring to bitcoin as a unit of account. 
It's one of the main characteristics of money -- the ability to make economizing decisions via prices. 
Once people begin to understand how much they subjectively value a unit of a currency, it then allows people to make their respective budgeting decisions with it.
Any currency can become a unit of account, people just have to become acclimated to its price structure by repeatedly making purchases with it.
This article gives a good and easy to understand explanation of this process by using caps in Fallout 4 as an analogy.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:16:50
Andreas who lmao. Don't get economics mixed up with philosophy and ethics. Governments achieve both by restricting access to sound money. Case in point: the United States. They banned gold so the Fed could inflate the money supply, giving them both economic power over citizens and allowing them to build a militaristic empire that exerts control over the entire world.
Why choose one when you can have both, why do you have to decide what is more important when you can achieve both goals at the same time? This is an economic question, and economics is about what something 'is,' not what something 'should be.'

Any time you buy something with bitcoin and you provide a shipping address, you have linked your identity to a bitcoin address. Of course, this is much harder to trace than a credit card payment -- it may be so hard to trace that it isn't even worth the expense -- but it is not truly anonymous. This will be true no matter how decentralized the Internet becomes; if you have to give an address to have something shipped to your house, you are giving up your anonymity. Other than just sending bitcoin back and forth between addresses without actually buying or selling anything, it is pretty hard to use bitcoin with a completely concealed identity.

You essentially just described a network effect, which is completely compatible with the Austrian theory of the origin of money.

Well that was a long winded reply that didn't really say anything of value. Again, if you have to rebuy a currency after every time you spend it, *just so it doesn't die,* then it isn't a currency worth having. I'm not saying that Bitcoin needing to be supported is a flaw. I'm saying that Bitcoin does not need to be supported in this particular way, and urging people to pay for everything twice does not send a good message to the outsiders that we want to bring in.

I agree, I've always wondered how banks think they're going to get around tokens when they implement blockchains. I've generally assumed that they would find some way of making them work, like pegging pre-mined tokens to fiat for the purposes of transferring them or something like that.

@_date: 2015-03-09 14:34:38
I understand why people say this, buying back the btc is supposed to cancel out the downward pressure you just put onto the market (questionable). But why on earth do you expect people to pay for everything twice? It's ludicrous. When I buy something with btc, it's because using btc is easier and faster than fiat. I don't care about the effect my spending will have on the price because at this point the network effect is big enough to absorb a couple hundred dollars from me without driving btc down. If a currency has to be constantly supported by rebuying it with another currency every time you purchase something, then it's not really a currency worth having. How would you react to someone who told you that you should use euros to rebuy your dollars every time you buy something or pay some bills so that the value of the dollar doesn't go down?
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:21:47

Exactly. They'd stop using fiat altogether. They'd use btc for hoarding and spending, it would replace fiat. Again, Gresham's Law only applies when there is a MANDATED PARITY between two currencies, where you HAVE to spend btc at a face value that's lower than its real value. You hoard the btc because you'd be spending at a loss. That's not the case with a freely floating exchange rate, you'd be gaining value by spending btc and abandoning fiat completely.

The Bitcoin community is very reluctant to believe Craig Wright's claims of being Satoshi, what do you guys think?
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:18:03
Ok but that's not Gresham's Law, not even close. BTC won't disappear into hoards in your scenario, people will probably just use fiat to pay  taxes and debts owed to the government and use BTC for everything else.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:25:08

Gresham's Law only applies when a government sets a parity between two currencies that undervalues one and overvalues another one. So if the government sets a BTC-USD parity where $1=1 BTC, then yes, Gresham's law will take effect. But as long as the exchange rate between the two currencies freely fluctuates, the law does not apply. If the dollar keeps going down in value, people will just start using bitcoin as much as possible, they won't hoard a currency that's growing in value while spending with one that is getting less valuable every day. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:04:52
No, it doesn't currently have more utility than fiat. Because it's only 6 years old. It will gain more utility as it is improved over time. Time is a necessary thing to consider when thinking about the adoption of new technology. You're comparing a technology that has had 6 years to evolve to a technology that has had 100 years to evolve.

@_date: 2017-06-04 21:07:47
No. There was a massive crash of almost $1000 that sent the price down into the $2000s. Just a short time later we're already back up to $2500.

I work for bitcoin, I get paid in bitcoin at a USD rate. I was making money in 2015 when it slowly crashed the entire year, and I'm making money now at $2500. Not because I'm an investor, but because I work hard and earn my money. 
I don't care about the price, I care about Bitcoin's overall success. It's just that the price seems to be an indicator of confidence in the tech -- that's why I'm excited.

Hi Charlie, Evan here. On Twitter you implied that you [Jaxx] were fixing this issue (
But here it seems like you're saying there isn't a problem? Am I wrong in inferring that? Is there a problem or isn't there? And what kind of security are you guys working on?
Apologies for not reaching out to you while writing the article, breaking news like this has to get out ASAP. Hope you understand.
