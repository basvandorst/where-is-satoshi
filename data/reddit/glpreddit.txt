I got your point, just try to broaden your horizons \^\^
A graphic/Asic card can give them Bitcoins for their currency... by consuming electricity paid with that currency and accepted by their electricity provider... as an example.
But wait, many ppl give USD &amp; Bitcoins for shit like a virtual poor lap dance right ?
btw, what I said is that they have not access to foreign currencies, I mean, on the two directions (buying and selling), but with bitcoin they can sell their knowledge, mental/physical efforts and other "goods &amp; services" (financed with local currencies) and get Bitcoin (or other Cryptos), which  they can send everywhere or just HODL in safe hash.
this is not always possible with USD &amp; Co. for them and this is the key problem in such situation, it is not a problem to find who make a deal with, but how to do it.

You missed my point,
As they can sell at every time, they are not "trapped" on the falling crypto they baught, when the prices beggins to fall they sell.
You put it like it was a prison or a falling car and they will be "emprisoned" on it without a chance to get out of it when they feel the need/urgence to do so.
The volatility of bitcoin (or other crypto) is not  so high that they risk to lose a huge part of their capital in a day, and with such investment they will have a tool called hedging  to protect themselves from these fluctuations and even from the big monthly mouvments that can happen.
The only case they will lose their capital is if Bitcoin or the hedging counter part AND all other cryptos fall to ZERO at the same time and in no enought time to get out. which is less probable than getting our gold or bank depisits &amp; shares  [confiscated]( in no time and without ANY MEAN to resist &amp; save OUR wealth.
With Bitcoin (and other crypto) combined to the classic risk &amp; portfolio managment technics, we have a bunch of security improvments added to our capital investment than without Bitcoin. like the ease of FREE transfert from &amp; to every point of the glob, the FREE access to liquidity to cash-out at every time, the  anonymity ....ect
You can't be so secure &amp; comfortably FREE with physical gold or real estate do you ?

to figure it out, we need to answer to this question: is it hierarchical ? Obiouvsly and despite all the sophistication YES. so, it is a simulation of decentralized system, it is not really decentralized by design.
There is other aspect which they are comparable and different, like Distribution,which all bring the resilience of Bitcoin agaisnt local failures and it is not the case for Visa's system architecture and alike (centralized exchanges, pools...).

I agree with that, this is the "fission" workaround centralization fragility. at some point, the system will reach a practical decentralization state, but there will be allways a lack of distribution, wich part is not "simulable" at reasonable cost.
Bitcoin is decentralized AND distributed by design (relatively 0 cost).
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:32:13

No, it is so apparently reliable till the first "bug" : when this failure happen, the card castle collapse, it is by design of centralization (like with banks and their financial schems) . The decentralized architicture is reliable not by apparence but by design, it is robust and failure resistant. When something goes wrong the system stay operational till the problem is solved and continue to work better after the patch as nothing happened after that.
So, when something goes wrong in a centralized system, one need to pray, but in decentralized, we look to the next update/evolution step.

Rudundancy is not decentralization but a simulation of it. It is often fission of Hierarchical system. This europ failure example illustrate it well: When a node fail it affects a group of members dependant of that node (may be the whole system when the node is the head) like what happen with big pools/minners/exchanges... in crypto world, but with a real and effective decentralization, the problem affects only a single member, thus, in theory (ideally designed decentralization ) the whole system crashing because an intrinsic problem is not  possible.

@_date: 2018-06-01 22:50:20
When coded to product an intentional action "A" but fail (in all or some specific contexts) = bug, example: if click then show(a/b) . (work as intended till b=0)
When coded to product "A" and success but with a wrong action "B" also (in some specific contexts) which was not intentional = glitch.
Example: if window.isOpen then window.Close. (working well as intended till a baby put its finger)
Bugs happen because coder have not integrated known problematic contexts, glitches happen because coder have not integrated (all) the unknown (for him) possible contexts. 
 glitches are rationally proven inevitable, so they can't be avoided by any auto system (helper like a debugger), we use technics and protocols to limit them and/or limit their impact (trade offs, limiting the solution space...)

I agree with you except on the last paragraph, when there is a successful deal, this mean that the buyer valuation  met the seller valuation, otherwise we will have a spread between bid and ask with no agreement yet, therefore: you effectively valuated the milk &gt;= 1 USD, not only &gt;1, same conclusion for the seller and this agreement (=1) triggers the exchange.
To get the idea more precisely (as a side not) , think that when you are valuating the 1liter milk 1 USD, you are in fact valuating your 1 USD &gt;= 1 liter milk because you earned and own the 1 USD not the milk, it's the seller who is valuating his milk 1 USD. Every owner set the initial value as every owner has the information needed about it's "good" to be able to know what is the break even value. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:15:04

as much as I adhere to the decentralized exchange solution, i don't like the crypto-bridge concept as they are "tricking" ppl, it's not a decentralized exchange even if they are running on a decentralized blockchain (BitShare), they "hold" the deposited coins which they just swap to their own created assets and deposit on the user wallet they fully control. Said in other words: if tomorrow CB cease business, all the deposits will worth 0, ppl will have no way to recover them from another BitShare client.
As for your question above:
\&gt;  What is a "zero game"?
I meant, a zero sum game. As the funds lent by the exchange to the users is believed/marketed/expected coming from other user's deposits (or from the exchange own funds), thus, at any time, the total coins in circulation should be equal to what is shown by the blockchain, this is the "normal" healthy situation that is verified by this action.
In other hand, the  reprehensible  situation is when the exchange lend out coins that does not exist on the blockchain, by using/perpetuating a classical trick used by banks (fractional reserves...ect) : creating credit / issuing debt out of thin air (virtual accounting numbers), that can be spent while it is not backed by any equivalent asset on the blockchain, this is the source of every pyramidal scam's crash the flat world faced and which the crypto world was designed to avoid, thus, the actual rush on the exchange is a healthy celebration that remind us what's crypto is about, even if it is not as effective at it should be, the message is perpetuated.

there are already many tokens backed by gold, do your research please.
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:51:44


This is not my intention, but i got your point and i totally agree with.


Indeed, it cannot be owed to any other planet, but it can be owed to other generation of the same world (but not the same economic system). this "time" notion is a fundamental part of both the interest and the debt concepts. for example, when you owe something to someone, there is a schedule for the pay back and for the interest calculation. if they change, it mean that this is a new debt and, thus, there was default on the previous debt.


but it may be not existing. please consider the example of a simple fraction of interest and let me know what do you think: if you agree that the paiement of this interest is not "returning back an existant real wealth" but is basically a lost wealth owed wich become a real wealth if payed off, then it will be just a matter of scalling and imagination to agree of the possibility of a "huge not existing part which shall be payed back but debtors just can't create it on time." state. this huge part is actually a lost wealth not yet created but must be settled  (as by the agreements).
I am not sure if you get what i mean, so, i will try with your own words: the lost is not from the earth, but from the global "cash register" at a given periode of time, someone have wrongly entered (X) wealth, while there is actually ( X - n ) wealth.


sure, as long as every debt become covered by a unit of wealth. 
the negative effect is perceived when there is an excessive accumulation of intermediary debt defaults.


I like this example, let me think about it.

@_date: 2018-07-12 22:45:27


No it is not, just started learning months ago from you all here and there, while I am doing my best, I sincerely appreciate your efforts. 
But I assure you that my english understanding does not suffer from any flaw. 


So, i will quote you (thus i will not be putting words on your mouth):


Which mean that every debt on the world can be settled. this is a zero game system.
and same with the inter-nationally wrong illustration you give:


It is the case only when this is a zero-sum game, but as you seem agreeing for: it is not. so, since it is possible that: 
 debt to pay = debt contracted + X (interest, printed money...) at the settlment time , those citizen can be in a situation where they should pay **more wealth** than the contracted debt value, not the same wealth. Tell me if there is really a need of a numerical illustration here.
How can it be only a question of "who pay" and not a question of "how much should be paid" with this system ?
Same reasoning apply at any scale (world, universe...) .
For the global default to be assumed impossible (in a non zero sum model), it must be considered on an infinite time scoope, or an infinite world size (can be transfered from japanese people, to the aliens ont the Moon, Mars..), or on an hypotetical infinite wealth creation. but beyond the fact that these considerations are not realistic, they do not really avoid the global debt default possibility. (below i will develop on the first assumption that you already argued with on other posts if i am not mistaken)
Regarding this japanese illustration, when the extra wealth these citizen should payback become unsustainable, they will simply moving what they can not payback, to future generations (Japan) or to other nations ( if we consider it on a global system ) or other time deadlines (debt on debt), otherwise, they will be defaulting. 


As said above, an impossibility of a debt default do only make sens on a zero sum game configuration on our real world, where every debt can be payed back, otherwise there will be a global debt default possibility where there is a need to settle all debts+unbacked debts and there will not be enought wealth creation to back them.
So, as there may be only two possibilities: positive or negative sum. if at any given time when it is a negative state there is a reason/need to settle the global debt (economic crisis, geopolitical, unbearable volumes, Trumpism.....), then there will be debt default, and the global unbacked debt part will probably never be payedback at any reasonable time because a global default will be probably resulting from the accumulation of many other previous ones. Also, the said unbacked debt may have simply been wasted, in this case: everyone (or at least, some parties) on the world will pay for a wealth which did not economically benefit to anyone (no wealth creation), the worst case, is when this extra debts will have been used to destroy real wealth (war...), this situation can be summarized as follow: **virtual wealth creation from thin air (because there will never be enough real wealth and this is the cheapest/easiest thing to do) financing the destruction of real value wealth which accelerate the vicious cycle and the debt default moment, the net product is the parties paying for a thin air and/or a systematic waste of wealth**, this is our current state.
Now, for the infinite time assumption :
 If we ~~hope~~ consider that any lacking real wealth can be compensated by future wealth creation, this is just moving the problem of debt failure on a hypothetical future, here, the sum can be either positive or negative too, and we will just loop,  this is  what we are actually doing,  until there will be a need &amp; impossibility to settle.**The Debt default is systematic.**
The problem with the irrealistic "infinite time",  is that on one hand the negative sum can evolve forever too, probably growing in volume and % of existent wealth, and on the other hand, we can't reasonably assume that the needed creation of the actual and future missing wealth is always guaranteed (**we can't create wealth at will, this is ressource-driven**) and that it can allways be correlated to the growth of the negative sum  (**which is boosted at will, the unbacked debt is need-driven**). **So, the moment of the systematic Debt default is innevitable.**
at this end of the day/game turn (not at infinity), if there is allways a negative balance and no enough wealth  created to back it, there will be virtual numbers which can only be ... **removed** from this global ledger: this is the global default. and this is the part which bitcoin make impossible on it's ledger implementation, but most important, the "creation at will" part of artificial value is also impossible on the bitcoin blockchain.
Please tell me if you have any objection at this point, i will continue for the "inherently bad thing" part later when we agree about all the above if you are interested.
I did my best, I hope it is more clear, otherwise feel free to point any ambiguous  point.

There is real examples of when you can't use/grow your own money, so you take the risk to lent it to who can do it for you both.
Your assumptions are all based on an idealistic and rational reasoning, that's not realistic and you can verify it by revisiting the history lessons like i suggested to you on my other comment on this.

I infered. it is not me putting words, but those words are what your assertion imply by a logical inferance, you denied this implication here:


so i elaborated on this point, 


you can objecte on any flaw on the reasoning, otherwise, they are equivalently your words. (not wanting to harass you on this)
it is just like if i say: "sky is blue", it imply that the sky is coloured, boths are equally "my worlds", not you putting "coloured" on my mouth if you point it.


Literally yes...


Great: i asked, indeed.
* How can it be only a question of "who pay" and not a question of "how much should be paid" with this system ?
Given the facts that:
* not every debt is backed by existent real wealth nor securitized.
* a debt can grow, it's growth can be so bigger that it's payback need more wealth creation than what is really possible to produce to pay it back on time.
Edit: 
The other question that i have not expressed yet: if a global debt default is impossible, where the creditors found the non existant wealth to give back to debitors ? when Total debt &gt; Total wealth creation.

There is a lack of numbers to appreciate the whole picture at it's just value, like what was the number of retries and the routing fails at such a "just beginning and  little cluttered" stage.

@_date: 2018-07-12 21:24:14
You need to revisit just a half of that historic time-line but with some healthy logical rules.
 Starting by not deliberately assuming Debt is  ideally a zero sum game, this should be the conclusion to confirm, and it's impossible as long as there is interests (accountant numbers not backed by any real wealth) , this is the abvious counterexample and there is a lot of others. 
And then, you will not assume other  mistake, like "creditors can't be so stupid" and you will integrate the fact that creditors have mostly no other option to be competitive (china) , or they have huge ROI as long as they maintain the ponzi scheme like the incentive of just to exist  (Saudi Petro $ debt machine) ... There is allot of others cases where creditors are happy/unhappy  to lent their wealth to others  debitors known to fail, like for a geopolitical benefit (Greece) or fascist ideology (OK, it's out of the scope of 50 years...)
But wait, there is a yet more obvious example which show how  you are too idealistic with the zero sum assumption : what about the wealth destruction? Both at it's natural form (guess how) and  human ~~impossible~~ stupidity cause.

~~EDIT: more clarifications.


given my poor english, i will rely on Oxfords English Disctionary:


And, as you suggested:


by considering an academic definition:


Finance : Debt is usually scheduled with a series of regular cash outflows (installments) to repay its principal amount along with interest by a borrower to the lender.






If debt was not money, there is no "formed Debt" by the academic definition, but just an agreement on a no-value. It is like saying that money itself does not represent any value (which can be *partially* true in fact; when a currency is backed by debt and numbers from thin air). 
The agreement/contract hold the value of its composants (principal, interest...) which are wealth + numbers from thin air, like an agreement on a 1$ value make it hold the agreed value portion. 
The proof of above is that debt is actually considered as a [store of value]( just like money:


 by forming the  [borrowed capital]( which can be a part of that financial capital:


Businesses need capital to operate. **Capital is wealth** that is used to generate more wealth. For businesses, capital consists of assets — property, factories, inventories, cash, etc. Businesses have two options to **acquire** these: debt and equity. **Debt is money** that is borrowed from financial institutions, individuals or the bond market. Equity is money the company already has in its coffers or can raise from would-be owners or investors. The term "borrowed capital" is used to distinguish capital (assets) acquired with debt from capital (assets) acquired with equity.
And if there are still any doubts, [Borrowed Capital](


This is capital which the business borrows from institutions or people, and includes debentures:


* Irredeemable debentures
* Debentures to bearer
* Ordinary debentures
* bonds
* deposits
* loans
If you have any reading suggestion, especially on the linguistic part about Wealth and Debt, please don't hesitate. for the conceptual part i think we can just rely on an universal language which are logical reasoning and math, this is usually sufficient and the most efficient languages.

So, who will invest on bnb for same reasons? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:17:40
I think that the concept of inflation itself is not good: when you have 1 unity of value this should be the same 1 unity of value in any context and at any time, not just 1 unity of that virtual label X. When a currency loses value by the artificial deflation of its virtual value, it is a scam: ppl ( trust the virtual value and agreeing with the concepts) will pay the loses with their pockets virtual value. (distributed), it is a form of tax finally.
This artificial inflation/deflation need some radical redesign if we want to not them affect the real value of a currency. In their actual use (by govs) they are like each day a market fixes the prices of ALL goods that ppl buy/sell.
There is also some other worst concepts levraging the problem like interrest... And i feel that crypto are adopting the same biais and want to compeete with that in fact (incentives for speculations).
A currency will be stable when speculators have no incentive to speculate on its virtual value (regardless of its real one) , thats why art works are stable and mostly growing, and thats why they are one of the prefered store of value form.
Thats also why we hear "such a good project/coin but so under rated"

Without pow it will not be rare. Pow is the guarantee that 1 specific unit is unique, rarity determine (with other parameters) the amount of value that unit can hold at T instant. So, pow = value, rarity =amount of value.

It will be possible with a second generation cryptos wich will not be tradable on exchange UNLESS they have real world use. Their nominal value will be stabilized to the products values. For now, coins prices are a cross_speculatives values, and the whole refer to the big cap ones.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:20:41
Never. Like with flat, there will be ALWAYS speculation. But the usuability of crypto will be more boosted gradually, when speculators effects are less than ppl who push cryptos to that path.

i don't care and i have not tell something like that simply because it is not relevant for an objective point of view. so, why are you assuming that i care about the "man" not about the arguments ? (it is rhetoric here.)


yeah... it is open without any deadlines, as for every "step" in their most basic "to do" list. the yesterday dust problem solution is an epic example on how they "project" their progression. when someone point them the fact that this kind of sketchy problem should be adressed on a few days basis  not 8 months, they answer: "*we never told that we were working 8 months on it*", but throughout the complaints made before, they was systemacilly responding that "it is not simple to implement a solution for that, but we are working hard on it". 
btw, this is not my point, the point (fact) that you missed here by your objective analyse (talking about the man not the BNB that i clearly pointed)  is that it's a "one man leaded" **coin**. wich is burned (when and on what proportion)  as it pleases to it's own central emitter. did you need some info on this?
i ask you to reread my question, with more bjectivity in mind. otherwise we can't have a healthy debate.
When you will understand the following argument example, you can say that you "got it" the right way :


The marketting plan regarding bnb coin, is worst than not having any, because it is proven "contradictory", for example: a mythic quote of the lead : *"No decentralized exchange today can handle our volume, and none are as secure as we are. Changpeng Zhao"* and one of the key goal on their plan is: "Binance is planning to launch a decentralized exchange in the coming months and almost everyone is invited, founder and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao said."  and for acheiving this example goal: "Binance Coin (BNB) will be upgraded to exist on its own blockchain mainnet"
the new DEX (decentralized) will be powered  by an upgraded BNB coin, at a 1 to 1. do you see what that implies?
The only **suscceful** investor who invest on this coin is the emitter(s) who control it. and this is factually obvious: it make them billionaire on less than 6 months. (Forbes). 
So, 
Although I have no particular interest in the debate that this tweet raises concerning the subject to which it is applied (and i fell curious about the defensive behavior that it provoked), I am embarrassed by the relevance of its content for the case of the source who publishes it here (BNB related).


Objectivity: i talk about the BNB and it s emitter (the Juridical person), so, if you have any argument about that i refer you to this kind of question, where you can help: 
you agree at least that it is one of a basic and legit question for any investment decision ? so, tell me, who will invest without such basic information ? the "insiders" who already invested of course.
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:06:06
The same concept: consensus base. What change is the form,  the design, the implementations... The equivalent with flat are the physical or digital qualities that complicate counterfeiting of banknotes / bills/ balances, and there is hundred of them.  The history of wars has examples of currency attacks by massively counterfeiting them which makes them suddenly unusable.

@_date: 2018-04-29 02:56:33
Which one "unit of" you can't  counterfeit/reproduce exactly? When two parties agree at T time to transport an agreed amount of value by the mean of a "transport" unit, they base their agreement on the fact that this exact unit(s) have X unique characteristics (intrinsic ?) which are not freely reproducible. If you agree with that, you can conclude that a "cryptographic" currency is the ideal and $ (classic flat) is not a perfect currency. Of course there is a lot of other aspects to look to before conclusion, we are adressing  just one of them here.

It is a zero game. The funds come from the users, not from an accounting trick because only the blockchain has that accountant role. This is what is verified here: is there more funds lent than what they have in deposits from users? In more global sense: is there a breach of the rule that all btc in circulation are exactly the same as the valid one on the blockchain ? 
After all, we trust the blockchain and only the blockchain ledger right? Otherwise, we are not using the same language.
