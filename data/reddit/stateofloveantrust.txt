If you have ever seen an old man pushing buttons at an ATM looking confused and lost - thats me only a million times dumber. I thank you and I will google how to get a hash off a document. Thank you very much!

I thought you needed a Central Authority for a Ponzi scheme to exist. Since no Central Authority exists in the Bitcoin network wouldn't you say that even "Not a deliberate Ponzi Scheme" is misleading? I don't think its a Ponzi or a Pyramid - I think it's something no one quite understands yet - good or bad.

Thank you! I am still a bit confused though. Can you recommend an article that breaks this down? I am getting lost in the rabbit hole while trying to figure this aspect of Bitcoin out lol.

This helps a lot! Thanks!

Got it! Thank you! Is there a possibility that all these "fingerprints" could clog the blockchain or are they too small to have an impact? Does one Bitcoin get you more address space on the Blockchain vice a Satoshi?

Dude - I dig Bitcoin but I gotta say, Buttcoin comes up with some comedy classics and some epic trolls. Every time I check their site that picture of Mark Karp "IN THIS MOMENT I'M EUPHORIC." Fuckin cracks me up. It's like this - everyone has their own opinion on how this will turn out but funny is funny - I fuckin love those guys.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:33:08
I'm out!! Buttcoin was right and those guys have a sense of humor - Damn coins are locked in Coinbase's vault for 48 hours so I guess Ill sell at sub 200. It's been fun but this concept does not work!
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:55:09
Not me! I went in at an average of 600 per coin and spent 13000 total in 2014. If I were to cash out it would be a loss of about 7 grand. Gonna hold and wait for 3 years and either ride it to zero or maybe break even. Don't plan on making big bucks any time soon - have fun though!

You seem like a good dude!! I do see what your saying - I just feel people have looked at the big picture and decided while Bitcoin is a really cool technology and the Blockchain is great, it's just too clunky to process transactions on a large scale and the volatility will continue for years. I think this has lead to a basic loss in faith of the Bitcoin system. No matter how cool a technology might be/have been if it doesn't have the publics trust it is doomed to fail. (It's like an opening band for the Stones... puuuush me puuuull me) Oh dude Modest Mouse has a new album out - check it - it's dope!)

Sure if you have your triple encrypted Treznor on your hip and you can find a place that wants it and that place actually has something you want to buy. Bitcoins been around 6 years if it was going to work, if it was that great there would be an easier way to spend them let alone having to worry about them getting hacked.

It is triply some people will dedicate so much time to something they apparently don't like - I could see if Bitcoin was all powerful and ruining life. Really it's just a neat technology that may or may not one day make money a faster more enjoyable experience sort of like digital cameras did to film.

YOUR PEERS WERE LAUGHING AT DIGITAL WHEN FILM WAS KING.

Confused to why an old piece on Bitcoin would be at the top of Google News on Bitcoin.....slow news day?
@_date: 2015-10-05 11:01:14
Why is Bitcoin so boring these days?
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:09:54
I write witty shit on Buttcoin - what have you done turbo?

Why does Andreas get a pass on Neo-bee? I think he is fun to listen to and all but this sub pumps him up to be the second coming, trusts him when he does audits on Coinbase etc. but Neo-Bee? Ahhhh that don't count! I don't get it.
