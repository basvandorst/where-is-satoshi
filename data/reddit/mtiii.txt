I would consider it a victory if transfers between banks would happen 24/7. Currently it is 5 times a day (SEPA - europe). I mean what the actual fuck, last i checked it was 2018. No human is involved in the operation. Servers don't need to sleep. I give zero fucks that it will cost billions to change to a new system.
And what is up with 9-5 opening hours. I need to be at work you lazy fucks.
I hope they lose trillions of dollars and pitchforks are involved.

It buying its own debt, think about that for a second. Monetizing debt = money printing.

At least their CEO is well known, Halsey Minor.
Minor currently owes over 10.4 million dollars in taxes to the State of California which have gone unpaid since 2009. 
Minor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Los Angeles in May, 2013

Can't go very deep into negative interest rate with paper money in circulation. Cashless does not mean decentralized.

The guy is talking about a crypto revolution but can't make a decent resolution map.

Why would anyone hold their money in the bank? Deposit rate 0.22% for 3 year. 0.03% for 2 year. The risk is far greater than that. They will even eat the 2.2% inflation AND the security risk to have instant access to their savings. Goddammit, people should have to right to save the money they earn if they want to.

Look into what is happening in Argentina. None of the laws imposed to force people to use their national currency actually work. Economic activity is steadily moving into the black market. How would it be different if the same happened in US?

Do not take anything seriously from RT. It is a russian state funded propaganda channel.

That will only decrease the difficulty giving even more incentive for people to start mining in other countries. Good luck shutting down miners in China, Russia or Vietnam.
