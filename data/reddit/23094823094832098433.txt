Bitcoin is one of the most promising investments. If I was a billionaire, I would happily spend $100 million of that buying bitcoins.

So whenever some retarded piece of shit does crap like this he is "trolling"? Great way to defend anyone for doing almost anything.

Not exactly because the two networks were made under the same philosophy (to exchange information anonymously) and are used for many similar purposes.
However, I realized I'm wrong since TOR also has .onion sites, which makes it similar to I2P.

Talking about it is not the same as taking a stand. They are 100% in bed with the NSA while moralizing in public so they can keep their good guy image.
I would call it taking a stand if they mentioned NSA surveillance on their home page and search pages the way they sometimes mention Chrome or Chromebooks.

I finally own my very own 0.2 mBTC!

This is why I love I2P, where everyone is an "exit node" at little risk to themselves. Everything is self-contained and encrypted, so it cannot be determined what data an "exit node" is actually serving to a client. Of course, they are not actually exit-nodes since the network is never exited.

"Correlation" means two variables fluctuate together, in this case accepting bitcoins and stock trade price. We say that correlation does not imply causation, meaning that when two things change together, it doesn't mean there is a relationship between them.
So we have correlation, just not necessarily causation.
Saying the correlation is a nice thing but it is not correlated is an oxymoron.

Does anyone else have any more of those bits?
