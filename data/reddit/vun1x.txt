So to easily say that those keys in Desktop Wallets belong to us and no-one else ?

Blockchain analysis ?
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:02:46
Well, the stylesheet explains it all ....

Sorry I'm a bit new to Bitcoin currency and could you just expand expand and explain in more easy English the first and second point ? I'm pretty much confused about Bitcoin core and what is SPV client as well as what is an address ? You mean that long ID which you receive when you make an account or actual IP address ? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:11:15
first of all what is a blockchain to start with ?
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:15:17
Why port 9150 ? 
Doesn't Tor by default work on port 9050 ?

I want to use desktop one but can you explain to me why you don't recommend the web wallet ?
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:48:34
Damn, there's more to Bitcoin anonymity than Tor, well it's basically opposite what I have though, lol. 
P.S Do you refer to chain as IP Addresses or what ?

I'm agreeing on the stuff that you just said and I'm aware of that there are always some risks and you simply can't eliminate all of them. Also I was wondering if I should use software called TOR to minimise my tracks and if so, will it be in some percentage safe in a way that no-one from Tor network can't hijack my Bitcoin account and if it would minimise my tracks to some extent. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:10:05
What do you mean by that ?
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:43:54
I'm new to all of this so you saying that instead of using web client I should use stand alone client like Electrum with TOR ?
