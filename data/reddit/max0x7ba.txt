That adoption won't happen until you can dispute a bitcoin transaction and get your money back.

You are basically saying that _might_ doesn't mean a thing. Neither does _may_.
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:37:48
And _might_ probability is?

You send bitcoins. Them: we never got them, we got hacked.

For a prediction to be useful it must include the time horizon and an estimate of the effect. Otherwise the prediction isn't actionable nor auditable.

All you need to know is that it takes 1h for a transaction to be completed.

In UK, there is a guy who built some wind turbines, got UK government green power subsidies, and now uses all the generated energy for mining bitcoins.

Incorrect. It was a UK court ruling.

Sell your coins while you can.

And if you try to dispute a transaction you are out of luck.

Blockchain is just a glorified distributed append-only file. 
Making proof of work doesn't actually do any useful work whatsoever. Just burning the ASIC/GPU/CPU cycles and energy.

Remember Samsung updated TV firmware over the internet and bricked the TVs? 
Samsung's software is crap, IMO. 
That's the  reason I stopped using Samsung phones.
Wouldn't trust Samsung with such crucial software.

Fees for converting your currency into bitcoins, network transaction fees and merchant fees for converting coins back into currency. And higher prices because coin volatility is high.
You need to dispute transactions when the provider doesn't deliver or refuses to refund for faulty goods or services. For consumers bitcoins is a poor payment method.
Not to mention that you have to be very computer literate to be able to keep your coins secure from theft.
And if you money or coins get stuck on some exchange good luck getting them back.

On step 2 your money got stuck on the exchange because your account is unverified.

Coinbase is extremely dodgy, don't use them.
I bought bitcoins in the past through Coinbase, funding it with bank wire transfers. When later I sold bitcoins and wanted to transfer my money back into my bank account, my Coinbase account suddenly became "unverified", despite my numerous bank deposits, so that I couldn't withdraw my money. I had to buy bitcoins back, transfer to another exchange, sell them there and transfer money back into my bank account.
Coinbase responded to my emails 4 weeks later, saying that it was an error on their side. 
The representative asked me whether I was happy with the resolution. I asked them to refund me the transaction costs which I incurred due to their fault. They stopped replying to my emails.
Fuck them.

This way you incur extra fees but your transactions become slow. And you cannot dispute transactions.
