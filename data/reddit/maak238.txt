Dude... take this sentence out... it screams "insecurity".

I hate this joke.  It's posted every time there is a price drop.  I understand the person posting it thinks they came up with something original an creative.  It's not just you though... this shit gets upvoted.  Some people out there REALLY love this joke.

Beware of the Bull Trap!

I tried buying some more with them a couple days ago and they said they ran out, and to try again later. (which I did, and I bought more)

I used blockchain and coinbase for my wallets.  I used this subreddit, related wikis, and a few other sites here and there to learn how the system works.
Finally climbing the learning curve, there's no way I'm spending!  I think after a few months of accumulating, the novelty will wear off and I'll consider spending.

I think this is the concept I need to grasp.  (How can a program generate these pairings, have them be related enough where they can be verified, but not where they can be reverse engineered?)  I printed off some articles, and I'm going read them in a recliner tonight.  Thank you.

I am one of these noobs.
I got set up with coinbase.  But I was told that place sucked and to get my BTC out of there.  I made a wallet at blockchain with my 30 character random password.  But I was told that blockchain sucked and only offline paper wallets were good.  How am I supposed to spend BTC from an offline paper wallet?!  If I'm not at coinbase, then how do I buy/sell?
So I buy with coinbase, send it immediately to blockchain, spend from there with my crazy 30 character password every time I want to buy something, even if only a dollar, but I should send any significant amount of money to a paper wallet?  I don't get how the paper wallet works, I just make up my own address?
That's where I'm at.  I read faqs and search reddit and google.  If someone wants to scam me, I'm probably vulnerable.

Any evidence or support for this?  The top commenters and stories on Reddit are from DIFFERENT people.  I understand why you perceive it that way...  On bullish news days, the bulls make the front page... on bearish days the bears make the front page.
Remember, these may well be DIFFERENT people!

I think the thing I'm not getting is this:  If I use bitaddress.org offline, and create a randomly created bitcoin address and private key, how does the "bitcoin network" know that my private key belongs to that address?
Does that question make sense?

No...  I have no interest in SPENDING BTC... I'd be interested in a card where each transaction converts 1% of what I spend in to BTC for ME.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:49:49
After all the effort it took for me to acquire my bitcoins... no way I'm going to spend them :P
