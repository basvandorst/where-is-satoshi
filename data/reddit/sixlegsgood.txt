Sorry, I can't give any links as am away from a decent internet connection. However, all X applications have an amazing amount of shared information, going as far as reading the contents of all windows and intercepting/adding X events. Root is not needed. 
Clipboard attacks can also be browser-based, as some browsers allow JavaScript to *read* the clipboard as well as write to it.

Yes, that's why they are asking why we never hear about the other side, the "I bought bitcoins at a 30% markup and it was GREAT!" people. Where are they?

There is malware out there that monitors and attacks your clipboard, doing stuff like reading private keys and replacing Bitcoin addresses. Your setup is still at risk, the VMs do not need to be touched for the malware to hit you.

Many newbie bitcoin speculators might never amount to a single transaction on the blockchain. They buy coins on Coinbase, which just results in a new entry in Coinbase's database. Later on they sell them, again causing a DB update. But none of these are actual bitcoin transactions.
They could be buying and selling anything, it has the same impact on bitcoin's blockchain, i.e. nothing at all.

'General consensus' ? How does that work then, are we meant to vote for it?
Besides which, why is it so obvious that it should follow one side? Imagine bitcoin forks into A+B, and the value divides up roughly evenly. Why should the future contract pick side A or side B instead of A+B? If it's unclear in advance what the contract will do, how can anyone reliably use it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:10:55
This still doesn't answer the original question. If bitcoin forks, how will this be reflected in the futures pricing? Should the future price be  fork A + fork B, or just fork A?

So *when* do you buy? Bitcoin is going to be deflationary for a very long time. What's the point of having coins if you don't use them?

AFAIK, there's never been a post on here saying 'Wow! Purse.io is great, I bought some bitcoins on there for only 30% over the market price.'
The fact is, purse.io is suspiciously one-sided. If there are these supposedly good reasons for buying bitcoins with it, why do we never ever hear from these buyers?

This is nothing new. Betfair introduced 0% edge games like roulette and blackjack years ago when they first opened a casino section on their site. They didn't set the gambling world on fire. 0% bitcoin games won't either.
Casinos and other mug betting is all about marketing. The players aren't too concerned about edge, if they were then they wouldn't be playing at all, 0%, 1% or whatever% edge!
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:20:48
Online casino games with a 0% edge have been available for many years, it has nothing to do with bitcoin.

From your recommended 'Best Bitcoin Sportsbooks':
* CloudBet: [5.1.5. You authorize us to use any means that we consider necessary to verify your identity](
* Nitrogen Sports: [Nitrogen Sports reserves the right to request valid proof of identification from all players.](
* Jetwin: [The Company has the right to require the Customer to submit valid proof of identity to verify the Customer's age.](
These companies might well be happy to take your money without asking for even an email address, but you can be sure that they will start applying the T&amp;Cs once they might have to pay you out more than a token amount of winnings. You are naive if you think otherwise.
Further, any online gambling company is breaking the law if they don't attempt any kind of identity check *before* signing you up. **Every** jurisdiction where gambling is legal has minimum age limits, and companies are absolutely required to enforce these requirements. A company that is operating illegally is blatantly a shady and untrustworthy one, if they aren't following the rules in one area, they probably can't be trusted in other ways. So, don't be surprised if you lose your money betting with them, and please do everyone else a favor by not recommending them to others.
TL;DR: your site is recommending rip-off companies. Stop it.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:36:53
OP, why does your blog keep on claiming that an advantage with all these Bitcoin bookies is that you can "bet anonymously" ?
I've just had a look through several of the site's terms &amp; conditions, and they all specifically say that they can withhold payments until you provide them with your full identity.
Good luck getting paid out if you open an 'anonymous' account and then try to cash out a big win!
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:00:00
Well done for dodging the answer, where I showed that Nitrogen does not operate on customer anonymity. Never mind all your huffing and puffing about 'find some reliable Nitrogen customers', a better question would be to try and find the actual owners of Nitrogen. Their website doesn't appear to list their registered company name or address. All they admit to is being apparently somewhere in Costa Rica. Good luck demanding your money from them if/when things turn bad.

Online bookies like Betfair had 0% edge casino games, years ago. There's nothing new in this space.
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:03:54
So was I. Betfair added several 0% margin games to their casino, variants of roulette, blackjack, etc. It was not player to player, but the traditional player vs casino.

That article is indirectly referring to Earl Thompson's paper studying the futures markets for tulips (there were a few recent articles detailing this paper, but I can't find the links right now. The [Wikipedia article]( has a good summary. But it cannot be used to completely dismiss Mackay's Madness of Crowds writings, since his book has many references to common people speculating in tulip prices and they were certainly not buying and selling futures contracts.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:24:45
Read the article, and you'll see that the title is incorrect; the tulip craze certainly did happen. There's plenty of documentary evidence.
What the article is stating is that 'tulipmania' did not result in the *wholesale destruction of the economy* (as the article puts it). It also did not result in *the collapse of industry in Amsterdam and elsewhere* (again, as the article quotes it). Saying *the tulip craze never happened* is bullshit.
But these are all insane extremes, strawmen for both sides.
There's plenty of evidence and records of ordinary people caught up in the craze of tulip prices, read the tulip chapter from the book [Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]( for actual stories and recorded events from the time. (n.b. the article also cites this book!)
The point is, there are bubbles and scams of all sizes, and they don't lead to economic destruction of countries ([here's a report of a $7.6bn scam in China only last year]( - but that doesn't mean you can say "they never happened". Many people's lives were ruined, don't try to rewrite history.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:26:10
The book also contains anecdotes, of course, and if you want me or anyone to try to find sources for the contents of a sailor's sandwiches, then, shock horror, you'll find no-one to prove it. But to dismiss everything in the chapter is to close your eyes, put your hands over your ears and pretend it all away.
The records for ancient tulip bulb sales are not surprisingly incomplete, the records that exist consist mainly for wholesale tulip bulb trading where there is less likely to be evidence of the mania of the common 'get rich quick' investor who risked more than they could and lost it all. I can't criticise Garber's work on price analysis, but it is one part of the picture and does not magically invalidate the plentiful citations of crazy buying and selling. Once again, you are picking and choosing your sources and being unwilling to accept any others.
All I am saying is that we have two extremes here and there is credible evidence not to dismiss the existence of a tulip bulb mania. We certainly can't say that the tulip mania ruined a country's economy, nor can we say it never happened.
But do carry on posting on reddit with "You're completely wrong and have no idea what you're talking about", it's what this place is all about.

Again, to quote the OP... "All the power rests with the users". Sure, I guess that miners must have whatever's left after that then? :)
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:23:32
*Vinny Lingham, Erik Vorhees, Barry Silbert &amp; co are a serious threat to bitcoin due to their utter and complete cluelesness combined with significant power as leaders of big bitcoin businesses.*
But you just said that businesses don't have any power? Make your mind up!

Now you're contradicting yourself again and claiming that miners have power too. Otherwise, it would be pointless for anyone to team up with them.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:39:40
Then you missed the point of the article. Sure, the average fee is high but there are very low cost providers out there. The article mentions these by name and yet you are still refusing to see them. 
Besides which, the story notes that many people ignore the cheaper options out there, despite them being available. This is doubly worrying for a bit-coin entrant. Even if you compete on price, most people won't care...

As I said, you need some form of proof of age to prevent minors from betting. I'm pro gambling, but definitely against underage gambling. The side effect of this is that you can't easily prove your age without revealing your identity. So while I'm not against anonymity, in this situation it is unfortunately unavoidable...
...and if the sportsbook doesn't care about accepting bets from minors, then they are scum and should be stopped.

@_date: 2015-11-15 17:28:54
Direct bank deposits should never take four months. That length of time is not a technical failing of the banking system, it's a deliberate delay by the sportsbook (or perhaps incompetence, but that's not very reassuring).
So if the bookie is delaying withdrawals by choice, why would you expect bitcoin withdrawals to be any faster?
@_date: 2015-11-15 17:26:37
Any reputable sportsbook will need you to register. Even in jurisdictions that allow gambling, no-one allows underage betting. So you need some proof of ID before taking a bet. If you really want to support shady, unethical gambling companies, then go with the anonymous ones, but perhaps you should question your morals.

Couldn't RBF be made to only allow replacement transactions if the recipients stay the same? This would prevent it from being used to double spend, since you can't send the money to someone else.

If what you say is true, it implies that a mere 1% of miners can force whatever changes they want onto bitcoin. Surely that's a terrible security problem? You may agree with the UASF, but what about further forks? Imagine that 1% of the miners decide to increase the supply of coins? From your logic, it follows that they could easily do this.
