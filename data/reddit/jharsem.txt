Hey - was this a photoshop conversion or did you draw the wizard - it's an epic wizard =) ..

That is interesting - I am waiting for 4 of the little 5+GH/s for a while now and I am unlikely to get them before they are anything but a distant footnote in the general network hashing power - at this stage bankrupting them via class action sounds like a sensible move - even if it means we only get cents to the dollar. 
At least no-one else will get burned.

Yep, I did hear about the initial delays, except im pretty sure the website did suggest that the product was in stock, I did take a copy of the website product page at the time which i'll have to dig up - I'm fairly certain it showed product in stock and no obvious indication that what you were buying was a position in the production queue while BFL was filling its massive backlog. They marked the product as sold out the next day. 
If your point is that 'you knew they are a shitty company and you chose to do business with them' I sort of fail to see that as some sort positive mitigating factor as to their business practices?
I should also say that seeing i'm not a lawyer, the real proof of wrong doing is obviously not someone being pissed off about them.

I am 100% in agreement here - I am also outside of the US but as it seems the issues raised by (and arguable released by) Snowden appear to affect us all. So in that sense, to me at least, it's a good topic. The toxic nature of the money is a public sentiment that is well understood. 
Having said that producing an iconic image is good but it needs a bit of marketing to really "hit home" outside of the reddit community. Ie. The final artwork ought to be printed large, photographed, submitted to magazines, made available via creative commons etc - ie. anything to get it to be as *iconic* as we can make it.  =)

There are many many people on YouTube that have excellent (much better than my skills) drawing videos. 
Mind you, I'm happy to set up a ustream in a week or so when I have moved my larger Drawing tablet to work - that way you could actually see a few different approaches, ask a few questions etc - Ping me once this contest is over :)

Wooo! Many thanks - It is coming along =). For the record this is being drawn on a Surface Pro /w the Stylus in Manga Studio (an awesome cartooning/drawing app - significantly cheaper than Photoshop).

In the spirit of "show your working" here is a progress picture.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:50:31
Most definitely will - the journey will be as much fun as the result. Thank you for the tip =) .. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:57:45
Oh I'll give this a shot!

Another progress report :)  For neatness I have now stuck up the screenies in an album at imgur and will update the album (and this thread) as time progresses.

Hehe thanks - I've only very recently gotten into the bitcoin (kicking myself of course), but been illustrating/cartooning for a little while now. Used to submit cartoons to the LinuxGazette a long while back. 
I haven't got any time lapse screenshot software installed on the surface pro, probably a bit late now seeing the visually more interesting (IMHO) sketching and inking parts are mostly over. Mind you if there is interest I can always re-create the character in a different pose (perhaps more kick arse, less bunny slippers :)) and see if I can record that.
