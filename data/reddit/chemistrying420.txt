I have a strong feeling that bitcoin will go up. No reasons or anything I just feel that it will

Just make sure to not share the private key (under the hologram)

Exactly lol. People love to shit on his inheritance. Last time I checked, he didn't inherit 8 billion dollars. Not even a billion dollars. How many people even double their money through business ventures?

What'd he do to scam people?

A source would be nice though

It's too hard

Taken from the article. "Nobody believes there is $20 worth of paper and ink in a $20 bill, but we agree to let those green things with Andrew Jackson’s face on them serve as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Unlike actual money, however, bitcoin isn’t dependent on a government for its value ― it’s worth whatever people will buy and sell it for." 
So he's saying that people agree that a $20 does not have $20 worth of value and instead serves as a store of value since we agree on it? Then goes on to shit on bitcoin since its worth what people buy it and sell it for. 
I'll take my bitcoin. But thanks for the advice bro

Slavery, genocide, and poverty pretty much describe all the worst parts about world history for the past thousands of years. I'm not saying that we shouldn't do all we can to make the world a better place. But we shouldn't act like the world has made no advancements and is constantly getting worse.

An acceleration in decline would mean climate change is changing less by the day no?

Oh that's weird. I never had to do anything going from coinbase to gdax

I mean he is kinda right since the Jewish religion allows loaning money at interest while the Muslim religion does not. That has made them pretty powerful and useful over history.

I couldn't read anymore after he cited Jamie Dimon

Or maybe it's because this created financial world is outdated and confusing to young adults like me. 
And typically young adults adopt technology the best. 
Now introduce a system to safely store your money using no one but yourself? It's a no brainer.
I don't need a mortgage right now and saving accounts interest rates are awful. Fuck banks
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:12
I wish I could ask him what's gonna happen when people start to realize that $20 may not be worth $20 anymore hahahaha

Compared to the world 100 years ago, I'd say we're doing pretty good.

If you already have coinbase set up then no. Just log right in to gdax

Exactly. We definitely hear about a lot more shit though. That can give a big false perception.

I sold a high end mountain bike when I was 17. Created a PayPal to accepting the money. And of course PayPal decided to tell me I wasn't old enough and locked my account when I received the 3k for the bike. It was a huge pain in the ass to get that money back.
