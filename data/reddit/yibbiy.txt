Questions: 
- Do most people have Bitcoins in the area? 
- Is the pharmacy going to hold onto the Bitcoin?  Or better yet, pay their employees and suppliers in BTC earned?
- Are the prices still going to fluctuate based on USD/BTC pair?  If so which exchange value is going to be used? 
- Would any merchant price their goods/services in a fixed amount of BTC?  
Thanks :)

correct.  the problem is bitcoin needs continued life stream (miners and their hash rate) to stay relevant and alive.

Taking the other side of the coin, maybe BTC is already at it's fair market value and people with lots of BTC are looking to diversify to something else?  Equally viable and with more upside?
Downfall of BTC IMHO started with arms race of ASIC miners. 
and the long verification time.

I wish I could, but when I asked around, people missed the boat, and no one I spoke to is interested to support the 1% hoarding 80% of the BTC wealth.  
Of course they are people who asked about BTC, but they are treating BTC like penny stock (will it go to $100k? Is it a good investment?) - and they definitely will not be spending BTC at local farmers market any time soon.

there are bitcoiners pumping DOGE right now.  look at the volume of the DOGE/BTC pair.
I am not sure if it's genuine diversification or pump and dump. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:37:31
without BTC, there is no DOGE.
Sorry to say this, DOGE smells like BTC v.2  
- don't need to go to mBTC, it's easier to transact in whole number
- 1 min per block, faster processing time
- scrypt &gt; sha256
- small guys have a chance to participate and learn about crypto : hence network effect is building up rapidly
- no ASIC (yet)

BTC can also be confiscated by means of:
- confiscating your computer
- confiscating your cold storage/paper wallet.
- and it can be hacked (and you cannot hack gold) 
Same thing. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:35:37
it's true, and that's the hurdle DOGE community will have to overcome.
In all fairness, merchants who accept BTC would have no problem accepting DOGE at the rate DOGE is going - popularity and awareness (unless you guys decided to invest a few BTC to destroy DOGE by pumping and dumping so people lose faith).  Now the question is where will DOGE price settle.  The more stable the price the better it is as a currency.

Mining got too difficult, if there is no way I can generate BTC with my machine without breaking the bank, I don't see a reason why I would be spending BTC since I don't have a lot to spend on. 
I am not going to be converting my hard earned fiat to BTC just to spend at merchants who also accepts cash/credit/debit (without no volatility), when I don't know how much the BTC could buy me.
It is just an unnecessary and inconvenient step that I have to take to go all the way to support BTC. 
If there is still a feasible way to use my everyday computer to get some BTC, I would sure spend it. 
To me, BTC is not attractive anymore since I am not into speculation game (I will leave that up to wall street), and the technical chart looks like it is going to go down - unless of course those top 1% jump in to prop up the price, but that would further add to the BTC wealth concentration problem.
just my 2 cents.

I think Doge community can become success is not only the fun atmosphere, but due to lack of ASIC (fingers crossed) it is more inclusive and the masses can join the mining fun.
Can people new to crypto-currency participate in BTC with no addition capital outlay?  I don't think so. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 01:13:04
Totally.   If you sold at $650, let it collapse more and buy back?  Win/Win!

The issue is people cannot spend BTC if they don't have it. 
After ASIC was introduced, and the ever delayed shipment and exponential increase in hash rate (and difficulty), I am long priced out of the game.
BTC is no longer for the people, it is the new plaything for the elites and ultra wealthy (and those lucky few who got in super early and able to keep up). 
Sad fact. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 01:15:13
BTC is no longer decentralized... mining pools / corporations control the new BTC, and we are at their mercy to not conduct the 51% attack.  Coins are concentrated among the rich and powerful.  Time to move on.

They need to list all fees under 1 page. 
Right now only trade fee is listed prominently, everything else are hard to find.

Gold &gt; BTC
- BTC needs to be backed by electricity, internet, and hashing power.  Gold doesn't

BTC/USD looks very bearish now. 
I don't think Fed is going to be selling into the market via exchange where the market price is established, so it shouldn't move the price.  Fed would be auctioning it to "investors", a.k.a. hoarders, who expect the price to go to the moon - but such concentration is not healthy for Bitcoin as a currency. 
Business coming onboard accepting Bitcoin is the necessary step to showcase the utility and legitimize value of BTC, but the issue now is companies like Overstock.com converts BTC to fiat immediately after a sale.  It puts downward pressure to the currency price (don't know if it offsets by getting more people onboard and interested in BTC, but I fail to see why you would buy BTC to spend when credit card option is available unless you already own BTC - which means you are unloading and getting out - or spreading the "wealth" if you prefer) 
ASIC mining equipments pretty much cut the mass out of participating in BTC and concentrating the hashing power to those who have deep pockets. 
So I am still trying to understand the reason why an average person would genuinely want to use BTC as a currency, and not a speculative investment, at this point if they have missed the boat already. 
Why would an average person want to support to top 1% holding 80% of BTC wealth? 
I can only think BTC is good for:
- international money movement (bypassing legal issue)
- speculation 
- selling and lock in the gains (if you are the minority who got BTC early)
@_date: 2014-01-17 05:15:09
Are people actually using it? 
I hope bars and businesses give a better price when being paid in BTC :)

That's the creation of gold, once mined, they don't need those upkeep.
