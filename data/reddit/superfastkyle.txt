When you realize the logistics of what he's saying you realize more likely this is nothing but a lie to buy more time. They would have to buy btc, sell ETH and sell etc. But yet they don't know how much they will be able to buy or sell for.

Why do people spread such bull like this. User's aren't going to get any money, just like every other hack before. Its an inside job all our money is gone. Exchanges will continue to steal money from us until people are held responsible for their actions.

I'm too worried to use adblock. I turn it off when using crypto. The developer could get their web store account hacked and put a fake version that changes your receive addresses. Everything updates automatically these days, how would you know before its too late?

Not only does this make me want to stop all business with them. When you have a system that cannot handle current traffic why would you add more assets to it? That's just straight up greed! I don't know how they can think they won't be sued over this

The whole reason Ron Paul didn't have a chance was because of shit being spread about him by the media. The same thing that is happening to bitcoin. Yes internet polls and comments are far from "scientific" but there were far more people who liked him then your comment suggest.

Yeah "everybody" knew something was wrong with mtgox that's why they still had 850,000 bitcoins when they shutdown. You can say the same thing about bitcoinica, cryptsy, pirate40, butterfly labs as well. They all had signs just like tether has signs. Just like bitfinex already got hacked once

I don't know why you call it a good business with FPGA. Right now there are what about 10 known mini rigs in the wild and maybe 200-300 singles. They were most likely using used chips for their devices as well, the chips were $600 new of which there are two per single. When they ran out of cheap used chips. They probably have no way of ever fulfilling their fpga orders without using the money coming in for asic. Hence why they have the trade in program. Here shortly when the asic orders slow down they will ask for your fpga to be sent in for trade. They will then pass that on to the next guy so they still look legit. But eventually it will all come to a halt as the asic are perpetually delayed

OP is a troll. Why are you responding to him? The reason he says prove me wrong is because there is no absolute truth for believing in Austrian economics but is believing "facts" from keysian theory as being absolute truth.  Just read his posting history.  He probably works for one of the big banks, who love robbing anyone who doesnt believe in a lifetime of debt dry.

If deflation is bad because people are unable to pay back their loans. Isn't inflation bad for the same reasons. People aren't able to pay back their loans either way, so credit issuers will send their bad debt to collection agencies for pennies on the dollar, in a way creating inflation again. But this time instead of multi billion dollar national banks getting the inflation like it is now it will go to the people. So deflation although it may have some downsides, wouldn't it resolve itself? Inflation on the other hand would just continue until total collapse. Because you will loan out an infinite amount of money if you know you can't lose

Another great example of energy standards is tv's. Most tv's are energy star rated these days, in fact I have a plasma rated with a supposed $20 a year electricity usage. But when you make the tv actually usable, not dark or grainy by turning off the energy saving features it can use anywhere between 450-600 watts as measured by a kilawatt

I've been using bitinstant to paypal and using paypal debit card for transactions that can't wait. It works ok, fees are high though 6%. You do get 1% cash back if you use the card without a pin though. Still way cheaper than btcpak was though 13% or more

@_date: 2012-09-09 22:54:35
It seems to me that bitcointalk is just not proactive enough in trying to eliminate some of the scamming taking place there. After not giving scammer tags to the people related with Bitcoinica, and hero users misinterpreting contracts to benefit themselves. This is not the first time this has happened, I'm only surprised I don't see other hero members sticking up for Matthew like the others

totally agree why would you buy all the equipment, cost of installation, hire someone who knows how to program those machines when you may have the bitcoin mining market saturated in a few months. it makes way more sense to outsource the work
@_date: 2012-10-19 19:52:12
It is a stupid law, yes. Will it effect anyone? Hardly. The only thing will happen is card manufacturers will start shipping there cards with lower stock voltages and clocks. That's it. Even if you have to turn on some super secret unsupported no warranty overclock mode, performance will end up the same. In fact it may increase performance by causing better binned chips to be used

I remember back when Bitcoin was $4 and with my almost 1000btc it looked like child's play as well at that time to manipulate the market even then with that small amount. Well guess what its not. Just because the order book says one thing doesn't mean you can trigger a panic buy/sell all by yourself. Its more likely to rebound and you just lost money. There are several people by now with a million dollar holding of Bitcoin by now.I'm sure its not easy, and if it was the market adapts and it stops being easy

The possibility of another site scamming is more than just an open site, take orders and run with the money. You likely wouldn't get much that way. The long con would be much more profitiable. Satoshidice already has a reputation of not skimming. And also people know how to use it easily which is worth something as well

Is this the same guy "immerse" who got me. He still has perfect feedback but bitmit wouldn't help me and neither would the seller.

Not really I would buy anything from Amazon/Newegg with no option of a chargeback to save 2%. Donating money to a non-profit or buying a new mp3 download or an Android App, no escrow needed there either. Buying computer hardware from BFL, Kncminer, or Bitmit, yes I would want an escrow service on top of bitcoin

Walt is going to go to his house, get the ricin, poison Todd and his gang with it. Probably using their own product to do it, IE poison a batch of meth with it, which then might get distributed at large. Jesse will end up being safe but there will be no reconciliation with him and Walt. Walt will somehow get the money to his family. Maybe by threatening or coercing his former business partner to  launder the money and give it to his family. Walt dies from the cancer after he realizes he meth empire is finished and his family wants nothing to do with him.

I think its funny how he says he would pay off the national debt. This is probably the worst possible thing he could do. If this was actually possible it would flood the market, especially the Chinese market with cheap dollars and massive inflation would result

Use scare tactics. "Warning", "Don't move your coins", "fork created", etc. Then one hour later "Nothing to worry about just a few orphaned blocks" "issue resolved itself". Sell then buy back in. Its obvious to me this was intentionally done to increase bitcoin holdings for certain people.

Exactly I don't pretend to be a software engineer. Just a computer geek like most of us, who has happened to do simple programming enough to understand simple programming terms. The wording chosen and the way it was displayed in red at the top of the forum like a big huge warning was purposely done to cause panic. You probably wouldn't know any better unless you knew about the mechanics of the software itself. The crash stopped almost the minute the announcement post was edited. Which most of us didn't notice until the price had returned to pre-crash levels

so is having a btc/usd exchange reinforcing the us dollar monopoly? A bitcoin credit card will be a good thing. Let the market decide what it wants. If bitcoin gets wide acceptance the btc credit card will fade away, because people will be unwilling to pay the fees.

Yes the cost on the invoice you receive is total cost. Say you ask for $200, your invoice will be $203.95 you will receive $200 - the 3.99% fee. So approximately $192 for your $204 dollars. Hope that helps

From further research I found that, there are two ways to initiate a ACH through a ODFI and through a third party which goes through a OFDI. That is why there is a difference of times/priorities. Coinbase when I signed up showed the next day which makes me assume they are processing directly to an ODFI. Basically this million dolllar plus bond they talk about requiring bitcoin companies to hold as a money transmitter seems to be to create this monopoly for ACH and other debit transactions. So that you yourself cannot start a transfer without a middleman
@_date: 2013-03-17 21:15:16
Everytime I have tried, I've made less than $5 profit for usually about 15 minutes of work. Using less than $200 anyways There is always the possibility still of a loss in that 15 minutes either by trading. Or by going through a less than reputable 3rd party.
@_date: 2013-03-14 22:18:50
So why do you care about bitcoin then? At this time no law enforcement is going to care whether you get what product or service you pay for with bitcoin. But yet people still provide products and services. The idea that every insurance company is some kind of special business which cares nothing for its consumer is ridiculous. Try buying some car insurance from the $25 local place that advertises on street corners and then try state farm there is a huge difference. All businesses of any type are not "evil"

Exactly. At my work the ACH is a posted wednesday for a friday payday. I don't know if there is a cheaper way to send an ach like a low priority but Dwolla sent it the same priority as my work. It was clockwork. Dwolla by 3PM on a buisness day, deposited by 3AM next business day in my "bank account" (actually credit card only no bank account). Fastcashforbitcoins listed a low and high priority ach when they were around so maybe that is the case.
