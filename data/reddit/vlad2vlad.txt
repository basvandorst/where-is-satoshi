I actually wanted to know the status with sidechains in that particular post.
But in general I just like to mess with the r/BTC sub cause it looks to me like they have paid trolls following a script so it's just fun to mess with them.  Not a good idea?  lol
R/BTCfork banned me after 1 single post and I wasn't even rude so that tells you a lot.

@_date: 2016-08-01 20:49:22
I think that's why they did the whole DAO hack scheme.  To work out the bugs.  Imagine major exchanges leaking bitcoins like they're leaking ETC.  it would bankrupt all of them.  
And they won't get community consent, it's gonna be ugly but with ETC going to $1 billion they'll argue it's a win-win so they'll get community support for their short chain.
The new PoW algo should be interesting, there's no way they're gonna stay open to an attack.

That scenario is very possible.  I also see one if not both ETH/ETC forks dying but not until after the Bitcoin Hardfork.  And they'll definitely add PoS to one of the Bitcoin forks.  I'm curious how they're gonna pull that off without removing the hardcap.  Or maybe they'll just start inflating.  If people make money they won't care - ETH/ETC proved that.  Sad.

What a great pic.  What exactly happened, I don't get it?  The price rally was killed by a profit taking I think.  Institutional money dumped cause they know they still have another month before the halvening hype really starts.  That's my guess.
@_date: 2016-04-15 08:11:58
one more question Paul:  how would one determine the value of a sidechain?  You can't just simply do something like a 1:1 pegged value.  Wouldn't those involved in Bitcoin have to agree on a pegged value?  Assuming we're talking about a Bitcoin twin with 21 million hard limit.  I imagine lots of politics would then come into play. 
Thanks again!

It's not just the big blocks, although that's a part of it.  If Gavin gets XT then the Chinese who controls the Bitcoin network will be blacklisted.  Smaller blocks also help the Chinese cause it forces Gavin/Bitcoin to use sidechains where the Chinese can then introduce their own alternative to Bitcoin.
This is why XT will never happen as long as the Chinese have 51%+ of the network.

@_date: 2014-12-24 19:57:45
The $3,000 cap loss limit per year is against ordinary income, correct?
I didn't think that was stated very clearly.
So you deduct the Max cap losses for the year for all your cap gains and then if there are losses left over or carried over you can deduct an additional $3,000 cap loss against your ordinary income.
And you can do this every year until your cap loss carry-forward has been exhausted 
This is how I understand it.
Thanks for your input, I learned some new stuff - like I didn't know crypto currencies qualified for the much lower long term cap gains rule which apply to stocks.
20% tax hit instead of 45% is awesome and worth holding for 12+ months.

Because there are banks and hedge funds lined to get those Bitcoins.
And they will get them.
Bitcoin will be majority owned by banks and hedge funds in the next 12 months.

Exactly what I've been saying but the sheep are too far gone.  They really don't see what's really happening here.  It's a trap, and bitcoin is the carrot, the bait and switch.  The switch will be a different currency where the early adopters are THEM, not the sheep.
Cryptos, as designed, are nothing more than a fiat built as a global asset tracker.  No more freedom, the age of enslavement has come.  Change will be delivered to the sheep as promised in 2008.

Just weeks ago you said the state and banks can NEVER control bitcoin and now you're already starting to sing a different tune.

Thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:05:15
Yeah, it's starting to look like the elite are gonna own and run Bitcoin.
Precisely as I predicted last year.  It was fun while it lasted.  Now make a few million and bail.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:44:35
Just like now, mining gear was going cheaper than new, coins were getting killed, most down over 90% with BTC around $140. Then it moved quickly to $200, and after it broke $300 a week later or so it blasted off.
There was nothing to make you think it's gonna hit $1242.
But the guy saying everyone was off by years is wrong. I started a thread saying Bitcoin would match Gold within 12 months just 3 months earlier and it happened well within my timeline.
I would say we're 1-2 months before the next big run and this one will be more sustained due to so much SmartMoney now controlling Bitcoin (and the news).
I expect $2,500+ in the second half this year and at least $10,000 next year due to multiple ETFs going live end of this year.
I also called the ETFs last year when everyone thought that was impossible.
You know, cause idiots like Andreas Antonopolous said Banks hate Bitcoin.
Haha, that one is still funny.
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:13:27
What's more revolutionary than an alt which can do exactly what Bitcoin does, RIGHT NOW!
Any innovation is copy and paste, it means nothing. People are really stupid paying $14 for darkcoin when I can copy and paste their everything onto ShitCoin, with ease.
Look for real advantages you idiots, which is not copy and paste features.
Deep and wide distribution, time tested and ultra secure are real advantages which maybe 2 or 3 coins in the world have.

Major Flaws in his Conclusion.
He is only modeling for velocity.
He is leaving out:
-  Bitcoin ETF - Influx of hundreds of billions starting NEXT year.
-  Country Adoption and Reserve Purchases also starting next year - 2015.
-  Massive inflation [starting next year]
That said, Bitcoin should reach $1 million [nominal] within the next 3 years.
That means bit-dollar parity: $1 = 1 bit
Today Bitcoin is ~$600 and $1 buys you nearly 1,700 bits.

Can you do that with the most likely candidates to hi-jack a bitcoin clone to combat Bitcoin's tech.  The most obvious would be Western Union which will be obsolete in 1-2 years.  
They won't lose billions per year of easy money without a fight and Amazon and Google proved nobody will adopt a NameBrand coin especially not a banker-type coin. 
So that means they have to cleverly use an existing, proven and ultra secure coin.
And which clone will they most likely back or [stealth] hi-jack?  
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:54:12
You wanna spend Bitcoins you bought?  Why?  
Invest them and you'll make 10-fold in under 6 months.  Lots of dirt cheap alt-coins right now which will pop when BTC jumps to $2,000 in the next few months.

That ~$8,000 original investment in iXcoin [via 65 Bitcoins] was worth ~$300,000 in Nov-Dec but I didn't sell a single coin so it's now worth like ~$20,000 or so.
Been buying a few BTC lately but overall this latest downturn has sucked.

I was working at PetsMart restocking puppy chow and I gave it all up and now make $10,000 per month trading Bitcoin.
Started small, bought nearly 100 BTC last year, from $50 to $130 with most of my paychecks and when bitcoin jumped to $1200 I was set, I had enough to trade with.  Making 10% returns trading Bitcoin has been easy as most months you can make 30% so during bad months, like right now you can just sit back and go on vacation.
No more puppy chow for me; 2 inch Ribeyes all the way.

The CEO of bitcoin wrote this letter?  Didn't he commit suicide?
Lol, seriously, none of this will stop the ousting of more BTC board members.  After Shrem was ousted I said they would keep stealing board seats.  It's obvious who is doing this and two-bit is obviously just another agent troll.
So be ready, count them up, how many more board seats will be forcefully vacated in the next 30-60 days.  As I said last month, the fed and banks will own Bitcoin by Christmas [or much sooner].
Nothing can stop them!

Silly goose:  China and Russia are simply gaming bitcoin cause they are secretly accumulating and hoarding it.  As are banks, Wall Street, MultiNationals and other Governments.  
Be smart and wait for capitulation [sub $400] then buy all you can. But not from Coinbase cause they're hoarding them for Marc Andresseen and his buddies as evident by constant shortages and no Bitcoin stock even though there's evident dumping.
Good luck!

And they will charge fees.  The blockchain will become so large that you'll need a data center to secure it (mine it). That's when they'll take over and they'll have a monopoly.  
If you think you can hang with them they'll just charge zero fees for a few years and put all the miners out of business.
These coins were designed to give all the advantages to the rich and powerful.  It's unreal that educated people still can't see this so late in the game.
Cause once mining subsidy drops lower or to zero you'll need massive hash power which means huge electricity costs to mine BTC for the fees which means if they do zero fees for just 1 year they'll bankrupt all the private miners.
This is another reason they'll want to adopt iXcoin. It's identical to BTC but mining stops next year.  
And it's silly to think they'll fork BTC when they'll hi-jack the board as they are doing now and control it without all you laughing sheep knowing about it.  
It's already in process. 2 board seats in 28 days and more to come in 30 days.  Keep laughing sheep, they'll imprison you all inside the blockchain.
Stop listening to engineers about future events, economics and geo-politics; they're clueless.  And I really like Andreas but he's dead wrong about this stuff.

For all we know some guy had his laptop stolen with bitcoins or maybe even killed or kidnapped and this could be some methhead dunce trying to steal the guy's bitcoins but can't get professional help cause they'll ask too many questions.
So he comes on reddit, and sure enough, hundreds of clowns jumping up and down cause it's a woman.
Tell me, if this were a male widow, wouldn't you have asked some questions and been a bit suspicious?
This exactly why JP Morgan and the NSA are in the midst of hi-jacking bitcoin and none of you see it.

How foolish.  Once the govt completely takes Bitcoin over they will make it closed source which will allow for total election fraud and also for complete ease of asset confiscations.

Why would they do that when they're 30 days away from owning and controlling the Bitcoin foundation?
Lol, the fact you guys can't see they got 2 board seats in 28 days means you'll have no idea when they get 2 more seats in the next 30-60 days which is majority vote:  Check Mate.
You guys keep talking about clouds and fairy tales while they're controlling the game and you're all totally clueless.
Wall Street is here and taking over bitcoin, without a hard fork, and without all you sheep realizing it will prove a piece of cake.

Here it is got the 10th time and the last 6 months:
China and Russia have been heavily accumulating and hoarding (not dumping) Bitcoin since last year.
They're just about out of excuses to [fake] ban Bitcoin.  Russia may start but it's looking to me like there's few sellers left at this point.
Probably one last run for $350 and then we should start our run to $2,000+ which should be reached later this year, and much higher next year via forced feedings from pension funds via public ETFs.
The same ETFs I said were a done deal last yrar just to be called crazy.
Buy BTC and buy select alts which are already being accumulated by hedge funds and HOLD.  Massive boom which will dwarf the boom on Nov is coming.
Good luck.

Coinbase didn't run out of coins.  Their owners, billionaire Venture Capitalists [Andresseen and Horrowitz] are buying the bulk for themselves and their associates.  
I think that's a very good guess why Coinbase seems to be running out of coins at a time when the masses are panicking and dumping.  
There's a reason they put a limit of $3,000 per day; it was cause they planned to stock up on Bitcoins.  Good for them but I wanna buy too.
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:01:39
This is not true for Bitcoin.  People regularly give away thousands of bits and some tens of thousands.  Bits will reach parity with the dollar in 2-3 years so people right now are literally being tipped thousands of dollars by single one person tippers.

Just like with stocks, follow the smart money.

Are you all this gullible?  Some broad shows up and you're ready to do anything, not even considering that maybe you're the mark, you're the ones being made out as tools.
For all we know some guy had his laptop stolen with bitcoins or maybe even killed or kidnapped and this could be some methhead dunce trying to steal the guy's bitcoins but can't get professional help cause they'll ask too many questions.
So he comes on reddit, and sure enough, hundreds of clowns jumping up and down cause it's a woman.
Tell me, if this were a male widow, wouldn't you have asked some questions and been a bit suspicious?
This exactly why JP Morgan and the NSA are in the midst of hi-jacking bitcoin and none of you see it. 
And why none of you see iXcoin is in-play by the same syndicate and will explode [to ~$10] imminently.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:49:28
Of course you're stealing their accounts.  And so what?  It's all free game and BCT is being ran by a bunch of bitcoin millionaire stiffs who spend all their time cooking up ways to stifle free speech and banning people for any "off topic" comments.  They've become bloated and stupid like any monopoly.  Kinda like Gox, it's time for Bitcointalk to take a long dirt nap.
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:53:42
Dear Widow, 
there's a much easier way to find out what you're dealing with, as far as Bitcoins, so you can then make an easier decision what to do next.
These guys offering advice are newbies so forgive them.  I'm a PhD in forensic computer science and part of my specialty is getting hard to get info off people's computers.
Therefore, you can trust me, I'm a Dr.
So go on your husband's main computer, the one he used the most often, and from that computer simply click on the link I'll provide you at the bottom of this post.  It's a simple script program to help you locate the information you're looking for so you don't accidentally delete it while looking for it.
Remember, once you delete bitcoins, they're gone forever.
So just click this link and good luck to you:
 
xoxo, 
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:26:32
I said long ago Russia and China were secretly hoarding Bitcoin and all the banning bullshit were games to allow them to hoard more.
The US and the West will need a Bitcoin twin if I'm right otherwise they would be transferring wealth to the east.
Find that other [twin] coin and you'll make hundreds of millions of dollars.
PS:  to those who say this wouldn't work cause BTC is too cheap, you don't get what cryptos are about.  Ifs a wealth transfer scheme.  The rich are getting in now before the media starts pumping it and a massive global wealth transfer takes place when the 99% finally decide to jump in.
We're not even at 1% yet and the banks and govts are already hoarding BTC and select alt-coins.  
Massive voluntary theft coming.

All you guys who think PoS secures a coin's network, you should talk to Oleg.
As for this prediction, anything is possible although I think the high bids will be in the $800 range.
Whatever the high bids are, that's where the price is going tomorrow so last chance to buy now.

Andreas is the same puppet who just 10 days ago said there was no way for the state to ever control bitcoin.
I contradicted him and he blocked me from twitter.  lol.
Now he's telling everyone to pay their taxes after pumping Bitcoin as uncontrolable by the state, decentralized and anonymous.
As I've said from day one:  Bitcoin et al were designed to empower the banks, corporations and especially governments.  
Bitcoin is a massive global asset tracking tool and as such it will be fully controlled by the banks and governments.
Andreas today has proved that he's either a liar or he has no idea what's going on or how the world functions. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:02:25
China and Russia are secretly amassing bitcoin.
Why wouldn't communist governments want a digital coin which is designed to totally track and control their citizens, and to have instant access to all their incomes and wealth, including the instant ability to freeze or confiscate anyone's income or wealth?
Maybe you still don't understand what Bitcoin and Cryptos were designed to do.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:31:34
That's because the owners of Coinbase [ie. Horowitz, Andresseen, etc.,] and all their banker buddies are buying up the bulk of the available Bitcoins. That's the primary reason they funded Coinbase - instant access to bitcoin.
Very much a conflict of interest but the sheep have no clue.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:09:24
Buy into it, eh?  Like the 5% they got from Silk Road and the 1 million coins from Satoshi's wallet? Oh, and who got the 7% from Gox.
Is 20% of bitcoin enough for you?
And when the govt bans all cryptos (for national security) with one executive order, tell me, what new crypto will you switch to and where will you spend it.
Cause that means you print dollars at home right now, since I'm sure you don't agree with the current dollar policies.
Like I said:  children.

Bitcoins are never lost since they never leave the Blockchain, just your wallet or private key is lost.  
Since the NSA created SHA256d, I'm sure they have a Backdoor into the Blockchain to grab all these "forever lost" Bitcoin when the opportune time comes.
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:57:44
Dude, you just took those words right off my riddle thread on bitcointalk.
I've been saying for over a year greed and fear will take Bitcoin to $10,000 [next year] and much much higher.
And it all starts with the Bitcoin ETF which should be licensed soon.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:29:14
That's funny, you created that image?  Lol, you stole the image taken by someone else and adjusted the colors and you call that "created".
Yet this guy came up with a cool idea to use that as a wallet and you're treating him like a thief.  
There was no original idea in your theft while his idea for a wallet was original and he can use that image just like you did as you cannot trademark colors which is the only think you added/changed to that image.
Bravo to the guy who thought of using this as a paper wallet. Original and you deserve donations.  And you can use that image until its creator, the AP photographer, says differently.
And don't worry about this guy who thinks he created colors.  lol.
@_date: 2014-04-27 09:03:11
Boy, so much for anonymous given the whole world can track any purchase you make.  And soon you'll have to add your ID to your wallet.

The problem is that it seems BU will get most of the hashpower so Core will become the short chain or the alt and will most likely change the algo and add PoS to avoid constant 51 attacks.  Things are about to get really crazy.  
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:14:06
The fact remains:  If the government can force the masses to pay taxes on Bitcoin then it will be just as easy to force everyone to attach their ID and social security numbers to their wallets.
People really don't see this is coming next?
Andreas is clueless to not see this as he's an insider.  So how is bitcoin decentralized and uncontrolled by the state if the state is making all the [burdensome] rules for Bitcoin and the masses blindly obey, following puppets like Andreas.
Mark my words, if Bitcoin is property it is marked as such simply to next force everyone to add a title and ID to their wallets.  Watch what Andreas says then, further sugar coating everything.
CoinValidation is already set up for this and you mean to tell me Andreas is not aware?  Like I said, he's either lying or he has no idea how the world functions which makes him just another puppet for the banks, govt and the media.

That's cause everybody is stupid and Dr. Wright is a genius.  Every muppet and monkey just needs to accept it cause he is the real OG Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:15:47
You Satoshi worshippers, you really can't see that Dr. Wright is the real Satoshi and all you maggots have crucified him?  Wright is the guy.  He's LEGIT you muppets!!!!
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:05:11
No.  
Bitcoin is going to explode in price soon so miners are gearing up to stay ahead of the curve.

I saw Luke Jr mention a few weeks ago that they were coming this summer.  Not sure when exactly.  They were delayed due to the whole scaling fiasco.  Paul Sztorc also mentioned something in the same thread about working on them.  
If somebody knows their redding ID's page them, maybe we'll get a more exact date.  I'm hoping June-July since Bitcoin is gonna have serious issues otherwise when it halves.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:44:05

Stop and think about the cost of logistics alone. 
There's tons of gold in places like Siberia but it's too costly to dig out, but hey, we're gonna go into outer space with r2d2 space shovels and get gold and bring it back to earth and make a profit at $1200 per ounce when it's nearly a grand to mine down the street.

You'll go to prison reciting that 2011 horseshit.  There is already judicial precedent that Bitcoin is money.  And a commodity as well so that way they can also tax you on any appreciation.

@_date: 2015-08-25 17:45:53
It's actually 60% of the hash power.  All the Chinese pools are united against XT and Gavin knows it so it makes you wonder why he's still pushing ahead.
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:38:48
When will you guys get it that ALL the Chinese pools are united and will vote together.
Welcome to China!

@_date: 2015-08-19 22:38:22
Peter Todd is one of the top 3 core devs.
This is getting serious and the Chinese haven't even started raining down fire on XTcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:53:59
You really think Gavin et al would blatantly ignore Szabo?
I think Szabo is playing games to try and appear neutral and to appear against the coming massive centralization so he can continue having a voice once everyone realizes Bitcoin is BankCoin.
If Szabo was really against XT he would have a serious impact and he would do more than a few tweets.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:28:54
What a shocker!
I've said since last month the Chinese were gonna kill XT.
Wait for the fireworks show next month.  Haha.

You can transfer BTC to wireX from any source.

10 years?  Lol.  Try next year.
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:15:48
They can and eventually will.  They first have to regulate it, centralize it and control it.  Including each wallet being identified to a specific person (probably for life).  Then just deduct at will.
Don't bitch about it, you'll be rich or dead by then off Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:19:57
Silly bitcoiners, did you actually believe Andreas?  Read Vlad2Vlad's riddle thread, the truth has been out for 3 years.  
@_date: 2016-02-18 21:48:14
I lost my ass and now I got no ass to give.
And this, this has been the bane of my existence.  
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:50:55
Great, now they wanna screw up the blockchain.

You're as legit as they come, Paul!
@_date: 2016-09-10 14:26:42
Oh such bullshit.  This is so Andreas a la 2013.  Spin a new FUD record.
@_date: 2016-09-07 10:21:43
I can't believe they mention sidechains.  That's promising.
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:57:34
What do you mean?
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:18:57
It's back up.

Can Andreas tell us if these will be anonymous and decentralized?   ;D
@_date: 2016-09-25 11:56:37
Ver's money isn't running out, it's growing.  When you have 300,000 btc and you're in early on schemes like ETH &amp; ETC, you make more than you can imagine.

@_date: 2016-09-11 21:24:18
Good for you.  Go for the jugular on this one!
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:48:08
Without reading the article I'm gonna guess:
-  Negative rates
-  To get rid of tax evasion 
-  To get rid of illegal activities:  laundering, drugs, etc... 
-  Total control over the gen pop.  (I doubt this one is in there)
-  I'll add a 5th:  Cause banks, corps and govts will see mass cost savings and the former 2 will see many other benefits like instant direct target marketing.
@_date: 2016-09-08 18:47:39
Bahahaaaaa.  Talk about manipulation.  I can add up a few million BTC just in the top 10 known holders which prooves this is a lie.
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:58:33
That's just the prelude to what's coming.

Boy, if only “experts” like Andreas could have predicted this years ago.  :/
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:54:53
What an idiot this guy is.  Shitcoin's intrinsic value is exactly equal to Bitcoin's intrinsic value which is ZERO!
@_date: 2015-04-11 19:51:22
That was foolish.  after the ETF, within the next year, that 14 BTC will buy you a new Lambo!
But congrats for keeping the Eco system alive.
Much appreciated.
@_date: 2015-09-26 06:30:58
Andreas will prove to be the king of Bitcoin shills in the next few years.
Mark my words.

That’s a guarantee.  Been saying it for 6 years.  You guys new here?

How many Bitcoins is that?
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:41:20
They can censor you by simply shadow banning you.  I was shadow banned for over a year.  Just a couple weeks ago was I released.  Not sure why, maybe it was an automated thing or maybe Theymos is finally letting me out of my cage.  lol

Sighs of imminent geopolitical and economic collapse.  Bitcoin/crypto is the lifeboat since that's where the global wealth transfer is going.  People's fear and ignorance is what has kept them from investing.  They will pay a steep certainty tax.  
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:14:35
You think these people care about being accused or being charged with fraud?  With all the money and power behind Bitcoin, if they could have been stopped it would have happened already.  Whoever they are, they are beyond the reach of western laws.  
@_date: 2016-10-02 09:03:21

Just like I predicted in 2013, Bitcoin has been hijacked by bankers, venture capitalists and the govt.

What?  
Edit:  Wouldn't the collective people notice getting robbed on a regular basis and abandon that alt?  No different than banks being able to take your money from your account.  They can't but they don't cause you know, you'd quickly find out about it.

A sky rocketing price will fix the issue of insufficient reward after block halvening.  There, problem fixed, it's gonna be sidechains regardless of what Gavin or the bankers want.

Cause the banks and govts run all money schemes.
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:32:22
The govt is not trying to prevent the reset, they have been engineering the great global reset for decades.  But it's difficult to time such a massive global event with so many unpredictable parts.  They'll keep printing until there's no more value to print.  And that should be very very soon.
@_date: 2016-10-14 06:53:00
Seriously?  How many are the hottest thing since the internet with a finite amount of 21 million and a "safe haven" for economic meltdown and quite possibly the replacement for fiat?  $100,000 is conservative.

They only dream of digital money which will greatly cut the cost of cash distribution and circulation. Not to mention negative rates and tracking everyone.  Who still believes this utter Andreas bullshit?
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:29:58
They concluded that he did nothing wrong.  It was merely a tax audit on one of his businesses.  He paid the full tax bill plus penalties which came out to around $40k.  That's all it was - the media just wanted to make him look bad.

@_date: 2016-05-31 09:10:48
That's just it.  They're filing BK so they can keep the BTC and pay back little to nothing to investors.  If you believed Bitcoin was going to $10,000 and higher wouldn't you be using different metrics when deciding your cashflows and breakeven point?  The Chinese aren't fools, they're not mining at a loss for no reason!

Dipshits, when they look up your ass with a microscope and you're running multi million dollar businesses owing $40k in taxes and fees is nothing.  And it was just one business, they audited them all.  I posted the govt findings on my riddle thread.  Don't be lazy, do some homework.  
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:32:35
Dang, BitJohn, that's a sweet option.  But seriously fix my negative 60 million BLU error, 8 months is a long time for an open ticket.  Thx and good luck with all this noise, I've always been a loyal cryptsy customer cause you guys went the longest without getting hacked.

@_date: 2016-05-04 19:39:40
Actually that plan went as planned.  2 govt agents working on the inside at Gox?  What are the odds of that?  I predicted at the beginning it was a govt theft of the Gox coins.  
Long before it came to light.  So this plan will work out - I just wish I could figure out the exact plan.  I have ideas but there are multiple possibilities.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:36:19
He didn't back out, did he?  It just won't be on-chain.  Seems like Matonis is still backing Wright.  This is getting more confusing.
@_date: 2016-05-05 10:51:30
I would go to New York just got the lulz with this guy.
@_date: 2016-05-31 07:05:52
Nah, if they were thinking long term they would be mining Bitcoin at a heavy loss right now.  If I had mining gear I would gladly mine at a loss, let alone massive mining farms.  Follow the money.

Very few people think Wright is Satoshi and it's not because there is no proof he isn't.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:10:44
Dr. Wright is Satoshi and not only have his worshippers ignored him but they also mocked and ridiculed him.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:34:07
Oh, so you're one of those guys who prints fake dollars in freely available laser printers.  What's easier to track, a fake $100 piece of paper or digital money?   
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:19:23
Yeah nearly.  As in almost.  Cause you know they only applied for COIN about 2.5 years ago which is NEARLY 3 years.  GBTC has too many restrictions, can't be used as arbitrage and isn't liquid.
Coin is a different animal and it will rock Bitcoin and crypto into another world.
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:35:05
Buy now.  Bitcoin is gonna skyrocket later this year.  $670 is still cheap.  Don't be a pussy, man up!!!
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:01:48
Didn't Dr. Wright give an explanation of how he came up with the name Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:04:18
No shit.  Maybe now you clowns are beginning to understand.  More is coming.  MUCHO MOAR!
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:56:14
100% of all exchanges are gonna go full verification.  Did you guys really believe the bs anonymity fairy tales Andreas/Ver were peddling? 
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:22:12
I've been saying this was a guarantee for nearly 3 years.

I read a couple months ago that Expedia no longer accepted BTC but I never checked.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:43:39
Let's see what they pushed most of all.
-  Bashing Core
-  Scaling propaganda 
-  Pumping Ether while making it look like Bitcoin was gonna die.
Unless Ver has other goals I'd say is done.
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:26:22
I've been saying from the beginning Wright is the real Satoshi and everyone is destroying him.  Actually so funny to watch his biggest worshippers crucifying him.  
Glad Satoshi got to see what kind of shitheads he's dealing with, who truly sees and believes and who were nothing more than self serving sycophants.
@_date: 2016-07-15 08:39:50
Nothing, the SEC doesn't care about risking other people's money or facts, it has its own agenda and Bitcoin going mainstream has already been long decided.  
This ETF application is just circle jerk material for the monkeys and for plausible deniability so their hands are clean.
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:32:42
It's about time.  This will change the Bitcoin price on absurd ridiculous ways.

Bahahahaaaaa.  This guy and his cat.  What a riot.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:18:27
I use 2 spaces.  I don't get why that means anything.  EVERYONE who took typing class in high school learned to double space after periods.  It was required.
You guys really went to school and wrote papers with single spaces?  That was like leaving commas out in your math proofs.  A big no-no.
@_date: 2016-07-17 04:37:14

@_date: 2016-07-26 04:53:02
There was a secret service guy working inside Gox as well.  It doesn't take a genius to figure this out.
@_date: 2016-07-27 19:17:46
I will be accepting formal apologies on Bitcointalk.  
Just trust me on this.  This ether hack and circus is all about splitting Bitcoin in two.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:30:13
He is an academic and they tend to want their recognition.  And the Bitcoin community in general is not his peers, with a few exceptional individuals so again, it may be a character flaw but I find it difficulty to judge him cause I would probably stomp on everyone and smash Bitcoin into a thousand pieces if it were mine and they treated me with such contempt.  
I think people have followed the headlines instead of following their hearts on this matter.
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:58:45
Oh, if it were that simple.
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:44:59

Great post, man!!!
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:19:10
Are we still talking about Dr. Wright, cause that sounds like Vlad2Vlad.  
That said, sometimes genius are just plain arrogant fools.  And if Wright is Satoshi, well, can you blame him?
@_date: 2016-07-28 08:29:11
Cause I'm the riddler, being cryptic is how I do.  Just hold on to your kibbles &amp; bits.

Sorry, you'll need to wait for sidechains to get what you were promised by Ver &amp; Andreas.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:28:44
No like if you don't wanna pay the bank fees or to avoid bail-ins.  There is no option to take your coins out and put them under your mattress or simply out of the blockchain.  That's a massive benefit to banks and govts.

What's the big deal about August 1st?
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:56:38
It wasn't to hurt Bitcoin but rather to accumulate it from the masses.
@_date: 2016-07-21 10:25:47
Hahaha.  Good one!
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:34:29
We'll soon see about that.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:48:56
Seriously?  So banks can't hike fees once you switch to full digital?  What are you gonna do, take your bitcoins out of the blockchain?  There's a reason coins can never leave.   
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:09:17
You're right but the game isn't being played on the rich.  Look closer...much closer.  
Dr. Wright is Satoshi...

That's hilarious!!!  I would gladly pay for one of these!!!

This WireX app is awesome.  I can't wait to use it.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:59:34
Bitcoin blows up and dies.  But that's 120 years from now so it's cool.
@_date: 2016-07-17 18:17:39
This is another govt lie.  Bitcoin stops piracy dead in its tracks just like it does with corruption and black markets.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:48:37
Crypto is gonna go the way the govt wants it cause it's much easier to track and control than paper fiat.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:48:44

That's herd mentality and that's why there is hype and manipulation - cause common sense doesn't work while fear and greed are excellent tools.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:46:55
COIN will allow tens of trillions of dollars in mutual funds and pension funds to legally buy BTC.  Since BTC is now legally a new asset and a technology play, it's hard To imagine what fund manager won't put at least a few % in Bitcoin.  Trillions are about to be pushed into Bitcoin over the next couple years.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:53:03
Downvoted.  But I Don't know why cause I can't keep track of where we are in this circle jerk.  lol
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:47:09
The major miners have 82% of the network now.  They'll have over 90% soon.  So regular guys can plug in whatever they want, at any given price the big miners will take most of the bitcoins plus fees.  
Best thing to do is buy BTC and hold.  
@_date: 2016-07-19 20:50:10
At $10,000+ they'll make plenty of money.  At $100,000 they'll make a killing off fees alone.  ;)
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:25:01

yeah cause war is just gonna end when we use digital money.  Hahaha, you guys really believe the tall tales told by Andreas and Ver?  lol
@_date: 2016-07-22 15:13:08
It helps drive Bitcoin volume and txs.  I'm gonna sit on my BTC if I don't have an easy way to spend and store them.  I got this WireX app and ordered 3 cards.  I've never used BTC for anything but now I will.  And I will also HODL what % I'm not sulking to sell.
All these major players want Bitcoin to succeed and driving adoption through ease of use is key.  Once phones have hardware wallets or some really secure mobile wallet comes along then these Bitcoin to Visa cards won't be needed. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:29:09
That's absurd. Less friction = savings not losses.  
@_date: 2016-07-15 08:35:14
The guy has some valid points but it won't matter.  The SEC will simply add the warnings to an updated application and grant the license.  That way their hands are clean regardless of what happens.  Actually I'm sure they prefer it this way.  I know I would.
@_date: 2016-07-27 21:36:18
Seriously?  You smuggle kittens for crying outloud.  I'm at least 1 notch above your moral ground.  
Trust me!
@_date: 2016-07-10 06:41:12
That's way too confusing for most people.  They'll probably go to straight bits - 1 million bits in 1 Bitcoin.  Much easier.  
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:44:33
No not true.  Arbitrage will come into play.  COIN will settle everyday at 4pm I believe.  So there will be some deviation but nothing like GBTC.
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:20:51
oh I see what you meant by NEARLY.
Gee golly, there are other forums other than crappy reddit.  I'm never serious on here, I mostly troll the trolls.  You should check out Bitcointalk and this other thing called Twitter.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:20:29
I've been saying this for 3 years.  Bitcoin will empower banks.  
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:47:44
They'll take it closed source; one way transparency.  Impossible for any government to allow everyone to watch their txs.

Shithead?  300,000 BTC says he can be a shithead.  lol
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:43:36
No, because with COIN you'll be able to arbitrage.  With GBTC isn't possible.  Plus GBTC is very illiquid due to the fact the coins have to be held for a year.  COIN will change the game in a massive way.  Floodgates to trillions of dollars from pension funds.
@_date: 2016-07-04 13:54:19
CEX has been around a long time and they seem to have big backers.  I'd say they're one of the more legit exchanges.
@_date: 2016-07-29 19:34:44
Hahaha.  You mean like Bitcoin is gonna end war and the blockchain is like Starbucks?  Hahaha.
When you have 300,000 Bitcoins I guess you can say stupid shit all day and they'll just keep begging for more.
@_date: 2016-07-15 08:45:00
The technology is free.  Copy and paste.  Bitcoin is just one of many underlying tokens which can be easily replaced [before it reaches critical mass].  
But nobody is getting rid of Bitcoin yet.   It's going mainstream everywhere, even in China.  Probably starting later this summer.
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:58:30
How much?
@_date: 2016-07-10 06:42:04
That was never settled.  Nobody is gonna use a metric system, it's gonna be straight bits.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:23:11
Downvoted For upvoting the Pokemon.
@_date: 2016-07-10 06:21:25
COIN is intended to bring trillions into Bitcoin/Cryptob from mutual funds and pensions funds.  Those accounts cannot buy Bitcoin yet.  A few can use GBTC but that's not even 1% right now and GBTC trades at a massive premium.  
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:02:50
It feels like a lot more than that to me.  And I prefer to stay away from razors, I'm unstable like that.  lol
@_date: 2016-07-28 22:01:44
Actually if ETC hits $1 billion the day I predicted when it was at $.59 I'd say the Ethereum fork will be the main reason they Hardfork BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:22:45
Bitcoin is already centralized.
As for regulated - how do you dream of a way to go mainstream without the cooperation of banks, corporations and especially, governments? 
You people don't see reality.

@_date: 2016-07-15 13:47:50
What?  Fund managers decide where most of that money goes.  And the U.S. Has already passed laws to take over full control of the "choice" people have.
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:00:13
Every central bank and govt has issued warnings.  It's called plausible deniability.

No shit!!!
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:50:47
COIN is gonna open up the floodgates to tens of trillions of pension and mutual fund money.  What money manager is not gonna buy at least 1% of a new asset class and new technology if nothing more than just as a hedge.  There's gonna be a mad rush into Bitcoin by these fund managers.

They have already decided to give Bitcoin the ETF license.  They don't ask for numerous application updates unless they're gonna give it to you.  That and other reasons.
COIN is only a matter of time.  Should happen very soon.  Maybe later this summer - early fall.
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:24:25
Sidechains will come sooner and will suffice.
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:24:30
You're right but the U.S. is enough to change from metric to bits.  Besides its not intuitive to say you spent fractions of something.  It's much more simple to use simple bits.  There's no doubt we're gonna use bits.
