Nope. Just go to sleep
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:49:09
Be happy that Bitcoin will never be a currency like British pound
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:34:48
We all can to just sell everything
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:13:30
Not a currency like British pound. Please read...
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:00:54
The normal people dont buy Bitcoin. I know a lot of Turkish people as the live in Holland where I also live. Their family in Turkey buying Euro. It makes no sence to buy Bitcoin, because it dropped even harder than Lira.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:13:15
What if....
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:44:55
And it keeps dropping. Amazing.. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:11:06
Why is everybody looking to the past? I dont think it is that easy. Maybe people need that to have the courage to hodl
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:01:23
I think you dont really know what you are talking about... Please visit Turkey and talk to the locals. Dont just watch the news and judge on what you see on television.
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:00:07
No Bitcoin is dropping again, so no Turkish reaction. Bitcoin is not for poor countries. It never will be
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:24:17
You are so damn wright
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:49:34
Useless it is...
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:59:21
Mt Gox sold 8200 BTC. That is causing more selling by other people.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:46:18
All over the news
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:05:22
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:27:04
No that is really not what I mean. In Turkey the people don't own anything. They live in houses from a bank, drive the car from the bank and even where clothes from money of the bank. They also have the highest prices for fuel in the world. They have to work every single our to pay the bank. The whole economy is manupulated for years. In an economy like that, it is too risky to put the little bit of money they do own on Bitcoin. 
I am not an American. Just a Dutchman who knows a lot of Turkeys people, because we have 1 milion living here in Holland. And I visit Turkey a lot. So please don't see the current situation in Turkey as an opportunity for Bitcoib
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:43:42
Because of another Mt Gox dump of 8000 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:36:34
Only 10%??
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:54:40
It is really not a drop in a river. Many more people are selling because of this. You think it is just about 8200 BTC. Just look what comes after that single drop...
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:42:49
No. I just saw the price dropping, smart ass...
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:03:26
I think so. This market is very nervous. We saw the reaction of people about the Mt Gox dumping recently. This is not caused just by dumping 8000 bitcoin. It is just a stimulation for other people to sell. And they do as you can see. Everything has a reason..
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:57:29
No. They are buying Euro's as they live next to Europa. And a lot of Dollars to be safe.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:07:21
No. We are dropping like crazy right now
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:57:24
Mt Gox is scaring people. So they sell...
Mt Gox sold 8200 which causes more sellings after
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:14:27
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:28:00
No. Just making money, honey
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:39:09
Hope so
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:44:38
Nice thing to always remember Bitcoin after the final crash
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:16:49
Looks like this party ends this week
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:13:58
I think this is very realistic. It keeps dropping since december. But after all that pain it will grow again. Bitcoin is a big hype all over the world now...
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:25:43
You never know. I will be very satisfied when it hits 10K.  
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:18:21
But it will drop further. A lot of fear and awareness will cause selling.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:23:40
Game over
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:13:08
No. Not very realistic. It keeps dropping
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:59:26
Because there is no trust in crypto anymore, it won't be pumped again that easily. This whole market is pump and dump market. The coins itselfs will not be used under massive adoption. We already have fiat. The only use for people is to make extra fiat out of crypto. Without the trust it will not rise soon. Face it...
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:37:02
I had a very nice bonus in salary last month. So I really dint care if it drops. Within 2 years it will be bullish again. So I just wait and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:19:55
I will and I dont care. Within 2 years it will be bullish again. For now I can lose 5000 Euro, but I can also win 50000. Looks an interesting and fair deal to me. I invested just some money. It wont be a disaster to just lose it..
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:12:04
Stupid fool. That's what you are...
@_date: 2018-06-20 06:21:07
Another hack... That is why people love Fiat and banks. People wants to be secure and need the feeling to have their money safe. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:26:31
After that I will spend 1K in the casino ;)
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:19:32
No problem. As long as it will hit 10K in the future...
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:13:58
No ofcourse not. Just a lower value
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:11:55
It will drop further and further
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:21:46
Thanks. I am very confident that I will make some serious money on the longer term
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:11:15
No way. Bought enough dips already
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:20:05
Not very realistic
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:05:30
Very unlikely, but you never know.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:25:42
Based on what??
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:19:52
Nonsens. Just looking at the past. This is a very different situation. It will drop a lot more before we will reach the bottom. Sorry mate...
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:45:13
Maybe, maybe not..
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:03:47
Ofcourse not.  It is the same as losing your money in a casino
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:58:09
Please keep in mind that it is still dropping for a very long time. That is the perpective you also have to think of....
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:36:29
Little??? This is huge, but it can recover. It is important to stay calm. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:56:19
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:39:21
Dead?? Is a currency dead with a price like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:43:36
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:07:02
Everytime when Bitcoin goes up, new fud is coming. Very strange. Looks like people earning money for spreading fud...
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:04:22
Dream on
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:33:23
You really think that it will be always the same? I think that would be too easy
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:25:54
Don't think about profit when you bought in December. Just Hodl and see you losses getting smaller in a few months. Stay calm
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:10:24
US Dollar collapsing? Dream on...
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:29:14
Why should history repeat itself?? I dont get it...
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:20:22
It could be. Bitcoin is bearish for already 3 months now. But you never know what future brings
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:17:19
Wait for positive news. It will drop further
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:14:32
Just wait. It is still dropping and without positive news it will be dropping for longer term
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:42:31
Everytime the same story... this is the time to buy. I dont think so
