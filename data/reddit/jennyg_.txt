Yeah but no other network is so secure, protected by so much decentralized hash power and is universally accepted. I do not really see what your argument is...
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:03:18
hm somehow that makes sense
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:10:25

It shows that BTC is about so much more than just making money trading or some stuff. We are part of a revolution

The world gold council tries to protect its own existence. Anybody surprised?

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash do not protect privacy. They hate it because it takes control away from them.
If you want to protect your privacy you should use Monero or ZCash.

I guess: either you will have at least 10x or you sold your house for free. We will see. Good luck!!

Because it is simple af...
i don't use it anymore though

yes, it is as safe as a crypto exchange can be. GDAX belongs to Coinbase.
So it is part of a well-funded copmany with US security standards.
If you have a lot of money on it however, consider controling your own private key

Bitcoin cash will be gone as soon as lightning comes out. I guess even Roger is selling this worthless stuff
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:14:00
Yeah all weak hands: go home
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:24:25
Wow that is actually quite positive

I strongly disagree. This crypto hype will make millenials like me more aware of what else is out there. I began to love investing &lt;3

If you are a US citizen there is no place where you can buy BTCs without KYC legally that is secure. You might easily be scammed.
You could mine Bitcoins or buy them at a meetup. Ofc you have to pay a markup
