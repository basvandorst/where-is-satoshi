I don’t know about that. After the price hit 10k I started talking to my family and friends about it and I still get eye rolls. If you are looking for a secret little club, don’t worry it’s still there. And it’s still at 17k at the time I’m writing this.
If you don’t want your coins feel free to donate them to me.

After we have mined all the coins there are to mine, then we can start describing in mBTC. By that time smaller portions of a coin will be more valuable so it will be necessary. Like breaking a dollar (a satoshi) into quarters and dimes (mBTC). For now Satoshi are cool I think.

Bought and started light mining with shit GPU’s with a close friend in a basement in 2016, when it was barely breaking $600.  Held until early April this year when I wanted to move back home because my mom got seriously ill. I had no leads on meaningful work and I had bills piling up. I sold my minuscule coin for   ~1200 bucks to pay rent and eat more than 1 meal a day. I eventually got a solid job.
Come October of this year I hear we are back up to like 10k.  I shit my pants and dump half a paycheck and cop some more. My friends and gf call me reckless considering the situation I just got out of/ am still dealing with. (Fuck Cancer)
But they don’t know that the coins have bailed me out at my lowest, and I plan to fucking hodl until I can get a Tesla Roadster and act like I don’t know nobody.

They are loud as hell and hot. I’ve seen them in action and honestly I’d rather just trade to make some extra coin. Saves you some stress and you don’t have to calculate extra electricity useage, which can also flag you for growing pot if you are in a weird area. Try to take advantage of arbitrage and alt coin prices. Also look into Genesis Mining. Some Canadians will mine for you if you pay for electricity/service fee or something like that.

Hold it and watch it grow. 
Don’t store you coins on an exchange for any extended period of time. Buy a hard wallet and put them in there. 
Never lose the pass phrase for your hard wallet. When you learn more about how the exchanges work, try your hand at trading. It’s a simple buy low, sell high system. 
The complicated part is trying to predict bull markets and looking for good exchange rates for alt coins. 
Happy hunting, I started out investing just $50.

OP saw “The Big Short” once, now an expert.
jk, I hope you are right. Let’s see what happens!

You are right, there is a finite amount of coin that will ever be mined. We are projected to hit that cap in 2025-ish. Like a previous user said, each fraction of a coin (satoshis and fractions of them) will then increase in value. Value for the coin will increase or decrease based on the trade of coins, and the value of other currencies (FIAT and crypto) around it.
At least that’s what I think.

50/50 in BTC and Ethereum. Also buy a hard wallet. Put your coinage in there then forget they exists until after the market stabilizes in a few months. See what you’ve got then.

Invest in a mining pool or just invest and hodl. Otherwise it’s not profitable unless you have 8+ high end GPUs daisy chained together, or have the room, noise tolerance, and money for an Antminer S9. 
However, You can build a rig to mine alts like Ethereum for like ~$3000 with a little research and technical know how. There’s this Eastern European dude on YouTube making awesome builds for mining various coins. Do some research and look at a calculator to see if the gear you wanna buy will have good returns in your area.
I would link vids but I am at work and don’t want to browse YouTube.

It’s all about the state of the countries where these transactions are being processed or the coins are being mined. If our infrastructure adapts more sustainable energy solutions then crypto will have less of an impact on power consumption. If we are mostly using solar and wind instead of nuclear and fossil fuels then this whole thing wouldn’t be a problem. It’s not the users faults, to be honest it’s our country. I’m a bitter American.

This sucks, I’m sorry for your problems. I would recommended contacting your bank about the pending transaction, and trying to reverse the sale of you don’t hear from Kraken ASAP. They will more than likely get back to you very soon, I just know that the market has been flooded with transactions lately because of the dip (or causing the dip, who knows). 
In the future, I would recommended investing portions of your total over the course of a few weeks, like 25k at a time so you can prepare for market fluctuations.
Good luck. And HODL.
