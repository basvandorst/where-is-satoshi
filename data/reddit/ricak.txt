You know, some people really miss the old Nigerian Prince that wanted to give money away....  
they may find him via these ads.

got it, thanks!
so it means that in terms of energy consumption things would remain the same until a new development is done or a new technology is developed?
Wouldn't Lightning Network help with this?

That answer doesn't help a bit.
FUD or not I think it is something people should know and be educated on... that is why I'm asking about it.

Thank you for the answers

welcome to the real world... people care of about wrong things.
Listen, i'm not arguing with you or trying to make a point.
I just know that i'm not a (very) technical person, but this topic comes out very often when discussing bitcoin with other colleagues, that are not technical at all. If they want to argue against Bitcoin, that is one of the points they use. That is why I thought of asking about this point. So I have a better understanding of it.

if a topic is called more often than others, then it might be important to be able to clarify that.
Imagine a world where browsers just started to exist. And people just tell you that sending letters is much better.... maybe you might want to explain some technicalities and let them know how better it is.

You are missing the point.
 I can buy X$ now and never touch it again...
But I can also by X$ each week, or month, or 3 months.... and over time it keeps growing and averaging the price.
  
That is what I'm trying to find.. again.

Did that happen to you on Gemini?
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:30:00
I understand what you are saying and I thank you for that. But i'm just trying to find this website for analysis purposes.
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:41:34
YES!!!!! Thank you!

Strange that they did come back with these questions.  Their website mentions "Send money and make purchases at approved merchants". So they known what merchant it would be, otherwise it would be a friend. And I would believe you could do whatever you wanted with your money. Either paying for a Cuban sandwich, Mexican taco, Chinese noodles or Iran kebab... Or even sending a money to your friend nicknamed Korean, Castro or whatever.
My reply to their email would be "no!"
I more excited each day work bitcoin and can't wait for the time when it will be widely used between the young generation.
