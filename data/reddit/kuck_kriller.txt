"it's a bubble"  lol yeh all money is.  the cool thing about crypto is you can't print a trillion new notes and hand it over to the 12 families running the federal reserve.  but hey the sellers and haters can go pretend you can have a mass withdrawal of cash from banks in an emergency. lol

It’s 100% psychological.  You spreading this retarded bullshit will ironically make others sell lol �� 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:58:44
Any growth in anything in the realm of stock, currency or non palpable value is literally is a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:58:50
Lol your post history is like reading Paul Krugman every day since election night:  AHHHHHH THE STOCK MARKET HAS CRASHED AND WILL NEVER RECOVER UNDER TRUMP!!!!!!111111

i don't own anything but it's value is that the information can't be destroyed or censored.  you quantify that.
bitcoin is an implementation of that to represent an amount of value you own that also can't be lied about or manipulated.
but it sounds like you've made up your mind so it'll be up to the next generation to adopt.  not you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:10:02
There's literally as much evidence and rationale to support it will shoot back up as yours that say it will drop down.  100% agreed it is totally random.  But there is one variable that you can use to predict with a great degree of accuracy:  WHAT PERCENT of the population has adopted it as a currency or method of holding value.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:57:25
Long time holders yes this is still an awesome market.  Short termers?  They are gone dude.  Lol
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:52:00
No wonder it collapsed so fast.  Lol look at this 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:45:46
Ok, Soviet Union, Greece, Venezuela, 1920's USA, should I go on?  OH THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN ARE YOU CRAZY DUDE
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:42:40
Yeh buddy, when a 200 year famine comes be sure to ask for you bucket of gold for your dollar notes and your nice pale of oil from venezuela.  LOL maybe if we print another quadrillion it'll ease the pain lol

I'm seeing arguments LN makes every coin viable for the top spot.  What's the deal with that?  True?  False?  Hoax?
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:24:39
lol panic?  we are WAY past that stage dude.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:26:56
Same just got 4K usd worth.  Also got 12k of gbtc on Friday.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:04:53
100%.  But why do people want somebody printing quadrillion’s of paper notes pretending it represents value when you can have a fixed system that is totally immutable to represent the value of our resources and services?  I mean is that hard to grasp?  There’s literally nothing superior to contain value.  Let the prices fluctuate until enough of a user base is formed.  But buddy once it does and there’s an even 1% adoption of it as a usable store of value... buckle the fuck up.  You think a 250b market cap at 20k value bitcoin is big.  Get ready for 5-10 trillion market cap in 5 years of users and watch the value completely break away from these corrupted money supplies that have NEVER HAD A SINGLE AUDIT IN THEIR ENTIRE HISTORY.  (Bitcoin is audited literally every second millions of times to put a giant contrast to the shit currencies)
You SHOULD think of it as a long term investment because it’s going to not just have a dollar represented value but it will totally transcend the existing money system in on psychological level as well where trust will be 100%.  Then the stage where militaries and government learn to tax us correctly and they protect it with force... that’s the end game.  But even if they don’t it is better than gold or oil as a store of value.  End of blog ha

Total crypto life.  I start businesses and startups for a living.  I vow to support crypto purchase options for every product I build and sell for the rest of my life.  And I will give discounts for transacting with crypto as well.  FUCK FIAT RUN BY CENTURY OLD FAMILIES LIKE THE FEDERAL RESERVE.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:44:53
I officially cede all moral superiority to you because you bend the knee to the people that print your money.  Oh wise man, please go on so we may learn and advance.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:09:04
Every year inflation rises x% and food prices increase x% with fiat.
Every year the complete opposite is happening for crypto holders.
We only need to cash out because businesses are still adopting it as payment types.
But hey you keep pretending we’re just using tulips buddy lol.  My brand new Tesla which I had to cash out for because I held since 2016 thanks you for showing your ignorance.  And I keep donating 3% of my salary every other week.  Have fun when another trillion USD is printed by next year 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:50:41
why would he.  he's up 1000 dollars.  thats 10x more than what people who invested in bonds or the stock market would be up in the last 2 months.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:36:43
Yay all you sellers can keep putting your value into banks and governments that can shut you down and confiscate your value whenever the fuck they want.  Enjoy!
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:04:53
I'm up huge dude.  lol
And don't worry I already withdrew and covered my initial buy in.  It's house money now and I'm still up massive.  Bubble yourself with more analogies and insults until you can't anymore.  Have fun dude.  I'll send you some bitcoin to cheer you up when you ask and say pretty please.  PM me your wallet address.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:57:41

@_date: 2018-02-05 01:47:25
Honestly?  15-20k by April if you just look at a simple log graph of bitcoin since it's first day.  The super wide range is 5k - 25k.  Either one is equally likely.  It's honestly all the same to long time holders but I know a lot of newbies are gonna hate that since they are eating some loses right now.  Just be patient.  The more the world adopts the higher the price skyrockets.  And it will.  It fucking does this other every year or so.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:55:43
When tesla accepts bitcoin in 2 years as payment I will gladly transact.  Until then I’ll get to soak up your love of Rothschild banks who can keep you happy short term.
Please go on so in 5 years time I can laugh even harder.  This is going to be 100x funnier than every liberal crying and lighting up my phone on election night being little imbecile bitches lololol.
How was that night for you lol.  Please reply how it was lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:42:06
Just say it’s a system where information can live forever with no ability for Twitter Facebook Google or the government to take it down.
The ultimate free speech database.  That makes it the prime candidate to store currency values.
