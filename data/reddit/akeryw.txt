For me? Nearly nothing. I run a node on the same sever where I host my webpages, email and jabber server. It's 512mb ram, 800mhz atm. A few $ per month for all.
You can try setting a basic node on [free vps]( it won't be stable, so you won't get a guard node, but you will have one ;)

OH GOD NO, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. DO **NOT** USE bitcurex!!
It's a very shady website, they have been compromised, rumours say they bought source code from 3rd party and never made any security audit, they don't even have client support!!
Use bitmarket.pl, it's faster, haven't been compromised, they have client support.

@_date: 2014-09-25 13:33:05
It's a config for one node ;)
My another has faster internet connection, but it's less stable and Dir port is closed. Another config is my old laptop at home, more ports open, connection via PIA and it's also my torrent box, so connection speed varies.

SIM card applet programmer here: 
SIM cards have built-in processor dedicated to ONE TYPE of encryption and it's RSA. ONLY generating 2048bits RSA keys would take DAYS on standard SIM card processor. DAYS to generate KEYS, WEEKS to encrypt a message.
Your mobile phone has billions times more computational power than a SIM card.

The processor has only one thread and it's responsible for much more operations. It has very limited memory (two kinds cache and ~ROM), it's also shared between JVM, applet that communicates with user (buttons, input fields etc.). 
For encryption it has dedicated CPU, but they are also very limited, we had a customer who wanted to support +2048 RSA encryption in their applet, we lost the customer because SIM cards with so strong encryption were too expensive for them. On market you will find cards with support from 256bits to 1024, depends on country.
You can encrypt the message with that dedicated "CPU", but I wouldn't trust it, you still need mobile phone, SC reader, JavaCard applet, OS on the sim card... I wouldn't trust that technology, too many risk and weak points. And yeah, if that SIM card can talk to the network, you government can download that data and network provider can install back-door there.

@_date: 2014-09-25 17:16:08
Depends on what kind of traffic is passed, if the communication is from-to Tor server-client, than it is not possible to sniff it. If it is public-web to Tor client, then exit node can sniff nearly everything. There are lists of exit nodes that sniff on users and the list are public 
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:42:39
As a sim card applet developer, I wouldn't trust that kind of technology. IMO brain-wallets would be more secure.

I enable showing me ads on website I like, like reddit, 4chan, I bought a few reddit golds. I know how to support websites that play fair, by just showing me ads and allowing to buy reddit gold/4chanpass without tracking me and injecting JS from several domains, [just like SMH](
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:08:35


You just lost that bet. I have own-hosted email server, file sync server.
I avoid all Google products. I probably don't use them.


No, we are talking about online ads company, which are injected to newspapers website and that website shows you the ads. The ads are hosted on 3rd party website. The ads probably contain more 3rd (4th?) party solution from another provider... That's how ads on youtube [spread malware months ago]( 
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:58:50
They are not struggling, they don't make money on ads anymore but on psychological profile of people, on tracking, injecting 3rd party scripts, violating your privacy and anonymity. If they wouldn't use cookie-based tracking and canvas-based profiling I wouldn't block them all.  I really hope they will bankrupt.
Clueless, lol.
