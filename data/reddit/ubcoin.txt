Scammers are modern pirates and create trouble for all Crypto World ! Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to deal with scammers because of the anonymity of the cryptoworld participants and the resourcefulness of scam\-schemes.
There are scammers who try to attract investors’ money. They come up with an alleged project \(however, the truth is, their plans end there and there’s no doubt the project will be implemented\), they create a website, WP, find fake advisers, collect money and disappear.
