So, who is going to be your internet provider after the apocalypse?

You are buying an awful lot of drugs
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:22:35
I'm sorry for your ross.

$908 for four now. It's always best to wait until later on in the sale. That's when you get the true bargains.

So how is all of this goinHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:17:52
There's no way am I going to be the one left hodling the bag.
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:08:11

Maybe they just don't want to make it easy for drug dealers, child pornographers and money launderers to donate to them?

Anyone giving these people bitcoins will have no excuse when they end up losing them. Cloud mining (or most kinds of mining) is not profitable. And the referral stuff just reminds me of scam sites from the turn of the millennium.

Despite all the warning signs about Garza, you did business with him and gave him control of some of your money? A fool and his money are soon parted...

Thank you for being a part of someone else's success. Bitcoin relies on people like you who fall for scam after scam. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 09:56:08
HAHAHAHAHA.... Yes, sure, I'll trust a completely new reddit account that has been used for nothing other than to promote this scam...
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:33:45
Well I heard that the both of you were wrong.

Maybe the butterfly labs logo on the icon for the mining software? The butterfly labs logo clearly displayed on the home screen of the tablet? The same model of tablet that was meant to have been shipped to customers?

Can someone please explain, what is the story behind the hammer pic?
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:40:29
far too lazy to google, but wasn't there a criminal case as well, and that he was on some sort of probation (instead of conviction) for fraud? or am I getting bitcoin scammers mixed up?

It's Mark Karpeles' personal wallet address

Translation: Wishful thinking from someone who bought in at an average of $410. The likelihood is that it will crash yet again once the current pump has lost steam and bounce in the $170-$200 range.

Most tablets don't come pre-installed with ButterflyLabs mining software ;) (look at the pictures of the tablets)

MtGox was not run by professionals. It was run by a convicted fraudster.

You shouldn't worry about your own secret bitcoin stash.
1) It will be worthless at some point in the future and
2) You will probably remain single
IANAL
