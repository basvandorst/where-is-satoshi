I'm getting an understanding of all of this now... It still doesn't make sense though... is r/BTC happy that they are named that??
also, im guessing r/BTC must be heavily monitored and censored for any anti Bitcoin Cash posts?

true true, i guess that's been settled at this point

exactly, I want to pay off some debt, but if I do, then my seed money is reduced by a lot, and once the debt is paid and prices continue to go up, Im not sure if it made sense to take money out to pay a debt i could still pay off later.... Trying to find a balance of of both worlds, to be responsible and smart with this

Anyone else counting chickens in here? 
Seeing my money grow is great, I can't help but want to cash out and use some of the money for things I've made a goal. The will to hodl is pretty weak but, I know cashing out now will only make me feel worse in the future. How do you curb your enthusiasm?

How much of the price of BTC will be due to the value of the dollar going down, Im thinking long term
