They're backed up by the full faith and credit of the US govt and you need to use them to pay taxes.

Care to elaborate how the math behind bitcoin provides backing its value? And why does the math behind one coin back it any better than the math behind another coin? Just because a person invents a coin backed by math, that provides value? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:52:30
Not an argument. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:55:25
And the free market will ultimately decide that it has no value, because it doesn't. It may have seen booms and busts in the past before it went mainstream. But now everyone and their mom has seen this thing boom and collapse and people aren't going to fall for it again. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:06:53
Literally laughing my ass off. I’ve been telling people for over a year how big of scam this is. Bitcoin will go down in the history books as the biggest scam in the history of humanity. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:25:31
If you're referring to the US dollar, it's backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt, and you need it to pay taxes. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:27:51
That's not an intrinsic value. Currency needs to have backing and/or intrinsic value, otherwise will collapse like bitcoin is currently doing. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:15:29
Can't wait to see how your bitcoin investment turns out. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:00:18
But bitcoin is not just a store of wealth, it's an entirely different currency. And a currency with no value and no backing has no chance to succeed. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:57:38
A pyramid scheme requires a central entity? I've never heard that before. Source on that? The way bitcoin is being shilled here, it absolutely is promoting the idea of seeing returns. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:18:54
I don’t think getting in or out at will has anything to do with the definition of pyramid scheme. 
I copied this from Wikipedia’s page on pyramid scheme:

It has backing. If you don't think the United States of America is a strong enough backing, well then that's your opinion. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:25:39
I’ll admit it probably won’t completely disappear, but bitcoin will be below $100 within the next couple years. That’s my prediction. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:45:11
Bitcoin has no inherent value and is backed by nothing, so there's no reason for people to buy it or hold it. That's why people eventually sold when it reached ridiculous heights about a year ago. Fiat currency isn't going anywhere anytime soon, probably not within our lifetimes at least. And whatever eventually replaces it will have to provide some actual value.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:41:15
Perhaps you need to learn to read better. I said: 
"Currency needs to have backing and/or intrinsic value"
It is backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt.

"In both **Ponzi schemes** and **pyramid schemes**, existing investors are compensated by the contributions of new investors. **Ponzi scheme** participants believe they are earning returns from their investment, while **pyramid scheme** participants are aware that they are earning money by recruiting new participants."
It has more in common with a pyramid scheme because as more people buy the bitcoin, the more the price goes up. Also, participants are aware of the current value of their bitcoin, unlike a ponzi. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:28:48
Yeah and I'm worth 10 billion dollars and I'm married to a super model.
Look, get this thru your head. My only argument is that bitcoin is going to collapse. I don't care what you're claiming its done for you in the past. I don't care about your stories.
We can either bet on whether or not bitcoin will collapse and see who's right like a real bet, or you can keep trying to have this online dick measuring contest, which frankly I don't care about.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:50:37
What value does a bitcoin offer other than the hope that someone else will buy it back from you at an equal or great price?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:01:27
Sorry but I won't be reading it, I was just trying to help you and other people understand why bitcoin will be trending downwards towards zero over the coming months and years. This will literally be in the history books some day as one of the biggest scams in history. Kids will be taught that in school 20 years from now. 
If you want to come back in a few months or year or so as things play out, I would honestly be interested to hear what you had to say. But I'm betting a year from now it will be no higher than 1000. Probably lower. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:01:56
\&gt; be greedy when others are fearful
Yes a statement made by the great Warren Buffett. Who also said crypto is completely worthless.
It's great you got in and out at the right time, I'm not hating on that. But it is a scam and it will never return to its previous highs. It may see a bounce here or there, but ultimately it will see a downward trend towards zero until it fades off into irrelevance.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:38:33
The value of crypto is entirely dependent on what the next person is willing to pay for it. A commodity like gold, that is naturally rare and has unique properties that can be useful, has inherent value. It will always be worth something. Crypto, does not.

It's backed by coercion. And it may not be moral if you're libertarian minded, but it's sure as hell backed by something. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:12:58
Well Apple is a company, which you can invest in. Crypto is a supposedly a currency. A company can change and evolve over time. A company that looks like a bad investment one day can look like a pretty good investment the next day as new information comes out. The argument and logic behind crypto however, will not change. 
BTW, just because an asset has pulled back 80-90% doesn't mean it can't pull back another 80-90%. What goes down doesn't necessarily come back up again. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:35:56
Nobody doubts that it's possible to have made a lot of money with crypto. My argument is that over the longterm, the premise of bitcoin is built on fallacy and that it will collapse. A year from now Bitcoin will be even lower than it is now. And a year from that it will be even lower. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:26:15
If you can convince everyone not only to use crypto, but to use bitcoin instead of the thousands of other meme coins out there. Not going to happen. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:18:46
If it got that big I would admit it’s not a scam and I’ll eat my dick. But it will never happen. We’re going to see an overall downward trend in crypto over the coming months and years. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:06:32
And I'm sure you're brighter than Warren Buffet who said crypto is completely worthless. Let's not make arguments from authority tho (which is a logical fallacy BTW) and stick to the logic behind our arguments. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:06:49
Btw, I know you're bullshitting me which is why you're trying to have this dick measuring contest instead of discussing the logic behind your arguments (which you have none). It's pretty obvious that you haven't made any sort of real money in life. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:41:19
Here's why:
A **pyramid scheme** is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:22:00
Hmmm interesting.
Well if not the biggest, I would certainly say the most widespread. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:10:17
The people at the top of the pyramid are making by far the most money, these are the people who got in on the ground floor near bitcoin's inception... The people at the base of the pyramid were getting in at around $20k. Now the pyramid scheme is in the process of collapsing. Not too hard to understand.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:34:18
\&gt;You don’t buy for the quick return, you buy for what you believe in
I guess I won't be buying any then, ever
\&gt;Now is the best time
I'm sure I'll be seeing that statement being made a lot here over the coming years
\&gt;But I’m sure since you were born to ball you also haven’t been quite invested in anything for decades.
I'm heavily invested in the stock market and have made a very good return on my investment. The funny thing is, if you applied your same arguments towards investing in index funds as you make towards crypto, you'd be doing the exact right thing and would have a lot to show for it in the coming years. Because it's an actual investment, unlike Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:52:19
You mean twice? I'm just trying to warn people from making a horrible mistake. When I saw how much bitcoin had dropped recently I came to this sub thinking maybe people would be humbled by how wrong they've been. Instead I see people doubling down, saying to buy more. It's literally throwing your money away. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:37:33
The top doesn't have to be defined as one person, as you are incorrectly implying.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:24:38
And there's a thousand other coins just like it. Something has to be rare to have value. The bitcoin concept can be copied infinitely. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:23:23
\&gt;What is your counter-argument against the fact that bitcoin provides a unique option
Let me stop you there. It's not unique, there's thousands of other coins just like it with infinite potential for even more coins to be created in the future. You're depending on convincing other people to use and continue using something that has no inherent value and can be copied infinitely, which is never going to happen. That's why you're seeing a downward trend for the past year, people realize that it has no value and are getting out before they lose everything. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:12:13
Bitcoin and all the other memecoins. It’s all a giant pyramid scheme. People are buying on the assumption that other people will be willing to buy for a price equal to or greater than they had paid for it.  But it has no intrinsic value and it’s backed by nothing so it’s destined for failure.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:22:09
None will succeed. The whole premise is just a pyramid scheme as I’ve been saying. But arguing with you people is like trying to convince a communist that communism can’t work. It all works in theory up your head, but it will never work in practice. You don’t have the foundational understanding economics or human nature to see why it won’t work. And you’re too indoctrinated in the concept of crypto to research and understand the reasons that it can’t work. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:32:57
You’ll see I’m right, it will be pretty worthless within a short time. I’m not going to keep responding to the same arguments over and over again. All I can do is say my piece and let people do their own research. It will be nearly worthless soon, but people like you will never admit you were wrong. Im sure you’ll be full of excuses as to why crypto failed and how it should have succeeded.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:38:08


These two things are incomparable. What are you basing this premise on? 1 oz of gold equalling 1 bitcoin? 1 gram of gold equaling 1 bitcoin? This just wouldn't make sense.


Once again, your premise is falls under the faulty assumption that bitcoin will have value because people will use bitcoin. This is not how value works. The entire foundation of the concept of bitcoin is built on a lack of understanding of how an economy works and what gives things value. You can understand the tech behind bitcoin better than anyone else, but until you understand these foundational economic principles you won't see why bitcoin will ultimately be worthless. 


No it has value because it's backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. If the united states govt were to collapse, so would its currency, regardless of how many people were using it.


No, the number of people using it is falling and falling. That's why there has been in 80% drop in the price of bitcoin over the past year. It will never recover from this.

\&gt;I can’t lose money, everything is free
Are you trying to say that this money you've made is somehow worth less than other types of wealth because you earned it by high-risk investing? I'm not sure what your point is. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:31:24
Did you just say a pyramid scheme benefits no one at the top? That's literally the defining feature of a pyramid scheme and I think you absolutely do need to google that if you don't understand that. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:22:54
A house will have value regardless of economic growth. You can build a cabin in the woods for you to live in, far from society with no expectation of selling it, and it will provide the value of shelter. Bitcoin offers no such value. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:01:28
But bitcoin is a currency (supposedly), not an investment. A real investment has value, unlike bitcoin. I actually do a lot of investing, and have been for years. You actually have some pretty flawed ideas when it comes to investing. If you consider any money you've made off an investment "free money", that's a really dangerous outlook, and I've seen people literally lose hundreds of thousands of dollars operating under this premise. Money is money. whether you found it on the street, or took years of hard work to earn, it has the same value and should be treated with the due diligence. Let's say you put a $100k into a stock and it goes to a million dollars. You take out the initial investment of 100k, and then the stock drops to zero. it's the same thing as losing $900k. You had that money, and then you lost it. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:20:14
How does bitcoin break that cycle? You would really need to elaborate on that. 
And are you suggesting that the success of bitcoin relies on convincing people to buy bitcoin based on this alleged inherent value?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:16:01
Look, just tell me how much bitcoin you own and how long you plan to hold it for. Then, let's talk a year from now and we'll see who was right. This is one of the rare cases where your thesis is entirely provable within a relatively short time span. If it's up, or if it's even close to the same as it is now, I'll admit you're right and upvote all your comments.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:39:18
No because stocks are an investment, you are buying a piece of a company which provides value. Crypto is supposedly a currency, and it has no intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:36:41
If you believe the US govt is going to collapse anytime soon, then you would not have faith in the currency. In which case, by all means buy all the gold you can now. (not bitcoin which is worthless). But I don't believe the value of the dollar is going to collapse anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:37:00
God you're pathetic.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:26:52
Those little pieces of paper are backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt, and you need them to pay taxes. What's bitcoin backed by?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:29:03
So now it's high risk? Setting yourself up for excuses for when it crashes even more I see. You'll be telling yourself it was a calculated risk, and the fact that you lost all that money was always a possibiitly and nobody really could have seen it coming. It was a coincidence that people warned you it was a scam, and that it collapsed into irrelevancy. But they couldn't have really known that. No, you were the smart one for taking the high risk, cause it could have paid off so big. it would have been stupid not to have taken that risk. Just keep telling yourself that and it will provide much needed comfort for the coming years ahead.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:17:52
How much bitcoin do you own and how long do you plan to hold it? Do you think it will be higher, lower, or the same a year from now? I want to come back a year from now and you tell me then that you still believe in this. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:21:26
I might buy some when it goes to $1 just for shits and giggles. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:11:52
The inherently flawed concept behind cryptocurrency such as bitcoin will always remain the same. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:14:53
No, because all those things are dependent on a growing economy that provides people with value. Bitcoin solely relies on convincing someone else to buy it at a higher price than you did. But without the expectation that someone else will buy it back from you, a bitcoin offers zero value.  Unlike a house, which has intrinsic value because you can live in it, a bitcoin offers no intrinsic value.
