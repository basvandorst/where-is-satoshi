...and spread your ass cheeks?

Meh, it'll probably peak at 25k before the end of the year.

That last sentence will haunt my dreams for all eternity.

I really don't see how there is a floor. It's literally propelled by the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of many. If there is a floor it's probably $1. That'll be the last Hodl'r and he/she will only be hodling for nostalgic purposes.

It would probably be more appropriate if all the altcoins were in the rail cars behind btc.

The truth is no one knows the projected value of Bitcoin. The only way you'd be able to find out is if you built a time machine and traveled into the future. Unfortunately, by the time you figure out the future value of Bitcoin, you will realize that you can't travel back in time due to the constraints of the space time continuum. This will soon be followed by the sudden realization that all your family, friends, and girlfriend(s) are all long gone due to the alien invasion. After much crying and grieving in the hopeless and dark abyss, that was once Earth, you realize one thing. You'll never have to pay off that damn $100,000 student loan and that's when you break out into your happy dance.

If you don't want trouble with the tax man, then yes. You should keep a record of all your gains and losses.

God, I hate those midgets!

I would argue it does have value, you just can't perceive it.

Did you mean to say "over" or that you're getting an "uber"?

Wasn't this guy on Game of Thrones?

So, you're saying it's better to be more like you, which appears to be the opposite of rich and successful?

No, no. 8k simply will not do! We need 10k+ to give the miner's higher margins.

It can only get to zero if everyone sells it to someone else for zero. Last time I checked, people aren't in bitcoin for charity.

Spotted the shill.

3-6 days.

I will be looking forward to using ebay as an intermediary for my sales and purchases. I say good riddance to paypal and their 3% fees.

It turns out some stereotypes about bankers are correct.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:46:02
What "what"?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:35:47
What a clown. Clearly, if there are still people holding btc, the value could never drop down to zero.
