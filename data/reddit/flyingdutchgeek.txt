Feels good! Think many of us have similar stories, maybe a bit smaller scale... Nice!

Having 120K on an exchange I do NOT find extreme. Serious traders need this amount for larger trades and margin. Making small trades of 500USD does not make sense anymore when you have 21BTC. Normally you would have at least 50K USD open positions (short/long) or something. 
I guess this is just a case of getting verified, which might have been smarter to do in the first place. 
Question to the Techies out there: I am using 2FA for authentication, and guess that reduces the hacking risk greatly right?

Come on guys... a drop will only happen when we have reached fork block: 494784. The everyone has collected their free coins and can go back to their whatever alt coin they love. It would be very stupid to sell just before the fork and miss out on the segwit2x coins.

True, 100% secure does not exist in this world
