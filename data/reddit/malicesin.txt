That looks amazing but I can't even fathom the cost for such a trip.  I've looked into DMT and LSD but the comfort of medical staff nearby would allow the trip to be more enjoyable I think.

where did you buy from? I've been trying to buy for days.   I setup on coinbase but it's been days waiting to verify my account.
