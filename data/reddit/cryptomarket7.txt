Obviously a crypto itself cant run for a position... what are you thinking?  
National election vote obviously = political parties.
This type of headline is very typical for elections.  Not sure why its misleading - I think you are just on the computer too much

Interesting post - I have just wrote the world's first CryptoCurrency Sci-Fi book, which sort of deals with the exact same issue (only its a human induced EMP).
Essentially - just one EMP hardened and off the grid computer with the block chain on it is enough to make sure everyone's BTC don't disappear. After the fact - once we are done with freaking out due to collapse, anyone who had a hardened piece of electronics would be able to use BTC as long as there were hardened miners that continued to work (off the grid).  Also would need a piece of functioning internet to work after the EMP.  
Check out the trailer for my book called Revolution High Book 1: AEMPCoin
Any CryptoJunky will love it.  Spoiler alert - the story doesn't really go anywhere with BTC since the whole system is so screwed, but rather a localized CryptoCurrency (AEMPCoin - After EMPCoin) is created to satisfy the local need for having a currency.

Hello - speaking from experience the best POS system for any shop (it doesn't matter what platform you use)
is clearly outlined at:
Full tutorials for any type of system (works as long as you have internet)
Volatility risks also eliminated by having the option to change BTC into fiat.
This system has been working very well word-wide for POS without any issues that I am aware of.

It's his idea - not run by him.  That would be dictatorial... didn't you watch the video man?!  The intention is that New Zealanders eventually run the party via online democracy.  Already policy is editable by party leaders.
Besides, DotCom, if you read and properly listen to him, is a beckon of freedom and personal liberty.

Can you be specific about a 'history of being a conman?'
Most people don't realize that it's the 1% after DotCom.  he is a warrior for the 99% - so it is ironic seeing people who know nothing about him making grand statements against him.  Are you a shill - a 1%er perhaps?  Or just a mindless drone in the 99% who makes claims based on zero research?
Accusing someone as being a 'conman' is a big deal - especially since he has never conned anyone nor has he been judged guilty in a court of law for 'conning.'
