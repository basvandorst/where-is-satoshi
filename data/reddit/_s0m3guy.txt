Yeah this might be it.
And you are definitely right, we can all learn from all of this and use these past experiences to build better hardware for the future.
I too wish everything was open source on the Ledger so have a little more transparency on what is actually going on.
Ahah Electrum yeah I feel you, but to be honest I don’t use Electrum.
Let’s hope 2018 is the year we can have some bad ass tech to protect our investments, from prying hackers and bad actors!
To the moon brother!
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:46:12
Yeah but unlike Ledgers device Trezor’s leak data.
And sure it’s open source, but I want my private keys safe.

Who the other guy with glasses, that will supposedly provide you with a Bitcoin master class.

Here read this...
Per Article: “A more advanced version also exists. No disassembly is required!”
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:41:23
Some part of it are, except for the Secure Enclave that holds the actual keys.
That’s what sets it apart from the Trezor.
Trezor stores the keys on the main chip, this unfortunately allows data leakage (key can be leaked)
Ledger does not have this problem, since the Secure Enclave chip is separate from the main chip.
This is what gives the Ledger bank grade protection of the keys.

Can you try on another computer.
It could be Antivirus, an already Installed Chrome extension.
I got mine from Ledger and everything worked out of the box.
The process for me is this.
1) Plug Ledger - PIN Code (Computer Detects USB)
2) Select Ledger App (Computer Detects USB)
3) Open Ledger Application on Chrome.
4) Use Application.
Computer Detects = USB Device Recognized
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:35:01
Ledger can use 3rd party resellers due to the fact that the software will automatically check the device before it even allows you to begin using it.
Each batches of Ledgers sold, have burned in unique manufacture keys to verification purposes.
This key is verified each time it is used to authenticate the device as genuine.
If you are feeling paranoid, you can check the device yourself to make sure it’s legit.

I tripped out when I transferred my Bitcoin from Gdax to my ledger segwit address and it literally took like 2 3 minutes to get there.
I was like WTF? 
It should have taken at least 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:47:45
Saying it doesn’t even work without background information, it’s like saying my car wont turn on; without saying your battery is dead, or you ran out of gas.

I agree with you in that, security by obscurity is not security at all, but so far no one has done it.
Also the reason why it’s not open source, is mostly due to NDA in that chip, everything else is.
Trezor has been proven to leak data, they fixed it; but it’s still not 100% Secure.
Remember the Secure Enclave In the iPhone; it’s the same principle behind Ledgers.
The FBI could not crack it, they had to pay some hacker group to instead create a modified version of the software to bypass security systems in place.
The Trezor was leaking data by simply connecting it to a possibly compromise computer.
In your example of the Ledger, you’d have to physically steal it, and perform physical chip data extraction.
I think at that point it doesn’t matter how secure the software is.   
Once you have physical access; game over.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:12:25
I read somewhere, that it was fixed.
But my point still stands tho, the Trezor has no certification on the security they use.
And I believe Ledger went for a separate chip to store the Secure data to prevent scenarios like this from happening.
Nothing against Trezor, just like to state the facts.
When we talk about storing possible thousands of dollars, you wanna have piece of mind.

I like how they list Bcash as the only Crypto working right now.
Suspect much!?!

Ive been running both a Bitcoin node and a Litecoin node.
So far I’ve pushed 3TB if traffic combined for both.
You need to implement QoS in your network.
I have a 20Mbps upload so I give 5 and 5 to both nodes and call it a day.

Amazing!  ��
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:09:40
Yeah that's about the average I see on my end too; for both Bitcoin, and Litecoin.
How many connection are you handling:
Bitcoin I have: 91 In / 8 Out
Litecoin I have: 116 In / 8 Out
I don't know why Litecoin has more inbound connections; although I have seen bitcoin go up to the 120's before.
Did you implement QoS?
Is this a Linux or Windows node?

Assuming Exodus and Jaxx give you a capability to "Recover" your wallet.
You would simply "Recover" your wallet, and use the 12 word seed passphrase you already have.
This would technically, recover your private key, and all the addresses associated with that 12 word seed.
Please, someone chime in if I'm wrong here.

**Will Coinbase keep UAHF coins for itself?**
* No.
**Coinbase does not intend to support or interact with the UAHF chain.**
* If this were to change; Coinbase would make those coins available for customers to withdraw, not keep them.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:16:26
I know is wishful thinking but if everyone took out their Bitcoins there would be nothing for them to Cash out.
The people who leave their Bitcoins there, are actively making the decision to NOT take them out and essentially, possibly loose money.
I say possibly, maybe.  Because we still don't know what Coinbase will do in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:24:19
It depends?
Do you care at all about Bit Coin Cash?
Do you care if Coinbase in the future possibly keeps the value of the forked Bitcoins on your account? IE: They may not AT ALL give you the value of the forked coin, either in cash or anything else.
If you answer yes, to at-least one of the questions.
Move your Bitcoins to your own wallet to you can control your private key.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:18:25
Thank you!
You see the value of their service.  
Are they perfect?  NO.
Anyone worried about anything Bitcoin simply take your Bitcoins out.
CONTROL your money.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:00:29
Perfect, I'm glad you are moving them out.  
Get them in your control.
Try again in a few minutes or maybe an hour or two.
I'm assuming that a lot of people are withdrawing right now, I had the same issue a while back and all I did was wait.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:09:03
I would be nice, if you could Sticky helpful threads like this on the main page.
Thank you.

* No.
Bitcoin in your wallet are safe.    
And will be valued at whatever the market value of Bitcoin is at that moment in time.
Bit Coin Cash, is essentially redeemed by downloading a compatible Bit Coin Cash client, and restoring your wallet using the recovery seed and or private key from Bitcoin.
Being a duplicate chain from Bitcoin you essentially "RECOVER" whatever value that seed and or private key hold.
So in essence if you had 10 Bitcoins;
You'll also have 10 Bit Coin Cash.
Community if I'm wrong about any of this, please chime in.
I'm wanna make sure we're are educating; and not misinforming.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:30:21
Da fuq?
What about the hodl'ers holding on forever.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:46:23
Maybe, thats the thing we don't really know.
My point though, is that at least Coinbase is doing their due diligence in informing customer early on about the fact that it won't be supported.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:14:34
Technically yes, so take your Bitcoins out, if you have any there.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:54:16
Thank you, you've presented by point exactly in regards to how easy they make it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:58:49
See, that's the thing though.
Sorry below I'm trying to learn how to format correctly.  =3


* WE AS A COMMUNITY, AS A WHOLE, should take on the job to make sure we ACTIVELY teach new users the importance of controlling their own Bitcoins.


* This rush while it sucks, was created by BCC announcing a totally unexpected fork.


* Advantage of people if they didn't try to educate you what is going on.   But I'd have to disagree with you on that one, because I understand those e-mails and what they mean perfectly.
* They are letting you know to move your coins, if you move your coins no advantage to them.
* If Bit Coin Cash cared at all about Bitcoin and its community would have announced this way earlier, giving ample time to both US users, and Exchanges to make better decisions.
Again this sucks for everyone involved.
I say we should come together, and teach how to properly use this tech!
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:14:04
I have been a customer for 1 month; I have received the 2 or 3 e-mails they have sent now with these notifications.
So I unfortunately, Am not in the same boat as you in regards to communications from them.
Customer support is another thing though, I can say it suck.  
They are way to backlogged, and it just sucks.  
I do apologize if my post was harsh, you've hit on a very important point.
Many have unfavorable views on Coinbase here and in other places, and that's why when I saw you mention a possible class action lawsuit, or the fact that they maybe stealing something it felt like you where trying spreading some FUD.
1) Timeline to withdraw Coins.
A) What time line, blame BCC for not letting US know ON TIME, or AHEAD of time their intentions.
2) Technical Issues withdrawing Coins.
A) I replied to a previous post, agreeing with you on this, they need to fix this ASAP.  But because of 1 and A
3) Cashing out the forked Coins.
A) Who knows what they will do.
B) Take out the Coins so they CAN'T cash out something that is not there.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:39:11
See: 
He understand what the message means, and is now doing the right thing by moving his Coins out.
What he does after is his business, he might Hodl, he might not who knows.
Point being, hes is moving his Coins out, like every one who is unsure about they need to do should do period.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:36:02
Why would there be any legal action against Coinbase?
They are doing their due diligence by letting you know right of the bat, that they will not support it period.
They are even giving you early updates with deadlines by which you should withdraw your Coins.
If you are in fact interested in "Cashing Out" they let you know to move your Coins somewhere else....
This is why we can't have nice things...
And this is why in the end the technology gets fucked.  
Because the users don't really understand how things should be done.
When things to go hell, there is always bloody murder....
They are telling you it's not supported, you need to support both Coins?   Then move your Coins somewhere else, it's very simple.
There is a reason on why you should keep your Coins in your own wallet.
Instead of spreading FUD on a decent company that is actually helping people get into Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc...
Teach people the IMPORTANCE of keeping the control of your own Coins.
