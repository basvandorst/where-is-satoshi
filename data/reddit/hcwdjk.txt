Nice try, FBI.

The [first address]( just received a bunch of "binary" transactions that look like a message. Anyone care to decode?
EDIT: If those numbers are ASCII codes, it starts with "g7 &lt;system bell&gt;", I didn't decode it further.

Another question: why does downloading the block chain take so much time and why does my hard drive sound like a pepper mill while it's downloading?

That's like saying cash tends not to be very secure, as burglars can sometimes steal it from users' homes.

Basically encrypting your wallet with a strong password that will be stored inside your head (and not on a post-it note) is as secure as it can get and way more convenient than most methods proposed here. Just make sure you don't catch any keylogger.

What permissions would be better? It's just a god damn mountpoint.
@_date: 2012-03-15 14:40:21
Especially if you're a man.

I don't think it works like that. Those addresses aren't used up when receiving coins, but when adding a new address to the client or [not completely spending one of your inputs](

I downvoted you for providing false information in an informative thread. Have an upvote here to zero it out.

Your title seems to suggest he would get the real thing if he used cash.
@_date: 2012-09-06 11:42:43
Actually it's just a fake address someone sent money *to* in addition to the scammer's address in the same transaction.
@_date: 2012-03-26 18:11:47
No, you can receive bitcoins from a million addresses to a single address and no new ones need to be generated by you. 
If what you're saying was true, I could invalidate all your backups simply by sending a 100 0.00001 transactions to your address.

They said this:

If there was, there wouldn't be much point in encrypting it. Sorry, but it seems your money is lost.
@_date: 2012-11-25 16:02:40
I think it would, but I never tried it.
@_date: 2012-01-17 20:36:19


The same is probably true for your Nvidia.

You're using this meme wrong. It's supposed to be funny.

Honest question: how do we know it's not a scam?
@_date: 2012-09-27 11:26:27
More like it screams "Bernanke".

What are the downsides of using a lightweight client compared to one that downloads this full block chain thing?
@_date: 2011-12-28 11:36:33
I received a reply 2 days ago:


and it works now.

The way I understand it: 
Yes, they can trace the particular bitcoin and show, that you boght it at mt. Gox at some time in the past, but that's all they know: that you were in posession of it at one point in time. They have no way to show that it was you, who made this particular payment with it as long as they can't show, that the wallet from which the payment was made belongs to you.
If the opposite was true, police could (theoretically) trace a banknote used in a drug deal and arrest you for using it to buy a beer a couple of months earlier.
But, I'm a bitcoin noob too, so I may be wrong. Can someone comment on this?

Try the IRC channel genjix mentioned.

How would you know the Bitcoin protocol or the hash functions used by it don't contain hidden vulnerabilities? You'd first have to design your own cryptocurrency from scratch, popularise it, and then begin at point 1.
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:53:14
I think you might be missing the point of this post.
@_date: 2013-02-25 10:10:16
How would that affect wallet size? I thought it just stores a pair of keys for each address.

Knowing Steam support, he'll get a reply from a bot suggesting that he reinstall Steam to fix his problem.
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:13:10
Yes, I removed it and everything's working fine.
@_date: 2013-06-14 08:35:42
Also, the people who get the joke probably also already heard of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-12 07:31:30
Well, you can take  a stab at proving SHA256 is unbreakable, if you're feeling up for it.

What's so special about java? You can get a virus in anything, from a vb script, through a java applet to a compiled .exe. You can just as well tell him not to install anything ever. 
Avoid running stuff found on shady sites, that's the only advice to be given here.

Some people here think SatoshiDice is the pinnacle of Bitcoin economy and they'll use all their downvotes to defend it.
