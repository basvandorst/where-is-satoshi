Yeah, the "signature" method is really not very useful. Unless you've anticipated it, polymorphic viruses can use clever generation techniques and well-placed JMPs in order to avoid detection by a signature method.
The Heuristic method is really better suited to the task. The success of the signature method is directly related to the extent to which noobs write viruses, or to which their payload is written in high-level code as a solution to security policies.

Implementation detail.


So load it on a machine with a blockchain on it at spend-time, or use a mobile app using a cloud-stored blockchain. Don't have it sit on a magnetic disk.


No, because the paper wallet is trusted in a way that the digital wallet is not.
It's not hypocritical to mitigate the point of failure to spend time only. You're implying a false dichotomy with a utopia where we all have trusted systems and networks. I'm pointing out that any digital wallet has a much longer span of time and a much larger set of failure modes than paper wallets.

The ECMH requires that the market be efficient, which in turn requires that the market be liquid.
On all exchanges except localbitcoins and btcchina (maybe a few others):
    BTC -&gt;          -/&gt; BTC
           Exchange 
    Fiat -&gt;          -&gt; Fiat
The price of bitcoins is plummeting because when you buy a bitcoin on an exchange, you cannot do anything except speculate with them. They are literally worthless until the fix is implemented.
Bitcoins are not liquid right now. Therefore the market is not efficient. It's plummeting because people are running out of USD.

"Imports"? Why would you import it to a digital wallet? That defeats the purpose of a paper wallet.
Yes, spending always requires a copy of the blockchain, but nobody actually keeps a local copy of the blockchain anyway. You can spend from paper wallets on blockchain.info just fine.
But you say "but that compromises it in the same way that a digital wallet does!" Wrong. A digital wallet sits on a system that may or may not be trusted, running software that may or may not be trusted, with an internet connection that may or may not be trusted. A paper wallet has fewer points of failure and a better potential stop-loss.




Not if you actually try to accustom yourself to them.

Sourceforge projects are made by multiple people. For OSX and *nix binaries, usually the main devs compile the project themselves and post the binaries. For W32/W64, it's common for outside contributors to compile on personal copies of MVC and upload the binary.
So the main devs generally can't verify those contributed binaries. Even if they're GPG-signed, it's only as trustworthy as the signer.

Futures are one of many kinds of derivatives.

assumption: Anyone who doesn't use pooled mining is fucking stupid.
profit = (shares of generated blocks ($/BTC)) - (hardware overhead ($/BTC) + power (J) * time spent (s) * difficulty factor (~BTC/(MH/s)) * speed (MH/s) )
difficulty factor' = difficulty factor * (1 + m*(speed of last 2016 blocks))
Basically, every 2016 blocks, the blockchain factors in the speed of the swarm and increases the difficulty proportionally. This lowers the probability of generating a block, which increases the average time required to find a block using constant-speed equipment.
So right now, 1 GH/s produces .6 BTC on a good day. If the swarm speeds up, then 1 GH/s can be expected to produce proportionally less BTC.
Consider this: If everyone, like you, considers the ASIC miner a "no-brainer investment", for less than 2 weeks, until the blockchain resets the difficulty, you'll be mining somewhere around 20x faster than similarly priced GPUs and FPGAs. Assume for the sake of argument that a SC Single at 40 GH/s would produce 28 BTC/day
However, a difficulty reset has a fixed value. Recall that until the 210,000th block, miners get 50BTC per block. No idea if 210k will roll around before October, but let's assume it hasn't. 50 BTC * 2016 blocks = 100,800 BTC, or 3600 miner-days with a 40 GH/s SC Single. Worth 50,800 BTC if the 210,000th block has been generated.
Only 258 people would need to purchase SC singles to double the difficulty. (3600 miner-days / 14 days in 2 weeks = 257.1 miners). At that point, the value of mining will be effectively cut in half- and if the 210,000th block is generated, it will be effectively 25% of its current product assuming you've upgraded.
The upside is that USB uses less energy, so maybe it'll end up being viable over GPUs simply from a power usage standpoint. What is clear is that this is going to make GPUs obsolete for mining, because the difficulty will increase much the same way it increased when people started GPU mining instead of CPU mining.
The reality is that if you want to keep mining without literally burning piles of money, you need to upgrade. It's not a "no-brainer investment", it's a "if you want to keep mining, you'll buy this technology." Difficulty means no long-term profitability increase except where power consumption is concerned. Even then, profitability of mining approaches zero as people with subsidized power concentrate their efforts to mine in their home countries.
EDIT: I don't even need to note that the difficulty increase itself, as well as the first block halving, could produce awesome consequences for the currency market. Bitcoin is volatile enough without slashing the supply in half and putting thousands of slow (GPU/FPGA) miners out of business.

An FDIC-type counterpart, or private insurance?
It's unlikely for an FDIC-type organization to form because the FDIC is dependent on the money being national and regulatable by the government. Since Bitcoin isn't regulatable, you have to let people opt-in to systems like mtgox, bitcoinica, silk road, etc. in order to insure trust in bitcoin purchases.
Banks are insured by the FDIC which is insured by the taxpayer. "Instant" bitcoin transactions (i.e. using an intermediary like mtgoxusd) are insured by the escrow, which is then insured by transaction fees.
The less secure your escrow is, the higher the transaction fees will be. That's how Bitcoinica is going to survive this if they do- raising transaction fees. They have to cover their losses so they can pay out to everyone and still make the rent.
@_date: 2012-05-14 15:14:29
I appreciate the amount of writing you did, because this is stuff that needs to be said.
First, from what I understand the MTGox password hashes were stolen... which is "reversible" in the circumcision sense (i.e. it takes an unholy amount of time, it's awkward, and painful).
Second, I'll buy that Bitcoinica did good when they survive this able to pay everyone out. I remember MyBitcoin and people taking their 49% and walking away- I also remember how most people thought MyBitcoin was an inside job.
While "nobody is infallible", trust in bitcoin is serious. Trust in *cash* is serious, much more so with a currency that lands in your wallet coming from nowhere except your established business relationship.
I understand you're pissed off that I'm kind of muckraking but I think that I raise concerns that need to be raised. It's not about "not wanting to understand anything", it's about asking "how can we expect people to trust bitcoin enough to buy and use it if escrow services keep losing their checks?" 
This is a serious concern that affects all of us- if the most trustworthy escrow in Bitcoin is Silk Road, Bitcoin is doomed.

You "create" 50 BTC every time you "discover" a block. Basically, a bitcoin miner reruns SHA256 over every potential block. When it discovers a value greater than the difficulty, it claims the bitcoins at the blockchain and the chain uses the block.
Recall that you have to be connected to the blockchain in order to mine coins. The work itself is a service to the blockchain to preserve trust. The reason why it takes so long and requires so much computing power to find a block is because it's supposed to require a lot of computing power, otherwise someone could fake a block pretty easily. 
This is why people talk how issuing false transactions is possible if you own more than 50% of the mining swarm- because it would take long enough for the remainder of the swarm to realize you're full of shit that someone could run away with cash.

I mean, this is about to make a 6990 look like a waste of space, and mining is about to get a lot more difficult.
Let me put it like this. The largest mining pool in the world is DeepBit. Right now the pool rate is [3111 GH/s]( The most cost efficient [GPU solution is a 6990, which o/c'd hits 800+MH/s]( The existing singles are about the same price new ($600) and run 832 MH/s. You would need 3740 of them and it would cost you $2,244,000 to run the entire pool.
$119,596 using 4 of the 1 TH/s machine and you'd be beating them. And they make up [25% of the swarm](
So yes, this is going to have an impact.
EDIT: random math error ?
EDIT: the [mining calculator]( tells me that 4 TH/s would be worth $115,626.92 per week today, so until the [difficulty]( resets, there's that...

This is one of the larger problems with bitcoin. People think that if they keep their wallet on the same server as the rest of their system that everything's going to be fine. Seriously?
Keep your wallet on a separate server from your merchant services. The only thing that your merchant service should be able to do is request a deposit address and confirm receipt, and it shouldn't require a password to do either.
This kind of shit is why bitcoin noobs should not be bankers. Mt. Gox has this shit DOWN. This is the second time Bitcoinica has been plundered and they still haven't learned their lesson. What the fuck even? Why did you give them $87k worth of bitcoins to lose a SECOND time?
That's assuming they were lost. Every time this happens there's a question of whether or not it was an inside job- and it can very, very easily be an inside job. You know nothing about the creator of bitcoinica. You know nothing of his new $87k mutual fund. When he reports it on his FY2012 taxes, the IRS will go "bitcoin trading? alright, I guess you could make $87k in a year." and he will *walk away*. This happened before, and the bitcoin police are pretty fucking ineffective even if they have evidence that you're guilty.

1) The bank analogy is necessary because that's what Bitcoinica is. You have an account with them- that account has value. It's reasonable to expect escrows such as them to act with some measure of care when dealing with your money.
2) Banks are insured. Bitcoins are not and will not be for quite some time.
Also, re: security policy, nobody's going to tell you their complete security policy to their website. That's stupid and it's like explaining to your carjacker how to hotwire your car.

Mining a block now produces half the number of bitcoins, no matter who you are.
Blocks are coming at the same rate, but bitcoins are coming at half-rate, all else equal.
People are spending bitcoins at the same rate, but the number of new bitcoins available for purchase has just cut in half.
So fairly shortly, prices of bitcoins will be updated to reflect the fact that they're harder to create.

This. Although there's a difference between getting power-hungry GPUs and efficient-but-otherwise-unsellable FPGA miners.
For $5k I could get maybe 10 or more BitForce, pushing 8+ GH/s. Pays itself off in a little over half a year including power bills.
Also, [demand for bitcoin is going up]( Mining is going to get more profitable pretty quick. In the past couple of weeks alone, we've gotten $0.20 and the [donchian channel]( has gotten a lot narrower (i.e. bitcoins are getting more stable, and growing).
Also, I'm normally a skeptic about bitcoins. I think a lot of people (on this sub in particular) throw reason to the wind and harp about the "spirit of bitcoin". Whenever the indicators of growth are actually there, it doesn't engender quite as much hullaballoo, because people don't actually care about the economic health of bitcoin.

So I'm going to limit my comment a bit:
I'm not implying a 51% attack. 51% implies the chargeback never occurs iirc. If you compromise a substantial portion of the swarm, I think you can pull off a doublespend on vulnerable vendors... so if someone decides to move closer to the single confirmation method, the amount of exposure is infinite once they reach a point where people are effectively printing their own money.
Also, with a stolen cc you have built-in spend limits. If you're attacking the blockchain and you start redeeming all of the bitcoins for yourself, you have ostensibly the entire economy in the palm of your hand. If xyz exchange had 17 million usd in liquid to offer for bitcoin, a confirm vulnerability could drain all 17 million of that.
So yes, confirmation vulnerabilities are worse than chargebacks, when they exist. And the fact that there's no real way to speed it up except to wait for it to become impractical to control that much of the swarm is pretty ugly.
I'd like to see, btw if anyone has stats skillz, a channel graph showing approximately how long it would take for the swarm to notice a double-spend based on how much of the swarm you hold.

The pessimistic perspective is that panic begets panic (which has problems because theoretically if the currency is usable, people will continue buying in order to use it.)
The optimistic perspective is that speculation + slow adoption = inflation.

I do. Anticipating 51% attacks is like anticipating someone taking over J.P. Morgan Chase Corp. for a day. It's not feasible when the swarm's at over 1TH and not worth discussing as a possibility.

Haven't you heard? Real Economists(tm) do this.
This makes the fallacy of assuming that bitcoin is adopted linearly. The overspeculation right now is the biggest bane of bitcoin adoption. I'm hoping people will figure this out soon and start investing in bitcoin businesses rather than speculate fiat currencies with btc.

I'm glad you didn't say it like that in your map.

@_date: 2011-09-16 13:02:14
You're forgetting that trade volume raises price because people are going to hold liquid bitcoins in order to meet volume demand. The price won't go down because demand for bitcoin would go up if an escrow has more flexibility to do instant lending based on their liquid capital.
It's not as effective as people directly investing in bitcoin, but it's non-inflationary, which the market really needs right now.
@_date: 2011-10-06 15:57:51
This. And a few companies have and their ceos did. At the same time, there's no rating system to mislead you into thinking the investments are AAA, so if you lose a buttload of btc you have nobody to blame but yourself for not doing your research or verifying facts.

HMM, A DIRECT RELATION BETWEEN BTC EXPOSURE AND RISK. SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PARADIGM FOR ADOPTION.


And if the market decides Bitcoin should fail in its current embodiment?
The only thing I agree with you on is that volatility would drop if volume was higher. However, volume only gets higher when people invest liquid capital in bitcoin. In order to investment to increase you need volatility to decrease. The "bootstrap" theory is the fanciful notion that more and more suckers will dump their life savings into BTC, and eventually an event horizon will occur. Either that, or the market will go the way of the confederate dollar, and it'll be like a ponzi scheme where the only people who win are those who capped their gains and jumped ship.

And frankly the attitude on r/bitcoin that you have to drink a gallon of multiflavor kool-aid, a veritable libertarian, austrian school, isolationist, anti-finance and anti-globalist suicide cocktail of nonsense, in order to discuss bitcoin is hogwash. Bitcoin is a reality.
If the notion of bitcoin investments being risky makes you uncomfortable, you should stick to your safe, constant-inflation fiat currency. Don't take it out on commenters who have the nerve to make a realistic observation that mtgoxusd spreads anywhere between 0.30 and 20 usd in a day.

I'm glad you're in on this whole deal so you know that this was totally a last resort.
Based on what I've heard, Mt. Gox was basically using the agreement as a way to distract their competition, since they basically acted like it didn't exist.
This is basic business, fair dealing, and trustworthiness.
Besides, since when are people jumping behind Mt. Gox? Aren't they the tacit bitcoin exchange monopoly that just exploded people's fortunes because of "unexpected traffic"?
@_date: 2013-04-06 14:21:52
It's a cryptocurrency. The entire value of bitcoin is premised on the faith that nobody will break SHA512.
It's not that it has value by "agreement". The word "fiat" (and I should know) is directly related to the idea of sovereign action in the modern usage. The nature of a "fiat" currency is that its value is premised on the faith that the sovereign entity will enforce its value.
Bitcoin defends its value by being based in trusted encryption. The "concord" is the same as the "concord" by fiat currency users- except instead of a sovereign, you're placing your faith in the unbreakability of encryption.
Brotip: SHA512 won't last forever.

If we're assuming you have the technology for quantum encryption, don't we also assume that a powerful enough quantum computer is also capable of breaking SHA256 and SHA512?

I agree, but I'm also biased in favor of Max.
I'm also biased against sort of the "convincing the naysayers" evangelism. I think if you want people to use Bitcoin, you have to do more of a "if you build it, they will come" method.
For example, the recent jump in prices has really put the market on the map in terms of market capitalization. It's because of the vigor of the market that people are making SEC filings for Bitcoin-backed funds.
While I think things like Satoshi Squares and podcasts are great, there definitely is this super cringey attitude where people consider Bitcoin some sort of a political revolution- in a super forceful way that makes it look like a scam.
Bitcoin is a technology. How you represent that technology determines its eventual use, just like guns, explosives, and drugs. We can be hunters, pyrotechnicists, and gourmets, or we can be murderers, arsonists, and addicts.

Bitcoin can and does deflate. A substantial chunk of the coins already produced have been lost forever, which produces even more deflation. As deflation picks up, people start to hoard coins, which deflates it even more. Case-in-point: 700% in 2 months.


Cash is still winning because there are no tx fees. As bitcoin deflates, tx fees become more serious. Tx fees are almost 8 cents baseline now, which functions almost like a sales tax.
Cash is also instantaneous. It still takes a good 5-8 confirmations to trust that a transaction has really been completed. This remains a weakness of BTC.


No, you *have* to trust your transaction partner. The age old "whoops I mistyped my address lol" scam has always been a scam. You can't run after anonymous people on the internet like you can some chump who takes cash and runs. There *has* to be a separate level of trust, which is why companies like MtGox exist.


With all the lack of casualty insurance this entails. Say what you want about the federally-insured bank system, but if the bank burns down, your money can be replaced by the FDIC. If your encrypted wallet thumb drive breaks, you're fuuuuuucked.
**What backs bitcoin are the particular niche advantages it has over sovereign monies**:
* Untraceability (more so than cash)
* Non-inflationary nature (the only way the currency can inflate is if people stop using it)
* Unregulatability (can be used in gray/illegal/repugnant markets)
The "value" of bitcoin is based in the stability of the blockchain and on the faith of SHA512 encryption. If either one of these fails, the currency will cease to be valuable.
