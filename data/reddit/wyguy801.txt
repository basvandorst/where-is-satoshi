How is it a ponzi please explain. In terms of referrals it is 100% optional. I'm looking at it as a short term investment in the crypto world, with waaay better upside then there is the down. 4 years my $1,000 will be $1mil+ gained all in interest with ZERO referrals. It's just a simple low(but really high, 2-7%) interest rate that compounds your money WEEKLY! lol I'm okay with losing 1k but key is I have 100% of the keys to withdraw the money I have made. I can do it online in about 5 minutes into the palm of my hand! Quite amazing if you ask me. But what do I know I'm just an idiot who might get lucky rich someday����‍♂️

Not just Colorado, coming out of Utah as well! And I've made some money off of it already. 3.5% the first week and I'm down to 2.5% with the price around 11k but still.. that's WEEKLY

Every transaction they do and approve is approved on the blockchain not their own server. They have multiple investors and affiliates pushing their program. They have money from 52 week contract fees that all their users have to pay for when signing up. As the bitcoin price drops then so does their payout percentages. Pretty laid out all on their website.

I don't think think you understand it's not about what I own it's about what mintage owns. They claim to have 2 facilities in Iceland or something and are currently getting ready for a 3rd I believe. But I have pictures of my payouts and it's all based off of a percentage. People have pulled out their 401k just to make 1-2 thousand dollars WEEKLY. If bitcoin stays around 10-11k then we're gonna get 3% back on our money for enabling them to mine these currencies.

Got paid 1.6% interest last week with bitcoin at 9-11k and am now waiting for this weeks payout which I'm hoping to be around 2%. Bitcoin is looking nice right now!

Start at $1k add 50 a month, annual percentage of 100-250... be my guest and go tell me where your money will compound like that.. and somehow along the lines I heard mintage is involved in slushpool. Don't know the connection but there is one.
