From your comment above: "trolling...**as a way to pump bitcoin**".  That's the part I was responding to.

Not everyone believes bitcoin is going to take over the world economy.  I only regret not buying a BFL mining rig because people were selling the preorders for insane markups on ebay.

"something" doesn't have to be actively used, because that something might have an inherent use.  Bitcoins have no inherent value, so using them for trade is the only way to imbue value to them.  You aren't going to convince someone that a bit of data that can't be used to buy food or shelter is inherently valuable.

Hahaha, joke's on you! Macs can't get viruses ever ever never!

Except gold was used as currency in varying capacities for thousands of years before becoming what it is today.  Bitcoin is kind of missing that part.

I'm not arguing with myself, you're arguing with only half of what I said.  
There's no functional difference between bitcoin and gold, but there is a historical difference which leads to one having widely accepted value and the other not having that.  Yes, people could accept it if they knew they could trade it for fiat, but the process of doing that is long, tedious and unreliable.  
I never said that could never change, but that bitcoins won't be widely accepted in mainstream commerce until they're being exchanged regularly, and they won't have a function/value comparable to gold until they're widely accepted in mainstream commerce.

Why would they be doing it to "pump bitcoin"?  If you've ever read this post is very clearly a joke in the style of their best work.  It's making fun of the only people who would think it was really some conspiracy by Olive Garden or whatever.  Excellent work as always, I wish I got to see the screenshots.

You've just restated everything I said as if it was a counter-argument.  The only difference is that I realize that nobody is going to suddenly agree that they're worth something if they can't be exchanged for any value.  


And when are those people going to be willing to do so?  When bitcoins can be exchanged for goods and services and stop being a fringe thing.

You can't get it with gold because gold stopped being for that a long time ago (which is how this conversation started, thanks for joining in).
As I understand it, you aren't directly paying the merchant/landlord for either of those, so the thousands of people running those establishments have no idea that bitcoin even exists.  So, if those two websites shut down, you can't use it for food and shelter again, and plenty of startups like those shut down, so those two links are a nice first step, but nowhere near actual widespread acceptance.  
Specific problems:
Foodler is for take out and restaurants, not groceries.  That's like saying I can pay my rent Applebee's giftcards because they can be used to buy food. 
Also, your second link is about booking rooms instead of hotel rooms.  Again, this is like paying someone in giftcards.  Certainly a really cool website and moreso for accepting bitcoin, but nowhere near the same as actually paying a mortgage.
And before we get into a fight, I'm not saying that this can never happen, just that the justification of saying "bitcoin is like gold" doesn't really hold up on its own.
