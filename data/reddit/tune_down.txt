Yeah, I finally got a response. Apparently it had to do with me changing my address. They said they emailed me about it, but I checked my spam folder and there was nothing. Oh well, sorted now. 
I really wish they would have sent me an email letting me know my account was disabled, at least. Not fun just randomly trying to log in and seeing an "account disabled" message with no explanation, then waiting over a week to get it sorted.

I tried the escalate link and I still haven't heard back anything at all. Not a single email except for the initial automated response.

I created one this morning, still waiting for a response. I'll try that escalation link if I don't hear back today.

Still haven't heard back from my email so I'll try the escalate link now.

Thanks, I have a job. A family emergency hit out of nowhere and I had to sell some belongings and all my BTC and even borrow from friends and family (which I've never had to do in my life before), but I made it. The details of what happened wouldn't be interesting to strangers, and it wouldn't exactly fit in the title of a reddit post, so I summed it up as "can't pay rent", i.e. all my money is gone and I have to sell BTC to pay bills.

Unexpected emergencies can happen to anyone. This time it happened to me.

Unforeseen family emergency. I was a very early adopter, starting on bitcoin around late 2012. There have been three times since then that ridiculous circumstances have suddenly arisen to completely wipe out my holdings. Every single time it's been immediately before a massive price increase. Something just happened again to clear out everything I have. So I figured I'd at least let people in on the info.

No problem. When I'm back on my feet and ready to get more BTC I'll be sure to let everyone know first before it crashes.
