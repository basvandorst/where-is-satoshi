they are raking in millions with all the fees in transactions and all they do is buy their servers from the same shop reddit does ? ridiculous !

what i mean is stay away from market when such movement is happening , wait for an hour for it to stabilize.

Doesn't matter.. Im strictly using Kraken now, sepa goes through the next day. Im just worried about the money locked in Coinbase. I also see no option to cancel the payment and get it back in my account.

Made sepa payments to gdax, first payment went through in 3 days, 2nd one is stuck in pending since 3 weeks. Im not sure if my money is lost or will it stay in pending forever.

 Auto buy and sell is basically what limit orders do. You set a price to sell for and when someone is willing to pay the price you set it gets sold. Opposite for limit buy orders, you can set a price below market price, go to sleep and if the market price dips down to your limit it's automatically bought at that price.
Creating a limit buy order below market price involves zero fees, if your order is above and gets immediately filled you pay fees. It's the opposite for limit sell orders.
I'm sure some people are using bots too, but I have no knowledge regarding the use of it.

don't know about $, in EURO, on coinbase/gdax i see a fee of 1 EUR for every 100 EUR . So if i buy BTC worth 500 EUR, i pay 5 eur.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:25:43
