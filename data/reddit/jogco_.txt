I think this could be what you are looking for ��
Needs help beta-testing so it can move over to mainnet! Updates will happen on twitter:

I realized since there are so few people using testnet its better to just switch over to mainnet but use small amounts. So here it is! Lightning Lotto for mainnet!

Thank you! I actually stumbled upon your post where you asked about something like this a few days ago :)
@_date: 2019-04-08 08:39:28
I'll see if I can get it included

Aaaaand its fixed! Tickets will now be accepted even when slightly messed up by discussion forums :) (Reddit inserts U+200B characters in comment texts)

Sorry I missed this. I sold about 100 tickets for the first round :)

Thank you!

Yep! But the more testing it gets, the sooner I will feel confident enough to switch it over to mainnet! If you are on testnet please try it out. I would especially appreciate feedback regarding the deliver-ticket-to-mail function!
Btw, here is a test ticket that makes the first person to use it eligible for 1 111 000 tsatoshi:
Just copy/paste it and use on the Claim winnings page. At the moment all payouts are done manually but in the very near future payouts of smaller amounts will be automatic and immediate!

Aight, I made it more clear
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:10:22
Reddit messed up the format of the ticket so I put it on pastebin instead
