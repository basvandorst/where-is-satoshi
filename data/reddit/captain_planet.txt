Bitcoin on Newsnight now... The last I remember it being on Newsnight was way, way back in September when it was the end of Bitcoin, the bubble bursting. Not one of the presenters had anything positive to say about it. Now however there is no talk of tulips and bubbles, it's about how it works, I see that as progress!

You could sell those tulips and buy some originality with them...

The question is though, where did you buy in, $19,000?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:38:34
You got ripped off at $500 in January 2013! You did well selling at $15,0000 considering it has never gone over $20,000, you certainly made up for your bad trade back in 2013...

If you want to get rich quick I'd buy into other coins, which ones however, I could not tell you

I think if you have a small amount of sense you would have made a profit with Bitcoin. If you bought in at any point since it was possible to do so, apart from a few months at the end of 2017 you'd be well up.
I bought in back in 2013 before the end of year spike, i didn't sell at the peak and thought I'd missed out. But looking back at all of the other spikes and crashes I wasn’t worried, it happens and will happen again. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, it’s easy to say you should have sold here or there after the event. 
I’ve been looking at all of the previous bull runs, the percentage it went up, in what timescale and how big the drop was compared to the previous all time high. There will be another bull run soon and I’ve picked a point I’m going to take out, I’ll probably miss the peak and see it go up much higher regretting it until the inevitable drop happens, at which point once it’s fully dumped (or as much as I can tell it has) I’ll hopefully be able to buy back what I sold but have what I want in the bank. HODLers will think I should just HODL all the way but doing this is the quickest way to increase my BTC and actually take some money out to live my life. I didn’t cash out at the optimum time last time but I still cleared all my debts with it. You’ve just got to be sensible and be happy if you do well out of it, you will never get it 100% right, no one can and no one can 100% predict the future price, if they could they would be living on a massive boat.
People talk of Bitcoin ‘going to the Moon’ well it already has… if you bought in when it was $1 it has certainly already gone to the Moon, if you bought in at $100 it has gone to the Moon, $500 and so on. 
In humble opinion (which is just an opinion and may be wrong) Bitcoin has one more big rally and crash in it, after that the highs and lows will be less so. At that point people may actually use it as a way of transferring, spending or storing money rather than just a get rich quick scheme.

Well if you actually like cars buying outright is the only (and most cost effective) way. I bought an S2000 a few years ago, it's worth more now then when I bought it so I've basically had a free car which I love, for all that time. In the meantime my chump friend went and leased some anonymous sh1tbox which tanked in value as soon as he drove it, paid monthly for three years then at the end had to pay a huge sum on a car which was worth next to nothing just to own it at the end... or go back on the leasing machine again.
If he'd not been paying monthly he could have been saving bitcoin, he'd have enough for a LAMBO by now (second hand obvs).
Oh and I also told him he should put money into Bitcoin in 2014 but instead he bought shares in the Post Office (UK).
Perhaps I should just keep my awesome advice to myself.

Can you get arrested for excessive use of exclamation marks?

Interesting, some of the other UK banks have done similar thing Lloyds won't accept credit card payments for anything crypto to "protect their customers" Ironically when they announced this if you'd taken out a Llyods credit card to buy crypto you'd be 4-5 times up!
If Barclays do the same that's me gone, the epitomise what is wrong with the big banks.

It's funny reading stuff like this, just copy and pasted from trading stocks, it's not applicable, technical analysis like this on Bitcoin doesn't work, it doesn't follow what trading stocks does. My 100% validated advice would have been to buy pretty much anytime before Nov 17, and any time since Feb 18. So basically buy any time apart from in that short window and you'd be up. Forget dead cats,candles, bulls and bears.

Lloyds and other banks have banned buying cryptocurrency with their credit cards, supposedly to 'protect customers'. Strange how they will let you set up as many gambling accounts as you like with their cards. By doing this they are pushing the price down making it worse for people who did use their cards to buy when it was 20k. They see it as a threat, nothing more nothing less. I will be closing my Lloyds account, Bitcoin was created because of parasites like the banks, their time has come.

Good point, I would always want to keep hold of some. Other coins have moved the game on and if another becomes the de facto currency used for every day purchases I think the value of bitcoin could be higher than it is now simply from people holding for the nostalgia value, if so many people use another currency everyday then the crypto market would be huge so even a small % share for bitcoin would lead to high prices. Try buying an iPhone 1, it's technically pretty useless but a boxed used one goes for more than a new iPhone X

Seems odd, they normally bash it. After the constant barrage of negative news and spin, last night looking through Google News a bunch of positive stories such as this one appeared, almost as if there has been a concerted effort to bring the price down (India bans cryptocurrency, Facebook 'bans' Bitcoin etc etc), then suddenly they start peddling good news... 
Am I just being cynical?
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:52:29
I'm exactly the same, bought at an average of just under £400, now I feel gutted even though I've made an amazing return as I was close to taking some out at $18k then hodled for a bit longer and didn't want to sell when the price dropped. Seems like it's all out war against bitcoin now by the banks (banning using credit cards to buy bitcoin). Interestingly it coul be the beginning of the end of the banks, i for one will be closing my Lloyds account. This is the reason bitcoin was created, to remove the need for these parasites

You could have mined quite a few pretty easily, you'd have probably forgotten about them after a while as your 1000s of Bitcoin mined would have been worth very little at the time!

What the speculators don't really see is that it has already gone to the moon and beyond, when it got to £1, that was the moon if you mined it early. At £20 it was approaching Mars, £1000 it went past Pluto. At £14k it was overtaking Voyager 1.
