gosh, tried to login to coinbase account today and it again sucked and drops the ball. changed my phone No. recently and it tries to verify login by sending to old phone. There is an option available to do it from smartphone app but app just drop the ball and caused "ERROR SENDING SMS". Good thing I dont have lot of btc left in this crappy account. need to explore others. 
things like quality controls are seems to be the things of the past.

thanks i will try gemini and all others. also one bad thing about coinbase is also they charge very high amount of fee (i remember ~15-20 for coin buy/sell transaction) and they dont display it in their transaction history. pretty bad shit.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:39:24
thanks a lot!!!

Is there any technically oriented good article or wiki on scalability?? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:36:01
Is it regarding scalability issues
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:26:39
like the China stuff lol
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:14:44
i considered using localbitcoin but gap between buy/sell is too high. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:34:42


looks like another L-curve. :)
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:34:22
y not? :)
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:14:58
what is hardware is destroyed
@_date: 2016-06-04 06:49:18
where is the coolness factor comparison??
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:34:53
it vBitcoin ok? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:16:00
i see no such thing as update on either apple store or playstore, what you told me llooks like a spam to me.
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:14:21
i used bitcoin wallet primarily which creates backup file with password under download in android. since i switched to iphone recently, using greenaddress and breadwallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:18:42
what the hell is driving this? it is 3900 now
@_date: 2015-08-27 03:31:57
yes i do understand the rationale. I will comply with whatever it is. But the problem is government's hand in everything public does. Government did not participate in creation of bitcoin but they want the share of it. As if income tax is not enough for them. Electric cars are invented but government wants to tax the miles driven which is against the invention. That is where I having problem. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:01:49
gotcha, downloaded the android version to my phone. will be working on it. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:43:09
it went up to 1000 after chinese government supported it. But soon fell backwards. The good question is how do you manage the taxable gain from bitcoin trading. I just heard government is taxing and it is very complicated. Has anyone done tax? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:21:20
for android it sucks. it has to send sms  everytime i log on. and the sms button is not that evident. i do understand it is sec feature but with too much security, the user themselves become hackers.
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:21:04
Finally i downloaded one of the widely used indie wallet: bitcoin wallet from android app. I did experimented transferring from my "coinbase" to "bitcoin wallet". I am looking to do my first transcaction from the merchant. That would be cool. Now I presume that in order to transfer US dollars into the "bitcoin wallet", it seems like it has to go through coinbase portal. I dont see independent wallet supports that. am I correct? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:39:11
there is a wallet account inside the coinbase portal. I presume you are not referring to it? How do i get that "independent" wallet? Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:29:54
So u think it few months of bootcamping in coding makes u a light yrs ahead of developers. Compared to u, I am more of a humble type that 10 yrs of coding after graduating from 5 yrs of engineering I aint able to pound my chest like u because I run across brilliant minds all the time. Lol.

It must s**k to be Grecian right now. Withdrawal limits of 60$ a day.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:44:32
i believe current rise up from ~250-300 range quickly was that first official exchange opened in US for bitcoin??
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:06:07
I used to but no more anymore. Especially last few years I have been developing real resentment over how banks are tight with their policy but also do concede it is actually the government that is laying down this heavy hand. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:34:54
Then gas powered cars should be paying tax too for miles driven!!??. Come on dude u thought you are not dumb enough that once gas tax are dwindling and government finally finds a way to siphon the money out of new generation of drivers by inventing mileage driven. Before they did not tax the road usage. It is all matter of government tax the crap out of everything they can. Now for the invention stuff the electric cars are letting consumers by way of saving gas which government crushes it by taxing the road. This has the negative effect of  the motivation for the consumers to favor ev over gas powered cars. Ain't taking about federal government in this sense, it is now about state government that trying to introduce this crap. I hope my little lecture had you understand you dumb brain that can't see such obvious stuff as this. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:45:44
that actually brought some business idea. I live in USA but from a country where bitcoin has not been introduced. I am wishing to setup something like a coinbase. When I made experimental transfer between kraken and coinbase there was a fee of about 0.00005 bitcoin so there is a small charge is made so there is some money to be made. But in case if I ever manage to do this, my objective at least initially is not for gain or profit but rather setup successful accepted exchange account. 
Now whether my qualification and knowledge will let me do something like that is in question. I have an EE degree with several years of embedded programming experience and actually recently started studying cryptograph a lot because of my job requirement. But I am pretty sure still my qualification will no way can be enough to do something like an fully functional bitcoin exchange. 
But I will keep in mind.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:35:59
yes, but one has constantly ask yourself "am I really free?" Because biggest baddest form of slavery is tricking some1 think that I am free :)
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:23:56
thanks all you guys for thoughful response and informational. i am still in learning stage in regards to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:41:17
thanks, ye sthat sounds good. exchange is way too much than my current resource at hand. popularize and creating community sounds much better. i am not necessarily for profit at least for the beginning but rather create large audiences. thx.
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:36:39
I suggest you to read some of the fundamental of bitcoin. You dont give a secret at all for every transaction. You give away your public key. Private key is secured in your wallet. Public key is your address, private key is your wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:37:45
I dont feel secure giving my SSN numbers to some unknown person I never meet in my life everytime i have to access my cache. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:00:36
cant wait another year. i need this to 10-tuple in next few weeks.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:55:45
Profit taking??
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:19:59
@_date: 2015-10-01 01:19:08
it is as secure as how well you keep your private key aka bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 06:38:01
Any ideas on decentralized exchange? Sounds like a good idea
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:50:43
what is going to happen if all mined? It means running out of bitcoin money? in normal currency government can print but in case of bitcoin it more seem to resemble gold.
