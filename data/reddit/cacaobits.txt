Nice start. I had been thinking about doing this also.

I am in the process of catching up still. I do know it picks up where I left off when I quit bitcoin wallet and start it up again. So I've only been running it while I can be nearby to hear if the fan it getting louder. If it the computer gets too hot then I shut the wallet. Wait to cool down. Then  re-open wallet.

When I complete the check out process in the demo store using pay with bitcoin, I get the message "An error has occurred while processing your payment, please try again. Or contact us for assistance."

Fix the word coices to choices under the Track section. BitBox.

Checked it out and it works well. Keep it up.
I suggest letting the user know about the miners fee when sending.

As a seller, the MoneyPak / PayPal route can all be done online. No forms to fill out or ID required by either seller or buyer. It also allows the seller to convert the USD to one of the many other currencies PayPal let's you convert to.

Tied together with a site like [Bitcoinary.com]( where reputations can be established and bitcoin escrow provided. This makes it easier to trade without using an exchange.

There is no email to contact regarding questions.
The verification process uses snail mail and fax.
Documents used to get verified must have been issued within 180 days. This is unrealistic since a drivers licence and passports are valid at least 5 years.

Using PayPal for buying Bitcoins is a violation of PayPal's terms of service agreement.

Displacing the banking system with bitcoins requires circumventing the rules that protect the banking vested interests and taking risks to establish new trusted relationships. Start with a small amount and work your way up.

Spelling mistakes "without neeeding to trust the shared coin service" and buttons that go no where don't inspire confidence.

There is also a 30%+ premium in price over CaVirtex price when I used it.

How about a service that converts bitcoins to say litecoin and then turning litecoin back into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-13 13:59:27
One caveat however.
QuickBT charged my bank account $48.62 CAD for .4 Bitcoins
The same purchase via my CaVirtex account including their 1.5% fee would have been 36.946 CAD.
That's a 31.597 % premium. 
Not worth it except in an emergency.

Works perfectly as shown. Well done! Received my .4 bitcoins in less than 5 minutes. Will you be increasing the limit?
Canada may become the NEW place to get Bitcoins.

The justice system will still cash out the bitcoins they seized because the people who make the rules are the first to break them.

It would be great to be able to type in my receiving addresses that have a balance and somehow use the date and time of the transaction to look up what the price was on lets say MtGox at the time. This would give me a reasonable valuation of my holdings at the time of receipt.

There was a craze for Crispy Creme donuts in Toronto Canada when people would drive for hours to the drive thru of the only franchise. It didn't take long before they became available at WalMart and the whole thing fell flat.

I am in the same boat. It happens if the computer shuts down while the wallet is open. I noticed that the computer fan starts heating up because the wallet is using my GPU and gets really hot. This has actually messed up my video card. I cannot find anything so far on Google confirming my suspicion. If only the wallet is running this happens and if I close it the heating up  stops. By the way this only happens near the end of the reindexing. So I've been baby sitting the computer while the wallet is open and shutting down the wallet to let the computer cool down. It's like the wallet is mining though I don't see any setting of the kind. I use the Bitcoin QT wallet.

Thanks for the suggestion. It may be beyond the technical abilities of people who are more use to things like PayPal and the rating systems of eBay.
