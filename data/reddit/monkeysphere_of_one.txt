Should've taken before and after pics of your hymen.

Then who's been buying them?  Aliens?
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:59:54
Yeah, they guy who actually won the 2000 election.

Yeah, I got some bicoins.  I used them to buy two lesbians and a shemale.

It's ok for small amounts - ie no more in value than you'd carry in cash in public.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:15:18
It is, as long as you secure it.

Wealth accumulation is exponential - he was already most of the way there.

I'm not being argumentative, I'm just nitpicking your wording.  Guys aged 20-30 are people too, last time I checked.  I believe you meant 'the wider public'.
