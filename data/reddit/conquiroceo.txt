Sorry I wasn't saying it was a scam. At the time I had not used it and someone had posted it was "just another scam".
I guest the user was just talking bullshit.
Having used Electrum with the new Tails 1.3 I just want to say how great I think it is.
Thanks for the feedback guys and girls.

Any help appreciated.

So as UK Bitcoin virgin and wanting to but Bitcoin to try out, what is the best way to buy. I have had a look around online and see all kinds of websites and also saw old posts dated about a year ago referring  to ZipZap etc. Does anyone have some advice?
All help appreciated :)

Why is this downvoted? Is it crap advice, or truth that irritates people?
I personally came here on the hope of learning how to use Bitcoin, how to store it safely and how it all works.
It seems some people here are up their own arses and don't understand that the wider community want to use Bitcoin but they often don't know how, or are too scared to because of all the myths.
Why aren't more users of the Sub helping the average Joe Blogs become Bitcoin users with some ELi5 comments.
It's almost like it's an exclusive club and if you aren't completely convalescent with the technology you are spoken to like a child.

Would you be willing to make a tutorial on setting all these up?
