Should I remove he BTC from the old paper wallet as well?
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:13:27
Ive paid my dues in telling everyone about bitcoin when it was something to put value in. I cant do that anymore.

Unless you have a TON of btc you wont affect it

The comments are pretty telling about how well this is received in canada. 
A) you have to use a credit card to but them 
B) there is basically nowhere that you can use them 
C) there's no incentive to use them 
D) they don't disclose much about what's protecting your money. Is it on a blockchain? Who has access to the nodes? What if someone gets access to the blockchain? Is there insurance? My credit / bank account has insurance, why store $$$ elsewhere?

$680 is a new high? Are they high?

Who's controlling liquidity? 
Hopefully noone, that's the point. 
Bitcoins still young, wait until the user base grows and the volatility will go down.

Ummm, okay?

Oh god I hope I don't get 0.01 btc :(

It's the new BTC-E chat

They are a small independent developer, doubt its a marketing gimmick. 
Sean or someone on their team is probably into BTC and wanted to try adding it. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:27:08
Could be added in at some point in the future hopefully, I would love to see it. I just doubt the games in its final state

Prefabs? You realize everything is procedurally generated right? Meaning noone has every touched (digitally) any of the planets you will ever find? 
And you can destroy terrain up to a certain depth, so feel free to design a base for yourself. 
Also, good luck finding someone else's cave base let alone another player. The odds are highly against you ever running into anyone.

Hey there, I was a frequent user of your services for awhile. 
Until I realized how badly I was getting ripped off by your nearly %10 transaction fee. 
Now i use circle and pay a fraction of what I was paying with you. 
Would love to use your service again, but please reconsider what you are charging.

That's just what they have shown, and they have said they have shown very little. 
The game is really about pushing what we view as possibly with a game. With NMS you have an entire universe to explore, each world completely unique with unique plants, animals, terrain, ecosystems. You can be a trader, pirate, explorer, scientist. 
Sure it doesn't have the best graphics (still pretty good), but you have 18 billion billion full sized planets to explore, that's something new and exciting.
