this is not the official e-shop. the domain is different (.co instead of .com). be aware!

Nice, thanks! 
btctrip.com is also an alternative for booking flights. And they recently added hotels too.

Kind of. Assume you have a fee of 0.2% and $1,000 in your account. Say you place an order at $100, i.e. you can buy 9.98 BTC for $1,000 (fee in this example is $2). 
After two weeks your fee has gone up, say to 0.5%. Now the same $1,000 would buy you only 9.95 BTC at $100/BTC. But your order of 9.98 BTC is still active. To buy this amount of BTC with a 0.5% fee you would need a little bit more than $1,003. So you have placed an order for $1,003 while having only $1,000 in your account. Hence your balance is -$3.

Try coinmap.org in order to find Bitcoin services in Spain. To book a hotel with bitcoins you can use expedia.com (see  or destinia.com.

At destinia.com you can book hotels AND flights. It´s an european company from Madrid-Spain, I think. They use bitpay.

I mean the payment checkout when you book through Destinia´s website. I don`t know whether the Destinia app allows bitcoin payments...

Could it be that your fees have gone up in the meantime?
IIRC they calculate the fee with respect to the trading volume of the last 30 days. Maybe your fees were lower two weeks ago.

Not sure if I understand you correctly. At the checkout you will see a QR-code, open your wallet app, scan it and send the funds to the provided address. That´s it.

Maybe also here?

Totally agree! IMHO Europeans should support European companies in order to push bitcoin adoption in Europe. Destinia is a great example, since they have very competitive prices.

Don´t forget btctrip.com. They were the first accepting bitcoins for flights and now they added hotels too.

Just finished buying a Nano-Sim Card adapter with an Austrian shipping address. Everything fine. Shipping (worldwide) is free according to their website. And they are using bitpay.

Good to see Austria/Vienna moving slowly but steadily into bitcoin-space!

Did you take a look at [bitinvest.com.br]( The CEO, Flavio Pripas, has quite a good record: [
Unfortunately, their daily volume seems to be a bit low...

If you want to spend your bitcoins for your Valentine from a shop in Vienna, have an eye on [cousinerose.com]( I introduced the shop owner to bitcoin and now she wants to accept it ;). Today she registered with bitpay and is waiting for approval.

Very nice!
