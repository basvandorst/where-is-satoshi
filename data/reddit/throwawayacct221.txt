1. Is it still viable to mine? does it just take significantly longer to mine a full coin?
2. What h/w/gpu/distro do i need to mine? how many bitcoins would i get with top-end hardware? does it depend on the GPU more than CPU? what GPU, nvidia or amd?
3. What is best way to store bitcoins? should I even store them locally? or with an exchange? or diversify?
4. Can i encounter difficulties from tax authorities in UK if i want to convert some to cash?
5. How hard is it to buy/cash out bitcoins? do I have pay a fee every time? How much is it?
6. As a programmer, can i use my skills to make money off crypto somehow? or finance in general (I realise this is a bit wider in scope)?
7. what is the short-term future of bitcoin? how high could/will it go in 1/3/7 years?
8. If there was a global conflict, would bitcoin still have its "power"? would the bubble burst? (you'll probably say we'll have bigger concerns but if civilisation ever recovers, then would we still be using bitcoin?) what if there were EMPs involved? would we all be fucked because optical media?
9. What is all the Bitcoin Futures/Bitcoin Cash split about, i.e. what was the intention behind it? What happens to the Bitcoins that existed pre-split? Do they all stay as "non-aligned" Bitcoin or do they all become Bitcoin cash?
