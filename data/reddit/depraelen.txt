That's a bit unfair though. IIRC despite all the speculation there wasn't anything that was actually solid on GAW until a few days before the con. 
Given the choice of the moral high ground vs hurting myself massively financially by dropping a major sponsor right before the event and probably breaching a contract, I imagine a lot of people would do the same. 
I don't doubt a scumbag like Garza would have milked the contract breach for all he could.

Josh Garza's latest venture?

Actually, he's moved to Hong Kong.

Looks like the same presentation he gave in Miami on Thursday.

No, but he owns one of the more valuable domains in fintech. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:26:55
He looks a bit like he's reading off a script, like he's reading a ransom message. Has someone off-screen got a gun to his head? 
Jokes aside, people really need to be looking at the camera to make this stuff seem genuine.

While I'm normally against this kind of filtering and censorship, I feel it's doing what it is supposed to do here. Over the last 6 months I feel there's been a tangible improvement in the quality of the sub. In the past the environment here has been outright toxic.
After being turned off it for a while I've actually found myself coming back to the sub looking for news, particularly as I've grown more and more sceptical of the bitcoin news sites as most of them have run into financial trouble or been sold over the last year - Cointelegraph and Coindesk in particular. There is a noticeable shift in the direction Coindesk has taken since it changed hands. 
While your post was relevant, I feel filtering of Cointelegraph is understandable, if not justified. The last time I checked the site the front page was quite literally nothing but paid articles.

Just want to point out at this point in the movie he has stopped yelling "HOLD!", is screaming something like "NOW!", to pull up the pikes before the wall of cavalry hits them.
Sorry. Couldn't help myself, watched this so many times as a teenager.

I feel this is the far more likely situation too. The "real" price of bitcoin is more in the high 400's/low 500's. Still steadily tracking up, just not as fast as people wish it was. 
We've had the same thing during past events like the Greek debt crisis - in that case a $130 spike followed by a return to a higher "real" value. In each case, the number of people investing/using Bitcoin after each event jumped.

Lol people having been saying that about BitPay since 2013, they'll just keep altering their model the way they have so far. 
They are still here and still going strong AFAIK (well, since Gallipi's security fuck up became public knowledge in 2015). They had like 30 people in their Atlanta office a year ago, they recently took on more people in their EU office. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:49:51
I found this and the data it points to to be an interesting read. 
Does it use BitPay as the example because they are (one of) the biggest, or because they are the only ones reporting? (AFAIK)
@_date: 2015-08-18 07:32:57
If it ever reaches mainstream, by then they will be sitting on an insane amount of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 07:21:15
Probably thinking about not actually spending any money on it. 
I'm a designer - my experience has been that, more often than not, if something created by a professional looks bad it's usually because of a low budget (i.e. very little time could be spent on it) - or a professional wasn't hired in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 11:25:45
Sounds about in-line with data Bitpay released yesterday about the growth they are seeing in South America too: 
It's tiny volume, but still promising growth if it continues.

Nice one!
Though does anyone find the imagery of a space ship that's retired and never left earth orbit a bit....ironic?

There was a much less well done one that was circulating a couple of days ago with the bitcoin logo slapped on the end over PayPal's, I suspect people think this is the vid and haven't actually watched the link above.

This. 
The overwhelming majority of copyright claims on Youtube are based on the audio track and I'm almost certain it is the basis of this one. If the track is switched out for something comparable there would be no problem.

I'd be curious to know what is actually at that Los Angeles address listed on the site. 
I doubt it's an office, more likely a letterbox for a shell corp.

After the events of the last 5 months, why would anybody go evenly vaguely close to anything with "GAW" in the brand?
Must be hiding under a pretty big rock.

Wow, the hideous lighting and colour editing makes him look like he's ill and villainous - like they aren't even trying. 
I'm not sure I've ever seen a youtube video with 20k+ views and such a high downvote % (guessing that was largely @_date: 2015-04-08 09:14:52
It does. It says in their methodology statement they used Google Consumer Surveys to conduct it. I've been reading about how Google determines what makes an accurate sampling of the population

Brb, need to photocopy my face.

That's BitPay's whole business model though isn't it? Allow people to pay for things in bitcoin, and remove any risk to the merchant. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:45:11
It's an odd place. Check out their thread that's discussing this one. 
I've never understood why people devote soooooo much time to something so negative and pointless.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:18:13
That method would be a particularly good one for getting merchants interested I think. Do you work for someone like Coinbase/BitPay/Bitstraat/etc? ;)
@_date: 2015-09-17 09:48:33
I hardly think the two were related, certainly not directly anyway. 
The game was a huge expenditure for not a whole lot of tangible reward, it's pretty unsurprising they didn't go ahead with it again. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:06:21
It is. BitPay is in payments, not hardware. It would be cool if something like this actually came from something that started as a joke - if someone who did have the know-how actually came along and made it reality. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:08:00
Judging by their blog (announcements) and ability to put together fairly elaborate April fools jokes, they can't be doing too badly. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:35:18
I agree and hope so. So, in the unlikely event that they did go through, Coinbase could use them to hangstring other bitcoin companies? 
@_date: 2015-04-15 13:40:17
Well it *was* during the data period, with so many miners shutting down this year I suspect the numbers will look different if they release this again a year from now.

Just checked back on this sub for the first time in a while to find this. Now I remember why I unsubscribed. 
The negativity and schadenfreude in this community never ceases to amaze me. Do people get how big a blow this is to Bitcoin as a whole if the largest of the processors goes down? Microsoft, Paypal, etc stop accepting bitcoin? Any hope of bitcoin reaching mainstream use fades. 
Hopefully the lay-offs bring them something close to profitability, but that doesn't look likely. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 11:40:41
Any ideas why there might be such a sudden + large spike in growth in Brazil? (Has BitPay announced any major partners in South America recently?)
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:13:05
*Shrug* None of them are particularly good, but like Pirates of the Caribbean people still show up to watch in droves.

Well IIRC each film in the series has grossed around like ~1 Billion USD. I guess if it was leaked pre-release the company would stand to lose something in the hundreds of millions? Thinking back to when a high quality version of Expendables 3 was released, it ended up grossing only like 60% of the previous film. 
That 25mil number sounds about right if you want it to make financial sense to Disney to actually pay it.
@_date: 2015-10-02 09:23:18
I have actually. In January this year in Miami. Garza rocked up late to his "forum" with a security detail just as the conference was ending. It was sort of comical. 
Not that Garzik would ever actually want anything to do with this guy.

Genesis Mining is based in Germany IIRC, don't know if any of their actual mining operations are there though.

Blame aside, I was a bit troubled that nearly every article had the same screenshot as the hero image with the bitcoin payment method and the "Bitcoin Accepted Here" image so prominent. 
Like, Silkroad and illicit goods are one thing, but the association with the heinous mofo's who are responsible for preventing your mom from being treated at the hospital is something else entirely. Like when you directly interfere with lives at a basic level and bring that forward in the public consciousness with a negative association, it's something else again. Luckily, no one seems to have died as a result of having been turned away from the hospital. 
IMO I suspect the impact will be minimal unless these kinds of events occur regularly. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:29:29
I was wondering this too. Doesn't seem like their MO, judging by the article. But I agree the timing is perhaps too odd to be a coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:51:48
I've been wondering a lot what the longer term results of these attacks are going to be. 
For example - I imagine if they happen fairly sporadically the attacks being good publicity for bitcoin, giving it more exposure, demonstrating uses. 
On the other hand, if these world-wide attacks become frequent and continually affect day-to-day stuff for the average Joe and Jane (like shutting down hospitals and ATMs), then does it become the publicly reviled tool of criminals that governments make regulatory crack downs upon?
