it makes sense that it has the potential to be some kind of cult

Better to leave on an upnote before the real abuse begins. Good memories, all.

Posting for responses and informing others are likely the top 2 reasons to post anything in a subreddit.
"just to get a response"? You can't be serious. I wasn't expecting any response [to my last post]( exactly for the reasons I have already stated.
Put me on the record as saying r/dogecoin doesn't care about serious matters.
Don't feel bad about it. Vote with your feet or do something to try to change it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:06:52
Bitcoin is dying. Look at the charts.
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:56:24
You're a fucking idiot
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:57:47
How is saying, "I guess he goes around and tries to pump and dump...", not much worse? I didn't falsely accuse anyone of anything as you did just now, did I?
Pump and dump? I've been holding since early January my friend. There is no need to "pump and dump" something because 1) I don't do that; and 2) it pumps itself
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:49:55
Agreed. We need to learn from one-another.
I'm merely suggesting that r/dogecoin doesn't seem to care whereas Bitcoin at least considers it, even if it doesn't agree.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:02:40
you've been extremely mis-informed. It's not even worthy of a reasonable response.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:05:18
Tip them with Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:57:18
my grandpa gets wires 10x faster than you. wires over SWIFT are instant, I know that for a fact. Banks often have a person to manually confirm it. "3-7" days is just your fraud mechanism. why not just say that instead of bs'ing?
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:32:12
This is, strangely, much more respectful than r/dogecoin offers when it comes to something they don't agree with. It's nice to be able to express opinions, and I appreciate you doing so with yours.

coin.mx, not coinbase
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:48:19
That's quite funny! I've always wanted to be Steve for a day.
Except I didn't leave for that reason, of course. (But I know it makes the joke more effective.)
By begging, as you know, I mean when someone wants the Doge to go to them. I was asking the Doge to go to someone else since I already have plenty.
I'm going to print this shit and put it on my wall. You've made my day, dude. +1
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:07:49
yeah, I know.. wire transfers just take time.
How much do you make on the 7 days of free interest from all the deposits, by the way?
ahh.. nevermind. Nothing to see here, folks. move along.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:57:16
typical neoshibe
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:34:15
It doesn't need to make sense. It's a joke :) Lighten up a bit!
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:49:19
That your post gets a higher score than what is above it is quite amusing.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:32:19
Of course deposits going IN are ok. Now try getting them OUT and see what happens 
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:45:19
Puns accepted here.

I think the OP is talking about a system that would allow for much more widespread usage, not saying that it cannot be learned.
Yes, some of us (and many of us here) know about fractions. But how far would the USD have gotten if milk was $0.0002 and bread was $0.000014?
The decimal placement should be easy and user-friendly.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:34:56
I believe that anything that rises quickly can fall just as quickly. Dogecoin is still looking for steady footing and clear direction.
And when a great % of a community isn't serious or organized there's bound to be 1 or 2 idiots doing something to harm the name (and price). That kind of uncertainty-on-top-of-uncertainty is too much of a risk when I've already made a very nice ROI. 
That said, I don't want to be too greedy and I don't believe in Dogecoin as much as I used to.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:22:09
that would be a family reunion! or, er.. asking if your old room is still available.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:33:43
...and you don't know that it was a gesture, not a real tip.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:28:16
DGC is not DOGE
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:54:54
Thank you. It's very kind

Looks like the exodus of old Doge members [has begun](
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:41:32
Nice words, and I tend to agree. I'm a fan of r/imgoingtohellforthis and others where thick skin is required. I am often laughing at jokes directed at my own people.
But I will not stand for a hypocritical community. Or one that takes itself too seriously when it pretends it does not.
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:05:12
because Coinbase = MtGox?
@_date: 2014-01-31 06:44:22
They are responsive, but claim to have not received it yet. I'm not saying that they are lying but I send SWIFT transfers all the time and it just seems suspicious.
I'll post again here when I hear more.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:42:42
It's kind of sad that it's titled, "Your weekly reminder to be respectful of other..."
I feel for you, bro
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:00:26
Thank you for your kind words, shibe.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:30:31
If it didn't make sense you would not have responded!
