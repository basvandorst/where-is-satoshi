Lots of people took out loans or maxed their credit cards. They have to sell, or go homeless.

Bears are leveraging their shorts and gunning for stop losses to accumulate even more shorts. It's going to be a slaughter.

Bitcoin just lost another 10% in the last hour. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:11:39
Every time you buy the dip, you're selling a short to an institutional short seller. They want you to buy.

The $10k level is being tested repeatedly. With every test, buying orders get filled and exhausted. Only a matter of time before $10k breaks, unless there are infinite buyers. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:36
Yes. Those who bought in earlier at &lt;$10k are taking profit and selling. They may re-enter if bitcoin enters a bull run again, but until then, there's nothing to gain in holding on. Crystalise those profits and stay out of the rain.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:55
I would be. Alot of people mortgaged their homes and maxed their credit cards. They have no choice but to sell if they want to remain solvent. This is what deleveraging looks like. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:13:51
If it falls to $1k, I might buy one as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:20
Alot of algorithms read headlines and act accordingly. If an institution like Citibank says SELL, headline-reading algorithms will trade the headline and sell. Short sellers, algorithms, profit-takers and over-leveraged investors are trying to get out at the same time. It's full-on panic mode. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:40:04
It's worse than fiat. It's scrip. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:26:07
Every buyer becomes a seller when their stop loss is hit. 
Unless you're HODL, in which case who needs a stop loss? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:27:25
Low volatility is usually a precursor to a massive breakout. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:06
Don't do this. Why buy at $9500 when you buy even more at $6000? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:22:22
$10k about to be tested for the third time.
Every time a support (or resistance) level gets tested, it weakens as long-term orders get filled and taken out. At some point, those orders get exhausted and the level breaks. 
Anyone eyeing $7k?
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:51:02
So how far do you think it can fall? I was hopeful when it recovered to $12k, then it just got slammed. It was like a sucker rally. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:10:38
I'll be honest, if I lost 40% of my savings in a single day, I'd puke my guts out. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:08:11
Lots of retail investors over-leveraged themselves, mortgaging their houses, maxing out credit cards, taking out loans, etc. When bitcoin halves in value overnight, you're now underwater and facing divorce and homelessness. Of course you'd sell to save everything you have. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:21:17
When liquidity is thin, it's easier to manipulate price. So the big boys MAY drive price higher over the Easter weekend, but only so they can offload at a better price afterwards.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:53:47
What the hell? I woke up this morning to find BTC at $8500. Wasn't it close to $12k a few days ago?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:38:10
To da moon! Lambos for everyone!
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:47:48
Every time BTC breaks out of $8k, it gets whacked again. Someone's determined to hold it down. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:39:56
If you want to buy at the floor, you need to wait. Don't second-guess the market. Let the whales do the heavy-lifting and stop the crash. 
Personally, I would enter above the $20k mark. That's when you know that bitcoin is truly on a bullish trend again. Before that, you're just guessing .
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:07:23
Now $9800. $10k is not holding.
I don't get it. Why is there still massive selling?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:45:53
It just broke 8k on my chart.
Next stop? 7k?
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:32:51
Good god. Is $6k the next support level?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:37:38
Looks like someone's massive buy order was triggered at $8500. If you're looking to buy, this is a good level. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:25:55
Yep. Professionals don't throw words around like FUD, HODL or 'fake news'. I never heard of professional investors and traders use those terms.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:58:18
Ikr. If 8k can't hold, what's the next level? I remember everyone saying to buy the dip at 17k.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:49:14
A 10% loss in one day. :(
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:23:45
Why buy now when you can buy more at $5k?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:28:51
I honestly thought 7500 would hold. It seemed like a whale was interested in buying here. But no more. I don't know anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:33:15
You should've figured this out before you got in.
If you still don't know, the safe answer is to accept your loss and get out. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:43:32
Why buy now when you can buy @ $5k?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:54:23
It's manipulation, pure and simple. Big money pay these hacks to say something and move price. It'd be illegal in any other market.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:34:46
Replace 'hype' with 'panic'. It's a bloodbath. I genuinely feel for those in the red. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:50:12
In order for bitcoin to be accepted by merchants, it needs to be stable. An increase value in 2% per year is manageable. Increases of 2000% is beyond ridiculous. So if you're HODLing for the long-term, enjoy your 2% pa gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:58:32
Yep. Bitcoin may not exceed $10k for years. Grab what you can and run. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:08
Personally I think all this hype is criminal. It's "Wolf of Wall Street" nonsense. Lots of people have been ruined. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:58:00
So what caused the crash to $7.5k? I didn't see any bad news. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:16:37
Really? So many people are in the red right now. I doubt a tax return will be enough to fix their losses. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:32:12
I'm interested in knowing as wel. They could already be looking for the next big thing. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:59:45

$6870 on my chart.

Whales have offloaded their bitcoins  onto the mass of buy orders @ $10000. Now there's no one left to buy.

Words are cheap. He'll be worried if he loses everything and his wife divorces him, takes his kids and renders him homeless. Do you think women love penniless men? I admire his optimism.

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:27:16
Alot of people invested more than they could afford to lose, sadly. I remember the news article about that Dutch guy who sold his family house to invest in bitcoin. That was extremely irresponsible. No doubt many followed his example, especially as the rally took off. :(
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:01:11
He's right. When a sell order is entered into the market and isn't filled, it moves one point down... and down... and down... until it finally gets filled. That's how price moves. So there's ALOT of selling orders going unfilled. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:05:23
Tether is an IOU masquerading as cryptocurrency.

Volatility has contracted over the last few weeks. Big move coming soon.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:38:12
I thought $7k would hold. Guess not. :/
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:24
It's a full-on panic. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:31:48
USD is 95% off, yo! Better buy! HODL!

I gotta laugh at people who criticise "FUD trolls".
Real investors and traders can be both bulls and bears. Being a permabull (or permabear) is what losing investors do. 
Now, if you think bitcoin's fundamentals are positive and you want to go long, then fine. But also have an exit plan in case you're incorrect. HODLing onto $0 is stupid when you have a chance to salvage 50-80% of your holdings with a proper exit or stop loss. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:11:21
Alot of forex brokers offer synthetic bitcoin contracts to short.

Cost averaging is what you do on the way up, not down.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:30:36
I understand 90%-95% of bitcoin owners are male. I presume alot are married and are being forced to sell, or face divorce and homelessness. Not a good day. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:25:25
Seems like the descent is slowing. Someone's buying above $9k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:00:44
Paper money is backed with force. People may not value paper money itself, but they value staying out of jail.

The cynic in me is saying that Deutsche is pumping up bitcoin while secretly selling. These "free" reports are there to help the bank, not you.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:25:14
Wished that I shorted at $10k. :(
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:23:19
Who's buying in at $6k?
