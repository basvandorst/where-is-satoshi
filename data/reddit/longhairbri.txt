ho hum. I thought they said btc was dead when it crashed from 25 to 12.50 when the pirate scam came to light. or that one time when mtgox was exposed/collapsed, sending the price from 1200 to 450. hell, china has killed bitcoin so many times now that they are irrelevant. check back in a year or two, we'll be funding a kickstarter for a satellite to project the BTC symbol on the moon!

you all realize these machines are for backpage escorts to pay for their ads. backpage doesn't have banking/paypal, only accepts BTC. hookers don't care about the fees

GOD, I LOVE BITCOIN.........and I don't believe in god, or love for that matter!! so to be truthful, I BITCOIN

they are in "metro" Detroit. 
actually, there are 2 locations. 1 on the north end of Telegraph Rd. in Pontiac and the other in NW Farmington Hills behind 12 Oaks Mall-Novi.
Both FAR from actual Detroit, although Pontiac isn't any better

well, as far as my waitress tonight, I was the first patron to pay via bitcoin. I got to say, I got a little rush paying less than a bit nickel for some awesome food, craft beers and desserts. that fire oven pizza is really tasty!
