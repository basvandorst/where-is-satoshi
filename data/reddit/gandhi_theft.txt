Use TransferWise (or similar) and pay a 0.5% fee to remit. There's no need for Bitcoin here. Next!edit: To anyone who is new to those guys: it would only be fair to use my referral link if you appreciate hearing of them. You too can have a brighter, safer, financial future without putting your wealth in wacky hacky internet money land.

Interestingly I've had an account where the documents I submitted for the fraud check had been rejected because one was in French / they didn't understand them / whatever. Anyway, I couldn't be bothered to sort that out so I just left the account as-is and used another exchange. I received an email several weeks ago saying they had, in fact, just accepted the previously rejected documents without any change or complaint from my end. It seems to me like they might have decided they had to open up the system for cash deposits as much as they could, even to accounts where anti-fraud assurance could not be fully completed.

I feel like all of this waiting for lots of confirmations stuff is just lazy programmers causing bad press for bitcoin
