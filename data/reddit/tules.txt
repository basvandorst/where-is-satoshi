Unless you're a dirty foreigner... 
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:35:41
Didn't think so.
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:02:50
"Doesn't sound very peaceful" no shit..
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:29:57
isn't everything?
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:23:29
Balmers a fat sweating moron
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:39:57
[this]( would suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:49:02
What the hell does that mean? How is a data interchange format a scam?
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:29:32
Please explain exactly what you think the technical limitations of BTC are and how a new crypto currency will address those limitations, because honestly it just sounds like you're saying words for the sake of it.

It's not the storage that's really the problem, it just becomes impractical to download after a certain point. Already kinda cumbersome imo
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:34:00
Yeah, I'm not a fan myself, but it's not like people are paying to use it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:19:10
You know I was a HUGE Bitcoin evangelist, but I've been pretty seriously burned over the past few months, and I have to say I agree with everything you say here. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:45:21
Christ. Can we just lynch this fucker already?
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:58:14
Sooo am I getting anything back or not?
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:05:25
Exactly. If anything it would understate the reality.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:22:15
Literally shaking? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:06:23
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:00:01
You can't. the platform doesn't allow it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:04:01
I finally figured it out tonight. Use Coinigy. It's $20 a month, but I'm pretty sure that will pay for itself very quickly. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:56:02
You can't set both at the same time.

In other news the sea consists mostly of water
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:44:26
Exactly. If you were my kid I would be on the phone immediately. That's ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-11-03 08:42:25
It was an exaggeration yeah. But considering Baidu China's most popular website just started accepting them, interest is skyrocketing, and China has well over a billion people living there I'm pretty sure that's gonna have a substantial effect on the market.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:12:36
Oh look another pompous liberal ramming his political agenda down everyone's throat as if it's concrete fact.
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:44:49
You miss the point by a country mile. Can people really be that simple minded?
@_date: 2013-11-03 08:31:18
Unfortunately most people...
@_date: 2013-11-02 09:56:19
That's awesome. How much do you give out?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:01:34
"tacit" I don't think that means what you think it means :P
@_date: 2013-11-03 12:07:54
Baidu are huge. They're like the Chinese Google. I'm pretty sure they don't need Bitcoin to make them popular. In any case, if it drives the value of Bitcoin up and intoduces it to millions of new users what difference would that make?
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:15:02
Yeah. Sorry about that guys.
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:07:01
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:06:44
Well if I want a completely impartial and well informed opinion on Bitcoin Western Union is obviously the first choice!

Did you read the comment before it was deleted? "if you don't immediately dismiss Ron Paul because of his pro-life stance you are sexist" and I quote "*pure and simple*". Paying zero heed to the possibility that his pro-life stance has more to do with taking the death of an infant seriously than simply being "fuck women". 
I'm actually pro-choice myself and have had to pay for an abortion in the past, though it was not something I took lightly; but this was pure ad hominem, guilt by association bullshit. I have nothing but love for liberals who argue well and respectfully but guys like this are doing nothing at all to help your cause. And without trying to provoke any further conflict, in my experience it does more often tend to be the Liberals rather than the Libertarians who are absolutely militant about their views and prone to jumping to conclusions about their opponent.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:53:44
Thanks. Appreciate the tip.
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:26:12
Fuck yeah. That's enough incentive for me to actually buy their tea!
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:46:56
Not regulations per se but I'm pretty sure major finance news outlets have tried to discredit Bitcoin, jumping all over any problems it's had, as if to say "we told you so". Also haven't the authorities seized the assets of various major bitcoin exchanges?
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:20:54
So take your business elsewhere. Fuck 'em. Thanks for publicizing this dude. They will NOT win this one.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:45:44
I would like to see the follow up to this if they reply
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:22:59
A very insightful reply, I appreciate that.
Also agree 100% with what you said at the end.
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:40:46
[it's happening!](
@_date: 2013-11-03 10:14:07
I could give a fuck dude. The point I was making is more than valid
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:09:21
...and to the downvoters: if you can't tell the difference between a small independent company of growers and a massive multinational conglomerate you must be borderline retarded. Or if you are not aware of the implications that Bitcoin has for bypassing the financial corporations I'm surprised you are even on this sub.
@_date: 2013-11-03 10:50:25
This is actually pretty informative, and importantly not unnecessarily hostile, thanks. Of course all tech giants are run on a similar basis. I think by now though, the project could be considered successful and has of course made international news, so it's probably safe to say that Baidu is backing bitcoin. China are driving a lot of the new growth.
@_date: 2013-11-03 08:35:08
It is high risk. But I'd say half the population of China moving into bitcoin is just enough assurance to justify that risk in my mind. This is just the nature of speculative investment. If you wanna play it safe go buy bonds, but don't be disappointed when you're barely beating inflation 10 years down the line.
