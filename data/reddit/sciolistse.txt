Klarnas CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski expressed his dislike of the digital currency Bitcoin in February. His company has now built a solution which opens up Bitcoin purchases for the majority of Swedish E-Commerce sites.
This new solution is intended to work on any site in the country which uses Klarnas payment system "Checkout".
Checkout currently processes about half of the companies volume. Among their customers are bookstore Adlibris, sporting goods retailer Sportamore and a large amount of popular clothing stores.
Klarnas management have stated that their bitcoin payment implementation is technically near launch. Before release Klarna must ensure that their solution does not violate the EU:s money laundering directives and consumer protection requirements.
"We want to launch, but we will not proceed until we are certain that we can offer our customers the same degree of safety offered by our other payment methods. We are preparing for discussions with our lawyers to examine how our payment method can be adjusted to conform to laws and regulations", says Klarnas communications manager Erik Engellau-Nilsson.
Klarnas CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski has previously stated that he did not see potential for bitcoin as a means of payment.
In an interview with Bloomberg in February, he stated that Klarna did not have any plans to process bitcoin payments.
"In our opinion bitcoin is in a bubble. I see no practical applications which are interesting at scale", was what Sebastian Siemiatowski had said at the time.
Now he has changed his mind on the option of allowing bitcoin payment.
"I am still skeptical about bitcoins future but this solution should be seen in a different light. We are interested in offering any popular means of payment, whether that means invoicing, credit cards or bitcoin. Anything we can do to help our customers sell more online", says Sebastian Siemiatkowski.
He goes on to say that Klarna has built a platform which will allow them to cheaply and easily test any kinds of new payment methods.
"If it had cost us hundreds of thousands (USD), we would never have been able to prioritize testing bitcoin. However, we have created a technical flexibility which enables these kinds of experiments at reasonable cost", says Sebastian Siemiatkowski.
Earlier this week, the American E-Commerce giant Ebay's daughter company Braintree's management announced their intention to build a similar solution for bitcoin payment.
Ebay also owns Paypal which is Klarnas largest competitor in their effort to expand to the USA.
