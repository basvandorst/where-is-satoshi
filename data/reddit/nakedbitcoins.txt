Cool stuff .
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:12:53
Good question.
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:59:02
Great job!
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:38:53

@_date: 2016-03-05 23:16:49
The last I heard was 1 month or so.
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:48:44
Thanks for the mention. We'll be adding more content shortly to the website. The whole goal is to have everything from mainstream girls to every day girls earning Bitcoin. I'm also looking forward to showing you the stats from the current clips.
**edit:** Starri Knight will be on 7 p.m PST [Camalot]( a streamium based camming website.
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:24:52
Ah yes a sites that review other Bitcoin related sites.
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:45:41
Good little blog!
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:51:39
I didn't even know you couldn't buy it with BTC ? odd.
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:42:25
Then you won the interwebz....lol
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:57:00
I do like that idea :)
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:43:57
A simple code tied to your Bitcoin address that you can spend on peoples website instead of QR's/and long BTC addresses maybe.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:43:09
Excellent! :)
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:29:04
Got it also.
@_date: 2016-01-09 22:06:04
Yes. That would work also. Basically, it can activate whatever service you use ( Coinbase, Circle, QT etc.etc ) or another way is to have precodes already paid for and merchants then just load them up on their site. So, users sign up for this service we are talking about and are given a bunch of codes upon that signing up and on the other side merchants who sign up to the service are privy to those codes also. Whenever said codes are used , it will automatically deduct from users account on whatever amount the merchant is asking for said products.
@_date: 2016-01-02 09:20:28
Love it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:12:36
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:06:06
Someone say girls? Lol
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:09:38
Why not lol
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:48:02
Keep in mind this is still Beta ,but go ahead and spin some clips for a small BTC price and help support the girls. We'll be adding new content daily going forward. We offer a "free preview" and if you want to see the whole clip just send over a few bits of Bitcoin to spin the clip.
Feel free to add us on Twitter! 
Thanks for reading.
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:49:04


lol good point.
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:22:04
Of course there will always be free. Some people like to support the BTC economy.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:41:38

What [Coinbase]( just posted:
*Reddit but with Bitcoin: Reddit uses the concept of “karma points”. But what if these were replaced with bits? People could earn money for posting good content or adding comments. Many different global communities (or would they be economies?) could emerge, made of of people in different countries all over the world .*
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:32:42
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:45:10
