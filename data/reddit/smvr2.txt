Really, you can trade many things or fiat currencies for BTC and other Cryptos, Electronics, Gift Cards. 
Oh and if you didn’t know fiat currency is the government issued currency like the United States Dollar.  
So lets get down to it, you can trade BTC or Cryptos for USD or any other currencies by using centralized exchanges like Coinbase, in these websites you can buy cryptos with money, the problem is that these exchanges require you to put in your SSN or id according to laws of different countries. 
So if you don’t want to do this you still a lot of options.
1.P2P exchanges, one great P2P exchange is Local Bitcoins, you have a lot of options on this site, Wire Transfer for BTC, Paypal, Vanilla gift cards and even in person.
And when you are trading your BTC is held in escrow for 10 Mins so the payment can be confirmed.
Cons to this site is hacking, their has been a hack on their site today.
And another is scams.
Honorable mention is CardCoins.co, you can trade prepaid gift cards for BTC
Another are subreddits that offer Gift Cards or Cash for BTC or others, some good ones are r/gift card exchange and r/Cash4Cash.
Now my experience was finding a random guy on reddit who scammed me.
 2.Work for Bitcoin/Cryptos
Are you fluent in another language, well you can offer translation services and even more jobs on r/ Jobs4Bitcoins or Coinality
3. You can go on ebay or other sites and sell your electronics for BTC, a little bit harder however.
One more thing, if you are trading Fiat to Crypto you will have to deal with putting in your SSN
but dealing Crypto to Crypto does not require this, but you are going to need crypto in the first place.
And so that is my story of trading and this is how you can trade.

@_date: 2019-01-19 19:51:56
No, I mean that a government shouldn’t use it as its currency, you can use BTC whenever you want, but for a gov’t to not have control over its currency is stupid.

You can disagree with me, thats the point of free speech, but when you disagree with me, can you have legit criticism.
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:04:31
What the Fuck, what the hell is beam, and I don’t exactly get what I am lying about.
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:58:22
I am not challenging your right to use Bitcoin, but a government using would be unwise
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:05:50
Um, what, think about what you said, if the US didn’t regulate the dollar, how would it even function, and people do not devalue their currencies, governments do idiot. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:43:08

Basically I got a Visa Gift Card from my employer and I wanted to bring it to good use, Bitcoin, I don’t want to give away my personal info and my Visa Gift Card doesn’t have much money so I can’t put in much money.

What about an exchange that is not p2p.
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:06:14
Your explanation is as bad as your grammar
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:59:21
This is exactly what I am talking about, good job proving my point.
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:50:22
I am going extremely niche here
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:09:04
Well the only job i will ever be able to get is at a McDonald’s or Walmart, I will never amount to anything.
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:28:26
This might sound cliche but I dont think I’m good at anything, and I don’t have much to sell.
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:26:18
Yes, I agree with your opinion, people on Bitcoin subreddits have been complaining about “BTC not being Mr. Nakamoto’s vision”, but Bitcoin isn’t owned by him, it was simply his brainchild that he released upon the world with his instructions, not knowing where it would go.
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:31:55
Then whats the point of Crypto, if i have to give away my identity
