21Inc.'s business model relies on consumers purchasing IoT devices and mining at a loss.  With their industry-leading efficiency (0.16W/Gh) and negative marginal operating expenses (they pay $0 electricity because the consumer picks up the tab), if enough 21Inc devices are deployed it will put every single other mining company and manufacturer out of business because they simply won't be able to compete.  That means 21Inc has a monopoly on mining and grabs &gt; 51%.
ELI5 how this is good for Bitcoin and decentralization ?

*Could*. Monopolies are hard to unseat.  Especially if they sign exclusive contracts with one of Intels 14nm foundries.  They have enough money to solidify a monopoly.

From Vitalik at 
So I did the math on the technical specs.
Revenue: 80 GH/s (taking the approximate average of 50 and 125) / 254843393046703243264 network difficulty (that's 59,335,351,234 difficulty multiplied by a baseline of 232 as bitcoin difficulty is measured in multiples of 232 ) * 86400 seconds per day * 25 bitcoin block reward gives 0.0006780634880666976 BTC = $0.15 per day.
Cost: 0.16 J per GH * 80 GH/s gives 12.8 J/s = 12.8 watt seconds per second = 12.8 watt hours per hour = 0.0128 kWh per hour = 0.30 kWh per day = ~$0.045 per day at 15 cents per kWh.
So you're paying $399 upfront and getting $0.105 per day or $38.3 per year, and this is before taking into account network difficulty increases, the upcoming block halving (yay, your profit goes down to $0.03 per day!) and, of course, the near-100% likelihood that you won't be able to keep that device on absolutely all of the time. I seriously hope they have multiple mining chips inside of their device and forgot to mention it; otherwise you can outcompete this offering pretty easily by just preloading a raspberry pi with $200 of your favorite cryptotokens.

You're right it's not a mining device, its even more useless than that.

The Giant mining pool.  That sounds great for Bitcoin.

1. More people on associate the word "ledger" with blockchain, NOT the UTXO set. 
2. This is because "ledger" fits the definition of a blockchain better than the UTXO set. It's the word that Andreas, the media, and just about everyone else except for you associate with 'blockchain' for the general population.
3. Blockchain and Ledger *are* synonymous, as they should be, and nobody should be corrected as to their understanding of either word.
4. Just because you have a personal opinion, it does not mean it is correct.
5. As an example, you had an opinion with the way development should be going and others didn't agree with you, so you threw a temper tantrum and launched XT, ostracizing yourself from the community in the process.  You were wrong then, and you are wrong now on this topic.
6. Learn how to communicate better with others.  Especially people with deep knowledge of economics and cryptography.
7. If you don't like to say you need a copy of the 'UTXO set', just say you only need a copy of 'spendable transactions'.  People who haven't seen the term 'ledger' before won't know that it refers to the set of 'spendable transactions'. Spendable transactions is much more descriptive, and does not use a word that already is synonymous with the blockchain (ledger).  Common sense.  
8.  Nobody calls the UTXO set the 'ledger', nor should they start doing so.
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:47:19
Why don't you call the 'ledger' the 'UTXO set' so people know what you're talking about?  Or are you trying to obfuscate on purpose? It's common knowledge that most people (andreas fanboys included), think that 'ledger' and 'blockchain' are synonymous

No. Because mining pools cost $0 to start up so competition is easy.  21 Inc's cost $120 Million to start up, so monopolies are easy.
Comparing apples to oranges. But nice try.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:39:15
No. The mining chip costs them $5. 
1.8 million of these in IoT devices will gain 51% of the network.

Buy a 21 Bitcoin Computer for $400. Plug in a wait a few days...
@_date: 2015-09-29 10:59:05
THIS.  XT is the largest attempt so far for an aggressive minority to take over bitcoin through social means. (Reddit, etc), and failing miserably. 
Mike Hearn is a master troll.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:54:06
Their chips will soon be in devices that cost $40, like wifi routers. Not just these dev kits.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:50:45
Wow. Great post, Vitalik clearly explains how silly 21Inc's model is.
The Ethereum guys are planning on a PoS chain that will handle 10,000 transactions per second with 2-3 second block times.   I wonder how bitcoin will respond.
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:13:08
The fact that they also have to start defending themselves on this point means that everyone knows it's a serious issue.  And why don't they let the public know what their "long term road map" is going to address this serious centralization issue?  They just want to tell Peter in person in a closed door meeting where they can give him a few hundred grand to 'consult' for them and stay quiet?
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:30:29
If not "enough 21Inc devices" are deployed, that would be a good thing.  If enough are deployed that would be bad.  What I'm wondering is why we see so much support for 21Inc when it's success would lead to centralization?  It's a contradiction.
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:17:06
Good fucking point. Didn't even think of that.  If there's competition, the model doesn't work.  If there isn't competition, then 21Inc wins 51% of the network.
This is so obviously a lose-lose for Bitcoin I'm shocked to see so much support behind it.  Cognitive dissonance here is amazing.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:33:58
0.5% of hundreds of thousands?  Just put in $1 and it will make it into next block.   Percentage of total is a *bad* idea.

Coinkite is well known to use Shill accounts to upvote their own posts.
They have been caught red handed in the past with all the fake accounts and twitter followers. 
Also, This anncouncement and coinkite's don't mean anything. TX volume in BTC costs near $0 to fake.

This is awesome. If you can sum this up weekly, I'd be happy to tip.

Link between addresses and IP.....  So that's basically all the important information.
