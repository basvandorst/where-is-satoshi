You don't understand economics very well do you?

Trillion dollar student debt bubble would like to say otherwise. Yes, some of the debt and some of the schools are private, but most the schools are public and a huge portion of the debt (if not most, dont have the numbers in front of me) is govt-loans, which counts a public education.

All that a savings glut implies is that there is nothing that seems like it is worth investing in or purchasing
Come up with something worth investing in that is attractive to BC users and blamo there you go.
Perhaps a bitcoin fund for spreading bitcoin's popularity, getting online vendors to accept bitcoin, etc. if we really want this to become an actual form of exchange, well then
1) it needs to be simple and easy to transact in bitcoin
2) it needs to be simple and easy to exchange bitcoin into other currencies
3) there need to be lots of goods and services for people to actually buy.
think about it this way: what is more useful; a web of frequently transacting resources you can access, or a bunch of digital coins on your computer just sitting there?
if bitcoin is your savings plan you are insane. the whole thing could easily be declared illegal. however, if it is instead widely used, making it illegal will be very difficult. the people who are hoarding right now have the most to lose from this all suddenly being declared illegal. thus, they have the most to gain by doing something to promote bitcoin popularity. i dont know if this is yet realized though, haha
