Do you mean Poloniex? The API there seems interesting, but I've read quite a lot of negative reviews on them. Are you trading there?

Bitcoin is anarchy to banks. The crypto currency community is (rightfully) proud of this but struggles with the consequences anarchy brings with it. I agree with your point. If Bitcoin is not strong enough to survive this, it certainly isn't strong enough to survive governmental control and regulation.

If you use Electrum on a PC facing the Internet, it is as insecure as any other wallet. For long time storage, one should generate a wallet on a clean, offline computer and encrypt the keys. (In this case, you could use Electrum or any other established wallet app.)

The success of Bitcoin is certainly not bound to the amount of investors interested in buying it. It is a free, open, unregulated form of currency, which in itself has more benefits than I could possibly list here. Bitcoin is no pyramid scheme, it's a paradigm shift.

Quantum computing, massive international regulation (stops wide-spread adoption), alternative (possibly improved) protocols taking hold and so on. I do not fear any of them, but one should be aware of this. Personally, I'm hodling harder than Hodlor.

Never send your private key to anyone. This is certainly a ripoff.

Wow, ok, that is a strong reason not to use Poloniex. Good support is a must. Thanks!

Don't embarrass yourself. You know it's will be off by $37.456. Jesus, get your projections right man.

The term "hodl" comes from a forum post. The poster intended to write "hold your bitcoins" but wrote "hodl" instead. It simply means: don't sell your coins during dips.

The research and progress in quantum computing over the last couple of years was quite good. Fact is, quantum computing can and will have a lasting effect on public-key cryptography. Consider this: if a quantum computer can break the underlying algorithms of Bitcoin, it will heavily disrupt Bitcoin as we know it. Even if the algorithms are exchanged, there will be a period where individuals with enough resources might be able to steal coins or fake transactions. Unless, of course, the protocol is updated in advance.

Bread wallet and cold storage. This is legit.

Bitaddress.org is a cool project. I like to be in control of the keys and it's quite easy to easy. (Make sure to not use the online version; instead, download it and generate your keys offline.)

Banks are regulated and dictate rules on how to transfer or receive money. The very essence of Bitcoin is its decentralized, unregulated nature. If a bank supports (or claims to support) Bitcoin in any way, it might not be of benign reasons.

That sounds great! I work in IT Sec myself and having a solid security team on an exchange is quite important.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:32:48
When you start to code, you want to tackle cool problems. I've been there. But trust me (and all the others pointing this out): I've been a programmer for 15 years, have a Master's degree in Computer Science and IT Sec, and even I wouldn't dream to do this alone. Build up a solid foundation first.

Thanks for the reply! Do you have personal experience with Bittrex? I've looked into their API docs and it looks quite promising. Thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:44:15
Do you know how to prevent CSRF attacks in your application? Can the mechanism to send out Bitcoin from your "bank wallet" be triggered repeatedly without validation? With arbitrary amounts? Surely you plan to prevent Cross-Site Scripting.
Will you store the private key to your "bank wallet" on your web server? Or the security tokens to the Coinbase API? If so, do you know the security standards of your hosting company? Can the private key or the security token be leaked somehow?
If you do not instantly know the answer to any of these questions, stop. You will get into trouble.

Literally shaking right now...

Great answer! Thanks!
Your method seems interesting. I thought about using Diceware to generate a random password. They are easier to remember while having enough entropy to be unbreakable.

I think most sites do not allow minors to trade coins. I strongly advise you not to register on shady sites, since they have a habit to fuck you over.
Is it possible to get your parents involved? It might work if you explain your desire to buy coins.
Anyways, good luck either way :)

Bitcoin is unpredictable. A definitive answer is not possible. A lot might go wrong, a lot might go right. If you've got money to spare, invest it in Bitcoin. If you got a family to feed and barely scrape by, walk away.

"I never asked you anything before."
Yeah, probably because you created a throwaway account to beg for money.
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:25:20
Both sides of the coin are mostly speculative. We simply do not know whether Bitcoin will succeed or fail in the long run. Most points against Bitcoin (i.e. why Bitcoin will fail) evolve around government regulation (governments imposing sanctions on companies selling Bitcoins) or breaking the underlying cryptographic assumptions of Bitcoin (quantum computing, breaking ECDSA). The arguments made by leading financial experts are highly subjective and often display a staggering amount of ignorance (both technical and of society) imho.

Do not sell. Store your wallet somewhere safe, forget about Bitcoin for five years, come back, be rich.

Sounds like a [Base64 encoding]( Try a Base64 decoder (offline please) and then check whether the output reveals some more information about the key. If anyone here wants to help by inspecting your key, decline.
