A mysql database that sync with the bitcoin network once in a while is nothing different than the US dollar.

That symbol is the only fun people of age had when being kids, before videogames.

3rd party Offchain that needs to be implemented everywhere that sync with the blockchain?
Ok, not mysql but just stated it to make a point.
When did we blindly start to trust aws with an offchain solution?

Well I did it, now set for life.

It will not work for many reasons, time will not repair LN.

I did but appearntly i was not allowed to do so.

Time will tell you.
But to give you some leap - how about:
1: Its a centralized solution, much like the banks we have today (only difference is they would settle with the bitcoin balance every now and then)
2: It requires trust, its supposed to work like a bit like the internet, by routing transactions between the major nodes and you rely on all these nodes being honest (and or not hacked) 
3: There are many more reasons. But just take 2, imagine it all works fine, public use it but suddenly - you have some problems, just like name routing servers already have today. Imagine you browse the internet and it goes slow or is you dont reach reddit for some minutes. 
Imagine the public sending their money and it fails for a large number or poeple, fails in such a way that they lose money. They will never use ln again, ever. 
If we just use bitcoin as a ”proofchecker” every now and then, and rely on simple human trust all other times, well we arent solving all the problems we could do with bitcoin as a utility.

Is that illuminated spiderweb under the bitcoin lambo car?

Whats hilarious is all those negative press appearing when price goes down, and all these positive ones when price goes up. 
1. Before: Its like the internet in 2000. Its solving the worlds economic problems, Building a sustainable future, its raining lambos, person bought a pizza for 10000 coins ”wow”. Growing and outperforming, goverment this is looking at interesting blockchaintech. 
2. Now: Its a bubble. Its a fraud, Its crashing, Is it a scam? Bitcoin the worlds largest pyramidscheme. Visa cards has 3 billion customers, here is their ceo speaking - he says bitcoin is no good.
3. Near future. Criminals are using bitcoin transfers.  Bitcoin is the reason why the central banks are having problems. Bitcoin is undermining the entire ecosystem. House/apartment value falling? Bitcoin is the problem. 
Banks lost trust - its because of bitcoin.
Soon we reach 3, then it goes back to 1, and then 2 again.

"I'm confident it's gonna recover soon."
So if it doesn't recover your not "Definitely holding" anymore? That doesn't sound so definite to me.
Sounds more like a gambler in a casino.

Here´s how i back it up.

We can clearly see, the beginning of the mother of all crashes coming now.

And your not a sad troll?  
"whats causing bitcoin to rise" someone asks, your saying dinosaurs.
You are just running around reddit calling people trolls.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:39:38
Not anytime soon. In 2-5 years it will.
