and the core devs dont work for blockstream, ehueheueh and DCG isn't populated with bankers ehuehue and the white paper Satoshi wrote doesnt describe P2P electronic cash. It describes a settle system for Central Banks ehuehueuheu
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:28:13
Have you any idea who owns DCG?

The guy is legit, I think there are haters because he made money as an early investor. He also thought MT Gox were solvent and stated as much due to assurances by Karples. That damaged him but again Im sure it was a legit mistake.
Read the White paper "Peer to Peer electronic CASH" cores vision is certainly not Satoshi's

In my view an alt coin is a new ledger, BTC is the old chain (ledger) until it forked. The fork increases block space and lowers transaction fees allowing more users to make on chain transactions.
With the legacy chain Bitcoin can no longer grow in terms of transactions because for some reason the block size has been artificially restricted in size to 1meg.
Without room for more transactions bitcoin has peaked in terms of users, if no new transactions are allowed there wont be any.
Forking is a way to let users/miners vote which is the better way forward. A fork is totally legitimate in this case.

Explain how using small blocks and waiting for the Lightning network has anything to do with central banking

[–]peptocurrency[S] 12 points 7 hours ago 
Sure, here you go: Digital Currency Group, owned by central bankers, owns Blockstream, the company responsible for development and operation of the Lightning Network, a sidechain which, once operational, stands to remove the power from miners and centralize transactions within Blockstream's control (i.e. Digital Currency Group's control. i.e. central banker control).
On top of this, BitGo, yet another company invested in and partly owned by the Digital Currency Group, offers "special security" to the operation of sidechains (i.e. Lightning Network) to prevent double spending (since Lightning Network would consequently be running transactions outside the blockchain).
TL;DR: Digital Currency Group (funded by MasterCard), owners of Blockstream and Bitgo, (the companies responsible for LN development and operation), is run by central bankers. It doesn't get much more clear than that.

Ohh boy this is a rabbit hole. I'll get you started, but you're going to have to keep digging.
Digital Currency Group owns Blockstream (go to "B" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: "Board Advisor"
"Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act."
 
4. Blythe Masters: "Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the International Advisory Board of Santander Group, and Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce."
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See "How it works"). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a "service" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to "suspend" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

Has anyone actually read the Satoshi White Paper?
If you have, worth reading again. If not worth reading :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:01:09
But there is no work from core to scale bitcoin, only to usurp it with their off chain alternative which settles in Bitcoin. Its ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:07:26
Blockchain doesnt work say the people who originally dismissed Bitcoin. The Bitcoin White Paper is very clear. Electronic peer to peer cash system.
Without trying how do you know it will fail? Just saying.

I thought I heard the argument from small blockers that bitcoin should be for Central banks to settle with. Not for small businesses?

I read somewhere recently that only about 0.1% of the population hold or have held Bitcoin.
I wondered what the stats were for gold or stocks, 90-95%?
Anyway to reach 51% of the population that figure of 0.1% needs to double 9 times.
I don't know, assuming the price reflects demand (ie users) can we expect a price 9x200%
If so $5,120,000

I watched a talk where Andreas likened the internet naysayers warning it couldnt scale to peter todd. Fail to scale I think it was called.
