Ahhhh, X is the factor. My X is $5k. If it drops that low then Im all in, however if it even starts to bounce from current prices by a grand I'll still buy a couple

im waiting to buy back in when it reaches "there's no fucking way it will ever drop to X"

Ver gave up his US citizenship and lives in Japan now. Considering Cryptos are stil unregulated and SEC is slow AF with new tech, the japan thing, tweets, collusion possible w Brian, this would be a shitshow for the SEC to put the whole thing together to charge him with anything.
By now, I'm sure evidence of collusion via emails, texts etc are either wiped clean, or they were using encrypted messaging systems to make it work.
