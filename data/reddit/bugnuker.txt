Thank you!
I've also created Groups. This will let you put contacts into groups, such as "tippers" or "content creators", "friends" and even "family" if you really wanted too ;)

We don't have everything finalized, but I don't see what would be different in EU vs US.
It's a digital currency, and the value is the same everywhere. We'll offer converters to charge what you want, but I don't think it would matter.
I like the debit card because it is simple technology, a mag stripe. Everyone has this. It can be accepted anywhere. We can also do Chip-N-Pin cards too, but I really need some investment before that happens.

Thanks!!!!! Fixing now!

The Coinleap system holds the PK's.
Like I said in the post, we are working on multi-sig and another options to give you the flexibility to store keys. 
For example, using SMS payments, you won't ever be able to store the key. The service will have to do everything for you. 
But you could have another "wallet" per say that is using the technique I described in the post about signing a transaction and letting Coinleap insert into the blockchain.
This is a deal breaker for many, I know. But I've tried to think of everything, and I can't offer half the services I am if I don't have a central system, somewhat. Using some other ideas I'm working on, there should be a real nice middle ground solution in the future.

My new service Coinleap does just this. If someone wants to send currency from your account, your mobile device gets an alert and you must approve it before it leaves your wallet. 
I'd like to build something to get a key from a hardware wallet in this step and sign the transaction on the device then send to block chain. This would allow holding your pk while still having the power of apis and things like a debit card. 
 
In this case, the app would be open source to ensure the pk is treated right while taking to the api.

lol for the sack of the community? oh god. what sized sack are we talking?
Ok, sorry.
PM me, I'll need your email and I can send some invites your way.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:01:58
True! But they still support it at a hardware level. They are required to ;)
It's a fall back method. I'm in the industry :P
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:20:36
Linking with visa and or MasterCard would incur crazy fees they have. 
I'm trying to change payments and get out of the visa model.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:20:12
I built this system to support a wide array of things. The OAUTH 2.0 API's give this type of ability: 
Developers can go crazy. Users have great security and some really neat features. Merchants have ability to accept payments multiple ways. The possibilities are endless (Cable guy quote.. lol) - this is just the start. Once we launch, and you get to see all the things put together, I think you'll see why. I'm always open for feedback as well. I will try to implement each and everything I can.
Change Addresses: It doesn't at this time. We are still young. Give us time to get some of these things working. It's a massive system and all of these things are possible.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:40:02
DAMN! Another one? 
Thanks for the heads up!!
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:05:44
Good to know. 
I'll follow this closely. I'd love to get the process started for my services.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:09:40
You know, I've never heard of this. I'll do some research and see what I can find. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:22:40
For users, no cost. Merchants pay the fee to accept. No more than 1% flat. 
I have the card printer already. I have everything ready for the debit card except polishing the merchant api and testing some phone features. Database tables and everything has been created. 
I'm afraid to launch it without someone funding this thing. Once that happens and I can get some legal advice, were ready to go.
The card connects to your Coinleap account. When you pay for something your phone will ask what currency. Then it sends it. On block chain too. 
All coinleap transactions can be on the block chain. I'll try to get some demos soon.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:10:43
I do agree with you. The logo process for Coinleap was a pain in the ass.
This is what I got and this is what I am using right now. We're already too deep in the branding to change it right this second, but I've always planned on changing it in the future.
I'm saving your post for future, thanks for the offer!
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:08:06
Maybe! I am a c# developer but I just haven't had the time for Windows Phone yet.
Right now, everyone one the team is pretty much a volunteer. I pay them what little I can out of my pocket. We're hoping for some real investors (not asking the community, going after real VC's) then we can pay real salary. 
It's your call. If you want to join up, let me know. We use slack for team chat and bitbucket for source control.
Thanks for the interest!!

No one forces you to use anything. I'm very happy with what I've built. This website is a nice theme. 
What about the API's? The OAuth 2.0 servers? The security features? Device notifications? Debit Card? SMS Payments? This is 10 months of work. But it is a pretty website. Thank you ;)
Again, no one is forcing you to use it. Look's like this one's not for you :(
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:50:13
I've had a few people review, but I agree fully. I'm doing all of this with my own money, my own time and I just don't have the resources right now to do everything 100%. I am more focuses on the code and the security.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:32:55
Coinleap is the OAUTH provider. We'll have samples for you to see soon.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:12:28
:) Trust me. I am ALL about security. 
Here: 
This is SPECIAL. Its per device. Did you see the post? I put the RFC link in the post! :) It's the same Spec Google uses. 
SECURITY FIRST! It's all there my friend. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:05:09
Awesome!! I'll invite you right away
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:31:11
When I release the app, the API's and everything else on Feb 8th, maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe not...
We have demo videos of the app in action on YouTube. I've tried to post things about the project, screenshots, videos, etc to be as up front and clear as possible. 
Time will tell I guess.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:27:15
I've been building this for a very long time. My first post in sure, but look around at my user history. I've posted around and given screenshots, etc. Checkout my stackoverflow account. Checkout my linked in account. I've given my full name. I'm not hiding anything. This is what I am good at. Payments. Software. Check me out. I'm legit head to toe ;)
My ToS even states to please use this like you would PayPal or something similar. You don't put your savings in there. Mine isn't. Even though it would probably be fine, it's not a good idea. I know this. I only move small amount and load my wallet with what I want to spend/send to friends, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:19:00
That's a screen grab of an oauth grant request
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:25:22
Because it's fun. Coinleap is supposed to be fun. 
We will be offering custom coin list settings and you can disable anything you don't wish to use/see

Better Security.
- Known methods: 
- New Methods like approving transactions on your device.
- Built by experts that do this for a living. (Payment Industry, security)
Powerful API's
- OAUTH 2.0 Support: 
- REST API's using OAUTH Bearer tokens: 
- Multi-Platform (Android and Web will release in 5 days. iOS is in development and SMS is coming soon)
- All of those features, every single one is available for multiple currencies and more can and will be added.
To name a few.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:37:31
This is good to hear. But I would like to turn "for all we know..." into a "Look at this certification for this centralized service - they store users PK's in a tamper proof HSM device with backups encrypted using multi-sig stored in cold storage." 
As far as smart cards, this also can work. I am investigating this right now for a use in debit cards.
But, how about the poor countries, they don't have a smart card reader, but just an SMS enabled phone. I am not sure we will ever have a solution for that, and in those cases, we might need centralized solution that we know is secured, certified, and using industry best practices, such as an HSM to safeguard keys.

That's awesome. I've used Fiverr a few times for small little tasks and it's been pretty great. Now I can pay in BTC!
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:28:26
Very interesting. 
I have to go through a PCI audit almost each year. SDLC process and everything down to the last detail must be logged.
I would be interested to know more about this, as well as how to start the process, etc. 
HOWEVER; Let's please not make this like PCI. PCI is not there to help people, really its not. They have security guidelines, and they are good, but they charge hundreds of thousands of dollars just to get certified. This money goes right to VISA and it supposed to pay for the fraud. However, they use less than 10% of that for fraud. (Yes, there is A LOT of fraud, but there are more fees and they cover it easily)
If this comes to past, I would hope this is a free or semi-free service (people do need to be paid for time sometimes) but lets not turn it into a huge organization that is just out to get more money and not in the peoples best interest.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:51:14
Wow. This really turned out to be a bummer. 
Here's the deal. I completely see why people are skeptical. I get it. 
My dream would be that someone/company that you guys trust, that you guys know - was running/owned this. Then I could just be creating innovative software and solutions that you can trust. That is what I do best; I create damn good software. I don't want to run a business. Really, I don't. I want to design solutions that blow peoples mind. 
I really put a lot of effort and heart into this project. Not to scam anyone. But to change the face of digital currency. To bring it to more people. To let it go, set it free and see where it can go. 
I've been in the payment industry for 10 years. I really think I have the experience and skills to be able to make a difference. I've seen whats out there. I know what can be done and I have that edge I think some digital currency developers are missing.
I'll still be launching in 5 days. I hope I can earn your trust.
