Coinbase shouldn't be used as a wallet, they batch transactions instead of sending them individually so you could wait hours to see a transaction go through. Contact bitpay about it, they can probably help you out.

If you can use a card to get BTC from circle (I only have a bank account linked so I don't know if this is an option) you can get a paypal card which pulls from your paypal balance and use that to fund it.

Really it's just because you're asking them to borrow a SUBSTANTIAL amount of money over a LONG period of time. They mostly want to ensure you didn't borrow that money to get the house because they want sole claim on the house if you default.

That's like saying the source of my USD is USD. That is not a valid answer. By sourced they mean they want PROOF of origin of the funds. This means that if you mined the BTC, they want proof of this. If you sold items for BTC, they want that proof.

You'll be hard pressed to find someone willing to Paypal with you. The reason for this is that it's too easy to do a chargeback with it.

It depends on how fast your want your coins and how you want to pay. Localbitcoins.com if you live in a somewhat populated area
bitcoin-otc on freenode if you can figure out irc, lots of people to trade with there instantly
If you can wait, coinbase
@_date: 2013-02-16 21:11:37
Good luck. Coinbase has been VERY bad recently about killing orders when prices fluctuate too much. (That may not be true, it just seems that way to me)

There are 3 companies in the ASIC field right now.
Avalon, BFL, and ASICMiner
Avalon has shipped 3 units so far (delays blamed on Chinese New Year, they should be out any day..... really....)
BFL has been taking pre-orders since you think they have and haven't shipped anything yet (they're days away from shipping, really.....)
ASICMiner actually HAS ASICs up and running already, they didn't sell them to the public though. They offered half of their company (400,000 shares total, 200,000 went up for sale) at a price of 0.1 btc each.
They will pay out dividends when they make enough (they're currently pulling in something like $16,000 a day based on current hash rates).
You can still get into the ASICMiner company by buying shares auctioned on bitcointalk.org, they're going for about .5 a share now.
TLDR; yeah, these are the same that were supposed to come out a long time ago.
@_date: 2013-08-18 00:47:43
Best guess is because their website is half assed and they focused much more development time on the mobile app.

I don't see a way to verify my account. Also, you charge to deposit USD into here...? And you only accept USD wire transfers and BTC as deposit methods.

That site is run by Glooboy in  so if you need an amount not available on his site you can just message him and he will help you out.

The absolute worst part of all of this (other than the fact that they're not just refunding this guys money) is that they posted private messages between the buyer and themselves.

I consider full price for amazon goods in BTC to be a transaction fee. You can regularly get amazon gift cards for 5-15% off in BTC and redeem those yourself.  Granted, this skips a step in the process... so that's nice I suppose.

You have to give your SSN to do anything with PayPal other than paying for something via CC. If you want to deposit or withdraw any money, you have to confirm your identity.

Works unless your're working for a national company and their checks are drawn on a bank either not around you or that you haven't heard of. If you're LUCKY the bank it's drawn on will not charge you to cash the check (since you don't have an account there).
You could also cash it at a check cashing place and get gouged there, or you could cash it at Walmart and get slightly less gouged there.
Poor people tax.

They don't escrow anything, they charge everyone once the project completes, take their cut, then give the rest to the campaign.

You can do them from mobile because it just involves sending some BTC from an address. Grab the blockchain.info app for your phone and it will be easy.
As with all gambling, you will lose in the end.

You don't tip them the remaining balance of the gyft card, you tip them the remaining balance of the card as though it were a gift card. At the end of the night it comes out as cash to them.
Imagine you have a physical $20 gift card for chilis and your bill comes to 16.20. You use the card to pay leaving a balance of 3.80 on the card. You don't give the server the card, you write 3.80 as the tip on your receipt and they type that in and the system charges the gift card the 3.80 extra as a tip for them.

It shouldnt be their job to police stupid people. Sure they should have a warning system saying are you really sure you want to dump at this price? If I want to sell below market that is my choice to make, not theirs.

I read a great post earlier saying that you should wait 3 months. With the death of Google reader it is going to open up a gap in the market and people will innovate to fill it. The "best" readers out right now won't be what's best in 3 months because of this.

except that bitcoin-otc and localbitcoins base their prices off of those exchange prices most of the time

Nah, at the time I posted that it was up $15 on btc-e, due to Gox 'closing' for today that statement is just garbage now. Though, I imagine when Gox returns and arbitrage starts up again, the price should settle around 150 over the next 2 days.

If you only check btc every couple days instead of watching it like a hawk, and today wasnt a day you checked it, it did nothing... example: look at price 3 days ago and now, its up $15!

Scroll down to the fixed rate ones. There are plenty of sites that will buy btc for USD via paypal, checks in mail, etc.

The thing about the cancellation of pre-orders doesn't mean all that much to them. From what I see, most people pre-ordered in bitcoin and they're refunding in USD value instead of the actual bitcoin amount.
They already made a shit ton of money, even if they have to refund a bunch.

Go to bank, ask bank for bank loan to start a bank... this is an interesting idea, I wonder how many banks would turn you down?

It fascinates me that people even use this service still.
I ordered BTC through them 28 days ago. It got delayed for 2 days (I needed the BTC same day to repay something) and I contacted them multiple times before they finally responded saying they couldn't do anything about it. My transaction was just stuck in their system.
In the end, they offered to refund the fee for my purchase once it settled. I contacted them again once it was complete with no response and my fee was never refunded.
Their lack of customer service is appalling.
EDIT: Perhaps their CS isn't as bad as I thought, they may just be backed up sometimes.

This is an interesting thought. How many people downloaded the app when they first heard about in the beginning, mined for 50 or 100 coins and just uninstalled the app because they didn't understand it or didn't think it would matter.
I'm sure the number is insignificant in the light of the 21m market cap.

I take it you've never worked as a server or known anyone that has. A server gets paid $2.13 an hour and lives off of the tips they take in each day. That 3.80 could be a gallon of gas or milk or a loaf of bread, much more useful to them than having a gift card for the place they work at.
