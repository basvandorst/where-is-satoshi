That's exactly what I thought I was doing at the time.
And then stored it all in my Dropbox.
In my Dropbox I have wallet wallet aes json files, blockchain identifiers, and eminder phrases. 
Today I have simply tried to import the wallet aes json files into Blockchain at whichpoint I see the 0 blance and transaction out.

Reminder phrase was stored in an encrypted file within my dropbox. Would be very surprised if anyone got access to that.

Nothing in there as far as I can tell :-(

Won't go into details but I can assure you that is not the case. If someone had got access I'd have been notified at the time.

No way they would have got into it within 2 days

About 0.5 coin. Not a great deal invested but a reasonable amount of money now.

Haha! If it's gone it's gone. It's more about just trying to understand if and where I screwed up. Still can't seem to suss that lol

I have the blockchain identifier, reminder phrases, and wallet aes json files. I was kinda of the impression of the time that this was now the wallet and it was no longer on Blockchain. If that's not the case then guess I screwed up at the time. If not how has a transaction taken place 2 days later?

I can see the transaction sending it to another wallet 2 days after my purchase.
This was where it went.
