To say that the price can't fall below 6k because that's what it costs to mine btc is naive and shows a lack of understanding. 
The cost to mine bitcoin depends on the hash rate and difficulty. If the hash rate difficulty increases ( which is often the case during bull markets as more people try to mine btc and overall mining profitability is high) the dollar/electricity costs of mining a btc increases.
In a bear run however as the btc price decreases the more ineffecient miners will eventually be forced out of business and the lower over all profitability means that the number of newer entrant willing to make the investments into mining Riga farms will be lower. All this to say that the overall difficult of mining a block will decrease ( via a difficulty adjustment which happens after every 2016 blocks or so have been mined ). 
The end result of this lower mining difficulty eventually would result in  lower overall mining costs. Thus while it may cost 6k to mine a btc today it could easily cost only 4k or 2k to mine a btc say 6 months down the line.

Nobody, you just have to take their word for it. Again this is where that oldage advice "Not your keys not your coins" comes from and for good reason

While your numbers are right I reckon that the price of gold today is very undervalued/ suppressed. Look the London billion market and you will find that their annual paper gold trading is worth about  $5-15 trillion dependinf on how you take into account overall netting of transactions.
When you look at this figure along with the overall gold market cap which is about $7-10 trillion the price supressikn starts becoming much more obvious.
Other important figures to consider is that that the London billion market trades nearly the entire gold produced in the world in an enitre year in about 150 tons in a span of just 4 days.
Gold to me is the most suppressed commodity and one of the most undervalued currencies in the world today.
A lot of parallels can be drawn between gold and brc especially when you consider what happened to the btc price once those futures exchages launched
