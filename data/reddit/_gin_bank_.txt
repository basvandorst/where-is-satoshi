I want to post an update, but I feel that posting only parts and examples of the message history of this trade is not enough. 
Either I can sum it up in my own words, or I have to think of the best way to make the entire message history public. 
I also noticed that the screens I uploaded at tinypic seem to be gone, I need to find a better image host as well. 
Also if reddit staff interfere with what I am posting I might be better off hosting this report myself or at least elsewhere. 
In shortest summary: 
At the moment the seller Gomerlin is asking localbitcoins.com staff to release my payment, so that I don't publish his name. 
Localbitcoins.com staff do not agree with me posting the sellers name here and they do not want to release my 13 BTC.

1.) The payments I sent were not late. A national bank transfer takes at least 1 business day. Both payments were received after 1 business day, at the same time, just as if it would have been sent in one single transfer. 
2.) The 90 minute time limit for marking the payment as complete does not affect the time the bank transfer takes to reach the sellers account. I marked the payment as complete within the 90 minutes window. The seller could not have had any reasonable expectation to receive the funds in his account within 90 minutes. 
3.) There was no option for abuse. As the buyer, once I marked the payment as complete, not making the complete payment is simply not an option! If the buyer would not make the complete payment, he would not receive the BTC obviously. He would also receive a bad review, or he would receive a banned account. So there is absolutely no option not to send the payment.

yes, I don't agree with this because the seller advertised his trade with the payment method "National bank transfer" so he could not have expected to receive the AUD amount within 90 minutes.  If he had wanted to complete the trade within 90 minutes, he would have needed to select a cash sale, or possibly a cash deposit, or at least a transfer with a specific bank, so that he could see the payment immediately. 
Localbitcoins allege that I somehow did not commit to paying for this trade, that I tried to "hedge" my risk, which is of course nonsense. At the moment I mark the payment as complete I have a duty to make sure the seller receives the full amount. 
The seller told them that he was unable to release the BTC due to me sending a partial payment, but this is not relevant because nobody including myself would have expected him to release the escrow within the 90 minute window, and not until he has received the full payment in his bank account, and I told him that as well. 
He also did not even receive the second payment late due to the timing, both transfers arrived the next busines day, so he had no delay. It would have even been normal if the transfers had arrived on the 2nd business day as it is a transfer between two different banks. 
I see no justification to have the BTC amount reduced.

That is right. I am female. When the seller started to accuse me of being a scammer, I offered to call him on the phone. I asked for his phone number several times so that he can rest assured that I am in fact female. He did not provide his number. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:35:24
chrisomint,  the payment was "National bank transfer" , not "Cash deposit"  - A bank transfer never arrives within 90 minutes, this was clear from the start. This was the payment method that the seller advertised for this particular trade. 
The complete payment has been in the sellers bank account the next business day, and has been sitting there since. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:17:30
Yes I paid on time. I was logged in to my online banking, I had filled up my account before doing the trade so that I have more than 8000.00 AUD available in it. (I can show this on the bank statement).  I entered the details of his bank account and the full amount, clicked submit. Then went to the localbitcoins screen, clicked to mark payment as complete (which is important to do quickly, otherwise he could cancel the trade and I have lost my payment).  Once I marked it complete and went back to my banking screen, I saw the error about the 5000.00 limit, called the bank, did the 5000.00 and went back to the localbitcoins screen to inform the seller that he will receive two payments. Then I saw he already tried to withdraw from the trade, telling me to cancel my bank transfer. Since I had already sent 5000.00 and had no way to cancel it, I explained it to him and uploaded ID and everything so that he can rest assured that everything is ok. 
The payments both arrived very well in time, next business day.  He advertised National bank transfer, this can take up to 3 business days. So my payments arrived quickly. 
He had no loss, no delay, no inconvenience at all. He was just looking for a reason to cancel.

Thank you. 
Are the two screens (before and after) still visible for you via the tinypic image host? Otherwise I have to host them elsewhere. 
I actually had to re-upload them to the image host. This is getting tiring, I probably should put the whole dialogue on pastebin, but it won't be screenshots, it would be pasted text. In the end someone alleges that I manipulated it ... 
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:21:59
There might be people in Germany, but I had the money in my account in Australia, so I had to use that. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:09:19
That would not have happened because of my transfer at all. My bank knew that my transfer to the seller was made by myself because I called my bank. 
If his account was blocked, then probably from another trade that was in fact fraudulent. And that is nothing caused by myself or by my transfer.

They have an escrow system, but they don't seem to have competent and mature enough staff to make proper judgements, or they are indeed biased towards sellers as another user suspected. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:42:40
The seller tried to cancel the trade, because shortly after BTC went up a lot, and he regretted having sold at that price. 
So cancelling the trade in itself would be unfair to me as the buyer. 
How can I describe it, a deal is a deal. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:11:50
He only started wishing to have the BTC released after I went public with the story. Before he kept insisting to send the money back and cancel the trade. 
His wish does not seem to have bothered anyone from localbitcoins to release the BTC, in case he can still release them, he also did not do it. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:30:50
Yes there has been updates, the seller begged me to clear his name and told localbitcoins staff to give me what I want, localbitcoins staff are still taking the side of the seller and refusing to release my 13 BTC!   I have many new messages.  
The entire message history is so long, I could not make screenshots of it all.  I cant even decide which parts to post because they are all equally ridiculous and important. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:11:30
He could not have thought this, because I advised him immediately, and I offered to call him and I sent him my ID, to make sure he has no doubts about this. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:16:38
What does that mean in practice, I am not too familiar with reddit. 
Can something be done about it?
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:28:45
I am glad there are still people with common sense in this world.

I think reddit are removing posts that contain personal details, so they might also remove links to them. I am not sure how to link to it without getting shadow banned again. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:14:25
lol yeah, I could imagine he offered BTC as payment :o

If the seller would have expected to receive funds within 90 minutes, he should not have selected "National bank transfer" as the payment method for this trade. 
Then he should have selected cash deposit or any other payment method that can be executed instantly. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:24:46
Yes his choice to publish his blood type and info on his blog, isn't it? Everybody can google his user name Gomerlin and see his blog first thing on google ... 
I will not risk being discredited and called paranoid, when I report that someone was at my house yesterday, so I find it legitimate to back up this claim even it is based somewhat on stereotypes. 
I have lived in South America for a year and know the mentality, I know about crime and kidnappings and dishonesty in general that has its roots in the very culture of the population. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:52:12
Between different banks? In Australia it takes 1 - 3 business days. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:56:10
It looks like reddit removed his name. I did not upload any "dox", just mentioned the name of the bank account holder that received my money. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:53:14
Until now the BTC amount was not corrected back to 13 BTC, neither was the BTC amount released from escrow to my account. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:41:34
in my original post you can see the screenshots of it!  It's unreal isn't it?
Thanks for the recommendation I will re-upload the images there asap. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:45:57
Unfortunately localbitcoins gave the seller the remaining ~12.7 back from escrow, stating that they would have long released them to me, had I not posted on reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:26:21
Update: 
As of now the BTC amount in escrow has not been restored to the original traded amount of 13 BTC. 
The escrow for the ~12.7 BTC has not been released to me either. 
As it doesn't seem that localbitcoins.com will resolve this, I will have no choice but to retain lawfirms in Finland, Germany and Australia tomorrow am if the BTC are not released by end of business today. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:45:16
The before and after images are on postimage.org now. They show how the escrow amount was actually changed. 
Thanks for recommending postimage.org its much faster and better. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:44:10
He was being edgy from the start, that is right, this is why I immediately uploaded ID to him, so he could stop assuming that I am a scammer. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:04:43
If anyone wants to see the complete message history from the very beginning (a lot), I have it on pastebin now. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:31:34
Like I wrote before, I have previously lived and worked in Australia for several years and I still have my bank account there. I wanted to use the AUD from my bank account to buy BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:35:06
The localbitcoins system has different options the seller can select. He can select bank transfers within a specific bank (that is what he would select if he wanted the transfer to show quickly). The seller could have also selected cash deposit at a specific bank for example. 
If a seller selects "National Bank Transfer" then he is well aware that this is a transfer between two different banks that takes at the very least 1 business day in Australia. 
Some sellers also make specific requests in writing in the trade details. The seller gomerlin did not make any such specific requests.

I had no expecation to receive the BTC within 10 minutes, within 90 minutes or even on the same day. 
It is common sense that the seller has to receive the bank transfer in his account first. 
However after receiving the bank transfer and checking my ID, he should have released the escrow. 
The sellers rating was positive 100% on a few trades but I overlooked that his account was only created about 2 weeks prior. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:28:47
Just posting facts and status. 
Could have been a possibility that the seller released the incomplete BTC anyway and then sends me the missing amount separately.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:24:26
I wasn't using reddit before - I was told reddit is a good medium to make this public when I told people on IRC about the case. I understand your scepticism. I have records of everything however and can back up everything I am writing.

When I am not logged into my reddit account, this message appears as deleted.  Since I have not deleted it myself, I assume a reddit admin did.
