Inflation is not the problem, it is the fact that banks can take loans at low interest rates to support projects that are unsustainable. Are you implying that banks truly thought the housing bubble would continue into perpetuity? If so this is just another reason not to trust bankers and their investment decisions.
Prudent investors would not take on such investments knowing that the risk was much to high for the returns.
The federal reserve should have raised interest rates to slow down the economy, yet the federal reserve cannot be expected to understand the entire micro/macro/international economy at all times, this is why we have price signals and static interest rates deforms this system.

Just because bitcoin prices fluctuate based on the news relating to acceptance is nothing new. In time one of 2 things will happen, the bitcoin network will become so large that the Chinese would be fools to deny bitcoin acceptance, the bitcoin marketplace will be so large that a single economy will not have as much influence on pricing, or bitcoin will become completely seperated from political entities and enforcement of bitcoin policy will be all but impossible in anything but the most totalitarian states. (Will the totalitarian states exist if they have to pay their troops in hyper-inflationary monopoly money vs. the universally accepted bitcoin?)
These are growing pains, and as the network becomes more distributed it has less influence from single entities.
Decentralization in this context means that if the Chinese government manages to raid and find every bitcoin node (ever the ones of the dark web), there is still nodes around the globe to manage bitcoin transactions for the Chinese living under duress.

Now with the modern internet, and now modern money we have the ability to move resources around instantly, where as in the 19th century we did things by wagon, train, and telegraph. We may still experience depressions from time to time, but the reorganziation of resources could happen alot quicker.

You need to understand the spin off technologies to understand how it benefits society. Many people did not see the benefit of the horseless carriage, the telegraph, flight or the space program but the benefits have certainly changed the standards of living. Asteroid mining can turn rare expensive minerals into common, cheap ones. What will we do with this new found prosperity? What if we could rebuild our entire society in carbon nanotubes? More efficient transports, structures, etc. If we could eliminate 1% of our energy needs what would this do for society? What if we could eliminate 10$ of our energy needs? You say Joe Schmoe does not benefit, I say he benefits the most. Rich people don't care about cheaper transport or more efficient structures, their lives are very excessive compared to average as it is. 
I remember reading somewhere that there was more foreclosed housing than homeless people so.....this is a market and regulation problem that can be solved today but I digress.
There are already companies that are pursuing asteroid mining, it could have happened sooner had the technology/investments been available.

Bitcoin has the potential to be unlike any other currency ever attempted by human kind. With a transaction velocity under 10 minutes bitcoin could potentially have very high velocity when needed (increasing 'inflation') to support growth, and also slowing down (close to zero growth?) to support savings. It is like a federal reserve without the greedy central bankers. What would signal the velocity to change.....don't know, there must be some invisible hand market force at play. (Perhaps it is tied to interest rates?)
The problem with economies in the past is that information and oppurtunities weren't always known, this could lead to mal-investment or even good-investment that just failed. Even if you did have complete information transmitting money is still a time consuming affair. With a new system of communication, the internet, and a new monetary system, the bitcoin, we can try to prevent those situations from happening.

One strategy to consider is dollar cost averaging. If you invest $500 a day over the next 40 days you will end up with an average over those 40 days. So if the price tanks today, and then rockets a week from now you are still getting a decent price over the long run. Long term we all expect Bitcoin to acquire a lot more value so short term noise is really of no consequence for HODLers.

When the party stopped the government froze up the lending, causing the depression. Same thing happened in 2008 but instead this time the government lent all the money required to keep banks afloat, businesses open.
Part of the problem could be attributed to communication. Communicating that you wanted to make a deposit, lend money, invest in a business was a very time intensive task back in the 1920's. Many most likely did not have even  a phone, possibly not a car either. Moving finance to facilitate business was difficult. Fast forward to today where I can send 5 billion dollars (unlimited really) across the globe in 10 minutes. The fact that we can move resources quickly will help to even out the ebb and flow of the world's economy.

Why couldn't the bank pay you interest? The bank becomes a lender who people are comfortable borrowing from, they charge your rate + some percentage rate for their services. The bank is also someone you trust to hold and lend your money. The bank could issue Certificates of Deposit so they are not worried about bank runs.

Some people will write a check at the cash register because that is what they feel is comfortable, regardless of time usage. Most people use a faster method of swiping a debit card. Sure time will not matter to some people, but for most the speed will matter. As a merchant I would rather have my money in 10 minutes as opposed to some fraction of a day later. We could be splitting hairs here, but I love being able to get my money on my person in minutes.


Middle men is a recent phenomenon, for thousands of years people transacted person to person via the currency of their choice. There will be alternatives available with the profits going to innovative and forward thinking businesses, not businesses that wish to keep their profit model intact.


In any business model where you pay merchant fees you either absorb that cost by increasing the price of the item for sale (eating the cost) or pass on the cost to the customer via fees (illegal in many places). Either way the transaction is more expensive. If the average person who spends $50,000 a year can save 1% to 3% that is $500 - $1500, not a small amount for most people.


More importantly you will not threaten a person's monetary policy. Policing Bitcoin would be prohibitively expensive, and prosecution of "illegal bitcoin" transactions would also difficult. Some courts have decided that just having an IP address is not enough to tie a person to a crime. How can you prove that the software at that address has not been hacked to provide a proxy? Like I said, banning is a possibility, but the frictionless nature of bitcoin will allow any economy using it to prosper above what is possible with the traditional banking system. With many major merchants doing millions of dollars in business via bitcoin it may be too late to stop bitcoin.


If a computer can run the VISA network, a computer can run the bitcoin network. We also have Moore's Law, Kryder's Law, and Nielsen's Law. Once we get this monkey off our back called, "The Great Recession", we will see another golden age.

There are more reliable markets forming every day. (Coinbase, Circle??, Bitpay, Second Market, etc.) I am sure the Winklevoss twins will also either insure their holdings, or self insure (as they are large holders and only intend to put 50K bitcoins on the market). This MUST be part of an SEC review, as the SEC usually has some pretty stringent requirements. The advantage for investors is that they get to hold bitcoin, trade bitcoin. The advantage for the ETF is they get to arbitrage the holdings. Buy cheap coins on the internet markets, sell expensive coins on the NASDAQ. Eventually both prices will approach zero difference and the price that large investment markets are will to pay is what everyone will value BTC at.

There is nothing wrong with taking on debt, but when you are using the productive capacity of society for enterprise that is not profitable (because you can borrow money at no future cost) then this creates mal-investment. Instead of money being invested in asteroid mining which promises to drasitcally reduce the cost of platinum, creating an environment for cheap carbon nanotubes, which means space elevators, yet we are taking money to build homes for people that can't pay for them. Which enterprise will raise the standard of living greater?
**The world needs free floating interest rates to determine what business is profitable, and what is not.**

I read a study that said if you controlled 2% of the network you would have a 12% chance of successfully double spending. You basically would have to transmit the real transaction and the counterfeit transactions simulatenously and hope that the counterfeit transaction would be the accepted transaction. That being said controlling 2% of the network costs about $750,000, so to control that much just to double spend a meal at the restaurant is ludicrous. I also have not heard of anyone losing to a double spend.

I have been talking with some Venezuelans over the net and it appears they have some fundamental issues relating to government control and crime in their country. Using the bitcoin around the country is illegal, and sure to attract the attention of the government or other criminals. There is no method of easily converting the Bolivar into bitcoin, again because of the government or other criminals. I have spoken with Colombians who state it is possible to convert Bolivar to Colombian money, but how will you get large sums of money across the border? The government is very repressive and controlling of the economy, yes bitcoin can help though it appears to be slow going.
I do like the idea, and I have followed up with u/rdymac. I have also found some people IN Venezuela who deal in bitcoin. Imagine the possibilities when you consider we can send large quantities of BTC directly into a country to acquire goods, get projects done. This is a very unique capability that BTC has. Let me know if you come up with some concrete ideas, proving bitcoin can help overthrow a corrupt government would prove to the world the era of decentralized currency has arrived.

I posted in the other thread how content creators will need to 'sign' their wallet. 
I already commented on iShit (don't subscribe to walled gardens), I already have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus. The problem with those systems is that the aggregators of that content need to negotiate with production houses or whoever owns the content so some content comes and goes and all of it isn't available. With the internet being a network of a billion people if .1% of them are film makers that means there is ~1 million film makers in the world, how could Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, or ANYONE possible review all of their works?
How about we use the crowd source method and I can pay people for works I enjoy. Also if the film garners attention from a measly 50,000 internet users each donating 1 USD, the film maker will have made an average US salary. Media distribution companies probably won't touch material unless it will have revenue in the millions.
There was a time when we didn't need horseless carriages, flying machines, or even a network of computing machines, yet each of these inventions is revolutionary. Bitcoin continues the trend.

To be honest I am mostly interested in the ability to prevent depressions. It would seem that depressions caused in the 19th and 20th centuries could have been caused by the 'lack' of velocity of money. Transferring money could possibly take days? (or was there a system of transmitting money via telegraph??) When liquidity dried up, businesses went under, employees had to rely on savings or sell their assets, and the whole cycle would begin again with a boom from the result new found wealth of cheap assets/businesses. Now when a request for liquidity comes about, if the business has the books to afford the capital and it's interest the business can resume and we avoid the bankruptcy. If the business fails completely, hopefully the investment was spread amongst many...
I would like to think that bitcoin and decentralized/distributed banking can replace the 'safe guard' the federal reserve is supposed to be.

If the company has no other debt and no other assets then the company should be worth 100,000 bitcoins * currency selling price / # of shares outstanding. The market will also tend to price in a future value so it is possible stock shares will cost more, no one knows how much more though. 
The company probably has employees and other expenses, hopefully they have revenue, most likely other assets and liabilities. So you will need to factor these into your calcuation of a fair price.

People in Kenya are already using electronic money via 'M-PESA' but what happens when the oligarchy decides this is detrimental to their power structure?? Bitcoin isn't susceptible to oversight and regulation.....
People in the third world don't always want to transact with Wal-Mart, sometimes sending money home without exorbitant fees is reason enough to use one currency over another. I wish most places would accept bitcoin, it is just as convenient as a credit card and the fact that I am not susceptible to the consequences of our current financial system are incentive enough to NOT use fiat currencies....

Bitcoin is similar to the Internet, a decentralized network that is not controlled by anyone in particular. You can cut someones access here, but they can rehook up over there. Bitcoin is similar, and because it is recognized as currency with many desirable properties it is transacted widely on the Internet. Bitcoin makes Internet commerce faster, safer, and cheaper than all other solutions, these facts alone will displace other forms of Internet money. Since the Internet has become the de facto standard of communication, Bitcoin will become the de facto standard of Financial communication.
I have seen this type of negativity towards technology in the past, back when the Internet was in it's infancy people thought the notion of a computer connected network for communication was absurd, and it probably was for most people. Today people cannot live without email and sms, voip makes worldwide calling cheap.

Sure there is regulations and laws to protect my assets, but why should this be any different for bitcoin. As a society we choose to make rules against thieves and fraudsters. The bitcoin world this does not need to be different and thieves and fraudsters need to be held accountable. I don't believe a centralized currency where interest rates are manipulated is the correct way to steer investment, nor do I think a guaranteed backstop should be provided to fractional reserve banks. Asset banks should be insured (such as bullion depositories, museums, etc.), exchanges should be insured and audited for security best practices to a globally recognized standard (similar to other financial standards). There is no need for burdensome government regulation.


Government bodies have done a horrendous job at legislating financial risks. (Worldcom, Enron, Lehman Brothers, to name a few of the recent ones) The Great Depression didn't happen until after finance was governmentally legislated, the tech and housing bubble was primarily a function is cheap lending and a lack of risk management. You are right, there is no black or white. But the marketplace is where you find the grey, when you function in a realm of monopoly money (government currencies where the bank can get more) you have trouble valuing assets correctly.You are right that too much regulation stifles innovation and growth. If the US government didn't have so many rules regarding finance we would see a major push towards digitalized currencies and thousands of new tech jobs as we convert old monetary systems to new ones.
Greed is not a bad thing. Greed has helped to propel society to the state we know it today. We live in a world where poor people are FAT, it is tragic, but it is far from the standard that the third world poor must deal with. Bitcoin will gain mass acceptance in time, just as the first cars were hard to drive, first computers impossible to use, first DVR (VHS VCR) couldn't be programmed easily, technology has only 1 way to go, and that ist o make it easier. Developers don't always want to improve the network because they are already rich don't need anymore money, most developers want to be the next billion dollar startup (I would have said million, but a million dollars isn't cool according to Sean Parker) **Greed is what will help bitcoin grow.**

Bitcoin is for deregulation that is fair, all the participants are aware of all the information that everyone else is aware of. 
Bank policy in the short term has been about flooding the markets with currency in the hope that it will spur economic development. In some cases the banks have taken money from depositors, and now the Eurozone is running negative interest rates. If it were not for bank deregulation, allowing banks to loan money to anyone and everyone, pass on those loans to unsuspecting investors while taking a cut and throwing lavish parties, we would not be in this state of over investment in real estate. With bitcoin, we will have a fair an open marketplace that will value according to market forces, not deregulated banks trying to make more for themselves.
TL;DR Most bitcoiners are for fair deregulation, the type of deregulation that happens behind closed doors is more akin to price fixing and collusion for fraudulent purposes, not improving the lives of Earth's societies. (soon to be society)

Even if intra-bank transfers were free just being able to complete a large transaction in an hour vs 3 days is a bonus. I control everything soup to nuts, no middle man.
If merchants provide a discount for BTC then it is a huge incentive. Protections add to fees, I am not a scammer nor is the business I am buying from then I'll gladly keep the 3%. Protections are good for questionable merchants, services will arise for this purpose.


There is a cost for services because individuals do not understand how to do it themselves, but there is no reason you cannot just send BTC from wallet A to wallet B. ($.06 transaction fee, beat that??) Expect services to approach this price as economies of scale grow.


All the regulation in the world cannot stop bitcoin, you will essentially have to start kicking down doors and taking peoples computers away from them before you can stop bitcoin. Anywhere you try to stop bitcoin you will face economic difficulties (in comparison to other countries) as other nations prosper from enhanced marketplaces. Money laudering and terrorism are just buzz worlds used for control and complacency, major banks are happily complicit in the current money laundering schemes and they are still standing so.....???


Micro-transactions will scale (software/hardware upgrades). Right now it has to happen off chain because of hardcoded limits (i believe), but eventually it will happen. Right now if I try to send $1 I will probablly face like 10-20% in fees vs 5% in BTC. Theoretically I could send $100 to some country where people live of $1 a day and give someone the ability to live for 3 months, all at $0.05.

- If a better currency comes along bitcoin will integrate new features or everyone will move to another currency. To recode and redistribute all the knowledge about bitcoin is no small task, and with all the investment in bitcoin it won't just happen over night. There is momentum behind bitcoin.
- The internet is still too complex for grandma and uncle joe, no worries they can continue to support their USD obsession and get ripped off at every turn (this happens anyway...no?) Bitcoin doesn't need 100% penetration, 1% is enough, 20% worldwide is a game changer. There isn't really an instance where you need change in bitcoin, but qr codes can generate the correct amount of tender.....
- There is very little safeguards from someone busting down your door and stealing your mattress stuffed with USD. Competant gun owners have a fighting chance, but how many do you know? Bitcoin banks will hold currency and secure transactions for you, all insured by a third party (not your tax dollars). The law doesn't care about you now, mostly just protection of the state.

For more info, the private key on the device is not encrypted but only accessible to the app or via adb if rooted (which you are). &lt;- In theory, someone may have found a 0-Day to circumvent this system..  Mycelium backup wallets are made via pdf with a decryption password avaiable only on screen during generation only (this must be written down). This provides 70 bits of entropy so cracking is unlikely. 
MEGA claims to encrypt data before transport to their servers.
How is your fedora system setup? Network? Could someone SSH into your fedora system, adb into your phone and steal the private key?
The MEGA route seems less suspect since they would need your password for MEGA (or some way to come in through a back door, but the data should still be encrypted via your cloud client), then crack the 70 bits of entropy on the backup unless you did something silly and stored the password for the backup online.
P.S. I would never store private keys in the cloud, do N of M multisig (Shamirs Secret Keys) and distribute among friends/family, etc.

Bottom line, don't support Apple products, don't suggest that friends or family buy them, and take every oppurtunity to explain how their products are inferior.

In the tech world Bitcoin is the new hotness, just getting started and attracting alot of money. It is either Bitcoin, or Candy Crush, who do you think will be more successful in the long run?
As for the regulation, let it be clear that any stifling regulation will only hurt the American economy. Bitcoin is latched to the internet, a global network, and any regulation that is not in the favor of the users will be bypassed in other countries or on the dark net. (Most exchanges are found outside the US because of draconian American law that prevents new markets from forming) 
Come to think of it, I don't think the American legal system can adapt fast enough to keep up with bitcoin, it will be interesting to see what happens if fiat value goes down the toilet and digital currencies become a primary method of exchange.

If you look at the velocity of money you will see that it is dropping like a rock. Considering that velocity is a component of inflation that would be the reason. People are not spending because they are losing jobs, trying to save money to feed their families while the government continues to feed the large banks hoping their loans will increase spending. Billions in wealth wiped out by malinvestment in overpriced assets (housing) in America and abroad. 
As billions was invested in housing during the mid 2000s the interest rates on money should have skyrockted, slowing down investment in housing and moving more people towards savings (look at those interest rates!). As everyone starts to save and loans become cheap again, ok, lets start some new businesses. The economy always has been, always will be an ebb and flow of growth and decay. Try to move with only a growth strategy does not flush out unproductive enterprise/investment.

The people with boat loads of money and influence are not interested in changing their business model that has made them millions (or billions) in the past. I understand your argument but in practice corporations have not been quick to change business models to be inline with the latest open source technologies. 
Napster was once a free (not sure if open source) program, once it was bought it subsequently died (at least for the tech savvy community)
Microsoft has had the lead on OS's for quite some time, their software is very controversial and continues to lose membership. 
Just about every content distribution network (Netflix, HBO, etc. etc) could benefit by using the ubiquitous technology that is bit torrent, yet no one has implemented anything for their system.

The conventional view of deflation is that if it sets in, “the banking industry, the financial markets, and much of the rest of the economy will be wiped out in a bottomless deflationary spiral.” But as Hülsmann goes on to argue, such a spiral would not prove fatal to the lives and welfare of the general population. Rather, it would destroy “essentially those companies and industries that live a parasitical existence at the expense of the rest of the economy, and which owe their existence to our present money system.”
Let us be more explicit. Severe deflation threatens at an existential level bankrupt banks and the bankrupt governments that perpetuate their existence. Deflation is a mortal enemy to the heavily indebted state and its embedded parasites, but it is a friend to the saver and to anyone with a positive net worth. Because it is so dangerous to the debtor, (unelected) central bankers clearly feel they have no option but to incinerate savers at the altar of perpetuating an unsustainably indebted banking and political elite.

Yes, and no. As bitcoin becomes more popular I see it as a hedge against the constant devaluation of fiat currencies. For the tech literate this means they can move into bitcoin and avoid the government interference. The rest of the world is effectively stuck with fiat, and as demand for the USD decreases so will the problems associated with servicing debt, acquiring new debt, and a decline in acceptance. For now the sheer momentum of the world economy based on the USD means it isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

This will happen in time, right now you cannot buy commodities, energy, food, resources with bitcoin in markets and that makes the value of bitcoin fluctuate. Once economists can apply their models and high frequency trading to a large subset of markets and commodities the value of bitcoin will stabilize.

Alot of this theory comes from a time way before we had computers that could send money across the globe instantly.
If bitcoin were to stop inflating now (it's growth phase) it should theoretically appreciate at 1.2% per year (population growth rate of the Earth). The global GDP growth is around (3% - 4%), so if you want to hold your cash and lose your 1.8%, your issue not mine. Granted this growth rate is with shitty manipulation and regulation. If we had truely free global markets I would add a 1% or 2%. So now as a lender I have choices, hold cash and get 1.2% per annum, invest elsewhere and potentially get more (or less), or lend if it is attractive. Most lenders charge high rates for a reason, not everyone pays back their loan.

Inflating the value of bitcoin helps to make mining, and transaction processing, more lucrative. This attracts more hashing power which makes the network more secure. As the price of bitcoin increases it becomes more and more legitimate as an instrument for buying. As more people own bitcoin the demand for the same supply increases, price increases.
Greed is not always a bad thing, maybe liberatarians believe the self-interest and 'greed' helps to solve alot of the worlds issues. I know it sounds counter-intuitive but you will find alot of subjects in economics that behave in such a manner. The movie Freakonomics (you can find it on Netflix) starts to explore some of these economic concepts.
Now, as an early investor in a technology do you think you deserve the be reimbursed? Think of the people that decided to spend them $100 on a night out drinking with friends instead of investing in Intel. Whose investment has changed the world as we knew it? Whatever was invested back then has come back thousands of times, and for more than just the original investor.

Hard to tell, hard to prove. I could reference transaction data, then overlay price data and find some sort of correlation. However would the increase in transactions be due to wealth effect (eg: I have a bunch more money now, lets spend it!) or is the increase in price from more transactions (eg: It is Christmas, time to spend). Economics is hardly a science, you can correlate data and come to conclusions, but since there is so many facets to an economy the next time you see the same data correlation you could end up with completely different conclusions. 
My example was merely an illustration on how Bitcoin will have some sort of minimum value, though this will probably never be reflected in the actual price because of other factors (hoarding, unknown amount of lost coins, daily transaction amounts, etc.)
I think that very few are using bitcoin as a pure transactional network. While it could be done and Circle is working on a model for such a thing, I am under the impression that most users of bitcoins already own them so they do not need to shop the open market to buy BTC to buy whatever it is they want.

Security, as of now it is a bit difficult for people to securely store and use their bitcoins. As we have seen in the cases of Mt.Gox and flexcoin, there are some pretty sneaky hackers out there looking for easy pickens. Most people are easy pickens. Most nerds are pretty safe and know how to use cold storage, but I know plenty of people with horrendous password/security discipine. 
With time and investment there will be enhancements to help deal with the security issues. For example maybe a service that works off the block chain with ultra secure storage of your bitcoin and provides processing linked to a creditcard sized piece of equipment could be a solution. It may not be ideal for all use cases, but there are plenty of people that need to be lead in the right direction.

For determining credit worthiness you could simply register a wallet with an identity and use existing lines of credit (Transunion, Experian, Equifax) to verify credit worthiness. This is far from ideal however if you really want lines of credit now, this could be a solution. Contracts requiring repayment may or may not stand up in court so the legality of loaning bitcoin is in question (first government to make this happens wins...Singapore??). In the future we could develop some sort of distributed credit worthiness system that would follow a wallet. Why cannot we use existing models to mitigate fraud. Just because I use bitcoin doesn't mean I don't want to show my face in front of potential loan investors.....?? With that said we could have another decentralized system that would work similar to bitcoin however be debt based to allow for 'credit card' use, address given by the loan investors and the same rules of any other currency system would apply. Bitcoin works as a debit card now does it not? Without a government entity how would we require repayment? I am not sure but I hope to start the conversation and see what ideas we could come up with.

It doesn't exist, only in a Keynesian economy where the whole system is corrupt. If interest rates are low that means there is a glut of money and labor built up ready for investment (pre boom), as that money goes to work (build buildings, new enterprise, new jobs) I would expect interest rates to rise slowing down growth. Some companies go bust, assets are sold at a great value, money movement slows as companies do not want to take loans at high interest rates, high interest rates attract more savings, and the cycle repeats. Interest rates are very important, but there is no reason for them to ever go below zero except in economic fantasy land.
Everyone has incentive to use their currency, only idiots (bitcoiners?) just store it under the mattress. You could put it into the economy and earn divideds/interest or you could buy new iShit.
With corporations hoarding large cash reserves and people saving it is almost as if the Keynesian economy has proven that it is just as prone to velocity driven deflation as any other economic system.

The hardest part of the equation is how do you convert bolivars into bitcoin. Here in America I can use online services that will take USD from my bank account and give me bitcoin, or I can meet people in my community that will exchange USD for bitcoin. I suspect that if you could use coinbase.com that would be easy, however I doubt that is an option. People may not be interested in money changing on the street as this is potentially dangerous. I have talked with some Colombians who claim they can change Venezuelan money into Colombia money, if this is the case you may be able to take Venezuelan money out of the country, convert to Colombian, and then wire it back to the States for anyone sending bitcoin. Another option is if the people of the world choose to donate bitcoin to assist with your countries ills. If 1 million people each send $1 USD I can imagine this amount of money would do alot to help acquire basic goods, toilet paper, food, etc. Although these items would probably have to be acquired on the black market since I don't know if shops will accept bitcoin or not.
How does this help your family? Well you acn start to move wealth into an easily transportable form of wealth. You can theoretically put $1,000,000 USD into a bitcoin wallet (or more) and then cross the border with nothing but your clothes on your back and still have access to that $1,000,000 USD. You can keep the private key (access code) to your wallet somewhere discrete so gov forces cannot get to your money (unless they torture you or something, in which case maybe have 2 wallets so you can give one and hide one). 
Venezuela will have to support this and figure this out alot on their own. The only thing I know is that with bitcoin, we can basically air drop as much stable (relatively compared to Bolivar) currency as we like right into the middle of your country. When the bolivar is delegitimized as a currency and the value plummets, the government won't be able to pay their enforcers anymore and you can retake your country.

I think the problem with alt-coins at this point is that we haven't figured out the exact problems with bitcoin.

I don't think so, paper money is a means of exploiting the working classes' productivity through inflation. Every year workers become more productive as they become better at their jobs, technology increases productivity, abundance of resources creates economies of scale. Yet all these gains in productivity are offset by a decrease in spending power (inflation).
When the shit hits the fan (SHTF?) paper money can fluctuate wildly as people attempt to buy real goods with hypothetical assets. Reference Germany circa 1919-1923.

Actually bitcoin can work in many situatons. Because storing wallets can be discrete, there is more plausible deniability vs having a stack of alternate currency in your home, on your person, etc. Sure any stable currency can work, but with bitcoin the world can send you money, RIGHT NOW, to help support your efforts. Maybe we start with some people on the border who can start to smuggle various goods that would be beneficial to independence across the border. As the goods and bitcoins make their way across the country it could possibly delegitimize any national currency, reducing the 'thugs' power to buy, power to be controlled by their masters. You make it sound like the people are more populous than the thugs, if so you should easily be able to overthrow them if you don't rely on them. You may still need bolivars for somethings, but better things can be bought with BTC. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS THAT THE WORLD CAN SEND YOU RESOURCES TO HELP YOU, JUST LET US KNOW HOW.

Just using bitcoin is revolutionary.
As people start to use bitcoin, the currency of the government becomes weaker since any amount of inflation they use to pay themselves (corrupt aka ALL politicians, bankers, regulators, enforcers) with only inflate more. The productive wing of society is protected from inflation by using bitcoin, the unproductive wing of society has to do something productive to get the bitcoins (or beg for taxes), which they don't. This in turn will cause illegitimate government to collapse and people can pay for institutions they believe in. (Ala, want to help the poor? Put your money where you mouth is)

In the US the current markets deal in USD, we are A LONG way from changing anything there.
Around the world economies can benefit from having their own exchange(s) for commodity trading. Utilizing bitcoin and other low cost solutions commodity markets could spring up for farm products (and other products though I think most people on the planet are farmers now) from around the world. For example perhaps South American farmers that do not want to operate within the confines of the industrial goliaths could branch off and start to trade forward/futures contracts derisking their farming output and allowing for steady growth. With the power of technology the markets could be radically different from the traditional commodity markets. Perhaps we could see hundreds of varieties of coffee from a host of different growers all being bid on. The power of the computing really gives us alot of options in this regard. Now take these commodity markets, decentralized (but not p2p, unless we brainstorm alot), and global. Maybe there would be 2-3 exchanges per country with different features. They could provide API's to allow for a world market place to emerge, and then we let the traders/importers/exporters/other businessmen bring prosperity across the globe, the whole system run on top of bitcoin as the underlying trading currency. (Oh, and we get awesome stability once we start to price neccesity on top of bitcoin)

The problem, the US has spend the past 14 years trying to recover from the dot com bubble and ensuing financial crisis. In order to recover the federal reserve helped to disperse large amounts of money in the form of loans, which the banking sector helped to use that money to build up the housing market, and resell those mortgages for a profit. As compenstation the banking sector was rewarded with large salaries and bonuses. Now building houses is normally a good thing as people need a place to live, but when you are selling a bunch of houses to people that cannot afford them, and doing this for years we have a mal-investment situation. You could say this happened because money was easy to get thanks to the federal reserve, and the hundreds of years of previous regulation could do nothing to stop it (this is a recurring theme with government and finance). 
Enter bitcoin. Bitcoin is not controlled by any central entity, so we cannot just print more bitcoin. If you want my bitcoin you will have to provide a good or service that I deem worthy of my labors (after all that is how I came across my bitcoin). The point being that with a limited amount of transactional currency, we will not be frivolously wasting it. More bitcoin will goto investments that will have real returns (such as new bridges, new factories, new technologies) vs. building a bunch of houses to pay ourselves bonuses. As the economy grows this builds wealth for the entire populous, thus making the world a better place. 
And that just scratches the surface, you can look into the corruption of governments (lots of governments, not just US) and their fiat currencies and find dozens of atrocities at their hands. Without fiat currency, government cannot just randomly start wars because someone ACTUALLY has to foot the bill, no more of this goto war, get the oil, and sink the cost of the war into federal reserve notes which just dilutes the value of the money you and I hold and denominate 'things' in.
tldr; Bitcoin is more equitable than the current system.

It most likely won't matter, the problem is that a business that makes millions selling services to pay a fraction of those millions to a large employ base is difficult to change. You also have investors who have a vested interest in keeping their profits high (dividend/stockprices/company value). What do you do? Do you change your business model using a much cheaper transaction system, start to run unprofitable, fire employees, and piss off investors? There is a lot of momentum behind Paypal, and I would be surprised if they are one day a champion of Bitcoin. Kodak had digital cameras, they could never turn their business around though.

Bitcon, like all assets is based on supply and demand. Very few people are using bitcoin now. Lets say that 1% of the entire bitcoin community is on reddit. That means we are a market of 10 million people out of a world of 7 billion. (700x) This does not include the fact that as more merchants accept bitcoin the velocity of the currency will increase as money is moving across the globe like we cannot even imagine. These factors will tend to increase the value of a bitcoin, the whole network, everything.
Think about the velocity of bitcoin for a second. As it stands now we are paid weekly, biweekly, maybe monthly. Bills are paid monthly. Imagine a world where we could pay everyhing by the day, prices on everything could be exact down to a level that gives the producer the bare minimum needed to profit and pay his employees. I am thinking this is some sort of ultra efficient economy where money and productivity is constantly moving trying to find the most profitable home. Just like information spreading through the internets instantly the new world economy will be financing ideas and the future like we could only imagine (has anyone written a sci-fi book on this yet?)

Yea, most people won't get into mining unless you have ALOT of money, a very cheap power source (I hear in the Pacific Northwest energy is cheap from hydroelectric dams), and you have a lot of knowledge of cryptocurrency (maybe this is optional but I would want to know every detail of a system I invest in). 
Buying the currency is a way of investing, since you are effectively taking a portion of the liquid currency off the market and remaining participants will need to compete for the remaining portion. Less supply, more demand, higher prices.
Buy your bitcoins at coinbase.com, they are a US based company and I trust them with my personal information. Mycelium is an easy to use wallet that will make your purchases portable and easy (scanning QR codes is my preferred way of transacting). For your computer based wallet I recommend Electrum or Armory, get familiar with how wallets and address work. Watch your transactions flowing through the network via blockchain.info. Learn about paper wallets and offline storage. There is many facets to this technology, but this forum is a great resource.

If everyone started using bitcoin, it would destory the Bolivar as we know it. The Bolivar is what keeps the Venezuelan government in control, without it they cannot pay their police/soldiers to intimiate the rest of the population. The less you use the Bolivar, the more worthless it becomes. Sure your country will be worse off in the short term, but in the long term I imagine great things could happen. Imagine how prosperous your country would be if the oil reserves of Venezuela were available to the entire world via bitcoin markets!

Regulation in the bitcoin markets will be an interesting endeavor. You want regulation so that people are not defrauded, and fraudulent actors are put in jail. If anyone says it is because of money laundering I am going to call bullshit, because I can think of a dozen ways to launder money right off the cuff.....and I don't think FinCen or anyone else could find it/prove it otherwise.
Now, if one entity starts to regulate bitcoin markets to harshly (we need these documents from you, there is this much overhead and tax, etc. etc.) then there is nothing stopping people from moving to another market, in another jurisdiction. This will have the effect of money trying to find the safest AND most profitable places. I am for regulation, but I think free markets can possibly regulate themselves better.

We started a discussion here.

I would like to learn more about the economics of bitcoin mining in Venezuela. I can definately see the advantages of using bitcoin in Venezuela, a worldwide currency that is not at the whim of local government, transaction secured by a decentralized network, the ability to secure savings and wealth in a very hard and almost impossible to find manner. What we need is for the community to embrase bitcoin, figure out how to use it, and spread the knowledge. In America I have found that using an Google App called Mycelium is the easiest method of using bitcoin. Are android phones common in Venezuela? How about internet access? What are some schemes we could think of to get value out of the country in exchange for bitcoin in? We could just work on a donor model for people interested in helping the Venezuelan, and we know the btc community is pretty generous.
