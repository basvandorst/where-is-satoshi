ETF, let's not all bank on a positive outcome. 
Just like in stocks, you don't want to have all your money on a binary outcome. But as you rightly mention, should a positive outcome develop....to the mooooooonnn!

Funny you mention that, exact same thoughts I was having when I noticed this comment.
Not that I've had much time to polish my thoughts on this subject, so here's my raw version: As the movement of bitcoins is now being restricted to exist  on exchanges only (at least for the time being on some exchanges) then the velocity of bitcoin will become restricted whilst the demand increases. Just being conspiratorial now: what if China sees the potential of a bitcoin USA ETF as an opportunity for Bitcoins (should it get approved). Why would you want to get your bitcoins out of the country when it would be a Trump style HUGE hedge on the Yuan. Whilst retaining capital on shore, those very same people wanting to get out of the Yuan because of the deflationary issues would just dump cash on bitcoin exchanges for Bitcoin. 
This model would benefit Bitcoin, Chinese investors and the PBoC.

As well intentioned we all are. Nobody can either tell the future or what you should do with your money. Before investing in anything, due diligence my friend, due diligence.
Good luck 
@_date: 2017-02-13 23:20:03
Rule one: understand what you are buying
Rule 2: due diligence
Rule 3: don't put in anymore than you can afford to lose.
Rule 4: only buy on dips 
Rule 5: exit strategy
Rule 6: hodl!!!!!!!!!

Kara Stein, 10.12.15
"While I am not advocating for the adoption or effectiveness of blockchain technology, it appears to offer potential. One can imagine a world in which securities lending, repo and margin financing are all traceable through blockchain’s transparent and open approach to tracking transactions."
"If the market begins to move toward blockchain technology, regulators need to be in a position to lead, harnessing its benefits and responding quickly to potential weaknesses."
@_date: 2017-02-18 19:06:33
Weak hands: are those with little experience and or appetite for negative volatility and dump the coin when price declines a bit adding to the price drop. Followers FOMO...
Whales: large amounts of bitcoin, which can actually influence the price. If they power buy (FOMO follow), price goes up, if they power sell, price goes down (FOMO follow). 
As the FOMO are just the followers, the whales intended goal is compounded with these FOMO's.
Whales do this to pump the prices and dump the coin and once low enough buy cheaper coins with more cash than before.
Example: if I have 5000BTC, bought at 950$ and sell at say 1000$. 250000$ profit.
The market gets flooded with coins, price drops, FOMOs sell and now instead of 5000btc being sold, you might have the double, say 10000btc and price goes to 920.
Now the whale buys bit by bit also know as consolidation, cause if he buys all at once, price goes up. So now he buys on average price of say 950 again, he will now own 5263 Btc because that's how much profit he made before plus the initial investment.
Wash and repeat. They do it all the time.

@_date: 2017-02-18 17:34:10
Weak hands and whales will drop bitcoin to a max limit of $550 (though I doubt it'll reach that far). Then it will begin to build up again in the hope the next ETF dated 30 March gets approved.

Good luck hodler!!
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:16:57
I say the best negotiating tactic is pain. Pain for the miners is bitcoin price decrease and transaction decrease which also affects price per transaction.
Bitcoin Hodler - Greed is good
Miners - pain is goooodddd
They need to fall in line, that simple. They pit transaction in the blocks and get paid for it. That is what the money is for. They don't like it, Fork Off

In regards to your analogy, who would be Tor and who would be the police?
I believe BU &amp; Core have in there own belief Btc best interest at heart. 
That said, the issue here is becoming more political than technical. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:57:43
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:01:50
A compromise needs to be achieved. That is perhaps the most elusive point. You must understand that for there to be progress, compromise is needed. Otherwise we get a Brexit!
Besides, I personally believe in Core road map, most importantly in the Core Dev team. If anyone can make BU work and work with Core, it is the Core Dev team.

@_date: 2017-03-25 02:08:11
Great post! 
I think the economic majority is already making it clear it is for Core. Dumping bitcoin, lowering tx and lowering price of tx.
If the miners dont see this yet, they are going to feel it, it's going to get painful. We should reach out to each camp and stop this madness by empathising, uniting and working together to make bitcoin what it was always intended to be.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:15:54
At the rate miners r signalling, October will b a bit late. Not that the BU code will b ready I suspect...
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:43:27
In essence I personally feel the community is dividing due to the path to take. Weakening its foundation, this must be addressed!
 BU &amp; Core should cease to exist in there current forms. Only one Dev camp  should exist, all dev' from all camps would fall under one umbrella, this way nobody loses face (big deal for Asian culture). 
Merge the two solutions into one, hard fork with a larger Block size and Segwit....
Any future technical scaling decision will be decided by Dev's after a consensus mandate has been handed to the team.

I think he is funded by some very important people in China. Besides, this new miner farm being built in China for Bitmain, put it this way...PBoC is not only aware but actually invested in it. Cause once it goes live, which is in around October, he'll have hashing influence

Sound money = Decentralisation + Core 
I want to control my money, not some authority, corporation/s or miners.
I want my money to be in the safest safety box, maintained guarded by the best of the best with values that align with mine. Core.
Why would I entrust my wealth to miners, corporations. Etc. There is a reason why Bitcoin was invented &amp; it was top stop manipulation, corruption &amp; business interests from taking our money.

I think the adoption phase of blockchain or rather bitcoin is incomparable to new technologies mentioned in your examples. Being a store of value so unlike anything we have seen before, with all it's complexities takes getting time to get to grips with; its potential and implications not even we can begin to imagen.
I believe we are half way through the early adoption phase. But, hey, what do I know?
