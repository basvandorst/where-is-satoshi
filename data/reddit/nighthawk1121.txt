Claimed mine on my trezor device. Very clear instructions from the guys at trezor. Did that to avoid this exact situation. Now what to do with all of this BCH?

That is impressive. My BTC is already 60% of the value of my entire 401k. My 401k is 12 years old and my BTC / alt holdings are only about 2.5 years. I am not sure off hand the amount of up front fiat I have put into each, but I do know I have put a small fraction of capital into BTC as compared to the giant 401k weekly contributions. However, there is a level of tax advantages a 401k has but I am sure those benefits will not outweigh the long term potential of BTC.

Been buying with dollar cost averaging weekly and hodling for about 3-4 years now and researching this groundbreaking technology. My favorite responses to any of my friends who trash it with baseless bullshit are as follows: 
1) Tell me why it will fail. 
2) If you are so certain it will fail, then why don't you short it? You could make a lot of money, pal.

Father in law is visiting last week. Wife asks him if he's heard of bitcoin. He said "yes." Wife says "what do you think about it?" He said "I wouldn't put any real money into it. Wasn't the guy who runs bitcoin into some shady stuff?" He has a degree from Harvard and a Wharton MBA. I just kept my mouth shut. Would take me hours to explain to him. I shall have the last laugh. 
Also "guy who runs bitcoin." Lol. Like it's some guy sitting in a huge executive chair looking out over his land.

I look at things in terms of the % "share" I have in the overall bitcoin ecosystem. Relative to other cryptos it seems bitcoin is the most scarce. Seems the high price will be similar to a Berkshire Hathaway stock share. People look at the price as say "nope" and buy something else. I hate to make that comparison but that is how the general pop will look at the situation. It's still my dream to get in the 21 club...��
