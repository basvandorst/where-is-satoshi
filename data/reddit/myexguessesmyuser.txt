Bitcoin is so unnecessarily insecure about bitcoin cash. Relax. Bitcoin has the name recognition, the market cap, the highest value, everything, really, and by a large margin. Bitcoin needs to focus on proper execution of its plan, growth, and educating the public, not quibbling with alt coins.

I heard the real life guy get interviewed on the radio the other day, he’s now motivational speaker and he teaches people about how to be a good salesman while still being ethical. He’s now sober and very committed to his family. It sounded like his life ended up being a happy ending after all.

If you did that, congrats. Over time, it’s unlikely that will continue to be a winning strategy. But hey, if you called it correctly a few times then good for you.

Exactly. The market cap on bitcoin cash is impossible to accurately estimate.

Today bitcoin was worth $4,000. So 250 bitcoins would be worth $1m USD minus fees and taxes, which would be substantial.

This is true, and especially good advice if you plan on playing the market. If you just plan on holding until you’re old and betting on bit coin being a thing that always continues to grow, then it doesn’t really matter. Guessing the market correctly makes an insignificant difference over time as long as the market continues to grow.

WSB is comedy and satire based around losing money. They aren’t into bitcoin for lack of material.

I️ have followed bitcoin a long time and I️ think I️ understand its proposed value as much as anyone, but I️ am still skeptical about what is driving the value right now. And I️ think everyone should be.

USD isn’t the strongest currency in the world as is. The British pound is worth more, for example. All currencies are only worth as much as you can get for them. If USD is worthless, you hope a different currency is worth something or you hope that you can buy and sell things with bitcoin. Otherwise, I hope you know a thing or two about farming.

I hope it drops that low. I was expecting the last post fork to drop lower than it did and I missed the best spot to buy more. :(

Anyone who is outright dismissive of the greater fool theory simply hasn't spent enough time thinking about the value proposition(s) of bitcoin. No one knows for sure what bitcoin's true value is, and a majority of the dismissive comments in this subreddit are immature, intellectually and financially. 
It's possible that bitcoin as a store of value is worth $7k USD. It's possible that it isn't. Is it more likely that the reason bitcoin is trading at $7k USD today because people suddenly recognized its worth as a store of value or because they see the insane returns you can get by dumping money into bitcoin? 
If the latter is even *possible*, then the greater fool theory is a concern that should not readily be dismissed.

The question I often ponder as I buy more bitcoin is if being a reserve form of money is enough to keep driving demand for bitcoin if it becomes accepted that bitcoin will never have significant value as a payment system.
It seems like initially, both things were proposition values of bitcoin, but the trend is away from bitcoin as a payment system and trending toward bitcoin as a store of wealth. If bitcoin has little or no inherent value as a payment system, then I wonder if that's enough for bitcoin to continue to grow and keep its value.
Gold, as an analogy, has other inherent values besides being a store of wealth. Gold is useful in electronics, jewelry, etc... If bitcoin turns out to be purely a store of wealth, the things that keep it valuable seem to be: it's not in a bank, it's not controlled by a government, and there is a constant demand for it. 
This isn't a well formed analysis, just a rough thought that I ponder frequently.

It seems like this fork is horrendous PR for bitcoin coming at a moment when there is a lot of new interest in bitcoin investing. Can someone ELI5 why this is necessary and why the timing is now when it could be self destructive?
