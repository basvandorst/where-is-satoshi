Sorry mate, but doing business in Australia is a bit of a passion of mine, also doing business in bitcoin. I'm going to call BS on most of what you've written. It's pretty clear that you don't fully understand business in Australia. CGT isn't a tax of 50%, it's a tax on 50% of your profits at the normal tax rate. Eg. If I make $100k, I pay tax on $50k, if it's through the business, then it could be up to 30%, therefore I pay $15k tax on the $100k profit.
Please speak to a competent accountant before giving advice like this crap, because all you're doing is scaremongering and getting facts all fucked up. Especially your 20% gst tax claim.

Love it, great idea. Just set up a buy/sell for Adelaide Airport, South Australia.
