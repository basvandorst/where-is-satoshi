Disguised Whales manipulating public opinion through price scares at key news events
Keeping monetary-slavery control is top priority
So many tricks up in their sleeves
Keep your eyes open

Just the fact that a complete ground floor of a commercial store front in a busy intersection of the city is promoting an alternative to fiat. Sorry it didn't fulfill your pixel standards

Really dont know what to say about this ad.
I am into crypto to step in a different direction from Financial slavery and from Feudal Banker overlords.
The new overlords are becoming the exchanges. Crazy the fees they are charging.   
Waiting for the time were we dont need them for the fiat jump and individual users start exchanging directly peer to peer. 
  
Guess that it just takes a group, community, town or city deciding which chain to use.
 Selecting a chain with no fees or very low fees for small  transactions. IOTA is heading in the right direction 
Selecting a chain such as Bitcoin for savings and larger transaction amounts requesting miners and validators.

Correction, 
People MUST learn, otherwise the technology is not fulfilling it's purpose.
Are the exchanges becoming the new bankers??��

The crypto an individual holds reflects the kind of wealth distribution system shim supports. 
Hard to unfollow the status quo default system we've been programmed to use if we keep pegging our units of exchange to an imperialist $... 
Are you in it for a change in the current wealth distribution system or to climb up  the pyramid and get invited to the rich people club?

Note what's going on with Theter and it's "stable coins" "backed" by USD.
Your usual money printers are slowly and silently overtaking the crypto market...
Guess some people don't get it. Do you want to participate in a chain that still uses the same unit of monetary system that the petrol dollar and last century's control enslavers have forced on the world economy?
Choose the chains you are going to participate on wisely. It might free you or still enslave you

Not credit card or cash... Yet.... Btc has really turned into store of value, not suitable for daily purchases or small payments. Transfer rates are higher than traditional systems. 
Use btc for savings and choose your chain, preferably one with low or close to zero tx rates for everyday transactions. Iota or Nano are a good example. 
Remember crypto s purpose is to free us from the federal reserve claws so please  don't pump money into "stable coins"

Stable coins for traditional currencies are around the corner, traditional currencies is how the IMF and Central Banks maintain the grip of economic sovereignty.
