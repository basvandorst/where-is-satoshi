Easiest for beginners is the website or app Coinbase. However once you get the hang of that, GDAX (owned by the same company) is much better with no fees and such.

Holy shit dude I'm sorry how hardcore attacked you got in this thread. These people are seriously pulling stuff out of thin air and then bad mouthing you off of pure assumption. Sorry man. I'm just sitting here shaking my head.

Yes indeed. Upvotes for both of you

How is no one talking about the NiceHash hack? This is big news for BTC.

Appreciate it!

Why would you need to force people to use a system that is better than the previous one? People like saving money. Segwit saves money. I'm sure everyone (except for miners) wish tx fees were actually reasonable so we could get on with widespread adoption and tackle bigger issues. The biggest thing holding segwit adoption back is the fact that Coinbase/GDAX have few competitors at the moment and rule the market space. Especially in the app store. And have not implemented it yet. As soon as they do the 12ish percent that segwit is will become much much higher. Why would you need to force people to want to save money?

So basically it would require a little bit more disk space to run a node? Which in the future may become a problem?

And widespread segwit adoption

Keep doing exactly what you're doing and you'll be glad soon enough. All these weak hands are gonna be sad they missed out. I'll probably be trading for some more thanks to this.

I'm glad i wasn't the only one. Literally didn't even bother reading past the title after seeing that. How to lose credibility right from the get go.

Competition is great

Keep doing what you're doing man. Happy to read stuff like that.

Just curious, where did you get May 7th from? That just happens to be my birthday, and I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast so I'm intrigued now. Thanks!
