Yeah but isn’t the ownership of bitcoin centralized?  What I mean by that is it seems like most of the Bitcoin in existence is owned by a very few number of people/organizations, whereas most of the owners like us peons here own .00001 to 10 bitcoins.  I dont know the exact numbers but it doesnt seem good for the common person and adoption.

The moral of the story is that the people cheering for Bitcoins price to go up to a million due to hyperinflation are not taking into account that every thing else will go up in unison and its purchasing power will remain the same.  The only way Bitcoins purchasing power will increase (increase in purchasing power is the end goal, not nominal value) and empower you is if the masses realize its unique value and utility and an increase in demand is realized in our current economic state, not in a hyperinflationary one.

“bringing huge amounts of metals will only crash the current markets”
I doubt that, if we mine all the gold on Earth, price will go up.  Then if we have to resort to mining gold from an asteroid, the price will skyrocket even more due to the difficulty of doing it.  This is a dumb comparison to Bitcoin.

You still dont get it, you cant just go there and scoop up gold with a shovel and then ship it back to Earth.  You need a mining operation, lots of heavy equipment that break and need repairs.  You need to process the rock you mine, thats an extra operation.  If you dont process it there on the asteroid, you will need to send hundreds of tons of rock back to Earth to get a few ounces of gold.  You will need a NASA or Space X on the asteroid to safely launch rockets and send it back and forth.  The initial setup for all this even if it was plausible would be in the hundreds of billions before any gold would be brought back, plus the cost of obtaining the gold.  Again this comparison is idiotic.

The supply is not being cut in half, the rate of creation is, which is totally different.  As of right now, there is no shortage of supply of bitcoin with current demand, hence the price drop.

Because they just like things to work, they dont care to understand how it works.  Right now you need to understand how it works to use it.  Until we have easy user interfaces and price stability, mass adoption by the general wont happen.  Also
most people holding bitcoin want the price to shoot up, so they can cash out but then that would bring the price crashing back down again, shooting yourself in the foot if you are wanting a longstanding currency.

You are doing yourself a favor by not understanding it because its just useless information, waste of space.

Technically its a BMW!  No where near what the Supra used to be!  The 4th gen Supra’s are legends and worth more than they were brand new, and thats saying a lot for a 25 year old car.

Ok agreed on nominal price but what will its purchasing power be compared to now?
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:26:26
There are 4th generation Supra’s (1993-1998) that are worth 10+ BTC in dollar value today, not bad for a 25 year old car.

I dont think the price is gonna do what you all think it will do, institutions are not going to invest and let the general retail investor profit off of them, nope, not going to happen.
@_date: 2019-09-08 04:33:10
The only thing different this time is that its not gonna happen.

They should just give those wallets to Venezuelan people and teach them how to use it, would prob benefit them more as a country.  Good on Trezor for donating though!

I know not all, but a majority of the general public did.  I personally bought some before the hype, and after so Im still feeling some of the sting.

My chart analysis shows the price went up.  Could go up more, but can also move lower.

You lose net worth which makes it so you cant sell.  Stop with this you only lose if you sell bullshit.
