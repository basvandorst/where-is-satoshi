Enjoy the ride. Look long term
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:45:09
Good man. Bigger picture thinking makes this all seem like tiny bumps on the road
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:43:11
Welcome and please be seated it’s going to be a wild ride :)
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:48:54
I’m blessed to have a wife who understands fiat is fscked. Sorry for the sh1t storm
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:37:11
Everything happens for a reason I guess. Don’t beat yourself up about it. I almost bought 1000BTC when it was $1 so don’t feel bad. Long term will still be good.
@_date: 2018-09-02 09:30:31
BTrash no thank you. Bitcoin yes!!!
@_date: 2018-09-11 08:54:21

Amen brother ;)
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:11:48
It’s the current usage of the language. You really going to argue c++ is less error prone to Java.. mass adoption needs a language which is already commonly used 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:22:35
I had the same view for a while but then realised bitcoin not bcash is the one that will holds its value. Ditch the bcash for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:04:31
I vote Java.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:22:27
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:07:51
It’s because there is such a low supply to trade with the price can swing so rapidly 
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:02:35
Roger is that you again ��

Your right there
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:33:33
100% :)
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:45:34
There probably will be a decent period of consolidation 
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:03:40
Anyone can see it’s in a mess.. hashgraph is not decentralised at all and BTrash is.. well trash

Agreed! Ver and Craig probably hang out for beers on a regular basis �� 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:16:57
Funny enough the ones I’ve already deployed are all still there.. people know the change is coming..
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:39:06
Just waiting for train I’ve already seen two people give it a looong second look :) the one guy funny enough jumped on this phone straight away :p
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:04:59
Yeah would have to agree on that one. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:55:09
Normal FUD trying to deter people from crypto
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:16:43

BCash is an alt-coin copied from bitcoin by a few individuals trying to sell the idea of increasing the block size will solve scalability which is obviously not going to work. Keep with Bitcoin which will be complimented by lightning network to scale :)
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:04:30
It’s hard money but not yet ready for using as payment method. This will come in time. Right now it’s store of value.

@_date: 2018-10-23 22:40:01

Put 50% into bitcoin and the rest into alt coins, when there is a alt coin run make sure you adjust your holdings to the original percent that way u continue to increase bitcoin holdings ;)

Patience young one.
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:02:04
Yeah I agree, give it time. LN will make it seamless and it will get less clunky in future wallets. Until then; BTC is a store of value which I think it will remain even when it’s easier to pay with.
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:50:25

Stop these stupid memes and grow up. Get out if your scared :) this place is not for the weak!
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:23:28
I think this will be a downside to having make a user wait to sync. Can you multithread this process to speed it up? Or is it a serial process?
@_date: 2018-06-19 23:10:39
Please, it’s a piece of paper..
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:02:37

Still nothing wrong with riding the alt coin wave to accumulate bitcoin as the end goal :)
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:27:26
Yes tell them Roger is shilling BTrash :)
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:50:33
Yes it’s still syncing to chain but my undestanding is this should work in background but I’ve been running the app in bg for hours...
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:11:47
Lol agree
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:34:57

Not so great on iOS safari
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:05:50
Try make the mobile version more user friendly by using css media queries to scale the website appropriately when being viewed on a mobile device. Also try integrating with coinbase commerce to make the checkout (when paying with crypto) more seamless: 
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:19:38
Just take them to the bank to redeem bitcoin :p

If you bought bitcoin just for the hope of the price don’t bother u probably don’t understand it. If not forget about about it and move on with life and in 5 years check the price :)

You can spot a liar cheat and complete manipulator when u see one from a mile away.. Roger Ver is that kind of person ��
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:28:19
Yep and any store
@_date: 2019-01-18 04:55:26
Poor Ver thinks his coin is about shilling, it’s about who decides is the right coin ;) Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:28:05
@_date: 2019-01-14 10:51:02
No as bitcoin would just change its sha256 algorithm :) 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:58:34
Good to see no BTrash accepted 
@_date: 2018-11-05 08:49:27

Thanks mate. I’m blessed to have fibre to the node in my estate.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:28:03
Interesting to know. So if im not transacting with the bitcoin core wallet; there is no point in running the node?

I HODL because I don’t trust the system to sustain us for the foreseeable future. I believe in a free market in which we as the citizens decide on how to operate our finances and drive out the next generations of thinkers and adopters. To the moon! ��

Is it not verifying transactions? I'm planning on configuring it to accept inbound connections:
"When Bitcoin Core starts, it establishes 8 outbound connections to other full nodes so it can download the latest blocks and transactions. If you just want to use your full node as a wallet, you don’t need more than these 8 connections—but if you want to support lightweight clients and other full nodes on the network, you must allow inbound connections"
