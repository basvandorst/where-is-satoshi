Can only speculate as to why Colored Coins. Counterparty has - by far - the most features, most transaction, most 3rd party tools, largest network.
My guess is that Medici is highly centralized and the limitations of colored coins are (ironically) better for meeting regulatory standards. With Counterparty it would be impossible to limit ownership/transfer/trade only to white listed addresses.

Does anyone actually use Colored Coin?
Counterparty has 2 block explorers, wallets (web, android, iphone), plenty of tools (Tokenly, vending machines), an active forum with support, etc.
Guys, the network effect matters.

You can do all this with tools from  too.
Advantage is that these broadcasts are Counterparty formatted, thus can be viewed on Blockscan and Counterpartychain.

This all ready exist. It's called Dogeparty and is a Counterparty fork on Dogecoin.

Amen to that. Thank God there is at least one altcoiner out there focusing on the technology and not on pumping price.

FYI- 12,000 Counterparty assets have been registered to date. That's 12,000 altcoins running on top of Bitcoin! Crazy 'ey!

If you broadcast a Bitcoin address via Dogeparty or Dogecoin address via Counterparty, can you then make someting of a sidechain?

Conterparty is perfect for voting. It's SWARM's implementation that is messed up. Kinda like Bitcoin is perfect as money, while Bitcoin Foundation is a showcase of incompetence.
