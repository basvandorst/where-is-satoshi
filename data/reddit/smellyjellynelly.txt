Only when it goes up. 
No, Bitcoin is not a hedge. It's way too unstable for that. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:22:55
Haha no they're not meaningless. Wtf?
How the hell did that comment get 19 upvotes?
Seriously, what's the point of your comment and the ridiculous amounts of upvotes? That Bitcoin somehow isn't unstable??
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:05:39
I love how tons of people have issues with your offen non-existing support. Only when they come to Reddit and make it public you suddenly show up and pretend to be helpful. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:13:00
This has been answered 300 times before. You will get scammed. Some common sense would've answered your question already. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:39:47
Stop with this shit please. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:14:30
Yes, i wish this sub would finally understand this. After a few weeks of pump post after pump post on the mainpage about how Bitcoin is exploding in India the average Bitcoiner thinks something huge is going on there. There just isn't. Bitcoin usage is so extremely small in that huge country that you can pretty much say it's simply non-existant. 
A country with 1.3 billion people is exchanging 40 coins a day on lbc. This isn't worth one news article. Let alone the 40 a day that get posted here. 
But i know explaining this fact will piss people off and in turn will call me a troll, report me and downvote me. As before. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 00:13:47
You ok?
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:01:29
No. 
It can go up or down at any time. 
Jesus Christ. Is this really worth being downvoted for? Let me guess, i'm not allowed to suggest Bitcoin might also go down?
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:53:07


What's the source of all these facts?
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:42:42


You don't have much self-awereness, do you?
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:23:06
Use Paypal. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:07:17
How am i trolling?
Tell me, how am i trolling?
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:53:18
You know, posting a source might help.
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:00:37


I clicked the link but i bet you posted the wrong link as it doesn't show Bitcoin all over the news in India. But i guess that makes me a troll, right?
@_date: 2016-11-26 06:49:24
Stop with this ridiculous India circle jerk that's been going on for weeks now. 
Bitcoin is near non-existant in India. It's not worth the 100's of threads here. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 01:08:01
Wth are you talking about. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:28:42
So you can't find ONE single troll post while you just claimed 90% are troll posts?
That's quite amazing. 
Maybe it's time to stfu now and stop stalking me. You're getting creepy. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:09:52
Please tell me he is joking. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:33:40
Yeah, the trend is that nobody in India cares about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:25:11
It's extremely unstable. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:04:59
Even in that case Bitcoin is a hortible hedge. 
You will not believe me of course and you're obviously posting ij the one place where everyone agrees with you. 
Here is an idea. Why don't you go out of this sub and ask some people who studied this stuff. Ask them about Bitcoin as a hedge for whatever and report back. 
I'll wait here with my popcorn. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:53:53
That's odd because the majority here expects mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:15:13
Yes, i understand it now and how bad it is. I had no idea who he was at first. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:29:24
Blaming the user AGAIN?
@_date: 2016-11-17 01:38:11
Jesus Christ. Paranoid much?
@_date: 2016-11-16 17:56:14
They never took Bitcoin. They take dollars from a processor. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:37:51
I bet in your mind this is somehow relevant to Bitcoin 
Why don't you explain us why exactly. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:35:21
Look back at your post and then try to realize how much information we get out of your post and if that possibly could answer your question. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:47:22
So invest in a completely unknown and useless (in India) internet currency and then convince companies to start accepting this?
This is so idiotic that i almost have to report you for trolling. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:36:45
You can't be your own libertarian bank AND ask the police to fix your stuff. Things don't work that way. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:10:48
I was talking to you. Obviously. Learn how to read. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:21:15
Just stop man. It's getting sad. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:34:42
They didn't ban cash. Stop your FUD. This is getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 07:18:12
The rupee didn't go down. Wtf are you talking about. Also a hedge is supposed to be safe. Bitcoin is probably the most unsafe investment i can think of. How you fail to understand even the basics about a hedge is beyond me. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:10:37
Are you still searching? Or does it not matter that you can't find a single troll post and ban me anyway for not 100% participating in the circle jerk?
As a bitcoin owner and user why shouldn't i be allowed to post here? I nowhere see a rule that every post needs to be good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:06:00
Have you ever been to India? Do you have any idea how these people live?
Look at this picture
What reality do you live in if you think these people are gonna start using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:02:39
It dropped 32 dollars in the last few hours. Please don't use the word FUD anymore till you know how and when to use it because this made me cringe hard. 
I love how you edited your comment (attack) because you were wrong and i am getting downvoted to fuck. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:07:03
It's in my post history but not in this thread. It got removed. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:01:31
Why haven't the mods blocked this spam yet? Instead of deleting the same message every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:36:29
Because there are way less people interested in Bitcoin. You Einstein. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:38:22
Agreed. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:20:02
Your caretaker let you behind the computer by yourself again? 
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:39:51
If i post Bitcoin prices on Twitter will you repost me here as well?
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:02:08
One or more whales bought some coins. You know, like 100's of times before. Usually after that they dump again to take profit. Let me know if i need to explain it even better. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:33:49
Bitcoin is just like transporting gold. Noted. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 05:18:07
How many times did we have this topic already? 100 or so?
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:45:36
Wait, you admit to trolling me (because i point out facts about Bitcoin you don't like) and then talk about me being banned and spamming?
Wow. Just wow. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:56:57
It's called a dump after a pump. Which only happened about 763 times before. 
It's amazing to see how people here everytime there is a dump get completely confused. How is this possible!!! Why does the price go down!!??
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:26:32
Bitcoin user not affected. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:51:18
Let me see what happened here. After you made a crazy cultish and paranoid post i called you paranoid. That upsrt you so much that you started going through my post history, stalked me in other subs and posted three times in a row that i'm mentally ill. 
Which is highly ironic as everything about you screams mental illness. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:30:06
How the hell do they keep approving this?
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:05:13
Yes a few people are buying Bitcoin and apparently they are hard to obtain there so the price is higher than normal. 
The Bitcoin economy there is pretty much non-existant and you're completely delusional if you think anything big is happening there. 
India won't make you rich. Just like Greece didn't, like Venezuela didn't or any other country didn't. Get over it. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:54:58
Another thread on the mainpage about a country with 1.3 billion that exchanges just 40 coins a day through Localbitcoin?
Really? 
If anything it just makes us look so desperate. So much circle jerking over a country where Bitcoin is pretty much non-existant. How can a few 100 people using Bitcoin in that huge country result in 100's of threads and articles for weeks? 
@_date: 2016-11-12 05:50:24
Every single time!
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:08:25
What do you mean? It overwrites your back up wallet with a new, empty wallet?
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:32:48
You will lose your money. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 02:51:11
What parts of the world are you talking about exactly??
You're not implying India is causing this small price pump, right. That would be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:18:14
I started buying around 20 dollars. I just noticed something i didn't understand but what was going up fast. I took the risk and invested. Turned out well. I sold during the top in 2013 and bought back in the 200 area. 
Just do the opposite of what the crowd does. 
When this sub gets all crazy from hype and screams buy buy buy it's usually time to sell sell sell. When people here rage quit because the price was in a huge dip and hardcore bear market i realized it was time to buy back. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:44:23
90% troll comments. In that case can you show me a few of my troll comments? I'm waiting. 
If you won't then we both know you're full of shit and paranoid. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:08:16
Why? So lets say this random family now has all their money sitting in Bitcoin. Now what? What is that gonna solve?
Edit - when you can't answer it just downvote it. Right guys?
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:46:25
Wait what? Are you somehow suggesting that the 2 parts of the title are connected?
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:57:50
Uh yes, i get that. That's why i replied to him, not you. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:03:13


Can you show me the math for that?
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:32:22
That is ridiculous. The price could drop 50% while they hold their coins. Completely ridiculous comment. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:38:00
Interesting. 100% anti bitcoin trash? Please show me one, just one anti bitcoin post i made. Just one. 
I'm waiting. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:09:29
Mad? Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:34:15
Show me one post where i'm trolling you fucking clown! Or stfu!
God, you're fucking pathetic. Idiot. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:06:19


Yes? Unless you live in North Korea i guess. 


Some banks might close accounts if you trade Bitcoin. This has more to do with money laundering concerns than opposition.  


That doesn't make sense. There is no Bitcoin company. None of these sites control Bitcoin. 


It's selling for more in India but the volume is so tiny it doesn't affect the big exchanges. One big trader in the US can do more volume in 1 trade than the whole of India does in a day. 


Nobody knows. We can't look into the future. I personally would recommend buying a few coins but don't put crazy money in it. It's a gamble. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:02:58
Why is there always so much confusion here when the price goes down?
What do you expect exactly? That it just goes up and up for no reason? That's normal to you but going down isn't?
Traders trade. They control the price. Now they dump, tomorrow they pump. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:58:24
A small pump occured. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:57:06
Can you show me how you calculated those percentages?
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:37:16
Bitcoin is highly, highly unstable. 
Please stick to reality. Posts like yours are ridiculous. 
Just in the last 2 hours it dropped 25 dollars. 
One fake news item that claims Satoshi is found or China bans Bitcoin will cause the price to drop 200 dollars easily. 
It's extremely unstable. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:42:29
Why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:04:44


@_date: 2016-11-26 12:38:38
Can you show me one troll post? Just one? 
I'm waiting. 
Your comment is highly delusional by the way. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:17:10


Stop using this ridiculous logic. We're talking consumers here. Their transaction is instant. They don't care if it takes 10 years for it to be irreversable. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 19:41:27
You shouldn't use the default Bitcoin wallet. 
Yes, the irony is thick. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:48:59
It is all over the news in Inda? I find that very hard to believe. 
7 downvotes so far because eventhough i'm right, if it's not good for Bitcoin you get downvoted anyway. This sub has decided that Bitcoin is exploding in India so anyone who says something different must be censored. 
And of course the best part is how the link the OP posted proves me right and him wrong. But don't let stupid facts stop the circle jerk guys. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:48:38


Uh what? Do these "reporters" just make their shit up while writing?
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:31:34
Wait, hold on. So wondering how these poor people are gonna use Bitcoin is trolling? Seriously? That is all you can come up with?
Have you got something better or is that your final proof i am trolling?
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:28:08
Which is?
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:38:27
Yes they do. We realized that after 200 posts explaining this. Can we stop now?
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:48:55
My people? Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:16:19
Again, we are talking about consumers. You're using an argument about merchants. It's irrelevant. 
And for some reason this is always brought up when someone mentions Bitcoin is slow. 
It is irrelevant. Even if cc transactions take a century. It's instant to the consumer. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:20:42
I had the same experience. It was unusable on a 4 year old computer. And i've seen TONS of posts here claiming the same thing. Stop blaming the user. 


I didn't go through his history. I know his username and the shilling he does. I warned others. 
But please answer me. You are not gonna stalk me are you? I already got 2 online stalkers from this sub for pointing out something negative about Bitcoin. I'm afraid one of you people might end up shooting me or something. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:45:28
Maybe you should look up what hedging is and how it works. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:56:53
Any sources for this?
Other than delusional articles from Bitcoin circle jerk sites?
How unexpected. I'm getting downvoted instead. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:16:35
Uh what?
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:31:06
Yes, just like everyone else. What else?
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:27:49


Not a serious problem for who? A few techies using Bitcoin for a transaction or 2 or for the big public who is supposed to use this in daily life? Because for one of those 2 it would simply make it unusable obviously. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:06:34
Very good point. Bitcoin as a payment system will never ever go mainstream if the buyer has to pay an x amount of money just to buy their daily goods. 
How some people here believe otherwise is beyond me. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 19:21:01
What are you talking about? Who is losing 100% of the value?
@_date: 2016-11-21 13:13:38
Questions 1 to 4: nobody knows. Anybody who tells you otherwise is lying. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:36:56
Why not directly fantasize about the end result? You winning a lottery and becoming filthy rich? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:52:00
If only a tiny, tiny percentage of the Chinese would move to Bitcoin because of this the price would explode. 
Despite the 100's of pump posts here about China this simply isn't happening. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:15:41
Glad you realized how dumb your comment was. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 05:14:27
Yes 32 dollars. That's what you call unstable. No matter how yawn it is to you. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:26:48
You are saying that i am a troll? Are you serious? So fat there seems to be one troll post in this thread in it happens to be yours. As someone else also suggested. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:48:01
Nobody uses Bitcoin in India. That's all you need to know. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:32:52
Has nothing to do with it. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:22:07
Bitcoin is highly unstable. No matter how much cherry picking you do. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:42:30
Doesn't matter! 
Get ready for 50 posts a day about how Bitcoin is exploding in Australia. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:50:53
Haha, no there isn't. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:47:49
Here maybe?
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:24:58
But this sub loves ZH as they claim weekly how some currency or bank or economy is gonna crash. But i guess then it's ok to post it here?
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:59:21
We will never see these prices again, right?
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:19:38
Things are looking good at the moment. Now we have to wait till some exchange gets hacked or Satoshi gets "found". Because always something happens when things are bullish. 
Is Bitcoinity having issues by the way?
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:10:00
Holy shit. Move away from the keyboard and take your meds. You're insane. 
Also, i didn't delete any posts you freak. Stop harrassing me. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:38:28
We don't know how many Bitcoin users there are but if i had to guess i'd say something small like 0.1. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:07:42
Can you show me where i'm trolling please. Just one or two posts will do. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:28:50
The non-existing lightening network will solve everything, right?
@_date: 2016-11-23 06:44:54
The fact that there is such a difference is because arbitrage isn't working. 
If it would then there wouldn't be such a difference in the first place. 
Also there is hardly any volume so it's not interesting to someone who has the possibilities to set this up. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:26:10
When the price goes down a few 100 dollars how good of a hedge is it then?
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:09:35
Huh what? I've been reading this sub for years. How the fuck does it matter what my sign up date is. 
That's one of the dumbest things i've read all day. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 00:22:28
Maybe in the fantasy land you live in. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:26:57
Submit some positive comments?
@_date: 2016-11-14 21:17:39
I could give you 10+ reasons without thinking. Your question is so ridiculous i'm not even gonna bother explaining it. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:22:08
Just because it is less unstable than a few years ago doesn't mean it's stable. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:08:39
I love how this sub completely stopped using it when they found out it wasn't gonna go mainstream and wouldn't pump the price and make every "hodler" rich. 
So nobody gave a shit about it anymore. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:52:04
Quality post. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 02:40:57
Can we just stop with these ridiculous articles please. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 18:54:22
Yeah well, if you can't handle someone on the internet who "talks annoying" without hitting a downvote button then maybe you have some deeper issues you need to take care of first. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:45:40
Fraud obviously. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:28:32
The amount of times i've read this same comment about a different price point in the last few years. But i'm sure this time it's different, right?
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:02:37
Does it matter? It's always some far away country this sub comes up with. Always some economic reason. While in reality it's just traders trading. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:02:04
Traders and hype. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:23:01
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:19:20
Yeah well, maybe most normal people aren't busy with stuff like that. I don't look at account ages just to figure if someone might be a sockpuppet. That's some high level paranoia right there. 
Very unhealthy. You might want to reconsider some of the choices in your life. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:02:52
I'm not gonna play this stupid game. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:09:56
Shitpost. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:10:07
What a load of bs. Do you understand what you are actually typing?? The ath which was about 500 dollars higher then we are now doesn't really count so we are at the ath now. 
How does that make any sense? Why is this almost the top comment???
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:47:00
I always say the same thing about people who can't handle a forum without downvoting every comment they don't like. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:44:49
A phone is usable. A bitcoin in India isn't. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 18:59:57
It's been around 700, including 670 for months. There is nothing odd about it dropping to 680 if the price gets stopped at 750. 
It also could go to 200 or 1000 by tomorrow. Stability means nothing in Bitcoin land. 
One (fake) news item can change everything within hours. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:59:07
Uh you posted it? You tell me. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 05:54:30
I don't downvote people. I'm older than 12. 
Any more accusations? I'm getting kinda tired of it. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:57:59
Can you do 2 things for me please?
1: explain to me how i am a troll?
2: point out ONE, only one troll post from me. 
If you can't then apologize for the ridiculous accusation. 
Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:42:07
I have reason to believe you are full of shit and simply try to pump the price. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:33:45


Apart, of course, from the TONS of others who posted here and other places who had the same problem. 
So far in this small thread me, the OP and another person had the same problem. And all you do is blame the user. We're lying, trolling or have some mysterious hardware that is causing issues.  
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:15:00
What's the daily volume on that site?
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:44:04
Completely nonsense. Sorry.

Oh god, now it's Italy again who will take Bitcoin to the moon? Man, we're still circle jerking about India. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:45:12
It spiked because it's hard to get coins. This has nothing to do with adoption in India. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:07:29
Scam. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:30:12
Who is supposed to answer this exactly? Nostradamus?
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:00:49
2 things i don't understand. 
The article writers claims a shortage of bitcoins in India resulting in a higher price. How? Why? 
Why the ban on certain bank notes results in people buying bitcoins over there? They can simply exchange their smaller notes to bigger notes at the local bank. How is bitcoin relevant in this story. Bitcoin is pretty much unusable in India. What's the point of buying it? Am i missing something?
@_date: 2016-11-23 08:20:00
And another nonsense article with a sensationalist title. The reporting on Bitcoin sites is just so, so bad. Just clickbait and bullshit. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:33:20
Are you still searching for a troll post or are you just gonna ignore my question because you know you were wrong?
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:03:37
The fantasy land countries?
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:04:05
I'm not sure wtf i just read but you are either very young or very high right now. 
Edit: or just trolling of course. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:48:30
Excuse me? Can you point out 1 (one) troll post from me? Just one. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:37:06
Steam, steam and steam. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:03:19
Oh ok. Mainstream adoption any day now. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:50:38
It's ridiculous. I wish the mods would do something about these absurd accusations. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 16:42:24
Come on, do you really have to ask?
@_date: 2016-11-15 10:33:14
Huh what? A small pump (and shortly after a dump) when Trump got elected is proof Bitcoin is a safe haven??
I'm not sure what's worse. That soneone writes this nonsense, that it gets posted here or that people actually believe it. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:34:56
Bitcoin is unusable in India. It's not a great alternative. 
The downvoting is hilarious. Because you don't like certain facts you just downvote me. Crazy. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:25:40
Which people?
Bitcoin is no protection against devaluation because the price of Bitcoin can go down as well. As has done so many times in the past. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:15:45
Who or what would i be shilling for?
Answer me. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:32:52
Right. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:45:41
Wealth preservation until Bitcoin drops 200 dollars in price of course. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:11:56
If you can't consider the fact that something better than Bitcoin might be created in the next ten years then maybe it's time to move away from the keyboard and this sub and get some fresh air. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 00:26:55
You witnessed a pump and dump. Like 100's of times before. When there is hype the whales start a pump, wait for the little fish to follow and then dump. 
There is no China, Venezuela, fundamentals, Greece, Trump and so on. Just traders making money. It's not rocket science. 
Why this still is a mystery to some people is beyond me. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:56:24
Yeah, i'm paying 15 cents at the moment to be sure. I personally don't give a crap. 
I just can't imagine how people defend this and at the same time think mass adoption is around the corner. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:49:44
Do you have any sources on this?
Also what the hell does my account age have to do with this??
@_date: 2016-11-24 01:18:28
So only this mod somehow has that ability? I still don't get it. 
Edit: i get it now. It's an admin, not mod. Sorry, am drunk. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:00:09


You can't be serious. You just can't be. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:06:18
No, troll. I did not start anything. You did. 


I love how you completely ignored your own troll comment. 
Fact is you are trolling me because i pointed out how unstable Bitcoin is. You don't allow anyone saying anything negative about Bitcoin so you then start trolling. Then, while admitting to trolling, suggest that i should be banned. Man...
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:52:24
9000 what?
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:20:03
I am a troll? You are seriously saying that i am a troll because i had massive issues with the core wallet, like many others?
Wow, just wow. 
All those others with the same issues are trolls as well i take it?
Edit: i'm on a 150mb connection you clown. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 13:22:00
It received a couple of downvotes so that's odd. 
Anyway, i guess these attacks on me are fine but my posts get hidden. Sad. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:58:20
Hm that looks interesting. What are the costs involved?
@_date: 2016-11-27 07:54:27
Then it was put back. it was removed earlier on. We're not both making shit up for whatever stupid reason. I even sent the mods an IM about it. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:08:55
Ok so the real story is "criminals use Bitcoin to hide their money". 
Makes sense and fine with me. But i prefer some honest reporting. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:36:45
I'm truly curious what makes you say this. Can you describe what makes me dumb exactly? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:09:23
Why isn't my advice good? If you read his post does this wallet seem like a good choice?
I personally tried the core wallet on an older computer at work and i removed it because it was never able to sync. The wallet is a piece of shit and there are way better options out there. No matter if you like that or not. 
And what's wrong with my other posts? It also gives me a creepy feeling that you went through history just for answering this guy in a way you don't seem to like. Eventhough my comment was correct. 
You're not gonna stalk me, are you?
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:37:16
Indeed. Batshit crazy. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 06:47:02
Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:07:48
Nobody knows what it will do in the long run. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 18:07:42
750 seems to be a difficult point. We really need to get quite a bit past it to get comfortable with the current prices. 
If this doesn't happen soon it will easily go back to the 600's. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 14:53:11
You are correct but nobody here cares. 
Dozens of articles how India is going crazy over Bitcoin are upvoted to the top. Article after article full of fiction and nonsense. 
Bitcoiners are highly critical. But only when something is not good for Bitcoin. If it is good for Bitcoin then nobody gives a crap if it's totally made up bs. 
Bitcoin wise nothing is happening in India. Absolutely nothing. Just like nothing happened in Greece or Venezuela or any other country this sub circle jerks about. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:53:12
We've done this for how many countries now? This month it's India till we find out they won't move to Bitcoin and they won't make the price rise and then it's on to the next country. 
It's getting a bit pathetic. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:08:31
There are 1.3 billion people in India. 40 coins get sold through Localbitcoins a day. I own more coins than their daily volume.  
Let's stop this insane circle jerk that's been going on for weeks now. 
My dog has more Facebook friends than India has Bitcoin users. 
Let's just stop with this nonsense. Let's focus on important things instead. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:47:44
Even if this was true how has this anything to do with this sub or Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:12:05
A bitcoin site claiming a price rise because of a possible Brexit. Yeah, great source. I'm talking about real evidence or proof. 
I'm not saying it's impossible but this sub's idea of why price rises happen are often just ridiculous. 
The OP simply claims that if the Euro is doing bad the Bitcoin price will go up. And anybody who says something else is instantly labelled a troll. 
So far, in 7 years, there is no solid evidence for this claim to be true. It could be true but it's far from a guarantee. 
This sub is really good at creating myths and anyone who doubts it gets reported, downvoted and attacked. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 16:39:46
What are you saying? That a sensationalist bs title is upvoted to the mainpage? Wow, that usually never happens here. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 19:01:31
@_date: 2016-11-15 10:49:07
Huh what? A small pump (and shortly after a dump) when Trump got elected is proof Bitcoin is a safe haven??
I'm not sure what's worse. That someone writes this nonsense, that it gets posted here or that people actually might believe it.
There is just so much bad journalism in Bitcoin land. So, so much. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 01:15:02


Why? Serious question. I have no idea what this is about. 
A mod abusing his powers. Isn't that daily business on Reddit? What's so special about this case?
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:36:33
Yeah well i feel insulted by your first post. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:45:02
Because it's hard to get. Because they can't afford losing money in crazy price swings. Because nobody uses it. Because it can't buy them food. Because it's difficult to use. And probably 10 more reasons. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:46:43
Isn't talking about it? It's all i've seen last few days. 
There is 0 Bitcoin infrastructure in India and it's a way too complicated payment system for mainstream adoption. In its current state it's slow, primitive and difficult to use. I couldn't even imagine explaining how to use Bitcoin to my mother. 
If you need more examples of this just look at the 2 dozen posts a day here by tech savy Bitcoiners who have transactions stuck, money dissapearing and wallets hacked. 
It's almost impossible to get for most people in India and the average Indian can't risk their money dropping 20% overnight. 
I see no reason whatsoever for people over there to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:37:51
Who is they?
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:38:11
I sure hope so. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:02:22
Only a total idiot would buy mining contracts. I'm sure nobody here would fall for that shit. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:19:58
Yes, so?
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:24:38
Excuse me? Wtf are you even talking about??
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:39:29
No.
