True, my biggest worry was that my money was in someone else's pocket. 
Especially satoshidice, their english is really bad and they have no way to contact them. Only reason i've stuck with them is because It's a super small amount i've placed, and they've been around for a while now, and if they were going to run they probably would've already, considering the bankroll is 5 thousand bitcoins.

Now I've seen little plastic bitcoins as a joke but this is an actually bitcoin  that is redeemable actually redeemable, I'm not 100% on how it works but there is a lot of information on the website.

Sounds Really Cool! I was gonna say I couldn't afford an entire bitcoin, but I checked their site and they sell Halves and Tenths of a bitcoin!

Downvote a bot. I'm sure that helped your self esteem.

Hi! 
It might seem hard to believe, but i've never had licorice. I'm looking to get Black Licorice wheels, but it seems you're out of stock.
Any ETA for when they'll be in stock, or any recommendations for someone who's never had licorice?

I don't get it..
Can someone let me in on this inside joke?

This is like those astronomy things you only see every few years, but with bitcoin. Pretty cool to be here.
See you in 4 years!
