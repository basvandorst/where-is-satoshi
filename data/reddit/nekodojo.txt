Lots of folks will say "Use the search" but that is not a great solution.  If you're serious about not wanting the same question asked, the answer is simple: ANSWER IT clearly, DIRECTLY in the sidebar.  
But hey, it's much more fun to sit there and swear at newbies.

I was thinking about signing and verifying signatures, but that could also be spoofed... if someone can create a new address, they can create a new message and sign it.  
Maybe the same people who sell SSL certificates (and presumably verify your business address and identity, etc) could expand their certificates to also "sign" bitcoin addresses?  Seems a stretch.
Another path to this might be to include the bitcoin address in the official web page of the recipient.  For example  (using SSL) can include the donation address as part of the headers.  Then in order to steal your donations, an attacker would need to commandeer your domain and get a new SSL cert (or steal your cert and keys) - SSL+DNS gives you two-factor protection.
But it's not easy to use.  In order to receive payments without copying/pasting, you would need to 1. find a bitcoin: url on the target page and click it, and have your wallet program set up to handle bitcoin: url scheme, or 2. enter the https: url to your wallet program and have it load the page and look for the bitcoin in the header.
I guess what I am getting at is, it's not the length of the key that makes it difficult to use, it is the missing integration between the website and the wallet.  Even tinyurl addresses need copying and pasting - they are quite short but still look like passwords and people don't like copying them by hand.  There needs to be some way to extend the trust of an official webpage directly to the wallet with no middleman.

Look, Bitcoin mining *already* solves a real-world problem, and that is "Who will run the servers that back the world-wide decentralized Bitcoin network?"
The answer is, Bitcoin itself pays people to add their machines to the network.  Mining is what makes Bitcoin self-sustaining.
People should stop saying that mining is solving "fake" problems so you can earn "free" coins.  Mining is real actual work of real actual value to every Bitcoin user.

Think of it this way: if you were paid for your work in stock, or airline miles, or moonshine, or bananas, you would still owe taxes on your income (and gains).  
It is not the money that is taxed, it is the income.  If you want to take advantage of BTC being anonymous to avoid paying your taxes, go ahead and take that chance, but you're still guilty of a crime.
In theory you could keep your money in BTC, even if you have doubled your money, you don't actually owe taxes on it until you sell them.  So you could sell a bit at a time when you want to spend.  Count your profits when you sell them to spend.  That's legal.

Some questions you want to think about carefully...
1. Who will form the peers in the network?  If they are mining the coins, are they getting enough to make it worthwhile, or is there some other reason to mine/support the network?
2. Are they going to be spent like money, or are they more like loyalty points, airline miles, etc?  When they are spent, are they traded to someone else to spend again, or do they just disappear?
3. If they are spent like bitcoins and there is no difference in how they are handled, why not just use bitcoins?

The problem with inflation of prices in dollars is that people's wages and debts and other stuff is "locked in" to dollar values, and it is 1. hard to change prices every time dollars lose value and 2. real people are hurt when prices go up and their wages don't.
But it's not clear that this is a problem (yet) for bitcoin... since bitcoin is already so volatile, people already know from the start that the current exchange rate is fluid and they need to check before pulling the trigger on something.  
Right now selling stuff in BTC is rare, but earning wages and holding your retirement or savings in BTC is even more rare.  I think once holding BTC for long term becomes commonplace, prices of everything will naturally stabilize.

Quick explanation: Top chart. line is the avg trade price for that moment in time.  The bars indicate how much was traded during that time window. Tall bars =  lots of trade activity.
Bottom chart is market depth, showing people who want to sell at a higher price, and who want to buy at a lower price.  If the price goes up, people who are "asking" a higher price will make the sale.  If it goes down, people who are "bidding" a lower price will make the buy.

Armory wants the watch-only wallet (online) to generate the transaction which the offline wallet will sign.

The "hash" is a way to validate that the contents are complete and unaltered.  It is similar (in concept) to taking a large list of numbers and adding them all up to get one big number.  If any of the contents are altered, the hash doesn't match.
We add more rules to make the hash even more complicated- like, keep adding different random numbers until we find a block of data that hashes to a nice round number.  The increased "difficulty" ensures that new blocks are not published too quickly--it is adjusted to keep the average around 10 minutes.  The more computers we attach to the problem, the easier it gets -- until the next round when the difficulty goes up and correct blocks become more rare.
"hashes" are very specialized math problem, so it is not currently possible to solve other problems while we're doing hashes.

It takes about 7 weeks for bitcoin miners to produce 173,000 bitcoins.  So if we believe that there is some impact to the rest of the coins by taking these out of circulation, we could estimate the impact as being something like setting back the entire bitcoin economy by 7 weeks.  Or, the impact could be less than that.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:49:06
It's a great idea... just that mining with your home computer is just about dead.  You now need special equipment and even then it may not break even.
But, you could still buy the bitcoins and if they go up in value, set aside 10% of the profits for your favorite charity.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:08:58
"mining" is an inaccurate term, the miners are putting transactions together in a block and signing it with a hash.  The hash becomes more and more difficult when more miners are active, to keep the blocks and the rewards coming at a consistent rate.
bitcoin.org has a great video that explains it. enjoy!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:50:33
No it is not worth it.  There is special hardware available but even that will probably pay for itself once, maybe twice within a year, and then soon stop paying enough to keep up with the costs of power.
The only way to make a profit is to buy the latest hardware and then unload that hardware while it still has some earning potential, and then keep buying the latest equipment.  It's possible but kind of risky.  Mining hardware makers tend to take your money and then not ship your gear for a month or two, which adds to the pain and risk.

The lower graph represents the amount of preorders placed, both for buying and selling.  
There are lots of people who want to sell higher than the current price.  These are called "Ask" because the seller is asking a higher price than anyone is paying right now.  But if the price goes that high, their sales will happen automatically.  Shown in Red because auto-selling tends to slow down the price increases.
Similarly the left side shows "Bids" (buyers who want to buy bitcoin at a lower price than currently available) and when the price falls, they will get their coins.  Shown in Green because when the price falls, preorder bids tend to slow it from falling.
Hover over the line to see how many coins can be bought or sold if the price does get to that level.  For example "263 BTC can be bought until the price goes above 862" -- that means as soon as the buyers outnumber the sellers by 263, the price will go up to that level.

@_date: 2013-12-03 06:53:26
I guess a lot of folks (like this article's author) confuse the mining rewards with the main benefits of the coin itself.  Mining is not "make work" and solving human-readable problems on your cellphone doesn't add much needed infrastructure to the peer-to-peer network.  Mining is an incentive for people to put up *servers* that make up the bitcoin cloud at any given time.  Collecting transactions and hashing them gives ordering and consensus. Unscrambling words on your phone doesn't prop up the coin's network, it actually degrades it instead.
But anyway rewards are not the actual point of the invention.  Sure miners made some money, but we also have cheap hardware as a result and thousands of distributed transaction servers.  And no a mobile phone doesn't count as a server.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:10:41
I actually still have my GPU mining for me, even though I know it will never come close to earning what I spend in additional power.  But it's about 2 cents per day (maybe three cents at the new BTC rates).  So $4 sounds about right.
My goal is to make 0.01 BTC so I can have enough to cash out of the pool (probably will take 90 days or so)... enough to say that I participated.  I can tell my grand-nieces that I mined actual bitcoins... all one-hundredth of a one.
You can check ebay for asic miners and run the numbers through a calculator site.  My estimate is that both the $250 models and the $2500 models would each pay for themselves in about 150 to 200 days, then keep earning for a while... but it's an arms race and they will keep earning less and less until they are burning more power than they earn.  Then you have a scrap machine that doesn't even play games.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:08:59
Most likely the tip is what we call a "paper wallet" because it has both the public (verify) address and the private (spend) address written on it.  You should be able to load that into a wallet program using "Import" and giving the private key.  This won't transfer the money to a new address, it will just make the "key" accessible to your wallet program.  Some programs hide the "Import" option, it should be somewhere in the Receive window or tab.
A "transaction" is how money gets moved from one address to another.  For example if I have 2.64 in my address and I want to pay someone else 1.44, I have to put in the entire 2.64, then specify where it all goes, for example 1.44 to the paper wallet and the rest to some other address in my own wallet, and leaving some extra as fees for whoever processes the transaction.
It is quite confusing at first so feel free to ask questions.

Think a bit about who your audience is for the paper and presentation.  If it is for a CS class, perhaps everyone in the class already knows what a "hash" is and why one-way hashing is important.  If it's for an English or Writing class, you might end up spending most of your time explaining what public/private key encryption is before you get to talk about bitcoins at all.

It is possible to export the keys from one and import into the other, but you have to modify the file by hand.
I created a new key in Multibit and then exported it, just so I could see what import format it was expecting.  I pasted my private key in the file and re-imported it.
So it is possible but depending on your comfort level with editing cryptic text files, spending from one into the other might be easier.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:52:53
Right now yeah it is a bad bet. Lots of people chasing diminished returns.
In the future, rewards drop but transaction fees will still be there.  So I am guessing that whoever wants fast/instant/local access to confirmations and wants to be able to push their own transactions with little or no fee, will be the miners.
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:23:26
I think if it's on a small scale, you could just use your phone.  You could print some paper wallets ahead of time and then photocopy just the load/verify side.  Buyers could each scan their own QR code and keep the paper as a receipt.  Your phone just needs to scan and verify it is loaded with the correct amount.  Keep the original with the private key in a safe place and you can collect from them later.

agreeing with 123felix here... it depends on what you are most comfortable with.
An online wallet says "I mostly trust this site. I know how to use 2-factor authentication and how to disable/recover from it if my phone fails."
A PC wallet says "I am pretty sure my PC is not compromised, or if it is, I realize I may lose my coin.  I understand my wallet program, its encryption, and how to backup and restore my wallet file."
A paper wallet says "I am paranoid about these coins so I will not keep them anywhere near an online computer or phone. I understand rebooting a clean OS and using bitaddress.org, or I'm willing to ask for help from someone I trust. I will keep copies of the paper wallet in a safe place."
An offline wallet says "I understand dual-booting and I'm comfortable enough with installing/booting different OS on my computer.  I like the extra security of offline transactions even though they take at least 15 min to execute correctly.  I understand the backup and restore and have tested it.  I like to have read-only access to watch my coins from my normal OS."
A Trezor wallet says "I'm not willing to dual-boot my system or try to boot Linux, but I still want the security of an offline wallet. I take my coins seriously and I would rather buy a nice device than try to hack a paper or offline solution myself."

If coinbase shows it as completed, there should be a link to the transaction so it can be verified on blockchain.info.  It's possible that it's not confirmed yet, so it would not show up on your actual wallet, but if the transaction is visible, it should come through soon.

If you want a do-it-yourself solution for low volumes, you could print up some "pay slips" which would be single-use paper wallets with just the public key exposed.  The other half of the paper wallet would be kept somewhere safe (like the store owner's computer) and could be imported or even generated 1000 at a time. 
Then when someone wants to pay, the cashier writes how much is to be paid on the slip, hands it to the customer, and the customer pays that address with his phone.  The cashier would scan it again to verify the balance is received safely and then ring it up as being paid in that amount (whatever the exchange rate is at that moment).  
The store owner can sweep out all the coins at any time, and the paper can be kept just to double-check everything later.

One minor difference, most traders will wait for 100 confirmations for generated coins.  Generated coins are created by a special kind of transaction which doesn't exist in the peer-to-peer network and can't be confirmed by other miners.  For example, if you spend your generated coin within a block or two, and your block ends up being stale, those coins don't exist and the spend transactions are in limbo... so it takes 100 confirmations for them to be usable.
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:10:13
Another idea is to buy STUFF with it... think about what you might buy after getting your cash, and see if some of that stuff is for sale for bitcoins.  You probably don't want to spend it all at once, but if you want to spend some of it, you avoid exchange fees if you use the bitcoins to buy stuff from people.

The official software is what most everyone will run, but it's important to note that the network works fine even if someone writes his own program that does the same thing.

Invest only what you don't mind losing.  It's exciting, but it is new and nobody really knows what will happen to it.
The fact that it's going up now (a lot) makes it fun, but also makes it scary as an "investment".  The technology seems safe, but the trading price isn't locked to anything specific in the technology itself.  It could go another 10x higher... or it could go back down to 1% of its current value, especially if new regulations make it harder to trade for other money or goods.

Add to it all day. The public address is reusable.  This works the same way as requesting payments from someone else (you "pay" the paper wallet like you're paying someone else).
The change comes into play when you want to spend your coin. You can send the change back to the same address, but depending on how you did the spending, you should consider your paper wallet "hot" and just sweep the balance into the next paper wallet on the list.

I think if you are saying "Bitcoin going up in value is a temporary distraction" I would agree with that.  
Real Bitcoin believers don't love it because it is going up compared to USD, -- they love it for its potential as a technology for sending money without Western Union/PayPal or whatever.
Merchants don't care how much 1 BTC is worth, they just want to be able to use it to collect local currency in a frictionless way.  So Amazon and Macys will get it as soon as it works as well as Visa for lower fees.  Right now it is still too complex and fragile for "normal" use like a Visa card.

It's interesting... but it's also important to remember that being able to wipe out and restore the device to new is a key feature.
In theory it might be possible to program it with a set of keys which the vendor or retailer keeps a copy.  For example, I'm selling a Trezor device which I have preloaded with 0.01 BTC, but I've also written down everything needed to restore its keys on another device.  So you get your free bitcoins, and I just have to wait for you to use the wallet addresses for some large amount and then sweep them to myself.
If someone DID give me a hardware wallet with BTC already loaded, I would say "Gee thanks!" and then sweep the BTC to my other wallet or a paper wallet, and then reinitialize the device with a new random seed just to be safe.

Another point to consider, if you mine solo you get coins via generation directly (coinbase transaction) but if you mine in a pool, they should then pay you out via a normal transaction.  So in that case you would probably need to wait 17 hrs to cash out, but after that it would look like a normal transaction to your wallet.

I doubt it.  But if you did just get cleaned out could you post the public and private key together so someone could verify it?  Nice name by the way

You seem to be on the right track.  I would also suggest to print a number of paper wallets so that when you have to use one, you can roll the remaining balance into the next one.
Don't ever destroy your data, just keep it locked away on a USB stick or something.  If something goes wrong with your paper (say, water damage if you have an ink jet printer) you will be glad you have a backup.  Small USB sticks are cheap enough, you can even keep it in the file folder with the paper wallets.

Poor man's 2FA, block out the left half of the key and photo copy, then block out the right half of the key and photocopy.  You can store these in two different places and join them when it's time to spend.

I gave up on Armory for now since it didn't work on my main system (Mac).  Instead I did the same thing with Electrum and it seems to be working great-- I have both an online and offline wallet, and the offline wallet has an online watch-only version.  Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:27:50
Yes Armory and Electrum are both good solutions if you want something a bit fancier than a paper wallet.  If you are comfortable booting into ubuntu, you can install Armory and create an offline wallet, then you will have as many private keys as you might need.  As a bonus you can save the private keys to one USB stick and save a "watch only" copy to another USB stick, which can import in your regular desktop computer as a read-only wallet. 
But if you are not really comfortable with Ubuntu, use it for printing the paper wallets and don't bother with the offline wallet.
Print your paper wallets twice... some photocopiers keep a copy of everything copied that day :)  So your IT guy at work or at Kinko's could print a copy for himself if he's really bored.

I really wish someone would take apart the virus and figure out how to make it pay different addresses.

"Change" means: You must account for all the inputs, by sending them either back to the same address, or another address you control.  Depending on the wallet it has different behavior.  See if there are other addresses listed in your wallet.

Here's an idea, since dogtags usually come in pairs, engrave the first half of the private key onto one, and the second half onto the second one.
That means you can separate them to different parts of the house, or to a trusted person's house, and bring them back together when needed to spend.  It also means you could give the engraving task to two different vendors.

Wallets are confusing, but if you have ever set up PGP, it is similar actually.  Your wallet contains public/private key pairs.  The public part you need to give to others if you want them to pay you.  The private part you want to keep secret and safe.
Back up your wallet file to a USB stick or something, hopefully encrypted, and the wallet file on your disk should also be encrypted.
If it's a lot of coins and you want to store them more securely, check out paper wallets.  It is basically a public/private key pair that gets printed out but never stored on your computer (best to print them when your machine is unplugged from the network, maybe even boot from a LiveCD or something that's known to be virus-free).
Yes, if you lose the private keys, you would lose the funds.

I wanted to have an "offline" wallet on a USB stick, which I would only load if booted in Unix, and a corresponding watch-only version of the same wallet.  This is pretty nerdy and power-user... for most people Multibit will work fine and paper wallets are fine for long term storage.

A paper wallet has a single balance at any time, so if you want to only send part of it to someone, you have to split it.  Sending money from one wallet to another is exactly the same as spending it.
The easiest way to send it to someone is to ask them for a receiving address and then pay their address with yours.  You could also just give them the paper or copy the private key, but they are trusting you not to keep a copy for your own spending later.  did that make sense?

The best way to *test* a paper wallet before using it is to sign a message with the private key and verify the message with the public key.  Signing a message is exactly what is happening when you spend the coins, so this is a good test that the crypto works.
Boot your 100% offline computer, or boot your normal computer with a "live cd".  Install Electrum or Armory (Armory has a complete self-contained package for ubuntu that you can download including its dependencies).  Import the private key and use it to sign a short message like "Satoshi Nakamoto" and save the signature.  Then verify the signature using the public key, same short message, and the signature text.  If signature is verified, that means the public key and private key are correctly linked.
Usually it is fine to skip this step but if you want to be paranoid, the technology is available.  You could also test your book of paper wallets by loading 0.001 BTC to the first one on the list and then sweeping it back into your live wallet... if it works, it is highly likely that the rest of the wallets in your stack will work. But don't re-use the test one after you have withdrawn from it.
If you are comfortable installing Linux and having a dual-boot system, it is pretty easy to have an offline wallet with either electrum or armory and keep the private keys 100% private.  In that case, you never need to reveal the private keys, you would only use them to "sign" transactions.
You can keep the offline wallet on a USB stick that won't ever be loaded on a networked computer.  Then on your normal computer you can keep a "read only" or "watch only" version of that wallet.  The watch only wallet can watch those addresses and tell how much money you have, and it can "prepare" transactions which then get "signed" by the offline wallet.

Thanks for taking the time to respond.  You are right, it is pretty different and I don't know if I would want to maintain another online wallet just for that.  I would prefer to load them myself and keep track of them myself, so I can sweep them after some time if they aren't used.

Coinbase: To and from your bank account, you have a BTC balance but no USD balance.
Mt. Gox: You can keep a BTC or USD balance. They don't cash out until you request it.  It is expensive and time-consuming to get cash out of Gox, which it why the coins are so expensive.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:24:10
My guess is that mt. gox keeps track of how much BTC you have with them, but probably doesn't preserve the actual address.  You are going to be buying and selling with them all the time so the address is only important when you add more from outside or when you want to cash out.  Look at your gox account to see if the funds are visible and you should be good.

Good info, I did not know this.  That means you are revealing some extra info about the address when you sign a message.

Right now most of their problems seem to be failed bank transfers, and failure to show what went wrong, so if you buy BTC and your bank refuses the transfer for some reason, it will show up as "failed" after some time.
So far everything I've seen indicates that it usually works fine, and if a buy fails you don't get charged.
They did double-charge me for one purchase but they corrected it before I even noticed any issue.
It is a long lead time, so don't use it for "day-trading" but if you want to buy coins and hold onto them, coinbase is great.

Not a silly question, but it does get asked 2-3 times per day :)  I asked the same thing a while back.
There are some people who do this but it's not a guaranteed profit for a few reasons.  The biggest one is the fee to move dollars out of MtGox, essentially they are charging you more on the way out, while everyone else is charging less, or charging on the way in.  So once you have made your dollars, an expensive wire transfer is the only way out (not ACH or other payment network)

It's more correct to say that the old box gets emptied and Bob gets a new box, and you get a new box for your change as well.  Some versions of the client send the "change" back to the same box.  
After a box is emptied, though, more money could still be added in. Usually this is the case if you have published your pay-me info somewhere.  So it's a good idea to keep the keys to all the boxes you've used in the past, even if they were one-time uses.  Most people only use a box one time, to keep their usage anonymous and unconnected, but it is possible to reuse them by paying them again.
Somewhere in the analogy you want to mention that if you know the address of the box but don't have the key, you can still put money IN.  Maybe they have a one-way flap at the top?

The problem with protecting private keys until it's time to reveal them is, that eventually you have to reveal them, then that address should be considered "hot" because you used the private key somewhere on some connected machine.
Trezor gets around this by using the private key to *sign* a transaction, thus proving you have the key without showing it to anyone else.
If you can work out a way to 1. scan the address of who you want to pay and how much 2. prepare and sign the transaction 3. send the transaction to the blockchain without revealing your private key  THAT would be awesome.  Maybe your electronic wallet could approve the sale and respond with another QR code that the other person scans.
We need to develop more tools that work this way. Trezor works great as long as you have your laptop with you and a wireless connection at all times but we don't yet have truly mobile trezor-like technology.

I was going to say this too.  It's important to know that the miners are rewarded for doing something that the Bitcoin network needs anyway: putting servers online that become the backbone of the network.
People sometimes see miners collecting money and think "Gee that's not fair, let's make some other coin that's more fair, let's let people mine coins in South Africa by playing tic tac toe on their phones"... the trouble with that is now there's no incentive for the miners to build the network.

Nope, it is anonymous.  It could have been a mistake but in that case they would probably have no way to contact you either.

The exchanges provide a valuable service to the companies offering their stock, such as compliance with regulatory oversight.  They have to prove that their officers aren't trading on inside information, for example, so if the exchange is anonymous, publicly-traded companies (at least in the US and any country with something like an SEC) would not be able to use it to raise money and still comply with the law.

I think the best strategy is to identify one client who is able to use bitcoins, and start with that one, or maybe two, as a pilot project.  You will need to set up instructions for them and for your coworkers, carefully, and even then there is a risk something will go wrong and coins will be stuck somewhere for a time.  Pick a customer who is willing to go through the steps carefully and give you feedback on the instructions, etc.
Take some time to think about contingency plans and safety checks.  For example, you could have them pay you 0.0001 coins to verify that the process works before sending a real payment.  Also phone up your bank and ask to speak to the actual manager and tell them you will have payments from bitpay or coinbase or whatever coming in, and make sure they are fine with it... tell them you have a long history with their bank as a business customer but if your payments get blocked in the future you won't hesitate to switch banks immediately.  New checks can be printed but you can't print up new trust in your banker.
Use your test case to identify the risks and barriers to adoption and then give your boss a report on readiness, THEN plan the rollout for all the other customers.

The "hash" is a way to validate that the contents are complete and unaltered.  It is similar (in concept) to taking a large list of numbers and adding them all up to get one big number.  If any of the contents are altered, the hash doesn't match.
We add more rules to make the hash even more complicated- like, keep adding different random numbers until we find a block of data that hashes to a nice round number.  The increased "difficulty" ensures that new blocks are not published too quickly--it is adjusted to keep the average around 10 minutes.  The more computers we attach to the problem, the easier it gets -- until the next round when the difficulty goes up and correct blocks become more rare.
Finally, the "reward" for the miner finding the block is 25 BTC but diminishes as you said.  The expectation is that fees will provide enough incentive after that -- fees are technically optional but miners are free to ignore no-fee transactions and most do.  So as more transactions happen per each 10 min, fees will go up as block rewards go down.  When rewards go to 0 miners will likely keep mining for the transaction fees.  But if miners quit the game, the system still works, the difficulty will just come back down.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:27:56
Also may depend on how full you keep your drive (if it becomes 100% full any old deleted blocks would likely be gone) and how often you like to defragment your drive.

There would be fewer miners but not 0.  As long as there are transactions, someone would want to collect the fees for them.  We need miners but the network would still work fine if there were fewer of them.
Confirmations are important--that is how the nodes reach consensus about how much each address holds.  Third party apps are possible but they would have to plug into the main chain to allow people to spend their coins anywhere they want.  My guess is that financial service providers and most larger vendors would maintain their own stacks of bitcoin servers just to have a place to send their own transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:48:21
I agree, paper wallets are sufficient for most folks.
There is a way to have a fully "offline" wallet using Armory or Electrum but it involves having an offline computer, or installing another OS on an external drive, or similar.

If it is in question, you can use your private key to sign a message.  The person you are paying can verify that the message was signed by the holder of the address.  They just need to know the address of the sender (which is already connected to the payment) to validate the signature.  The encrypt and sign features work just like PGP.

You could install Linux to another partition, or even install Mac OS to another partition or another hard drive entirely.
I think with some effort you can boot your mac from a USB stick directly using a linux live-image or similar.  Then the entire OS is on a stick and you can remove it from the computer.
By far the most important thing is to keep the new private wallet off the main drive and in some storage that is not readable by your main online OS.  In my mind there is little difference whether the offline OS is on another partition or what... that is more ease of use and less chance of losing data due to unfamiliar patterns.
I don't like Windows because of personal taste and generally more compromises available, so personally I would go with a second Mac OS install or a linux install, but take your own comfort level with each into account.

Yes, this too.  The bitcoin foundation and its authors have the influence, but miners actually control the network.  If enough miners disagree with the change, it won't get control of enough hardware, and the network will treat the new software as the intruder/spammer.
Also if enough miners want a change, it can go through even without bitcoin's official authors approving it.  It's unlikely, but if their money is at stake you can bet they would do it.

It can overheat if you try to override the speed and overclock it.  If you do overclock, make sure you have good temp control and test it.

Though I think anyone whose money was stolen could also report it, whether TradeFortress wants it reported.  Bitcoin might be anonymous, but if he had a domain name, at very least the police could find him and get more details.  If he is blameless the police would need to clear him.
I think anyone who lost coins can and should report it to their local police or state/country computer crimes unit.  You don't need to know the "correct" jurisdiction... the police can work it out among themselves.

@_date: 2013-12-17 04:27:20
OK there is actually one way to really test if a private key works, and is connected to an address.  This will test if you have recorded the private key correctly.
1. Save a copy of bitaddress.org on your USB stick.
2. Boot to some offline OS like Ubuntu Live CD.
3. Load up the saved copy of bitaddress.org and go to Wallet details tab.
4. Enter your private key there carefully.  Check if the address displayed matches your real address.  Now is a great time to copy the address and save it on the USB stick, but don't save the private key until you're ready to spend it.
If you need even more assurance that the private key and address are mathematically, cryptographically linked, you can go the extra step of signing a message using the private key and verifying it with your public key.  
1. Use the above steps to boot Ubuntu or any offline-only OS.
2. Install Armory, or Electrum, or any wallet program you like.
3. Import your private key into the offline wallet. (Don't worry, you will not be saving this wallet file anywhere.)
4. Use the "Sign Message" feature to write a short message like "Satoshi Nakamoto" and sign it with your private key.
5. Copy the signature and go to the Verify Signature option.  Enter the same short message, the public key, the signature, and hit Verify.
"Sign a message" is exactly what happens when you spend the coins, only the short message you are signing is the transaction itself.  Signing and verifying the message takes some effort, especially with an offline wallet, but it is 100% verification that you are in control of the private key.
If you like you can use your private keys in offline mode to sign short messages and save the signatures.  When I generate offline addresses, I keep the private keys on one stick, and I save the public keys and signatures on another stick.  Then I can copy the address to a watch-only wallet and also verify signatures to make sure I have copied them correctly.  Lots of effort for &lt;1 btc but I would definitely do it for &gt;10 btc

Short answer: Most of them charge you on the way in, MtGox charges you on the way out.  So their prices appear higher but once you get your USD or other currency, you have to pay extra to get it out, or buy back into bitcoins at their higher price.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:42:29
But, the software to do this is not out there.  Most wallets won't do it, so you have to have a special site do it for you or write your own tool.  As better software and more tools come along, this will be improved.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:07:49
I think the most important lesson is don't do preorders... if they had only been able to charge folks when the shipment was made, they would have shipped faster or gone out of business quickly.

Yes, this.  The miners essentially are the network.  And they will be split between those who want to mine more coins, and those that want their already-mined coins to hold their value.  Most of them know that if more coins are produced, the whole economy would get watered down.
The official software is what most everyone will run, but it's important to note that the network works fine even if someone writes his own program that does the same thing.  Anyone is free to modify the code and run it, or rewrite their own.  The rest of the network has to validate whether the transactions and blocks being produced are correct, per the rules, and if they are, it doesn't matter what software or hardware produced them.

In my multibit I'm pretty sure there was no address there in Send until I pasted one.  Look in the section below "Addresses to send bitcoin to" and see if there are any in the list.  
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:18:20
Usually it does.  The best way to hack into someone's multibit wallet is to already be logged on to their machine by some virus, trojan or rootkit.  Multibit won't send your private key over the network, it will just "sign" transactions whenever you want to spend.  So you are usually protected from snooping over the wire but it doesn't help if the attacker already has access to your machine from the inside.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:15:37

Right.  The big question is this: If it is combined with 1000 other valid deposits, and then the whole pile gets split up again 1000 ways, which person has to give it back?  There's no easy answer to that.
If you can prove that some coins were stolen a month ago, there may be a million times that much in downstream transactions.  It will be impossible to show a specific coin was stolen once it hits the exchange.

I think depositing cash to someone else's account (via localbitcoins.com)  should be as secure as you can get it.  You are trusting localbitcoins.com to have the coins in escrow and release them to you.  The seller can delay the process but they would probably check and release them to you at the agreed price even so.

You can do this check yourself by using the private key to sign a short message, and then using the public key in the other program to verify the signature.

has lots of great answers to this every day.  But short answer is no, even if you could power up just the GPU card itself it would not generate enough BTC to pay for the power.
If you buy the latest ASIC and get it shipped to you immediately, you could probably earn back what you paid within 150 days.  Then it might pay for itself over again 1 to 3 times in the following year, but soon it would stop paying for itself and become a costly space heater.  ASICs are kind of an arms race right now.

You don't actually need a "paper" wallet to do this.  You could use a new unique address for every transaction, and just supply the machine with a long list of public keys.
The machine can show the QR code and verify it was paid, all without using or knowing the private key.  But, it does require a network connection to verify payment at sale time.  At the end of the day you can create one transaction to sweep all the payments to one address, if you want.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:11:23

For 2: people often forget that bitcoin addresses can also be used to encrypt and sign messages just like PGP.  So if I want to be sure I am paying the right address, I would ask them to sign a message with their private key, and I can verify it with their public key. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:38:29
Don't use bitcoin-QT, I would suggest Electrum for this.  You can even have read-only wallets on one machine and the full keys on another machine, as well as simple paper backups.  Something like 12 key words can be used to recover your wallet completely.  Good luck

As to the "anti-state" folks, I think there are a lot of Libertarians who are pro-bitcoin but most Libertarians are not really anti-state, like anarchists might be.
The way I read it, Libertarians approve of government, as long as the role of government is limited to protecting people and protecting property rights.  In that sense they may actually be more pro-establishment than bitcoin itself :)
I think the true Libertarian would say that you're free to set up a business to hold someone else's coins for them, and if you cheat your customers the law should deal with you.  (I'm not one so I may be misunderstanding their position)

I suggest this one is backwards... the coins being worth more is an incentive for more miners to get in the game, or to turn mining rigs on that had previously become unprofitable to run.  But there is no direct connection I can see going the other way: the cost of mining doesn't immediately drive up the price of the coins.
Bitcoin doesn't have a tangible physical thing that determines its value, just the weight of the fingers clicking on "buy" or "sell" at any point in time.

They get mining rewards which go down over time, but they also get transaction fees from each transaction, which would stay the same or become more.  The mining rewards go down gradually so the miners will naturally start getting less and relying more on transactions.
If miners do leave the business, not a huge deal, just the difficulty would go down as more equipment gets turned off.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:43:15
Yes.  The wallet password encrypts the file when you save it, so if someone else gets the wallet file, they have to guess the password from the time it was last opened/saved.  You can change your password at home but it doesn't change the password on the lost copy.  
If a copy of your wallet file gets released into the wild, best thing to do is move all the coins quickly to another new wallet generated with new addresses.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:46:16
First important point: Your account number is secret, but you can reveal PART of your account number to others.  They can pay you but not spend your money.
Second important point: Lots of computers around the world are busy chatting and comparing and validating transactions.  Every 10 minutes they publish a new update to the ledger which contains all account balances ever.
Third important point: There's no central control, so anyone with a computer can elect to be part of the system.  Every "block" (every 10 min) pays the one who successfully encoded it by creating new Bitcoins in his account.

The first one seems to be a special case because "0" is a special number.  Coins can be sent to the "0" address but can never be recovered because there is no matching private key mathematically.
The others do seem to match left to right but are all blank, and a couple are drained.  So I guess if you use "1" or "10" as your magic number you had better get your coins back out quickly.

There is actually a way to sign a message using your private key, and then verify the signature with the public key.
When generating the paper wallets (can be saved on paper or saved on a USB stick) you can use each paper wallet to sign a short message, such as your name, or "Satoshi Nakamoto".  
If you use a USB stick, save the private keys to one stick, and the public key and signature to another stick.  Then you can import the public keys to an online wallet, for watching or sending.  Most wallet programs will allow you to verify a signed message, so you will have mathematical proof that the private key matches the public key, without entering the private key anywhere.
The public/private keys are similar to PGP, you can use them to sign/verify or encrypt/decrypt messages, without sending any money.

I don't think there's any reason to assume the market cap "has to be" any specific amount.  But I also don't think bitcoin is going to replace all money everywhere... I think it will continue to be a companion to government-issued money, like a foreign currency only it's foreign to all governments.
If bitcoin becomes stable and popular as an actual currency, most of its users will be spending it, not speculating its value.
The most wildly successful thing we could probably imagine would be if some countries decide to peg their own currency to BTC so that the trading rate becomes constant.  Then it would be something like the euro is now.  The euro is huge but I don't think it really helped wealth to change hands.

I think this is a symptom of a much larger issue, which is that BTC value is very volatile compared to absolutely everything else in the world.

I don't know why it would be different from taxing a foreign currency.  If you trade your dollars for euros and buy stuff with it, you haven't gained anything.  But if you buy low and sell high and end up with more dollars, that is called capital gains, whether you are buying and selling bitcoin, euros, pork bellies, or whatever.
I don't think it's quite true to say there is no way to find bitcoin tax evaders.  I think they will be found the old fashioned way, when they trade back to dollars or when they buy cars and homes worth 100x their claimed salaries.

More info from their site
You can often diagnose a problem with MultiBit by looking at the Messages window by selecting the 'View | Messages Messages' menu option.
For a more detailed description of what has happened with MultiBit there is a log file to look at. This is stored in the 'log' directory in your user data directory and is called 'multibit.log'. Use a simple text viewer like Notepad or TextEdit to read it.
Where MultiBit stores your data
MultiBit stores user specific data such as logs and the default multibit.wallet in a "user data directory". This directory can be worked out as follows:
    Check the the very top of the "Messages" tab for a message like "The user data directory is 'xxxxx'"
    Navigate to the MultiBit installation directory and check for a file called "multibit.properties". If there is, use this directory as the user data directory. This is for backwards compatibility and for running everything from a USB drive.
    If none of these reveal the answer, use the technical approach given below.
Technical approach
This section is for technical users proficient with accessing environment variables. These are enclosed in "[]" such that [APPDATA] references the APPDATA environment variable.
Try one of the following locations, remembering that you may need to enable hidden directories
    [APPDATA]/MultiBit. Windows (7,8): C:\Documents and Settings\jim\AppData\Roaming\MultiBit
    [APPDATA]/MultiBit. Windows (XP and below): C:\Documents and Settings\jim\Application Data\MultiBit

Almost there.  Blocks are built on top of other blocks.  Two miners could come up with a solution, but they are different solutions because the "Pay me 25" transaction is different in each case.  The "winner" is whichever one the other miners start building onto.  
In some cases, a perfectly valid block is published at the same time as another valid block.  They are both as valid as the other, and in theory each one could start its own "version" of the chain, but in practice the NEXT block will get built soon enough and everyone will converge on that one.  This is why some mining pools will show "orphaned" blocks - they are valid but not picked up by the other miners, so their reward doesn't become official.
For this reason, normal transactions are considered "confirmed" after 6 new blocks, but mining rewards aren't usually accepted for spending until 100 blocks later.

Try this variation.
1. Buyer and seller agree to a transaction expressed by a plaintext sentence.  (For example, a bill of sale)
2. Seller (payee) signs the agreement and gives the signature and address, buyer verifies.
3. Buyer pays seller, using the given address.
4. Buyer signs the same agreement and gives the signature and address, seller verifies. (If the payment came from multiple addresses, use any of them, but signature must confirm that at least one of the addresses is controlled by buyer/payer)
5. Either party can verify the payment using the blockchain.  Both parties have copies of the signed agreement.
I don't see why either party should need to generate new addresses... the address used to pay can be used to sign the agreement too.
In some cases the sender will have money in multiple addresses, and the wallet software may make it difficult to control which source is used for payment.  So buyer can pay first and then sign the agreement using the same key.  
Both parties have evidence that the payment came to and from the correct address.

The reason certain "extensions" are needed to see .bit domains is that .bit doesn't actually exist on the real Internet.  There is a way to register new top-level domains (TLD) with the internet standards org ICANN, but Namecoin/.bit owners haven't done it successfully.  Until then .bit will not be ready for prime time.
I am not sure if they tried and failed, or if they are taking a "screw you ICANN" approach.  Maybe a bit of both.
Making up your own new toplevel domain and selling names on it is like selling "real estate" that is in the air above someone else's land.  Nobody should pay real money for .bit domains until they get it hooked up to the real internet.

Right now there aren't great tools to create multi-signature addresses or multi-signature transactions.  That should be made more accessible.
I like the idea of Trezor -- for a wallet to be really secure, it needs to be able to hold your keys and only communicate with the world by signing transactions, and maybe signing messages.  The times we have to copy and share our private keys are too many and too risky.  People have enough trouble keeping their email passwords safe... There should be better wallets that work without exposing the private keys to the user so they are not in danger of copying them out except as a secure backup.

You can earn pennies a day using your graphics card. The only problem is you use more power (even more than leaving your computer on all the time) and you're spending more in power than you are earning in coins.
If you are stubborn and want to do it anyway (like me) you can mine with your graphics card until you get enough to cash out and then you can say you participated in the revolution.  You are correct, pools will pay based on the fraction of hashing power you have compared to the whole.
Find one that lets you cash out a small amount. BitMinter wants me to have at least 0.01 BTC to cash out which will take something like 75 days at my current speed.  So I can earn $10 in BTC in 75 days and will probably pay $35 in power.  Some deal.

Look for an "export" option in the Receive window.  That will save the private key to a text file.
I was able to export mine from Bitcoin-QT and import them into Multibit.  I had to create a new key in Multibit and export that too, just so I could see the format of the text file it was expecting.  I replaced the private key in that file with the Bitcoin-QT key and reimported it to Multibit.
Once you discover the Private key you don't have to reimport it to Multibit, you can probably take it to any other wallet like blockchain.info too

For what hardware, think about what computer you want to leave on all the time.  If it's the iMac maybe you can find a way to put the screen to sleep.  Make sure there is enough air circulation around the miner stick -- if it gets really hot to the touch it will degrade its lifetime quickly.
For software, bitminter app works but you are stuck with their pool.  If you have a few hours to spend, go and install BFGminer.

About syncing, bitcoin-QT takes a long time to sync but there are other clients that do this faster.  
Keep in  mind that they are syncing with the global transaction ledger but the two wallets won't have any connection to each other unless you export the keys from one and import them into the other (or just transfer the money as you would when paying someone).  Right now the two wallets are independent and they have no way to connect.

I only checked the first 10 or so. 
1 was clearly a fake private key printed next to a real public key, so already we know something is fake. (Bitaddress.org can be used to put the private key and verify if it leads to a public key)
1 has some transactions but a 0 balance, so probably it is a compromised key that got published somewhere, it was cleaned out in June.
The others I checked all had 0 transactions, meaning they were probably valid public keys that have never been used anywhere.  Any wallet program can be used to generate hundreds of these, so this is not scary.

They are intended to be single-use for privacy reasons.  You can keep using the same address but you are exposing more data about yourself that could be used to profile you or whatever.
In the original paper, Satoshi Nakamoto recommended to keep all your address/key pairs and never throw them away.  Someone could send money to your old addresses, or you might someday need to use the digital signature feature to prove you are the owner--for example,if you paid someone and they dispute it, saying the payment came from someone else, you can use digital signing to prove you are the owner of the address.

It is a good question, and the answers are not clear without many hours of research.  
It's important to note also that there's no way to force everyone on the network to run the same software.  So anyone could modify the software and run their own version of it.  The security has to extend to the protocol layer so that bad transactions would be ignored (like reversing your own spends, or spending someone else's coins without the key).
I understand the basics of it, but not well enough to declare it trustworthy all on my own.  At this point I'm trusting it based on many people smarter than me who are looking at it and verifying it independently.
But, bugs have happened before and fixes have been rolled out to address issues.  It's going to always be improving but that doesn't mean it's guaranteed bulletproof.

I understand what you're saying... but here's another way to think of it.  Credit cards are based on a certain amount of trust, you have to trust the merchant, the merchant has to trust you, and you both have to trust Visa.  When something goes wrong they try to make it right (and usually it is the merchant that gets screwed, the customer is in for some hassle but will usually get all his money back).
On the other hand, Bank of Bitcoin is based on complete lack of trust.  You can trade bitcoins with someone you trust, and you can fairly safely trade them with someone you don't trust at all.

It does not need to be completely offline.  The keys are not sent... it can only "sign" transactions and messages.  The private keys never leave the device even if it is plugged in.
Take a look at the intro video, it is pretty slick.  It is similar to Armory in "offline" mode in that you prepare a transaction and then Trezor signs it to approve it.  But it does require special software on the host... the computer doesn't see it as just a wallet file.  It needs a special API.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:45:50
Looks like it is similar to how wallet programs generate new addresses.  The key difference is that it's using the page number as the random seed.  Usually you would make up your own random seed by moving your mouse around or using 12 random words.  So this site is generating usable keys 100 at a time, but your chance of stumbling onto a page number that has someone else's keys on it already are tiny.
The confusing part is the actual activity around the first two... I guess using 0 or 1 as your private key is like having an empty password.

Coinbase is pretty safe as long as you have 2-factor authentication.  With coinbase the real risk is that their site may have problems at the moment you want to spend.  So you might want to have a small amount in your other wallet.
If you don't trust coinbase, paper wallets are safe as long as you generate them offline.
The way to transfer coins from one wallet to another is the same as paying someone else.  In coinbase you would click "Send" and give it the Receive address from electrum.

It is like a foreign currency.  In that sense it is not new.  If you buy some foreign currency and sell it later at a profit, you still have to get the money back either in cash or in your bank.

I think if they can catch Al Capone they can catch today's tax evaders.  Sure, some will slip through the cracks and small gains will go unnoticed.

Don't forget about "change" -- look carefully at the transaction where you sold a few for $20 each and see if the original address was drained at that time. Some wallet clients send the "change" back to the same address, but some generate a new address for the change.  Restoring your wallet from a backup could make it forget the change address, so check all the copies of the wallet file you can find.

Two USB sticks are probably fine.  Keeping it on google drive is probably OK but not as safe as keeping the USBs offline.  For small amounts I currently keep an encrypted wallet on Dropbox but I would not do that for a large amount.
Keep in mind that when you use the wallet, it may generate new addresses (for change, etc.) so the backup may not have access to all the money.  I think you can pre-generate a hundred or so addresses.. just verify that the pre-generated addresses are getting used for the "change" transactions and it's not creating new ones.  If it creates new addresses, you have to recopy the wallet to the other usb stick too.
If it is a lot, use a totally offline wallet, or paper wallet, or a usb stick and paper backup.  You can boot your computer from a live CD, create all the keys, print them as paper wallets and save them to the USB stick.  Keep the usb stick and one copy of the paper in a safe location.  You can block the private codes and just make a copy of the public codes, and use that for sending money into the wallet... you then only need the private key when you want the funds back out.

Change addresses, most likely.  When you create a transaction, you basically have to account for the entire input and channel some of it to the intended recipient, and the rest goes back to you, into one of your "change" addresses.  Any difference between the inputs and outputs will be kept as a fee by the miner, so it is important to capture this change.
If your transaction was not confirmed, you cannot spend any more until the change comes back to you (I think it requires at least one confirmation)

.bit currently has a problem, which is that it's not a real top level domain.  It's basically an agreement by some users and some network admins to make an exception for .bit and look them up in a special way.
This is the domain-name equivalent of selling real estate that is suspended in the air above someone else's land.  There's no road leading there yet.  They need to solve that problem before .bit becomes mainstream.

Best practice is to deposit into paper as many times as you want, but only spend from it once.  Load the entire thing to your PC wallet, spend what you need, then pay the remainder back to a NEW paper wallet for safe keeping.
You can print 10 or 20 paper wallets as easily as one.  But once you reveal the private address to anyone, consider it "hot" and may be compromised.  Don't ever throw them away though.

I gave up on Armory for now since it didn't work on my main system (Mac).  
I decided to use Electrum for my "offline" wallet, and used this tutorial here.
You can keep the offline wallet on a USB stick that won't ever be loaded on a networked computer.  Then on your normal computer you can keep a "read only" or "watch only" version of that wallet.  The watch only wallet can watch those addresses and tell how much money you have, and it can "prepare" transactions which then get "signed" by the offline wallet.
It seems to be working great-- I have both an online and offline wallet, and the offline wallet has an online watch-only version.  
So now I have a USB stick with the private/offline wallet, which I plan to only open with Ubuntu, and a "watch only" version of the wallet for my Mac.  My Mac also has a smaller amount in a fully online wallet (which I can spend without booting to another OS)
When I launch Electrum it always opens the "default_wallet" file but you can close it and open the one from the stick if you want.  But if it's a watch-only wallet then you can store it on the HD or wherever you want. 
Good luck.

Actually electrum/armory is probably fine too.  I think electrum seems a bit better if you want to code something in python, maybe they are the same but electrum seems to have better docs.
Revealing one private key to one receiver won't give them enough to unwind back to the master secret.  It's up to you whether to keep the original seed or destroy it once you export all the keys.
For that matter, a combination of bitaddress.org and some wallet like electrum would be fine too, just depends on what you feel comfortable coding.

I think some of them are "real" addresses, but so far either they have 0 balance for some time, or the private key listed next to it is fake.
If you find one with a balance and the correct private key is listed next to it, you could in theory load it in your wallet and transfer the coins to yourself.  
The ethical thing to do in that case would be to attach a note saying "I have your coins, they are safe, contact me at this address to get them back" :)

There were actually many developers besides Satoshi, many of them using real names.
It is actually pretty normal for a small group of developers to look over all the code from all the contributors.
But, here is something else to consider.  A lot of people trust the code and run the code, but it's important to remember that even if somebody modifies the code on their box, the whole system still works.  Every node is checking the correctness of transactions from every other node.  So it is theoretically possible to write your own Bitcoin server from scratch, as long as it follows the same "rules of the road" - the system would still work fine in that case.

This is true, but if you want to keep using the same address over and over, you want to be really careful where the private key gets revealed.
For example, paper wallets are really secure, until the first tine you spend from them.  Then they are only as secure as your wallet program you import them into.
Best security for addresses that you want to keep using over and over would be to keep them in an offline secure wallet with Electrum or Armory, because that allows you to authorize single transactions without revealing the private key.  
Electrum how-to:

This is overly simplified, but let's say there's a math problem with two prime numbers like 3 * 13 = 39.  The public key and address are based on the larger number (in this case 39) and the "secret" is based on knowing the two primes.  And since they are primes, there is only one combination that leads to 39.  (40 would not work because it is 2*20, 4*10, 8*5, but 39 has only two possible factors).  So if you find a matching public key, you know you have found the matching private key as well.

Also, when you first created the wallet, it might have steered you to create it in dir C:\Users\Axel\AppData\Roaming but I think it's also possible to create it elsewhere.

Short version: there are probably three big ideas that make up bitcoin.
Public key cryptography. If you have used PGP you understand this already. I know a secret, and I can prove I know it, without actually showing it to you, because math.
Peer-to-peer network. When you want to make a transaction, you compose a message and sign it using crypto, and send it out to the network. Within a minute all Bitcoin nodes can see it.
Public ledger. The "blockchain" is a list of every transaction ever made with bitcoin, and every node on the network has a copy. They all read it and index it so they know the balance for every address (like account).
"Mining" means confirming new blocks with a hash. Every node in the network competes to be the first to confirm the unconfirmed transactions. We need more servers to form the network, so we give them incentive to volunteer up their hardware and internet connection by rewarding them with bitcoins. But as more miners compete, the difficulty of the problem adjusts so that new solutions are coming about every 10 minutes. The "block" comes with all the recent transactions, one new transaction to pay the miner himself, a copy of the hash from the previous block. And it gets a random number added to it to change the hash result -- miners have to try different random values to get the new hash to be in the correct range. If miners drop out of the game, the hash difficulty in the future might fall again.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:42:59
You are right... it is a barrier for a lot of people. Programmers need to do a better job at creating great tools for people.  User Interface designers and document/help writers need to write great UI and docs so that people can tell what's going on and get guided to do things the right way.
For example, trezor, paper wallets, offline electrum/armory wallets are all great technologies but they each have a high barrier... it is not as simple as downloading an app and installing it.
Online wallets should keep you from having more than $100 if you have not enabled 2-factor auth.

Yes I think we could do something with multi-signature transactions, or multi-signature addresses, more than we are doing now.  Perhaps I could lock down my money with my key AND a third party key so that two transactions from two different devices would be needed to spend.  Something like 2-factor auth but built into the address itself.

Before the first confirmation, your transaction is shared to all the nodes and miners can decide whether to add it to the next block they are working on.  Mostly it happens right away, but if there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions, more than the block can hold, you could be waiting a bit.  Especially if you requested a "free" transaction (no fee).
After the first confirmation, it is no longer about you. Your transaction is there in the block chain.  Your transaction won't be reversed unless the entire block is rejected.  This is uncommon but can happen when two miners generate solutions at the same time.  The winner in that case is whichever one gets more built onto it, so the longest chain always wins.  Even if that block is stale or orphaned, it's likely the "winning" block or next one after would have your transaction anyway.
So a long delay after 1 confirmation means either everyone in the world is waiting for the next block (should be 10 minutes but sometimes it takes longer), or that it is really confirmed but your wallet has not synchronized with the rest of the bitcoin network for some reason.

I use Multibit and I have been happy.  This is just for the wallet.
For mining, I use bfgminer.  It is tricky to install but get a walkthrough and do it and you will be happy.  I also open a terminal and run "screen" before running bfgminer, so that I can close the terminal window and it keeps going (but you do have to stay logged in).  Warning, mining with your GPU is not profitable, and you will pay 10x to your power company compared to just buying the coins.

@_date: 2013-12-07 06:03:18
I see where you're going with the question but, here is what is wrong.  The public address and the private key are generated offline, and your wallet doesn't get the magic number from the network... it is 100% made up by the wallet.  It is either 100% random, or it is derived from the "seed" info like a passphrase or starting key.
It's like going to a bank and getting to choose your own account number.  Choose a good one because if someone else guesses the same number, they can immediately withdraw your money.  But every time you go back to the bank, you have to supply the same number.
In fact the private key doesn't ever enter the block chain or get communicated around by the bitcoin miners or clients.  Your wallet keeps the private number private, and when it comes time to spend, your wallet "signs" the transaction which proves that you know the magic key without revealing the magic key itself.  For best results your wallet should keep the private key hidden from view and you shouldn't need to copy it unless you're moving it to a different wallet program.
Did that make sense?  Yes it is all very new and weird, so it's OK to ask questions.

To answer your other question, there are other wallets that allow you to enter "watch only" addresses which can track your paper wallets without making them spendable.  Multibit doesn't have this feature but some others do.

I think there were some earlier threads about B of A blocking coinbase transactions.  I don't have any direct experience or info other than remembering some posts.
My thinking was that Coinbase may have stopped ACH transactions with B of A for a while, or B of A may have told them to stop.  If the ACH transaction goes through, there is still a chance it might be disputed or reversed later... if this happened before with B of A, a lot, then coinbase might have proactively stopped them so they don't have to deal with reversals later.
But, coinbase really needs to do a better job of communicating what is going on.  This is all just speculation on my part.

I think it will stabilize over time but you are right, no merchant is going to set a price in BTC and ignore what's happening with the dollars.  They have to pay their employers, suppliers, landlords and tax collectors in dollars.
I predict that Bitcoin will be a way to move money electronically and will compete with money orders, Western Union, wire transfers etc. starting right now.  But I also think that it will not replace dollars for normal day to day spending any time soon.  It's like a foreign currency now, foreign to everyone and local to none.

One approach might be to ask your friend to create an account for you on his computer.  That way you can log him out, log in as yourself, and have your own data and settings.
But you would still have to trust your friend and be confident that your friends computer is not infected or compromised.
Armory and Electrum are good offline wallets that you can load as "watching only" on your online PC.  Then you can use the offline wallet to sign/finalize transactions without revealing the private keys (you won't even see them yourself).  This is very high security but requires booting your computer to a new OS to actually spend.  If you're not comfortable booting to a second OS you can use paper wallets as the "offline" or cold storage

I wonder if you could set it up as a game where everyone in the room has to agree which account has which balance?  Put people in groups of 4 to see if they come up with the same answer.  You could give each group the same stack of card and even include some fake transactions that should be denied.

What is Bitcoin?
A type of currency, a global ledger, and a payment network all in one.
Transfers are immediate (optional confirmation in 10-20 min)
No merchant fees (small fee paid by sender)
Based on cryptography (similar to PGP email, but for money)
No chargebacks ever (transactions are irreversible by design)
No government or corporate control  (peer-to-peer network similar to file sharing)
Something like that?

I want to print paper wallets easily.  I want to be able to bring some images on a USB stick and have them print with the paper wallets.  
I would like to also be able to generate some public/private key pairs to store on a USB stick, like paper wallets but not printed.  One stick should have the public and private keys both (CSV file maybe) and one stick would have just the public keys.  These I can import into a wallet as if they are other peoples addresses, so I can quickly "pay into" my paper wallets.
If I use both of these features together, I would end up with a bunch of printed paper wallets, a USB stick that "backs up" my paper wallets in case they are destroyed, and another stick that contains just the public keys of them so I can load them from anywhere.  Prompt me for a starting sequence number so that each key can have an easy human-readable number (similar to a check number).
If I am generating some paper wallets, or some public/private keypairs on USB stick, I would like to have some reassurance that the private key is correct.  The best way I can think of to verify the correctness of a paper wallet, before loading it with coins, is to verify its signature.  That means I can give it a short message (like my real name, or "Satoshi Nakamoto") and in the public keys list, you can give the short message and the signature.  If it's being loaded with more than a few coins, I will want to verify the paper wallet in some way.  Before loading the paper wallet, I will have additional reassurance that the private key really connects to that public key, if the message signature matches.

Another thought in response.  Bitcoin works fine with no trust, but it works fine *with* trust too.  So you can trade with people you don't trust, but you can also develop trust so you can offer more services and make the interface easier.  
And people who abuse the trust they are given, or deliberately try to cheat others, should still be subject to the law.  If someone steals your bitcoins, report them to the police!  If they are caught they will be just as guilty.

When you pick keys, you either supply some randomness (like rolling dice, or moving your mouse around) or the computer supplies some randomness for you.  But with a brain wallet you supply some carefully chosen words and those are used as the "seed" instead of actual randomness.  This means you can re-generate the entire wallet by supplying the same words, but if someone else comes up with the same words, you would both be controlling the same wallet.

I'm a fan of Linux Live Boot CDs, ubuntu has a good one.  If you can boot into Linux without using your HD then you can always recover your coins even if your main HD crashes.
Once you boot to Linux, put in your USB stick where you downloaded bitaddress.org and use that to save the keys.  Since your HDD is not active, and the Live CD you boot from is read-only, only the usb stick has the keys.  Generate a bunch of private/public key pairs and save them to the usb stick.
For extra credit you can put in a second USB stick and save only the public keys.  That means you can import them in your main OS to load as "watch only" without revealing the private key.
If you are a total nerd, you can use each private key to sign a short message, like "Satoshi Nakamoto".  The signed message proves you have access to the private key without revealing it.  You can use this as extra verification that the public key is right and matches the private key without revealing the private key.
USB stick1: Private and public keys, keep safe until spending time.
USB stick2: Public keys only, and optional short message with signature if you want total paranoid checking.

Yes, miners get them.  Over time the new-block reward becomes 0 but transactions keep coming.  It is possible to send a transaction with 0 fees but miners are free to ignore the transaction in that case.
Miners do serve an important function by validating the transactions and communicating consensus, and the miners form the decentralized cloud that is the backbone of the system.

bitcoinarmory.com has a good walkthrough on how to install Armory on Ubuntu.  You will need to download a bunch of files and use the command line (Terminal) to install them.
You can save the Armory wallet to one stick that will have the full wallet, and another stick that has just a watch-only version of the keys.  Then on your main/normal system, load the watch-only wallet so you can view the coins but not spend them.
You will also want to practice sending a small amount to your offline wallet (and use the watch-only wallet to verify it is there).  Then practice sending it back to your normal wallet.  That means preparing the transaction on your normal machine, saving it, and booting ubuntu again to sign the transaction.  Unlike a paper wallet, the private key doesn't get revealed... you can sign a transaction and send it without revealing your private key. 
The offline wallet doesn't know your balance, but the matching watch-only wallet does, and can be used to generate the transaction.  You reboot with Ubuntu to sign, then back into Windows to send it.
If you don't want to install Ubuntu, you can boot and "try" from the Live CD each time.  That means you also have to install Armory each time. But you only need to generate the wallet once. 
Give yourself plenty of time to complete the practice steps. You may get stuck a few times so it's OK to walk away from it and resume later.  Don't do it if you have a deadline.  If you're not comfortable with all that, it's OK to stick to paper wallets.

Sorry, didn't see your reply until just now.  In theory that is correct, but try it out a few times to make sure you get the same keys.  
I'm afraid to use only a seed phrase since there's a chance I will forget the words.  If I write them down, there is less danger of forgetting them, but then it's available to someone who finds the paper.
I think the most secure thing would be to split the passphrase into two parts and hide the two parts in different places.  In that case it could be a brain-wallet type of passphrase, or just the left side and right side of the private keys.
Good luck.

Or multiple buyers, if they're selling a lot :)  And by that I mean, there are a lot of people who decided to get out of the bitcoin business entirely today, so a lot of people want to sell.  And they aren't being met on the other side by an equal number of people who are picking today to increase their holdings.  
If you want to take your money back out, you have to wait for someone to bring money into the room, or settle for a lot less, which seems to be what they are doing in considerable numbers.

I think these are the important points.
What is the blockchain and why is it important? (Like a global distributed ledger)
Public/private key pairs are like account numbers and keys
Distributed network, peer-to-peer, to distribute and confirm transactions (miners)
New coins reward the miners during the start up phase. Over time the transaction fees will replace mining rewards.

You are getting there.  Each address is a mini-account that can have transactions and a balance.  The address acts like a public account number, and there is a corresponding private code that "unlocks" it -- this part is similar to PGP for mail.
Because you will end up using dozens and maybe hundreds of addresses, your wallet program will keep them all in wallet.dat for you.  Keep your wallet.dat safe and secret, back it up, encrypt it.

Uh, no.  You are wrong.  Bitcoin is not anti-government at all, it is merely expressing an idea that you CAN have money without government issuing it.
I am pro-bitcoin and I'm definitely not Libertarian.  Buying/mining/promoting bitcoins doesn't support any Libertarian cause.
There seems to be a lot of loudmouth "KILL ALL THE BANKS" posts in this sub but that doesn't represent bitcoin as a whole.  I am happy to keep using both BTC and USD the rest of my life.  I don't buy bitcoins in order to bring down the old order.

Another idea would be to give half the words to someone you trust (like a family member) and the other half to someone else you also trust, but who is unlikely to interact with the other person (such as a friend).  Neither can use it but you could get it back from both of them if needed.  
Another variation of this, keep one half locked up at home and the other half somewhere else, like at work.  You could cut the words out so it's not obvious what they are.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:41:43
Don't sell what you don't have... Coinbase takes about a week to actually give you the coins.  The actual bank transfer takes a few days, maybe 5 business days, but I have no idea when the communication with the bank actually starts, so it could fail if you don't have the balance to start with.
You could sell what you have right now, try to get more, and then write the guy again when you have more.  There is a chance they won't want to buy more or would already have them.
In short, you would be taking the bigger risk, he would not.

Yes it is likely that the price will go down as you sell. Take a look at  and look for the market depth graph.  The green shows "bids" from people waiting to buy at a lower price, and the red shows "asks" from people wanting to sell at a higher price.  When you hover over this graph it says "2783 can be sold before the price drops below 996 USD (total 2.89M USD)" so that gives you a rough idea of how much it might potentially go down.
But let us know when you're going to do it so all of us can jump in and buy more.  If you try to panic sell that much in a short time, the price may crash for a short time, but ultimately you would only hurt yourself, the rest of the market will recover quickly.  I'll be sure to send you a thank-you note for driving the price down :)
Be aware of tax implications... you might want to sell some this year and some next year.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:26:12
I also think escrow and arbitration is something that is made possible in the protocol but not addressed well by any tool.
Another thing that I think is not done very well is signing messages/verifying signatures and attaching those to transactions.  For example, I want to pay person A but I want to make sure that the address is really his, and he wants to verify that the payment really came from me and not the next customer in line.

I'm running my GPU only as a hobby, so I can say I made some coins and cash out.  Probably it will take me 66 days to earn 0.01 BTC which is the min required to cash out of my pool.  My estimate is that I will spend additional $28 USD in power during that time.  So I am buying bitcoins at a huge markup and my power company is pocketing the difference.
If you get "free" power you could make pennies per day but most folks would say it's not worth the time spent unless you are enjoying it as a hobby.

Great question.  I found an older post with a great explanation so I'll point you at that:  
This part is similar to PGP, if you are familiar with that.  Basically it allows you to verify that an address *really* belongs to someone before paying them.  It proves that you control an address, and can be used to sign agreements in a way that is tied to the payment in a verifiable way.

If they are for small amounts, use bitaddress.org and generate as many as you want, and then you can copy/paste the keys to a file or spreadsheet or whatever.
Immediately after printing, without clicking any more controls on the page, do Select All then Copy, and then Paste the results into a text file.  You will get just the words from the page with any formatting dropped.  Then you can pick out the public keys and import them somewhere else as Send addresses.  Pay those with mBTC just like you would pay another person.
It doesn't have to be generated "offline" if you are using small amounts and you don't care if your machine already has a virus.
Also... if you don't want to print the "paper" wallets, bitaddress.org has a "bulk" option that just creates public/private key pairs in CSV format.

COinbase is probably pretty safe too.  Just keep 2-factor auth for any web-based wallet or coin-keeper service.

We should note that MOST of the sales happen between buyers and sellers who are deciding right now whether to buy or sell.  But when there are consistently more buyers than sellers, the buyers have to take the next available ask even if it's higher than the last traded price.
Short version: High cliff walls mean that if the price rises or falls it will do so slowly.  Shallow valleys mean that there is little resistance to the price rising or falling and if more buyers than sellers show up during the hour, it could climb higher faster.

Hmm, I don't know the answer but I am also curious.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:22:13
If I understand your question correctly, no.  Bitcoin is a huge ledger where all users agree on who owns which coins.  There is nothing in the protocol or system about owing or borrowing or debt.
The closest you might come is "escrow" where coins are locked by multiple keys and takes, say, 2 of 3 keys to unlock. In that case it's more like putting down a deposit with a third party.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:13:22
The reason it's "safer" to use an address only once is, if you use it multiple times, person A can see that you also gave money to person B and vice versa.  So if you have a transaction you want to keep secret, or you just don't like being tracked, make them always unique.
But there is no danger of theft without the private key being revealed. It's privacy you are giving up, the coins themselves are safe.
Some people might use the same address over and over, for example, to collect donations.  Or they might publish "this is my address" and use it to sign a message so that others can verify it.  In that case their privacy is given up for that address.

Mining is work.  You get paid for the service in bitcoins. When you FIRST get the coins, you owe tax on the income based on the value when you first got them, at the time.  If the coins were worth very little at the time, probably it's not worth going back and amending your tax return from 2010.  This is regular income, not capital gains.  
When you sell them, the capital gains would be on the difference in value between when you first got them and when you sold them.  Remember you paid the tax for the income back in 2010, so the increase in price between then and now is your gain.  If you only sell part of that this year, just pay capital gains on the part you sold this year.

They can't spend it, but they could still learn your public addresses and how much you have.  They could continue to track you.  If you don't want them to keep monitoring your addresses you could send the coins to another site that gets a lot of coins in/out of it like coinbase, and then send them back out again... that is not truly 100% anonymous but would foil most attempts to track you.

Any set of words that appears on the web somewhere will probably get tried.  Don't use a quote or a bit of a story.  The best approach is some actual random words that you are able to memorize.  If someone else could easily string together the same words, they will find the same key.  But if you come up with something unique and fail to memorize it, your coins are also lost.
So, most folks will generate a long random string of words and then write them down somewhere.  That's a good approach but if you're writing it down anyway, it might as well be random characters.
I like the way Armory creates random seeds and then gives you a block of text to print or write down.  I will be using Armory in offline mode for my stuff rather than a brain wallet.  Brains are great at connections and pattern-matching but not so great at generating true randomness.

Yes I think you are completely right here.  There needs to be better tools, and the existing tools need more easy-accesible docs and greater failsafe modes.  It is a relatively new technology with no safety rails.  This means that for every story of someone doing something cool with bitcoins, there are one or more stories of someone losing everything because their system already had a virus or their password was lame and they didn't know it.

@_date: 2013-12-09 05:41:30
Yes there are some.. it is called "escrow".
Bitcoin has some special hooks built into the protocol itself, so instead of paying someone, you can put coins in a "locked" address so that both of you have to agree to release them.  You can add a third address as a tie-breaker and leave instructions on the coins that 2 of 3 signers are required.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:57:17
That wiki seems to say that the transactions with future lock times are not accepted, in the current version of protocol.  It looks like you have to sign the transaction and give it to the other party, to sign and transmit later.  Is that right?  
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:22:16
Yes but... it's still a good idea to sweep the entire wallet since it is now "hot", meaning you have entered the private key somewhere else other than the paper wallet.  I would load the entire thing to your computer's wallet, spend what you need, then send any remaining amount to a new paper wallet.  You can print 20 at a time and write on the pages when you use each one.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:54:06
Also, when bitcoins are worth more dollars, I think that's correctly referred to as "deflation" because the bitcoins you are holding are buying more real stuff.
Then again, I don't know if one currency rising or falling relative to another is really inflation or deflation, because prices of real goods like food are the same in dollars and falling relative to BTC.  Hmm

I think there were some earlier threads about B of A blocking coinbase transactions.  I don't have any direct experience or info other than remembering some posts.
My thinking was that Coinbase may have stopped ACH transactions with B of A for a while, or B of A may have told them to stop.  If the ACH transaction goes through, there is still a chance it might be disputed or reversed later... if this happened before with B of A, a lot, then coinbase might have proactively stopped them so they don't have to deal with reversals later.
But, coinbase really needs to do a better job of communicating what is going on.  This is all just speculation on my part.  Keep poking them to see if they will explain themselves :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:11:38
You basically burn more power than you generate in money.  Also by running your GPU hotter there is a chance it will stop working before it's paid for itself.
I'm actually mining with my GPU now just so that I can say I've done it, but I'm aware that I will need to spend $30 in extra power in order to generate $9 in bitcoin.  And that is over something like 70 days.  As soon as I get 0.01 I will cash out and stop :)

Words are just easier to type than random characters, and easier to copy reliably by hand.

Also if you want the vending machine to operate without a network connection, load it with the public keys, and then users can pay for the items on their computer or phone.

That "Synchronizing with network" is the most likely reason it is not showing up there yet.  If it takes more than an hour to catch up, it's probably a bug in bitcoin-qt. But it should eventually reflect all the transactions.
Old addresses aren't ever "closed" but can be "forgotten" if you delete them from your wallet.  I think Satoshi recommended never to delete old keys just in case they get a payment later.

Only a small amount of "new" bitcoins are produced, but from the time they are produced, they are always being traded.  In that sense it's just like cash, it sits in your wallet until you trade it to me and then it's in my wallet.  A "wallet" is just an address/account number and its balance can go up or down.
Did that answer your question or is there something else you're getting to with your question?

Another thing, some financial companies will want to run their own banks of servers just to make sure they have bitcoin nodes local to their own network.  They could set up their own servers to accept their own transactions for free, if they wanted.  But at least they won't be relying on an external fiber link to process stuff.  Banks, currency trading houses, large retailers might maintain their own servers for this reason.

Use the public address to load it AND to verify the balance.  You can see the transaction in blockchain.info but you won't be able to spend it if you keep the private key secret.
Some programs have a "watch only wallet" where you can neatly see the balance of multiple addresses, given only the public key.

About mining: At this point, it is more expensive to mine than the extra power you will be spending, unless you buy special mining equipment.  Your CPU will probably not earn one cent in a year.  Your high-end graphics card might earn two or three cents (US) per day but will use up extra power and might wear out your card faster too.
So if you get free power, and free cooling, and you have your game machine on all the time anyway, and don't care if your graphics card burns out a bit sooner, then carry on mining with your GPU and you can make 2-3 cents a day. :)
It's possible to buy a mining card or stand-alone device.  Looks like most of them would pay for themselves in about 150 to 200 days, and then keep earning, but eventually the payoffs will diminish to where you're not able to pay for the power it's burning.  Then your custom mining hardware won't be worth much in resale value...

Buy a PC that will never be connected to the Internet and will only be used for running the offline wallet.
Install either Armory or Electrum.  Save the public keys on one USB stick, and the wallet itself on another stick, and print out at least two copies of the seed.
Load the watch-only wallet on your normal PC or Mac. Practice sending a small amount of BTC to it and verify you cannot spend from it.  Then practice preparing an offline transaction to spend it by taking the transaction back to your secure PC and "signing" it.  Successfully signing a transaction verifies that you have control over the funds, without revealing the private keys (if done properly, even YOU won't see the private keys).

THe point of an offline wallet is that it is not exposed to any network, so as soon as you use it, it is more likely to be compromised.

Bitcoin as an invention is value-neutral.  You don't have to sign up to be a revolutionary or live in a compound to use it.  There's nothing stopping governments from using it, and there's nothing stopping banks from offering bitcoin accounts.
Bitcoin can totally succeed as a payment method, money transfer network, etc. without shutting down even one bank.  
Also, you seem to think banks are part of the government.  Pretty strange view if you are indeed a Libertarian... most Libertarians support both private businesses, and laws that protect personal property.

If you're just going to buy some coins and hold them, check out localbitcoins.com.  You can either give someone cash, or deposit directly to their account.  It is pretty safe since localbitcoins.com keeps the coins and once you signal the cash is given or deposited, it is very difficult for them to reverse the transaction.
My understand is that transferring funds to bitstamp is easy if you are in Europe, just ask your bank for a wire transfer, but there is a fee.  I would only do this if I wanted to have the funds in Bitstamp itself (for day-trading).  If you want to buy and hold there are cheaper ways.

Short version: there are probably three big ideas that make up bitcoin.
Public key cryptography. If you have used PGP you understand this already. I know a secret, and I can prove I know it, without actually showing it to you, because math.
Peer-to-peer network. When you want to make a transaction, you compose a message and sign it using crypto, and send it out to the network. Within a minute all Bitcoin nodes can see it.
Public ledger. The "blockchain" is a list of every transaction ever made with bitcoin, and every node on the network has a copy. They all read it and index it so they know the balance for every address (like account).
"Mining" means confirming new blocks with a hash. Every node in the network competes to be the first to confirm the unconfirmed transactions. We need more servers to form the network, so we give them incentive to volunteer up their hardware and internet connection by rewarding them with bitcoins. But as more miners compete, the difficulty of the problem adjusts so that new solutions are coming about every 10 minutes. The "block" comes with all the recent transactions, one new transaction to pay the miner himself, a copy of the hash from the previous block. And it gets a random number added to it to change the hash result -- miners have to try different random values to get the new hash to be in the correct range. If miners drop out of the game, the hash difficulty in the future might fall again.
OK how did I do

Once you use a paper wallet, it becomes "hot" so you should not keep using the same address.  You can safely spend from a paper wallet but it involves manually creating a transaction and "signing" it in offline conditions, not something you can do easily on the go.
I think it's easier to create multiple paper wallets, then when using one, sweep the entire balance to my wallet program, spend what I need, then put the bulk of it back to the *next* paper wallet I've got ready.  Don't plan to re-use paper wallets after you spend or enter/show the private key.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:11:57
Yes. This.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:02:10
Yes.  This.  It is strange that this doesn't appear in any of the instructions/FAQs but this is important info.
I would generate a bunch of private keys offline, then use each key to sign a short message like my name, or "Satoshi Nakamoto".  You can reveal the public key, signed message+signature and that validates that you are in possession of the private key.  
If you ever used PGP for email, this is the exact same concept.  That is why Multibit and other wallet clients have a "Sign" and "verify" option.

Bitcoin doesn't have to put banks out of business in order to succeed.  It's possible that bitcoin and banks continue on in parallel for a long time.
But if you're strongly anti-bank, get a credit union.  That is the best way to stick it to for-profit bankers.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:16:03
Also, if the transaction doesn't have to be immediate, you can bundle them up and send all at once.  Like, every hour you can submit one transation that pays everyone who needs paying for that hour, stacking them all into one transaction.  The transaction fee can be a bit larger if the size of the transaction is large.  (Or wait until the size is a certain amount and then send the waiting transactions, even if it's not been an hour yet, to keep the size from growing)

On localbitcoins.com you can also make a deposit to their bank without meeting the person.  You would just send them a snapshot of the receipt. But it does require a trip to their bank.
bitstamp seems to be the most stable right now. But yes you do have to identify yourself.  I think that's not really because of bitcoins, but because they deal in fiat currencies and they don't want people to be able to reverse the wire transfer later.

I know a multi-signature address is possible in the protocol, but I don't actually know which tools support it.  All the info I see about it says to build the transaction by hand -- which is great if you are already a network application programmer.  The rest of us have to wait for proper tools.  They may be out there but I haven't seen them yet.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:35:38
For me the key question is, if I buy it today, when would I want to sell it again so it still has some value?  If it pays for itself every 100 days, keep it running hot, but if there comes a time when you could make more by reselling it than you can mine with it in the next year, send it on to the next guy and upgrade.  If it's not earning as much as the power it's consuming it will be too late to resell.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:59:31
My understanding is "no" -- pending transactions are shared around instantly.  Confirmation is just additional insurance.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:39:29
Also, banks don't actually keep YOUR deposited cash around until you come back for it.  Once it is in the bank, it is a balance on a ledger.  Imagine what it would be like if you could go to an ATM and request cash from your account, and get the same bills you deposited earlier in the year.  That would kind of limit which ATMs you could use.
Also in the US all the money in all the bank accounts is way more than the cash printed for circulation.  Mostly you get paid by check, pay others by check, spend by credit card or debit card, and very little of your money is handled as cash.
The difference with bitcoin is that all the computers have the same ledger, not one ledger per bank.

I love how we're deciding the fate of Bitcoin based on less than 24 hrs of activity.
There are a lot of "motivated sellers" and when the dust settles there will be fewer people holding bitcoins, but the number of coins is the same.
I really think people are selling at a loss right now because there are more who want to sell, and fewer who want to buy (and ready to buy).  So they have to take a haircut in order to sell.  But I don't take it as a sign that bitcoins are going to be worth 0 anytime soon.

Sure, but my point is, as long as the btc changes hands between Mt.Gox users, Gox does not need to inform the blockchain about it, wait for confirmations, etc.  You have a Gox account with a BTC balance, but you don't have *specific* bitcoins that add up to that amount.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:21:10

@_date: 2013-12-05 21:10:20
You should be able to see the transaction on blockchain.info by searching for your address. The transaction will usually say how many confirmations it has so far. 1000 confirmations will usually take 1000 minutes or 16.6 hrs. Good luck
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:35:04
blockchain.info doesn't do a great job in explaining this, but I think it is the same way bitcoincharts.com works.

To answer your question "How crucial is mining" -- it is absolutely the backbone of the system.  Mining pays rewards simply because it is the incentive for people putting up Bitcoin servers and placing them online.
It's not just a fun or interesting way to distribute new coins.  If everyone stopped mining, transactions would never be confirmed and there would be much fewer nodes to share around the unconfirmed transactions.  So bitcoin would become worthless.
We are throwing way too much hardware at the problem right now, though.  The system would still work fine with 1% of the miners there are now, so there is no danger of it falling apart on its own.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:35:32

Was this an actual bitcoin transfer, or something that just appears in coinbase separate from your actual coins?
For bitcoin transactions, you should have a unique receiving address for each money request, so you know based on the receiving address what it was for... right?
If you received the coins back to some address that you previously used only for sending, that might mean it's a refund or change back from the purchase?  hmm
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:53:29
If they wanted to trade it all immediately, they could take up all the standing "buy" offers from the major exchanges.  This might drive the price down as low as 690 given the buy orders sitting on the books right now.
But new buyers would quickly buy up the cheap coins and the price would likely come back up within a few hours.
Fictional huge seller would make much more money selling them slowly and letting the rate come back up after each sale.  There are only so many people waking up today with the intent to have more bitcoins by tonight.  Sending the price lower will attract more buyers but the price you get selling in a hurry is still lower.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:14:02

@_date: 2013-12-11 22:53:49
Yours is great, but may be too long for some.
I had a shorter version... tell me what you think.
Short version: there are probably three big ideas that make up bitcoin.
Public key cryptography. If you have used PGP you understand this already. I know a secret, and I can prove I know it, without actually showing it to you, because math.
Peer-to-peer network. When you want to make a transaction, you compose a message and sign it using crypto, and send it out to the network. Within a minute all Bitcoin nodes can see it.
Public ledger. The "blockchain" is a list of every transaction ever made with bitcoin, and every node on the network has a copy. They all read it and index it so they know the balance for every address (like account).
"Mining" means confirming new blocks with a hash. Every node in the network competes to be the first to confirm the unconfirmed transactions. We need more servers to form the network, so we give them incentive to volunteer up their hardware and internet connection by rewarding them with bitcoins. But as more miners compete, the difficulty of the problem adjusts so that new solutions are coming about every 10 minutes. The "block" comes with all the recent transactions, one new transaction to pay the miner himself, a copy of the hash from the previous block. And it gets a random number added to it to change the hash result -- miners have to try different random values to get the new hash to be in the correct range. If miners drop out of the game, the hash difficulty in the future might fall again.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:18:57
I'm not sure it's a great investment for the maker... at some point they will spend more on the raw materials than they could generate in sales.  Also, doesn't the physical coin become junk after it is used?
Sure, if you have a physical coin that is worth 0.01 BTC, you could trade it a few times, and each person handling it could scan the address to see that it is really worth 0.01 BTC.  But each person has to also trust that the private key is safely sealed within and produced correctly, and honestly.
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:43:26
I read somewhere in the wiki that it is technically possible to set up a future-pay transaction, but it is not trivial.  I think the protocol currently doesn't allow us to enter transactions with a future time.  So you would have to send all the bitcoins to a double-locked address, and then sign your half of the transaction with a lock time, then the other party can sign and submit the transaction only after the specified time.  Right now this is all experimental and even with all this it would be nowhere near automatic.
Also, automatic payments would be a specific amount of bitcoins, and who knows what the value would be in a year?  If you set up something to pay X bitcoins per month, next month you'll be overpaying or underpaying, unless that risk is already somehow accounted for and agreed by both parties.  Right now I would not want to set up my wallet to automatically pay my rent with the same amount of BTC each month.  So we're really talking about some service that holds your fund and then pays your bill with the right amount of BTC that matches the actual amount of the bill that month and the current exchange rate.

Yes, it depends on your wallet program, some have an option to "use change addresses" which you can turn off.  Test it with small amounts.
The main thing you are sacrificing is privacy... now any of those people you paid, or who paid you, can track your other activity and keep track of your balance, etc.
You may want to have one "pay me" address and collect from it periodically, then use other wallet addresses for everything else.  Change addresses may add to your privacy/anonymity but they aren't a complete solution and there are other things you can do instead/in addition.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:06:46
I think the singular blockchain is not really a vulnerability.
But, if bitcoin becomes way more popular, there is actually nothing stopping someone (or a group) from forming a "bank" and doing their banking in bitcoins.
I understand the major exchanges work as "offline" clients right now.  When I go to a bank and deposit $1,000 in cash, they don't label my cash with my name and stick it in a box with my name... they just update my balance.  Similar with Bitstamp, I transfer bitcoins to them, and they become Bitstamp's coins (from blockchain point of view) and I can trade them to other Bitstamp users.  Every time I trade, bitstamp adjusts my BTC and $US balance but they don't give me specific labeled bitcoins, or specific labeled dollars, until I decide to cash out.
So if Citibank decides to embrace bitcoins and they allow me to open a Bitcoin account, and I write a check to another Citibank customer for 5 BTC, they can deduct mine and add to hers, all without affecting the blockchain--the block chain considers those to be Citibank's coins.
This is not even considering fractional reserve banking.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:23:27
I think the bitcoins do exist in physical form on thousands of computers across the world... they are in the form of magnetic charges on spinning disks, of all brands and sizes.  
There is also an agreement between the computers so that if one of the copies becomes corrupt, it is just uninvited from the club.
How many copies of the blockchain are there?  I wonder how it compares to how many physical and electronic copies of the Bible are existing now?  Fun stuff.
I guess this is much the same way that millions of living cells collaborate to be "me" -- if a group of them becomes corrupt, my immune system will eventually flush them out :)

It's likely a bug in that program with a specific Mac OS version or config.  MultiBit downloaded and synced much faster for me.
If you haven't used any of the bitcoin-qt addresses, you can just switch to multibit.  If you have, you could export the addresses from one and import them into the other but it's a pain, I had to edit the files by hand.
If you want to keep using bitcoin-QT look and see if there is a newer update for it.

You're on the right track.  The way to send bitcoins to your other wallet is the same as paying them to someone else.  Copy a "receive" address from multibit and then go to Coinbase and click Send to send BTC to it.
It won't work if your purchase at coinbase is still "pending" :)

Also, it won't be known to the blockchain until it first has a balance.  You use the public key to load it or verify it, and only scan the private key when you're ready to spend it.
If you print one it's just as easy to print 9 so you can roll the balance into a new one each time you need to spend.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:44:33
The private key is really the only part you need, so you can just print that as text only and maybe save it to a USB stick.
Public key/address is not strictly required, but I would print it/save it anyway, so you can load and check it without revealing/retyping the private key.  In fact I would put one USB stick with public and private keys both, and then a second USB stick with just the public key, so you can import it elsewhere to load/watch. 
The QR code is third on my "would be nice" list... it's really only there if you need to check it or load it using your phone.
bitaddress.org has a tab that generates only the keys in a CSV format (bulk format) so that is fine for saving/printing only the public/private keys.  If you like the QR codes you can print the paper wallet without the background images.
If I'm printing one paper wallet I would just go ahead and print a bunch of them.  That way when you have to use/sweep one you can just start loading the next one on the list.

It may become smaller as people get more efficient at playing them against each other.
But there are other reasons for them to be different, such as the friction in getting money out.  For example Mt. Gox may make it harder to get your money out, make you wait longer, pay more in wire transfer fees, etc.  So if you have to pay more on the way out, they are actually worth a bit less than the posted trading value.

By the way, my favorite solution so far to banks that piss me off has been to go and join a credit union.

Another idea, if you think there is a chance that you typed a shorter passphrase, then clicked "View", then changed to a longer passphrase but didn't click "View" again..  in that case try shorter versions of your passphrase and keep clicking View to check if it gives you back the right address.

Right now PayPal can't buy or sell Bitcoins directly, or use them as payment.
Best bet right now is to sign up for Coinbase.com.  Their selling price is usually as high or higher than the real exchanges, which in this case works in your favor.

@_date: 2013-11-27 20:55:15
In a pool, they really do divide up the work, since most of the block contents will be the same and they just need to change a small random bit.
For solo mining or for multiple pools, they can't cooperate because their starting data is different... even if most of the transactions are the same, the "Pay the miner" transaction has to be different.  So they cannot split that up.
This is one advantage to pools vs. solo, that you are actually not guessing completely blind, you are truly able to cover more territory and get more hits.
Similarly if you are a solo miner and you have many machines, you would want to coordinate them together and not have each machine guessing randomly.
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:45:17
I took a look at some custom mining hardware and for my cost of power, probably it would have paid for itself in 150 days, then earn back its own cost again, but would take longer each time until it's not paying enough for its own power.  So whether I buy a small rig at $300 or a larger one at $3000, I could maybe double my money before it turns to scrap.
If you're hopeful about bitcoins, just buy the actual coins :)  You could buy a small amount each week and buy more if you see a dip (a negative news story could still push it down temporarily).  But I don't think there will be many more people who start with $27 and make $1M

@_date: 2013-12-01 20:46:24
Yes you are on the right track.  The different but equally valid solutions are mostly the same because the same transactions are all waiting to be confirmed... the big difference is that they disagree about who gets the mining reward.
Most transactions are considered "confirmed" after 6 blocks and in practice it's pretty rare for competing blocks to survive for more than 1 or 2 confirmations.  This doesn't affect most users since their transactions are confirmed either way.  Only the miners are affected... which is why mining rewards have to wait for 100 confirmations before they can be spent.
Good luck

To answer your "how" question, when I transfer 0.02 BTC to someone, I pay in with 0.0202 of inputs and pay out with 0.02 of outputs.  The difference between inputs and outputs are kept by the miner.  It is added to their 25 btc reward.  If you publish a transaction where inputs exactly equal outputs, miners are free to ignore it and not confirm it.

It's also a curve.  Some people drop out, leaving more rewards for those miners remaining.  If enough people leave there may be incentive for others to come back or new folks to join.
Another big question is the arms race around the actual equipment.  Everyone is making newer and better hashing rigs.  But if that slows down or stops, people will keep mining with their existing rigs until it becomes profitable to make new stuff again.

You could direct them to bitpay:  -- I have no idea how well it works or the cost, but if they are not already computer experts they would need some handholding and plug-and-play solutions.  I think coinbase.com also has a merchants program.

Thanks for taking the time to share your experience.  I had a feeling such "mining contracts" were fishy but it's great to get confirmation.
There are some cases where mining is worth it... it's much better if you can get cheap or free power and you don't have to pay for cooling the server room (or if you actually want the space-heater aspect in the winter).  But it's kind of a hardware arms race right now.

Disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, this is not to be interpreted as advice for how to cover up criminal activity.  I'm speaking hypothetically here as I'm sure you are too.

Did you verify the account with your real identity papers?  If so they should be able to hook you back up.  Probably will just take them time to get around to you.
If the old email is closed down, perhaps you could sign up with them again and try to get the same email?  Ask them real nice.

I think that tutorial is more complicated than it needs to be.  I decided to use Electrum for my "offline" wallet, and used this tutorial here.
You can keep the offline wallet on a USB stick that won't ever be loaded on a networked computer.  Then on your normal computer you can keep a "read only" or "watch only" version of that wallet.  The watch only wallet can watch those addresses and tell how much money you have, and it can "prepare" transactions which then get "signed" by the offline wallet.
If that is too complicated, you can also look into paper wallets instead...

The bitcoins themselves are the same, but the exchanges vary widely in how easy it is to get actual funds from and back into your real bank account.  Some of them require days to get funds into, and some can trade bitcoins really fast but you can't get your US dollars back out for days.

It's like burning cash to see if it hurts the country's economy :)

I would only trust them with my public key.  This is why I won't buy fancy paper wallets from someone else unless they are encrypted somehow (and based on keys I generated myself).

Actually bitcoin itself does evolve and change over time, so there is no reason to assume something new would replace it (and not be compatible).  There are a lot of miners who own hardware but are free to upgrade their software.

It's good advice, though I wouldn't refer to the paper backup as a paper wallet, that might be confusing for some.

A key part of it is being able to send coins to a special multi-signature address. 
2 of 2 - Like a checkbook requiring two signers, or a safe deposit box with two keys.  Both people need to agree to spend the balance, or it remains locked.
2 of 3 - Requires two keys to spend, but there are three possible keys on the allowed list.  So the buyer and seller could agree that the seller gets them, or they could both agree that the seller won't get paid and the buyer should have them back.  As long as they both agree, they don't need to contact the third party to break the tie.  If they don't agree, the third party (arbitrator) breaks the tie by agreeing to support one or the other.

Regular computers are terrible at this problem.  There is special hardware for it now that is 1000x more efficient and most of that is powered up and running.

I do see complaints about "your transaction was cancelled because it was flagged as high-risk" -- this is not explained well in the cases where it comes up.  They need to do a better job of explaining it, and if it is because the bank refuses to play nice (like B of A) then they should say that clearly.  It's frustrating to users to wait 5 days and be told their pending transaction is canceled -- especially if the price has gone up 100 in that time.

If you can't afford 1 BTC it is OK to buy 0.1.  You can spend as much or as little as you want.

Short version: there are probably three big ideas that make up bitcoin.
Public key cryptography. If you have used PGP you understand this already. I know a secret, and I can prove I know it, without actually showing it to you, because math.
Peer-to-peer network. When you want to make a transaction, you compose a message and sign it using crypto, and send it out to the network. Within a minute all Bitcoin nodes can see it.
Public ledger. The "blockchain" is a list of every transaction ever made with bitcoin, and every node on the network has a copy. They all read it and index it so they know the balance for every address (like account).
"Mining" means confirming new blocks with a hash. Every node in the network competes to be the first to confirm the unconfirmed transactions. We need more servers to form the network, so we give them incentive to volunteer up their hardware and internet connection by rewarding them with bitcoins. But as more miners compete, the difficulty of the problem adjusts so that new solutions are coming about every 10 minutes. The "block" comes with all the recent transactions, one new transaction to pay the miner himself, a copy of the hash from the previous block. And it gets a random number added to it to change the hash result -- miners have to try different random values to get the new hash to be in the correct range. If miners drop out of the game, the hash difficulty in the future might fall again.

I haven't heard of it, if so.  They would have to know the original price... if you bought and sold on Coinbase they would know the profit you made, but if you transfer coins into coinbase and sell them they would have no idea of the original cost.

Right on!
