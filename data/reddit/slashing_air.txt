We went back to October 2013, exactly 6 months ago?

Thanks! I'll give it a try.
Any other alternatives that accept bank transfers?

Ok, sorry for your loss. 
A while ago I think blockchain allow you to download your encrypted wallet using only your wallet ID (or alias) if you do not activate 2 factor auth. can anybody confirm that this is still true?

In my opinion, it might matter how much is already mined. I think the top 100 in quarks holds much more than the top 100 people in bitcoins. I think it is shown that the [2 address]( who have the most quarks hold like 10% of the total currency which we can safely assume is much higher in percentage than bitcoin top 2 address. The owner of the 2 addresses can manipulate the market quite easily. The supply of quarks can be heavily controlled by the top holders. 
This is also true for bitcoin, but I think it the problem is much more pronounced in quarks especially because the total coin is already mined 98%.

I tried that, no luck. Can't find any seller in Indonesia.

Love the ad, I myself am planning to purchase some bitcoins, but they are so expensive.
Gotta catch some of those magic internet money before they get more expensive!

Need to admit that he is devilishly smart IMO on creating quarks. I done a  little bit of thinking about this:
* Create a currency which he and early adopter have 98% of shares in (Note that to average joe this is not widely known)
* Create a currency with insane amount of coins (245 million quarks vs 12 million of bitcoin right now)
* Buy a few quarks for bitcoins, keeps on increasing quarks price gradually e.g. manipulating the price
* Suddenly Quarks market cap is huge (because there is literally millions and millions of quarks)
* Shown as top 5 cryptocurrency in [marketcap size](
* Hype it up! and let people start to invest in it
* ???
* profits! (because you hold 98% and have a huge influence in price)
On a more serious note, he claim that quarks is more evenly distributed than bitcoin, how is this possible when 98% of its coin is already mined?
Also, can somebody be a devil's advocate and explain to me how quarks is a sound investment when 98% of its coin is already mined?

Also, just curious, do you use brainwallet?
