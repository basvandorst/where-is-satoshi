Some people "feel" that the earth is flat.  Or that vaccines cause autism.  In truth whether you feel that bitcoin is undervalued matters very little, it matters what _everybody_ else feels.

You should probably stick to powers-of-two, since the doubling increases your profit.  Buy 2 bitcoins, 4,  8, 16, etc.  Then you'll be rocketing to the moon, baby!

If you believe in the currency you should __gamble__.
Fixed that for you.

So long as you realize it is a 100% gamble. 
If your life is so close to destruction I suspect you'd be better off spending that £500 on a Brexit of your own.  Yes it's not easy, but if things are _that_ bad then it's an option.  Always.  You'd have more money by the time you'd sold any possessions that didn't fit in a suitcase too!

* That's a pretty big "if"
* And also oddly melodramatic.
"Destroyed?" because you didn't gamble in bitcoin?

I'm HODLing onto that rib, in 50 years it'll be enough to buy Canada...

I agree that such a thing is desirable, and inevitable, but suspect that in 20 years time Bitcoin will be remembered as the start of that journey, not the thing that we're using at that time.

Brexit is still ongoing - no doubt it'll get much worse - but if things are truly terrible, and you have nobody helping you then you _could_ leave.  I did.

So you bought 10% of 1 bitcoin, when a complete bitcoin is worth £4,500.
If the value of bitcoin rises to £100,000 that's an increase of 22 times - Meaning your £476 will become 476*22 = £10,472.
That's a huge stretch right now, but it shows the kind of multiplier you'd need to have a life-changing-change.
