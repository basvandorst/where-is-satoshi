yeah andreas is great, but a few things he has said have flat out been wrong and he has been saying this repeatedly ( i could forgive it if it was a one off)
i cant tell if he just does not know the facts correctly or he is trying to promote his agenda to strong.
either way it is fairly disappointing.

@_date: 2014-03-06 04:54:33
all brilliant points, and you very clearly articulated it with good examples.
i agree that these problems exist but i dont agree that they cant be fixed :)
for example;
for instant transactions you could do 'of the block' transactions where you dont both connect to the WHOLE network you just conect to each other and then it verifies itself later.
for security the best way seems to be to give your money to neo bee! they are a bitcoin bank that will give you a card to use linked to your account with them and spend bitcoins you have deposited! they take all the risk of storing the bitcoins saftley and in the day to day world all you would be doing is taping a credit card, you could proove your identity to get your bitcoins back!
and on the last one i also belive that non reverseable transactions are tricky as hell subject! i have no idea how to fix it other than have some company like paypal that isnt involved in the payment process itself... but if there is a dispute they handle it.

sadly yes, 21% of bitcoin wealth sits in just 0.001% of the wallets.
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:35:58
well my mistake i thought WU was a bank.... (not from the USA) fuck
still though bitcoin doesnt really have a 11.5 billion market cap, that number of coins x price of coins and allot of coins have been lost.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:24:05
what math? i dont get it
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:47:00
i hope you didn't give that guy your email address.
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:29:05
all the market cap shows is number of coins x current price. its at what 9 billion? more than 25% of coins ever created are lost forever and a large number more have been mined but are kind of sudo not circulated i.e the largest wallets in the world hold like 30% of the coin. people who started years and years ago.
so if you take out the fact that a good 40% of coins will never be traded thats wht your left with.

no your dead wrong, the one child policy was EXTREMLEY effective for what it is, it only applies to certain people. so it only applies to 35% (some estimates say 45%, but il go with wiki since i linked it a few times) of the population.
rural families can have a second child if the first child is a girl or is disabled, and ethnic minorities are exempt. Families in which neither parent has siblings are also allowed to have two children.[2] Residents of the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and foreigners living in China are also exempt from the policy. In 2007, approximately 35.9% of China's population was subject to a one-child restriction.[3] In November 2013, the Chinese government announced that it will further relax the policy by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child. 
you can check it against hundreds of sources, easiest to link and show is wiki
fertility rate is 1.1
and population projection show china is at 1.341 billion people now and in 20 years time they will only move to 1.393

it isnt really simple.
problem is everyone in the world would need to do this, to obvious to store it anywhere. would have to be a business set up to guard paper wallets... but even then you get one crook dude and he goes in steal millions of wallets and  hes gone without a trace and u never see the money again. 
scalling bitcoin is going to be a huge challenge, how are we going to get loans for houses and cars? how are we going to invest money? would we even need to invest money? bitcoin will never stabalize it will increase infinitley probs better to just hold onto coins then invest in stock market... lol

well i am not sure what happened to my work computers exactly, we normally sell off old equipment normally within 3 years, ive seen plenty of stuff get tossed in the bin though, the hard drives would of been images multiple times before we sold them so no point chasing that.
like i said most of them would of been mined on my work computers, i only had my home worker running occasionally and its wallet probably never exceeded a few days worth of mining so 40-50 coins~ so im not a millionaire haha.

yeah it could be somthing like not having access, which just means time really, there is no place you could put them that COULD of been safe but now isnt safe, in terms of bank vaults...
however i think its more likley somthing worse where the private keys were kept with mark + 2IC and then they both corrupted their data somehow...
its impossible to get a private key back would take over 1 trillion years to even get the first 8 values.

- you know as much about security on BTC-e as you do coinbase
- you know as much about their solvency as you do coinbase
- you dont know if they have cold storage just like you dont know if coinbase has cold storage.
- they dont have audits and neither do any of the exchanges
- their location is somewhere in eastern europe, likley belarus or russia.
- you have no method of legal recourse is somthing happened with mt gox... oh wait it did... and you dont have any way to get the CEO
BTC-e is a GREAT website they have run consitently without error without any fucking drama, they dont involve themselves with any big news or press releases and they dont constantly tweet at people.

good point, there are a few problems with bitcoin but i belive it is only a matter of time before the protocol is updated.
one thing i can think of the top of my head, which can be taken as good and VERY bad thing is FTC or feathercoin, it is ressitant to a 51% attack because it has a checkpointing system. its bad though cause it has to sort of centeralize the check-pointing. althought the check pointing will become P2P sooN!

i know most of the coins i mined were on work computers which would of since been disposed off, i had workers set up at home but i had (still do) a large raid set up for work, must be over 100 used old HDDs in my computer room in a storage box, if i could peice it all together i might be able to recover some coins but it would take me hours upon hours of time and may not recover anything.

i dont agree that exchanges need to be audited, i quite like BTC-e i dont have to give them my passport or drivers lisence or even my name, i can trade without disclosing myself and i value that above an acountable exchange since you should ALWAYS be trading and then instantly withdrawing the funds... and if your selling 50 BTC and thats allot of money for you? sell them 1 fucking coin at a time

because at the moment their is 12 million bitcoin, bitcoin is worth $850 based on a supply of far less than 12 million coins, probally somthing around 8 million? (im just throwing a number out there, lots of coins have been lost from early years)
if all of a sudden 1 million more coins became active then it would make bitcoin worth less, and it wouldnt just go down to $600 it would potentially destroy the whole thing.

i didn't find any of it funny, though i could see they were trying to be funny.
also i dont give a shit if it is funny, its still cringe worthy seeing someone ask for money for something like that.

depending on what country you are talking about, i guess your talking about the USA. bankers have absolutely no authority to print money... i think you are quite uninformed and you are just ridding of some things you have heard that have been thrown around from people who are hurting with very strong agendas.
so why do the government print money? do they print money to give to themselves? nope, the government cannot print money and deposit it into their bank account (sorry to break it to you). Do they print money to devalue the currency? no, why would they do this? it would hurt them just as much as anyone else.
so the reason they print money
to replace coins/notes that have been destroyed throughout the year. hopefully we can get a plastic currency soon. shortages in physical currency would be a HUGE problem, thankfully its very easy to keep it under wraps.
because the economy is growing, if an economy is growing but there is still only x number of dollars the the value of the dollar will skyrocket. not a good thing unless you were a bank.. (lol) so when the economy grows new money is required to keep the value stable! it cannot work over a long period of time but the US has a VERY good level of inflation, it is healthy to the country to have SOME level of inflation.
so in short, the government prints money to TRY and keep the currency stable and guess what. it fucking works within an acceptable margin of error. 
OH and for the actual fucking retarded people that say OH I HAVE $1,000,000 in 1970 if i held on to that it would only give me 100,000 of purchasing power! QQQQQQQ (btw 1 mil wouldn't devalue to 100k in 40 years) open a calculator and do some compounding interest on your 1 million dollars over 40 years. you would be almost wer eyou started since your money devalues at a percentage and then the banks pay you intrest on your money.

this is pretty key to why BTC-e is the easiest exchange to use.
1. create user name
2. generate a password
3. your account is complete, you can now trade all the coin you want without sending passports drivers lisences, just like it should be.

the fact that no one knew it was going to succeed doesn't mean it wasn't a scam, they could of been taking a chance of scamming people if it DID exceed.
i didnt translate his points very well, but sort term growth of 1000% (history would show) is doomed to fail. 
google grew 1000% in 20 years not in 20 days. 
but AH does my head in because google is a company not a currency lol

what ever you do DONT GIVE UP.
your bank WILL eventually reverse the transaction.
they will go ape shit at coin base for doing an unauthorized transaction.
my advise is to get the 20 BTC of their website.
when the bank reverses the transaction, its up to you if you want to be honest and give them the 20BTC back or tell them get f.

i dont think you understand how strong a private key is...
it would take Centillions to crack one. to put that in perspective you would need every computer/ASIC in the world 1,000,000 times over to crack a private key in the next few Centillion years.
and to put that in perspective.
Centillion.

i think Andreas is great on many things, lately though he continuously brings up that the US market for bitcoin does not matter.
well Andreas i have to strongly disagree the US market is the strongest market in the world. the US is what china, india, agentina WANT to be. they need to see us using bitcoin then they will follow suit.

WU could buy every bitcoin, at 5 billion dollars the whole bitcoin thing is not worth their time. this is like 0.0005% intrest to them. if it hits 100-250 billion they might look at it and by that point it wouldnt be to late since every bitcoin will if it all works be worth millions. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:45:15
no it hasn't? if it goes from 1 dollar to 1000 dollars that is 1000%, its only ever gone to 1200~ so it hasnt jumped 1000% multiple times. unless your going to say it was worth 0.0001 dollar then it went to 1 dollar then sure but that kind of growth is expected since its value before was basically nothing

if bitcoin became a standard and the solution was keep your passphrase on paper so your family can get it when you pass away the theft would be insane. at any given point a family of 4-5 people would have 5 passphrases written down in the house.
burglar comes to the home robs your computer and takes all the documents. he now made of with life savings.
