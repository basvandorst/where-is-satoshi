OK, thanks.  Would it be worth it to try to rebroadcast the 2nd transaction?  Or should I just leave it alone at this point?

Thanks for detailed info, very helpful!

Thank you very much for the response!! Yes, the intent was to send to the puH address but I reduced the amount on the 2nd transaction because I didn't have enough BTC to send .2155 using only the single input address.  And yes the Y7C is also mine.  So I will just wait then.  
I know it's impossible to know for sure but is there any way to gauge how long it might take?  Do these doublespend transactions take even longer to confirm?
Thanks again!!

No, I sent it from my Electrum wallet, but there was an issue, it didn't go thru the first time I signed it, I had to sign again and then broadcast.  So maybe that was another f'up on my part, argh :-(.  I've been using bitcoin for almost 3 years but there's so much I didn't know.  I always just upped the Electrum suggested fee and everything worked fine.
Anyway- if the 2nd transaction isn't in the mempool does that make it invalid?  And could the 1st one still be confirmed eventually?

Helpful insight, thanks!

One more question...if the 1st one doesn't get confirmed after 72 hours, would I rebroadcast the original transaction or the 2nd one? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:37:25
OK, great, thanks again!

UPDATE:  2nd transaction was finally confirmed!

Holy Crap!  Just checked Electrum after being away a few hours and the estimate is now 25 blocks!!?!

No one in this thread is bitching about the 10 days- and it will most likely be longer than that, since they said that's how long it's going to take them to GET the check- then they have to go about returning the funds. 
All I'm looking for is info on how long it's going to take for them to confirm the ACH link with my bank- which has to happen before I can even submit a request to withdraw my funds.
I'm sure there are many people in my situation, who never set up their bank info because they previously didn't need to withdraw funds.  To your point, if Bitfloor has to set up a new bank account before they can do all those ACH links I can imagine it would take longer than usual. 
The point is, they could have posted this information on their website so people would know what to expect. Instead, it's just the standard verbiage that it generally takes 2-3 business days.  And no responses to emails.  Which I wouldn't have had to send if they posted the information!  So yeah, I'm a little annoyed by that.

Thank you, thank you, thank you Audenx!  Not only for taking the initiative to follow up with Roman &amp; Co. to try to get the situation resolved, but also for the regular updates.  We are all starving for any bit of information, and you are feeding us!  You are doing a great public service to your fellow Bitfloor "hostages", and I for one will be joining Polymira in tipping you when this is all over.  I hope others do too, as a sign of appreciation.  You absolutely deserve it!

I submitted my ACH setup request the night they closed down trading- at around 10pm EST.  Ironically, I had just made my first deposit earlier that day!!  Still hasn't been verified (today is 6th business day) and I've sent 2 emails but gotten no response.  Should I be worried?
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:45:25
Thanks- yeah I know it will take time to actually get the money- but before that can happen I need my ACH bank info to be approved.  I'm sure they are probably swamped with inquiries but still- 6 days seems a long time.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:28:11
I still haven't even gotten my ACH setup approved- today is Business Day 6.  And no response to the 2 emails I've sent.

What does he mean when he says "I've to say I'm not BCE, but his work was where I learn some basics to build the site."  What does BCE stand for?

Yes, I am annoyed.  I tend to be a pretty patient and understanding person, but that is wearing thin.  I happened to have made my very first LocalTill deposit the very day they stopped trading!  I immediately set up for ACH withdrawal, but it still has not been confirmed.  And I've sent 2 emails with no response.  I've only got $400 tied up so I'm probably way behind others with much larger amounts at risk- but no response or communication from them is making me pissed and nervous.
