What gets me is landlords just boost the rent prices to cover the extra costs and don't care that it's screwing over everyone who doesn't own a home.

I'd much prefer to be paid in bitcoin.

For a country with a monthly wage of 19 us papers, 72 bitcoins is a good amount of volume. That's about 40,000 monthly incomes per month.

Collapse of Fiat is way more stressful than bitcoin.

BCH is pretty popular. Not surprised to see it to the left.

Idk why we couldn't make a second layer service that sends coins using something similar to Zero Knowledge Proofs

Appologies for the repost. My first link was wrong :)

They gotta make it so you can pick all the things you want and pay at the end

Bitcoin was launched at the time of the bail-out. So maybe it would be fitting to have a bail-in party. Every ticket sold (for crypto obviously) would get to invite a plus 1. A friend who is interested in learning more about BTC. The guests receive paper wallets containing a small portion of the crypto collected through ticket sales, thus bailing them in.
Then also have booths for different vendors that accept BTC/altcoins. So they can experience transactions in real time. It could like a trade show conference party.

It shouldn't matter because you'd have inputs and outputs but no middle data.

Nice dude. I used to mine in 2011 too. I had 150 coins by the time I stopped. Used to throw away anything less than a full BTC �� oops

Seems reasonable versus a potentially arbitrary start date. Would this mean 2008 was actually 1 BB? Before Bitcoin

BTC to BTC merchant isn't taxable, maybe the merchant pays tax?

The price of BTC on mtgox went to $25 and crashed to $1 within seconds and everyone acts like they bought the top. There weren't that many traders at the time and only a handful got caught anywhere near that peak ��

Let's digitize dollars and hoard it for emergency trading capital so QE can not be an instant failure and instead put a band-aid on the market until all the baby boomers have been tucked in.

I thought BTC was over when it went to $20 back to $1 and stayed there for a year.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:19:53
And when it swings you'll make your money back.

Pretty much, there's nothing wrong with the tech, the price is just a bit low today.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:23:23
This should be BCH lol
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:12:53
Legit curious if today's trading is a 1-day dip that gets bought back up, similar to other times BTC has fallen for no real reason
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:25:53
