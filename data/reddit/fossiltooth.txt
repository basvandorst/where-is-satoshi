Cryptos are the ultimate IOUs. There value comes from the fact that they are meant to be exchanged for things of real value. Goods and services. They are literally, public *ledgers*. They are just ledgers that do not correspond to being fulfilled in any specific good or service. They are have a floating, rather than fixed, exchange rate against all other goods and services.

If you think the dollar fluctuated like this under the gold standard, then you've clearly never studied the gold standard with any seriousness.
The dollar fluctuated far less when it was equal to a fixed amount of gold, not more. That is exactly backwards.

This is silly. How is something supposed to be a store of value of it has no use value to store?
Also, gold was historically used to buy cups of coffee, all the way up until 1971, using a simple technology called "dollar bills".
Today you can buy a cup of coffee using gold with a service like Goldmoney.

The fact that Dogecoin is currently working better than BTC is not flattering for BTC.
Hopefully LN will fix that. We'll have to see.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:13:02
That is a valid argument in favor of Doge if true. It actually works fairly well now compared to BTC sans LN. Good thing LN is being tested now. BTC *should* be faster, safer, cheaper and easier to use than Doge.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:35:11
Sure. I think that eventually BCH would probably need blocks in the multi-GB range to scale to a global level with its current approach.
I get why that sounds kind of scary to BTC supporters. To be fair to BCH, there is the possibility that their approach could be feasible and *sufficiently* decentralized with future computing power. With today's computing power 100MB blocks may be feasible, but not 10GB ones!
Alternately, you could see a world with different people using different cryptocurrencies, with competition between chains keeping the market-determined  block sizes quite a bit smaller than that.
(Though I have to admit that having fewer blockchains with larger blocks would be more energy efficient and environmentally friendly than having a lot of smaller ones with smaller blocks.)
You could also eventually have something like LN or SegWit added on top of a bigger-block chain like BCH...which is basically the long-term solution for BTC anyway. The BTC proposal is really just to reverse that order, and do things like LN first and bigger blocks later. But the end goal is pretty similar.
Whether or not some other coin's approach is the right approach isn't my point though. The point is just that it's not accurate to call perpetually scaling the blocksizes to meet market demand a "temporary" solution.
It's not. It's also long-term solution. It's just a different long-term solution than the one favored here among BTC supporters.
There are reasonable arguments to be made against going to bigger blocks quickly, but calling it a "temporary" solution just isn't one of them.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:07:47

Each of those has totally different properties and different uses. None are a perfect substitute. 
(Not to mention that not all of them, such as copper, make any sense as a store of value, for a variety of reasons.)
This is a totally different situation than a whole bunch of competing cryptos that all purport to have the same basic purposes.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:16:21
I'm not sure I understand. The Bitcoin Cash argument is that they should just keep increasing the block size as long as the market will bear it, right?
You can argue that's not a good solution, but it's certainly a permanent solution. You could have a future world where there are 100MB or larger BCH blocks and it could handle a ton of transactions.
There are reasonable arguments to be made that this might or might not be desirable, but it's not "temporary". It's just a *different *long-term solution.

Incorrect. Allowing blocksizes to increase to meet market demand is a solution that other alt coins have implemented, and it is an infinitely scalable solution, in the literal sense of the word "infinite."
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:31:04
Spot on. Except, BCH's 8MB block is a temporary limit.
Years down the road we could see 1GB or 1TB blocks, which would be an awesome win for efficient use of resources and for the environment too. 
The correct block size is "whatever the market determines it to be". That's what the central planners at bcore just don't get.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:05:27
No, market-determined block sizes are an infinitely scalable solution. We could live in a world in the future where 1TB blocks are normal, and all the complaints about Bitcoin using too much electricity would be silly, as the system would be orders of magnitude more efficient.

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:52:40
No. Not until it hits the 8MB block limit. And when it comes anywhere near close to that, they just increase the block limit, like BTC was *supposed* to do. So in practice, no. Transaction speeds never slow, and costs never go up meaningfully.

Infinite centralization isn't necessary though. You only need sufficient centralization. 
Which is more secure? A currency with 100 users and 100 nodes, or one with 1 billion users and 10,000 nodes?
The answer should be clear. It's the absolute number of nodes that matters, not the relative number.

As already stated, I agree that sufficient decentralization is necessary. The argument from the BCH camp is that you don't need *absolute* decentralization. You only need *sufficient* decentralization.
It's a fair argument. I mean, which coin is more sufficiently decentralized? One that has 100 users and 100 nodes, or one that has 1 billion users and 1 million nodes?
No question, right? The former is more "absolutely" decentralized, but the latter is more "sufficiently" decentralized.
We can adjust those numbers however you like to talk about real world scenarios, but the principle remains the same. At some point, you get to dimishing returns in decentralization vs other factors. What that point is exactly is open to debate and personal preference.

You don't need to dig gold to use it as money though. All gold mining could stop tomorrow and it would still function perfectly well as money.
(And yes, you can use gold to buy a cup of coffee digitally with no fee.)
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:41:00
Gold actually works great as currency. You just need to overlay other technologies on top of it if you want to make transactions under the hundreds of dollars.
In the past, up until 1971, that technology was called "dollar bills", which were effectively a technology for fractionalizing gold down to very small amounts. They could be redeemed for gold at a set ratio. Today, you have services like Goldmoney that do the same thing digitally, faster and cheaper than Bitcoin does.
Also: Bitcoin is ONLY valuable because it can be used as a currency. That is its use. That is where it derives its value from.
It can't be "a hedge against fiat hyperinflation" unless it has some use value to store. Its use value comes from granting access to public ledger transactions. That's it. That's all it does. You can't have an asset that is a store of value "*because*" its a store of value. That is mind-numbingly circular reasoning. It is plainly absurd. It is such a dumb idea that only an intellectual could believe it.

Yes, but unlike gold and silver, bullets are not perfectly fungible. The person in question needs to have the kind of gun you have bullets for and want more of that specific type of bullet.
Plus, bullets aren't as divisible and don't store as well. Unlike gold and silver, they can easily be destroyed by water, fire, or just the passage of time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:18:18
You'd still have to factor in the *cost* of creating gold that way. Presumably it would be at least as high as mining costs, if not more.
If it were cheaper than mining (which is doubtful) then hooray! That means more cheap gold--*and more cheap everything else*--in the world, meaning more prosperity.
But presumably, gold would still cost more than most of the "everything else" to produce in such a world, still making it a good store of value relative to most other options.
So, we're back to where we started, just with a higher general level of prosperity.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:17:27
Ok, but once you have a sufficient number of bullets and clothes, and all the potatoes that you can use before they spoil, what do you store your *excess* productivity in? Gold and silver fit the bill for the reasons described.
You could also trade some of your excess productivity away for other things that you could use more of. But what if other people who have what you want don't want what you have to trade? Again, gold and silver work here.
Obviously you shouldn't have gold and silver stored *instead* of the things you really want and need right now. That would be silly! You get those things first.
But then, if you are a productive and prosperous person--or if just want to trade to enrich your life--you'd be wise to trade away some of your *surplus productivity* for gold and silver, and/or the things that they can buy or be used for directly.
Plus: Silver can be used to make naturally antiseptic cutlery and tableware, which is probably quite valuable to have in such a world, just as it was in the past.

Your argument assumes that 1 gram firecrackers and thermonuclear warheads are equally dangerous, and are equally difficult to package safely for carriage through the mail. This seems absurd.
It is also not true that "no" postage carrier wants to deliver explosives. Explosives get shipped around the country all the time. How do you think they get from one place to another? People are willing to carry them. And safely.
It's true that it's not in the job description of a US postal worker, but that is hardly a free market position that employs much in the way of "choice".

See, that's the problem with ammo as currency: It's not fully fungible.
The person in question needs to have the kind of gun you have bullets for, and want more of that specific type of bullet.
Plus, bullets aren't as divisible and don't store as well as things like gold and silver. Unlike gold and silver, they can also easily be destroyed by water, fire, or just the passage of time.
Ammo is useful, and a good thing to trade your gold and silver for. (Just as gold and silver would be good thing to sell your *surplus* food and ammo for.)
But ammo is just not an ideal form of money over long periods of time.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:38:36
That general dynamic is likely to play out with any currency though.
Human beings are not all equally productive, resourceful, clever, patient, responsible or interested in holding excess currency, rather than other things.

Why are you assuming that I have gold and silver but not a gun? That's silly. The people with the most gold and silver would also have the most access to guns, and the most ability to persuade others to use them on their behalf.
The idea is that you store *surplus* wealth in gold and silver, *once you already have the things you need.* Think about it.
If you're a poor bastard that needs guns and ammo and food and land more than you need gold and silver, then that means you'll quickly be giving up any gold and silver you get your hands on to try and get guns and ammo and food and land from people who have plenty of those things already.
And this is how, even in an apocalypse, some people will become increasingly rich, and some will stay poor.
It sounds to me like you currently have the mindset of someone who might become or stay poor relative to others in an apocalyptic scenario while very productive people go on rebuilding civilization from the ground up around you.
But if you change your mindset, and start thinking in terms of how you can invest your energy to create productivity, wealth and abundance in any situation, then you can do just that, even in an apocalypse.
In millennia past, things were even *worse* than they'd be in a post-apocalyptic situation today. Yet lo and behold, there were rich people then too. And they understood the unique role that gold and silver can play in an economy—primitive or otherwise.

By that time, banks would likely have come up with practically free and instant ways to send money easily all over the world, and the mass adoption angle for Bitcoin seems unlikely in that case.

That would be a consistent and defensible position.
You have a prudential obligation to yourself to pay taxes. Not doing so could screw up you life at the present time.
But taxes themselves are possibly immoral, and at the very least, cefinitely coercive. 
Even if you believe they are a "necessary" evil--which is debatable--the less that resource allocation is determined by coercion, the better. That is true both morally and empirically.
There shouldn't be an income or capital gains tax. We had roads before them, we'll have roads after they're gone. (Unless we become so prosperous once taxes are gone that flying cars become the norm, which seems likely enough.)
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:22:43
Ok, but once you have enough food and ammo, what do you store your excess wealth in?
You can't store it in food. It'll spoil. And the marginal utility of ammo declines once you reach a certain amount. Not true with "money."
Plus: While you're busy pointing guns at people to steal their stuff, I'll be creating networks of trust and cooperation using profit incentives and defensive force.
And then, me and all my homies will take you out as soon as you start trying to point guns at our dramatically more prosperous and powerful society. You're toast.

In an apocalyptic scenario, the point would be to rebuild civilization from the ground up. That happens by individuals making personal decisions that make sense.
First, you get the things you *need* right now.
Then, you invest your labor in things that create an ongoing return for your initial investment of labor. This can be as simple as planting an apple tree or digging a well or keeping a livestock or building a windmill to start. All these kinds of activities give you a return on your labor.
You would be wise to put some of what you've produced into goods you need right now, like storable food and ammo and naturally antiseptic tableware made out of silver.
You would also be wise to put some of your surplus into other productive activities that will bring you yet more surplus.
And would be wise to put some of that surplus into a marketable commodity that stores well, is easily divisible. fully fungible, and can be exchanged with others more easily than anything else.
Gold and silver were chosen for this purpose again and again throughout history wherever they were available—even in times that were much more primitive than what a modern apocalyptic scenario would look like.

Nope, up again. A lot of people watch this on YT after the fact.

I have read the white paper. The whole point is to create a censorship resistant form of digital cash. The decentralization creates the censorship resistance.
I agree that *sufficient* decentralization is necessary. But that's not the same thing as "infinite" decentralization. Obviously, a coin with 1 billion users and 1 million nodes is more sufficiently decentralized than a coin with 100 users and 100 nodes, for example, even though it is less *absolutely* decentralized.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:31:12
That is true.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:06:46
Yes, but once you have a sufficient number of guns and gas masks, what do you plan to store your *surplus* wealth in?
Or do you just plan to eek out a subsistence living until your miserable and brutish life is over?
Granted, you probably won't want to store your surplus productivity in Bitcoin in a scenario with no interconnected international power and information grids. 
But you're going to want to store some of it in *something* that doesn't spoil, is fungible, divisible, and has a high marginal utility.

Yes, in a world of low-tech gold counterfeiting, low-tech gold validation is pretty easy.

Ah, so he pleaded to one count of sending them through the mail in violation of the law as well. I stand corrected.
Doesn't mean the law is right or intelligent but I stand corrected on that point. I don't know if they were packaged sufficiently safely or not.
But here's a relevant question: Have you ever heard of a mail carrier being blown up because someone sent legal firecrackers like these through the mail?
How do you know they weren't packaged sufficiently safely for all practical purposes?
The law is an "is", and you can't get an "ought" out of it, as Hume would say.

How about all the other cryptocurrencies? There are thousands. Many are limited in supply and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:42:53
Sure, that can happen. Such people are usually sincere in their beliefs though. Just because they are wrong does not necessarily mean they are insincere.

Who gets to define spam?

That's not true though. The plan is to increase the arbitrary and artificial block size cap at that point, and to keep letting the market determine the block size.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:04:11
Fair enough!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:23
Yes. Silver has been the dominant money in most societies until very recently in history.
It fractionalizes more easily than gold without added technology like paper notes or digital ledgers overlaid on top of it. 
Plus you can use it to make naturally antiseptic cutlery and tableware. Very important in a society that doesn't have easy access to advanced medical care or antibacterial soap.

Clearly you didn't listen to the full episode. He was *very* sympathetic to the conspiracy theories. When is he not? So it doesn't say much either way.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:39:31
Depending in the quantities you bought, doesn't that mean you maybe just dollar cost averaged into the $12k-$13k range and are still down?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:11:44
Correct. Smaller blocksizes protect incumbent, inefficient miners.
Larger blocks favor miners who are willing to upgrade to the latest and most efficient tech.

Is that better or worse than having them run LN hubs?

Anyone can use asicboost for the same advantage though. That isn't restricted, and is also open to anyone.
Again, lying to bash the opposition doesn't hurt them. It just hurts BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:34:03
You don't "need" to consider it to be a base for other payment solutions. But you can *choose* to consider it as such. Both approaches can work and are valid, both have tradeoffs. The big questions is "which set tradeoffs will be less of an obstacle to mass adoption while keeping the chain sufficiently secure"?  Different people have different answers to this question.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:56:26
Ver would argue that BTC is misleading consumers, and would have an equally valid set of arguments. Both sides can play that card, neither more persuasively than the other, in my opinion.
Ver never says that BCH is "the real BTC". He says that it is "the real Bitcoin", and that BTC (which he openly admits has more market share and is considered the default by many) is more unlike the original Bitcoin when compared to BCH.
That's a fair argument. The way to counter it is to *make a better argument*. The ad hominem stuff just makes you look like you don't have an argument, and has the unintended effect of driving people to BCH because of it.
If you have a good counterargument, bring it! That is what will keep people using BTC. Not boring ad hominem.

Bitcoin was literally invented so that people like Bernie Sanders can't take, redistribute or devalue your money.
How there came to be so many socialists and anti-libertarians on an ostensibly pro-Bitcoin discussion forum is beyond me.

Interesting. He says he leases it through his company, presumably so it's a tax write-off for him.
He also alludes to the idea that he rents it out short-term through Airbnb. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not. But it is possible that he leases the place long-term and then turns around and rents it out short-term, thereby making a profitable spread on the short term revenue vs long term costs to him.
Either that, or he might take a loss and subsidize the lease through the short-term rentals, and then take any remaining loss as a tax deduction, essentially renting the house for himself and his business close to free as his business headquarters, rather than keeping a conventional office. That's actually not that dumb.
If he's in the position where he can lease that house, he's probably not a *total* idiot, and knows at least as much about real estate as I what just explained, which is in turn probably more than what at least 90% of people know about real estate.

They'd probably be better off buying and selling something other than Bitcoin at this time.

"You can’t eat gold or use it to hunt".
Yes, but you also can't store a side of beef for very long before it spoils, you can't break off a fraction of your gun for a trade, and you can't expect your ammo to be perfectly fungible or resistant to fire, water, and the passage of time.
You also can't make naturally antiseptic cutlery and tableware out of any of the above like you can with silver.

Communism is the ultimate get rich quick ponzi scheme. 
And yes, a surprising amount of (literal) communists have gotten into Bitcoin in the past year. 
I know a few who openly profess to be AnComms. (Not to mention the copious numbers of more mainstream, economically ignorant socialists that have joined the fray.)
Just watch the downvotes come in on this comment.

Ok, whatever you need to tell yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:23:36
Right, but anyone can use asicboost *on BCH* which is what we're discussing here, right?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:20:33
It is the one good thing Bitcoin had. All the other features just supported that.
Bitcoin provides access to secure public ledger transactions. That's it. That's all it does. It has to do that well to have value to store.

Why are you assuming stocks should be taxed?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:43:33
True. But the original question was:
 "What about people with jobs, who don't want to constantly watch their investments to make minute by minute decisions about when to buy and sell?"
So it seems like an irrelevant response in that context, no?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:50:00
That's not quite right. Money predates governments and exists outside of them even today. Though you're right that without electricity and internet, cryptos could not serve as money.

Three people called in. Two were hostile to BCH. Since interest is at an 80/20 ratio in favor of BTC, and since BTC proponents really like harassing Ver with ad hominem, that is not a remotely surprising way for things to shake out.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:23:36
No, more miners means more inefficiency and energy usage for Bitcoin. (Unless of course it were to eventually move to larger blocks, which is supposedly the long-term plan.)
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:30:04
Maybe he's not doing it for the money, but actually believes in his position? I think it's fine to disagree with him and dislike the BCH approach, but it's pretty clear he's sincere in his position at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:56:24
^This. One can dislike BCH and Ver, but making really bad and irrelevant arguments just makes BTC look bad.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:52:47
They're low because usage is down though, which is not exactly the best reason.
