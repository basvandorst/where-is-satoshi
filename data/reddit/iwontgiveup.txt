You're right, that was an absolute garbage thing to do.

Lol I love these though. I got one!
If you feed a kangaroo, be prepared for it to kick you in the face. But it will heal, don't sell.

Says what?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:08:05
You are too kind man.. Please send me your btc address and I will return it to you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:19:35
No it's all on coinbase but even then I will probably get one. I have to give this back to you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:21:05
I don't want to make that mistake but u)mogredd reply to me with your btc address within 8hrs if not I will donate to a charity and post a screenshot after that. I will be going to sleep soon.

What a random analogy. It doesn't really make sense with what you're trying to say.

Hey mogredd and everyone else. I took advantage of this situation and I want to apologize for putting down my own address when mogredd assumed it was OP.
Mogredd, being an incredibly decent person accepted my apology and even told me to keep the money after asking for him to give me his btc address to send it back.
I couldn't in good conscience keep it and have decided to donate it to charity (the water project).
Please accept my apology everyone and I hope you all have a Merry Christmas.
I will post proof right now as well.

I have blurred out my name and order # but I assure you it's genuine.

Please reply to my pm or post your btc address. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:55:22
Man I don't know why I did that. I will send to the correct address when he posts it. I didn't think it would work but I feel so shitty about it for doing that. On Christmas no less. I will send it back to you and everyone please verify with him that I did. I'm sorry man. I can't deal with this.
I don't want to be an asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:06:11
Okay well I guess I will donate this to a charity in your name and I will post a screenshot for proof. I'm sorry mate, I hope you have a Merry Christmas.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:51:07
Um.. no

No one knows any analyst predictions? I'm not asking for exact numbers, obviously that's impossible to know. I just want to know if there are any reputable people suggesting specific figures.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:12:12
Thank you for this answer. I think I'm going to do it. I blame you if this goes horribly wrong ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:23:31
I love how you're suggesting I predicted any of that. Please read post again.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:02:56
Oh yeah, besides my investments I do also have around $15k in savings accounts,etc.

Are you kidding me?
