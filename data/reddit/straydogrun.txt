your wallet dat is just the base for the entire blockchain system.
transferring bitcoin to 20 alt addresses sounds like a good way to blow $500 on 5x fees.  not advisable.  just trust the blockchain

LN won't effect the type of accounting that will have to be done.  and currently the transaction fees are down.  there may or may not have been a grand conspiracy to hurt bitcoin, conspicuously around the launch time of bCash.  seems to be done and over with now.
your bitcoin wallet and blockchain address is your point of sale.
Thankfully - your business tax is based on the dollar value of the sale regardless of the btc it cost that day.
if you hodl and convert to CAD on a market high, the additional profits for your business are a taxable gain.  afaik.  i'm not an accountant...and tax responsibility for bitcoin mining is much different than brick and mortar business.
but i digress.
your business can profit from bitcoin, and you will never need a middleman service so long as you take the time to learn the basics of cryptocurrency.

 is your most valuable resource.
Download the bitcoin qt wallet there.  It’s free, and you’ll not be scammed or charged extra for p2p transactions.
Use an exchange that is honored in your region.  Lots of upset people who tried to use international exchanges couldn’t get buys/sells/identities approved.  
COINBASE is okay for US customers.  Do NOT use them as a custody wallet.  DO utilize gdax exchange platform for freely transferring bitcoin to your private bitcoin-qt wallet.
Do not buy at all time highs.  Buy Low, *buy the dips*.  
Watch as many Andreas Antonopolous 
videos as you can handle.  He’s a good ambassador for crypto.
Learn to recognize con-artists, imposters, bad actors, fud agents, shills, and general online scams.  
Rule of thumb, if it’s new, promises tons of free stuff, or offers presale tokens, you probably shouldn’t buy it.
Hope that helps.

The exchanges and auto calculating wallets don't regulate the fees very well during high traffic times.

his son began day trading on the exchanges, and when they amassed a substantial holding - they began consulting other people in how-to do crypto currencies.

its really not too confusing.  and you don't need a middle man service to accept bitcoin, or any crypto for that matter.  
here's how to accept bitcoin, from anyone, anywhere, for free;
1) download official wallet software from  onto a computer.  install and launch.
2) after wallet has syncronized with bitcoin network - press the "recieve" tab.  you should be able to see a qr code that is the graphic representation of a wallet reception address.  you can label this address whatever you want, and have as many as you want.
3) save and print this code onto a piece of paper or card stock.  keep it at the checkout register
4) let customers know &amp; promote the use of bitcoin
5) people with bitcoin use their wallet to scan your wallet address and send you bitcoin.  
it's that simple.
the business accounting and cash conversion part is where the real fun begins.
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:21:41

they are essently clones of the bitcoin blockchain.  so if you have a god wallet on kraken, you can redeem the coin.

Bitcoin is supposed to be a democratic system.
If coinbase isn’t the luciferian scapegoat of bitcoin, then a mass market outrage over fees should get their attention.
But I have a theory about coinbase, and not finding them supported on bitcoin.org certainly helps to support it.
As I see it, coinbase isn’t playing by the rules, they’re making up their own.  “Out of network” wallet send fees. 3rd party middlemen merchant services.  Fixed rate “miners fees” - none of that is white paper clad bitcoin integrity.
If they ever start charging account storage fees it’ll prove that’ll be the final straw.  they’re just in it for themselves

blockchain is the cybersecurity protocol of a banking system
ALL banking systems have network fees.  (With the exception of burying things in the ground)
The difference between the standard bank of most countries and bitcoin is there is only one fee to use bitcoin.  This is calculated based on how much data is required to process the transfer.
Because bitcoin is BYOB - and the network is hosted primarily by volunteer staff.

That’s miners fee.
It’s a pay to play system.  The bigger your fee is, the more likely the miner will hash it soon.  Which is good because there are 10,000 people volunteering to keep bitcoin network alive.  This is their incentive to do so.
Now what I don’t like, is a web wallet service fixing those fees or “dynamically adjusting” them without user authority.
I especially don’t like coinbase charging an “out of network wallet fee” cause the bitcoin network doesn’t give a fuck about your wallet company.  Moneybadger doesn’t care.
So that’s just coinbase trying to deter people from using bitcoin as a p2p wallet.  They’d rather deal in fiat and never have to move actual bitcoin.

There certainly are bumps to smooth out on the road to acceptance.
But what’s that old axiom; “if it were easy, everyone would do it”
Theft issues are arising more from the new market users confusion and con-artistry rather than cyber insecurity.  Even if a waiter did swap qr’s during a shift - that wouldn’t go un-noticed at the end of the night.  Since the law recognizes bitcoin enough to tax it, they can prosecute theft of it.  
Thanks to blockchain transparency its made even simpler to follow the money.
Gdax carries fdic insurance too.
There also seems to be mass fud over wallet keys and api’s.  Seems like desktop and hardware wallets are the simplest to secure.  The misinformation and lack of noteable experts doesn’t help.  
Payment fees for micro-commerce transactions is something software engineers are working on right now.  I was discussing the 0.0015 fee that my regional atm company charges and brought it to their attention that I just wanted to buy a $5 footlong.  For .0004btc
Network Mining technology continues to improve but you’re right, that does little for the speed of blockchain verifications.  And today’s difficulty retargeting left my a741 chipping away at a block for 8 hours.  This happens every few days when network hashrate jumps.

1) there is already a 51% player on the field.  Single account with 620petahash - this catastrophe has yet to occur.
2) solo mining is fine, that was where bitcoin began.
3) solo mining your own blockchain would require a fork of some sort.  Making the separate blockchain an ICO, basically.  We already watched bitcoin gold ICO try this and it FAILED.  Since they didn’t release any public stratums for miners to point hashpower to.  
4) pool and node voting is a thing that prevents bad actors like he’s describing.  
5) blacklisting addresses is not a built in feature of most popular mining firmware.  Otherwise the miners would have already froze the funds coming out of the nicehash theft.
6) the double spending between main chain and solo fork...not convinced it would even work like that.

Trust me, I’m an amateur acoustician and professional audio engineer.
You’d be better off with a long and insulated exhaust duct.  It’s not the miner that makes the noise, it’s the air turbulence generated by the fan.
“Sound” is a ripple through the compressible liquid that is “Air” - this is physics 101.
The goal is to limit the distance that this ripple can travel with its available energy.  Its kinetics.  You need an equal and opposing force to stop the travel of sound.
A towel, simply, does not possess the molecular weight to cancel out the force of every frequency in the audible spectrum.
You want high density materials to stop the travel of sound.  A complex array of mid density materials can scatter the sound ripple too.  Thereby weakening its kinetic strength.  
Absorbive materials rely on a “tortured path” principle to force the ripples to scatter rapidly in a confined space.  The side effect of this is mentioned in my previous post - energy to heat conversion.

The only reason for businesses to accept crypto is because it costs them little-to-nothing to do it.
If you already have a receiving wallet, just keep the qr code with you on convention trips.  Or have the wallet app on your phone.
If someone wants to make a purchase with bitcoin, in spite of tx fees, they will.
Offer a 5 or 10% discount for crypto users and they might be more likely to send bitcoin.
If you still have your old wallet and holdings, you should know by now those games you sold years ago have turned into serious profits for your company.

The network doesn’t care what value you transfer.  It cares about how many data bytes it requires to process the transaction.
Coinbase has fixed their fee at .0019 for sending.  Which is kind of bullish imo.  But the hope was that by offering nearly .002 the transactions would process on the nearest block.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:56
Yes, by dividing 1btc by the millionth decimal - this creates trillions of spendable units.

Which company/bank facilitates the point of sale btc to fiat exchange?  
It would have been better for you the hodl’r and the bar to have done the purchase in bitcoin.
Reason; the standard visa transaction involves the bar leasing a pos terminal and paying a transaction fee for each swipe.  2 areas of lost revenue for a business.
Hopefully your card service didn’t charge you additional fees.  Resulting in more money siphoned into the system.
If you’d done a wallet to wallet transfer for the beer, the business would not have to pay to receive it, they get a holdable asset, and you would have paid the selectable miner fee.

A business makes more money accepting bitcoin than they ever did with visa/mc and ESPECIALLY AMEX.

Processing time is regulated by mining difficulty and block value.  Right now, there is a massive influx of new users and bad actors.  This has caused a disturbance in the way things normally go.
It can take some time for a block to be processed as a result.  Rest assured that it is part of the entire Blockchain record.

THATS AWESOME!  really is that easy to promote bitcoin commerce
The risk of overpayment with bitcoin is something that business will have to compensate for.  Subway sandwich shops are gaining extra profits on their $5 footlongs sold for btc.
I propose bitcoin customer appreciation reward programs.  Like a quarterly cycle of perks for customers who help business grow with bitcoin.  Or bring back the days of holding a tab with a business.  
It would be less of a blockchain accounting nightmare than trying to refund every overpayment ever.

Why are we mad about the ONE user selectable transfer fee 
VISA MC &amp; AMEX - all charge businesses processing fees and equipment leases.  To accept payments which may or may not settle on the same business day.  And can effectively freeze a portion of the senders account WHILE charging an additional 5-30% consumer interest?
From a business owners POV - accepting bitcoin is a rock solid WIN.
They already have a computer/tablet/smartphone which can host a receiving wallet at NO ADDITIONAL COST.
The currency is tied to market growth - which can increase sales profitability with time.
Selling that bitcoin for fiat on the exchange is cheap and easy too.
Sure the miners fees can add up fast, and be disproportionate to a cup of coffee.  But this is a good thing.  Forcing consumers to be aware of their spending habits.  So skip the coffee, save your bitcoin for bigger expenses.  Automotive repairs, household upgrades, the big ticket items that would either deplete your fiat savings, or incur monumental interest liability over the long run.
Bitcoin interrupts the standard of banking by giving growth potential to the consumer rather than the institutions.

For business to accept visa/mc/amex they must pay to have an account with each provider, lease hardware to accept payments, pay to get paid from using that hardware, and the consumer gets charged interest.
All that a business needs to accept crypto - a free digital wallet.  Sender pays the fee.

You’re comparing apples to oranges while looking at it the wrong way.
Bitcoin is sha256 &lt;—-bitcoin is the crypto all other crypto originate from and are measured against.  You can count on sha256 to be around for a while.  Even university level genetic research is done with sha256 network algorithm.
The “altcoins” use numerous different algorithms.  4 or 5 different code languages exist in the alt-crypto world.  Good luck deciding which one to go with.  The ephemeral nature of the internet sees new cryptos rise and fall regularly.

That’s a miners fee.  Coinbase doesn’t get to keep it.  It embeds itself into whatever data block you end up on.  
Is it too high right now.  Yes.  Something has been snowballing for the past two months.
Many wallet services do not allow the user to choose their own fee.  Forcing users into a high-priority sat/byte cost.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:16:05
Yes!  It’s open source software.
The upshot being they’d have to have miners and nodes to support the network.  Or else they’d miss the plot of decentralized networking.
If they launched a MAGA pool all these keyboard patriots could put their miner where their mouth is.

Right, instead the merchant has to rent the equipment to accept the payment, pay the service and processing fees on the account that takes that payment (sideglare @ amex) and the consumer gets charged daily compounding interest.

I put $5 into a bitcoin wallet on nov 21
I had $255 in a credit union savings on november 21.
For being a good saver with my credit union, I got an 11cent quarterly dividend.
My $5 bitcoin deposit is now worth $15.
The bank thinks they’re being generous with their single digit savings interest.
The bitcoin market gained massive momentum from consumer investment.  Tripling my money in &lt;30 days.  Being tied to the market worked out in my favor.
There is no penalty for fluidating a bitcoin investment, unlike early withdraw on a bond savings.
My bank isn’t willing to employ me as a network hardware technologist because I lack the formal education/prerequisite debt.
Whereas Bitcoin will pay me for volunteering as a “miner”/data processor and my state considers it bonafide self employment.  I can now write off my power bill, internet bill, home office space, and equipment purchase (plus depreciation!) My status and education was irrelevant to my participation in the IT sector of bitcoin.  I didn’t have to interview or pass some medical/moral/psychoanalytic test to join the mining pool.  No one will ever tell me I’m no longer needed or not contributing enough.  (With my knack for being employed by asshole bosses, I really appreciate this)
It costs nothing to receive bitcoin and you don’t actually have to buy it or mine it.  Anyone can earn a bitcoin thru good old fashioned commerce.  If you produce a good or service, you can exchange that for bitcoin.  Unless you are orthodox amish, you probably have the computer or smartphone needed to install a wallet onto.
I recommend the blockchain wallet app.

If done wisely - a usgovt fork and subsequent mining pool could replace the welfare system.  
Lofty claim I know but hear me out.
“Mining” is considered a “job” by the USA.  So if welfare applicants were required to mine some “FreedomCoin” - they’d go from “unemployed tax suckers”, to tax paying citizens virtually overnight.
It’s a pipe dream with some complicated problems to solve.  Business adoption of the new ebt freedomcoin would be one thing.  Determining mining hash rate according to family need is another.  Centralization and censorship would be an obvious issue.  Public investment and securities in freedomcoin would have to happen so the coin would have adequate market cap.  The cost-benefit analysis may not add up either.  But these aren’t impossible hurdles - if the challenge is met, and everything goes according to plan.  Crypto currency would solve the basic income for everyone debate.

Then there is you.  Showed up with a used toyota camry and your number spraypainted on the door.  You’re only allowed to race because you passed the tech inspection.  
In order for you to take home the checkered flag and uncork the champagne you have to cross the finish line before ALL the other cars.
The other cars don’t care who wins so long as it’s one of their team mates.  Everyone on the team collects a salary at the end of the race.

The attack would be detected and rejected by the decentralized network.  Pools, nodes, stratums, et al.
The miners themselves are an autonomous computer.  Average user controls are limited to network basics.  There is no “attack” button programmed into the firmware.
Even if some advanced user did all the mental gymnastics and wrote new code for their miner, it would be a colossal waste of their time.
Mostly because they’d run into rejection from the blockchain.

Coinbase still charges miners fees for wallet2wallet sends.  They do charge extra if the receiving wallet is not another coinbase address (which is bs but i digress)
Only way around the fee is to send via GDAX to a specified wallet.  Even then, there is still a miners fee to be paid, but gdax covers that cost, rather than the sender.
Edit; also, no, there is no disputing a bitcoin send.  So be damn well sure you want to send it and you have the correct reception address.

Ugh, you people really think the mining pools are deliberately fouling up the blockchain?  The ignorance is on display.
Just got paid from the pools yesterday.  Along with 1500 other miners - block time was under three hours and the fee was paid accordingly.  
Cause that’s how it works.
If there is any “attack” toward the bitcoin network - it’s these stupid app developers gilking people into mining with their smartphone from an adware app.  The throngs of people who have less than 1Terahash to contribute can be viewed in the pools public stats.  
There are thousands of workers in the &lt;1ghs category.
If you want to blame the whales, more power to ya.  There are only a few workers who can say they have a petahash in processing speed.  But with how few accounts get paid for those workers, I don’t see them “attacking” the network either.  They make a fortune from processing blocks!
But if you continue to spit on them like this, they can always drop out.  Go mine some alt coin where the miners are still respected for the work they do.

If millennials ran the government, bitcoin mining would pay a basic wage to everyone, and the government collected pool fees would fund infrastructure development.  Commerce trading miner fees would fund education.
But that’s none of my business and I don’t know shit right?!

CEX.io is a good platform for market traders.
But they won’t allow US users to trade on margin which is a -1 for me personally.
I’m sure there are others.  But it doesn’t matter much for me.  Thats not how I make my bitcoin.
I’m also in the camp that is promoting bitcoin for peer to peer use.  Just today I’ve encouraged two of my favorite businesses to begin accepting bitcoin.  With the hopes that the practical use of btc gains more traction in my region.

Fee structure and wallet keys.

Will coinbase be able to protect their US customers from unlawful search and seizure?

For a consumer, yeah it is.  When you get price gouged for hardware and have to pay residential power.  You’re right.
But there are some things to understand about the infrastructure behind bitcoin “farming”
Ironically; the more power you use, the less you pay.  Commercial power rates for the highest electricity users (in my region) can be tiered to 1.5cents per kwh (.000001btc currently)
But since we’re playing government, turn that on its head and rather than consume energy; produce it and sell it (or charitably subsidize it l; depending on your right/left ideology) - solar, wind, and hydro are all green energy options that create more long-term jobs than an oil pipeline or coal train. 
Miner Product development and manufacturing - i’m sure silicon valley or darpa could design a miner that blows an s9 out of the water.  With a better hash rate per watt.  Having the best, fastest, most powerful whatever has mass appeal to many ‘mericans.  
I realize the amount of hashing to fund base economic security for every man, woman, and child would be above and beyond the chinese farms.  And would rely heavily on bitcoin continuing to grow in market capitalization.
But what do I know?  I got most of my economic ideas from playing Saints Row 4

I don’t like Coinbase because they’re trying to monopolize on bitcoin technology use.
I’ve lost $18 of the $20 I invested into coinbase.  (Low risk trial uses)
First, purchase fees.  Lost a little money on my first action with coinbase - strike 1
Second, internal wallet transfer fee - from coinbase btc wallet to usd wallet - batting 0 for 2 here
Third, external wallet transfer fee.  This was a fixed fee that equaled $8 when I did it.  $3 more than the amount I was trying to transfer.  Strike 3!
And my credit union refuses to authorize coinbase deposits so exchanging for fiat is difficult at best.  
Unless I got the coinbase Shift card service through a NYC bank.  (defeating the entire point of bitcoin)
Coinbase is a failure for micro transactions in btc.  Is it a good app and user friendly? yeah.  My senior citizen mom can buy bitcoin.  
But coinbase is not a good wallet for p2p use.  
I’ve since gotten blockchain wallet for my iphone and keep a bitcoin core program on my home computer.

An excerpt from my personal grimoire;
I now possess a magic crystal - forged in fire and metal -connected to the world - decoding a tome of secret mathematical messages - by power of the earth - humanity unites together to free ourselves from bonds of country and currency brokers - by the strength of our intellect and the efforts of our ancestors.
BTC will free the world
The old tradition of Samhain encourages us to honor the dead.  To hold vigil and come to understand the knowledge of our ancestors.  Our forefathers laid the foundation for a new world centuries ago.  With a determined spirit to live free from anyones control.  If you can understand the clues they’ve left behind, you can unlock the secret to life, the universe, and everything.

The moderate in me wants to see what percentage of these insurance payouts amounts to pure profit for the hospital/center/office.  Especially in situations where little service is actually provided to the patient.  So they basically got billed for waiting around.

Am 'murican.  And realized that 1,000btc is quite a lot of USD after posting.  My bad.
Though, the billing methods of American Healthcare is a bit over the top.  Anyone without health insurance can be bankrupted by a major medical emergency.  Seen bills where the actual insurance company payout is 10x higher than the patients responsibility.
