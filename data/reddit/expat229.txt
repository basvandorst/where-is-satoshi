Yes, exactly. For my amusement.

Most retail customers who are not techies—i.e., the mainstream—will use exchanges.

 says it's $746.4 as I type here. 
Last I checked, $746 is **not** “around 800”.

What's wrong, can't take a joke?

"Fiat" is not only "by decree of an authority or government". It can also mean “arbitrary”.

It has holes like a block of Swiss cheese. 
As a currency, it would create a deflationary spiral, as it rewards bitcoin hoarders. 
As a store of value, its price relative to other currencies yo-yo's too much to be of any good. You're much better off with just about any other asset class. 
Finally, it's vaunted privacy is a mirage: It is relatively easy for a sophisticated tech—i.e. a government tech—to trace someone's bitcoin usage. That's why the government hasn't been as opposed to bitcoin as proselytizers claim: It **helps** the government track your spending, without the need for messy court orders. 
I bought bitcoin in 2011 as a lark, and it was all good fun until it hit $100 per BTC. But this mania can potentially hurt people, and make them lose their life savings chasing nothing but a mirage. 
Time to poke holes in this bubble. 
If it's real and solid as the cheerleaders claim, then nothing I say should matter. But if it's just bullshit masquerading as "the future" . . .
You honestly asked, I honestly answered. 
Just my 2¢

Fair enough.
