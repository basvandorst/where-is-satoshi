Right.  The U.S. Military would wipe SA off the map and steal their Oil and China would be standing by with their dick in their hands. There is only one true international law: Power trumps all.

Good to see new ideas being developed.

What do you think the rake should be?  Yeah, we aren't dealing with payment processors, but we've put a substantial sum of money and time into building the platform.

Awesome, yeah, we are adding QR codes and more detailed player info.  I agree, we add the ability to view entry fee's in mBTC.  Did you enter a contest?  How is the live scoring working for you?

Cool, thanks.  Yeah, we just released so we will definitely be adding better features and making improvements.  One of the advantages we have is being an alternative for those that can't play FD or DK, so we wouldn't really be competing with them in those areas.  Do you have any possible ideas you might want to see? Something cool that you always wished FD or DK had? Ideally, we'd like to have just about everything they have plus some other cool and unique features.

Thanks. The site looks good but we plan on making improvements. Soon we will get a visual update so the site matches the homepage.  We also want to continue to make improvements, and and new features and sports, so we welcome suggestions.

Could you give some details on what displays funny?  We've done testing, but more specific feedback can help us fix the issues.
