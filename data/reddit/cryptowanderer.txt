Those transactions happen off chain.

It allows trading of stocks without having to update their private ledger. Dividends can be claimed directly with the company by proving ownership of the stock. Companies can issue more stock on the blockchain directly. Nasdaq and other private ledgers become unnecessary.

Savings is just an intertemporal transfer of wealth giving up present purchasing power for future purchasing power. It even works with hoarding of money outside the banking system.
Imagine a gold based, or bitcoin based money system. The more hoarders there are, the more prices go down in the present, freeing up resources entrepreneurs can use to build businesses. People are underconsuming now and letting investors purchase land, labor and capital for cheaper. Not everyone has to be an investor or a lender... they can simply hoard money and free up investing and lending for those who have the skills to do so.
Now in the future, there are more goods and services as a result of the investments in the previous period made possible by underconsumption. Assuming a 0% increase in money supply, the value of everyone's money has gone up by the percentage increase of goods and services produced by the economy.
The banks don't want a money system that isn't controlled by them. Their revenue comes from creating new money in the form of loans and charging interest on the money. However, people can hoard gold or bitcoin right now and the effect is the same.
EDIT: grammar

It really doesn't matter that you can't buy things with stocks. You choose to have a lower cash balance and instead store that wealth in stocks which is deflationary. Eventually you sell stocks for cash and you can buy your candy bar. If I only have 1% of my wealth in cash, whether it's inflationary or deflationary makes no material impact on the economy.

The average company actually will be able to pay the same wage. If the economy produces 3% more goods and services than last year that means that each individual company on average is producing 3% more and can afford to pay their employees 3% in real terms. The currency is also gaining 3% in real value so the wage increase would be 0 on average.

Ok I could see another crypto that does better than BTC... but why would I choose to use an inflationary one? If I have a choice it will be one that retains or gains in value.

Companies only care about real income not nominal income. If their income decreases in nominal value but gains in real value, they're happy.

If you think you can get a higher rate of return investing in a stock or real estate, you will purchase that instead. Example: btc gains 3% per year when mature many years in the future. You invest in a company that gives you an 8% return.

Transaction costs for paper / plastic are much lower than gold. They will eventually be even lower with crypto once scaling is solved.

It would work the same way things did before the fed was created in the early 1900's. Instead of getting a 3% wage increase every year to keep up with inflation you would get the same amount each year. Ok so maybe your rate of return on the company is 5% instead of 8%.

People can choose to buy stocks instead of spending it on stuff. Why do people choose to buy stuff today instead of tomorrow? People can save their money with cash, stocks, gold, real estate... most of those assets are deflationary. The economy would work just fine if cash was also deflationary.

Yes I skimmed through it. I disagree that deflation is bad for the economy. I think unpredictable inflation or deflation is bad. I don't think people will delay purchases because the currency gains in value. Today they can just put more money in investments and consume less. I'd love to continue the conversation further if you'd like. Just send me a PM. This is a subject I enjoy :)

Thanks, great convo. I'm always here if you want someone to argue the deflation is not bad side ;) My last point to think about: real value is what matters, nominal value is purely psychological. People can protect their wealth by holding assets that retain or grow in real value, they aren't forced to keep everything in cash. People can choose to save/invest today or spend today whether cash is inflationary or deflationary.

Here's how. There are $100 in the economy. A has $100, B has $0. B borrows the $100 from A and agrees to pay it back with 3% interest over 2 years. The first year B pays $51.50. A buys $3 worth of services from B. Next year B pays the remaining $51.50.
The key is the lender spends money too, reducing the amount of debt.

What wallet did you use to create it? Using the standard scrypt params of N = 16384 r = 8 p = 8 I wasn't able to crack it. I'm looking at over 1000 4 letter male and female names from US census data. I've tried all lowercase as well as first character capitalized.

You're forgetting that the same dollar can be used multiple times: money velocity. An economy with 10 trillion dollars can have a GDP of 20 trillion and a velocity of 2. Debt can be paid with interest even if it exceeds the amount of money because the lender is spending the money as payments are made.
