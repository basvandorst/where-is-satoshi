At this point it may be easier to actually buy that Lambo with BTC, then sell it in FIAT and *then* pay his loan.

I mean, it seems there’s always going to be another bear bitcoin and then another bull bitcoin.

Happy cakeday!

Wait. What if you use those bitcoins to buy altcoins on another exchange? 
You sold them before the year but its still within the crypto market. How does that work?

Will I have to declare the full transactions after I cashed out? My plan was buying BTC from Coinbase and then go to Binance and buy some altcoins that I think have good future.
I had understood whenever I sold those altcoins to Bitcoins, that's when it's taxable (should I make profits).

This is true. Maybe for the new people the target to try and do the same is to buy BTC and exchange it for altcoins hoping one of them breaks out. That may be the game plan here, and if BTC is getting recognized now while it's still early for some investment, it's even earlier for the Altcoin game.

Yes but Bitcoin has more than 2 thousand years of disadvantage in that race. It could quickly change in that the local supermarket would want to accept both soon, it's the possibility most of us are banking on around here.

Sure, will do, but this is real help. 
So the tax would be on the difference in price between the BTC bought and sold to buy, say, LTC, ARK, OMG, etc, I suppose.
This means that if I bought BTC at $100 and the market price when I sold it was $1000 then the 25% tax (for short-term hold, % depending on my place in the tax bracket) is on those $900 in profit, disregarding whether I cashed out or bought alts. Does this make some sense to you?

My question is where the fuck has that Camry been for the past 20 years, that it only has 60k miles on it. Ridiculous. And lucky. But mainly ridiculous.

Is this a guess? Was the owner paying full insurance for a car that was driven solely as a spare?

I feel this meme is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy and people will buy because it’s been right and want to be in for the next one.

Don’t remind me. I found it when it was $500 and i thought it was too expensive already and mining wouldn’t feasible in the short term. Oh well.

They want to punish those who spill the truth instead of holding the politicians to higher standards. If you have bodies in your closet as a politician, that’s yours to deal with, can’t blame anyone else.
Was he knowingly helping Russia and had an anti-Clinton agenda? Maybe, but how about asking for cleaner politicians next time so this can’t happen?
I’m a democrat but something about the liberal media covering this is just hilarious: If assange had spilled the beans on Trump’s tax returns and the collusion with Russia, Assange would be called a hero, but they lost and here they are.

Mark Hanna : Nobody knows if a stock is going to go up, down, sideways or in fucking circles. You know what a fugazi is?"
Jordan Belfort : *Fugayzi*, it's a fake.
Mark Hanna : *Fugayzi*, fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust. it doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart. It's not fucking real.
