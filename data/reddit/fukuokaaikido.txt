proof is in the puddin' as they say. I think Malibu Bitcoin--which is a bitcoin brokerage firm--is a client of Bitwage. I saw a post by one of the Malibu Bitcoin boys.. jnorte or someone else from Malibu Bitcoin that endorsed them...will post here if I see it again. I'm not sure why you think they are a scam...do you have any objective evidence? Please do share here if you have any for everybody to see.

Right...good point roflbrger...Bitwage  would certainly take their cut and at favorable terms. But I hope they are reasonable b/c I'd like to kick their tires around and test it out...one thing I think they can improve on is getting rid of volatility but I read somewhere that solution is also in the works. re: their cut...They are after all in business to do business and turn a profit just like the rest of us. I'm glad you brought up issue of the payday lender--Is BitwageReal Time Payroll  really have the potential to make a dent in the payday loan industr? Do you think this might actually help people avoid the payday lending trap? In any case...I think Henry Ford would approve of Bitwage slicin' and dicin' time to make it work for the company and the common man...

I think the card is able to be used in the US...but b/c of ccmpliance issues maybe , they can't ship to addresses in US right now. Scuttlebutt says that they might be able to soon tho. I sure hope so. I'd like to try going no fiat, no bank and see how this works out.
