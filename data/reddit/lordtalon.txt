More like 18000 unemploymed people who's last idea would be to invest in a volatile asset.

I mean we can't really explain conscience scientifically atm, but ok.

That's the thing, no one knows what will happen in the next 5 years with crypto, I can't tell you anything because no one on Earth has a clue.
All I know is that putting all your money in one crypto is really risky, there is really no harm in having at least two.

Are you really comparing a currency to the stock market? Because that would make the problem even worse. With an inflation you'd get like 5%-3%= 2% more money over time with the stock market (on average). With a deflation you'd get 5+3%=8%, so 4 times more, which makes the problem even worse.
Honestly this sub is disappointing on this topic, what happens with a deflation is a well known and understood effect, arguing against basic knowledge is like being an anti-vaxxer tbh.

No, but who gives a fuck about food or water, that's like &lt;5% of an economy.

Everyone can keep a deflationary currency, I have Bitcoin and other crypto myself...
I just wouldnt want it as an official country/ world currency, I dont think that would work and luckily theres a 0% chance states will allow it.

The problem the other guy sees is that Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, which kills any kind of economy.
Think about it, why would you buy ANYTHING, when a currency is deflationary, since you'll always get it cheaper later.
So if Bitcoin really would get the new world currency that would probably end in a big economic crisis, which would force all governments to go back to a normal currency.

Idk I wouldnt go 100% on Bitcoin, who knows what the future holds.
Ethereum needs 1 major adaption and it can easily break away.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:08:05
I rate it highly because it is well known, almost on the level of Bitcoin. It's the only crypto that got any TV or media presence next to Bitcoin.

ETH isn't a shitcoin, but a well established and a well known crypto, no reason to ditch it. Diversication is important, even in crypto.

Doesn't answer my question tbh. I mean ok, of course you can buy Bitcoin for $20 dollars in a dark alley when the government bans it. 
But any amount of serious money? How many people would be willing to give some criminal their paycheck to convert it to Bitcoin? Also what would you buy with it, when that way is the only option? Normal people wouldn't want their entire financial live consisting of making fishy deals in dark corners.
@_date: 2019-09-14 12:00:40
No, that's why I asked the question. Thanks for the input. :)
@_date: 2019-09-14 11:56:47
Well that doesn't answer my question. Currency is inherently different to stuff like drugs.
Of course no one has a problem in buying some weed illegaly for $50 dollars. But how many people would want to illegally convert their entire paycheck in crypto? Just a massive difference of magnitudes.
Also alcohol that you buy illegally works the same way legal alcohol works, you buy it and get drunk. With illegal currency that's obviously different. You can buy everything with legal currency, but buying stuff with illegal currency? Very hard. No one would be able to e.g. pay their rent/ food/ car with crypto, so the use case would get very, very small. People just wouldn't be able to even use it, even if they wanted to.

I don't even want to criticise, but imagine if the government banned all Bitcoin exchanges. How will a normal human, that didn't invest in Bitcoin so far (the vast majority), be able to even aquire Bitcoin? Hard for the currency to go mainstream when no one would have it.
There also wouldn't be any adoption if they would make it illegal, the only things you could buy would be already illegal things (like drugs), anything that you want to buy from a business? Government approved currencys only. And an average human purchases are 99% from businesses, which obviously have to follow legal standards.
Again, I don't want to criticise or flame Bitcoin, I'm just geniunly curios on how the Bitcoin community things that the Government couldn't "stop" Bitcoin if they wanted to.

I mean obviously mining will always be profitable for *someone*, but for a random guy making a reddit post? 0% chance. So for pretty much anyone talking in this thread or sub mining definitely isn't profitable.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:46:54
Can someone explain this to me? 
When I send someone 20€ online, I certainly don't have the 20€ after. I mean technically it might be copied or whatever the image tries to convey, but it still gets "removed" from my account.
