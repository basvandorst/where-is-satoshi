First download Better Touch Tool, install that and get it going :  
Once that's installed also add JSON Helper :  
After those two are installed, use better touch tool to create a new touch bar widget and set its behaviour to run an Apple script every 10 seconds. 
Use Apple script  This will display the ETH price, from here you can style the widget however you would like. 
If you want BTC you just change the url from ETH to BTC. 
But this script does not support Monero.

I honestly hate doing that idk why

Go into global and then click add widget and select the option where you can run Apple script. Copy and paste the script into the big box up top and name it and then click save
