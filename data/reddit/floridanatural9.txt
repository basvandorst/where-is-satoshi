[Apparently, he was indeed offered a plea deal]
*Law360, New York (December 17, 2014, 6:28 PM ET) -- Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht said Wednesday in Manhattan federal court that he ignored an opportunity to plead guilty prior to being formally indicted for running a global online drug trafficking and money laundering operation.*
*The erstwhile “Dread Pirate Roberts,” set to go before a jury starting Jan. 5 for a trial that could last as long as six weeks, told Manhattan U.S. District Judge  Katherine B. Forrest he got a verbal offer prior to his February indictment.*
*“Did you turn that offer down?” Judge Forrest asked.*
*“I suppose that, by not responding, I turned it down yes,” said Ulbricht, who has been in custody since he was arrested on Oct. 1 in a San Francisco public library while using his laptop.*

One: quit yelling, dude.  It doesn't make your point more valid.
Two: I think one reason people are talking about it is because there are some people (I'm raising my hand here) here in this sub who are interested in bitcoin, but are still trying to figure out if it's legit or a long con.  I don't think anybody knows for sure.  But, when an early adopter (or anyone else with a massive amount of bitcoin) starts moving lots of bitcoins around, it's cause for attention: are they looking to dump a whole bunch of inventory into the marketplace, thereby driving prices down; is it "cash out" time for the folks who started it all, thereby potentially causing the entire market to collapse?
These are questions that matter to some of us, if not you.

For bitcoin to be successful, you'll need to get non-technically-savvy people to use it.  And the more opportunities there are for the wider population to hear about bitcoin, the better.
So, let newegg do their thing, even if it's not for any reason other than to try to sell a product.

From your link below:
"*protocol noun    (Concise Encyclopedia)*
*In computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. Without a protocol, a transmitting computer, for example, could be sending its data in 8-bit packets while the receiving computer might expect the data in 16-bit packets. Protocols are established by international or industrywide organizations. Perhaps the most important computer protocol is OSI (Open Systems Interconnection), a set of guidelines for implementing networking communications between computers. The most important sets of Internet protocols are TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.*"
Nowhere in the Bitcoin whitepaper does it describe in detail **how** 2 computers are supposed to communicate with each other.

If you know nothing about the person (man or woman?), then how can you say with certainty that you know what his or her agenda **really** is?
I'm not saying that it's absolutely necessary to find out who the person really is, but I do think that it takes a little bit of blind faith to think that there is **no possible way** that the creator (and owner of 1 million BTC (which, btw, even if they were cashed out and thereby cause the price of bitcoins to fall would still net him or her 10s if not 100s of millions of real dollars)) would ever ever ever cash them out.

Well, that's cool then, for you, that you are satisfied.  But there are perhaps millions of other bitcoin users (and potential users) who may not share your conviction.
Trying to shut down discussion (like you did in your comment) about the topic doesn't seem like the right way to get other people to buy into the system (from a trust or devil's advocate point of view), and from what I understand, that's the current goal of bitcoin supporters: to get more users on board.

It does, actually, add up.
They are clearly storing the values in dollars, not BTC.
Using an exchange rate of $442.2766195870862 / BTC, we see that your first deposit of 0.19701 BTC was converted to $87.13291682485186.  The second value received of 0.02108904 BTC was converted to 9.327189321536844.
Add those up and you get $96.4601061463887.
So, internally, your balance is $96.46.
Divide that dollar balance by $442.2766195870862 / BTC and you get the 0.2180988 that they are displaying.

yeah, that would mean a tremendous jump in valuation.
still, didn't it go from 10 cents a couple of years ago to $1000 in december?  that's a 10,000X increase.
also, one of the things that i'm still trying to wrap my head around: i think that i've heard people claim that as more and more people start using bitcoins, their value will by nature(?) increase.  is this indeed true?  if so, then if we see global adoption of bitcoin within the next 2 years, wouldn't the 1000X increase to $500K+ per coin be plausible?
thanks for the info.

I posted this [elsewhere]( but am pasting it here because it seems relevant.  Any input is appreciated. :)  And, I think an ASIC makes more sense than an algorithm layered on top of a general purpose computer, just because it will be much more efficient at computing the hashes.
Check this out:
(1) Some VC's are betting (big?) on bitcoin.
(2) Consolidation of hashing power (in China?) is a credible threat to the security of the bitcoin network (aka the value of bitcoin as a tool)
(3) One way to combat (2) is to put a tiny bitcoin miner in every home
(4) One way to get a tiny bitcoin miner into every home is to *force* people to put one in  (or trick them into putting one in)
(5) People who want internet access usually just use the "free" router that their service provider (cable company or phone company) gives/lends them when they sign up.  If 21e6 can get these service providers onboard to issue routers with the tiny miners in them, then that's how they turn the trick
It's likely that the VC's will get the hardware manufacturers (eg: Netgear/Cisco/LinkSys/D-Link/etc) and service providers (eg: AT&amp;T/TimeWarner/Charter/etc) on board by either offering them equity in 21e6 or some of the 75% in mining proceeds.
These tiny miners were never meant to go into toasters.  Expect to see them being shoehorned into devices that everyone "needs" (eg: cellphones/routers/DVRs/cars).  The bitch of it is: in a few years, even we here in will own devices that are supporting the bitcoin network because we won't have a choice (eg: they'll be in our iphones and samsung galaxies).

I agree.  I even [mentioned this a couple of weeks ago]
*"One of the things that's interesting about this entire experiment is that, while some bitcoiners like to say that bitcoin is infallible because it's 'based on perfect math,' Satoshi really fell short when it came to understanding human psychology and motivation. Like, he/they came up with a cool system from the math and computation point of view, but it's clear that they really had no idea what the human element would be like in all of the possible scenarios that would play out during bitcoin's lifetime."*

I think that if the price gets low enough, the only people who will still be interested will be the people who are truly interested in it as a technology.  Then they can set to work to quietly(?) work on the infrastructure.
In some ways, it seems that interest in bitcoin grew too fast (the 2013 price run-up?).  eg: it's like the highway hasn't been finished yet, but tons of people jumped on in their cars and we just ended up with a big traffic jam and people going "hey, what's going on?  why aren't we moving?"
Once the traffic clears, the engineers can get back to finishing the road.

Yeah, sorry, that wasn't too clear.
Think of it this way: were you able to follow the original scenario (eg: if you put in $1000 at age 18 it will become $128,000 by age 67)?
Then just imagine that the $1000 you put in at age 19 will become $128,000 (on its own) by age 68.
And, so on, for each of the $1000 you put in at age 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.  Each of those $1000 will grow (on their own) into $128,000 by age 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76.
Does that make sense?

The only way that $1000 is 10-20% of your income is if you're only making between $5,000 and $10,000 per year.

I get what you're saying.  But the $10K is spread out over 10 years (120 months).  That's $84/month.  Even folks who are living paycheck to paycheck can likely come up with $3/day without it feeling like they're living frugally.

That is completely false.
S&amp;P 500, on average, returns 10-12% per year.  At 10-12% annual growth, you can double your money every 7 years.
So, if, at age 18, you put $1000 into the S&amp;P, then:
at age 25, you'll have $2000;
at age 32, you'll have $4000;
at age 39, you'll have $8,000;
at age 46, you'll have $16,000;
at age 53, you'll have $32,000;
at age 60, you'll have $64,000;
at age 67, you'll have $128,000.
And, let's say instead of just putting that $1000 in at 18, you do that every year for 10 years (eg: from 18-27, you put in $1000 per year).  Then, basically, from 67-76, you're getting $128,000 per year.  That's more than a million bucks, just from a $10,000 investment.

@_date: 2015-07-29 13:17:29


That's an interesting take on it.
At first, I thought, nah, he's incorrect, because if the price drops significantly, then that just means the price was *artificially* too high.
But then I thought, hmmm, maybe he's right, because shouldn't a *store of value* hold that value regardless of whether or not that value is artificially too high?
But then I arrived at, ohhhh but do any currencies actually act as stores of value? eg: don't all existing currencies see their prices go up and down all the time?
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:28:03
Good point.  The people who created TCP/IP are not the same people who built Facebook/Google/etc.

But, the assumption that you make here is that the price of BTC is always going up (if it's my paycheck, it's likely that I need its utility now (eg: to pay rent, buy food, etc), not long-term...so I don't have the luxury of riding out short-term dips in price).
This is not always the case, and it's a direct result of people using it as an asset (eg: speculating and trading).
