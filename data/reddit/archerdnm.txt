This entire story is bullshit clickbait. nothing in this story matches up to the headline, and all of the "statements" from SEC employees are unattributed. 
there was no 'doxxing' here. This website is the bitcoin equivalent of 'The Onion".

No one actually speaks like that. the author of this fictional post has been watching too many movies.

Ok, zluckdog, how about this..


You may not know this, but Hollande does not want the French converting the Euro into *anything* other than tax revenue. [Here are some recent EU capital controls]( (4th paragraph) courtesy of the French govt. Clearly, if the French govt does not even want you to have Euro cash, they damned sure do not want you converting those Euros to bitcoin.

Funny, I just linked to [this]( which is actually *another* armstrongeconomics post. Great minds..

Jesus, this article reads like it was written by a 3-year-old. Seriously, it is like poorly spun content posted for a keyword ranking.

Ok, zluckdog.. dead horse sufficiently beaten. Can we all agree that "developed" (read failing) governments throughout the developed world are doing what they have always done when faced with a shortage of other people's money to steal?..
1. Track and trace all the cash
2. Appropriate it.
This shit with Ripple, for example, was *never* about them actually breaking the law. It was about sending a clear, stern, friendly reminder to the next uppity whippersnapper startup that threatens the status quo... and about SARs, don't forget the SARs.
SARs filed in the US in 2014 exceeded **1.8 million**, an [increase of around]( **35%* over the *previous year*. This is *rat out your customer* intimidation. And it is tracking up, not down.
If you think shit is bad now, wait until 12 months from now, when the IMF adds the Chinese yuan to the basket of SDR currencies and the US dollar is no longer the sole reserve currency for trade and settlement. **THEN* you will see what totalitarian capital controls *really* look like. Peace, zd

no, zluckdog, the point I was making about this sentence..


.. changed to..


is that the poster was not necessarily singling out *France*, rather using France as an *example*. France, Cyprus, Greece.. any of the [fucked up EU capital-controlling socialist OECD GATCA wealth-stealing statist]( nations.

The only way to extract revenue from each and every transaction is to be the only allowed means of exchange of value between the parties, and to have a [record of all transactions.](


**WHAT?**  Please, PLEASE give me your reasoned and rational argument for requiring restriction of free trade between individuals. *Government knows best?* *For my own protection?* No. The only reason for government attempts to regulate bitcoin et al is to take their slice of the revenue, to support a failing economic system. Sorry, but *any* government interference of commerce between two willing parties is too "onerous and obtrusive".

Call LE, but wipe up the meth from the coffee table before they get there :)

Yep, but this is also why the Fed is attempting to centralize bitcoin by proxy.. regulating and limiting the number of exchanges (such as coinbase) and forcing bitcoin users through these exchanges, making trading outside of the exchange (p2p) inconvenient, then illegal. FinCEN is writing guidance so vague and broad that [almost any US citizen that trades]( on LBC for example could reasonably be accused of acting as an unregistered MSB. 
Just the threat or fear of getting caught up in this dragnet is enough to funnel a significant number of people into a system that the Fed can control and monitor.

Yep definitely, because banks *never* get robbed, or dumped, or highjacked.
