I'd still consider USD to be the ideal currency for "shady dealings" since there's no pseudo-anonymous blockchain of transactions tied to paper currency. But Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency, has definitely gained notoriety for illicit business conducted on DNM.  I remember when Bitcoin spiked to $33 during the whole Silk Road hubbub in early 2013.

I doubt adoption of gold by Lydians, over 2500 years ago, was motivated by jewelry, electronics and dentistry... It was primarily used as a store of value and medium of exchange for an ancient economy.

I like that this article focused mostly on the mechanics than the personalities surrounding No2X/NYA, but we shouldn't forget that Jihan Wu and Bitmain [conspired to protect their ASICboost advantage]( (not to mention their Antbleed shadiness discovered shortly thereafter) at the expense of the Bitcoin network.  By backing Bcash and big blocks for short-sighted, short term gains, Jihan effectively tanked a once massively profitable company.

Here are some ways that I think an individual can contribute to Bitcoin as a protocol and as a community.  How would you all rank these bullet-points by importance and benefit to the Bitcoin ecosystem?
*  Contribute code to the Bitcoin project
*  Mine Bitcoin
*  Run a Bitcoin Node
*  Develop an open-source Bitcoin app
*  Develop a private Bitcoin app
*  Use Bitcoin
*  Create Bitcoin content (articles, FAQs, promotional materials, illustrations, infographics, etc.) 
*  Speak about the merits of Bitcoin
*  Buy Bitcoin
*  Learn about Bitcoin
EDIT: I use [Trezor]( as offline storage and Bitcoin Core on my computer.  I even got a couple Casascius physical Bitcoins direct from Mike Caldwell back in 2011. I keep a little on Coinbase to use with my [Shift Card]( (when I want to floss some integration) and I have a little extra on my Android's Bitcoin Wallet. 
[Purse.io]( is how I use Bitcoin to save 15-30% off Amazon purchases, and I usually instabuy-back what I spend.
My name's and I really like Bitcoin.

Spending it, accepting it, transacting it between wallets and contributing to the network's fee structure.
I agree with the distinction of high quality code and worthwhile apps.  That said, I can also see the fleeting novelty in an app that makes a range of fart sounds based on the size of transactions.

Bitcoin Rules
1. Not your private keys, not your Bitcoin.
2. Use long, strong passwords.
3. Make a backup.
4. Try not to panic when given the opportunity.
5. Make another separate, redundant backup.
6. Only invest what you can afford to lose. 
7. Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if it's your own.
8. When the shoeshine boys are giving stock tips, it's time to sell.
9. Make an offsite backup.
10. DCA beats "buy it all!" and "sell it all!"
11. A fool and his Bitcoin are soon parted; if it seems too good to be true, it's always a scam.
12. Avoid mentioning or posting how much crypto you hold.
13. Might as well make another backup.
