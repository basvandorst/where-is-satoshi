That makes the situation worse as you access the cold wallet very often. Why just not keep the balance divided into multiple wallets long term ? If I have  6 figure value in fiat I would do the same.

Firstly,take out rest of the funds from the ledger as soon as possible, move it into a paper wallet. Are you sure in fact the ledger is not tampered or the seed word is generated by your own? 
There should be people who can be help you to track the transaction but I don’t think you would be able to get it back. Instead it’s worth finding what really happened so it can be avoided in the future.

We’re comparing completely different breed of hybrid here, I would refrain from calling it currency or an asset at this point. What other deflationary asset traded 24/7 around the world, verified by world wide super computer without any influence by governments? 
I believe it’ll definitely stabilized, but we don’t know when , it can be 6k, 20k , 100k , 1 million, 10 millions. This is why I strongly believe a btc side chain project will  be manifest as usable currency in the future not bitcoin itself in current form.

Have you ever gone through a breakup, tried to figure out all the scenarios that could have been played out in your mind, and eventually wasted months or years ? And looking back and realized how dumb you were?
Bitcoin will not give single f* about our financial goals it’ll move on..you’re just wasting your time putting faith on something bigger than you, instead hodle it, and come back when you’re ready.

Yes and no, you use your gmail address to sign up with earn. Promotional email part is there, I’m talking about completely ditching gmail. No one should be able to send me mails unless I opt in or they have to send me some sats. I need an inbox without spams and if I get any I better have some sats.

Exactly, 
using free email wasn’t a choice it was only thing available 15 years ago. It doesn’t mean that we have to stuck with it. It’s alarming places you can find your email without your consent. It’s a single point of failure if you use it for other services, verification, communication etc. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:49:15
Firstly, turning everything to fiat isn’t smart. At the time we will have debit cards if you so desire to withdraw cash.
When Bitcoin hits 100k I would convert 1/3 of my holding to stable coin and convert them over time. Not right away but whenever I need cash.
I wouldn’t much worry about converting to fiat but other way around. I want to buy back immediately when there’s a dump which will follow. And I wouldn’t touch the rest till it hits 1 million.

I get it. It is your story. I am not a pessimist. 
Yes, perhaps something that gradually release your coins. 
I’m not an expert but definitely something doable using smart contracts. I have similar plan but that involves 4 wallets, 4 people (2 of them not even born yet) and 16 years 2024, 2028, 2032 and 2036. It may be old school but that will do the work.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:41:14
If you’re looking for fully systematic way to do this there are some gray areas. 10 years is a long period time for a average human mind as we perceive it. You and you alone will control some end point such as email addresses, telephone numbers certain hardware that lead to output of such system.
I would suggest a time capsule, perhaps buried in your own property that will take some effort to retrieve.
After all it is simple as limiting the access to your private keys, why you would complicate things with another system ,just because it’s cool?
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:29:16
“Bitcoin has gotten too popular”, U kidding me? 
Only people into tech or fintech knows, you may be exposed to channels built around your interest of bitcoin, likeminded people around you.
Others like ‘bit’what? , at least from my experience. 
If you cannot show numbers it is more popular with everyday joes than 5years ago then you’re just making things up.

So in the business insider markets. Bitcoin is no longer cypherpunk or gambling play money. Apparently, financial markets going to drive the next bull run. This is the next level we were all counting on, the recognition as an asset. After all Bitcoin is the only mathematically guaranteed deflationary asset.

Probably one of the most well-known fintech terms and widely known in mainstream finance. -HSBC
@_date: 2019-02-13 03:30:33
When it touches previous ATH that will debunk most of naysayers, then only a sustainable bull run will kick off. 
My point of view, it’ll happen eventually after 2020 halving. Finally, 250k - 500k anywhere between 2022 to 2025. If the current rate continues with lightning network the adoption will be parabolic, that will make USD value irrelevant anyways.
One can say I’m delusional, I’m talking about magic internet money after all. So who cares.

Seems you have misinterpreted. Deflationary in term of the flow of the total supply and this has been mathematically guaranteed. Max supply of the Bitcoin is fixed at 21million. Can you think of  any other asset class has this property ? for that reason there is no term "Deflationary asset" which was made up.

Firstly , I would like to congratulate, it’s quite a achievement regardless of where you lives. You have converted your hard earned money to harder money, much harder it ever could be, whole unit of it. The cult of 21mil.
But it means nothing if you do not control your private keys. Celebrate truly when it transferred to your own wallet. all the best.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:47:10
Well for an example,tangible assets, money in bank accounts can be ceased either during transacting or just having legal ownership to your name. To move bitcoins I can just transfer them to a address anonymously and send my private key/bip32 phrases to other party. This way I don’t even have to have a software/hardware wallet with me.
I don’t have any problem flying with couple of bitcoins because it’s just matter of controlling keys.
They know this that’s why they’re afraid. 
You either party with your enemy or face inevitable defeat. Cheers..
@_date: 2019-04-17 01:13:11
As most people think it’s not about fiat value. It means you control ownership of 1 or more bitcoins which will be only 21 million of them will be ever created.

All the best. I am truly happy none the less inspired as an another individual who seek similar kind of financial freedom in the future, though where I’m living  300k USD would grant me that kind of luxury :).

I entered early 2017. I’m from a developing country and doing highly paying job according to country standards , I get paid in usd but paying hefty amount of government tax + local currency keep heading to shit compared to usd, being middle working class individual having a decent life becoming more expensive.
I also started hating my job which is really a grind to survive while your own government leeching on you every way possible. So finally decided to convert what I earn slowly to something uncorrelated with higher power.
It may be too dramatic way to put how I get in to space ,though it’s proving itself that the decision was right. I’m still buying and will keep buying..
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:10:32
Money supposed to be TRUST, trusting the system/issuer that currency will sustain its value over time, which appears to be not the case. Thus trust should be governs by something inherently trustworthy, an autonomous system.
