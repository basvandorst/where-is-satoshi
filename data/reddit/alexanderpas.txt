Bitcoin for those big transactions, lightning for the small ones.
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:23:51
The difference being that there are only a limited number of bitcoins, but an unlimited supply of USD.
If there was a hard limit on the USD instead of a soft limit, things would look differently.
The approximate supply of new bitcoin is well know in advance, and the value of a bitcoin is solely based on supply and demand from people selling and buying based on external factors, but those external factors can't change the amount of bitcoin.
If someone is willing to take out an insurance policy, or has enough money, they can peg the lower value of a bitcoin.
An insurance policy of $21 million in value pegs the lower bound for bitcoins value to at least $1 per bitcoin.

Start using debit cards with pin&amp;chip and Direct deposit transfers instead of credit cards with signatures and checks with signatures.

Confirmed American.
Here's a tip: If you have over 10 coins of a single denomination in your wallet, you are using them wrong!
If you can't make it exact change, you can make it close change.
If something is ¥1845 and you do have ¥345 in your wallet, but no ¥500 coin, don't pay ¥2000, pay ¥2345 instead.
Even if you can't pay ¥2345 exactly, but you can pay ¥2350, it's still better than paying ¥2000

except there are scumbag bosses that do it differently:
- Customer has a bill of $85 and adds a $15 tip.
- Credit card company takes $3.
- Restaurant owner gets $97.
- Restaurant owner gives server $12. (97-85)
**THIS IS ILLEGAL.**

True, that is the US situation.
What I'm telling you is that every single bumfuck store that accepts a card needs to have a customer facing terminal in Europe.
Swipe &amp; Sign is simply not a method of payment for Europe.

You're wrong, and I'm right.
Minimum wage obligation means that the employee should always earn at least $7.25/hour no matter the amount of tips.
Tip credit means that the employer only has to pay $2.13/hour in wages if wages + tips make the employee over $7.25/hour.

Could still be possible if the dollar goes to zimbabwe.
Also, the current US debt is almost 40 billion bitcoins.
To be able to cover the current US debt, and assuming ~12.75 million bitcoins currently in circulation, 1 bitcoin has to be worth ~$1.35 million to cover that debt.

In Europe we solved the card problem decades ago, with PIN &amp; Swipe and now with PIN &amp; Chip.
Since PIN entry requires a customer facing terminal, adding the swipe slot or chip connector on the customer side in a single unit is the easy thing. This also means you don't need to surrender your card.
To accept bitcoin, all that is needed is a slightly larger display on the customer side.
Meanwhile in the US, they don't even use two factor authentication.

maybe they already did.

And that is illegal.

  - Restaurant owner is liable for $3 and gets $97.
  - Server is liable for nothing and gets $20.

A public ledger of transactions of proof of works, where the proof of work is is based on verification of the transactions of proof of works and the previous proof of works in a single, unbroken chain of proof of works.


Whenever a proof of work is completed, it is signed using PKI encryption, allowing the proof of work to be associated with an adress, of which the creator of the proof of work has the private keys.


Private keys belonging to a public address allowing the owner of those private keys to identify himself as the owner of the public address


By directly or indirectly accessing the private keys, either trough compromised accounts with the party controlling the private keys, or by directly obtaining access to the private keys, and creating a new transaction of the proof of work, by verifying as the owner of the proof of work using the private keys.


There are markets willing to trade the proof of works for cash, and where you can buy the proof of works by paying cash.
(please correct me if this can be improved)

Even while it is legit, the implementation of SOFORT is one of the more sketchy of all payment methods.
SOFORT asks the login details of customers bank account, so SOFORT can login in the customers bank account, to enable SOFORT to transfer the amount requested to the vendor using the customers account.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:37:26
You are wrong.
SEPA means there is no difference between foreign and domestic euro payments in the SEPA area.
There is literally no need to have a credit card as long as you are paying with euro in the SEPA area.
Also credit cards are an additional cost and liability on top of your standard bank card that works anywhere in the SEPA area with no change in costs if paying in euros.
