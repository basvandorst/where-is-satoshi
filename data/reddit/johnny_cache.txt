Does Rogan have a BTC address?

I guess I'm more worried about them being stolen than I am losing/misplacing them.  
The phrase on the paper wallet gets converted into a public and private key. Does the public key exist out on the blockchain? I ask because I'm trying to determine what would be more likely: someone guessing the phrase on my paper wallet (and figuring out my public/private key combo and then extracting them from that address) or someone stealing my wallet.dat file (or the hardware it's on bugging out).. I have a feeling a very long, complex, unique paper wallet would be the most secure (at least for long term storage).

Do what exactly does this mean with regards to running a Bitcoin ATM? Is it legal to do so? If so, what kind of tax/regulations are going to apply?

What's the difference storing Bitcoins in a paper wallet versus in a wallet.dat file?  Where do each exist?  What are the pros/cons of each approach?

Well when you open it up let me know, I'll help with some bugs..
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:46:52
Haha! That's hilarious!

Can you explain why a mining company pushing the price of BTC down would drive out its competition?
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:50:12
Nice find!  Is the code anywhere on Github?

What does a customer who had BTCs on MtGox (prior to them filing for bankruptcy) need to do in order to get any BTCs back after the trial is resolved?

Do you not use Gyft to purchase stuff on Amazon?
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:50:09
Do you anticipate getting any of it back? After all, they found 200,000 btc after they filed for bankruptcy.

 How many coins did you move? A rough estimate is fine, if you don't mind me asking

Where is the source to this quote?

Can you explain this a little better.  What exactly is "the 10% or 15% ordinary income tax bracket"?

How long have you been waiting?  And have you ever purchased from them before?

Why do you say it's 'almost impossible to extract fiat, at least USD, from gox'?  I'm in the process of linking my bank account with MtGox so that I can withdraw USD.  Is there something I should know?
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:40:58
Do they accept BTC or did you convert to fiat and pay for the flight?
@_date: 2013-08-31 19:09:51
Please do.  If you need help I've got ruby/rails and python experience.

Can you make me one of these?

Which BTC exchange do they use to calculate the exchange rate?  
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:18:46
I'd there any resource with a listing of lawyers who are competent with BTC (preferably by city)? It seems like if I need a lawyer, if like one that's local and somewhat aware of what's going on with crypto currencies.

I thought I read something the other day where the Chinese government said they didn't plan on regulating Bitcoins.  Am I mistaken?
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:14:55
That's exactly what I thought when I saw this!
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:23:33
I couldn't find a way.  I wonder what they're doing with them once they take them off your hands..
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:54:14
Nice!  I'll take a look at their prices... I could use a vacation this winter.  Cheers

I like **BitCent** (0.01BTC).  
1BitCent would cost $6.55 based on Mt. Gox's rate right now.

Nice! You're convincing me to give them a try. How long do they typically last?
