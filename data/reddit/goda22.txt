Please see my mention of the Dotcom bubble. It didn't bring an end to the internet but it did pretty much destroy the industry leaving on a handful (microsoft, amazon, etc) companies alive

If USDT fails or is found to be fraud... It will pretty much destroy the Cryptocurrency landscape as we know it and it will possibly never recover. 
Now this is a scenario for CRYPTOCURRENCY. 
I believe no matter what blockchain technology and all the evolution of the technology will survive. 
Kind of like the dotcom bubble. The internet didn't disappear only the companies tried to exploit the hype. unfortunately there was a lot of people invested in those companies.

If it only brings a dip then that would be a blessing. But given the fact that it is highly possible that tether artificially increased the price of BTC with USDT with no monetary value will create a lot of problems for cryptocurrency in general. 
Look I understand you love whatever coins/tokens you're"hodling" in your "cold storage wallet". I get it. I'm a fan of everything BTC has done for decentralization of currency and the creation of blockchain. 
But you're not understand the consequences the  exchange in the world  exchange in the west collapsing due to market manipulation and fraud.

Two key words I used in my statement "IF" and "Possibly". 
If you just look at the current circulating supply or USDT its 2,278,090,824 USDT. Which by theory would mean that there is $2,278,090,824 worth of cryptocurrency (1USDT = $1 USD). If it is found to be fraud it would drop prices of cryptocurrency for correction. 
But this isn't the whole problem USDT CEO is the same as Bitfinex one of the largest exchanges in the world. If USDT is found fraud it will pretty much destroy Bitfinex as an exchange because the lack of trust in the company and we all heard the horror stories of what happened when Mt. Gox collapsed. 
This is just my opinion of what would happen if USDT was found as a fraud. I use USDT as a safety net when the market is dipping so I hope it's not true.

Bitcoin is the mother coin. 
When bitcoin moves everything moves. 
This is why bitcoin can’t fail. It can be replaced but cannot be allowed to fail.

Welcome to crypto! 
It’s going to be a fun ride so don’t panic!
If you’re going to hodl take your BTC off the exchange put it in a cold storage wallet or paper wallet. Try not to watch the market all the time cause it can be stressful. 
Also there are some amazing altcoins out there with some great tech or utility. Do some research and try investing in some if you want. 
Some simple rules
1) buy low sell high 
2) try not to fall for FUD and FOMO
3) unless you’re very confident don’t day trade
Hope you achieve your moon/lambo!

Agreed I would like some recommendations on some good reads on fundamental on trading crypto. Cause it’s a strange monster.

Try GDAX if trading at the exact amount you want is absolutely important. 
GDAX is the pro version of Coinbase as it is the same company.

Hahaha South Korea

I really like my nano s

Coinbase is not bad.
It's market rate and the fees are (if in the US) 1.49% to withdrawn to bank account 4% to paypal. It's a good platform for learning.

Looks good enough
It’s all about protecting your crypto

I don’t hold any BTC or Bitcoin Cash... but that Roger guy just really turned me off from Bitcoin Cash...
He’s the CEO of bitcoin cash right? So it’s just a business for him yes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:45
Coinbase is a good starting point
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:45:03
you'll be good this time next year
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:23:57
Same here
I’m in Korea for the holidays with my coins in my nano locked in my safe at home. 
I know for sure if ili was next to it I would be itching a bit. Testing my hodl resistance hahaha. 
Although I really have the urge to buy buy buy right now but coinbase keeps rejecting my identification. IDK why I have to do it again when I did it before.

I would say that a lot of people that were holding altcoins are selling to accumulate btc to ride gain train. They will recover once this amazing upward trend slows a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:46:56
I would also like to know how you acquired these.

I hope that I'm incorrect also and given all the recent news about tether I feel much better about it but still skeptical. 
The reason why it's a big deal is not cause market cap. Market Cap should not be used to determine the importance or actual usage of crypto. If you look at 24hr trading volume. USDT is number two right under bitcoin. This is the scary part. USDT is traded a lot. If something with such a high volume is found a scam it can potentially shatter the belief in crypto.
