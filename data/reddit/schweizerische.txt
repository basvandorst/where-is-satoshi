Bitcoin's limited and constantly decreasing supply.

Found out very lately. Hooked immediately. Bought at 800 to 1000 a little. Trying to save every cent to buy more. But that it not very easy.

Moral of the story: your bitcoins can be stolen even if you are black!
Oh gosh, that cop have stolen my bitcoins, its all cause i am black. How can you steal from black? Steal from white!

Yes, very good analogy. World's IPO!

No hashing algorithm though.

This was a preparty actually.

If you do not have united states bank account people used Circle to buy from cards. Now they are collapsed (temporarily I hope).

They gone nuts long ago. But selfie is craziness.

No, I'm just kidding. it is so nice to bring again the fact that fiat currency is total crap.
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:05:50
I hold. Will not sell.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:15:28
You can never know if you card will be linked and if transactions will go through.

It seems to me that there is one. It is called BITCOIN. I know it sounds strange, however it works!
But if you purchase bits from businesses they will get your ID info saved for calling a ter...

"Deflationary currency completely changed my mindset for the better. The implications of this, if the entire world gets the same mindset, could be devastating for the corporations but extremely beneficial to the environment and the world."
This is the most important! It so cool to see there are people like me.
@_date: 2014-08-08 06:10:36
Yes, definitely would NOT put a single Bitcoin there. Look at Aethereum Project here:  It distributes coins proportionally to current blockchain allocation **free of charge**.
Ethereum is a scam.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:53:29
Now let me help with it. I buy now! Let's see!
@_date: 2014-10-04 07:14:22
Just start buying
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:55:06
**Not if you use Coinbase**
@_date: 2014-10-13 05:14:09
Circle always takes 2.9-3% fee per each transaction from me.

Buying now can't wait longer.
@_date: 2014-08-10 16:39:08
Definitely. 0.0001 is too much.
@_date: 2014-10-04 07:13:09
It is not a ban really. Everything is much better than expected. There is no way to control and catch. And only fines. Not big.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:20:29
no. I meant fines. (штрафы)

1/21000000 of all world. For it to become true we would need to inform people of The New Pure and Real Hard Currency. Majority still doesn't know...
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:08:21
Ok. Very simple. Thx.
@_date: 2014-09-21 08:49:41
Or $10,000 which is also likely.

I am totally pro Bits. Best unit. It can boost the price.

Now you are a Bitcoiner till the end of your days. God bless you!

How the uniqueness of address and keys is facilitated especially when addresses are created offline? How cryptography works so that that your offline key is legit and not anyone's else?

[BitcoinEmirates.com]( there.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:53:38
It is unbelievable what you guys do! Russian are true geniuses but they can't/don't want to get money!
Just can't imagine how you've given to the world all that for free!
Unbelievable! GOD BLESS RUSSIANS!

Why full nodes are so important? Are these critical?
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:11:33
Since they went international (I am a non-US client myself) their service became unusable. All accounts of my friends were suspended as well as mine. Several messages sent to them during a week left without reply. I got only one strange reply that since I am a non-US my transactions won't go (there are 2 transactions still pending for several days). Sounds nonsense since they work globally now.
Being in need to buy bits, I created a new account. After same suspension and a message to support I got an a message that 'multiple accounts detected'. So what were they waiting for?
Sone amount of bits still stays blocked. Don't know what else should I do to get access to my bits.
@_date: 2015-05-25 14:55:49

I think there are no fools to use Coinbase at all. Go find that fool! No such.
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:39:09
They have limits. Prices in ATMs are awful. And there are only 2 in Zurich. That shitty cafe where ATM is located will call for cops if they see you with cases)))
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:36:56
Got some funny replies. You guys are great. Love you all.
Anyway I am looking for big bitcoin seller for cash.
