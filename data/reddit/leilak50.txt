They will definitely get curious...and depending on how it is presented...they will be researching and asking around about it....get ready...

What world do you live in? Did you not know that there is over a 100 billion dollars made in crypto?....I guess you don't research or read very much...A million dollars is chump change in the crypto world....Yes cashing out at the moment can be a pain...but knowing there are whales out there with 10's of millions in btc....and knew someone on face book that would be in that group....They definitely cashed out enough to live a luxury lifestyle....I for one intend to cash out a portion of my investments...but only when it has matured...I will then invest in traditional investments to diversify....and majority left in crypto...until the right time....or that day may never come...If my mortgage is less than 5% of my investment portfolio would be the only time I would pay it off....Never heard it to be wise to cash out entire investment to pay off house...In fact it is strongly NOT advised...

Exactly my thoughts....me too...devil's advocate here....Bitcoin has only just begun it's climb....What just happened in the past few weeks has solidified bitcoin's future...I always heard the opposite about paying off your mortgage...but not by average folk...cause that is what they all think...Successful investors do not cash out investments (especially one's that have not matured) to pay off their home...It doesn't make sense...21 btc????....and at less than 10k???....Why would you settle for 200k???....You bought at $130???....You realize you have now lost all oppportunity to make any substanial amount in the future?...Your house is paid off but you are poor now....What was the point of the investment?...Investment money is supposed to be for your retirement....And if you waited at least another year or 2...You would have had 10-20 times more...but imo...not enough to retire on...Paying your mortgage for 1-2 years more couldn't be as bad as missing out on cashing out $1 million....Which again imo is not even enough to retire with now....let alone in 10, 20, 30 years.....
