Why is everyone in this freaking subreddit defensive? Fuck!
I meant that as they kinda know it doesn't matter! If I see the price dropping and I know I'll get 100k I'll buy I am not gonna wait.
Get your stock market brain together and don't think everyone is commenting against what you say. Morons

If you only had not used stupid that many times people would take you seriously.

Anything you own can be confiscated.
Are people totally stupid? The dollar the euro or whatever can automatically become a digital currency. For example many countries don't allow big purchases in cash. Switching to digital only is not an issue and would eventually become the norm thus saying the dollar is finite is just wrong... On the other hand Bitcoin is finite. What the fuck man?

1 euro = 1 euro. What's your point?

Yes there is something. They are already rich. They play with the off odds with the small chances of multiplying their wealth but they can do that because even if they are wrong they will still wake up rich.
Furthermore why wouldn't they tell you that this is going to be great when obviously they will profit in multiple ?

Nutella now sells chocolate shape coins! This is a great step for Bitcoin.
This is exactly the OP's mindset.
So you think people without internet are like "damn if only I could use those bitcoins I bought when I went to the local internet cafe."
Or even "now I can mine BTC in my house near the grand canyon".
Man you loco?

In the same logic if you buy a house it is still not yours because the government can take it. In the same logic if u have crypto on your laptop it is not yours because the police can seize your assets with probable cause.
Stop the bullshit.
