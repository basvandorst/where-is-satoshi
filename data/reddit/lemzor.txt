Well if you compare the adoption of both + energy consumption.. btc isnt in a good spot against fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:44:02
Why should they rent it ? If an attack happen it will be from the big guy like bitmain and Co 
The threat are the big miners 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:35:58
Are you aware that LN cannot handle big transaction (not over 150usd in btc if i remember)
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:25:25
When the traders will inject their bonus ! 
Oh wait..
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:47:15
You do not either
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:04:27
Compare 2 things comparable... 
You can compare btc with : gold, euro, usd, yen.. but not stock it doesnt make any sens
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:44:19
Result is the same atm. Cannot is not so far from 99% wont route &gt; =  failing.
Maybe it will be later but now it cannot process  larger amount.
Btc maximalist dont know their own shit..

If btc keep growing like it is now it will consuMme more than 40% of global energy in 2 years.
Renewable energy dont fit to industrial exploitation lile btc.
Clean energy fit for flexible consummation like homes etc.. not industries. 
Gonna be downvoted but dont care 5min research of a little knowledge of energy is enough 
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:52:36
For btc to hit 1mil we need a new way to produice energy lol
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:39:50
Renewable energy doesnt fit for industrial activities and its not. China is still powered by 30% of coil.
Btc is tight to electricty consumption, not sure to prediction.that energy for btc to reach 1mil
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:02:07
Its almost impossible to mine in profit in europe because of expansive electricity costs...
I tried some simulation in belgium.. no way to run a btc miner
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:09:27
This is americaaaaa

Funny that people think its still possible to stay anonymous in 21 century.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:16:34
They also dumped lots of btc to finance this "war" 
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:58:34
Btc price is tight to the hashpower kind of because its benefic to mine it, more miners will join. The curve is exponential. Just watch the stats on the increase of hashpower/month. Anyway dont really expect objectif view on this point here.
@_date: 2018-07-14 06:16:06
1% a day ? Doesnt remember you something ? Bit.... bitcoo... bitcorekt !
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:17:36
You should more be concern about ibm quantum computing
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:05:06
Nop we will send rockets into space to bring it back on earth
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:30:53
Bull run of alts 
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:58:07
Ibm is ready to rent their quantum by october
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:37:17
Wait fews months btc gonna melt into alts like every year
@_date: 2018-04-18 10:47:40
No mining = no mining 
Eth is premined cause there is mining on eth but not on nano 
Sick of reading this crap about lots of cc
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:17:56
Tell that to those who bought a 20k lol 
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:33:44

You are dellusional, real estate has a return of 8% to 12% annualy. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:03:34
Nakamoto satoshi is anonymous = N.S.A 
Your welcome. 
There is a big chance that btc was created by nsa/cia
