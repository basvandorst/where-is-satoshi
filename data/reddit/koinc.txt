You should try it and let us know.

I disagree that 80% of internet users don't know how to use the clipboard. I also don't think bitcoiners fall into the technically challenged category.

It's unlikely they mined bitcoin. The victim thinks bitcoin because that is all he knows, but the attackers probably mined one of those alt coins designed for general purpose CPUs.

Bingo! Price will drop to $150 or even lower because he is probably not the most efficient of miners out there. The most efficient miners don't even speak English and would definitely not post here.

Higher the hashrate the greater the security of the blockchain. They do serve a purpose.

Someone needs to learn about mnemonics...

Good to know. I guess the price will keep going down until it reaches that level. 
Sidenote: I get a 404 when visiting your user profile.

Old means 60+. More like 70+. You know teeth falling out, arthritis setting in and so on.

No there is no such thing going on. They don't give electricity away for free in China. You just made that up.

It's not possible to guess the seed because it is a 128 bit random number encoded as 12 a word mnemonic for human beings to use. 
You can and should set a password to your electrum wallet. When you set the password the seed is encrypted with it and then written to disk. If you don't set a password anyone who has access to your computer can spend your bitcoins. That includes any program that can read your files.

They are not old though...

I'm trying to understand why he thinks accidental payments are such a problem. I've never heard of anything like this before. Why are *you* so antsy anyway? Are you his spokesman or something? Let him answer my questions.

Altcoins come and go practically every day. They get pumped up and then dumped. So which coin is the most profitable alt coin to mine changes with time. If you want to know the current state then checkout the chaotic alt coin section on bitcoin talk forums.
There are also sites like coinwarz that compare profitability.
@_date: 2015-01-09 18:35:38
I think they are saying that if you have sense you will use the scarfsense site and pay like normal people. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:01:22
If it is more profitable to mine they mine. The history of bitcoin mining hardware is replete with such examples. Among western companies you have BFLabs on record as having done that. KNC stopped selling to the general public to mine itself. Selling to the public is more time consuming, expensive and inefficient. The public is basically the middleman. Cut out the middleman and mine directly. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:14:48
Or he's trolling us. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:15:22
Electricity is actually more expensive in China than in the US. The advantage that the Chinese have is that they make the hardware so they can keep the latest and greatest to mine with and sell the older generation. It's not possible to calculate miners' costs because we have no idea what hardware they are using.

Maybe he deleted his profile. Maybe reddit's servers are crapping out.

And yet humanity was doing just fine for millenia with deflationary gold as the currency.
Deflation is bad in a fiat system because governments run budget deficits and the only way to finance that is by currency debasement aka inflation. Japan's problems are made worse by an aging population and restrictions on immigration.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:47:56
More speculation then?
For the first half of 2013 there were wild swings in bitcoin's price because China had either banned or unbanned bitcoin. Those rumours died down but bitcoin isn't exactly the most welcome thing among China's governing elite. I doubt any bitcoin miners are getting special treatment.
And before you go blaming the Chinese for corruption consider that corruption has legal cover in the US. It's called "lobbying".

What do you think bitcoin is then?
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:48:18
Why so many problems paying the correct amount? Why would people accidentally pay extra later? None of these make any sense. You copy and paste the amount to make sure you pay the correct amount. You would never send extra bitcoins to the address later. Who are these users that make mistakes like these?
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:22:54
Yes. Too much hype and not enough technical stuff on this sub-reddit.
