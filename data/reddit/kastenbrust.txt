The "state" claims the right to do things a normal citizen would consider illegal in the name of the "greater good". You just have to look at the drone program to see another example of that.

I'm always shocked how few pills actually contain any MDMA at all nowadays, I always do reagent tests for myself and friends (in my home country the tests are given out free in clubs by drug safety charities), about 95% of the pills I test have no MDMA in them at all, and even pills which are reportedly "high quality" usually have less than 10% MDMA in them. To be honest it's very easy to buy pure MDMA in crystal form online, I have no idea why people still use pills.

[The Netherlands, here's an article about the policy.](
I just realised I should probably say what else I find in pills, in the past few years I've been finding a lot of heroin and other harder drugs inside the pills.

I actually run a couple of Bitcoin ATM's near here, we have constant liquidity issues, we need investors to help, the machines are the easy part.

Normally in the Netherlands we have better pills than most places, but yeah even now foreigners (mostly Russian) are coming into the market and making rubbish, but as you said it's best just to get pure MDMA crystals anyway. Another thing appearing in pills recently is 2C-B, to be honest it's kind of a bonus but really surprises people when they experience it's effects, sometimes in a negative way if they aren't expecting it.

As someone else said it's not more expensive because they only have to spike it with a tiny bit.
