My favorite thing about bitcoin is that I can send money internationally with very low fees!

I think this promotion is too successful... the website is running slower and slower to the point that it's timing out for me.
I just picked my team too : ( Can't submit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:43:21
Ah I stand corrected : )
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:09:22
What is your site? Would love to check it out.

Great detective work! (I'm a dummy)

I'm going to take a guess here and you don't have to tell me if I am right or wrong.
I'm going to guess that you are a big fan of Peter Schiff. Don't ask me why, just a feeling.

Do you still feel that way after reading this? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:29:09
Thanks for the great explanation.

I keep seeing people talking about this. Does it mean that one can do a malicious attack on bitcoin by running full nodes with crappy network everywhere?

I am VERY interested in knowing how you got this private key.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:43:42
Wow, nice find!
I know you said you have been building a rainbow table, but how did you add this picture into your pile?

What happens if I send BTC to this address before the fork?

"It's open source" is totally an argument.
I am a programmer so therefore I can verify everything myself. There is a huge difference between code that I can very myself and code that is hidden from me.
It's like someone saying "the law is written down is not an argument for those who are illiterate". Yes, that is true for those people. However for those of us who can read it's a perfectly valid argument.

This is where bitcoins really shine!

That is Jackie Chan.

Oh no, sorry. I am going to delete this post then.

How do I find out if they create a new altcoin for this? I would like to get my hands on this new altcoin if they create it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:36:40
Good for you! People like you make the bitcoin economy grow.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:07:11
Ah, thanks for the link. I got my answer. I'm going to remove my post now.
