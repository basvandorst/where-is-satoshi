Thanks! 


Years ago I wanted to do the same thing on Freenet: a BitTorrent tracker that uses Freenet's DHT as a database backend. Anyone who fired up the tracker would be accessing the same database and get the same peers. The Freenet API is a bit more complicated, though, and I never actually got to doing it.
Netvend isn't a DHT, but the API makes it look a lot like one, so the same concept applied. Plus I really like that I can use SQL to query for information. A DHT is basically limited to key/value storage, so there's no way to make formal queries like this.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:27:13
Here's my submission: a ***BitTorrent tracker built on netvend***. Everyone running the tracker is using netvend as a shared database, so they share peers.
* 
Tested only with Deluge so far. This is my very first Python program, so I probably did a bunch of things wrong. I went with Python since the API is in Python and going cross-language would have complicated things too much.

You're an SRSer, so I understand that once your "MAH FEELS" are activated you lose all sense of proportion and reason. You're intentionally misrepresenting what I said. If you die without clean water, humanity would have gone extinct millenia ago -- all that time when virtually no clean water was available. Did you follow *any* of my links or are you as illiterate as I suspect you are?

*facepalm*. There's some real irony in that last statement since it's upside down. [6 out of 7 human beings have mobile phones]( Compare that to the 4.5 out of 7 that have access to plumbing. [Access to information so much more important]( than many of the more traditional basic needs that it comes first in poorer nations. If you're alive on Earth today you're [more likely to have a smartphone than a clean toilet and electricity]( Bitcoin is more in reach for poor people than banking.

I've poked around at the netvend API a little bit, made a couple of posts, and looked at the sources. Unless I'm mistaken, it has to trust the server for queries. Commands are signed, but the client doesn't verify the signature anywhere. Presumably the server does? Couldn't the server manipulate someone's post undetected?

I've had the same problem. I tried on several occasions to buy Scrolls, but I just couldn't get my credit card to work with Mojang. BofA blocks it or something. I've never had this much trouble with any other online merchant, so I've since given up on buying games from Mojang.

Clean water, plumbing, and electricity, since today these aren't sought out until *after* securing a mobile phone. 5 years ago and before this wasn't the case. This is the evidence I linked and these facts are not in dispute.

Another quick question: will there ever be an ability to retract or remove a post? Of course, only the person who signed the post would be able to remove it. Or what about a limited lifetime, where it automatically disappears after some timestamp. I think it would be important that information can optionally be transient.

It's a [user script]( a bit of extra JavaScript that runs just after a webpage loads. It can be used to customize any webpage you visit. To use it in Firefox you need an addon, [Greasemonkey]( Chrome has incomplete native support but fortunately there's an addon called [Tampermonkey]( that should make it work right.
The Wikipedia article I linked lists ways to get user scripts running in other browsers. I only bother with Firefox and Chrome in my personal testing, though.

Heh, I'm not sure what would be appropriate, especially since you're the one providing such a cool service. It's been 3 hours of effort, and you paid 1.30411765 BTC for the first ~2 hours (~0.652 BTC / hour). I'd be happy to accept a donation level gift in lieu of a bitcoin tip -- *bitcoin level* or whatever lower level you feel is appropriate.
I intend to continue to improve and maintain it [here](

Wow, thanks for the generous tip!
I didn't realize I was talking to the creator of bitcointip until I checked out the bitcointip source code -- in order to shamelessly steal your tip regexp. Since I'm using the same regexp I should be matching bitcointip exactly (including the easter egg). Thanks for making this awesome bot!
Before, I wasn't actually checking for verification. I was just assuming a response meant verification. This version (1.1.2) parses bitcointip's comment for "Verified" and grabs the tip amount, so it can be displayed alongside the verification.
Here's what it looks like now:
 * [Verification](
 * [Rejected](
Notice it's displaying the currency unit twice, since this is exactly what bitcointip does. :-)
Any other requests? Needed fixes?

That's definitely possible, it's just a matter of spending time working it out. I'll give it a shot.

Some nitpicking,


This really only applies to censorship and law as traditionally enforced by physical force by the state. The rules of the virtual, crypto-secured systems themselves used could still be used to implement law and censorship (to a much smaller degree). This happened to some extent on Freenet's pseudo-anonymous FMS forum where accounts with unpopular opinions would be silently snuffed by the community filters. The rules of the system itself could be considered a form of law. In the case of Bitcoin, the rules that define how the blockchain works are laws.


Unregulated *by the state*, specifically. :-) That's generally what's implied by that kind of statement anyway.

I see complaints that using an ad blocker is immoral because it cuts out websites' revenue streams. However, if your computing habits are reasonably safe, advertisements are *the* biggest threat to your computer. It could be misleading links like in this post or third party ads that exploit flaws in your browser. Given that, it's irresponsible *not* to block ads, especially if you use the same computer to do banking, file taxes, or handle bitcoin.

It's not just a speed thing, either. Humans simply don't have access to the massive amounts of energy needed to perform the crack.
If we gave ourselves a million years to do the job, simply iterating over a a 256-bit keyspace, under ideal conditions [requires a constant power source of 1x10^34 GW]( Brute forcing a 256-bit key will always be outside the capability of the human race. The energy requirements of iterating over a 128-bit keyspace are still well beyond human capability anytime soon. That's Dyson sphere kind of stuff.

If we're assuming a quantum computer will be able to compute a private key from a public key then we should also assume that it can compute the original seed from a public key. Therefore generating multiple keys from a single seed wouldn't offer any additional protection.
Also, between the time you publish your transaction and the next few blocks are found, your address would be vulnerable to a quantum computer. Bitcoin would already either be screwed or moved past this issue, so it's really not something to worry about right now.

Yup, the bitcointip bot keeps track of tips by the comment's thing id (part of reddit's API). The consequence of this is one tip per message.
@_date: 2013-05-06 03:01:48


This is incorrect as far as bitcointip is currently implemented. Every reddit account has its own unique bitcoin address. When one redditor tips another, an actual bitcoin transaction is made by the bot between those accounts. The bot's verify comment links to the transaction on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:48:28
Yup, proof-of-work is [a 20-year-old concept]( that's been attempted with e-mail [a couple of times]( with no success.
The problem is that the computing cost needs to be low enough to be reasonable for low-end hardware to compute in a short period of time, but also high enough that a moderately-dedicated spammer can't just throw a couple of GPUs (or even a botnet) at it and keep on going. No such cost exists, especially not for SHA-512.
