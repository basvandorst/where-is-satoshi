Thank you my god. None of the bit coiners realize a thing about economics or finance. In fact, I came here to troll these fucking idiots, and seeing this warmed my heart. Thank you so much. &lt;3

No, I understand supply and demand. Thats the probably most rudimentary concept in economics. Thanks for answering my question.

They may be annoying to you, but you should read "Irrational exuberance" by Shiller, or any finance book about SAP (speculative asset price) bubbles.

Look, no offense, but why is it worth 9K? If it was worth 1K a year ago, and it went up in price to almost 20K, why is it worth that? There has been no change the the underlying (bitcoin) as an asset. People have just bid the price up. I know its value is derived from the technology, but there has been no change so why is it worth more at one point than another when its function as a currency hasn't changed? I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm honestly trying to understand all of this better. Full disclosure, I know a lot about finance and do a lot of investing in financial markets, but have never touched bitcoin.

Thank you for answering my question! That would make sense, it seems like it has been manipulated the way it moves but that definitely explains a lot. Thank you!

Price. Thats really cute. You must be so intelligent. You are right, a currency must be a store of value, unit of account, and a medium of exchange. So there we go, it is seen as a store of value. Although, if you brought $2.00 to the store to buy some milk, and after 15 minutes your $2.00 was only worth $1.15, you would consider that to be a pretty shitty currency. The same applies for bitcoin. Gold and real estate are stores of value. But I will accept that answer. Thank you.
