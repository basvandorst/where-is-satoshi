I think the keyword is hacked. Unless they hacked their way into a safe...

Bit of a whoosh there buddy.

Why does importing a private key take several minutes in the bitcoin-qt client?

All of their money.

144 BTC and 100 were entrusted to me by a friend because he wanted to get into cryptocurrency. I haven't told him what happened just now though he has been updated all this while. I don't know how to.
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:15:57
That really doesn't make much sense. Bigger pools are more popular because there is LESS variance and "luck".
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:52:13
I have since told him that the mtgox.com is down with a blank page and the general sentiment that its gone for good except for a few hopefuls. He said that it was a lot of money to lose but he understands and hopes for the best. We're meeting up for a couple of drinks tonight.
It was the best reply I could have asked for and I regret ever asking him to invest in cryptocurrencies and worst of all deciding to cash out via mtgox.

What happened when all the gold is mined? Gold can also be lost over time (used up in spacecraft, lost in vaults for a long term etc). The value of the remaining gold/bitcoin will appreciate if there is a demand.
Also, nothing is set in stone. For example, dogecoin was originally intended to be fully mined in the near future but the code has since changed to allow small amounts of doge to be mined indefinitely.

When you spend coins from your wallet, you will need to enter your password. This password can be intercepted in the future (or even during the first time you encrypted your wallet) via a keylogger or trojan.

Most miners are active on forums and there were many warning posts everywhere regarding this and encouraging miners to switch to other pools. Some miners listened and mined elsewhere.  At the same time, GHash.IO also stopped adding power. The drop in this pool's hashrate is not controlled by any foundation but a result of community action and responsibility on the part of GHash.IO.

Awesome, Reddit should be happy about their decision :D

Unfortunately for many people, having their own bitcoin wallets on their PCs is just about as bad as keeping it under their mattress.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:00:07
Even if you outbid it, you're not going to get rid of it. It will just appear proportionately less often.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:45:35
Better in what way?
@_date: 2012-01-18 10:06:34
Of course not. Because Bitcoinica is responsible for paying out to him.
@_date: 2018-11-11 06:40:22
Bitcoin comes out top since I don't have to deal with people shrilling it with no evidence to back up their claims.
Why is Monero more "secure"?
How it is more fair with mining?
How does the team "work very hard" to keep fees low?
Why is unlimited supply better than Bitcoin's model?
@_date: 2012-01-19 01:53:51
That's not how shorting works. Shorting is a bet placed against Bitcoinica, just like in Forex. Just because you shorted 100,000 BTC doesn't mean someone else has to long 100,000 BTC to fulfill your order.

You can always offer it as some form of a sign up rebate code after a purchase. Have your customer click a link to visit a website to enter their wallet address for retrieval.

Guys who are "losing" mhash because of this update, its because the 2~3% patch has not been applied to the kernel.cl for Phoenix (phatk/polbcm). Just reapply the edit and you'll be back to normal.

You press send when you need to send money. You give other people your address when you need to receive money.
Does your dementia afflicted grandmother understand how the USD works?
@_date: 2011-06-25 04:27:12
No offense but my mining rigs are producing a fair amount so I can just sell them on TradeHill and pay the 45 USD whenever I want to transfer around 1000 USD out so 70% of the market rate would not be good for me. I was just looking for an alternative that is maybe 5% lower than the market rate but would allow me to withdraw more frequently.
We should really setup an SG bitcoin community though!

TL;DR Who knows
@_date: 2011-06-26 02:44:13
Considering that IE's market share when it comes to browsers, no its not really acceptable if it doesn't work in IE.

What has this gotta do with being Atheist? Anyone who doesn't want Catholic prayers in their block headers should just stay away from Eligius though I personally couldn't care less.
@_date: 2011-06-23 16:07:23
Indeed, it is so small that nobody knows about bitcoin except for a handful of my friends who are all trying to sell bitcoins unfortunately...

You cannot do arbitrage trading when one of the exchanges is unable to accept deposits.

Perhaps they do but when I made the post I was more concerned about using less energy, rather than simply less energy than banks.

Though after you've won it the first time, the odds of winning it again is just 64000...

No more? :(
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:21:23
That sounds reasonable. Thank you for your insight.

If its a donation, there really is no risk either

It is not backwards, this is how currency exchange is always listed.

I can't help but feel that that this whole mining thing is pretty toxic. We're wasting energy to out-muscle other people who are also wasting energy. Surely there is a more elegant and "green" way to do this. I don't know what that entails but I hope we see it in the future.
