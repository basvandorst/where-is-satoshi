Ummm...she makes no sense.
"But Bitcoin does not solve the space issue in the long run. Servers are needed to save them, and as more Bitcoins are created, more servers will be needed."
The blockchain is like what, 16GB?  That is a record of ALL BITCOINS EVERYWHERE, and EVERYONE with a full-node wallet has a copy of THE ENTIRE CHAIN!
You don't need ANY servers!  But you do need miners - always.  She obviously doesn't understand it at all.

oops I totally missed the satire.  DOH!  I feel like a dumb shibe.

I'm surprised they did not derisively refer to BTC as "magical internet money"...

I don't see this making a difference.  There are lost coins in every currency.  A 10K block reward is peanuts.  Any anyways, the developers could always modify this in the future if it became a problem.
By the time they get to those block rewards, you are talking many many years...

I also am inclined to believe the theory that Mt. Gox "lost" its keys to the cold storage.  It's the only thing that makes sense, but why not just SAY SO?  That is what does NOT make sense.
This is also worth reading (if you have not)

Oh yeah - you are right!   Just checked the block chain schedule at 
Looks like an easy calculation - I will do it myself next time!
