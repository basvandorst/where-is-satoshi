Nice straw man.  I didn't say that we should legalize fraud.  I said that we shouldn't create new regulations for Bitcoin exchanges.  If the operators of a Bitcoin exchange defrauded customers, I would fully expect law enforcement to arrest and try them under *existing* fraud laws.
Read the title of the OP.  He doesn't say anything about allowing fraud.

@_date: 2014-03-06 01:18:27
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
My point is that we'd have lots of US exchanges to choose from if they weren't regulated here.  Some would be run by bozos like Karpeles and some would be run by people with a track record of successful business execution.  Some of the good ones would bend over backwards to provide evidence of their trustworthiness.  I'd do business with those exchanges.
However they don't exist because the US won't allow them to exist.  Instead we're stuck with exchanges in countries that don't regulate but also don't have good teams building exchanges.

I tested some transactions.  It works.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:18:52
It didn't prevent people from putting money into mtgox at all.  You just had to wire it in.  You could also wire it out until the regulators shut that down.  Guessing more than a few people had their USD stuck there for this reason.
It did prevent professional, experienced teams from developing US exchanges that would be been save to leave funds in.

If there weren't regulators instead of blindly trusting that exchanges were being run correctly there would be pressure for them to provide **strong evidence** that they are.  I wouldn't leave money in any exchange that didn't prove ownership of bitcoin or use some other system like multisig.
There are many examples where regulators don't protect us so we figure out how to mitigate risk ourselves.  For example, there aren't regulators protecting us from STDs so instead of jumping in bed with just anyone we build trust by getting to know them and ask them to provide evidence (STD tests).

These are analyses of the hardware required to run a node.  They don't include the number of operators willing to operate nodes at given block sizes.  They don't include the risk of compliance with regulation given a certain block size.

Satoshi disagreed:
*Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.*
*Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled 
networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be 
holding their own.*
How was he mistaken?
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:54:17
If you're going to appeal to authority (Satoshi) you should read his writings. He expected that only miners would run full nodes, within data centers.

What makes you think lightning hubs won't be targets for regulation?
There is a strong incentive for lightning hubs to be highly connected (thus "hubs"). 
They're perfect targets for AML/KYC, just like Ripple gateways.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:37:59
His statement that running a node would require "server farms of specialized hardware" makes it fairly clear that he expected a high degree of centralization, but that it wouldn't break security.
Unfortunately, the current discussion is nearly always focused on whether block size will cause centralization, not what level of centralization is acceptable.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:48:10

The primary defense against censorship is the cost of an attack. Attacking nodes in data centers has a potentially high ROI, because they're easy to locate, you can coerce the data center operator and presumably you would be able to remove a significant fraction of the network's full node capacity.
Tor might be able to help solve this problem.
Owning your own equipment might help.

I suppose there may be a partitioned network, one regulated and one that isn't.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:29:25
There are thousands of fungible Bitcoin nodes.
There will be very few Lightning hubs, run by known identities (companies most likely).
If a single Bitcoin node is shut down you just connect to a new one.
If a hub is shutdown, all payment channels with this hub get closed and users have to open new channels.

What we need is a bank account that lets you deposit and withdraw in USD but store in BTC.  This includes direct deposit (your paycheck) and your debit card.  The deposit part is easy as you're really just acting as an exchange, not sure about the debit card part.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:04:01
Right but the exchanges have terrible lag and are often down. Also, the volatility while waiting for blockchain confirmation puts you at risk of giving significant discounts.

This would be awesome when combined with a Coinbase Visa card.  Store in BTC, spend in USD for merchants that don't accept BTC.  Eventually merchants figure out that they can accept BTC directly from Coinbase and cut out the fees.

If you sell 25k at market you won't get $125 for all BTC.  You'll likely get prices between $125 and $110 as you drive the price down.  If you immediately rebuy at market you'll buy between $110 and $125.  So basically you just paid %1 fee on all of those transactions for no gain.
@_date: 2013-09-01 05:14:52

Yes I agree that the merchant could immediately sell at market upon receipt of the coins but this exposes them to an hour of price volatility (if they're going to wait for 6 confirmations).  Maybe the reduced fees justify this risk, I don't know.
The other risk is that mtgox is down or laggy.  Unfortunately you can't predict this ahead of time (due to 6 confirmations)

I don't understand why you have to create more money to "satisfy the demand" for it.  There are 350,000 satoshi for every person on earth and the protocol could easily do a "stock split" if needed to serve as a unit of account for things that can't be priced by 1 satoshi.

Because they have to pay for expenses in USD.  Say they sell a drink for $10 and that $8 goes to their expenses.  If 1 BTC is $10 when they sell the drink but drops to $6 by the time they have to sell to pay expenses, then they can't pay their bills and their business shuts down.

If Bitcoin becomes the primary medium of exchange, online merchants will have an incentive to keep their bitcoins rather than convert them as they'll have even lower fees.  Once this happens we'll see it become a unit of account (things priced in BTC instead of USD).  Once that happens volatility will drop and we'll use it as a store of wealth.  At that point it's money.

4. Partner exchanges BTC
5. Partner wires from exchange to bank account

This would let you easily import one address at a time if you wanted to move coins from cold to hot but I figured it's probably safer to do the tried and true method than write my own (although you could pretty easily verify that it works).

This isn't a good sign IMO:

It shows a huge selloff of 25K bitcoins.  You can't do that quickly without crashing price.

That's my guess.  They probably can't get an account with a traditional bank so they went with internet archive but then somehow managed to piss them off.

I'm sure bitaddress.org is on the up and up but why not use Satoshi client on a machine that never touches the net?

I received the same email

How about any detailed technical description.  All I've seen is a bunch of flowery talk about how great it is accompanied by hand waving.

They could only write reviews if they actually bought something from the vendor.  See "amazon verified purchase"

Why would you approve new accounts if you knew it would take you to 10x load which you knew you couldn't handle?

Is there a Ripple paper that describes how it works?  I've looked but haven't been able to find one.

Growth is the important metric, not total volume.  If it keeps growing exponentially, then volume will eventually be large:

Right there has to be enough liquidity at exchanges before you can use it as a payment network.  Once a price is established its utility as a payment network should causes prices to increase.
I don't know why bitcoins we're originally valued.  Maybe speculation of future value or maybe people just wanted to own them as collectors items.

I'd guess that prices will stabilize once people have a better understanding of the value of Bitcoin.  This includes resolution of the potential outstanding issues.
In the mean time volatility will be an issue for some applications (unit of account, store of value) but not others (medium of exchange).  If the useful applications that aren't affected by volatility become commonplace I'd expect volatility to decrease.

The long term trends is likely sigmoidal, not linear
