The problem with boomers isn't that they are wealthy. The problem with boomers is they aren't doing anything productive with that wealth.

Something has gone very badly wrong. The world economy is being driven by government fiat.

Digital gold, virtual currency. They are interchangable as long as they make sense in the context. Digital currency and virtual gold doesn't really make sense but isn't exactly *wrong*.

It would be less about changing how Russians use currency and more with how it protects them from any single sanction by another nation. If Russia decouples their currency from their economy the less pain other nations can inflect on Russia via economic policy. Once Russia doesn't have to worry about economy related sanctions it opens up their options for reaching outside it's boarders.

They could back their currency with it. Boom ~~communist~~ commodity backed currency. They might be trying to make their currency deflationary which would increase it's strength in the world market.

I like that it was a compromise that didn't break the market.

I called out the mods with a message to the mod group for limiting my comments a few weeks ago. So I was on their shitlist.

Just like r/bch masquerading as r/btc
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:36:33
BCH isn't failing. A lot of people like it, including me. But in a sense it failed because bitcoin wasn't destroyed. It's unfortunate that bch is associated with anti-Bitcoin fud. I was participating in discussion there because I truly wanted to see some pro-bch content but it's all anti-bitcoin content unfortunately.

Valid point, this is the point that bitcoin can actually fail. And that's good because if it doesn't fail it will have survived the strongest attack against crypto currency *to date*.
This is historic. Hopefully we're still talking about a decentrilzed Bitcoin a couple months from now. Segwit2x is so half brained it's scary.

Because it forked off the main chain and presumably took it's problems with it. I like Bitcoin cash because it allows people to put their money where their mouth is. Because it's shown us that players like Roger ver aren't interested in bettering Bitcoin otherwise they would prove it with Bitcoin cash and yet they still haven't tried to promote bitcoin cash without bashing the main chain. The response at regarding Bitcoin cash is more telling than any censorship war could ever tell. Their interest is to take over the brand. Period. Not to improve the chain, not to build awareness about bitcoin.

To be honest, if you want cues for when to buy the answer is always now (as long as you have the means). Selling should align with your personal goals. Getting advice from strangers on the internet on when to sell will never align with your personal goals.

I need to start picturing what my grandkids might ask about these dips? Why did I buy? Why did I sell?
And hopefully I don't have to tell my imaginary grandkids that I sold because I doubted the most disruptive thing to happen to trade since the advent of currency some 10s of thousands of years ago. 
If I have to tell my grandkids that I sold because I doubted the technology I'm either stupid or a liar.

Holding long is literally what the most successful investor in the history of investing does. Not to say it's the only strategy, and seeing your holdings tank 50% is difficult. But using TA to guess market reaction is beyond hokey. I *feel* retarded when my holdings are tanking and not taking action. But selling would turn that feeling into a reality.

 &gt;Warren Buffet is a value investor looking at intrinsic value, and purchases companies through a holding company of which he owns majority shares. This is not remotely comparable to buying bitcoin, or buying any currency or commodity. 
I wasn't comparing investments (Bitcoin vs. Berkshire) just the strategy. Basically, if you aren't willing to bet on whatever you are buying, then why are you buying in the first place?

I keep jumping back and forth. I'm leaning towards doing nothing but then again these hard forks are almost cryptos version of a dividend. I usually have my investments re-invest dividends automatically.
The other part of me wants to see the class action lawsuit against coinbase for not paying out dividends to the people that own them. I'm willing to risk losing my BCC just to be part of that shit show.
