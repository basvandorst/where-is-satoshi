Decided to give  a try after hearing about free pizza yesterday. I figured it might be a hoax to draw customers in but I couldn't turn down a piece of the action.
I initially deposited 1 btc. Just enough to mess around with but nothing that would break me if I lost it. Started with small bets and after losing I would increase to bigger bets. I was playing with a 90% chance and 1.1x payout. I managed to get up to 2.5 bitcoins but then I put it all back. Somehow I lost two rolls in a row betting 1 coin each.
I went for a cigarette to calm my nerves after depositing 5btc into the account. Came back and used the same strategy. I got up to 9.26btc and had to cash out. I couldn't take the heat anymore although I probably could have kept going. (that's the gambler's mentality)
Put in a withdrawal request and it was sent within 30 minutes. Dean, the admin, is also responsive on chat to keep you posted. Very helpful to have active site admins. The only thing I would like to see would be an affiliate program or an automatic trading bot. The site is beautifully designed and easy to use. None of this lagging bullshit when you place your bets like so many other sites.
I recommend this Casino Dice but as always please play responsibly. I won 3.26btc which is just shy of 2,000 at today's price. Today is my birthday and it must have made me lucky. Just because I won, doesn't mean you will. Keep that in mind.
Thanks again!
