Upvote for the bender reference. But downvote for the lack of attempting to understand. Hey, at least you're back to even.

I'm in an awkward spot of kicking myself. I was in a position to buy 6k worth of GHS mining equipment one month ago before this explosion and this subreddit advised me against it. It would have paid itself off in 1 week with the rate increase. 
Now I can buy 6 whole btcs. :/ And I have to worry about a much larger risk.

This is the part that does not make sense to me. 
Why would one not take into account the value of the BTC?
[I made this excel sheet to help illustrate my example - Crap, that highlighted field is $25,053](
Back when btc was 193 a pop @ 390 difficulty and I was planning on getting in with 60ghs butterfly labs miners that were all over ebay, the machines were 1200 a pop if you were patient, and averaged about 1500 each. 
Now, because of the explosion of the BTC price, the machines  are about $3000 each.
If one ignores including the equipment as part of your overall worth, eg., selling the assets for profit, accounting 101, then sure it's not profitable. But that equipment is worth money, and that equipment's value also fluctuates with BTC. I
f one were to have bought 4 60ghs mining rigs for $6k, they would currently have 9k in profit (vs 27k from buying BTC) but 27k in total value if you include the cost of the machines. 
Another interesting thing is that period between november 17th and november 29th. If the BTC hadn't exploded, then the profit of your 6k in purchased BTC vs my mined BTC would be almost equal. Then I would win out with 15k worth in equipment that I only paid 6k for. 
I feel crazy looking at these numbers, but having a liquid asset like miners which generate BTC at a reasonable albeit slow rate to get to the same end seems like a much safer alternative than dumping money into something everyone is afraid will crash.
If BTC is a bubble a LOT of us will lose money fast.

Neither is a dollar bill worth a dollar boss. A fiat is a fiat is a fiat. There's very little difference between the fact that bitcoin is represented by code and a dollar is represented by a piece of paper. (The main difference being that it's harder for people to wrap their head around the concept of a virtual fiat.)
