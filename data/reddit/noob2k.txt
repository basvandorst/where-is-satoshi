USA prints trillions a year in currency and debt instruments and sends them overseas in exchange for real physical products and resources which do not benefit the people nearly as much as if they were to use the products and resources themselves. With the death of the US dollar America will be forced to export physical products and resources to exchange with others rather than debt and IOUs. This will come at a huge cost for America as the people are enjoying an incredibly high standard of living and access to credit despite their nation being plagued numerous massive social and economic issues.

As Ludwig von Mises so rightly said: "There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion. The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion, or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved."
The federal reserve and their untethered monetary expansion has brought with it the largest and most unsustainable credit boom in history. When the dollar decoupled from everything except for the cotton it's printed on in 1971 every single metric of human expansion went vertical. Although great for our standard of living it's completely unsustainable and has come with great environmental destruction and resource waste.
We will be going back to sound money within your lifetime and whether it's voluntary or the result of a catastrophic implosion is irrelevant to crypto, either way we win, just one option is a lot less painful.

scaling issues that will eventually be resolved
I buy and sell virtual goods and my company recently stopped using bitcoin on anything less than 500$ because of how slow and expensive it became
hopefully it can be fixed soon

Wall St can literally print money through their exclusive access to the federal reserve, if they wanted the bitcoins they could take them with ease.

This is true but bitcoin isn't exactly a large market for them to profit from
The the global realestate market is worth well over 200 trillion, the banks and other wallstreet corps are currently getting money for near zero interest rates fresh from the federal reserve and using it to buy up any any every housing unit they can get their grubby little hook nosed hands on. They then rent it out and rake in 8%/year profits on a near risk free zero interest loan. 
There's bigger fish out there and bitcoin is just a minnow in the pond right now not even worthy of the attention

coinbase is antibitcoin
use quadrigacx or localbitcoin
although neither are apps for phones they are websites only

its fine for the USA where you can meet with locals armed and kill them if they attempt to rob you, but in most places it's illegal to carry and a legal death sentence if you do

Fiat money encourages massive overconsumption because if you don't spend it now it will be worth less and less. Fiat money also requires a continual expansion of debt which is future consumption at the present. 
Literally one of the most touted arguments in support of inflation is that without it people would hoard money and not spend it on goods. Nothing is more better for the environment than savers and unspent money.

Jewish fiat overlords are scared and rightfully so. 
I thought the 2016 election was enough to make everyone lose faith in the media

And what's wrong with that? Before the fractional reserve system the average worker could afford almost everything they need a loan for by saving 1-5 years. Back when my folks were young you could buy a decent home for 1-2x the median salary. It's now 10x. with both working.
All this debt has juiced everything but incomes
