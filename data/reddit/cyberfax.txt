This could be an interesting application for nextgen cryptoplatforms like ethereum and MaidSafe. Maker nodes could be decentralized autonomous corporations trading with each other, and the digital design files could be stored on the SAFE network or the ethereum swarm.

My experience is the opposite. I know people even in their 50s and 60s that come up with great creative ideas, and they've always been like that, the main thing that gets worse with age is memory, not creativity. 
It seems to me that there are many reasons that people get stuck in a certain way of doing things, usually its not really that they have lost their ability to think outside the box. It can be that they're making a lot of money on something made in a certain way, they're lazy to investigate new paths, they don't feel they have time to learn something new because of work and kids or that it's they've invented something great that is connected to their reputation, and they don't want to stray from that. 
When I think about less creative people I know, who are now in their 30s, they generally weren't all that creative in their 20s either.

Where was this, Moldova? Most places I've been they take card everywhere, even small temporary booths that don't have machines often have something like iZettle to take payment with an iPad

My bills arrive directly to my online bank and I can pay either through a mobile app or on the web. Recurrent bills like utility bills I can easily set up to be paid automatically, even through the mobile app. I'd think that's much more convenient than having to go to a store to pay it and getting annoying paper bills in the mail.

I haven't read through the entire article, but it looks like it is only talking about distributing coins and the period before all/most of the coins have been distributed. 
The whole point about having an alternative to proof of work is that once all/most of the coins are distributed, a system that doesn't use proof of work can have lower transaction costs with the same amount of security, given that the system works. While it has yet to be truly proven that it can work, I don't think it has been disproved either.

I had the same problem. Digital bills or bank statements are not accepted. Sending the PDF downloaded from the bank or whatever directly is a no-no, because when you open the PDF you can see that that its only digital document. If you print and scan it on the other hand, the PDF looks like a scanned paper and everything is okay. These laws are rather ridiculous.

What do you think of this guy's arguments?
