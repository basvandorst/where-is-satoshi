My buddy showed me this great organization that helps provide clean water to those that need it.

Yep! I have a recurring purchase on my account for $100 every Friday which currently is ~.02 bitcoin. 
Here is an article that will explain more. 
But it is a common misconception that a user will need to buy a full coin. You can pretty much buy as much or as little as you want all the way down to the smallest amount 0.000000001BTC

I mean its not as noticeable however when you look at the possible future growth the returns can be immense. 
Sure my .02 may be worth $100 now, but if BTC is 100K, that .02 is now worth $2k. Better returns than the stock market and the tech is just too awesome to not be involved.

When was the last time you cleaned the inside of your PC Case? Mine gathers dust quicker than i would like.

You don't need to buy a full coin. Buy a fraction.
