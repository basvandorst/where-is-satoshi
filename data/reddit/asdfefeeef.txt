You know what, I can explain it to you over and over, but I can't understand it for you. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:04:32


True, and I may have stressed this too much. The main point I was trying to make was not about the actual price being too high, but the volatility being WAY too high. Volatility is only good for traders; everyone else suffers.
So, volatility is one reason why I won't put in my short (I have much better positions to short anyways). Another being that I simply do not trust a single BTC broker or exchange out there. I've seen too many people have their money get caught up in red tape when a broker goes under overnight and only get back pennies what they put up to ever take the risk with a broker I don't have 110% confidence in. 
As far as maturity in buying is concerned, I must concede there are people who are much much better at explaining this concept than me. I would suggest anything written by Benjamin Graham as an absolute starting point for more on this. Also, I want to stress that if you're buying bitcoins and -immediately- using them to purchase something, then you're not who I am referring to. I do feel that purchasing things in this way is a little silly, seeing as you and the retailer have to jump through several conversion and exchange fees which only adds to the cost of what you're buying. I'll just try to put it this way: there has always been a better time to buy bitcoins, and you will probably get a better chance to buy bitcoins tomorrow. Seeing as they don't offer a yield (now or ever), there is no reason to purchase them early, or hold them when you're expecting to see several points of loss. If you're buying now expecting to sell during the next bubble, you are incredibly immature, and this is why so many people jokingly say the motto of BTC should be 'in bubble we trust'.

wow, I'm definitely staying far away now. even the supporters can't give me a valid reason to purchase. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:39:16
so are you saying liquidity isn't necessary to have long term stability? I really want to hear your thoughts on this, because I can't see it any other way. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:00:51
against what?
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:57:48
I'm talking to about 7 different accounts
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:54:57
weekly chart implies this is completely uninvestable. people who love a security 'at any price' also implies immaturity, so I guess that does make you 'one of the guys'.  
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:15:28


I get the feeling I have more experience in security analysis than you (even if it is amature, I've been doing it for a while), so yeah, I feel pretty confident in saying the long term price action of bitcoin makes it (currently) uninvestable. And, furthermore, you took the bait I cooked into the post and ignored the real point I was trying to make: people who are willing to buy a security (a trade mechanism is still a security) at any price are immature buyers. clarkmoody charts imply the market is FULL of immature investors.  Read. A. Book. I have some recommendations for the layperson if you want a start. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:48:26
and you know what, you guys are doing a really shitty job at keeping your currency stable. you all flip out about how rich you got but you ignore the fact that this currency just goes through bubble after bubble with no attempt at control. One of the most immature markets I have ever seen. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 00:16:27
"You really don't seem to understand how markets and economics work."
"Pump and dump is a form of microcap stock fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock **through false and misleading positive statements**, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. "
publicity is key for market manipulation.
another interesting part from that article:
"During the dot-com era, when stock-market fever was at its height and many people spent significant amounts of time on stock Internet message boards, **a 15-year-old named Jonathan Lebed showed how easy it was to use the Internet to run a successful pump and dump.**"
no offense dude, but you're a moron when it comes to trading. ok, I guess I did mean that offensively. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 23:23:38
no one outside of the winklevoss really hold enough BTC to do it properly, and instead they're opening up a btc etf to further inflate the price. I understand that the space is already full of traders, but they are all small time guys pushing around 15K. my point was until we can get some sizeable bank accounts attempting to close the spread, we don't have a asset class worth owning. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:20:21
not really, it would be a fantastic way to make money.
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:19:59
lol, good try
@_date: 2013-07-08 01:48:48
actually you're the one who can't read, I specifically made this post to point out you are not the only buyer in the bitcoin space, and lots of people who are not you bought at 150+. 
you know what man, I'm just going to drop you and let the future price action speak for itself. I'm calling it here: bitcoin holders are idiots at any price level. 
see you in 5 years. I expect you to be in about the same position you are today. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:23:44
"No amount of "encouragement" is ever going to move a free market."
now this...this is something else. since you're ignoring the fact that the price of bitcoin has moved quite a bit in the last few months (most of it being from a publicity campaign, think back to reddit user bitcoinmillionaire, that guy was just one of many shills encouraging people to buy now and sell later), I'll just say that its very possible for any market (free or not) to be pumped. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:55:31
well as far as I can tell there hasn't been a 'bad' time to buy USD. If you can give me some specific examples when holding USD turned out bad (especially for the layperson), I'd like to see it. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:37:54
well, because its not all about you. there are other people who have different goals with their money, not always being 'let it sit in an account for 10 years' or 'trade it back and forth'. There are a -lot- more things you can do with money. I go back again to immaturity in bitcoin users: you fail to look at how bitcoin fails in several aspects, and only focus on what's working for you.
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:35:20
and specifically what they do:
"The market makers provide a required amount of liquidity to the security's market, and take the other side of trades when there are short-term buy-and-sell-side imbalances in customer order"
however, you -need- to understand the importance of liquidity in a currency to understand why market makers are needed, especially in a market like bitcoin where a few people stepping away from or into the market can cause mass chaos. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:10:56
well you certainly don't know enough to prove me wrong. I'd really enjoy it if you could find somebody who could though. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 01:08:02
and another thing, you're not the only person. there were plenty of people purchasing BTC at over 150 dollars. I feel bad for them, honestly. those people weren't only scammed, they were fucked repeatedly in the face. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:16:01
I still don't like this example but I can't quite put into words why. I feel like the only reason the perceived value of these things goes up is solely because we have more money available, and I'm not 100% sure thats a good reason to dump usd, although I will admit it is quite the encouragement to spend it. 
I have such a hard time arguing against an inelastic currency.  It seems like such a great idea. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 00:12:17
well, technically those 'big players' are part of the BTC community, and this is about the only way I have to get in contact with them. discussion may lead to demand, and demand may lead to fulfillment. I'm not personally capable of solving any of these problems, but I like discussing them and seeing what potential solutions there are, mostly because I like to learn. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 00:42:57
ok, I understand now, you still don't understand exactly where and how you were scammed. Denial in its believers is another key necessity for the people pumping the market. You've been told an awful amount of lies in regards to bitcoin.  are you forgetting only a couple months ago how this place was chock full of people claiming bitcoin wasn't going to fall under 100, was going to keep going up, and that 200 was actually a great deal? that 'encouragement' (pump) caused even more people to dogpile into btc regardless of the price, pumping it up even more. you probably haven't seen very many of these schemes play out, but I have, and so far it has been following a very predictable pattern. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:38:20
Not interested in 'saving' something that nobody trusts. Lack of willing market participants implies lack of trust among all bitcoin holders. If you guys don't trust your own currency there is no way I will. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:05:33
You're missing the big picture. There may be more USD in existence than there was yesterday, and that is where this chart is assuming devaluation. However, there is also more of -every- currency in existence, and USD is still the strongest among them. So, no, you're not only wrong, but you're also being pumped by a gold seller. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 23:51:41
so we're pretty much in agreement? The troll post kind of got to me but I hope this particular comment gets more visibility, because clearly your understanding of the various bitcoin exchange fee structures exceeds mine. I know very little about the potential for profit in the current environment, but I do understand (I think) the need for market makers. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:52:40
you guys can downvote my post history all you want, but if you can't cut through my dirty nasty style of speech you're missing out on some great contrarian viewpoints, which, if you cared enough, you could be using  me as a tool for discussion and learning. Its very rare you will find someone willing to take the other side of an argument and keep at it with you, especially around here. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:30:04
and also, what would I be gaining out of basically encouraging people to put in large simultaneous buy and sell orders? the biggest profiteers would be the exchanges, and if you believe I represent an exchange...well thank you! thats the nicest thing that has been said about me in the thread. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:41:52
"That's why a 3rd party (you) saying that someone should step up and do it is pointless."
are you sure about that? most bitcoiners don't even know what a market maker is or does, so I hardly see it as 'pointless' to start discussion on the necessity of market makers in the BTC space in an attempt to get the currency legitimized and stabilized. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:32:04


"A market maker is a company, or an individual, that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the bid-offer spread, or turn."
how is this hard to understand?
@_date: 2013-07-08 01:03:59
ok dude, if you think everyone honestly just at the same time decided to shit themselves over bitcoin, thats your call. You're wrong, and the historical price action only supports my claims that the promoters have left the market (the MASSIVE volume spike coupled with a major correction; note how the volume barely increased before the selling began, implying the promoters picked a top and dumped their stock there), but you are free to believe what you want. 
also, if you were holding BTC sub 20 dollars and you didn't sell out +200 dollars you are a straight up sucker. I'm sorry for your potential gains but I can't take anyone seriously who gives up 10X for the hope they get even more. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 23:19:26
thats what it is! of course an elastic currency is going to lose the forex race against an inelastic currency, because an inelastic currency is designed from the start to sprint to the finish! when comparing USD to every other 'normal' or elastic currency in existence, USD is still doing just fine. 
so yeah, while your example is technically correct, I don't think it's totally fair to compare USD to nonelastic currency or commodity items. Also, I feel like the lack of  liquidity in those areas also cancels out some of the wealth created by those asset classes. basically: you often can't sell them for what you want (or even a fair value) when you -really- need to. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:27:33
nah, i just appreciate anonymity. I don't need a post history of my past viewpoints (which have been wrong before) to influence the current discussion (which, given the nature of redditors, they often tend to). I love to be proven wrong, and this is the best way to do it.
however, no one has convinced me yet. I'm open for discussion. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:09:09
wrong. competing market makers will even out the swings. if somebody wants to manipulate the price up, and somebody wants to manipulate the price down, all that will happen is the bid/ask spread will get smaller and slippage will become a non-issue. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:14:03
"Again, that requires some kind of regulation to protect against manipulation"
No...why would you think that? I don't think you fully understand exactly what a market maker does and how they go about it. You should read a little more. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:49:42
"Market makers require special privileges from the exchanges"
not necessarily, you just need enough capital to survive the swings.  although I will admit the current inability to easily short BTC would make it hard for market makers to do their job. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:16:11


and honestly...why not? all someone needs to do it is get together enough capital and trust that whatever they're trading will be here next year.
