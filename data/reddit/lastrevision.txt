What does this actually mean, though? For something to have value there needs to be an unflinching worldwide consensus of intrinsic worth... Bitcoins are a solution to complex mathematical problems? Why is that valuable? What makes this data valuable besides the fact that people say it is something of value? Is it valuable outside of it's USD$$ translation, which is the only way I can personally wrap my mind around it... But outside of 1BTC=350USD, why is this computer data valuable as translated to real world, tangible goods and services?

Thank you!

ELI5? This still is meaningless to me in explaining why data translates to real value; FYI, this is going to be a big stumbling block for widespread acceptance of BTC. The value of USD is intrinsic and universal; sure you can explain the "how, why, and huh?" but you wouldn't need to... What I want to know is why any type of computer data is intrinsically valuable on its face; what does this data represent?

But it is backed by a government?
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:11:32
What is your prediction based on?
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:30:56
How is it certain that Bitcoin is finite?
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:48:38
No battery, right? No way for it to ever get fucked up and unusable? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:06:10
Damn. I knew Coinbase was shitty, but that's really shitty. If I'm gonna transfer BTC to my own wallet, should I go through gdax first too?
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:23:54
I downvote everything. Whatever, I'm a dick. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:59:31
Really? Last time I attempted a transfer from Coinbase to Binance, it was $20 on $100 of BTC. That was absolutely ridiculous, but I was in full FOMO with Tron (yeah yeah, I know).

You know, you could have just said that. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:22:32
If you wake up tomorrow and Bitcoin hit 1mil USD are you not selling? $500,000? $100,000?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:36:30
"$1500?! I bought in at $1000! I'll wait for it to come down a bit..."- Me, two weeks ago. 
Fuck. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:45:46
I think everyone should do their thing, so I'm not trying to shame anyone. My advice is to hodl until you don't want to hodl anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:30:30
I'm a noob as of the buy-in of $1000, but my only market timing is when to buy to get the most for my money. I'm fine hodling until there is really money in selling; but by then it may very well have replaced fiat and there's no reason to "sell" as we understand it today. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:01:55
Exactly my plan; buy a bit once it falls below $2000, and more at each incremental drop.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:06:44
And hodl. Stfu and hodl.
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:41:51
Absolutely. I hold, but I still appreciate value. I have half of one, and I'm kicking myself that I didn't complete the coin at the dip.. hoping to see more fluctuation before the end of July. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:56:30
I missed the dip. I waited, thinking it would hit $1600. Now, you can say "if you believe in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what price you buy in at."
And I say, "fuck you." ;)
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:59:01
BUT it isn't instant- which is fine, if you're not looking to daytrade. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:26:11
Out of curiosity, what was the final price point where home-mining was profitable? 
I remember toying with the idea of miming at around $250, but the board discouraged me at the time- but, all things considered, with the current value, would that have been worth it? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:49:17
I'm posting on r/Bitcoin, you know we don't do that here ;)
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:34:55
Okay, cool. As long as I got my coin for the agreed upon price and all. I'm hodling until I'm cold and dead and my bitcoin is useless. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:56:06
During the last dip, I remember staring at Coinbase on my phone when it was hovering around $2050, thinking that I'd buy some once it went under $2000, so, fuck. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:48:44
I'm AFK for two hours and I miss $2400!?! God. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:33:41
Of course!
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:48:27
Awesome! (Fuck you fuck you fuck you ;)
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:54:46
I first heard about Bitcoin in 2014, when it was around $220 (IIRC); bought into the pitch, figured it'd be a good long term investment. At the time the philosophy on this board wasn't to hodl, that "Bitcoin wasn't about being an investment, it was meant to be used." Thought this was wrong. Soldiered on in my belief that Bitcoin was a solid investment.  Ultimately was too lazy to scan my license in for Coinbase. Didn't buy. I am asshole.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:54:55
Oh, I hodl, I just want the most for my money. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:52:21


Does that really take a whole lot of figuring out? lol
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:49:29
About to buy... trusting internet stranger's second hand information. Will wait for better price. Tomorrow: "fuck."
