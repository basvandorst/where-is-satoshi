Well no one is perfect and the mining contract was initiated way prior to me finding this SR

Kudo's on your display of reading prowess , by completely missing the issue.

This, along with the article below. If this doesn't scare the crap out of everyone, I don't know what will.

Wrong, reread the last sentence. As long as it doesn't render the bill unfit for reissue, you're good. This is why the where's George stamps are popular.

Yup, just wait till its over 100k each and it drops 10-20 a day.

Hopefully, I was using my CU and recently closed that account since I no longer have my house through them. So, we will see what happens going forward.

Not to long, but this was my first transaction with my Chase account. Had a couple of smaller transactions out of my CU account and never had an issue.

Chase did this to me today. SO when I called them, they were all like "are you sure you want to wire this money" "you know once you send it you cant get it back" 
Yes lady, unfreeze my account before it hit's 10.

Wasn't with coinbase but was my first using my Chase account.

Thankfully it's not in my case. I budgeted an amount to spend after the sale of my house. They had an issue with the wire in of the proceeds of the house sale.

You should of left the first name viable. I wanted to see if it was the same person. 
But LOLZ for days.

You would be shocked at how little can trigger one. Working where I do, these are not uncommon, but they are a mess when they happen. Typically they will become unblocked after the investigation is complete. Just better hope your nose is clean.

That's not true at all. In most cases there is nothing. But I can confirm that just in Phoenix alone there are over 500 business's that are participating in laundering money. Imagine on an individual level and then on a national level. That's one of the tough things with crypto is that it makes it much easier for a criminal to launder and why such tiny amounts flagged for an SAR. I would venture to bet that OP was making lots and lots of tiny transactions and slowly increasing the amounts. Once its verified that those receiving wallets are good or they deem the transactions good, it'll be released.
