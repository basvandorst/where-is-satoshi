Oh okay, I guess it was just at 0 for a while until the blocks started filling up.

Your link just showed what the current mempool is like currently, my question was rather in regards to whether or not transaction fees was something implemented recently or if it was something that was in it since the beginning since I couldn't really find anything definitive.

I thought the thing was even if they choose their own fee, if it's too low the miners won't add it to the block or something.

So was the change of view a very recent thing?  Like within the month, because from what I observed the fee only got over $10 once Bitcoin price went past $10k.  I think if I remember correctly fees were like $1 when Bitcoin was $1k or something.  But I would also think that some people would regard $1 fees as still too much for small transactions such as coffee.

Yeah my sentences are pretty long mb lol was just rambling I guess.  Yeah average transaction fees seem to be $10-20 from that website.  I've been seeing posts and on r/Bitcoin with those amount of fees.  So you say the highest you paid was 5000 Satoshis?  Isn't that like $1.  Do you have a transaction id or anything for your recent transaction?

Oh so it was this year.  Was the change of view a response to any event, or just the increase of transaction fees that made people no longer see Bitcoin as a currency?

Thank you.
I looked at  and saw that Bitcoins fees started at like $0.10 at the beginning of the year and went up to $1 around May to like $10 now.  I feel like I've been hearing about Bitcoin as a store of value for a while now not only since like May when it was at $1.  Was $0.10 too much for people at the beginning of the year that they decided to call Bitcoin a store of value over a currency?
