True. Most of their reporting subpar even by their standards.

That's right. Zebpay has sent out an email about the possible ban.

Yeah, since the exchanges have alerted the users this time.

You're right. Sadly some media and govt officials push the narrative that Bitcoin facilitates corruption. So FUD Nevers seems to stop. But Hodlers will always HODL.

Dude, price in the exchanges are different.
I'm not spreading FUD. Just sharing info to Bitcoiners. No need to be rude.

That's awesome. I do that too. It's important not to get emotional about the price swings and I find dollar cost averaging is a good strategy to cope with these swing &amp; dramatically reduces risk (rewards as well but worth it).

Overall it's a positive move for Banks &amp; Bitcoin. This will weed out bad credit &amp; people who want to speculate (nothing wrong with speculating per se) &amp; get rich quick without understanding the risk-reward.

1. As a longtime Bitcoiner and cypherpunk, what are some important books that you recommend?
2. What is something that is true that very few people agree with you?
