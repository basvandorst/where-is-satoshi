You mean Hodl

What is the engineering limitation you are referring to?
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:15:53
Bcash was just a copy paste of the whitepaper anyways, that's all they do is copy paste.  Whenever they don't copy paste, they will need Core devs to rescue them and fix their chain-splitting bugs.

Should math go back to bed too?

1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:02:29
Yeah I don't know, Satoshi was kind of stubborn from some of his posts.  He [also said users should not run nodes, and nodes should be in server farms as the system gets large](


So fuck Satoshi and his vision. He doesn't even believe in decentralization.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:26:21
I agree, fuck Roger Ver and bitcoin.com and bcash, but Bitcoin is under similar threats [from blockstream as the middleman](


@_date: 2018-08-14 05:35:25
Well you might find it interesting [that Satoshi knew about ASICs and discussed them along with GPU mining with Mike Hearn in some early emails](

It seems now there is a recent divide between ABC and faketoshi, grab your popcorn.
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:09:32
[Yeah sure](


[Here is more](


for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with
that one node.
[And this one](

You could try [wallet recovery serivices]( with Dave Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:48:17
Interesting, I was trying to follow the whole discussion but it seems really technical.  Very curious what other options you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:20:39
I am actually more worried Satoshi would dump his BTC for BCH, since BCH is more close to his vision.  But I also think his vision was wrong, and that we have the most talented devs in the world now at Core to change the vision into something better.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:24:10
Yeah maybe he would accomodate them if he saw how the network started to evolve, but he has [some other quotes that are not accommodating of user nodes either](

It sounds like Satoshi was not worried much about centralization.  I am glad we have changed the system so that nodes and users can have power to vote democratically without big corporations taking over.  Bitcoin should be about democracy, and not just an economic incentive system.

Sure, but why give him attention and credit for bcash, he is just one guy that is a dick.  There are lot of dicks in every community, better to not give them attention, just gives them more power.
@_date: 2018-08-16 09:22:25
The censorship also helped to get rid of a lot of the troll subscribers from December.
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:23:43
I don't know, seems most would agree he has done more damage than good for bcash.  So many people hate him and realize he is a dick and promoting a scam coin as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:28:34
Just get a wallet, print out a QR code, done.
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:38:41
[WeAreChange actually said Bilderberg/illuminati are involved](
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:08:42
Could you elaborate?  Do you mean network systems? Or mesh systems?
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:13:04
To be fair its not really centralized, [its actually more decentralized than Core when it comes to development](  But the problem I have with it is that they go around claiming they are the real Bitcoin and confusing people.
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:51:49
Now if we can just get back to 90% we can shut up all the bcashers.
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:26:45
Yeah but say what you want about the bcash community, but they have different teams and groups that are fighting and debating each other.  I find that sort of thing healthy.  One example is the recent debate about canonical transaction ordering.  Core may have more developer commits, but they all need to be approved by the same entity to get merged.
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:41:04
To be fair Roger actually wasn't even for bcash in the beginning.  He was dedicated to the segwit2x agreement and only shifted support to bcash once that failed.
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:04:55
Bitcoin is not really meant for those countries, its [not meant for people who live on less than $2 per day](  
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:48:22
Yes you must mean network systems.  They don't scale as a mesh, like the Border Gateway Protocol for example, without having aspects of centralization.  In Bitcoin, this is centralized as consolidated miners and pools, which allows it to scale.  This is what Satoshi was saying about how nodes will be in server farms and stuff. So in Satoshi's world users don't need to run nodes,  They use SPV instead, and the resources are consolidated into server farms allowing it to scale.  But seems like BlockStream and Core have a better vision with Lightning, and can help keep Bitcoin out of the hands of corporations, giving more power to user nodes.

Just curious why do you say pre-mine it from the UTXO set?  That does not seem to make sense. Don't you mean a ledger based fork where all non-zero addresses on Bitcoin would automatically have the same amount of coins in them as on the forked alt-coin?
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:16:51
Hi Luke, I saw this post regarding  on the other subreddit, and I was curious what your rebuttal is: 
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:48:52
Bitcoin will be inflationary forever, and the inflation rate will always be non-zero as the reward goes asymptotically to zero near the year 2140, not sure what all the hubbub is about.
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:59:16
You don't have to report anything until you sell your bitcoin for fiat, or spend your bitcoin on something.  At the point you trade bitcoin for fiat it becomes a taxable event, and would be classified as capital gains.
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:06:45
LN will reduce the transaction bloat on the chain and help reduce demand for on chain transactions which reduces the price of those transactions, or reduces fees in other words.  Its supply and demand.
