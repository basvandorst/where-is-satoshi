I agree, but specifically i mean crypto with good scaling solution and long-plan/roadmap.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:13:39
People forget that some developer will make user-friendly version of LN
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:03:00
Looks interesting, but i got "403: Forbidden". Hope you can fix this soon.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:06:23
Damn, i forget batching. But since they have lots of transaction, i think they could make 2 batching (high priority with high fees and low priority with low fees).
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:27:54
Even if all SegWit supporters decide to stop use Coinbase, they still have lots of customer.
So i doubt Coinbase will support SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:41:29
It's possible, but Bitcoin still make good profit (obviously) and it's not like altcoin holder gonna move to bitcoin just because majority use SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:19:29
No worry, Bcash supporters say HDD is cheap and biggest harddisk is about 20TB.
Also, they can use RAID 0.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:00:13
Only people with technical knowledge care about SegWit. Normal users don't even know about SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:16:07
I'm sick seeing Coinbase won't implant SegWit and batching transaction which made the network slow, so i'll sign it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:05:37
Whoa , perfect illustration. Gonna share with friends who curious about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:59:34
And don't forget to move your bitcoin to SegWit while make another transaction as well, so you can enjoy lower fees.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:39:22
Looks interesting, especially i only have 2 local exchange in my country and i don't have bank account for international payment.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:29:20
can't &amp; don't want leads to same result anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:32:31
Hmm, maybe they should have option to let user set their own fees with warning.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:14:20
Coinbase tech don't know how to add batching and SegWit support.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:36:42
I'm investing for long term, which means coins with superior technology will success and i could earn lots of profit.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:59:54
But don't forget some of his ideas are outdated (Such as SPV) or simply don't work with reality (Such as one-cpu-one-vote)
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:01:40
The hard part is find solid altcoin which isn't popular/hyped yet. Also, that means you're investing for profit while some people in here invest in technology.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:03:13
If services/wallet use SegWit by default and their default fee isn't high, we will see $1 TX fee for normal transaction (1 input &amp; 2 output) again.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:07:09
People need to learn the difference between block size and block weight.
SegWit has lower weight size which means more transaction can fit into a block if everyone use SegWit and theoretically we can see block size up to 4MB if everyone use SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:01:07
Or propose to change algorithm which can be mined only with CPU
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:42:57
Wonder if they use LN since tx fee is high and LN can help if users going to KFC regularly.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:43:22
I think you need to mention the difference between block size and block weight.
Also, the advantage of block weight with SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:49:59
The video looks like convincing, but they intentionally skip important LN details such as time-lock to attack LN/BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:05:36
If we're talking low transaction fees, many altcoin already do it. Such as DOGE.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:40:05
Come on, price rise and crash happen everyday. Also, it's obvious price gonna crash after massive rise/hype.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:50:20
If tx fee is reduced, LN would be perfect so people don't need to worry to pay high fees when open a channel.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:05:02
Waiting bitcoin nodes which located in Mars and can connect to other nodes on Earth without big delay.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:32:43
As long as community agree and adapt those technology, bitcoin will be fine.
But, people are too lazy to move to new technology and services don't want waste just to adopt to new technology.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:48:45
Oops, i forget to calculate when majority use SegWit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:05:43
Removing PoW could solve the problem (but find PoW replacement is difficult)
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:53:41
Nice info. I just remember someone share FUD about LN by "explaining" how LN works without mentioning time-lock transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:56
Don't worry since you hear that from different people.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:15:06
Or give users option between "BTC/KB" and "satoshi/byte"
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:14:03
True, especially bitcoin network can't handle the hype at this moment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:05:41
How about spend your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:14:49
Bcash supporters said Bitcoin is evil, so why they use evil's code now?
I don't mind them doing that since Bitcoin is open source, but it's a bit ironic.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:52:08
Nice, another wallet support SegWit. Wonder if it also support bech32?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:50:58
Regulated? Somebody will be triggered.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:48:16
Looks like they're supporters of Bcash, otherwise i'm sure they would chose another altcoin such as LTC/DASH.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:37:16
Interesting simulation, especially since i had doubt LN will work well for big transaction or million hubs/channel.
Also, how long time needed to run this simulation &amp; what's the spec used for the simulation?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:51:10
I've heard about Schnorr signatures few years ago, but i wonder when will we can see this technology on bitcoin?
Also i think spammer simply could make hundreds of transactions rather than hundreds of inputs (which means hundreds of signatures) if Schnorr signatures is applied.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:40:04
Nah, regular folks will think you're nerd pretend as rich guy.
That's what i see when people mention bitcoin in regular forum/social media.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:15
Really? Looks like i read old news and think it's new news.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:20:04
Only if you've done survey/consensus and the result is majority nodes will able to run after block size increase.
And obviously get majority community support, which is extremely difficult.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:13:20
Boycott isn't best words, i think sending mail to exchange to support SegWit (sure they'll notice if thousand members send similar mail) and encourage people to stop using services which don't have plan to support SegWit are better  idea.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:08:53
If i'm right, LN isn't in mainnet (yet).
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:30:46
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:53:30
How about address starts with "bc1" (BIP 173), is it SegWit with new format?
Also, are there any exchange/services which already support address starts with "bc1"?
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:17:58
Most altcoin are joke anyway, only few have amazing technology or/and good community support.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:50:29
Looks interesting
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:09:14
Actually you can, with lower fees and lots of patiance.
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:24:55
So, who is Rubini? Never heard him before.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:02:07
How many incoming connection your node have?
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:48:18
Mine altcoin and sold it for BTC, problem solved.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:28:02
With Bcash supporters logic, we also can call Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and other applocation with same protocol as "currency"
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:37:47
Because the dev/early adopter can get quick profit by pump/dump scheme, duh.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:41:23
After LN is ready for mainstream user with availability of user-friendly wallet which support LN, surely many people will forget altcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:18:45
Just need Carlos to make a ~~meme~~ speech about it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:02:11
Cryptocurrency subreddit 1st rule : Don't talk about what majority user/moderator hate.
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:29:45
How do you access ninite.com without open IE/Edge after a clean install?
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:06:38
Unexpected more neutral and funny. He also mention some altcoin, cryptocurrency terms and the potential which is nice.
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:22:20
Basically cryptocurrency community excluding Tangle/DAG/non-blockchain coin.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:58:11
But i heard they improve the PoS, even though i don't know if it's true.
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:01:16
They can use their AsicBoost for non-SegWit SHA-256 coins.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:28:04
True, but turing-complete language tend to use more resources while P2SH isn't.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:32:51
Why not boycott the fake cloned exchanges?
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:04:51
I think decentralized exchange will be the one which support LN.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:06:34
Few altcoin have different features/technology that could be useful/interesting such as Monero which offer privacy, ETH/others which offer smart contract/Dapps &amp; DOGE which offer meme.
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:40:44
No, because kinds of people who :
1. Prefer Smart Contract.
2. Hate SegWit or/and LN.
3. Want something even better than SegWit/LN.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:08:44
Looks interesting, would be great if there are simple explanation about this technology.
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:33:36
True, now exchange/services have one less excuses not to support SegWit.
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:03:19
Isn't it link for 1st edition? Since there's 2nd edition now.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:02:57
No idea about ETH, but XMR won't be replaced/have strong competitive as long as there aren't any coins which force use full-privacy option.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:13:24
Lucky bitcoin community don't agree to change PoW algorithm, otherwise i'm sure the condition will be worse.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:13:20
Just usual Double Standard in life
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:36:20
Or recruit proper engineer/programmer.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:26:51
Obviously it's exchange fault, they want profit.
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:43:02
It's ok as they use "Bitcoin" only as part of their altcoin name and don't claim as true Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:56:03
0-conf and pray miners will include your transaction. But AFAIK few nodes don't broadcast 0-fee transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:23:07
They still don't know the difference between Cryptocurrency name or Cryptocurrency client name.
