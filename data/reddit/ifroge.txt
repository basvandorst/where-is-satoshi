Holy shit. But if you take into account the dollar per watt of electricity its not as effective as mapped
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:06:35
Wow, I'm gonna invest in a couple of GPUs for a mining rig
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:17:36
Yeah dude why in the world would you wire 40k to coinbase in the first place. It's probably less likely a scam and more likely the bank freezing that money and inspecting everything thoroughly because a large sum of money is being wired to a random company that is known for anonymous currency exchanges 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:47:40
Well, shit
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:36
It's ok. Just buy and hodl, the winter will be over soon my love
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:14:10
HODL on, I'm moving to canada 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:39:57
I dont know any other good wallets. Any good ones because im saving up for a trezor
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:40:35
China isn't exactly moving away from bitcoin, they are cutting down on the mining because its damaging to the environment
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:48:00
China isn't really on the leaderboard of renewable energy sources. A large portion of their power is either coming from coal or nuclear plants
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:46:32
There are people in Siberia heating up their houses with bitcoin miners lmao. These people know how to HODL
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:32:32
I can see that with high dollar amounts. But they are shutting down my transaction to G2A. I tried to send 5 dollars for a steam key but it never went through and I contacted customer support about it and they were all good on their end
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:47:18
Didn't that antivirus guy say he would cut out his nut and eat it if bitcoin reached 10k by the end of the year?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:22:54
Holy shit that's crazy. Glad you only got off eith a fine because importing narcotics is a hefty charge
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:49:55
I dont have a miner but i still have some bitcoin I've been Hodling since September's dip
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:03:29
The economical environment
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:37:43
Dude 3k in September was crazy and then it spiked. That was the year of the nut
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:30:01
It requires an SSN and coinbase is sketchy enough as it is with people losing funds. Any way around this?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:43:26
What website was it. I'm looking for a new keyboard please pm it
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:55:29
Or you would get the swat team searching the buildings for grow ops. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:37:41
Has there been another GPU shortage because people are now realizing bitcoin is getting bigger?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:14:29
That 7k climb made everyone nut 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:23:47
4 million bitcoin to be mined but current price is 14k? That's like a bazillion dollars my dudes
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:33:34
Well some of us didn't get the memo on time
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:36:25
Take this updoot
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:35:40
I'm saving up money for a trezor or something like it so i can take my BTC out of this fuckfest that is coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:05:18
The thing about bitcoin is, its just like every other stock in the stock market. These idiots calling bitcoin retarded because we put money into this are probably the same people tossing their money into the ass crack of wall street

There is a government issued currency in cuba, GitmoCoin. Every time you get waterboarded you get a hash 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:29:29
I will admit i do hold bitcoin with coinbase but i hate them because of their shitty id verification. I have tried to verify my id for the past 3 days

Buy drugs with crypto get out with crypto buy more drugs with crypto 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:13:50
My guess is ETH is slightly more stable than BTC
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:12:42
How did you feel when you found out you were going to cater for coinbase
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:44:23
Or runescape gold. Lots of Venezuelan gold farmers
@_date: 2019-03-12 13:30:11

@_date: 2017-11-14 14:05:21
Awesome. Ill get on it
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:04:21
Yeah coinbase has really high sending fees (i think 5 dollars right now) and its eating away at my wallet
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:32
Dude want some good stuff? 1k
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:13:07
No please...dont do it...im a virgin

Shitracing is installing a bitcoin mining rig in a nissan gtr and have it mine bitcoin based off of your speedometer (crashcoin)
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:51:08
Oh, nice. Im gonna need to figure out how to do that
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:33:17

Daily eth spinner faucets where you spin a wheel and get the number you land on.
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:38:45
Coin base blocked my account for using those BTC/ETH/XMR spinners
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:23:50
And everyone and their mother pulled out of coinbase like they were about to dump a load. Almost like this subreddit knew what was going to happen����
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:43:22
WASU WASU WASU WASU WASU BEEEEEEECOOOOOOHHHHNNNNNEEEECCC
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:39:45
Steam, Microsoft, Newegg, G2A, etc. These are all big companies taking massive risks by endorsing the use of bitcoin but they do it anyway
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:15:35
This is technically busting a nut and me seeing 7 dollars in profit and then go back down the drain in 3 hours
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:57:39
He was right, bitcoin did blow up. Thanks for the 5k jamie
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:50:21
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:45:45
Mfw this is why the big banks are trying to shut down bitcoin, they want them bucks
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:24:32
So you are saying to give out my credit card to 12 year olds on minecraft?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:28:51
It's the gpu miners devaluing our superior Somalian currency

If only the government is as thorough with investigations on terrorists as they were eith 2 guys that hodl bitcoin then maybe terrorists would be less frequent
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:27:50
Id toss my bitcoin to see the price go over 8k
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:55:32
I think steam stopped accepting bitcoin right around december
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:46:43
Should have invested after china said they were leaving the scene and when it almost dropped to 2k
