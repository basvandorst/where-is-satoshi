Pegged to the price? As far as I know a federated sidechain uses real bitcoins, the trade off is that you must trust functionaries, which is ok to me for small amounts.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:28:26
Actually, it's not a bad idea lol
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:12:32
And dash. 7 out 10. And even Bcash thanks to the EDA. 8/10.

There is no database. That is the magic. You do not store anything.

There is no lightning network blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:38:50
The reason for that is a lower transaction count due big transactions being confirmed. Check the number of transactions below that graph.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:08:13
It might go, but you are at the end of a long queue, are you in a hurry?
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:04:08
Those who want to make the Blockchain bigger are those that don't want to store a full copy. Funny.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:39:42
If the decision is change or die, it will be made without heasitation, you can be sure of that.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:09:31
I think everyone would agree on the difficulty hard fork. Difficulty is meant to keep 10 minutes between blocks so a fork to achieve that is not against the protocol. It is more like a fix for a bug.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:37:40
We are talking about PetaBytes, not TeraBytes. That's why we need layer two solutions.
But the main problem with BU is not the block size nor its bugs (and those are big problems). The main problem is who is behind it and how they want to take over Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Unlimited suporters want to force the network to use their untested software whitout consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:50:58
BU is crap and Core is not against increasing the block size limit. Core is aware that SegWit allows more scalability with less risk, and is also aware that a 2MB transaction without SegWit could break Bitcoin, let alone bigger blocks. Have you readed the Core scalability roadmap?
And please, check the commits on both Core And BU repositorys, while Core is under active development BU did their crap and now their are just waiting. Core is making Bitcoin better everyday and BU can't even prevent an obvious bug.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:07:47
I don't have that position. PoW change is a nuclear weapon. But we will use it if needed. You say that it has even less support than segwit. That is true... for now. But if miners try to force that BU crap without conensus they wil be fired because they work for us and not for Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:53:14
SegWit waits to 95% signaling before activation. Thats consensus. BU whants to take over Bitcoin as soon as posible, that's an atack.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:27:06
You are right. But it still feels bad :'( That small miner did those blocks with all his illusion :‘( hahaha
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:46:44
We can create our own hard fork with:
- Repay atack protection
- New difficulty
- And the special nuclear weapon: new Proof of Work
If they want a nuclear war then they will have it. Then comunity can decide who will trust.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:38:16
Consensus is derived from what users acept. And if we don't like what miners are doing, we don't have to acept it. If they try to force us, well, we can release our nuclear weapon and start acepting a new PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:12:10
Any cryptocurrency replacing Bitcoin means there is no good criptocurrency suitable for long term savings and then why should we use them at all? Fiat scale really good.
About the voting mechanism: that is not consensus, it is democracy and we are running away from it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:15:42
Obviously. Because there is even more crap on BU and the sooner they get in control, the better for them.
But lets not forget that they work for us and we, users, are in control.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:42:52
No. They can't. Their ASIC hardware is useless if we change PoW. Thats the good part of ASIC. They are our slaves, they work for us, and they will discover it soon if they still triyng to take control.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:02:26
Maybe wee need it. But if I have to trust politics, I rather stick with cash. So I'm going to fight to keep Bitcoin free of political influence. Bitcoin is not a democracy, it is consensus. And consensus mean that we have to wait until everyone agree before we change the protocol. BU does't want to wait.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:33:19
Miners are paid to validate transactions. That's it. They are not allowed to rule Bitcoin nor to choose wich software is used. Do I have to remember that most nodes are core nodes?
This is like having some person paid to clean your house, if that person insist on telling you how you should rule your house and he take decisios while you are outside, you fire that person and change the lock if needed.
Same with miners. If they don't behave they will be fired and we will change the lock (PoW algorithm) if we have to.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:13:14
And that's exactly what Bitcoin Core offers: a safe increase in TX space which also enables the development of layer 2 solutions.
Meawhile BU proposes a buggy solution which not only does not enable layer 2 solutions but also enables the posibility of multiple network splits.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:49:09
Remember that difficulty adjustments are meant to keep time between blocks at 10 minutes, it can be manually adjusted if needed and everyone would agree.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:49:56
Shatoshi was against that. Core is one single software, yes, but anyone can participate or review the code and they impose nothing, SegWit waits for conensus.
On the other side, BU wants no consensus and they are playing dirty to get their way.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:41:39
For the very same reason they don't increase the block reward: user full nodes. The ironic part is that they want to get rid of those :P
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:10:24


Your hard fork will not happen. I support segwit precisely because is opt in. A HF to bigger blocks will happen sooner or later, but it's almost imposible to reach consensus to make changes beyond that, that is really risky and it will not happen.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:05:33
We are currently with little hashrate and slow blocks because miners are too busy taking advantage of the crazy difficulty of Bcash. Also, the biggest proponent of big blocks still mining empty ones even after more than half an hour since the last one. Why the hell should anyone trust them?. BitPay, fuck you!
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:30:32
If you are forking you should implement replay protection.
Also it's impossible to implement replay protection on the original chain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:00:20
BTC1 is not an implementation of Bitcoin since is not compatible with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:28:46
How do you know that?
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:39:07
According to this, the maximum price movement for bitcoin its the square root of its price. Do the same for the milliBitcoin price and see what happens. I think that theory is flawed.

Nope. Socialism means a mayority imposes their view. Free market means if you don't agree you go your own way. Bitcoin is part of a free market and if you dont' like it, the free market way to disagree is... to create an altcoin. Plain and simple.
On the other side, the socialism way is to force everyone in to the "common good". We know how that ends. I don't want that.
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:50:36
The thing is: you don want day 1 software to run Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:13:28
Obviously. They are really invested in Bitcoin, so much coffes and ASIC... and DASH... And backdoors...
@_date: 2017-04-16 11:40:28
I like how careful they are while writing Bitcoin's code :D
@_date: 2017-04-16 11:32:52
Sheeps need leaders. But sooner or later they will follow Mr. Consensus as their leader.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:28:59
Same with a hardware wallet. WIth the difference that the hardware wallet is much harder to crack.
@_date: 2017-04-16 14:59:19
Why? Because no one can get their way without... consensus?
@_date: 2017-04-16 11:08:43
Bitcoin user base still growing as always. Stop being scared of altcoins please, they don't offer what makes Bitcoin great: consensus.
For the first time in our history we have something that cannot be crushed by the majority.
@_date: 2017-04-16 21:23:47
I don't think so. I think at the worst case Bitcoin would be used as collateral for altcoins to have value, because no altcoin can have value by itself, they can be replaced or corrupted easily. Lets be honest: no one is going to trust any crypto if bitcoin falls.
Also, consensus is protecting Bitcoin from unknown bad things. Bitcoin doesn't need to innovate, that can happen and it's happening arround it. Bitcoin need to stay strong and inmutable in order to prove to everyone that we don't need to trust leaders anymore. Property, identity, money, insurance, bitcoin is way more than Internet magic money.

My personal experience there is that is an incredibly toxic place, full of hate, I don't like censorship (though I understand how someone running a Bitcoin forum may feel due those who try to pump their crap) so I try to read everything, but I try not to enter so much so I don't get that toxic feeling.
And of course, I barely post there even when I love debates because I get downvoted a lot and I don't use reddit a lot so I'm in "red numbers" since I tried to explain there some arguments against big blocks.

When you download the blockchain, you have to verify, and in order to do that you need to do a lot of readings from the hard drive. On an mechanical hard drive thats a bottleneck.

Well, it was a scam thats for sure.

Hash Power is just executive power. They just execute the rules, they don't get to create them.
So sorry but if we as users, agree to use smaller block size, they can follow or they can mine on a chain with no users.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:02:41
If no one is mining, users would mine. How do you think Bitcoin started?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:08:14
Satoshi never talked about making that EC crap BU is doing. But he do talked about alternative implementations:
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:03:01
Let him rest, maybe he made a mistake, nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:57:12
There are lots of things that are "feature not a bug" in Bitcoin. The scaling debate is one of them. Even ASIC is good for the same reasons showed here: you can build a supercomputer with CPU or GPU and attack Bitcoin, then still using it for other purposes. But with ASIC you can't. It also give us users The Nuclear Weapon: miners depend of us, so they better behave or they could be fired, rendering their hardware useless.
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:04:38
They can try... Most nodes will reject their crap.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:39:39
Please don't make me feel like I'm on r/btc!
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:35:13
The thing is: even if hash power were law, they don't even have a majority, let alone consensus.
Also, even if all miners agree, users are free to change the PoW or move on to another coin... oh wait, we already have Litecoin with SW and Scrypt!
Currently, I think all its needed for SW to become active is a way out for BU supporters which doesn't hurt their egos. Sad but true.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:32:58
I've been reluctant about UASF and now i'm thinking on signaling it too. It looks to me that some people are just broken and it imposible to argue with them, they think we all are on AXAs payroll... And SW is optional after all.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:18:09
No. Not the majority. If not everyone follows it is an altcoin.
In case of a fork, the true Bitcoin is that one which rules were accepted by everyone.

Bitcoin is conensus. If there are people oposing a change then that change must wait. I speak about hard forks, since soft forks don't break the rules. But the idea of someone keeping Bitcoin hostage makes no sense to me. We all have agreed the current rules.

@_date: 2017-06-28 06:55:35
Not on this case. Competition between sidechains is good. Competition between altcoins means that at the end all will be worthless (it makes no sense to put your money into something that can be replaced). Value and features are two diferent things, Bitcoin is suposed to represent value, competition should add features to Bitcoin, but altcoins try to replace Bitcoin and that gives you no value (there will always be another coin).
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:08:10
As far as I know Coinbase does not charge you the fee if you spend more than 1 milliBitcoin...
Anyway for such a tiny amount I think it is better to leave it on Coinbase and send it to you later when you have more. Aso on Coinbase you can send off-chain between users.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:02:46
Yes, because gold is so easy to move and validate.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:21:54
SewWit2x right now is in fact a miners UASF. If they think theiy are saving their face I'm ok with that. The hard fork part comes latter and we'll see how it plays out, after SW I think we can start preparing the 2MB hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:12:50
Mmm, it's true, but also it isn't: I think is going to damage Bitcoin and I wanted opinions on that regard, but I understand.

Mining is like mediation, if we want small payments wee need off-chain P2P solutions like the LN, on-chain TX are never going to be cheap for micropayments because if you always rise the block size when blocks become full, users would end  up backing their hard drives on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:48:54
