**HOLD UP**: Be skeptical, including how this conversation has been bumped so as to promote a narrative.

Hi Oliver. I wish I could trust you, but I don't. However, I do see how these other posters could be someone else trolling, I thought so myself. However, how would you even know they were posting at all unless you were, um - stalking me anyway. account reported, again.

I thought you're involvement with the candice lynn potter harassment website and evidence showing you were in cahoots all along scared you from doing this anymore? should I send this over to your mom? perhaps contact your father at work?

It is not David being critical that is the problem - the problem is the article guarding by someone who specifically is an antagonist. A critic is fine, but an antagonist has a view and sometimes even an agenda. That's fine too - but guarding Wikipedia articles with that view while also publishing "reverse hype" antagonism back on RationalWiki is where "wiki wars" are born. 
From personal experience with him, I highly disagree with your assessment of him in terms of online collaboration but that's life.
