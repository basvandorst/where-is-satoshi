IT IS CRIMINAL - AS BESIDES AUTHORITIES BLOCK SOMETHING OR CHASE OR MAKING OTHER ACTIVITY IS ILLEGAL.
POLONIEX IS ILLEGAL EXCHANGE.
AND LET BE DEAD YOU AND YOUR GENERATIONS!

and last thing that make me angry - its no reason for monitoring...actually reason is probably fbi/nsa request.
if there was tax authority.and there is no reason ... there is darkest thought coming to head.
Especially there is no official reply from poloniex.

SO FUCKING PITTY ABOUT THAT SHIT.. WITHIN 2+ YEARS OF USING BITCOIN NO ONE EVER ASKED ME TO APPROVE MY TRANSACTIONS - NOT ON COMPLEX WALLETS LIKE COINPAYMENTS, NOT ON exchanges.
Here is copy of email received from them 
Dear Nick,
The awaiting approval status is a security measure to allow a security agent to review and approve the transaction manually, this is necessary in some cases depending on how secure your account is.
Your withdrawal will be approved shortly, but some cases will require contact with the security team, in that case a security agent will reach out to solve any eventual problem with you via support ticket [
In case your withdrawal has been Awaiting Approval for over 72h and you have not received any contact from Poloniex, please reply to this message.
Poloniex Support Team
P.S this is USA GOVERNMENT DEPEND EXCHANGE - DO NOT USE IT FOR MUCH MONEYS. EVEN IF YOU ARE USING BITCOINS LEGALLY TRANSACTION BIGGER THEN 0.01 BTC subject to monitoring.
Freaking independence day to poloniex.
