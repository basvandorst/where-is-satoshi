I'm guessing not that many people have bought things on TigerDirect with BTC yet.

If I'm mathing right, that's only about an hour's worth of volume on Bitstamp right now. I'm sure it could have some type of effect, but I wouldn't put it near the top.

Wow, that's a long time. Did you not bring it up with them before now? And were the coins in your account until they reversed it, or was the whole transaction Pending during that entire time?

The last option - sale was marked as complete, then a new transaction appeared reversing the sale. I'm actually fine with having the coins back, but thanks for reaching out to me. I'll PM you if something else happens with this transaction.

It was down for me for a few minutes, but seems to be up now.

Have you been able to get in touch with anyone at Coinbase about it? Based on the time that I sold, I would guess I completed the transaction before things got crazy.

Thanks for the response. Quick question - if we don't reach out to Support, will the coins stay in our account, or will the original Sell transaction eventually go through again? At this point, I'd actually prefer to just keep the coins.

Me, too. Do you have much experience with their Support? I suppose it probably depends on their reasoning for reversing it, but would it be possible to have them redo the transaction at the original price?

Hmm... that FAQ makes it sound like their own communications with the banks was too slow. If that's the case, I would hope they would honor the original transaction, because the problem would seem to be on their end.

This is correct. I still see the original Complete transaction for selling the coins, but now also a newer Complete transaction for "purchasing" the coins back, even though I never initiated that.
Edit: Spellin'.
