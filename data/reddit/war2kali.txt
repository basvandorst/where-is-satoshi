As long as you're alive, you're wrong.

we have suggested this and i do expect them to eventually implement it. screw 24 hours tho. coinbase and similar companies need an investment type account with multiple hurdles to withdraw including signed paperwork snail mailed back and forth, phone voice verification to number on record, 7-14 day delay, etc. whatever a Vanguard or Fidelity account requires and more.

The advantages are currently on the vendor side: zero fraud and lower transaction fees. Where we will see consumer adoption is when the vendors start to make it worth our while to choose to pay with bitcoin.  1% off would spur some sales. Everyone wins.

If they can pack the house at $275 a ticket, bitcoin is well and truly "the next big thing."  That price is insane.

Ah, the irony. :)

Currently bitcoin is hard to understand and tough to use.  It's early days and it will improve and eventually be transparent to the user.  It's currently like using dial-up Internet and email in the 90s.  
"You mean I have to buy an extra modem card to connect? And I have to pay $25 a month to go online? Every time I get a phone call, I get knocked offline and I have to connect again.  Or while I am online, I can't receive phone calls?  It's not worth the trouble, this shit will never catch on.  I can just pick up the phone and call someone - email is too much of a pain.  I have to enter server names and port numbers and then my program crashes."  
For vendors, there are currently real and massive benefits - 0 fraud and much lower transaction fees.  For consumers, it's a tough sell at the moment.  The pressure from vendors will fix that, though the tradeoff will be higher fees (though far from credit card levels).

The process will improve quickly.  I'd put it at the same level as early days of credit card processing... putting the card on that slider thing and making a carbon impression, etc.  We consider that primitive now.

I third this. its a lot easier to feel good about btc if your average price is 600 instead of 700 or similar. of course you need to believe in the long term potential or you are just throwing good money after bad... sounds like you are on the fence about that.

Thanks a ton for posting, Tyler.  Good service from Google and exciting to see bitcoin enthusiasts in top companies.  
As a side note, I am really excited about Google playing gatekeeper with extensions with Chrome 35.  It was already the best browser - soon it will be a football field ahead and much harder to infect.
