I get what you're saying about "dick move" but "dick moves" happen all the time.  Do you think the guys getting paid in cash were happy to start getting checks?  Or how about getting paid 90 days after invoice?  Buyers do these "dick moves" all the time.  The alternative is for the buyers to fire people to get someone they offers them what they're looking for.    
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:06:33
so which form do we use for this bullshit?
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:24:19
They don't take credit cards.  The credit card is used only if your bank account has insufficient funds.  Or I could be wrong.

Dear young professional:
Your well thought out points have been brought up almost daily.
Here's the answer.  It's not for you.  Don't use it.  You have access to some of the most sophisticated systems of money payment currently in use.  Plus you probably don't even have to pay for them.  Now I'm guessing you aren't an accredited investor so there are some things that you can't do but for the most part you are a winner.  Cheers.
Bitcoin is for the 5 Billion people without a credit card.  Or maybe the +30% of Americans without a bank account.
That's my serious response to your question which has been asked and answered and keeps getting asked.

I have a lot of more discretionary money in bitcoin and I keep putting it into bitcoin.  Since I'm doing that I use my bitcoin for discretionary purchases.  
I basically at the point where my liquid is either USD for non-discretionary or bitcoin for discretionary.  I am more cautious about spending when I use bitcoin and I try to spend when it's higher and buy when it's lower.  If bitcoin is tanking I'll use cash.

That's an argument about degrees which is fine.  You don't think bitcoin has done enough and you're impressed with doge?  Great.  Personally I think it's absurd to say that Doge is kicking ass on publicity when bitcoin has been all over the headlines and news pretty much non-stop since October.  I'm impressed they got $50k for a back-marker at Talledaga.  It's not what I would have done and I think it's a waste but that's just me.  
Anyway I think it's already been established that bitcoin is "serious" while doge is "fun."  Whatever.  I'm happy with bitcoin.  Nothing wrong with serious.

Go to localbitcoins.com.  Register and get a bitcoin wallet there.  Search for your city.  Find someone near by who is willing to sell $20 worth of bitcoin.  Contact them.  Set up a meeting in public place.  Make the seller use escrow (I do that -- others might not) that way you know it's funded and the guy has to meet you to get his $$$.  Localbitcoin will give you a code.  Take the code with you to the meeting but don't show it to anyone.  Meet the guy.  Show him the $20.  He'll send you the bitcoin and to prove it he'll show you a code.  The code will match the code you have.  Give him the $20 and get the fuck out.

Based on the past the only problem with that strategy is when it really takes off it takes off so you'll want to keep that in mind.  I have a friend who did really well selling at $350 (be bought at $60) but he was convinced it would crash down again and it never did.

Typically people who gravitate to an alternative aren't satisfied with the norm.  It shouldn't be surprising that something that allows people increased privacy and the ability to opt out of the current monetary system would appeal to people who feel uncomfortable in that system.

Most people don't have credit cards.  Not all credit cards provide incentives.  Many credit card holders are carrying debt so each cc transaction is more expensive from the moment the charge is incurred.  
Your argument is presenting the best possible scenario for credit cards.  If you can check off all those boxes (have a credit card, no revolving debt, great rewards) then you are in a good spot with the current system.  
My reasons for using bitcoin are: I find it easier to use than a credit card (especially for merchants I haven't used before); I've benefited from special bitcoin promotions and points plans (on gyft for example); I'm trying to limit spending on my credit card because money is tight; spending with bitcoin is an easy way to realize gains; and all the philosophical hate bank//love bitcoin reasons.

Hi, I'm in sales I'm curious about the reason NOT to accept bitcoin.  For my business it was very simple -- We are B2B and none of our customers have requested it.  Right now, because of our product, we don't see how it would be worth the small effort.  That said if I get a deal next week with some real money we could start taking it right away.
For State Farm, you have a completely different business.  You are a classic B2C with commission only sales staff (I'm assuming based on industry standards).  You need to promote both to customers and potential producers.  The effort it would require to accept bitcoin vs. the publicity would be worth it and State Farm will probably be accepting it eventually so you might as well get some bang out of it.  On a very basic level, for the skeptics in you organization, you need to be clear that this is just another payment network.  SF won't hold any coins and the fee is less than VISA/etc.  You're using a reputable processor and political leaders are accepting donations.  There is no reason not to accept.  
Also you're opening yourself up to two potential classes of people.  First (and most immediately) newly wealthy people who would like to use their bitcoin, people getting paid  in bitcoin, etc.  Second (as it grows) the underbanked community that doesn't necessarily have a bank or credit card to pay for your services.  They need car insurance more than a bank account.  This is a way for them to pay you (and you know the check won't bounce/won't be a charge back).
Finally (sorry for the length) you'll be in the position to provide business lines to companies who do accept bitcoin.  If I was selling insurance now (I'm licensed and sold B2B products in the past) for a company that accepted payment in bitcoin I'd be marketing to vendors who are now accepting bitcoin.  Everyone is looking to close the loop.

Basically you get a localbitcoin wallet when you create an account.  When you make the deal you can request the seller to fund the deal before you meet.  Once they fund it you 100% know the coin is there.  The only way for the seller to get the coin back is to show localbitcoins that you failed to follow through on your end.  So the seller is motivated to actually show up and get paid.
As I said once it's funded you'll get a code like 276322.  Take that code with you to the meet.  When the seller meets you and you show him the money he just needs to send a text to release the bitcoin (telling localbitcoins it's OK to give you the coin).  None of this depends on the block chain because localbitcoin already has it.  They are just moving it between wallets.  So the seller releases it and then local bitcoin sends him a code.  The code will match what you already have.  That proves he sent the coins.  You might also get a text from localbitcoins -- I don't remember.

It's a disingenuous discussion.  He's saying "why should I use bitcoin when my Discover card gives me 5%?" and concluding that his situation mirrors everyone else's therefore bitcoin is useless.  It's silly.  If that was the case there wouldn't be check cashing/payday loan centers or Western Union and creditors wouldn't offer rewards because they make money off of people carrying a balance.  It's like someone with legs wondering why anyone would want a wheelchair.

They send it through and when it clears, you get a code.  Then you go and meet.  He releases the bitcoin.  He shows you the code he gets from localbitcoins.  It will match the code you have and you give him the $50.

If you look at the CoinsForTech post they mention how they are able to offer their products for low prices to places like Pakistan which would be impossible to service through the credit card system.

Dear young professional:
Your well thought out points have been brought up almost daily.
Here's the answer. It's not for you. Don't use it. You have access to some of the most sophisticated systems of money payment currently in use. Plus you probably don't even have to pay for them. Now I'm guessing you aren't an accredited investor so there are some things that you can't do but for the most part you are a winner. Cheers.
Bitcoin is for the 5 Billion people without a credit card. Or maybe the +30% of Americans without a bank account.
That's my serious response to your question which has been asked and answered and keeps getting asked.

I think the point your missing is that there will be some magical moment of clarity (Pearl Harbor is a great example!) that will show which side is correct and worthy of support.  I haven't seen anything (at all) like that in Ukraine.  The more I learn, the more I'm inclined to withhold support to either side.
BTW when you mentioned WWII I was thinking about the pre-Pearl Harbor debate.  Before Pearl Harbor it USA involvement was not guaranteed.  There's even a theory that Pearl Harbor was allowed to convince people (no idea if that's what happened but it illustrates the resistance to war in the USA).

Actually from a regulatory view it's very different.  The third party never has control of the funds.  In traditional escrow the third party (escrow) holds the money typically in a bank account.  This makes the transaction much more opaque.  With bitcoin and the public ledger all parties will be able to see when the address is funded however the third party (who offers arbitration services - not escrow services) is never able to abscond with the funds. 
In practical terms you're right.  It replaces the money holding aspect of escrow.

Maybe you're young?  I've had to do charge backs 5+ times over the years.  In fact I've moved to cash for many transactions because most of my problems were from the merchant charging me more/double charging me.  I haven't have to do charge backs for many years but part of that is because I'm the weirdo who doesn't open a tab at a bar and usually carries $300.

Right now we're at the point where people are opting in to Bitcoin.  When it tips to people being forced to use it things will change big time.  For example I'd rather get paid cash if I could.  But my employer doesn't offer that.  Do you think anyone without a bank account wants a check?  If those employers offered bitcoin instead of a check people might go for bitcoin.
Or maybe I make a deal with the housecleaner to take bitcoin instead of check?  Or when I owed my friend some money for a pizza and he accepted bitcoin because I didn't have any cash?  
I think that's how it spreads.  Not from buying it on exchanges or with vending machines.

It's not the ATM -- the restrictions come from the individual ATM operator and/or the bank you are getting the funds from.  For examples ATMs in cash intensive places like Las Vegas casinos don't have $300 limits.

Half way serious question -- Would you put credit cards in the same category?  When you use the credit card your bank pays the merchant -- you pay the credit card company at a later date.  When you purchase a gift card, you are purchasing a credit with the merchant.  You aren't using "cash" to pay -- you're using the credit stored in the gift card.

Max Kaiser.  2010.  I didn't buy until 2013 because I really wasn't into mining and didn't spend the time figuring out exchanges - even if there was one then.  When I finally bought I was so close to using gox but I didn't like the idea of paying to transfer funds.  When I found out about localbitcoins it all clicked and I bought a bunch.

I thought about that.  I don't think he fits the common usage of the word "terrorist" (attacking innocents to achieve a political goal) but he probably fits the lazy 2014 usage of anything the government doesn't like.  Sort of like calling everything a Ponzi scheme.

Most people don't need that much cash.  For example if you need $100K for a downpayment you can just get a cashier's check pretty quickly.  I think it's more logistics than anything else.  They simply don't have the money on hand waiting for you to withdraw $60k cash.

If you expand beyond RIGHT NOW bitcoin can benefit advanced economies by eliminating the need for traditional escrows which can generate fees of $100s to $1000s per transaction.  The reason escrow is so expensive right now is because escrow has to hold onto money which creates liability, licensing expenses, regulatory issues, etc.  With multisig escrow won't be holding/conrolling any money.

Many people have died due to taking legal drugs so clearly your comment is nonsense.  
However, my serious response is that the black market and "illegality" of drugs are far more dangerous and harmful to society than drugs themselves.  Marijuana in Colorado is just the beginning.  People are going to realize that the heavy hand of law enforcement is unnecessary and destructive for narcotics in general -- not just pot.

All my experiences with localbitcoins were great.  Usually you only hear the horror stories.  Based on what we hear about Coinbase you'd think they were murdering children and feeding them to Satanic spiders.  
The only reason I'd hesitate with localbitcoins is a newbie could get turned around by the exchange rate.  For example if newbie gets $20 of bitcoin at an $851 (.02350176) exchange he won't be that happy when gyft tells him he needs .0249 bitcoin for a $20 card.
