Why is it always about investing?  As far as currency goes, it seems dogecoin is actually being used for its intended purpose.

It's a very big concern, and it can happen, which is why I don't invest in Bitcoin, but spend it like currency.  These things don't work if you just hold on to them hoping somebody else will use them as currency.    The only real advantage Bitcoin has is being first to the market.  If somebody makes their own cryptocurrency, and it's easier to use, it will be hard to back Bitcoin.  I've been following Bitcoin since it's first drop from $32 to $2ish, and honestly, I have no idea why it's worth $1000 other than extreme speculation.

I'm actually phasing out of using Dwolla and was just trying to transfer some of my last funds.

Well, as someone who uses adblock and reddit all the time, I think it's a good idea.  Otherwise, how do they generate revenue?  Serious question, I feel like I'm missing something here.

That's some bullshit, I guess it's one more reason to try out Coinbase.

I believe this applies mostly to software engineers that work as software engineers for a company.

Because we can?

Yeah, I don't know if that's true and was kind of reluctant to add it to my post.  I guess what I'm asking is, what are we investing in?  Are we investing in the fact that people are going to start using Bitcoin?  If so, why?  and how, if we're hoarding all of them.  I get that there's a chance I can make a boatload of money, but that's not exactly why I invest.  I invest so that something can grow larger, and yes, I will eventually benefit as well.  In the case of Bitcoin, I feel like I'm actually hurting the currency by investing, and helping it by spending.  This has actually been on my mind for a while, so I'm glad you responded because I really don't know much.  Other than becoming a very rich person, am I benefiting Bitcoin more by investing or spending?

Isn't it harder to access the SR forums?  They're down every now and then, and have to be accessed through Tor.  Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

You could say any investment made with money you can afford to lose is a damn good investment.  I've been watching Bitcoin for about a year and a half, I've made purchases and investments, lost money and gained money, but I still don't understand why exactly I'd want to invest in a currency that I want to see succeed.  I've heard that for Bitcoin to truly be successful, it should be around the cost of 1 USD.  If that's the case, am I hurting the future of Bitcoin by investing?  I feel like that may be the case, and I feel like a greedy asshole when I do that.  Like I said, I want the currency to succeed, not become a millionaire.  I felt like by investing I was actually only investing in myself.  So, for now, I buy and spend my Bitcoin until somebody can explain to me how investing in the currency is actually better than spending it.

Good thing you repeated yourself, it's been quiet lately.
