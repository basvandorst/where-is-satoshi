And the wallet.dat does not have that right? The blockchain is a seperate file. So i could d/l the blockchain and send and the client would allow it?

Appreciate the help, thanks.

Excellent thanks for the tip!

Seems not... just tried it. "Amount exceeds your balance." 
While this could be true, its also likely due to the program only forwarding transaction requests for confirmed balances not unconfirmed. The more you know...

Only just resubbed, so im probably vulnerable to stories like this, but along with girlsgonebitcoin and this story, im wondering if we're about to see bitcoins adoption take off again among everyday people (though not just for speculation this time).

Tried it in ubuntu natty? Doesn't work. Not the GUI version. It might in 11.10 but then *that* version doesn't like my graphics card. Frustrating. I will resort to the CLI version i think.

i think its not a gpu/mining thing, its ubuntu drivers that conflict with the bitcoin clients gui

Great. I will look at this tomorrow. Thanks

I was planning to do this (non-fresh wallet).

So that wouldn't ELI5 well would it? lol
Im clearly struggling with linux 101 and you throw hex editors into the soup (i have used one, im familiar with what hex is...just funny)
+1 for the insight into a possible workaround though

So let me work out a linux checklist for that:
bitcoind source
a bunch of development libs
terminal **make** and **build** commands
to enter a CLI instruction to the network that would succeed
Thats a lot of work. Like, almost as bad as waiting over 24 hours for a blockchain to sync. Bitcoin is pretty damned inconvenient when carried like cash in wallet.dat's.

Theres probably a lot of linux heads would just think whats wrong with just opening a terminal and compiling the source?
Newbies. They're the future of bitcoin. They need idiot-proofing. Windows cant be trusted and linux sucks for noobs. Its a gap.
@_date: 2012-04-13 11:27:24
So you think its possible the blockchain file might modify the wallet.dat just by synchronising (-rescan) and not by making transactions?
I appreciate you may just be saying "i am no expert so dont trust your wallet to my advice" but if you *can* clarify that would be cool.

Be fair, i wasn't seeking tech support, just venting.
I suggested puppy, because it makes customising and then repackaging your newly pimped version as an iso to burn to a cd. So it would be easy for the subreddit to cobble together and peer review for safety/trust.
Im just starting work on getting it going on slackopuppy now. And if i do get it working, i might just do exactly that, put it on rapidshare and post a thread for [to critic.
Edit: Either its shit, or i has the noob bad. Couldn't get my head round it.

Looking into it thanks for the tip.
