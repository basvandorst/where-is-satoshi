Hello Anna.  
Both questions can be answered with the same respond.  
Right now, it is still too early.  Bitcoin is in progress on the field and will be adapted fully, when the financial market will collapse.  I think this will be anytime soon. The old system is on the brick of destruction, and the financial market does do everything to exploit it further and take out the furniture out of the fire. But there is no doubt, it is collapsing due to a huge ponzi scheme and debt.
I forsee by the end of 2016 (or close to that period) there will be huge shifts and changes. So to all Governments, their Secret Services, my Hack and Code friends, Anonymous,  cDc, Indignados, P2P geeks, nutty professors, grumpy coders and activists, who do like to read my posts, You are warned about this: 'Do prepare to shift your assets to a safe garden.' The panama papers are only the top of the mess, and You do known it! Move to a safe garden and I say, it IS bitcoin partly, gold partly. Don't be too late to find out, Your fiat currency is worse as toilet paper.
It is perfectly possible, to maintain bitcoin in a safe manner with technology such as Trezor (hardware) wallets, use other accounts for business and to redraw money with debit cards such as Xapo or Bit-X.
Merchants can convert regular fiat currency in bitcoin with brookers such as localbitcoins, bitstamp, etc.
However, people and business often put their fiat currency as measurement for the value of bitcoin.  Same is done with gold.  This is often due to common behavior. However. You can only measure something properly, if You do not forge the scale to measure something.  This is obviously done with fiat currency.  More about this, see youtube, 'Money as Debt' which can serve Your investigation.
Soon You will see, people and business will put GOLD or BITCOIN (or alike) as measurement, base for ALL fiat currency.  Because You can not mess with gold or bitcoin. You can't make it out of the blue.
We have a habbit to use fiat currency (such as the dollar) as base to measure the value of something.  I expect this will change in future.  People need to have something more honest, suitable as this.  Not something bank and governments can alter on the back of people, to print for free money, both take a part from the printed stack, distribute the other part to the economy.  And finally, well, You are robbed in the wallet.  As You will see You can buy less for the same amount of money (due to additional printed money).  This is robbery, fraud.
Fiat currency is a belief system and it works until people loose their belief, trust. Fiat currency is a note, a certificate of an asset that should be gold.  A note for a deposit. But the deposit is....gone !  
There is actually no real problem in terms of business.  You can perfectly book bitcoins.  You only need to add a 'foreign' currency to Your accountancy program and print out the balance sheets.
However I can understand the governments do look to this with scared eyes. There is no need to ! At the contrary, it can free them from the dominance and slavery from (central, national, private) banks.
But as I stated.  In future all will change.  
It is actually possible to raise up a small tax on every (bitcoin) transaction.  Such as the proposed Tobin taxation. This tax can be redistributed in a small part to governments to make them functional, to large part should be distributed to single-owner-only, personalized and individualized wallets, so to speak one wallet for one person, to raise up an unconditional basic income, to create a social income to ALL PEOPLE on this world. This will ditch poverty ! Take a way from people the fear to fall without income, to the need to survive.This will increase creativity, business, more, it will create added value business that will be in balance with nature. That will not run in a destructive way.  As there will be a base of income ! As it will balance out a lot of things. IF, it is adapted.
So each transaction of bitcoin CAN, if people allow, trigger income for the governments AND all people to ditch poverty and to help our governments to be FREE from their slavery of the banks.  As they are slaves as well, just like You and me, from the loan masters, the banks.
So I do belief, bitcoin, or a cryptocurrency alike, will be the future. it will be the general scale, measurement for money and each transaction will lead to income for state and all people.  Doing business will become again valuable, fun, good to do and an added value, because there will be basic income ! The rich will do a lot of transactions but help with their transactions all others by the tobin taxed traffic. 
So this is what I see, actually soon, in future.
I would say to You, as people wait, until I come forward and present my proof to the world about my real identity, I show here, which I will do soon I fixed my issues, but is actually not that important but my invention and my spread of information, but some want, so I try...which is only be done, to come forward with my PGP key 5EC948A1 (wait-to-use-for-now-until ready) - 4997BEC5 (use-temporary) !!! I repeat !!! To stop all others once for all to hoax. And I hope I can do it so I can reward some people who did do a lot for bitcoin and it's workout.
As I did promise. We see.
I say to you, have some patience !
All the Best to You,
Satoshi Nakamoto (the real one)

First, Yes sure, do You really think they will follow me in public with their personal account ))) You are so naive and unaware who runs different organisations. They follow me and read my stuff. So fine for me how they do.  Second, do you really think the core dev is only on twitter ? You need to inform You better my path in history, things well known...and not. Third, I gave strict orders in 2007 (oh yes, not 2008), later on repeated in 2008/2009. The PGP keys are proof of my authority when I present myself to the board. Nothing else. That's the first answer You will always get from the core team. Show me the keys. So actually I feel very safe right now they keep following my request.  Even to me when i need to fix some things. No problem. As I did repeated again, here as to many places that nobody needs to claim to be me.If they pretend, same,show me the keys.  I did state in this article the fact about my current situation. YOU did not reeds very well my first post.You start to trolling, like a little child.  You still can't let go. As a school boy.  Read clearly my post. I was honest.  And be sure.  I am the only one who has the keys. So shut up with trolling, You look frustrated. I am the real Satoshin and nobody else. And I do not need to proof right now or to proof you things. What did You achieve in life ? Did You do something valuable in IT ? You are not even a hacker or a coder. So You sell lollipops, or what ? The only thing You achieve right now is to make Yourself a fool? Because You make conclusions and assumptions without proof. I am in the only one, able, in the conditions to claim my authority. No other 'false claim' of others can actually, because they do not have my PGP keys. I have them.  I only need to fix them back in good order due to some 'software' issues. Those who are aware of PGP/GPG including the changes are aware of some issues with sub-keys. I do not want to revoke my sub-key yet, just to proof, who I am, to have more problems and issues ! So go to look,Disney, You are a schoolboy, frustrated for some reason. I do not known why. Disney is good for relaxation. Take Bambi.  You still divert the thread to nonsense, I report You again, all the best, Satoshi Nakamoto

I do have a multitude of things in my mind that can improve the bitcoin service.  But right now, in terms of business, you should find a way to provide the common man a secure and understandable way to use bitcoin.  I do not belief in primary, online wallets. I do belief in temporary wallets online. Actually I do support hardware wallets, that are able to provide backups of their data. Second, there is a need to inform the common man, step by step, in an easy way how to use bitcoin, now it is too much for geeks. Still. Third.There is a need to have pre-paid (anonymous) cards, legal, so people can pay, transparent from the fact they do use bitcoins.  For this you need to settle in a country that supports anonymous transactions.  So You need to do some research. Some do settle in Malta.  Maybe You need to look to solutions such as the Island of Man, Cayman islands, Delaware, Monaco...  I am not a lawyer, so You need to look for the right place.  Xapo is a good step in the right direction, however, You need to reveal your identity (due to laws) as their site and mobile application sucks. It does not run on all hardware due to heavy design. I do belief in sites and mobile applications that are minimalistic and run on all platforms, including old devices ! Fourth, (temporary) online wallets with zero-knowledge security, double-authentication, I recommend, Yubikeys for the vault, Google Auth for the wallet You use for transactions. If You do succeed, let me known. I wish you, all the best, Satoshin.

I am Satoshi Nakamoto, and You will not change that, neither the fact I do not proof myself, right now, neither the trolling you do right now.  This thread is not about to proof who I am.  But You proof definitely what You are. As a child wants to cry, you are not Satoshi, because You think I am Neo from the Matrix or whatever I should be. It would not surprise me Your bedroom is full of posters of bitcoin or whatever, because You are so sensitive about the issue. Obsessed actually. But the fact You make conclusions without to proof the opposite makes You, as I stated earlier, a very bad analyst. Here to rattle and trolling.  This thread is about a new invention I made, not about Your crusade to find Satoshin.  Finding Nemo. No Finding Satoshin ! And once You find him, the big wizard of Oz, and You see, he is actually just an ordinary guy, You cry and shout like a teenager, it can't be, because I should be Zeus of the Mount Olympus. You are really funny.  Sure You are disrespectful.  Do I need Your acceptance, no.  I only want to bring a new invention.  And look, I am here in a children's garden.  With some guy, frustrated for the fact, I do reveal myself as Satoshi Nakamoto and can't belief it. Well, it's not my problem, it is Yours.  Read the title of this thread, this is about ditching poverty.  A subject I did discuss long time ago with the inner circle too, but other directions at that time were made. Not about to provide, right now, proof about myself. I did explain that in the FIRST POST.  Can You read, I hope. So Mister, go look to Disney or do something useful, you can learn some morals and teachings, go fishing, play some poker.  But stop to troll my thread. I do not need to learn the basics from You to make conclusions or provide proof. But You better do. For that You need to go to the University to learn logic and how to make deductions, proof.  You can't even read a title and the thread, before You rattle in the margin of the real topic here.  Then you make Your conclusion to negate my stance, without proof.  Well, If I was Your professor of Logic, You could return next year.  As You are really not that important to me I need Your acceptance. Do I ask something from You, no. Nothing actually. I am who I am, nothing will change that.  The time You spend here and did loose to rattle, You could use to invent something, like I did for the World and the People.  To do something positive.  You bring only conflict in Your frustration for what reason it would be. But everyone is able to make inventions.  This is not unique to my person.  You only need to focus, have vision and work pretty hard to convince others if it is theoretical, but everyone is able to invent things. But to spend your time with insults, to troll, to dismiss things without any proof, to rattle like a child, this is far from mature. You do not proof the contradiction in all what I say, so to dismiss the possibility, then to spew out difficult words to impress, does not win Your case at all. At the contrary.  I want You keep   You divert the thread.  Competition is from the old days. Competition is actually, in modern times, where there is soon abundance, as result of technological and scientific inventions, a very primitive stance. More close to the caveman.  That's why, those who evolve, look to sharing.  Sharing ideas, sharing inventions, sharing visions, sharing what they can offer ! What I did, again in this thread to make this world a better place.  So You have definitely lost Your case. Your rant brings nothing valuable to the thread so far that everybody does known already by information widely spread on the internet. All the Best, the real Satoshi Nakamoto (and nobody else).
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:09:28
I want You stop to spoil this thread with your comments.  First You are not a coder, second you do not read clearly what I post.  If You did read my post, then you could known:
1) I do not look for acceptance or to proof right now my claim. I clearly did state the fact in MY FIRST POST.
2) You have not to teach me about how to provide proof. I did explain myself many times on this board and twitter how proof is provided. you really do not need to proof You are smart by repeating my own posts last month.
3) You do not reply  to talk about pgp/gpg there are majordomo listings for that or good old IRC.
4) You are only here to troll, dispute or to proof how smart You became.  You have seen nothing and you do known nothing about me alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Only 3 people do known SOMETHING about me. You are certainly not and I DO NOT CARE.
5) I have nothing to understand about Your behaviour and how You are looking to put attention to You.  This post is about an other VERY IMPORTANT implementation of MY invention, bitcoin, You divert the thread to something else, something NOT relevant.  HOW OLD ARE YOU ?!  
6) Of course OLD PGP keys do not provide proof.  Did I say that ?  I have about 20 PGP keys dating back from 1997.  So please, do not teach me about PGP/GPG.
7) Before You post, read what people post.  Then talk  To make assumptions, to repeat endless what is told or clear is pretty boring.
8) I give a shit what people think about me, if i am genuine or not. At least I AM SURE.  I have the keys, I have my wallets anyway. Nobody else.  I do not need to proof things by words, endless disputes neither I have to proof anything to someone or you to finally have CNN, newspapers, television, the CIA, NSA, all secret services and charities on my doorstep. So actually I LOVE people do not belief me, if the most important ones think it could be me, I can live with that. But I do not like fraud or people are hurt because other do think it's me.  Reason why I did stop the things around Dorian with a single post, then I did close the account.
9) The world is looking for me, but I do present myself to the world when time is right, when I fixed my mess in the first place, and solely at my Will ! Do You really think, I want attention like You , at the contrary, I do avoid attention for reasons, if I present something, I have people like You spoiling a thread with crap.
A) I give things away from free.  As I did do with my bitcoin invention to make this world a better place. I really do need nothing in return.  No noble price, no money, no acceptance, no attention, nothing.  Most of the time, I want to do my own stuff, and be left alone.  But I do not accept people who claim to be me. 
**Do You really think, if I was NOT Satoshi Nakamoto (Satoshin), HE of SHE would allow I am here to spread nonsenses on Reddit, on twitter, if HE did post pretty fast a comment with his own account he/she was not Dorian Nakamoto ?!** 
Well this is not conclusive, I known, only my keys are final proof.  I stated endless this fact, since more as 7 years ago.  Key 0x5EC948A1 actually.  But at the moment, NOBODY, is able to proof I am NOT Satoshi Nakamoto. There is no proof I am at the moment, but You can post everywhere and ask that the real Satoshin steps up to PROOF I am NOT.  To make me a liar and a joker. I say to You, only proof is with my key. Nobody can proof I am not, nobody can proof they are. Because I have the keys, no one else. So take at least the consideration in Your mind, I could be genuine, before You make Yourself more ridiculous in threads I do post, that will be soon, be part of the history when i do reveal myself in public and in full with full proof. And if not, well, ALL is written in the book of God.
So this is said to be clear.  **This thread is about A MAJOR NEW STEP in the process to make the blockchain, bitcoin a tool for humanity. To create a huge system so finally to ditch poverty in this world by the aid of the blockchain.**
If You keep trolling and make not relevant posts, I have no other option as to contact the moderators. If not You would write a book here by endless, not relevant remarks. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 10:24:21
This idea was the second idea, I had after my first invention.  At that time I could not make another paper, because it was too early to spread this idea. Not everyone is willing to ditch poverty in this world, some people think it is actually good (for them). I had always the idea, poverty brings only misery. I noticed in my personal life the proof. His remark is irrelevant as You stated, thanks, as he does not respect my request to focus on the topic.  In our time, we consider such actions as trolling.  I am not here to talk about my person, give proof, to respond to all questions.  I do this later, when I fixed my mess, because real proof comes with my Satoshin key. So i can only inform, for the record, what does happen at the moment. What need to be done right now, regardless people do belief or not.

It was not hacked at the time I did post my message about Dorian Nakamoto.  I did post that message, not the hacker.  Besides this was not a hacker at all, that person simply did register again satoshin then acted as a child to confuse people and to impersonate me. This is not hacking, this was solely the fault of GMX Germany.  (Thank You guys for this, btw, for Your bad services) As I did learn never to use again a free mail service. The guy did found nothing valuable to use. Not my wallet, not my PGP keys. As I did sign almost all my messages, so it was hard to impersonate me without to be able to clear-sign. You have not to worry about anything, You better worry about Your attitude. This attitude is far from respectful and mature, as You would be a very bad analyst.  Your conclusions do proof that enough, including your way of interaction, communication and especially Your ability to read posts and news as it should. So will You respect my thread now ? You have nothing to offer that is valuable here, as You keep trolling, worse You insult people. You claim to be geek and You can't even code as You state. Says enough.

Once I presented bitcoin to the communities at Metzdowd, P2P Foundation, some great 'hackers', including some who did outstanding work in cryptology, it did start as slow as this idea did start.  I am used to that idea, things go slow on this planet.  Mainly because people,  such as You, do make too much noise.  Have nothing to say but to attack the player of the piano, not listen to the music :-) Good luck in Your path to find reason, clear judgement and especially deep insight without mockery. Because this is all pretty primitive behaviour that brings only conflict, nothing of value to this world.  And about my idea, don't worry, my tweet's are lightning fast and do propagate much faster on some channels as on Reddit.  To come here was, well, nostalgy, I suppose.  But the word is out, including Your rattle of nonsense and noise on the channel. What is your added value, nothing. But I am sure, my idea will grow like a huge tree on this world, soon or later ! I am pretty sure about it just as I was pretty sure about bitcoin and the blockchain more specific, and it's possibilities and implementations not limited to money ! All the Best, Satoshi Nakamoto

Unfortunately in this world, having business ideas, vision or invention does not lead directly to a successful business. I started business in 1997 or something.  About 10 years later I wrote the bitcoin paper.  At that time, I did focus entirely on my business, not that much to my invention.  I was happy other coders did do their work based on my idea. But I did learn one thing.  It is hard to do business without the right funds.  Long time ago I did register some exciting domain-names, like shop.fr After 10 years (or more), now I am able to put something online, i consider to create a shop exclusively with bitcoin payment etc.  Anyway, you need funds, investment in such way, they do not take over your company or ideas.  Investors are so greedy and full of impatience. So be careful. So I do reply on this message what I think that would be a good idea to do business.

I did reply already on the scalability issues in a previous post on Reddit, as I did on Twitter. If I need to choose between Peter's view and Gavin's. I choose Peter's vision. But now my vision. Users should be able to run their own stack. If You do increase the block-size, the danger is actually, You open the gates to centralisation. As I stated additionally. Bitcoin is not only about mining... The scalability are issues the coders has to solve, not me. But if there is, really, no other way as to increase the block-size, I hinted to a possible solution already. To use a dynamic size, not a static size, such as 2n way, defining, n as parameter before the transaction as low as possible in relation to the LAG at that moment. Analogically, we can think to what is done in music, we have CBR versus VBR. When there is a high amount of data to handle, the VBR raises, when all is steady and quiet, the VBR lowers in bit-rate. So I think, they need to look to a dynamic block-size. But again, I am only someone who has a vision. This is work for the coders, but beware of the implications of a solution. But I think the dynamic size would solve all problems, including future ones. I consider this a third invention or improvement.

I do agree, I am not a good false-Satoshi-Nakamoto.  Because, I am the real one, like You are clearly trolling.  If You do not known what this is, read wikipedia about it, instead of starting flaming, heating up something for what reason. Honestly, I did not even read Your reply, full of wrong conclusions, hate, frustration and not able to communicate in a calm and mature way. I am the only real one.  Live with it. I did reported You again. ;-) So You learn to behave, as You You lack respect for others in Your way of communication, if that opinion is different from Yours. Especially if You can not proof Your statements, such things are rather, stupid to attack someone, if You can not proof the opposite. But You can still look around to find Your Satoshi Nakamoto. Ask him/her to change my public key.  ;-) So that sure, I am about my claim. Do You really think I make such claim without to be sure ?! Think further, if I do publish my real name in this thread ? Nobody will find one person able to do.  Because I am the one, my friend, and I will not hurry because of You. When I am ready, You will be part of the hall of ignorance and a good example of a bad (frustrated) analyst, hm, not able to code, speaking out of the butt.  I hope one day, You understand, when people do make claims, You have to proof the opposite.  If the claim is not proven, it is, a possibility.  How small it looks for you! Your problem, not mine. You act like a child, far from respectful and with a clear perception on the matter.  Such behaviour, You can find in the Mid Ages. Taking judgement without proof of guilt.  You seems to be good at it.  But is it truth, no it isn't.  Until the proof is delivered. Satoshin, the real one.

This was always my English I did use. I am not from the UK or Japan. My scientific paper was corrected by someone else.  You will have another face if I present my original keys, now I consider Your remark as insulting. I am not here to make false claims, to make jokes, to be another who dreams and want to be a pop-star or to attack people. Besides it's not hard now to find my identity, I did post a PGP key about 10 years older as my Satoshin key. Do You really think I make jokes if I have a key (not anti-date of 1998 ?!) Who did use PGP at that time ?  yes, PGP, not GnuPG at that moment... Anyway. I do not hide myself any-more, but I have to fix some issues, I hope I can fix them.  At the contrary. I give AGAIN some idea for free. This idea can NOT wait any more, especially with all the fugitives who come to Europe, soon a huge financial collapse (in progress). It's NOT because all people over the world make assumptions, conclusions, hypothesis, they are right in all this.  I am only a simple guy but I program since my 16.  I make errors in English, I am a coder, not a linguist.  But seems everyone can understand what I say, so fine for me, in my funny English.  if You do read the messages I did post on majordomos (Metzdowd,...) ,a moment at IRC, those who do known me, my mails, I used the same style of English. The world is not run by those who speak English only. My native language is Dutch. I am from Belgium.  The NSA was close to find me at that time, but was redirected to my old university, when I was Young, finally came to the computer of one of the professors in crypto-science in Belgium.  ( But they hit the wrong man. They did want to find me. Well if they need me, they can call me. I did wrote only a scientific paper, nothing more. Most work was not coded by me at all. As  was not involved with anything such as wikileaks, silkroad, laundry or whatever. I would appreciate You keep Your words, related to me as person, in the section 'not proofed yet, but possible' and focus on my idea. I need the coders back to work to another exciting idea,so in 7 years from now, we can ditch poverty in the world. Which leads to a more safe world, less violence and criminality. More balance and peace. This is a win-win for all, including governments. This idea is the solution to solve poverty. So I need AGAIN, coders who want to implement my idea as they did with bitcoin.

Only debates about my proposition. Thoughts, comments in this regard.  Please do respect the core issue. So do not ask here questions about me, or a full interview about all your questions You have, this is for later, when I fixed my keys in a proper way. (I hope) Satoshin
@_date: 2016-03-05 03:08:46
My mind starts to get old. Right now, the block-size is a static size, but maybe We should consider parametrisation, to have a dynamic size of 2^n in function of n. But do not mistake. I did not code most of the project, others did. Whatever You belief.  
@_date: 2016-03-05 05:18:53
I say to You, before You make Your judgement, read my post and read this at the bottom of my first post :






So i did post the right key, exactly the same key **1024D/5EC948A1** You do mention, published
on the Foundation-site, right ? Good ! So, I explained the situation as it is, mr Wise Nose. 
As I clearly stated my proposition is signed with **0x4997BEC5**, look for Yourself when this key
was generated and published (1998). Do you really think I do enjoy to have fun, here ?! Not really.  Is it proof my older key is linked to the first, well, no.  But I stated this in my footer.
But somehow I DO agree with You, it can not made clear enough my key is 1024D/5EC948A1, as many try do publish not related keys in the PGP Public Database.
I told clearly in my post, I am busy to fix my subkey 0x5EC948A1.  Yes, it's a subkey in my key-chain.  Not my primary actually.  So last months, I am busy to find out what I messed up. Shit happens. That's how it is, so until it is fixed, You have to wait. On the other hand, I have no press on the front door, not the NSA, the CIA, my own government, so after all not such bad situation. 
If I can not fix it, well you have to wait until we are both dead for the final proof.  
Life is short anyway on Earth.
And if this is the case, NO ONE, is able to change my public key **0x5EC948A1**, but me.
So i state this clear, no one will present him or herself again, I took my precautions. I instructed clearly to my inner circle, the PGP key is my proof of authority. Nothing else.
**It's me that will provide proof, and if I am unable, nobody else.**
I am not here to say, hello, look at me, I am back, put the spot-lights on.  No, i am here because I expect many months of search and struggle, and recently the world changes too fast, so I can not wait to publish what should be the next step in the story of bitcoin.  I have no other choice to do 
it currently this way, and AGAIN, I need assistance from those who known who they are !!!
Reason why I say, take me for a joker, but read my message, stick 
But OK, You have somehow, a point. My apologies.
Have a good day,
Satoshin 
(whatever people belief or not. I don't care, actually)

No. I am the author and Hal Finney is the coder. Wait a few months, and you will have your answer. There is a reason why Craigh Wright does back off. They are aware of the published PGP key and I have made a registered depot of the bitcoin.pdf signed with my PGP key. just wait some time, and if all goes well, You have your answer. But do known there is a battle between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin-XT for some reason. And I known what reason.

Maybe You did miss the memo, Craig Wright provided false proof to Gavin Andresen, tricked him and is not able to provide further proof and vanish after I bite in his tail on other social media ? Besides, the age of your account is no guarantee for success.  i did register here before. But one battle is already exposed and won.  Now the next. Watch and see how strange things can go ;-) I will recall Your 7+ years old account.

But not conclusive.  The pgp key is. He takes advantage of the fact he has probably something of the early stages.  Or he was inside the core team, with some credits, or he has access to things. Again, I am sure when a professor in the USA propose to nominate, me, for the Noble Price, this is based on my scientific paper, not on the implementation of it.  That's why I always told, I will reward somehow the people who were honest.  If I can proof my pudding of course.  But to grab the Noble Price, I am sure they are smart enough to ask him to proof, not to claim.  As Pete did execute the first words I did want to hear. Proof it.  I have to admit, I still digging in my mess. Wright does known that story because I did attack him on twitter for his claims and he makes advantage of the situation.  And, I saw the Australian government did want to find things, I think there is much more to the story.  As the core people do known, I am at all happy with the fact, in the early stages, my invention was used by smart people to trade in things I do hate actually. But that's world.  But I need to worry and find out why he could make his claim.  But I am sure, Pete or Wladimir will put him, Check-mate.  I am sure.

Because he has not the key at all or my wallet is hacked or stolen.  Simple.  Or he was part in the early stages.  As acadamic the Noble price is the Opus Magnum to get.  What a vanity.  I am the last to take vanity, but I do not like pretenders. I was honest all the time, whatever people may doubt or think.  I proof one day, I just have to clean my mess. But those people, they want rewards from humanity, but my reward is noticed in the book of Life. I just wonder why he has the gutts to claim, he is me.  Part of coding proofs nothing. What counts is my key. This wonders me, I known I revolted his claims on twitter many months ago.  So maybe he lies to escape justice or something else. Anyway, too much ego to be me, actually.  But why he does copy-cat me, as he clearly does not known I had a PGP key in pgp.mit.edu signed by, we all known. Satoshin
