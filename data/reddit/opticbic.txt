Huawei phones are known to have malware from the factory. I would not be surprised if that is what happened.

Yeah i see what youre saying. Ofcourse it would not be exactly like bitcoin. But that is why i said bitcoin is a beta to a new currency. No one would join the beta if they knew a gov or entity was running it. Make it annonymous and people will join. Its like an anonymous unknown study they could be running on us. But yeah, im just having fun and like talking conspiracys, because who fuckin knows anything really.... most humans just believe what is told and taught to them. Most believe and listen to another human who told them "how it is". Ie: doctors, gov, banks, teachers. 
So, just a reminder , we are just talking conspiracy and what could or could not be. So thankyou singularityissonear for leaving a real response and not some bs.

LOL i love that theme song. I mean if he is trying to end the fed , what would happen. I just posted a thread on new world crypto/blockchain. Plus, it would be like we owe someone $ (the fed reserve) and then we are saying fuck u we aint paying.. how does that work.
The more i think about it, the US dollar seems to be in the same situation as okex situation lol... uh.oh

Have you even tried to use coinbase and buy the bitcoin with your debit card. It worked for me. Or did you just call bank of america and ask if you can buy bitcoin. Because they for sure will say no.. they do not know anything about crypto.

It is just a link to a youtube video with a ref link to the tatatu website, which i checked out and it says nowhere that you get 70$ a day, and fuck... if you did than no one would have a job...

Everyone will charge you a fee. You buy with cash, you will pay more than the current price of bitcoin, thats a "fee".
If you want to try and be legit and "legal" for tax stuff and what not. Than yes, i would suggest buying from a known exchange like coinbase. I believe coinbase also owns kraken or gemini or something and has lower "fees". But the fee's are not shit if you believe btc will go up and you are somewhat long term holder. 
But yeah. If you buy btc from someone with cash, and than later you use coinbase or another service to cash out, it is going to be hard to tell your tax guy or irs what you paid for the bitcoin when you go to pay taxs on it.
If you want to be cool and say fuck the establishment (i do not suggest this) than yeah go to localbitcoins and find someone in your area that has a ton of feedback and has been doing it for years.
Suggestion for your first in person sell or buy of bitcoin. :: Do not sell or buy a huge amount of bitcoin in cash your first time meeting this person somewhere. I would do a couple 100$ trades for btc and get to feel if that person is legit or going to rob you. 
Selling btc always safer than buying. Mother fuckers cant pull bitcoin out of your pocket. Cash they can. So just be very aware.

Might be hard to get $6 in btc. Such a small amount. Might be easier to get like $20 worth. Hell, what kind of stuff can you do? Someone here might trade you $10 btc for some work
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:33:16
Not exactly. As building phones and computers slightly differs from being a currency. I mean we all have thought we "wish we could go back in time and buy ibm, apple, google, or gold when it was cheap"
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:06:48
Ok. I watched the video. He doesnt go into much detail on MacCoin...i mean can i buy a mac coin today worth 1 bigmac and in X amount of time its worth 5 bigmacs... or could it be worth .1 bigmac. Fuckin confusing. I will have to look into this
Edit: ok i looked into it, looks like 14,000 mc donalds are handing out a Mac coin with every purchase of a big mac. The coin is good for 1 free big mac until the end of 2018... 
So to me, it is just buy 1 get 1 free big mac... yeah ok its a 50th aniversary coin and could be worth more than a big mac in the future, as mc donalds toys sometimes sell for a lot now.

Find someone who wants something and is paying in btc. Than buy it on amazon and trade. Purse.io is a place you can kinda do this.

I think the web page never loaded. I also think, what does body building and pharmacys have to do with you investing.

I looked into this the best i could. Looks like a fuckin scam. Using these poor kids situation to earn $... first off. It says nothing about helping these kids. It just says pluto is a way to store data on a blockchain... these kids do not need their data to be stored on a blockchain, fuck they dont even need a blockchain.. this pluto coin is just another "non for profit" fuck coin... this is pretty fucked up... 
Ps: least you didnt leave a ref link.. fuck.
Edit: i see this and instantly think of those hurt animal just for 50cents you can help out sarah mcglocklen commericals. In the arms of an angel i mean scammer.
Besides... in crypto people want to make $. If they wanted to donate then they would just do that. I am so tired of these "help people" coins. It just doesnt work. Look at our fuckin churches handing around baskets for $. Its a fuckin scam, pay to get into heaven.  NOTHING TO SEE HERE BUT A PLOY TO USE YOUR EMOTIONS AGAINST YOU. I am not saying do not help these kids. We all should if we are able to. Just dont use pluto or any scam ass people helper coin.
Fuck, at that rate just send bitcoin or money to a person who runs a help center there. Better yet, gey in touch with a school there and mail teaching supplies and stuff for the kids there.

I like to think of it as what a lot of coins are doing now a days. A "coin swap". The usd is possibly in a bubble. If it crashes, their $ crashes too. So why would they not ditch it to start fresh and continue this "willy wonka golden goose"?
Ps thanks for the legit response
Edit: maybe usd has become a giant pump and dump scam.

Fyi, you will NEVER get a single satoshi mining btc with a usb miner. Infact, even tho electricity is "free" on your base, id be fuckin careful with that shit. 
But if they do not care, than buy a bunch of antminers and actually get $ coming in. Hell the electricity is free....
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:00:57
Well assuming they didnt create bitcoin, they have no control of bitcoin. But, in theory they could control bitcoin. If the gov can call up the fed reserve and get any amount of money, they could just buy infinite amount of bitcoin right...?

And you invest in stocks? Do you buy things with stock shares? This isnt to move money around.. this is a store of value as of right now. Converting fiat to bitcoin to buy something is semi pointless as the market swings quick and fee's are there. You would only switch fiat to bitcoin to buy some thing under the radar. (Do not get that confused with making profit in crypto and buying something, which i agree with)
Edit: "Heres the thing, I'm not going to buy $100 BTC to buy something that costs $42, in my mind that $58 is now gone." Why the fuck are you even here then... and you do not have to buy 100$ btc to buy something for 42$ btc.. learn fucking math bro.. learn btc. Learn fees. Learn investments. Being someone who invested in stocks before has no fucking knowledge in crypto. Not many know crypto knowledge even after being in it for years.

Does a 2$ fee for .9btc even matter... what the fuck you investing in bitcoin when you are worried about a 2$ fee. Freedom is worth much more. Fuck coinbase.. find local otc and hodl. If not then leave the game
Edit: maybe i read what you wrote wrong... you are trying to buy 90cents worth of bitcoin ? And dont want a 2$ fee??

Ok that makes sense. But in the event that i break, lose or have  the trezor stolen,  am i able to use the seed key on a different wallet to move the funds off the trezor to a different wallet until i buy another trezor? 
Also what if trezor goes out of business years down the road?
