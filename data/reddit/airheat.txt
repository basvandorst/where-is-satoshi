How do I join? I have servers laying around. Any risks involved? Any estimates on how much I'd get paid now and when it gets more mainstream?

The only one of those that would be bad is treating it like real estate/property taxes where you get taxed just sitting on it. It's only capital gains on the money you pull out that you made. If I recall correctly, it's your top marginal rate if you take it out less than a year and one below if you wait longer. If it's going to be used in the real world government is going to take some.

You really bought into that media narrative that turned out to be a lie didn't you... I'm sure a country with the GDP of Italy is secretly bossing around Trump. What are they going to do stop selling vodka and gas to Europe that doesn't affect the US at all?

You need to borrow more money now. How do you do it? You offer offer take a loan with a higher interest rate. Pretty much what the government is doing. Also, wage inflation leads to regular inflation. Bitcoin inherently deflates. Bitcoin will be worth more because the dollar will be worth less.

I mean we're constitutionally obligated to pay debt, but at that point you're right. You'd be fighting raiders in the wastelands.

That last one trump is on the record saying sometimes you need to prime the pump.

Generally speaking no. You don't want wealth to get locked up. That's why essentially all modern finance systems have inflation built in. Mild inflation is usually a good thing for an economy along with easy access to capital and liberal bankruptcy laws.

How much of his income is from that? If it's a large part, that's one thing, but if it's not, it's just conspiratorial. Looking at the results of a search I see that people really don't want you to watch this guy. Watched him and seems to be saying stuff that anybody that isn't on the fringe anti freedom communist left would approve of.

So these Koch brothers are they in cahoots with the illuminati or the lizard people? I've been reading your replies and they seem conspiratorial and very biased.

Wake up sheeple Dave Rubin is the build a bear group that faked the chem trail landings!

Yes, but just because somebody took money at one point doesn't mean it's done elaborate conspiracy though. It's the same thing as soros on the right. Do you think everything he says is written by the Koch brothers or something?
