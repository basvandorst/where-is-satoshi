PIA is based in the US and somehow has a marketing presence several times larger than any competitor so I don't really trust them.

Ehhhh... I am very aware of distributed ledgers and love them. 
I honestly feel like I'm debating with a religious person with the level of simile and metaphor that just occurred, buuuut against my better judgement think of it this way,
Bitcoins would have to become over 100x as expensive as it is right now to get close to google's current market cap. Not the best economic indicator of value but it helps give an idea.

Google is the company making it so those literally billions of people without internet access can get connected to even use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-03 04:21:41
I don't know if bitcoin is ever going to be "more important than google", that's getting a bit dramatic and fanatic.

Anarchism (as political theory, disregarding it's etymology) doesn't really mean absence of a state as much as it means absence of exploitative heirarchies.
I think limited and consented confederacy with proper liquid delegation limits and prevents more dangerous heirarchies.
It is a bit rare to see a statist anarchist but they do exist even if it seems like a bit of an oxymoron. Syndicalists support limited states, for example.
Also, pragmatists and realists see states as integral for transitionary periods in a lot of other branches of anarchism.

I'm an anarchist socialist. I don't think bitcoin, at least in the next 30 years, will give us a technological utopia. I have a lot of frustrations with states and believe in agorism but I think it's worth addressing what might happen if some large chunk of sales are suddenly untaxable.
In my state we don't have sales tax. Maybe other places will follow that model? But how would income be taxed?
I get the love of the free market but if you just sidestep government without introducing a proper confederation for legal purposes you easily end up with exploitative situations like oil companies out in the middle east.

I don't wanna pay to steal, especially as it's further complicating the torrenting process (as a less technically inclined user)
Maybe that will work for a sizable portion of users though.

Facebook is pretty convinced it knows where you are within a half mile even if you have never had a profile or used their app.
That's not even psychology yet that's just big data applications.

But for every tech specialist in the intelligence community, there are a thousand outside of it. And with Snowden &amp; Co's publicity, those thousand are aware of the situation.
Keep in mind it is in the interest of these intelligence communities to have employees go off and develop supposedly secure applications so that they can backdoor the product and continue their monopoly on information once such systems become mainstream.

Bitcoin is not a store of value, it's at best a medium of exchange.
Ideally it may be in a few years if laws are clarified and the price stabilizes.

This is totally accurate, sorry your being downvoted.

I've been lurking for a while for a report for school, but now that's finished, I'm still here!
I think this stuff is interesting and wouldn't mind a few cents to encourage me to get necessary programs and such up and running.
Thanks for the opportunity, have a good day!

Still detrimental to adoption. You want to get views from readers more than the person you tipped IMO.
It's about visibility more than the individual you tipped's adoption IMO.

What do you mean by "join the sub"?
The low barrier to entry is reddit's largest strength.
The large population is what enables me to have content from my various underground interests right next to each other, all aggregated in one place. I can get content from and at the same time.
If starts going to shit, just do what did, and make The original is still useful because it attracts new users who can find Presumable it (also acts as a karma mill for new users to encourage them to continue to use the site. This way, eventually, someone will branch out and join one of the smaller communities I'm in. They might shitpost at first, but if the growth is controllable then it's pretty easy to keep them in line after a couple reminders.

Please call it Etherium, it doesn't have to be associated with spam more than it already is.

Wikipedia has very clear, necessary, and impartial standards though. Don't knock Wikipedia or compare the disasters of this community to Wikimedia's wonderful and open organization.

read up at and stop buying shit people tell you to buy on here, that's not diversifying. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:42:12
I'd assume purchasing power can't be higher if it's not beating inflation.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:58:22
I apologize for my tone--I got the impression you got into investing with bitcoin, and then was convinced you needed to enlarge your portfolio by buying gold in order to 'diversify.' I thought chastising would make you reconsider that trajectory.
I still don't think gold is a safe enough investment to qualify to be a part of a diversification strategy but that's a lot more debatable than trying to basically hedge bitcoin with gold.

It's a [study done by facebook]( not via facebook.  
Facebook isn't fucking around with data analysis.
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:23:34
The title is taking a stat that was in the context of '-for financial advice' rather than "with their money ('money matters' as in op)" 
The study seems to be a convoluted way to tell banks to advertise to ~27 year old women with mobile-friendly infographics. It was kinda interesting though.

Does anyone there know what the market is like there? I'm curious if it would be easy to buy there or if there is too much demand.

I think part of the reason their adoption was slower was because they had another electronic currency that was established before bitcoin became popular but I'm not sure and can't remember the name of it.
Anyway westerners often think of Japan as some techno-uptopia but they as a general population are wayyyyyyy behind the times for anything technological.

The Economist is the best newspaper I know at admitting mistakes as well. If they get something big wrong, they could make a whole cover story on how they were wrong.
I'm not a super liberal person but when consuming liberal news I like how biases are so plainly laid out. Like if they talk about Russia or Putin, in the first paragraph or so they'll say "which this newspaper has a history of criticizing" or similar.

It's just a gift, and it's larger than 0 cents?
Am I the only broke ass around here that thinks getting dimes and nickles is pretty sweet? Shit adds up, yo. A dozen more funny reddit comments and he has himself a shitty coffee or a doughnut.
Do you not accept tips under 25 cents? A dollar?
