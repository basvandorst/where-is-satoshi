You do know that the government will use your money to "make you whole" when your bank fails. It would be more honest to just loose the money you've never paid to a third party in the first place. That way you're responsible for your own money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:06:36
Blind trust isn't a good solution either, crypto is like cash. Sure you can get scammed or robbed but at least you have a fair opportunity to secure your life savings yourself. A trusted third party could be a scammer as well, you don't know that. And once you do it's too late anyway. Just look at North Korea and Kim Jong Un.

The dollar doesn't have to drop (correct) -30% regularly as it drops around 2% every year anyway. Also people do loose their dollars all the time, some get robbed, some get scammed, some loose it because the bank gets hacked, bank loose the money in bad investments, stock market bubbles etc. 
The only difference is that everyone else has to pay for those who are dumb enough to loose their money. Just like the idiot insurance which I believe is very expensive these days. The real ignorance is from people who blindly trust the government to solve all their problems for "free". Nothing is free in this world.

Might be possible to accomplish that using a VPS provider with hourly billing that accepts cryptocurrency.

Sounds like a perfect setup for email phishing

Well bitcoin is still safer than cash tho, if a robber puts a gun to your head asking for your wallet which is full of cash he can basically kill you and take your wallet. That's not possible with bitcoins, it's also pretty dumb to rob someone if you don't know if they have any money on them or not. 
Most armored robberies in the bitcoin world would probably take place in dark alleys and places with no witnesses after planning a meeting AFK for an exchange with cash on sites like localbitcoin.com and similar. Always meet in a public area with lot's of people or why not outside your local police station.
However the most common type of theft will definitely be online via phishing (people are dumb and can easily be fooled to post their wallet seed), there may be Trojans and malware looking for wallet seed in local text files, Script injection where a address is replaced with another online is also possible or if you run a hard drive recovery company or recycling company where you look for bitcoins and other crypto currencies on old hard drives.

[Cryptonator]( might work, there's no verification on identity there so it's possible their limits are high. Otherwise you may have to buy small amounts on a daily basis until the 1M is invested.

Patience is the key in all investments, although I think it's common sense not to sell if the price drops after you're buying. $1000 down to $100 means a loss of $900. That's frustrating but does it matter if I also loose the last $100? I still got the asset. I mean this sort of things happens everywhere, not just with bitcoins. 
I know a guy who bought a house back in the early 90's for $20´000, people warned him about the bubble and then the market crashed. He was angry about the loss and sold the house for just $1. Today that house is worth $300´000.

Here's a map over local merchants worldwide that accept bitcoin payments:

When people start to panic sell it might be a good thing that Coinbase crashes as it makes people stop and think twice  before doing something stupid like selling the coin they just bought for $3000 for a value of $2200.

As far as I know there's no separate tax on crypto currencies but you do have to pay capital tax like you would also have to do if you bought something cheap and then sold it expensive. That tax applies to the profit you make on the exchange and you would only have to pay it if you sold crypto for fiat. A way to go around this would be to order a debit card that allow you to pay directly from a crypto wallet, then you wouldn't need fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:33:39
Actually there are some bitcoin banks offering VISA debit cards directly connected to your bitcoin wallet. It may not the cheapest solution but it could be a potential replacement for fiat banks and currencies.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:17:03
Fiat is the real scam, I lost ~24% in just a few hours.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:08:59
Noticed how the price was down to $2200 this morning so I thought perfect time to buy, then my shitty bank decided to not process my debit card payments. Out of all days the system could fail, why today? I was literally pissed of watching the payment being stuck while the price continued to grow and now 1 BTC is worth $2400. I literally lost $200 on fiat for each BTC I could have bought today.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:21:02
Correction I think, market psychology states that $2999.99 is cheap while $3000.00 is expensive. The same principle applies here, as soon the prices goes above $3000 people start to sell for quick profit. It wont take long until we pass $3000 again.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:54:02
Fiat will continue to drop in value so I think Litecoin is a better choice if you plan to cash out. Some people will probably cash out before Aug 1 causing the price to fall, just like every time something big is happening.

Centralized exchanges could never make any profit if they allowed people to buy and sell at any time they wanted. If you want to make profit on exchanging then try exchanging between crypto currencies instead of crypto to fiat and vice versa. Their fees would have eaten your profit anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:52:42
While a divided bitcoin allow you to buy for the same fiat amount you used too, it's gonna take more traders to buy a full bitcoin when the price is higher. When bitcoin becomes a more accepted payment method among the majority more people are gonna use it as a currency rather than something you can exchange for quick money and thus the price will become more stable over time, that's not stupid.

Had some trouble with an exodus exchange getting stuck a few days ago, took maybe 30-40 hours but as soon they responded they where very helpful. Just be patient, there may be more with the exact same problem who needs help.

Well it depends on how crypto assets are defined:


Further down there's more info regarding how IRS handle crypto assets:






* Gains made from converting Bitcoins into a fiat currency are subject to capital gains tax
* Purchases of goods or services with Bitcoins must also account for gains
* Bitcoins and other alt-coins obtained from mining is recognised income immediately at their fair value
* Mining equipment can still be deducted as a legitimate business expense

You're right, although I find it a bit funny that they say it's down for *maintenance* during outages when it's under dimensioned. Not all customers know the http response codes and their meaning.

It's amazing how much we're controlled by feelings, he obviously had good intentions but recognizing the same behavior all scammers use was enough to loose the trust in ethereum. I guess I'll try my luck in Golem and Augur for now, nothing to loose and they have the same potential as ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:48:30


Very accurate, just look at the last decades, has anyone ever talked about money loosing it's value? nope all people talk about is how everything keeps getting more expensive. Like if it was all about greedy merchants. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:14:52
And they made profit, unless they sold below the original amount they bought their coins for.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:23:36
It's never to late for profit, but if you're looking for big profit you may be late. No one can predict the future.

Alright which school, library or university are you at? some of those places tend to block P2P traffic to "prevent" piracy but that also has a negative effect on crypto currencies.

I wish I could buy but the bank says I already bought enough today. Fuck the banks, telling me what I can and can't do with my own money.

I agree, I also failed to buy on the dip so I know how you feel
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:14:02
The higher the price is, the less violate it'll be because less people are gonna afford to exchange back and forth from fiat in amounts high enough to turn into profit. Looking forward to higher prices.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:04:42
Result of 2013: $100 -&gt; $1100 -&gt; $200 which is 100% profit and then it started to raise again, although it took a little over a year, 100% profit in just 1 year is still very good. Where else could you possibly get that?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:17:31
I wish I bought Ethereum back then :)
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:31:49
The key thing is to never invest more than you can afford to loose. This rule should also apply to things like keeping a huge amount of fiat currency in a regular bank account which is actually more risky.

It's an alternative to Twitter featuring freedom of speech. Twitter has been censoring people with political opinions they think is wrong lately and it's not just extreme opinions, it's more like Sweden's infamous threat list. Think of it this way: if censorship on Twitter wasn't a problem, then why make a Twitter clone just to get freedom of speech?
