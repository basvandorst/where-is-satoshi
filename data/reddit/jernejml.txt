The administration is intentionally weakening US Dollar. And it's citizens don't even care. Or even worse - they probably don't even understand it.

Damn. Just say "Soros" and quite large segment of society goes completely crazy. Scary.

I seriously doubt that. My experience is that most people just don't care about nature of money or it's properties. "unit of account", "store of value", "fungibility", etc..  blah blah for them.

More important is policy transparency. Public debate about the issues. Government should also declare in which way are they thinking/planning to regulate - so there aren't any surprises. Also, there should be announcement about the datehour of future publishing of news/policies/announcements etc.

There are not taxes on dollar transfers. Are you suggesting new taxes?

Read the 2nd part: "A miner would want to do this because bigger blocks take longer to propagate to the rest of the network"
Probably this is the reason...

I also agree with some kind of regulation. But not taxes on money transfers. I will gladly pay sales tax when i consume things.

The problematic part is that if capitalization reaches a few trillion dollars, it could affect real economy. Crypto crash could cause a recession etc...

They sold because their basic assumptions were not correct. It's the only logical thing to do. 
I guess they calculated that Apple will generate huge amount of cash in the next few years.  Even if its profit falls a little. Profits would fall significantly only if iphone loses it's global status as best smartphone. I guess they bet, it won't.

I hope people understand that LESS code is better (for same functionality).  Additionally, the last thing you want when you are coding p2p network for exchanging value - is complexity.

Lol. He is not losing money until apple's profits fall significantly. He is probably buying now.
