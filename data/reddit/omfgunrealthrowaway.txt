I’d love to.  I truly would. There’s just a long line of people that I need to help first.

It’s funny because I never intersected Silk Road directly though Im sure my dealers did.    Ive become very grateful for my health.  I did a lot of very damaging things and my body is (still and thankfully) recovering.   Health is by far the most important thing.  Good luck.  Stay strong.

I need to figure out how to sell. And how to give. One of my cousins was so incredibly kind to me.  Even when I betrayed her.  I have tears in my eyes as I type this.  Tears of joy and pain at the same time.  I feel like I can finally be forgiven.

Thanks ��.  I appreciate the well wishing. Some people are being negative but I need to focus on being positive.  The problem with addition is that you are never free.  It’s always calling to you.  I’m going to need to go to the meetings more often.  For some reason this has triggered a strong urge.   But it’s been long enough now and I know better.  There are so many people that I can help though.   Need to take some time to process this.

Odd backstory is the story of my life.  I don’t blame you for not believing me.  Until my parents died I lived a great life.  Out of there SPU (edit: therapy) I have learned that I use drugs to try and keep my old life.   I keep my old world alive.  Crazy things happen when you need to live in the past and avoid the pain of the present.    I wish you member have to go through this.  One moment your parents are going to a dinner party and the next moment you are putting them into the ground. And everyone else’s life goes on but yours just stops.  Completely.  Anyways.  Don’t do drugs

I’m planning on selling 50% but happy to get advice.  I see a lot of skepticism.  I guess that’s just the internet.
