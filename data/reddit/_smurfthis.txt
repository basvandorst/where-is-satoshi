How does it work behind the scenes?

Actually, it really is. Hypothetically, let’s say I sold a bunch of BTC on GDAX for a total of $1 million. I’d only be able to withdraw $10,000 per day to my bank account so it would take me 100 days to withdraw all of it. If I wanted to buy a decked out Tesla Model S this way, I would need to wait a minimum of 10 days to withdraw the necessary USD. If Tesla accepted BTC directly, I would only need to wait about an hour to get my transaction confirmed. How is that not better? Now imagine I want to use to that $1 million to buy a house instead. Wait 100 days for full withdrawal or spend BTC directly?
Yes you may be able to increase your fiat withdrawal limits from exchanges, but from what I’ve heard, they rarely increase for the random Joe since the $10K limit is in place for AML reasons.

Arbitrage is when you buy on one exchange and immediately sell the same amount on another exchange and make the price differential as profit. Thus, you’d need to spread the 8500 coins across ALL exchanges as the bots would pretty much instantaneously equalize the price. So in reality, I don’t see 8500 dropping the overall price by more than like $50 across all exchanges.

Which really makes no sense unless they really just want to support the project or they don’t have access to an exchange. If you’re going to mine at a loss, hoping for the price to rise in the future, just take what you would have paid for electricity and buy BTC directly on an exchange.

It's the psychological aspect like someone else mentioned. People, on thr average, would want to see that they own 5 btc instead of 0.000000005 btc.
