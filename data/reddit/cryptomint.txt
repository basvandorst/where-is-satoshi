We pay &lt;$10/month for insurance that covers specifically this situation since it is outside the coverage of our homeowner's insurance.

Here's a question I can't seem to find an answer to: as an American citizen, would I be able to transfer cryptos in to Kraken and day trade between crypto and fiat, as long as I don't cash out in fiat?  It seems that I will need Level one verification to do this, which is fine, but I am not sure they will allow it if I am an American?
*edit: nevermind, looks like they only allow crypto&gt;crypto trades for me :(*

Escrows are a possibility now and will be e bigger deals in the future. I'd wager a guess that escrow fees could be very competitive with CC fees in the future

If the state doesn't become involved, then how does the corporation not become the new state?
Nature abhors a vacuum, how does another power not move in to replace the state when the power it occupies vacates?
