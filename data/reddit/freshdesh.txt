as a client of Anthem Vault, I'm excited to see their integration in to the crypto sector.  If gold is to be used as money again, it's my opinion that it needs to be digitized.

Great post!  GOOOO WOLFPACK!!!!

Nope, bitcoin was the payment method, the price of the laptop was in USD.  Check out the Newegg.com website.  Are their prices in USD or BTC?  Good try tho, although I doubt your accounting experience.  
@_date: 2014-08-21 01:05:54
yes, i would be.  USD is the base currency.  This is exactly what I would expect.  
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:02:24
offered my $0.02 to the conversation.  This is very interesting to me and i've been thinking about what a Crypto-bank would consist of for a while.

Do we even want Net Neutrality?  Doesn't an Internet with packet priority offer many advantages?  
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:29:47
Agreed.  I'm stuck in a very unfortunate situation, especially since they say that I'm not allowed to resell the giftcard.  I want a specific laptop or the Bitcoins back....not $1200 in giftcards.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:54:31
what if the price rose instead?  Should they have to give me back the full 1.8btc?  It appears that bitcoiners aren't very good at accounting.  No, obviously I should have received less if the bitcoin price rose since the base currency is in USD.  There's a lot of hate on this thread, but the important point is that companies haven't yet understood how to transact in the Bitcoin community which is holding back acceptance.  
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:00:39
Warning with Newegg - if you pay in Bitcoin, they will not provide a refund, only a gift card.  Even if they come back to you saying that your product is "out of stock" after the fact....you MUST take a gift card.  
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:47:55
nice, but look longer term.    
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:51:02
They couldn't give me USD back, since I paid in btc.  I was only asking for the same value in USD back.  Why is this so hard?  
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:13:40
GO PACK!!!!
@_date: 2014-10-10 00:03:22
More of this "moon" talk.  smh
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:57:01
that's simply not true.  The price on the website for the laptop was in USD.  I understand volatility, but there's a reason why we must pay within 15minutes....why is the other side excluded from this?  
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:59:08
understood, but for accounting purposes this doesn't make sense unless you run your business with BTC as the base currency (which they don't).  I guess that I was foolish in thinking that r/Bitcoin would have users who are affluent in accounting.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:53:07
again, I wasn't allowed USD back.  The only option was a gift card since giving btc back was illegal.  Then that changed all of a sudden.  If the laptop was priced on the website as 1.8btc, this would be a different story, but it was $1200 USD.  Why is it unreasonable to receive the $1200 equivalent back, but using Bitcoin as the payment method?  
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:24:07
"inherent risks" - please continue.  
@_date: 2014-06-25 13:50:38
"eroding net neutrality"   please define.  
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:08:28
who are you using to clear Bitcoins?  Who is your merchant provider?  
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:02:53
very important.  Go Pack!!
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:06:14
the computer was priced in USD, not bitcoins.  To provide an actual refund, shouldn't the same amount of USD be refunded?  The gift card they offered was the same in USD....why not Bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:58:00
you are the only one with any sense here.  Yes, it is standard practice to refund in the BASE CURRENCY which is displayed as the price on the website.  This is the main issue (well, and them making up laws).  
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:04:58
I support competing currencies, best of luck!  
@_date: 2016-01-11 16:04:38
Short and sweet interview!  Interesting hearing Andreas talk about himself with a non-bitcoin theme.
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:28:33
I care!
@_date: 2016-06-06 02:46:47
great interview!
@_date: 2015-07-24 16:26:59
So I can fund my CryptoCapital personal account by sending bitcoin to Coinapult and they will send the fiat to CryptoCapital?
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:34:23
i tested it out and it worked great!  Only tried it with $5 increments, but seemed very smooth.  
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:28:58
This is the most retarded thread on Reddit.  L2P
