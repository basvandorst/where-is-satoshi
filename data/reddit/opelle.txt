This is requiring bitcoin to actually be a currency though, which is currently isn’t. I’m not trying to shit on bitcoin as I have money currently in bitcoin, eth and ltc. I just think that it is going to be a long long time (if ever) until bitcoin can be used as a currency so we can’t possibly view it as one yet unfortunately.

Bitcoin won’t hit 100k. What reason would there be for it? I’m not here to shit in bitcoin, just there is no technological or economical reason for it currently to reach anywhere near that figure. 
You’ve just arbitrarily picked a number you like without any facts.

This is a really good reply, and it’s most likely that I don’t fully understand the process of price changes, although my current feeling is that the market cap of bitcoin at $100,000 is so big that for that amount of USD to be invested to create that much money would take a lot longer than people seem to think.

Litecoin could also take over. As could bitcoin cash. I know it’s an unpopular opinion here (I have no bitcoin cash so not saying that as a biased opinion) as they’re both currently better solutions in terms of an actual currency.

I got the impression he was being sarcastic, and was joking, but may I be wrong!
