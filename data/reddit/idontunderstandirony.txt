* KYC/AML regulations
* Money transmitter license cost (different license fees/requirements per state)
* Finding a bank that will deal with MSBs especially those involved with Bitcoin
The first two are supposedly dealt with for you if you sign on with Robocoin. The last is still going to be a problem for most prospective Bitcoin ATM businesses.

I'm pretty sure mine is clean, but Avast and Kaspersky are both showing false-positive detection according to VirusTotal. I'm guessing someone wrapped the real ticker app with a trojan and the AV analysts couldn't tell the good code from bad.

Yes. The fees are a little on the high side but it works. Took about 30 minutes to get the BTC. You need to have a working bank account number however, they ask for it as an anti-fraud measure.

Unless the way your Bitcoin business works would qualify you as an MSB under the FinCEN guidelines. In which case opening a commercial account with the bank and not informing them of your status could get you in a lot of legal trouble. 
Banks aren't just leery of Bitcoin, the mere mention of being a MSB is enough to have them reject your application in a lot of cases unfortunately, due to the regulatory overhead and severe penalties for them (and you) if you don't follow the AML/KYC regulations.

It sure looks like the 5 BTC went to a change address. OP, what does your Bitcoin-QT balance/history show? You can't rely on Blockchain.info for your wallet balance, it can only show you the balance of a single address.
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:41:37
Yeah, you're infected with something that has stolen your exchange passwords either by keylogger or by taking them from your browser's credential store. Hopefully you don't store any of your wallet files on the same system. If you do, definitely do not unencrypt them before backing them up and reformatting your system, because the thief likely has already downloaded them and is just waiting for you to type in your passphrase.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:43:30
Even if that were true, it would indicate that Mt. Gox is storing user passwords in plain text somewhere. That alone would be justification to abandon Mt. Gox forever, let alone all the other past issues.

In that case, your next poll should be "How long do you think it will be until your Bitcoins are stolen by malware?" 
Sadly, it's depressing to watch the misconceptions about computer security and antivirus out there. "My computer is secure, I have Norton AV!" or "I lost all my coins but MBAM showed my computer was clean!" or "I use 2FA, there's no way someone can access my exchange account!"

How was it lost exactly? If it's disk corruption/reformatting there might be a chance to recover.

You're right, they weren't being lazy, they were being slimy. Five days artificially delayed simply to extort people to pay a premium next time around. (Nice package you got there, would be a shame if we had to lose it for a week or two...)
I paid for ground shipping. It arrived at their facility three or four days after, it's not unreasonable for me to expect to claim the package after that time had passed given the amount I paid. It's not like I was demanding to get overnight or second-day speed for the price of ground.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:24:44
DHL is the worst. They once held a package of mine that arrived 5 days earlier than scheduled. It was literally sitting at their office 2 miles from my house, and they refused to let me pick it up in person, I had to wait 5 days for it to be delivered the last 2 miles.

I think she is saying transaction malleability can't cause a Bitcoin address to reflect a different balance than it should, so therefore Mt. Gox is lying about the malleability issue being at fault. She makes the assumption that Mt. Gox kept each user's balance in separate addresses. 
I think that it's more likely that they just had a slush-fund split between hot wallet and cold wallet, and kept track of user balances with a separate accounting system. Therefore their inability to reconcile the virtual accounts with the real-world transactions from their slush-fund (due to their faulty reliance on tx hashes as a unique payment identifier) is what led to the problem.
I don't know for sure how it worked, though, since I've (luckily) never sent any BTC to Mt. Gox.

Bitcoin-qt doesn't work offline. You want Electrum or Armory. Offline instance holds the key to sign transactions. Online instance (sans private key) can watch the transactions, balance, create unsigned transactions etc.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:10:46
blockchain.info marks my TrustedCoin address as "strange" when the transaction is first picked up (that designation disappears after it is included in a block apparently). Seems like they aren't expecting to see p2sh addresses.
The blockchain.info iPhone wallet app refuses to even send coins to my TrustedCoin address, claiming it's not a valid Bitcoin address. I wonder how many other wallets will reject sending to the address because it doesn't start with "1"?
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:18:25
Any wallet sitting on a computer connected to the Internet is technically an "online" wallet. You are asking about the security of a web wallet vs a desktop wallet. Neither is secure. 
What you want (until hardware wallets are widely available) is a "split" wallet, i.e. a watch-only wallet on your desktop that can see your addresses' balances and can create unsigned transactions, and a corresponding offline wallet on a permanently un-networked computer that holds your private keys and can sign the unsigned transactions (carried by sneakernet) from your watch-only wallet. 
Electrum or Armory can both be set up this way.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:08:40
These coins were in your desktop wallet? If so you are probably infected with coinstealing malware. Use deterministic wallet software like Armory or Electrum next time - keep your keys off your daily-use PC.

Google doesn't just let anyone proxy through their IP ranges. I suspect your web browser is leaking URLs to Google that they are subsequently spidering. Do you have the Google toolbar installed in order to view PageRank of pages you visit? That would cause such behavior.

Ok. For the record my response to this would have been: deterministic wallet (Electrum). Watch-only wallet on the primary PC, private keys are on an offline Raspberry Pi computer with seed backup stored on paper.

A friend and I worked on a similar app using Electrum. We ran into the problem that the size of transactions with a lot of inputs would exceed the available capacity of the QR code standard. Did you manage to solve this problem?

@_date: 2014-01-21 02:31:22
Sounds great until you consider the cost of complying with the various money transmitter licenses and KYC/AML regulations. That's assuming you can get a bank that even allow you to open an commercial account with them as a money services business (MSB) due to the regulatory overhead it causes for them.
If you're not in the U.S. it might be easier but I don't know.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:29:00
This provides extra security only in a limited circumstance - if your account doesn't have 2FA and someone manages to guess/MitM-sniff your password (or you reuse the same password elsewhere and that site is hacked). It does not protect you if:
* The exchange itself is hacked
* Your Internet-connected computer with your private keys on it is infected with malware 
I think the above two scenarios are more often the reason why people's coins are stolen from exchanges. Also note that 2FA doesn't necessarily prevent coin theft in either of those two scenarios either.
To secure individual user accounts from malware, exchanges should use transaction integrity verification (e.g. Cronto, 3AKEY+) to secure withdrawals, orders or other account changes. 
End-users should use hardware wallets or BIP 32 deterministic wallets in a split configuration.

2FA won't a difference if you are infected with browser-injecting malware. It came for the banks and it's coming for exchanges/web wallets. We need to be proactive and move to transaction integrity verification using offline cryptographic hardware devices.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:24:58
It needs to have a display so the transaction details can be verified independently of the (potentially compromised) computer, or else malware could alter the transaction in memory before the device signs it.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:39:47
The data may still be recoverable then. Stop using that computer immediately to avoid overwriting more of the disk, then use another computer to read up on forensic recovery tools.

They said it was already loaded on a truck for delivery so they wouldn't be able to locate it with all the other boxes. So I guess they load trucks and leave them parked in the garage until someone gets time to drive them. 
I suspect they could have looked up which truck it was on and found the box within a couple of minutes searching, but were just too lazy to do so. Even though I paid the shipper for the shipping costs, technically I'm not their customer, so they can tell me to take a hike and there's really nothing I could do about it.

You're right, you plug the HW-1 into a separate non-networked computer for transaction display which allows you to cut production costs and not need an embedded display. As long as you can verify the transaction's integrity before signing it's a workable solution.

Essentially if a thief can get malware onto your machine, it can change everything you see in the browser, while manipulating the real transaction behind the scenes. You enter one-time-password during login to the exchange? The malware intercepts it and and opens a hidden window with the logged-in page, while displaying a fake "login failed" message to you after a short delay. 
Meanwhile the malware orchestrates the logged-in hidden browser session to empty your wallet to an external address. Oh, that also requires a one-time-password to authenticate? No problem, you just tried to log in a second time to the "failed login" screen and supplied a second code.
@_date: 2013-12-22 13:25:48
Although you should definitely use it when offered, one-time-password 2FA has been broken by banking malware for quite some time; it will soon be bypassed by Bitcoin-stealing malware. It should only be considered a stop-gap until better solutions are widely available such as requiring secure cryptographic transaction verification on an offline device.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:20:22
I like it but I'd also like to see a more portable solution that could be used in combination with a watching-only wallet on a smartphone. Something that would communicate unsigned/signed transactions to the hardware device via camera+QR code (would probably require animated QR codes or something similar since the transaction size could easily exceed a single QR code's size limit given enough inputs).
