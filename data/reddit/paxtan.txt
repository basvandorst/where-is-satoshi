Hey, so this is the payment I sent, so as soon as this confirms, and I am sure that the public address is correct, I can send all the rest? Also, the QR code that it shows on the website for my public address that I linked is different from the one of the card can there be multiple QR codes for one Address of does that mean I did something wrong?

I've been on this ride for a while and I am most likely not getting off until I need the money for college. And honestly, I won't be mad if I lose 250 I wouldn't have put it in if that was the case.

It's college money and it's going to stay college money for 4 more years. Hopefully Bitcoin will help me get through college!

I was thinking about taking it out but I think it's fine. If I lose it I wouldn't be too mad and I think I would just be more mad if it went way up and I had less coins. Also saying I was 14 was just so like younger people could see that they could do it too.
