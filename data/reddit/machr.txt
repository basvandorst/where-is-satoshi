I've used this service before and it only took a week before I had my passport. 
Not sure if you're trolling though.

What happens if the price falls. You'll be stuck with $30k loan

I sold 2/3 of mine at around 605 AUD. Waiting to see what happens in the next few weeks.

I have bought 2-3x as many as my previous holding, in the last few weeks. I might sell a few if it explodes but otherwise I'm long on bitcoin

@_date: 2015-10-22 21:11:50
