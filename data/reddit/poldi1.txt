I am actually wondering why this isn't happening a lot more with localbitcoins deals...

The plate implies he is using his BTC for payments rather than holding on to them...

Never try to catch the falling knife

You have a valid point there, but still I would take incoming transactions into account as well to get a more precise picture of how many coins are really lost. Maybe with an extra filter for minimum number/size of incoming transactions. Like min. 3 transactions with total vol. of min. 0.001BTC per year tells me this is someones saving/hodl wallet.
Edit: per year

Yeah go for it

well I have BTC, just not in a wallet outside of Bitfinex and sending them to another wallet just to pass them through seems not feasible for a 30$ amount
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:02:39
Why only outgoing transactions? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:38:03
I wanna send the amount from Bitfinex since I don't have BTC wallet (only altcoins). 
Sending the BTC to a suitable wallet first would be stupid with the current fees.
So it would be great if someone can confirm this works directly out of Bitfinex wallet.

Maybe you need to fiddle with the numbers a little but it should work out

Upvoted for visibility. Google scam ads targeting crypto users are getting out of hand...

Recently there have been a lot of paid ads for crypto related phishing sites in Googles top results - disgusting! I guess a simple algorithm at Google Ads could flag potential phishing sites for further review just by checking for name/domain similarities, but I guess their revenue is more important.

Are you saying there are NO FEES at itBIT? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:34:40
Talking about your savings and you monthly wages are 2 different things. Keep your savings a secret, but keep talking about your wages to your co-workers and other people for the above stated reasons. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:30:10
I like your thinking on inflation 
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:27:42
Why don't exchanges show their fees directly at a transaction and on a general info page? I buy my coins at a german site (bitcoin.de) mostly, and they do it. Very convenient.
